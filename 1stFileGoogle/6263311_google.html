A plurality of acceptable voice patterns is generated from sounds of authorized users and stored in the security system. Sounds in the space to be protected are detected and a current voice pattern is generated from at least one sound detected in the space to be protected. The current voice pattern is compared with entries in the stored voice lists to determine a level of difference or a level of similarity between the current voice pattern and the content of the voice list. If the determined level constitutes a discrepancy according to predetermined criteria, an alarm response is initiated. Further, if the determined level constitutes a matching between the current voice pattern and an entry in an emergency list of voice codes that were entered by authorized users, a predetermined emergency action is performed.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>The present invention relates generally to security systems and more particularly to security systems with voice recognition functions.</p>
    <p>2. Description of the Relevant Art</p>
    <p>The use of security systems to protect people and buildings has seen an increasing demand. The basic idea of a security system is sensing a predetermined parameter and delivering a response upon changes in the value of that parameter. The parameter(s) detected by the security system usually indicates the existence of an unacceptable condition, such as an open door which should be closed, the presence of an intruder, or a condition of an emergency nature (such as fire or flood). Security systems employ many types of sensors such as motion sensors for both the indoors and outdoors, glass-break detectors, magnetic contact sensors, flood detectors, temperature sensors, smoke detectors, sensitized door mats, etc. The use of specific sensors and security systems vary from person to person and from building to building based on the security needs and concerns.</p>
    <p>Security systems have continuously become more complex as the employment of different technologies in security systems has substantially increased to combat security challenges. Many of today's security systems employ some software programming and hardware adjustments to provide control functions and automation, such as operating lights, appliances, thermostats, motorized drapes, phones, and other devices. A security system may be configured to send an emergency signal to a specific party, such as dialing a police or a physician upon detection of an emergency condition. The emergency condition is usually programmed or pre-entered in the security system. The initiation of an action (when emergency conditions exist) is either prompted by the user or automatically started by the security system.</p>
    <p>To increase the functionality of security systems, so that they meet changing security needs, modem security systems may employ existing or dedicated phone lines and phone systems to deliver extended functionality. For example, a security system may be configured to initiate an intercom phone call upon detecting knocking on the door, whereby the user is able to converse with visitors before opening the door. Further, a security system's owner may call a security system from a remote location using a phone to change security setup or conditions. Although the owner accesses the security system by entering a password or a form of access information, an unauthorized user may be able to disarm the system or change the existing security criteria if he knows the access information, thus straying the value of the security system.</p>
    <p>Many security systems utilize a telephone control module that converts touch-tone tones into control commands. Any command that is enacted by the security system may now be performed from the keypad of a touch-tone phone. For example, if a user forgets to arm the security system while leaving his house, the arming of the system may be performed by a few keys on the car phone. Therefore, developments in telephony and other technologies contribute to the sophistication of security systems, for example, using computer links, through serial port connections, to provide advantages of a processor or building security systems with their own processors.</p>
    <p>As mentioned above, the integration between the security system and other technologies of home and office automation provides an extended functionality and complexity to security systems. Unfortunately, security systems are still vulnerable to unauthorized individuals. An unauthorized individual may reach the protected areas without detection by the security system. For example, an owner may admit an unauthorized individual into the protected area before realizing the mistake. An individual may reach the protected area by passing sensors without detection. An unauthorized individual may breach the security system with stolen access information. A security need may arise without prior identification of an unauthorized individual. Further, a security need may arise independent of the existence of an unauthorized individual. Therefore, reducing or eliminating the security systems vulnerability is desirable. Further, increasing the capability of the security systems to satisfy even better security needs is also desirable.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention comprises method and system for detecting an unauthorized presence in a space (such as a room) to be protected, or subjected to security measures. The protection is provided by detecting the voice or sound of an intruder, or an unauthorized user, in the space that is subjected to the security measures. Further, the method and system provide additional security measures to the space to be protected by providing recognition to predetermined voice codes provided by authorized users. A voice list including a plurality of authorized voice patterns is generated and stored. When the system is activated, sensors in the space to be protected are employed to detect sounds in the space. The detected sound is indicative of a sound source in the protected space and the sound source is indicative of a presence (authorized or unauthorized) in the space to be protected. The detected sound is used to generate a current voice pattern indicative of the characteristics of the sound source. The generated current voice pattern is compared against the plurality of authorized voice patterns that were stored in the voice list. If the current voice pattern matches an entry in the voice list (based on predetermined criteria), then the detected sound indicates an authorize presence (such as a homeowner), otherwise the detected sound indicates an unauthorized presence (such as an intruder). If an unauthorized presence is detected, in the space to be protected, the system is configured to initiate an alarm response.</p>
    <p>The method and system further comprise initiating an alarm response if the current voice pattern matches a special voice pattern (or voice code) of an authorized user in the space to be protected. Voice codes may be stored along with voice patterns in the voice list or may be stored in a separate emergency voice list that contains only voice codes. Upon a determination of a match between a generated voice pattern and a voice code, a predetermined special action is initiated by the system. Thus, an alarm response may be triggered based on the detection of a voice code (that is indicative of an emergency need) by an authorized user requesting an action (such as dialing 911) to be performed by the security system.</p>
    <p>Broadly speaking, the present invention contemplates a method and system that advantageously improve the security of a space, to be protected, by providing detection and recognition to sounds generated in that space. The sound is detected by a sound sensor and processed in a voice recognition unit to generate a current voice pattern. The current voice pattern is compared with a plurality of authorized voice patterns that are stored in a voice list in the system. The authorized voice patterns reference the presence of authorized sounds in the space, such as those generated by authorized individuals. If the detected sound, upon processing in the voice-processing unit, indicates a presence of an unauthorized individual or an emergency request by an authorized user, the system is configured to initiate an alarm response that advantageously provides better security measures to the protected space and its users.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading> <p>Turning now to FIG. 1, a block diagram of a security system is shown that provides voice recognition and improves security by detecting an unauthorized presence in a space to be protected. In one embodiment, the security system <b>100</b> utilizes an X number of sound sensors <b>110</b>A, <b>111</b>B, <b>110</b>C, . . . , <b>100</b>X, to detect sounds generated in the space to be protected. The number of sensors used in system <b>100</b> depends on the size and type of the space to be protected, the security needs of the space, and the spectrum of sound frequencies to be covered in the security design of the space. In this description, the reference to a group of elements which share the same numeric (such as <b>110</b>A, <b>111</b>B, <b>110</b>C, . . . , <b>110</b>X) may be collectively indicated by referring to the numeric alone. For example, the numeric <b>110</b> is used to collectively reference sound sensors <b>111</b>A, <b>110</b>B, <b>110</b>C, . . . , <b>110</b>X. Sound sensors <b>110</b> may be transducers (or transmitters) that generate voltage (or current) signals in response to changes in acoustic waves received by the sensors. In one embodiment, sensors <b>110</b> are of the same type. They may be distributed in different locations in the space to be protected based on the space's security needs. In another embodiments, sensors <b>110</b> are of different types to provide a wide spectrum of sound detection capabilities appropriate to the space's security needs. Preferably; the number, type, and distribution of sensors <b>110</b> are selected to satisfy the security needs of the space to be protected.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, sensors <b>110</b> are coupled to a voice-processing unit <b>120</b>. Signals generated by sensors <b>110</b> are transmitted to unit <b>120</b> for processing. The voice-processing unit <b>120</b> comprises a voice recognition unit <b>140</b> and a voice list <b>130</b>. The voice recognition unit <b>140</b> may be any voice recognition unit that is suitable to the security needs of the space to be protected. The voice recognition unit <b>140</b> preferably comprises a processor, such as CPV or DSP, which executes voice recognition software from a memory. The voice list preferably comprises a random access memory. In one embodiment, the voice list <b>130</b> is included within the memory of the voice recognition unit <b>140</b>. Alternatively, the voice list <b>130</b> may be included within the voice-processing unit <b>120</b> as an external element to the voice recognition unit <b>140</b>. In the embodiment of FIG. 1, the voice list <b>130</b> is configured to store a plurality of voice patterns. Generally speaking, the voice patterns stored in the voice list <b>130</b> are “acceptable” or “authorized” voice patterns of recognized users. The acceptable voice patterns are those patterns of authorized individuals whom when they are present in the space to be protected do not constitute a security concern. For example, the voice list <b>130</b> stores sounds of an owner of the security system, sounds of other family members in the home, and may be sounds of other individuals who may be normally visiting the house such friends, cleaning personnel, and babysitters. The voice list <b>130</b> may further include non-human sounds such as pets in the house.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, the voice recognition unit <b>140</b> is employed to generate acceptable voice patterns from normal conversations of authorized users. A recording may be initiated, by an authorized user, to record sounds of authorized individuals during their conversations. The recorded conversations may be used to create voice patterns for the authorized individuals that are stored in the voice list <b>130</b>. Alternatively, voice patterns may be generated by recording specific words and phrases pronounced by each of the authorized individuals. The generated voice patterns are stored in the voice list <b>130</b>. Generally speaking, each voice pattern includes at least one word pronounced by an authorized user. The user is any human or non-human source of sound. Since the voice list <b>130</b> is developed from acceptable voice patterns, the availability of a sound, generated by a source in the space to be protected, that matches (based on predetermined criteria) at least one entry in the voice list <b>130</b> may be considered acceptable.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, the voice-processing unit <b>120</b> is configured to analyze at least one sound detected by one of the sound sensors <b>120</b> in the space to be protected. Analysis of the detected sound includes generating a current voice pattern. The current voice pattern is generated when one or more of the sensors <b>110</b> transmit at least one signal to the voice-processing unit <b>120</b>. Therefore, the current voice pattern is indicative of the sound source in the space to be protected. Upon the generation of the current voice pattern, the voice-processing unit <b>120</b> compares the current voice pattern with the voice patterns stored in the voice list <b>130</b>. The result of the comparison between the current voice pattern and the content of the voice list <b>130</b> indicates if the current voice pattern has correspondence (for example, similarity) with at least one of the voice patterns that were stored in the voice list <b>130</b>. Accordingly, if the result of the above comparison indicates a current voice pattern that is not within an acceptable range of correspondence (according to predetermined criteria), an unacceptable voice pattern is detected.</p>
    <p>Generally speaking, the detection of the unacceptable voice pattern by the voice-processing unit <b>120</b> indicates the existence of an unauthorized presence in the space to be protected. In one embodiment, the voice recognition unit <b>140</b> performs the generation and analysis of the current voice patterns. It is noted that many levels of voice-processing sophistication are known in the art. Any level of sophistication that is satisfactory to the needs of the security system may be implemented by the voice-processing unit <b>120</b>. Therefore, the level of sophistication for the voice-processing functions of system <b>100</b> is dependent on the depth of the security needs in the space to be protected. The description of a specific sophistication is not intended to restrict the present invention, but rather it is presented as an example. Accordingly, any level of sophistication of voice-processing for system <b>100</b> is contemplated in the present invention.</p>
    <p>In the embodiment of system <b>100</b>, the voice-processing unit <b>120</b> is configured to assert at least one signal to control unit <b>150</b> when a discrepancy, between the current voice pattern and the content of the voice list <b>130</b>, is detected. The discrepancy between the current voice pattern and the content of the voice list <b>130</b> may be obtained when the current voice pattern matches no entry in the voice list <b>130</b>. Alternatively, a discrepancy may be also obtained based on a partial matching (instead of no matching) between the current voice pattern and the content of the voice list <b>130</b>. The decision on the “size” of difference between the current voice pattern and the content of the voice list <b>130</b> that would constitute a discrepancy, between the current voice pattern and the content in the voice list <b>130</b>, is dependent on the voice-processing unit <b>120</b> sophistication and the depth of the security needs in the space to be protected. Furthermore, two or more levels of sophistication may be utilized by the voice-processing unit <b>120</b>. In the latter, the level of sophistication to be used in analyzing the detected sounds by sensors <b>110</b> is at least dependent on the nature of sound detected by one or more of the sensors <b>1</b> <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>A first level of sophistication for the voice-processing functions of system <b>100</b> may be employed to arrive into a discrepancy between a current voice pattern and the content of the voice list <b>130</b> based on a total mismatch. A second level of sophistication may be employed by the voice-processing unit <b>120</b> to arrive into a discrepancy based on a partial mismatch. For example, when a sound form an unauthorized individual is detected by the voice-processing unit <b>120</b>, a discrepancy is obtained. As mentioned above, the decision when a discrepancy occur depends on the level of sophistication chosen for the voice-processing functions of the voice-processing unit <b>120</b>, and the depth of the security measures needed in the space to be protected.</p>
    <p>Control unit <b>150</b> is configured to control signal at least one of the control devices <b>160</b>A, <b>160</b>B, . . . , <b>160</b>X, when a discrepancy (between the current voice pattern and the content of the voice list <b>130</b>) is obtained by the voice-processing unit <b>120</b>. The number of control devices <b>160</b> may vary depending on the “action” (or the alarm response) that the system <b>100</b> is designed for. Further, a control device <b>160</b> may be any device adapted to perform a function in response to a control signal received from the control unit <b>150</b>. For example, a control device <b>160</b> may be an audio alarm, a visual alarm, an electrical door locker/opener, a power controller, a light controller, a phone system, a module to dial a number through the phone system, a display device . . . etc.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, the control unit <b>150</b> is configured to perform a sequence of actions upon one or more of the assertion signals received from the voice-processing unit <b>120</b>. In another embodiment, the sequence of actions performed by the control unit <b>150</b> is dependent on a second group of assertion signals supplied by the voice-processing unit <b>120</b>. In the latter, a second control action may be performed based on a second discrepancy determined by the voice-processing unit <b>120</b> after determining a first discrepancy. Further, a second control action may be performed based on the nature of the first control action. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that many combinations of the control devices <b>160</b> and configurations of the control unit <b>150</b> are possible. The above description is given as an example and is not intended to restrict the scope of the present innovation.</p>
    <p>Turning now to FIG. 1A, a block diagram of a security system that provides voice recognition and improves security by responding to a sound including an emergency voice list is shown. The security system <b>100</b>A is similar to the embodiment of system <b>100</b>, however, it includes an emergency voice list <b>135</b>. The emergency voice list <b>135</b> is generated in a manner similar to that of the voice list <b>130</b> as described above. In this embodiment, the additional voice list <b>135</b> contains special voice codes (emergency voice patterns) of authorized users. The voice codes are specific patterns of voice that are entered by authorized users. The security system is configured to perform a specific alarm response when one or more of the voice codes are detected. Accordingly, when a current voice pattern is generated, the voice-processing unit <b>120</b> compares the current voice pattern with both contents of the voice list <b>130</b> and the emergency voice list <b>135</b>. If the current voice pattern matches an entry in the emergency voice list <b>135</b>, a pre-determined alarm response is initiated. Therefore, the voice-processing unit <b>120</b> compares the current voice pattern with the content of the emergency voice list <b>135</b> looking for a matching rather than a discrepancy as in the case of the voice list <b>130</b>.</p>
    <p>As mentioned above, the voice codes (in the emergency voice list <b>135</b>) may be used to signal the security system to perform a special function by announcing one or more of the voice codes. The users of the security system already know the response of the security system when one of the voice codes is announced. For example, a code “take me to haven” may be a voice code adapted to signal system <b>100</b>A to initiate a phone call to the police. The advantage of incorporating the emergency voice list <b>135</b> is the ability to trigger the security system to perform a security function upon announcing one of the voice codes by an authorized individual. The latter case is specifically valuable when a circumstance arisen such that the authorized user is unable to perform a security function (for example, dialing 911) except by announcing a voice code. For example, an owner may initiate a 911 call while he is in company with other individuals without their knowledge or he may initiate the call while he is handicapped from reaching the phone due to an illness or accident. It should be noted that the level of full matching or partial matching required in performing the comparison between the current voice pattern and the content of the emergency voice list <b>135</b> is dependent on the level(s) of sophistication employed by the voice-processing unit <b>120</b> and on the depth of the security measures needed in the space to be protected.</p>
    <p>Turning now to FIG. 2, a flow chart of a method to provide security to a space upon detection of a sound (using voice recognition) in the space under security is shown. In the embodiment of FIG. 2, storing of a voice list is performed in step <b>210</b>. The voice list includes a plurality of voice patterns. Generally speaking, the voice patterns are “acceptable” voice patterns. The acceptable voice patterns are those which do not constitute a concern from a security standpoint. For example, the voice list that is stored in step <b>210</b> may include a sound of an owner of a house, sounds of other family members in the home, and sounds of other individuals who may be normally visiting the house such as friends, cleaning personals, and babysitters. Other sounds that may also be stored in the voice list are non-human sounds such as those of pets in the space to be protected.</p>
    <p>In step <b>220</b>, an existence of a sound in the space to be protected in detected. Detection of the sound may be achieved by any sound sensor or detector that is satisfactory to the security needs in the space to be protected. Upon detecting a sound (step <b>220</b>), a current voice pattern is generated in step <b>230</b>. The voice pattern may be a single sound or a combination of sounds. The current voice pattern generated in step <b>230</b> is analyzed with respect to the content of the voice list stored in step <b>210</b>. In step <b>240</b> a comparison between the current voice pattern and the content of the voice list is performed. The analysis of the current voice pattern with the content of the voice list may be achieved by using one or more voice recognition techniques.</p>
    <p>In step <b>250</b> a determination of a discrepancy between the current voice pattern and the content of the voice list is performed. If the result of step <b>250</b> indicates a discrepancy, one or more alarm responses are initiated in step <b>260</b>. In one embodiment, the discrepancy that is determined in step <b>250</b> (between the current voice pattern generated in step <b>230</b> and the content of the voice list stored in step <b>210</b>) is obtained when the current voice pattern matches no entry in the voice list. In another embodiment, the discrepancy may be determined based on a partial matching between the current voice pattern and the content of the voice list using predetermined criteria. The decision to be made in step <b>250</b> is generally based on the size of the difference between the current voice pattern and the content of the voice list. The size of the difference may be used to indicate an existence of a discrepancy between the current voice pattern and the content in the voice list stored in step <b>210</b>. It should be noted that the determination of a discrepancy that leads to initiating an alarm response in step <b>260</b> is dependent on the predetermined criteria. The latter is also dependent on the level of sophistication employed by the security system and the security needs in the space to be protected. It should be also noted that any level of sophistication is contemplated by the present invention. Further, more than one level of sophistication may be utilized in at least step <b>240</b>.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, the initiation of an alarm response in step <b>260</b> may include a number of actions designed to provide security measures. For example, the initiation of an alarm response in step <b>260</b> may include two or more security actions. Any of the actions may be initiated based on a level of discrepancy that is determined by step <b>250</b>. Further, a sequence of alarm responses may be initiated in step <b>260</b> upon one or more discrepancy levels that are determined in step <b>250</b>. It should be noted that the number of alarm responses is dependent on the security measures needed in the space to be protected. Further, the alarm response initiated in step <b>260</b> may also depend on both the sophistication of the comparison performed in step <b>240</b> and the security needs of the space to be protected. Generally speaking, an initiation of an alarm response in step <b>260</b> may result in the activation of one or more devices; such as audio alarms, visual alarms, electrical door lockers/openers, electric power controllers, light controllers, phone systems, controllers to dial phone numbers, display devices . . . etc.</p>
    <p>Turning now to FIG. 2A, a flow chart of a method to provide security to a space using voice recognition including an emergency voice list is shown. In the embodiment of FIG. 2A, an emergency voice list and a voice list are stored in step <b>215</b>. Steps <b>220</b>, <b>230</b>, and <b>260</b> of FIG. 2A are the same as in FIG. 2 described earlier. The emergency voice list comprises of voice codes of authorized users of the space to be protected. The voice codes in the emergency voice list may be used to signal the security system to perform a special function. The users of the security system already know the response of the security system when one of the voice codes is announced. The advantage of incorporating the emergency voice list is the ability to trigger the security system to perform an emergency function (such as calling 911) by an authorized user, while the ability of the authorized user to initiate such action is restricted otherwise.</p>
    <p>In step <b>245</b> a comparison between the current voice pattern and the contents of the voice list and the emergency voice list is performed. The analysis of the current voice pattern with the contents of the voice lists may be achieved by using one or more voice recognition techniques. In step <b>255</b> a determination of a discrepancy between the current voice pattern and the content of the voice list, or a matching between the current voice pattern and the content of the emergency voice list is performed. If a discrepancy (or a matching) exists according to predetermined criteria, one or more alarm responses are initiated in step <b>260</b>. In one embodiment, a discrepancy is obtained when the current voice pattern matches no entry in the voice list. Further, a matching is obtained when the current voice pattern matches an entry in the emergency voice list. In another embodiment, the discrepancy may be determined in step <b>255</b> from a partial matching between the current voice pattern and the content of the voice list. Likewise, the matching may be determined in step <b>255</b> from a partial discrepancy between the current voice pattern and the content of the emergency voice list.</p>
    <p>The decision to be made in step <b>255</b> is generally based on the size of either the difference or the similarity between the current voice pattern and the contents of the voice list and the emergency voice list, respectively. The size of the difference may be used to indicate an existence of a discrepancy between the current voice pattern and the content in the voice. Likewise, the size of the similarity may be used to indicate an existence of a matching between the current voice pattern and the content in the emergency voice list. It should be noted that the determination of a discrepancy, or a matching, that leads to initiating an alarm response in step <b>260</b> is depended on the level(s) of sophistication of voice-processing functions and the security needs in the space to be protected. It should be also noted that any level of sophistication is contemplated by the present invention. Further, more than one level of sophistication may be utilized in analyzing the current voice pattern and voice patterns stored in both the voice list and the emergency list at least in step <b>245</b>.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, the initiation of an alarm response in step <b>260</b> may include a number of actions designed to provide security needs. One or more of the action levels may be initiated in step <b>260</b> based on a level of discrepancy or matching that was determined by step <b>255</b>. Further, a sequence of alarm responses may be initiated in step <b>260</b> upon one or more discrepancy or matching levels determined by step <b>255</b>. It should be noted that the number of alarm responses is dependent on the security measures needed in the space to be protected or on the voice codes. Further, the alarm response initiated in step <b>260</b> may also depend on both the sophistication of the comparison performed in step <b>245</b> and the security needs of the space to be protected.</p>
    <p>Turning now to FIG. 3, a block diagram of a security system <b>300</b> incorporating a voice recognition system is shown. In one embodiment, the security system <b>300</b> includes a voice-processing unit <b>320</b>, at least one sensor <b>310</b>, a control unit <b>350</b>, and at least one control device <b>360</b>. Generally speaking, the voice recognition functions of system <b>300</b> and the alarm responses are similar to those of system <b>100</b> or <b>100</b>A described earlier. Thus, the advantages of system <b>100</b> or <b>100</b>A in relation to voice recognition may be readily integrated to traditional security systems.</p>
    <p>In the embodiment of system <b>300</b>, a plurality of sensors <b>310</b> is configured to detect at least two parameters, wherein one of the parameters is sound. The other parameters may be smoke, temperature, water, electromagnetic field, light, stress . . . etc. The number of sensors <b>310</b> may vary depending on the size of the space to be protected, the depth of the security needs, the type of the space, and the spectrum of sound frequencies to be covered in the security design of the space. A sensor <b>310</b> may be any type transducers or transmitters that are used to generate an electrical signal in response to changes in the parameter being monitored. In one embodiment, sensors <b>310</b> may be placed in different locations in the space to be protected. However, one or more of the sensors may also be placed outside the space to be protected and used to provide a reference signal.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, at least one sound sensor <b>310</b>A is coupled to the voice-processing unit <b>320</b>. The signal generated by the sound sensor <b>310</b>A is delivered to unit <b>320</b> for processing. It should be noted that a copy signal from the sensor <b>310</b>A may be provided to control unit <b>350</b> as well. In another embodiment, the sound sensor signal is provided to the voice-processing unit <b>320</b> through the control unit <b>350</b>. The voice-processing unit <b>320</b> comprises a voice recognition unit <b>340</b>, a voice list <b>330</b>, and an emergency voice list <b>335</b>. The voice recognition unit <b>340</b> may be any suitable voice recognition unit known to those skilled in the art. In one embodiment, the voice list <b>330</b> or the emergency voice list <b>335</b> is included within the voice recognition unit <b>340</b>. Alternatively, the voice list <b>330</b> or the emergency voice list <b>335</b> may be included within the voice-processing unit <b>320</b>, as an external element to the voice recognition unit <b>340</b>. In one embodiment, system <b>300</b> includes either the voice list <b>330</b> or the emergency voice list <b>350</b>. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 3, voice list <b>330</b> is adapted to store a plurality of voice patterns and the emergency voice list is adapted to store a plurality of special coded voice patterns or voice codes. The content of either the voice list <b>330</b> or the emergency voice list <b>335</b> includes at least one word pronounced by at least one user. The user is any human or non-human source of sound, in which the availability of the sound or the type of the sound generated by that source in the space to be protected indicate the presence of the sound in the space.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, the voice-processing unit <b>320</b> is configured to analyze at least one sound detected in the space to be protected. Analysis of the sound may include generating a current voice pattern. Upon the generation of the current voice, the voice-processing unit <b>320</b> compares the current voice pattern with the contents of the voice list and the emergency voice list. The result of the comparison between the current voice pattern and the content of the voice list <b>330</b> identifies a level of discrepancy, while between the current voice pattern and the content of the emergency voice list <b>335</b> identifies a level of matching. The level of discrepancy indicates the existence of an unauthorized presence in the space to be protected. The level of matching indicates the need to perform a specific security measure. The level of discrepancy or the level of matching that is determined by the voice-processing unit <b>320</b> is dependent on a size of the difference between the current voice pattern and the content of the voice list <b>330</b>, or the size of the similarly between the current voice pattern and the content of the emergency voice list <b>335</b>. It should be noted that several levels of sophistication for the voice recognition and processing functions of system <b>300</b> may be employed to suite different security needs.</p>
    <p>In the embodiment of FIG. 3, the control unit <b>350</b> of system <b>300</b> is configured to receive signals from the sensors <b>310</b> and the voice-processing unit <b>320</b>, and to supply at least one control signal to at least one of the control devices <b>360</b>. The control unit <b>350</b> uses the received signal(s) (representing sound and other parameters) to generate a control action according to predetermined criteria. Thus, system <b>300</b> integrates functions provided by traditional security systems and the voice processing functions of the present invention. The number of control devices <b>360</b> may vary depending on the action measures that the system <b>300</b> is designed for. Further, a control device may be any device adapted to perform a function in response to a control signal received from the control unit <b>350</b>. For example, a control device <b>360</b> may be an audio alarm, a visual alarm, an electrical door locker/opener, an electricity controller, a light controller, a phone system, a controller to dial a number through the phone system, a display device . . . etc. In one embodiment, the control unit <b>350</b> is configured to perform a sequence of actions upon one or more signals received from the voice-processing unit <b>320</b> and the sensors <b>310</b>. In another embodiment, the sequence of actions performed by the control unit <b>350</b> depends on signals supplied by the voice-processing unit <b>320</b> and at least one of the sensors <b>360</b>. It will be appreciated to those skilled in the art having the advantages of this disclosure that many combinations of the control devices <b>360</b> and configurations of the control unit <b>350</b> are possible.</p>
    <p>While the present invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments, it will be understood that the embodiments are illustrative and that the invention scope is not so limited. Any variations, modifications, additions and improvements to the embodiments described are possible.
