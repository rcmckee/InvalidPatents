<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
  <p num="p-0003">The present invention relates generally to protection devices, and particularly to protection devices having power to the receptacle cut-off features.</p>
  <p num="p-0004">2. Technical Background</p>
  <p num="p-0005">Most residential, commercial, or industrial buildings include one or more breaker panels that are configured to receive AC power from a utility source. The breaker panel distributes AC power to one or more branch electric circuits installed in the building. The electric circuits transmit AC power to one or more electrically powered devices, commonly referred to in the art as load circuits. Each electric circuit typically employs one or more electric circuit protection devices. Examples of such devices include ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs), arc fault circuit interrupters (AFCIs), or both GFCIs and AFCIs. Further, AFCI and GFCI protection may be included in one protective device.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">The circuit protection devices are configured to interrupt the flow of electrical power to a load circuit under certain fault conditions. When a fault condition is detected, the protection device eliminates the fault condition by interrupting the flow of electrical power to the load circuit by causing interrupting contacts to break the connection between the line terminals and load terminals. As indicated by the name of each respective device, an AFCI protects the electric circuit in the event of an arc fault, whereas a GFCI guards against ground faults. An arc fault is a discharge of electricity between two or more conductors. An arc fault may be caused by damaged insulation on the hot line conductor or neutral line conductor, or on both the hot line conductor and the neutral line conductor. The damaged insulation may cause a low power arc between the two conductors and a fire may result. An arc fault typically manifests itself as a high frequency current signal. Accordingly, an AFCI may be configured to detect various high frequency signals and de-energize the electrical circuit in response thereto.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">With regard to GFCIs, a ground fault occurs when a current carrying (hot) conductor creates an unintended current path to ground. A differential current is created between the hot/neutral conductors because some of the current flowing in the circuit is diverted into the unintended current path. The unintended current path represents an electrical shock hazard. Ground faults, as well as arc faults, may also result in fire. GFCIs intended to prevent fire have been called ground-fault equipment protectors (GFEPs.)</p>
  <p num="p-0008">Ground faults occur for several reasons. First, the hot conductor may contact ground if the electrical wiring insulation within a load circuit becomes damaged. This scenario represents a shock hazard. For example, if a user comes into contact with a hot conductor within an appliance while simultaneously contacting ground, the user will experience a shock. A ground fault may also result from equipment coming into contact with water. A ground fault may also result from damaged insulation within the electrical power distribution system.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">As noted above, a ground fault creates a differential current between the hot conductor and the neutral conductor. Under normal operating conditions, the current flowing in the hot conductor should equal the current in the neutral conductor. Accordingly, GFCIs are typically configured to compare the current in the hot conductor to the return current in the neutral conductor by sensing the differential current between the two conductors. When the differential current exceeds a predetermined threshold, usually about 6 mA, the GFCI typically responds by interrupting the circuit. Circuit interruption is typically effected by opening a set of contacts disposed between the source of power and the load. The GFCI may also respond by actuating an alarm of some kind.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">Another type of ground fault may occur when the load neutral terminal, or a conductor connected to the load neutral terminal, becomes grounded. This condition does not represent an immediate shock hazard. As noted above, a GFCI will trip under normal conditions when the differential current is greater than or equal to approximately 6 mA. However, when the load neutral conductor is grounded the GFCI becomes de-sensitized because some of the return path current is diverted to ground. When this happens, it may take up to 30 mA of differential current before the GFCI trips. This scenario represents a double-fault condition. In other words, when the user comes into contact with a hot conductor (the first fault) at the same time as contacting a neutral conductor that has been grounded on the load side (the second fault), the user may to experience serious injury or death.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">The aforementioned protective devices may be conveniently packaged in receptacles that are configured to be installed in wall boxes. The protective device may be configured for various electrical power distribution systems, including multi-phase distribution systems. A receptacle typically includes input terminals that are configured to be connected to an electric branch circuit. Accordingly, the receptacle includes at least one hot line terminal and may include a neutral line terminal for connection to the hot power line and a neutral power line, respectively. The hot power line(s) and the neutral power line, of course, are coupled to the breaker panel. The receptacle also includes output terminals configured to be connected to a load circuit. In particular, the receptacle has feed-through terminals that include a hot load terminal and a neutral load terminal. The receptacle also includes user accessible plug receptacles connected to the feed through terminals. Accordingly, load devices equipped with a cord and plug may access AC power by way of the user accessible plug receptacles.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">However, there are drawbacks associated with hard-wiring the user accessible plug receptacles to the feed-through terminals. As noted above, when a fault condition is detected in the electrical distribution system, a circuit interrupter breaks the electrical coupling between the line and load terminals to remove AC power from the load terminals. If the protective device is wired correctly, AC power to the user accessible plug receptacles is also removed. However, power to the user accessible plug receptacles may not be removed if the protective device is miswired.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">In particular, a miswire condition exists when the power lines and the are connected to the hot output terminal and the neutral output terminal, respectively. For 120 VAC distribution systems, the hot power line and the neutral power line are configured to be connected to the hot line terminal and the neutral line terminal, respectively. If the electrical distribution system includes load wires, the miswire is completed by connecting the load wires to the line terminals. A miswire condition may represent a hazard to a user when a cord connected load is plugged into the user accessible receptacle included in the device. Even if the circuit is interrupted in response to a true or simulated fault condition, AC power is present at the terminals of the receptacle because the feed-thru terminals and the receptacle terminals are hard-wired. Thus, the user is not protected if there is a fault condition in the cord-connected load.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">Besides miswiring, failure of the device to interrupt a true fault condition or simulated fault condition may be due to the device having an internal fault condition, also known as an end of life condition. The device includes electro-mechanical components that are subject to reaching end of life, including electronic components can open circuit or short circuit, and mechanical components such as the contacts of the circuit interrupter that can become immobile due to welding, and the like.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">In one approach that has been considered, the protective device is configured to trip in response to a miswire condition. Thus, if the power source of the electrical distribution system is connected to the load terminals (i.e., a line-load miswire condition), the circuit interrupting contacts will break electrical connection. The installer is made aware of the miswired condition when he discovers that power is not available to the downstream receptacles coupled to the miswired receptacle. After the miswiring condition is remedied, the interrupting contacts in the device can be reset. One drawback to this approach becomes evident when the protective device is not coupled to any downstream receptacles. In this scenario, the installer may not become aware of the miswire condition.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">Accordingly, there is a need to deny power to the user accessible receptacles when the device is tripped. This safety feature is especially needed when the GFCI is miswired.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0017">The present invention is configured to deny power to the user accessible plug receptacles when the device is tripped. Accordingly, the present invention provides a safety feature that eliminates a hazardous condition that may arise when the device is miswired.</p>

The fault detection circuit is configured to detect at least one fault condition and provide a fault detect signal in response thereto. a four-pole interrupting contact assembly is coupled to the fault detection circuit. The four-pole interrupting contact assembly includes at least one solenoid coupled to the fault detection circuit. An armature is coupled to the at least one solenoid.

The set of four-pole interrupting contacts is configured to provide electrical continuity between the first pair of hot contacts, the second pair of hot contacts, the first pair of neutral contacts, and the second pair of neutral contacts in a coupled state. The set of four-pole interrupting contacts is driven by the armature movement in the first direction to thereby interrupt electrical continuity between the first pair of hot contacts, the second pair of hot contacts, the first pair of neutral contacts, and the second pair of neutral contacts in a tripped state. A reset mechanism is coupled to the four-pole interrupting contact assembly. The reset mechanism includes a reset button and a reset actuator that selectively provides a reset stimulus in response to an actuation of the reset button. The first pair of hot contacts, the second pair of hot contacts, the first pair of neutral contacts, and the second pair of neutral contacts are necessarily driven into the coupled state by the reset stimulus.</p>

A reset mechanism is coupled to the four-pole interrupting contact assembly. The reset mechanism includes a reset button and a reset actuator configured to reestablish electrical continuity between the first pair of hot contacts, the second pair of hot contacts, the first pair of neutral contacts, and the second pair of neutral contacts in response to a reset stimulus. An end-of-life mechanism is coupled to the test assembly. The end-of-life mechanism includes an end-of-life circuit, a third pair of hot contacts coupling the hot line terminal and the hot load terminal, and a third pair of neutral contacts coupling the neutral line terminal and the neutral load terminal.

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading> <p num="p-0041">Reference will now be made in detail to the present embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. An exemplary embodiment of the wiring device of the present invention is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and is designated generally throughout by reference numeral <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0042">As embodied herein, and depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a block diagram of an electrical wiring device <b>10</b> in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention is disclosed. While <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes a GFCI, the present invention is equally applicably to AFCIs and/or other protective devices. The wiring device <b>10</b> includes a tripping mechanism that includes ground fault sensor <b>100</b> and grounded neutral sensor <b>102</b> coupled to detector <b>104</b>. Detector <b>104</b> is coupled to silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) <b>106</b>. SCR <b>106</b> is turned on in response to a detection signal from detector <b>104</b>. SCR <b>106</b>, in turn, signals trip solenoid <b>52</b> to actuate a pivotal latch mechanism <b>80</b> to open the contacts in contact assembly <b>15</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0043">With regard to contact assembly <b>15</b>, neutral line terminal <b>20</b> is connected to cantilever member <b>22</b> and cantilever member <b>26</b>. Cantilevers <b>22</b> and <b>26</b> are coupled to latch mechanism <b>80</b>. Cantilever member <b>22</b> includes a moveable contact <b>24</b>. In the reset position, moveable contact <b>24</b> is configured to mate with stationary contact <b>32</b>. Stationary contact <b>32</b> is coupled to neutral load feed-through terminal <b>30</b>. Cantilever member <b>26</b> includes moveable contact <b>28</b>. In the reset position, moveable contact <b>28</b> is configured to mate with stationary contact <b>46</b>. Stationary contact <b>46</b> is coupled to the neutral contact <b>42</b> in receptacle <b>40</b>. Hot line terminal <b>200</b> is connected to cantilever member <b>220</b> and cantilever member <b>260</b>. Cantilevers <b>220</b> and <b>260</b> are also coupled to latch mechanism <b>80</b>. Cantilever member <b>220</b> includes a moveable contact <b>240</b>. In the reset position, moveable contact <b>240</b> is configured to mate with stationary contact <b>320</b>, which is coupled to hot load feed-through terminal <b>300</b>. Cantilever member <b>260</b> includes a moveable contact <b>280</b>. In the reset position, moveable contact <b>280</b> is configured to mate with stationary contact <b>460</b>, which is coupled to the hot contact <b>48</b> in receptacle <b>40</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0044">Accordingly, when SCR <b>106</b> signals trip solenoid <b>52</b>, latch mechanism <b>80</b> pulls the cantilevers <b>22</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>220</b>, and <b>260</b> such that moveable contacts <b>24</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>240</b>, and <b>280</b> are separated from stationary contacts <b>32</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>320</b>, and <b>460</b>, respectively. When reset button <b>60</b> is depressed, reset solenoid <b>64</b> is actuated. Solenoid <b>64</b> causes latch mechanism <b>80</b> to close the aforementioned pairs of contacts to thereby restore AC power.</p>
  <p num="p-0045">The reset mechanism includes reset button <b>60</b>, contacts <b>62</b>, and reset solenoid <b>64</b>. When reset button <b>60</b> is depressed, contacts <b>62</b> are closed to thereby initiate a test procedure. If the test procedure is successful, reset solenoid <b>64</b> is actuated, and latch mechanism <b>80</b> is toggled to reset device <b>10</b>. When device <b>10</b> has an internal fault condition, the test procedure is unsuccessful, and the circuitry does not transmit a reset signal. The reset solenoid <b>64</b> is not actuated, and the device is not reset. As described above, latch mechanism <b>80</b> is toggled between the tripped state and the reset state by trip solenoid <b>52</b> and reset solenoid <b>64</b>, respectively.</p>
  <p num="p-0046">Latch mechanism <b>80</b> may be toggled to the tripped position by the fault detection circuitry, as described above, or by a user accessible test button <b>50</b>. Alternatively, latch mechanism <b>80</b> may be tripped by the fault detection circuitry, as described above, and by an electrical test button <b>50</b>′. The electrical test button <b>50</b>′ produces a simulated condition configured to test a portion of, or all of, the detection circuitry. A test acceptance signal toggles latch mechanism <b>80</b> to the tripped position. The simulated condition may be a test signal or an induced fault signal. Hereinafter, both of these signals will be referred to as simulated fault conditions.</p>
  <p num="p-0047">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a perspective view of the electrical wiring device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is disclosed. Electrical device <b>10</b> includes a circuit board <b>12</b> which is mounted on member <b>18</b>. Movistor <b>14</b> and sensor coil assembly <b>16</b> houses ground fault sensor <b>100</b> and grounded neutral sensor <b>102</b> are mounted on circuit board <b>12</b>. Circuit board <b>12</b> includes a protective circuit that is discussed in more detail below. Device <b>10</b> is configured to be coupled to AC electrical power by way of line neutral terminal <b>20</b> and line hot terminal <b>200</b> (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Power is provided to a load via load neutral terminal <b>30</b> and load hot terminal <b>300</b> (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Device <b>10</b> also provides power to user plug contacts by way of at least one receptacle <b>40</b>. Receptacles <b>40</b> include neutral contact <b>42</b>, hot contact <b>48</b>, and ground contact <b>74</b>. Ground contact <b>74</b> is electrically connected to ground terminal <b>70</b> and ground strap <b>72</b>. Similarly, device <b>10</b> and receptacle <b>40</b> can be configured for other electrical distribution systems having a single phase or multiple phase power source that include at least one hot terminal and that may include a neutral terminal and/or ground terminal.</p>
  <p num="p-0048">Line neutral cantilevers <b>22</b>, <b>26</b> are connected at one end to line neutral terminal <b>20</b>. At the other end, line cantilever <b>22</b> includes a terminal contact <b>24</b>. In similar fashion, line cantilever <b>26</b> includes a terminal contact <b>28</b> adjacent to contact <b>24</b>. Cantilevers <b>22</b> and <b>26</b> are flexibly connected to latch mechanism <b>80</b> by way of wiper arm <b>82</b>. Load neutral terminal <b>30</b> is coupled to load neutral contact <b>32</b>. Load neutral contact <b>32</b> and line neutral contact <b>24</b> form a pair of separable contacts. Receptacle neutral contact <b>42</b> is connected to member <b>44</b>. Member <b>44</b> includes neutral contact <b>46</b>. Neutral contact <b>46</b> and line neutral contact <b>28</b> also form a pair of separable contacts.</p>
  <p num="p-0049">Latch mechanism <b>80</b> is actuated by test button <b>50</b> and reset button <b>60</b>. Test button <b>50</b> is a mechanical actuator that is coupled to latch mechanism <b>80</b>. When test button <b>50</b> is depressed, each separable contact pair is separated to remove power to the feed through terminals and the receptacle terminals. Reset button <b>60</b> is an electric switch mechanism that is actuated when button <b>60</b> closes contacts <b>62</b>. Contacts <b>62</b> actuates solenoid <b>64</b>. If the test is successful, each separable contact pair is closed. The operation of dual-solenoids <b>52</b>, <b>64</b> will be discussed below in more detail.</p>
  <p num="p-0050">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a side elevation view of the electrical wiring device <b>10</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a tripped state wherein power is denied to receptacles <b>40</b>. Note that latch arm <b>88</b> is in a downward position such that line neutral contact <b>24</b> and line neutral contact <b>28</b> are not in contact with load neutral contact <b>32</b> and receptacle neutral contact <b>46</b>, respectively. The reset mechanism operates as follows. When reset button <b>60</b> activates reset solenoid <b>64</b>, latch arm <b>84</b> is forced downward, latch arm <b>88</b> is directed upward forcing flexible cantilevers <b>22</b> and <b>26</b> upward as well. This movement forces line neutral contact <b>24</b> against load neutral contact <b>32</b>, and line neutral contact <b>28</b> against neutral contact <b>46</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0051">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a top view of the electrical wiring device depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is disclosed. The “hot” side of device <b>10</b> is the mirror image of the “neutral” side of device <b>10</b>. The line hot wire from the electrical distribution system is connected to line hot terminal <b>200</b>, and the load hot wire is connected to load hot terminal <b>300</b>. Hot receptacle contacts are connected to member <b>440</b>. Cantilevers <b>220</b> and <b>260</b> include moveable hot contacts <b>240</b>, <b>280</b>, respectively. Hot contacts <b>240</b> and <b>280</b> are paired with fixed contacts <b>320</b> and <b>460</b>, respectively. Accordingly, when device <b>10</b> is in the tripped state, as described above, contact pair <b>240</b>/<b>320</b> and contact pair <b>280</b>/<b>460</b> are opened. When latch <b>80</b> is toggled by reset button <b>60</b>, reset solenoid <b>64</b> is activated. As a result, flexible cantilevers <b>220</b> and <b>260</b> are directed upward pressing line hot contact <b>240</b> against load hot contact <b>320</b>, and line hot contact <b>280</b> against receptacle hot contact <b>460</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2–4</figref>, test solenoid <b>52</b> includes an armature <b>51</b>. When solenoid <b>52</b> receives a signal from SCR <b>106</b>, a magnetic force is induced in armature <b>51</b> to drive latch arm <b>88</b> downward, causing the contacts to separate. When test button <b>50</b> is depressed by the user, a mechanical force is applied to move arm <b>88</b> downward. Test button <b>50</b> and armature <b>51</b> may be configured such that the mechanical force applied to button <b>50</b> drives latch arm <b>88</b> downward. As a result, power is removed from both the feed-through terminals (<b>30</b>, <b>300</b>) and from the receptacles <b>40</b>. When reset button <b>60</b> is depressed, contacts <b>62</b> are closed and a test routine is initiated. The protective circuit disposed on circuit board <b>12</b> generates a test signal. The circuit is configured to sense and detect the test signal. If the test signal is successfully detected, the reset solenoid <b>64</b> is activated. In response, latch <b>80</b> is toggled in the other direction. Cantilevers <b>22</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>220</b>, and <b>260</b> are spring-loaded and biased in an upward direction to close the contacts and provide power to the receptacle(s) <b>40</b> and feed-through terminals (<b>30</b>,<b>300</b>.) As noted above, if the test is not successful, solenoid <b>64</b> is not actuated and the contacts remain open.</p>
  <p num="p-0053">In this embodiment, the device is typically tripped before being installed by the user. If the device is miswired by the installer, source power is not available to the reset solenoid due to the tripped condition. The device cannot be reset. As a result, AC power is denied to the receptacles until device <b>10</b> is wired correctly.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a schematic of the electrical device <b>10</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–4</figref> is disclosed. When reset button <b>60</b> is depressed, contacts <b>62</b> are closed and a test signal is generated. If the circuit is operational, sensor <b>100</b> and detector <b>104</b> will sense and detect a differential current. A signal is provided to silicon controlled rectifier <b>106</b> and reset solenoid <b>64</b> is activated. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–4</figref>, reset solenoid <b>64</b> toggles latch <b>80</b> causing wiper arm <b>82</b> to separate from cantilevers <b>22</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>220</b>, and <b>260</b>. Cantilevers <b>22</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>220</b>, and <b>260</b> are spring-loaded and biased in an upward direction. Accordingly, the cantilevers close the contacts and provide power to the receptacles <b>40</b> and load terminals (<b>30</b>,<b>300</b>.)</p>
  <p num="p-0055">Subsequently, if the protection circuit senses and detects a fault condition, trip solenoid <b>52</b> is activated causing latch <b>80</b> to toggle in the other direction. Wiper arm <b>82</b> overcomes the spring loaded bias of the cantilevered arm and drives the cantilevers downward to thereby open the contacts and trip the device. As a result, power is removed from receptacles <b>40</b> and load terminals <b>30</b> and <b>300</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a schematic of the electrical device in accordance with an alternate embodiment of the present invention is shown. The embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is similar to the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. However, the mechanical test button <b>50</b> and the trip actuator <b>52</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are replaced by an electronic test button <b>50</b>′ in the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The electronic test button causes a simulated test fault to be generated</p>
  <p num="p-0057">Trip solenoid <b>52</b> is activated when sensor <b>100</b> and detector <b>104</b> detect a fault condition. The contacts pairs <b>24</b> and <b>32</b>, <b>28</b> and <b>46</b>, <b>480</b> and <b>460</b>, and <b>240</b> and <b>320</b> electrically decouple in response thereto, disconnecting the line, load, and receptacle contacts. TEST button switch <b>50</b>′ is accessible to the user and introduces a simulated ground fault, providing a convenient method for the user to periodically test the GFCI operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0058">Device <b>10</b> may include a trip indicator. When device <b>10</b> is tripped, trip indicator <b>130</b> is activated. Trip indicator <b>130</b> includes components R<b>9</b>, R<b>13</b>, R<b>14</b>, and D<b>1</b> (LED) which are connected in parallel with switch S<b>7</b>. When device <b>10</b> is tripped, LED D<b>1</b> is illuminated. However, when the contacts are reset, there is no potential difference to cause illumination of LED and D<b>1</b>. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that indicator <b>130</b> may include an audible annunciator as well as an illumination device.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">After device <b>10</b> is tripped, the user typically depresses reset switch <b>60</b> to reset the device. Switch S<b>7</b> is disposed in a position to supply power to the reset solenoid <b>64</b> via switch <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>. Once reset button <b>60</b> is depressed, a simulated fault is introduced through R<b>1</b>. The GFCI power supply (located at the anode of D<b>1</b>) supplies current to charge capacitor C<b>9</b>. When the detector <b>104</b> responds to the simulated fault, SCR Q<b>1</b> is turned on. When SCR Q<b>1</b> is turned on, the charge stored in C<b>9</b> will discharge through the R<b>16</b> and SCR Q<b>2</b>. As a result of the discharge current, SCR Q<b>2</b> is turned on, current flows through reset solenoid <b>64</b>, and the device <b>10</b> is reset.</p>
  <p num="p-0060">Device <b>10</b> includes a timing circuit that is configured to limit the time that the reset solenoid is ON, irrespective of the duration that the reset button is depressed by the user. Momentary activation of the reset solenoid avoids thermal damage to the reset solenoid due to over-activation. This feature also avoids the possibility of the reset solenoid interfering with circuit interruption when the trip solenoid is activated.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">Timing circuit <b>140</b> includes: diode D<b>2</b>; resistors R<b>15</b>, R<b>12</b>, and R<b>11</b>; capacitor C<b>10</b>; and transistor Q<b>3</b>. When the reset button <b>60</b> is depressed, C<b>10</b> begins charging through D<b>2</b> and R<b>15</b> while the simulated fault signal through R<b>1</b> is being introduced. C<b>10</b> is charged to a voltage that turns transistor Q<b>3</b> ON after a predetermined interval, typically one and a half line cycles (25 milliseconds). Transistor Q<b>3</b> discharges capacitor C<b>9</b>, causing Q<b>2</b> to turn off. Thus, reset solenoid <b>64</b> is activated when reset button <b>60</b> is pressed and causes SCRs Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> to turn on, and deactivates when transistor Q<b>3</b> turns on and causes SCR Q<b>2</b> to turn off. Reset solenoid <b>64</b> can be reactivated for another momentary interval if the reset button <b>60</b> is released by the user for a pre-determined duration that allows C<b>4</b> to discharge to a voltage where Q<b>3</b> turns off. Alternatively, a timer can establish momentary reset solenoid actuation by controlling the duration of the simulated test signal or the closure interval of contact <b>62</b>. Alternatively, the timer can employ mechanical and/or electrical timing methods.</p>
  <p num="p-0062">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, if device <b>10</b> has an internal fault condition that prevents SCR Q<b>1</b> from turning on, device <b>10</b> has reached an end-of-life condition. The end-of-life circuit <b>120</b> is configured to detect an internal fault condition. When the internal fault is detected, reset solenoid <b>64</b> cannot be activated, and device <b>10</b> cannot be reset to provide power to the user receptacle terminals or the load terminals. As a result of the detection, the end-of-life circuit removes power from the user receptacles and the load terminals. Removal of power by the end-of-life circuit does not rely on the reset mechanism, the reset solenoid, or the circuit interrupter.</p>
  <p num="p-0063">End-of-life (EOL) circuit <b>120</b> includes resistors R<b>19</b>–R<b>25</b>, SCR Q<b>4</b>, and diode D<b>5</b>. Resistor R<b>23</b> is configured to heat to a temperature greater than a pre-established threshold when device <b>10</b> has an internal fault. When the temperature of resistor R<b>23</b> is greater than the threshold, the line terminals decouple from the load terminals, independent of the four-pole interrupter contacts previously described. Alternatively, a resistor can be dedicated to each terminal. The resistors are heated independently to decouple the load terminals from the line terminals.</p>
  <p num="p-0064">EOL circuit <b>120</b> operates as follows. With device <b>10</b> reset, the user pushes the TEST button <b>50</b>′, and a simulated fault is introduced through R<b>25</b>. Accordingly, 120V AC power is applied to EOL circuit <b>120</b>. If the GFCI is operating properly, sensor <b>100</b>, detector <b>104</b>, and other GFCI circuitry will respond to the simulated fault and trip switches S<b>3</b>–S<b>7</b> (contact pairs <b>24</b>,<b>32</b>; <b>28</b>,<b>46</b>; <b>240</b>,<b>320</b>; <b>280</b>,<b>460</b>) within a predetermined time (typically 25 milliseconds for GFCIs.) The circuit is designed such that the simulated fault current flowing through R<b>25</b> is terminated while TEST button <b>50</b>′ is continuously being pushed. As such, power is removed from EOL circuit <b>120</b> before resistors R<b>23</b> and/or R<b>24</b> reach the temperature threshold.</p>
  <p num="p-0065">Resistors R<b>20</b>–R<b>22</b> and SCR Q<b>1</b> form a latch circuit. When device <b>10</b> is not operating properly. The uninterrupted current through R<b>21</b> will cause the resistance value of R<b>21</b> to increase significantly. When resistor R<b>21</b> changes value, the voltage divider formed by R<b>21</b> and R<b>22</b> is likewise changed. The voltage across R<b>20</b> and R<b>19</b> becomes sufficient to turn on Q<b>4</b> and current begins to flow through resistors R<b>23</b> and R<b>24</b>. In a short period of time, R<b>23</b> and R<b>24</b> begin to overheat and the solder securing R<b>23</b> and R<b>24</b> to printed circuit board <b>12</b> fails. After the solder melts, resistors R<b>23</b> and R<b>24</b> are displaced, actuating a mechanical disconnect mechanism <b>121</b>. Alternatively, the response time of R<b>23</b>, R<b>24</b> can be designed such that the solder is melted within the time test button <b>50</b> is depressed, in which case, the latch circuit can be omitted. R<b>23</b> and R<b>24</b> are directly coupled to the test circuit in this embodiment.</p>
  <p num="p-0066"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a perspective view of the EOL mechanism <b>120</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Resistors R<b>23</b> and R<b>24</b> are soldered to the underside of printed circuit board (PCB) <b>12</b>. Openings are disposed in PCB <b>12</b> in alignment with resistors R<b>23</b> and R<b>24</b>. Resistors R<b>23</b> and R<b>24</b> prevent spring loaded plungers <b>122</b> from extending through the openings <b>126</b> in board <b>12</b>. Each plunger <b>122</b> is configured to support an electrically connecting bus-bar member <b>124</b>. Each bus-bar <b>124</b> couples a line terminal (<b>20</b>, <b>200</b>) to a load terminal (<b>30</b>, <b>300</b>). As described above, when the solder supporting R<b>23</b> and R<b>24</b> melts, spring loaded plungers <b>122</b> are driven through the holes, breaking the connections between the line and load terminals. Once this occurs, there is no mechanism for resetting the device. Accordingly, the device must be replaced.</p>
  <p num="p-0067">As embodied herein and depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a block diagram of an electrical wiring device <b>10</b> in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention is disclosed. Wiring device <b>10</b> is depicted as a GFCI. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that device <b>10</b> may be configured as an AFCI or another protective device. In this embodiment, a tri-contact design is employed. This design is also a four-pole design that is configured to deny power to the receptacles when the device is miswired and in a tripped state. Line neutral <b>20</b> is coupled to fixed neutral contact <b>500</b>. Receptacle neutral contact <b>42</b> is coupled to fixed neutral contact <b>501</b>. Neutral feed through terminal <b>30</b> is coupled to fixed load neutral contact <b>502</b>. Each of the fixed contacts <b>500</b>, <b>501</b> and <b>502</b> is paired with a moveable contact <b>505</b> disposed on tri-contact mechanism <b>506</b>. On the “hot side,” each of the fixed contacts <b>508</b>, <b>510</b> and <b>512</b> is paired with a moveable contact <b>514</b> disposed on tri-contact mechanism <b>516</b>. The wiring device tripping mechanism includes ground fault sensor <b>100</b> and grounded neutral sensor <b>102</b> coupled to detector <b>104</b>. Detector <b>104</b> is coupled to silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) <b>106</b>. SCR <b>106</b> is turned on in response to a detection signal from detector <b>104</b>. SCR <b>106</b>, in turn, signals trip solenoid <b>52</b> to move tri-contact mechanism <b>506</b> and tri-contact mechanism <b>516</b> away from the fixed contacts to thereby trip device <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0068">The schematic shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> may incorporate features disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,522,510 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Miswire circuit <b>520</b>, shown in dashed lines, is included. Circuit <b>520</b> includes a miswire resistor <b>522</b> in series with a switch <b>524</b>. Switch <b>524</b> is open during manufacturing assembly to facilitate electrical testing of device <b>10</b>. After device <b>10</b> has been tested, switch <b>524</b> is closed. When device <b>10</b> is properly wired, i.e., the source of power of the electrical distribution system is connected to line terminals <b>20</b> and <b>200</b>, a constant current flows through resistor <b>522</b>. Resistor <b>522</b> is configured to open circuit when the electrical current has flowed for a predetermined time. The predetermined time is about 1 to 5 seconds. After resistor <b>522</b> has open-circuited, reset button <b>526</b> may be depressed, enabling trip mechanism <b>528</b> to enter the reset state. Optionally, a fuse or an air gap device (not shown) may be connected in series with resistor <b>522</b>. In this embodiment, resistor <b>522</b> remains closed and the fuse, or air gap device, is responsible for open-circuiting within the predetermined time.</p>
  <p num="p-0069">If device <b>10</b> is miswired, the constant flow of current through resistor <b>522</b> is not present for a sufficient amount of time, and resistor <b>522</b> fails to open-circuit. However, the current that does flow through resistor <b>522</b> is sensed by differential transformer <b>100</b> as a differential current and detected by detector <b>104</b>. Detector <b>104</b> signals SCR <b>106</b> to turn ON to thereby actuate solenoid <b>52</b>. In turn, solenoid <b>52</b> is energized, tripping the mechanism <b>528</b>. Accordingly, the current flowing through resistor <b>522</b> is interrupted before it fails. The duration of the interrupted current flow through resistor <b>522</b> is approximately the response time of device <b>10</b>, e.g., less than 0.1 seconds. The duration of the current flow is too brief to cause opening of resistor <b>522</b>. If reset button <b>526</b> is depressed to reset trip mechanism <b>528</b>, current starts to flow again through resistor <b>522</b>, however, the current is detected and mechanism <b>528</b> is immediately tripped again before resistor <b>522</b> is opened. In this manner, trip mechanism <b>528</b> does not remain in the reset state when the source of power of the power distribution system is miswired to the load terminals. Thus power is removed automatically from the receptacle terminals when the power source has been miswired to the load terminals.</p>
  <p num="p-0070">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a perspective view of the electrical wiring device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is disclosed. Protective device <b>10</b> includes a circuit board <b>12</b> which is mounted on member <b>118</b>. Movistor <b>532</b>, similar to movistor <b>14</b>, is mounted on circuit board <b>12</b>. Circuit board <b>12</b> may include either one of the protective circuits shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> or <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Device <b>10</b> is configured to be coupled to AC electrical power by way of line neutral terminal <b>20</b> and line hot terminal <b>200</b> (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). Power is provided to a load via load neutral terminal <b>30</b> and load hot terminal <b>300</b>. Device <b>10</b> also provides power to user plug contacts by way of receptacles <b>40</b>. Receptacles <b>40</b> include receptacle neutral contacts <b>42</b>, hot contacts <b>48</b>, and ground contacts <b>74</b> (not shown.) Wiring device <b>10</b> includes four-pole functionality by virtue of tri-contact mechanisms <b>506</b>, <b>516</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0071">Both neutral contact mechanism <b>506</b> and hot contact mechanism <b>516</b> are configured to be moved upward and downward with respect to the fixed contacts <b>500</b>, <b>501</b>, <b>502</b>, <b>508</b>, <b>510</b> and <b>512</b> Neutral contacts <b>505</b>, are disposed on curvilinear arms <b>534</b>. As shown, one contact <b>505</b> corresponds to line contact <b>500</b>, another to load contact <b>502</b>, and yet another to fixed neutral contact <b>501</b>. Referring to hot contact mechanism <b>516</b>, contacts <b>514</b> are disposed on arms <b>536</b>. Load hot contact <b>510</b> is not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> for clarity of illustration. However, tri-contact <b>516</b> includes three contacts <b>514</b>, one contact corresponding to hot line contact <b>508</b>, another to hot load contact <b>510</b>, and yet another contact to hot fixed contact <b>512</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0072">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, contact mechanisms <b>506</b> and <b>516</b> are coupled to latch block <b>538</b>.

Solenoid <b>52</b> is also coupled to armature <b>51</b>. When the solenoid <b>52</b> is energized, armature <b>51</b> moves toward latch block <b>538</b>, and latch mechanism <b>540</b> is directed with respect to latch block <b>538</b> to move latch block <b>538</b> in a downward direction, breaking the electrical connections between moveable contacts <b>505</b>(<b>514</b>) against fixed contacts <b>500</b>, <b>501</b>, <b>502</b> (<b>508</b>, <b>510</b>, <b>512</b>). Latch block <b>538</b> includes a cylindrical hole that is configured to accommodate a reset pin (not shown). Reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 6,621,388, U.S. application Ser.

  <p num="p-0073">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a detail view of the contact mechanism <b>506</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is disclosed. As noted above, contact mechanism <b>506</b> includes contacts <b>505</b> disposed on curvilinear arms <b>534</b>. Break spring <b>542</b> is disposed between contact mechanism <b>506</b> and cover (not shown). Axial member <b>544</b> may be provided to orient contact mechanism <b>506</b> with respect to latch block <b>538</b>, or break spring <b>542</b> with respect to contact mechanism <b>506</b>. When solenoid <b>52</b> is energized, break spring <b>542</b> forces contact mechanism <b>506</b> downward to break the contacts. It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the pertinent art that modifications and variations can be made to the shape of flexible contact mechanisms <b>506</b>, <b>516</b> of the present invention. For example, the shape of the contact mechanism <b>506</b>, <b>516</b> may be circular, triangular, Y-shaped, or any suitable shape that promotes secure contact during normal operating conditions. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows a Y-shaped contact mechanism <b>780</b>. In this embodiment, mechanism includes contacts <b>782</b> disposed on arms <b>796</b>.

  <p num="p-0075">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a perspective view of an electrical wiring device depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is disclosed. Device <b>10</b> is configured to be coupled to AC electrical power by way of line neutral terminal <b>20</b> and line hot terminal <b>200</b> (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). Power is provided to a load via load neutral terminal <b>30</b> and load hot terminal <b>300</b> (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). Device <b>10</b> also provides power to user plug contacts by way of receptacles <b>40</b>. Receptacles <b>40</b> include receptacle neutral contacts <b>42</b>, receptacle hot contacts <b>48</b>, and may include receptacle ground contact <b>74</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0076">Contact <b>808</b> is a fixed contact. Neutral load contact <b>804</b> is a two-way contact that is disposed on flexible member <b>814</b>, which is connected to load terminal <b>30</b>. Line neutral contact <b>800</b> is connected to flexible member <b>816</b>. Flexible member <b>816</b> is connected to neutral line terminal <b>20</b>. When solenoid <b>52</b> is energized, latch mechanism <b>801</b> releases contacts <b>800</b>, <b>804</b>, and <b>808</b> and device <b>10</b> is tripped.

No. 10/729,392, and U.S. application Ser. No. 10/729,396 which are incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth in its entirety, for a more detailed explanation of the reset mechanism.</p>
  <p num="p-0077">As embodied herein and depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a schematic of the electrical device depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is disclosed. The circuit depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> may also be employed in the embodiments shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–4</figref>, and <b>8</b>–<b>12</b>. The circuit is configured to introduce a simulated ground fault every period during the negative half cycle of the AC power source that the trip SCR <b>24</b> cannot conduct. If the device fails to detect the simulated ground fault, i.e., there is an internal fault condition, the device denies power to the load terminals and the receptacle(s) on the next positive half cycle. The schematic depicts a GFCI circuit for purposes of illustration, but applies to other protective devices by providing a simulated fault condition(s) during negative half cycles appropriate to the device. Device <b>10</b> protects an electrical circuit connected to load terminals <b>30</b> (<b>300</b>), and receptacle(s) <b>40</b>. Device <b>10</b> is connected to the AC power source by way of line-side neutral terminal <b>20</b> and line-side hot terminal <b>300</b>. Device <b>10</b> includes two main parts, Ground Fault Interrupt (GFI) circuit <b>900</b> and checking circuit <b>901</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0078">GFI circuit <b>900</b> includes a differential sensor <b>100</b> that is configured to sense a load-side ground fault when there is a difference in current between the hot and neutral conductors. Differential sensor <b>100</b> is connected to detector circuit <b>104</b>, which processes the output of differential sensor <b>100</b>. Detector <b>104</b> is connected to power supply circuit <b>902</b>. Power supply <b>902</b> provides power to detector <b>104</b>. Detector <b>104</b> is configured to detect a ground fault during both the positive half-cycle and the negative half cycle of the AC power. As such, detector circuit <b>104</b> provides an output signal on output line <b>903</b>. The output line <b>903</b> is coupled to SCR <b>106</b> by way of filter circuit <b>904</b>. When detector circuit <b>104</b> senses a fault, the voltage signal on output line <b>903</b> changes and SCR <b>106</b> is turned on. SCR <b>106</b> is only able to turn on during the positive half cycles of the AC power source. Further, snubber network <b>907</b> prevents SCR <b>106</b> from turning on due to spurious transient noise in the electrical circuit. When SCR <b>106</b> is turned on, solenoid <b>52</b> is activated. Solenoid <b>52</b>, in turn, causes the trip mechanism <b>80</b> (<b>528</b>, <b>801</b>) to release the four pole interrupter contacts, i.e. contacts <b>950</b>, <b>952</b>, <b>954</b>, and contacts <b>956</b>, <b>958</b>, <b>960</b>. When the interrupter contacts are released, the load-side of device <b>10</b> and the receptacle <b>40</b> are independently decoupled from the line-side power source of the electrical circuit.</p>
  <p num="p-0079">GFI circuit <b>900</b> also includes a grounded neutral transmitter <b>102</b> that is configured to detect grounded neutral conditions. Those skilled in the art understand that the conductor connected to neutral line terminal <b>20</b> is deliberately grounded in the electrical circuit. A grounded neutral condition occurs when a conductor connected to load neutral terminal <b>200</b> is accidentally grounded. The grounded neutral condition creates a parallel conductive path with the return path disposed between load terminal <b>200</b>(<b>42</b>) and line terminal <b>20</b>. When a grounded neutral condition is not present, grounded neutral transmitter <b>102</b> is configured to couple equal signals into the hot and neutral conductors. As noted above, differential sensor <b>100</b> senses a current differential. Thus, the equal signals provided by grounded neutral transmitter <b>102</b> are ignored. However, when a grounded neutral condition is present, the signal coupled onto the neutral conductor circulates as a current around the parallel conductive path and the return path, forming a conductive loop. Since the circulating current conducts through the neutral conductor but not the hot conductor, a differential current is generated. Differential sensor <b>100</b> detects the differential current between the hot and neutral conductors. As such, detector <b>104</b> produces a signal on output <b>903</b> in response to the grounded neutral condition.</p>
  <p num="p-0080">As noted initially, Device <b>10</b> includes a checking circuit <b>901</b>. Checking circuit <b>901</b> causes GFI <b>900</b> to trip due an internal fault also known as an end of life condition. Examples of an end of life condition include, but are not limited to, a non-functional sensor <b>100</b>, grounded neutral transmitter <b>102</b>, ground fault detector <b>104</b>, filtering circuit <b>906</b>, SCR <b>106</b>, snubber <b>907</b>, solenoid <b>52</b>, or power supply <b>902</b>. An internal fault condition may include a shorting or opening of an electrical component, or an opening or shorting of electrical traces configured to electrically interconnect the components, or other such fault conditions wherein GFI <b>900</b> does not trip when a grounded neutral fault occurs.</p>
  <p num="p-0081">Checking circuit <b>900</b> includes several functional groups. The components of each group are in parenthesis. These functions include a fault simulation function (<b>928</b>, <b>930</b>, <b>934</b>), a power supply function <b>924</b>, a test signal function (<b>52</b>, <b>916</b>, <b>918</b>, <b>912</b>), a failure detection function (<b>920</b>), and failure response function (<b>922</b>, <b>910</b>, <b>914</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0082">Fault simulation is provided by polarity detector <b>928</b>, switch <b>930</b>, and test loop <b>934</b>. Polarity detector <b>928</b> is configured to detect the polarity of the AC power source, and provide an output signal that closes switch <b>930</b> during the negative half cycle portions of the AC power source, when SCR <b>106</b> cannot turn on. Test loop <b>934</b> is coupled to grounded neutral transmitter <b>102</b> and ground fault detector <b>100</b> when switch <b>930</b> is closed. Loop <b>934</b> has less than 2 Ohms of resistance. Because polarity detector <b>928</b> is only closed during the negative half cycle, electrical loop <b>934</b> provides a simulated grounded neutral condition only during the negative half cycle. However, the simulated grounded neutral condition causes detector <b>104</b> to generate a fault detect output signal on line <b>903</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0083">The test signal function provides an oscillating ringing signal that is generated when there is no internal fault condition. Capacitor <b>918</b> and solenoid <b>52</b> form a resonant circuit. Capacitor <b>918</b> is charged through a diode <b>916</b> connected to the AC power source of the electrical circuit. SCR <b>106</b> turns on momentarily to discharge capacitor <b>918</b> in series with solenoid <b>52</b>. Since the discharge event is during the negative half cycle, SCR <b>106</b> immediately turns off after capacitor <b>918</b> has been discharged. The magnitude of the discharge current and the duration of the discharge event are insufficient for actuating trip mechanism <b>80</b> (<b>528</b>, <b>801</b>), and thus, the interrupting contacts remain closed. When SCR <b>106</b> discharges capacitor <b>918</b> during the negative AC power cycle, a field is built up around solenoid <b>52</b> which, when collapsing, causes a recharge of capacitor <b>918</b> in the opposite direction, thereby producing a negative voltage across the capacitor when referenced to circuit common. The transfer of energy between the solenoid <b>52</b> and capacitor <b>918</b> produces a test acceptance signal as ringing oscillation. Winding <b>912</b> is magnetically coupled to solenoid <b>52</b> and serves as an isolation transformer. The test acceptance signal is magnetically coupled to winding <b>912</b> and is provided to reset delay timer <b>920</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0084">The failure detection function is provided by delay timer <b>920</b> and SCR <b>922</b>. Delay timer <b>920</b> receives power from power supply <b>924</b>. When no fault condition is present, delay timer <b>920</b> is reset by the test acceptance signal during each negative half cycle preventing timer <b>920</b> from timing out. If there is an internal fault in GFI <b>900</b>, as previously described, the output signal on line <b>903</b> and associated test acceptance signal from winding <b>912</b> which normally recurs on each negative half cycle ceases, allowing delay timer <b>920</b> to time out.</p>
  <p num="p-0085">SCR <b>922</b> is turned on in response to a time out condition. SCR <b>922</b> activates solenoid <b>910</b> which in turn operates the trip mechanism <b>80</b> (<b>528</b>, <b>801</b>.) Subsequently, the four-pole interrupter contacts are released and the load-side terminals (<b>30</b>, <b>300</b>) and receptacle(s) <b>40</b> are decoupled from the power source of the electrical circuit. If a user attempts to reset the interrupting contacts by manually depressing the reset button <b>962</b>, the absence of test acceptance signal causes device <b>10</b> to trip out again. The internal fault condition can cause device <b>10</b> to trip, and can also be indicated visually or audibly using indicator <b>914</b>. Alternatively, solenoid <b>910</b> may be omitted, such that the internal fault condition is indicated visually or audibly using indicator <b>914</b>, but does not cause device <b>10</b> to trip. Thus the response mechanism may be a circuit interruption by mechanism <b>80</b> (<b>528</b>, <b>801</b>), an indication by indicator <b>914</b> or both in combination with each other.</p>
  <p num="p-0086">Checking circuit <b>901</b> is also susceptible to end of life failure conditions. Checking circuit <b>901</b> is configured such that those conditions either result in tripping of GFI <b>900</b>, including each time reset button <b>928</b> is depressed, or at least such that the failure does not interfere with the continuing ability of GFI <b>900</b> to sense, detect, and interrupt a true ground fault or grounded neutral condition. For example, if SCR <b>922</b> develops a short circuit, solenoid <b>910</b> is activated each time GFI <b>900</b> is reset and GFI <b>900</b> immediately trips out. If one or more of capacitor <b>918</b>, solenoid <b>910</b> or winding <b>912</b> malfunction, an acceptable test signal will not generated, and checking circuit <b>901</b> is configured to cause GFI <b>900</b> to trip out. If polarity detector <b>928</b> or switch <b>930</b> are shorted out, the grounded neutral simulation signal is enabled during both polarities of the AC power source. This will cause GFI <b>900</b> to trip out. If polarity detector <b>928</b> or switch <b>930</b> open circuit, there is absence of grounded neutral simulation signal, and delay timer <b>920</b> will not be reset and GFI <b>900</b> will trip out. Solenoids <b>52</b> and <b>910</b> are configured to operate trip mechanism <b>80</b> (<b>528</b>, <b>801</b>) even if one or the other has failed due to an end of life condition. Therefore if solenoid <b>910</b> shorts out, trip mechanism <b>80</b> is still actuatable by solenoid <b>52</b> during a true fault condition. If power supply <b>924</b> shorts out, power supply <b>902</b> still remains operational, such that GFI <b>900</b> remains operative.</p>
  <p num="p-0087">Although to the likelihood of occurrence is low, some double fault conditions cause GFI <b>900</b> to immediately trip out. By way of illustration, if SCR <b>922</b> and SCR <b>106</b> simultaneously short out, solenoids <b>52</b> and <b>910</b> are both turned on, resulting in activation of trip mechanism <b>80</b> (<b>528</b>, <b>801</b>.)</p>
  <p num="p-0088">In another embodiment, solenoid <b>910</b> may be omitted and SCR <b>922</b> re-connected as illustrated by dotted line <b>936</b>. During a true fault condition, solenoid <b>52</b> is turned on (activated) by SCR <b>106</b>; when an end of life condition in GFI <b>900</b> is detected by checking circuit <b>901</b>, solenoid <b>52</b> is turned on by SCR <b>922</b>. The possibility of a solenoid <b>52</b> failure is substantially minimized by connecting solenoid <b>52</b> to the load side of the interrupting contacts.</p>
  <p num="p-0089">As has been described, wire loop <b>934</b> includes a portion of the neutral conductor. A segment of the hot conductor can be included in electrical loop <b>934</b> instead of the neutral conductor to produce a similar simulation signal (not shown).</p>
  <p num="p-0090">Other modifications may be made as well. The neutral conductor (or hot) conductor portion has a resistance <b>964</b>, typically 1 to 10 milliohms, through which current through the load flows, producing a voltage drop. The voltage drop causes a current in electrical loop <b>934</b> to circulate which is sensed by differential sensor <b>100</b> as a ground fault. Consequently, ground fault detector <b>104</b> produces a signal on output <b>903</b> due to closure of test switch <b>930</b> irrespective of whether or not an internal fault condition has occurred in neutral transmitter <b>102</b>. In order to assure that grounded neutral transmitter <b>102</b> is tested for a fault by checking circuit <b>901</b>, electrical loop <b>934</b> can be configured as before but not to include a segment of the neutral (or hot) conductor, as illustrated by the wire segment, shown as dotted line <b>966</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0091">Device <b>10</b> may also be equipped with a miswiring detection circuit <b>520</b>, such as has been described. If device <b>10</b> has been correctly wired, resistor <b>522</b> fuses open. Thus, the miswire detection circuit will not be available to afford miswire protection if device <b>10</b> happens to be re-installed. However, the checking circuit <b>901</b> can be configured to provide miswiring protection to a re-installation. During the course of re-installation, the user depresses test button <b>50</b>′ to trip GFI <b>900</b>. If device <b>10</b> has been miswired, power supply <b>924</b>, connected to the load side of interrupting contacts, provides power to delay timer <b>920</b>. Power supply <b>902</b> is configured to the circuit interrupting contacts, such that when GFI <b>900</b> is tripped, power supply <b>902</b> does not receive power. Since GFI <b>900</b> is not powered and thus inoperative, test acceptance signal is not communicated by winding <b>912</b>. As a result, checking circuit <b>901</b> trips device <b>10</b>. Whenever the reset button is depressed, the trip mechanism is activated such that the interrupter contacts do not remain closed. Thus, the checking circuit <b>901</b> interprets a re-installation miswiring in a similar manner to an end-of-life condition. Device <b>10</b> can only be reset after having been wired correctly.</p>
  <p num="p-0092">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, an alternate schematic of the electrical device depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is disclosed. This embodiment includes an auto-test circuit with an end-of-life circuit. This design may be employed in conjunction with any of the embodiments discussed above. This circuit is similar to the circuit depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, and the end-of-life circuit/mechanism is similar to that shown above. Grounded neutral transmitter <b>102</b> includes a saturating core <b>1000</b> and a winding <b>1002</b> coupled to hot and neutral line terminals <b>200</b> and <b>20</b>, respectively. During a true grounded neutral fault condition, saturating core <b>1000</b> induces current spikes in the electrical loop <b>934</b>. Reversals in the magnetic field in core <b>1000</b> corresponded to the zero crossings in the AC power source. The reversals in the magnetic field generate current spikes. Current spikes occurring during the positive-transitioning zero crosses produce a signal during the positive half cycle portions of the AC power source. The signal is sensed as a differential signal by ground fault sensor <b>100</b>, and detected by ground fault detector <b>104</b>. Subsequently, GFI <b>900</b> is tripped.</p>
  <p num="p-0093">A simulated grounded neutral condition is enabled by polarity detector <b>928</b> and switch <b>930</b>. Polarity detector <b>928</b> closes switch <b>930</b> during the negative half cycle. Thus, the current spikes occur during the negative half cycle portions but not during the positive half cycle portions of the AC power source. As described above, the output of detector <b>104</b> (line <b>903</b>) during the negative half cycle portions of the AC power source are unable to turn on SCR <b>106</b>. However, the output signal is used by checking circuit <b>901</b> to determine whether or not an end of life condition has occurred.</p>
  <p num="p-0094">Switch <b>934</b> may be implemented using a MOSFET device, designated as MPF930 and manufactured by ON Semiconductor. In another embodiment, switch <b>934</b> may be monolithically integrated in the ground fault detector <b>104</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0095">In response to a true ground fault or grounded neutral condition, ground fault detector <b>900</b> produces an output signal <b>903</b> during the positive half cycle portions of AC power source. The signal turns on SCR <b>106</b> and redundant SCR <b>922</b> to activate solenoid <b>52</b>. Solenoid <b>52</b> causes trip mechanism <b>80</b> (<b>528</b>, <b>801</b>) to operate.</p>
  <p num="p-0096">When a simulated grounded neutral condition is introduced in the manner described above, a test acceptance signal is provided to delay timer <b>920</b> during the negative half cycle portions of the AC power source. Delay timer <b>920</b> includes a transistor <b>1006</b> that discharges capacitor <b>1008</b> when the test acceptance signal is received. Capacitor <b>1008</b> is recharged by power supply <b>902</b> by way of resistor <b>1010</b> during the remaining portion of the AC line cycle. Again, if there is an internal failure in device <b>10</b>, the test acceptance signal is not generated and transistor <b>1006</b> is not turned on. As a result, capacitor <b>1008</b> continues to charge until it reaches a predetermined voltage. At the predetermined voltage SCR <b>922</b> is activated during a positive half cycle portion of the AC power source signal. In response, solenoid <b>52</b> causes the trip mechanism <b>80</b> (<b>528</b>,<b>801</b>) to operate. Alternatively, SCR <b>922</b> can be connected to a second solenoid <b>910</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.)</p>
  <p num="p-0097">Both GFI <b>900</b> and checking circuit <b>901</b> derive power from power supply <b>902</b>. Redundant components can be added such that if one component has reached end of life, another component maintains the operability of GFI <b>900</b>, thereby enhancing reliability, or at least assuring the continuing operation of the checking circuit <b>901</b>. For example, the series pass element <b>1012</b> in power supply <b>902</b> may include parallel resistors. Resistor <b>1014</b> may be included to prevent the supply voltage from collapsing in the event the ground fault detector <b>104</b> shorts out. Clearly, if the supply voltage collapses, delay timer <b>920</b> may be prevented from signaling an end of life condition. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that there are a number of redundant components that can be included in device <b>10</b>, the present invention should not be construed as being limited to the foregoing example.</p>
  <p num="p-0098">Alternatively, SCR <b>922</b> may be connected to end-of-life resistors R<b>23</b>, R<b>24</b>, as have been described, as shown by dotted line <b>1016</b>, instead of being connected to solenoid <b>52</b> or <b>910</b>. When SCR <b>922</b> conducts, the value of resistors R<b>23</b>, R<b>24</b> is selected to generate an amount of heat in excess of the melting point of solder on its solder pads, or the melting point of a proximate adhesive. The value of resistors R<b>23</b>, R<b>24</b> are typically 1,000 ohms. Resistors R<b>23</b>, R<b>24</b> function as part of a thermally releasable mechanical barrier.</p>
  <p num="p-0099">Since end of life resistors R<b>23</b>, R<b>24</b> afford a permanent decoupling of the load side of device <b>10</b> from the AC power source, it is important that the end of life resistors R<b>23</b>, R<b>24</b> only dislodge when there is a true end of life condition and not due to other circumstances, such as transient electrical noise. For example, SCR <b>922</b> may experience self turn-on in response to a transient noise event. Coupling diode <b>1018</b> may be included to decouple resistors R<b>23</b>, R<b>24</b> in the event of a false end of life condition. Coupling diode <b>1018</b> causes SCR <b>922</b> to activate solenoid <b>52</b> when it is ON.</p>
  <p num="p-0100">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the present invention without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
