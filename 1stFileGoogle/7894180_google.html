    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0004">Portable notebook-type computers using a built-in battery pack power source are generally well-known and have an advantage in being handy to carry about and freely used even in those places which are not accessible to the commercial power supply.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">Such computers are compact in design for higher portability, so that their standard functions are inevitably more limited than those of desktop computers. Accordingly, such portable computers are generally provided with one or more connectors and ports for function expansion, usually on the rear face of its casing which supports a keyboard and a display unit. These computers are additionally furnished with new functions by connecting peripheral devices, such as a hard disk drive, mouse, printer, etc., to the connectors and ports.</p>
    <p num="p-0006"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> illustrate a notebook-type portable computer <b>1</b> for use as a portable electronic device which is connected to an external expanding apparatus, commonly referred to as a “docking station.” The computer <b>1</b> includes a plastic casing <b>2</b> serving as an apparatus body. The casing <b>2</b> is in the form of a flat generally rectangular box having a bottom face <b>2</b> <i>a </i>and a top face <b>2</b> <i>b</i>, which extend generally parallel to each other, and a front face <b>2</b> <i>c</i>, a rear face <b>2</b> <i>d</i>, and side faces <b>2</b> <i>e </i>and <b>2</b> <i>f</i>, which are continuous with the bottom and top faces <b>2</b> <i>a </i>and <b>2</b> <i>b</i>. At least one such computer casing <b>2</b> further includes a tongue <b>2</b> <i>g </i>projected from the front face <b>2</b> <i>c </i>and having a bottom face <b>2</b> <i>h </i>which may be continuous with the bottom face <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the casing <b>2</b>, a top face <b>2</b> <i>i </i>which extends generally parallel to the bottom face <b>2</b> <i>h</i>, and a front face <b>2</b> <i>j </i>that is spaced away from the casing front face <b>2</b> <i>c</i>. The tongue <b>2</b> <i>g </i>may include side surfaces <b>2</b> <i>k </i>and <b>2</b> <i>l </i>extending between the computer casing front surface <b>2</b> <i>c </i>and the tongue front face <b>2</b> <i>j</i>. Other surfaces of the casing <b>2</b>, such as one of the side faces <b>2</b> <i>e</i>, <b>2</b> <i>f </i>may includes additional features, such as but not limited to a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM <b>3</b> <i>a </i>and a main power switch <b>3</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0007">Arranged on the top face <b>2</b> <i>b </i>of the casing <b>2</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is a keyboard <b>7</b> which is used to input information and commands. A pair of display supporting portions <b>8</b> <i>a </i>and <b>8</b> <i>b</i>, left and right, are formed at the rear end portion of the top face <b>2</b> <i>b</i>. A flat display unit <b>9</b> having a thickness t is connected to the display supporting portions <b>8</b> <i>a </i>and <b>8</b> <i>b</i>. The display unit <b>9</b> is rotated about a hinge axis h on a pair of legs <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and <b>10</b> <i>b</i>, left and right, which are pivotally mounted on the supporting portions <b>8</b> <i>a </i>and <b>8</b> <i>b</i>, respectively, by means of hinge devices as is generally well-known. Thus, the display unit <b>9</b> is supported on the casing <b>2</b> to be rotatable about the hinge axis h relative to the casing <b>2</b> between a closed position, in which a display screen surface <b>9</b> <i>a </i>of the display unit <b>9</b> touches the top face <b>2</b> <i>b </i>of the casing <b>2</b>. The display unit <b>9</b> thereby covers the keyboard <b>7</b> for protecting both the keyboard <b>7</b> and display screen surface <b>9</b> <i>a </i>of the display unit <b>9</b> with a hard shell backing portion <b>9</b> <i>b </i>of the display unit <b>9</b>. The display unit <b>9</b> alternately rotates into an open position in which the display unit <b>9</b> stands upright with the display screen surface <b>9</b> <i>a </i>exposed at the back of the keyboard <b>7</b>, as illustrated. Furthermore, a hard shell lip portion <b>9</b> <i>c </i>of the display unit <b>9</b> surrounds the sensitive display screen <b>9</b> <i>d</i>, the display screen <b>9</b> <i>d </i>is slightly recessed below the hard shell lip portion <b>9</b> <i>c. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0008"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an input/output (I/O) connector or port <b>4</b> of the known portable computer being provided in the rear face <b>2</b> <i>d </i>between interface apertures <b>4</b> <i>a </i>and <b>4</b> <i>b </i>on either side thereof. The I/O connector <b>4</b> includes a quantity of pins or pin receptors (shown) <b>4</b> <i>c </i>are organized in a selected pattern. The pins or pin receptors <b>4</b> <i>c </i>provided input/output (I/O) capability for communicating with various peripheral components that may provide such functions as for example but not limited to: a modem, a game port, audio output, a microphone input, serial connections, parallel connections, a video display output, USB (Universal Serial Bus) connection, a mouse connection, a keyboard connection, an external power supply connection. Alternatively, connection to these or other peripheral devices are provided by a separate and individual modem connector, a game port, audio speaker connectors, a microphone connector, two serial connectors, a parallel connector, a display unit connector, a USB connector, a mouse connector, a keyboard connector, and an external power supply connector, as are generally well-known in the art. A metallic terminal plate <b>5</b> is exposed on the rear face <b>2</b> <i>d </i>and surrounds the I/O connector <b>4</b> and includes an open end of each of the apertures <b>4</b> <i>a </i>and <b>4</b> <i>b</i>. The apertures <b>4</b> <i>a </i>and <b>4</b> <i>b </i>each include a cylindrical aperture or a lengthwise slot (shown) or an aperture of another shape extending from the rear face <b>2</b> <i>d </i>of the casing <b>2</b> toward the opposite front face <b>2</b> <i>c. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0009">In transporting the computer <b>1</b> peripheral devices must be removed from their corresponding connectors or ports, or alternatively the single I/O connector <b>4</b>. In restoring the computer <b>1</b> to its original state after using it elsewhere, any peripheral devices must be connected again via the I/O connector <b>4</b>. In the case where a large number of peripheral devices are connected, therefore, the removal and connection require very troublesome operations.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">To cope with this, there have recently been provided external expanding apparatuses or “docking stations” which are adapted to be interposed between a portable computer and a plurality of peripheral devices and relay signals transferred between the computer and the devices.</p>
    <p num="p-0011"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates one such docking station <b>13</b> having a plurality of connectors and ports connectable with the peripheral devices, external power supply connector, etc., and an expansion connector <b>15</b> is presented at a connector presentation surface <b>21</b> which is opposed to the rear face <b>2</b> <i>d </i>of the computer casing <b>2</b>. The expansion connector <b>15</b> is structured to engage the computer's I/O connector <b>4</b>. The expansion connector <b>15</b> is mounted on a movable bracket <b>18</b> structured to engage apertures <b>4</b> <i>a </i>and <b>4</b> <i>b </i>on opposite sides of the I/O connector <b>4</b> as a prelude to the expansion connector <b>15</b> actually engaging the I/O connector <b>4</b>. By example and without limitation, the bracket <b>18</b> includes a pair of guide pins or arms <b>18</b> <i>a </i>and <b>18</b> <i>b </i>that are positioned on opposite sides of the expansion connector <b>15</b> to engage apertures <b>4</b> <i>a </i>and <b>4</b> <i>b </i>on opposite sides of the I/O connector <b>4</b>. The expansion connector <b>15</b> includes a quantity of pin receptors or pins (shown) <b>15</b> <i>a </i>organized in a selected pattern to engage the pins or pin receptors <b>4</b> <i>c </i>of the computer's I/O connector <b>4</b>. The pins <b>15</b> <i>a </i>of the expansion connector <b>15</b> are connected electrically to different ones of the connectors and ports that are connectable with the peripheral devices.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">In known prior art docking station devices <b>13</b> the pair of guide pins or arms <b>18</b> <i>a </i>and <b>18</b> <i>b </i>positioned on opposite sides of the expansion connector <b>15</b> are extended forward of the expansion connector <b>15</b> and its pin receptors or pins (shown) <b>15</b> <i>a </i>such that the guide arms <b>18</b> <i>a</i>, <b>18</b> <i>b </i>engage the apertures <b>4</b> <i>a </i>and <b>4</b> <i>b </i>on opposite sides of the I/O connector <b>4</b> before the expansion connector <b>15</b> and its pin receptors or pins <b>15</b> <i>a </i>the I/O connector <b>4</b>. Furthermore, the expansion connector <b>15</b> is typically loosely mounted on the bracket <b>18</b> with a little lateral play such that the expansion connector <b>15</b> is permitted to move relative to the bracket <b>18</b> and its pin receptors or pins (shown) <b>15</b> <i>a </i>wiggle or “float” into final mating positions with the respective pin receptors (or pins) <b>4</b> <i>c </i>of the I/O connector <b>4</b> after the guide arms <b>18</b> <i>a</i>, <b>18</b> <i>b </i>have established a nominal docking position. Thus, the guide arms <b>18</b> <i>a</i>, <b>18</b> <i>b </i>with the respective interface apertures <b>4</b> <i>a</i>, <b>4</b> <i>b </i>fine tunes the positioning of the pins (or pin receptors) <b>15</b> <i>a </i>of the expansion connector <b>15</b> relative to the pin receptors (or pins) <b>4</b> <i>c </i>of the computer's I/O connector <b>4</b> prior to final insertion.</p>
    <p num="p-0013">The docking station <b>13</b> also includes a mounting platform <b>17</b> on which the computer <b>1</b> is removably mounted. The mounting platform <b>17</b> is, for example, adjacent connector presentation surface <b>21</b>, and includes a bearing surface <b>19</b> on which the bottom face <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the computer casing <b>2</b> is placed. The docking station apparatus <b>13</b> also includes bullet-nosed engaging pins <b>23</b> <i>a </i>and <b>23</b> <i>b</i>, which are provided on the bearing surface <b>19</b> adjacent to the connector presentation surface <b>21</b>. The bottom face <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the computer casing <b>2</b> includes a pair of locating holes <b>6</b> <i>a </i>and <b>6</b> <i>b </i>situated adjacent to the rear face <b>2</b> <i>d </i>and the side faces <b>2</b> <i>e </i>and <b>2</b> <i>f </i>of the casing <b>2</b>. The locating holes <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, <b>6</b> <i>b </i>each include a cylindrical aperture extending from the bottom face <b>2</b> <i>a </i>toward the opposite top face <b>2</b> <i>b </i>and sized to accept the bullet-nosed engaging pins <b>23</b> <i>a</i>, <b>23</b> <i>b </i>on the bearing surface <b>19</b> of the docking station <b>13</b>. The locating holes <b>6</b> <i>a </i>and <b>6</b> <i>b </i>thus serve to locate the computer's I/O connector <b>4</b> relative to the expansion connector <b>15</b> on the presentation surface <b>21</b> of the docking station <b>13</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0014">In connecting the computer to the docking station <b>13</b>, the tongue <b>2</b> <i>g </i>of the computer casing <b>2</b> is fit into a mouth <b>25</b> of a mating receiver structure <b>27</b> adjacent to the bearing surface <b>19</b> opposite from and facing toward the connector presentation surface <b>21</b>. The computer casing <b>2</b> is rotated about the tongue <b>2</b> <i>g </i>with the bottom surface <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the casing <b>2</b> guided toward the bearing surface <b>19</b>. When the bottom surface <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the casing <b>2</b> is close to the bearing surface <b>19</b>, the mating locating holes <b>6</b> <i>a </i>and <b>6</b> <i>b </i>in the bottom surface <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the casing <b>2</b> engage the locating pins <b>23</b> <i>a</i>, <b>23</b> <i>b </i>of the docking station <b>13</b>, which positions the casing <b>2</b> relative to the docking station <b>13</b>, and in particular positions the I/O connector <b>4</b> relative to the docking station's expansion connector <b>15</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0015">Thereafter, the docking station's expansion connector <b>15</b> and the pair of guide pins or arms <b>18</b> <i>a</i>, <b>18</b> <i>b </i>on either side of the expansion connector <b>15</b> are moved together in the direction indicated by the arrow toward the rear face <b>2</b> <i>d </i>of the computer <b>1</b> in a manner such that the pair of guide pins or arms <b>18</b> <i>a</i>, <b>18</b> <i>b </i>are fitted individually in the recesses of the respective interface apertures <b>4</b> <i>a</i>, <b>4</b> <i>b </i>by operation of a swingable operating lever <b>29</b>. Such engagement of the guide arms <b>18</b> <i>a</i>, <b>18</b> <i>b </i>with the respective interface apertures <b>4</b> <i>a</i>, <b>4</b> <i>b </i>fine tunes the positioning of the pins (or pin receptors) <b>15</b> <i>a </i>of the expansion connector <b>15</b> relative to the pin receptors (or pins) <b>4</b> <i>c </i>of the computer's I/O connector <b>4</b>. Continued operation of the operating lever <b>29</b> continues movement of the expansion connector <b>15</b> toward the computer's I/O connector <b>4</b>, and engages the pins (or pin receptors) <b>15</b> <i>a </i>with the pin receptors (or pins) <b>4</b> <i>c </i>during final insertion.</p>
    <p num="p-0016">As a result, the expansion connector <b>15</b> of the docking station <b>13</b> is connected to the computer's I/O connector <b>4</b>. Additionally, the computer <b>1</b> cannot be removed from the docking station <b>13</b> because the guide pins or arms <b>18</b> <i>a</i>, <b>18</b> <i>b </i>engaging the interface apertures <b>4</b> <i>a</i>, <b>4</b> <i>b </i>conspire with the receiver structure <b>27</b> engaging the computer casing's tongue <b>2</b> <i>g</i>, and the locating pins <b>23</b> <i>a </i>and <b>23</b> <i>b </i>engaging the mating locating holes <b>6</b> <i>a </i>and <b>6</b> <i>b </i>in the bottom surface <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the computer casing <b>2</b> to secure the computer <b>1</b> relative to the docking station's connector presentation surface <b>21</b> and the bearing surface <b>19</b>, respectively.</p>
    <p num="p-0017">In removing the computer from the docking station apparatus <b>13</b>, the operating lever <b>29</b> is reversed to move the expansion connector <b>15</b> away from the computer rear surface <b>2</b> <i>d</i>, whereby the expansion connector <b>15</b> is disconnected from the computer's I/O connector <b>4</b>, and the guide pins or arms <b>18</b> <i>a</i>, <b>18</b> <i>b </i>are disengaged from the respective interface apertures <b>4</b> <i>a</i>, <b>4</b> <i>b</i>. The computer casing <b>2</b> can be rotated about the tongue <b>2</b> <i>g </i>so that the bottom surface <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the casing <b>2</b> is disengaged from the bearing surface <b>19</b>, and the computer <b>1</b> is disengaged from the docking station <b>13</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0018">In the docking station apparatus <b>13</b> described above, the pins (or pin receptors) <b>15</b> <i>a </i>of the expansion connector <b>15</b> are attached to a circuit board which is located within a casing <b>31</b> of the apparatus <b>13</b>, and the expansion connector <b>15</b> is connected to the circuit board through a flexible wiring harness. The flexible wiring board is in turn connected through other flexible wiring harnesses to separate and individual modem connector, a game port, audio speaker connectors, a microphone connector, two serial connectors, a parallel connector, a display unit connector, a USB connector, a mouse connector, a keyboard connector, and an external power supply connector, as are generally well-known in the art.</p>
    <p num="p-0019"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an input/output (I/O) plate <b>33</b> of the docking station <b>13</b> where the flexible wiring harnesses of external devices may be connected to, for example, a mouse connector <b>35</b>, a keyboard connector <b>37</b>, a display unit connector <b>39</b>, one or more serial connectors <b>41</b>, a game port <b>43</b>, a parallel connector <b>45</b>, a serial connector <b>47</b>, one or more USB connectors <b>49</b>, a microphone connector <b>51</b>, one or more speaker connectors <b>53</b>, an external power supply connector <b>55</b>, a modem connector <b>57</b>, or a power switch <b>59</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0020">However, known docking station apparatus are limited in their ability to provide the above expansion efficiently and reliably.</p>

    <p num="p-0087"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a front perspective view that illustrates the present invention embodied by example and without limitation as a novel external computer expanding apparatus or “docking station” <b>100</b> which is adapted to be interposed between a portable computer of the type illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> and a plurality of peripheral devices and relay signals transferred between the computer and the devices.</p>
    <p num="p-0088">The docking station <b>100</b> includes a two-piece body <b>102</b> having an upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a </i>connected to a lower body portion <b>102</b> <i>b </i>along a line <b>103</b> of mutual contact. The upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a </i>is formed with a bearing surface <b>104</b> on one face of a substantially rigid bearing plate <b>105</b>. The bearing surface <b>104</b> is structured for the computer casing <b>2</b> to be removably placed thereon. A connector presentation surface <b>106</b> is projected above the bearing surface <b>104</b> for presenting an expansion connector <b>108</b> to the rear face <b>2</b> <i>d </i>of the computer <b>1</b> when the computer's bottom face <b>2</b> <i>a </i>is placed on the bearing surface <b>104</b>. The upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a </i>also includes means for securing the computer <b>1</b> to the bearing surface <b>104</b> in fixed position relative to the connector presentation surface <b>106</b> such that a coupling with the expansion connector <b>108</b> is not interrupted unintentionally. By example and without limitation, the securing means includes a receiver structure <b>110</b> fixedly positioned adjacent to a front portion <b>111</b> of the bearing surface <b>104</b> opposite from the connector presentation surface <b>106</b> and having an open jaw structure <b>112</b> facing toward the connector presentation surface <b>106</b> and structured to receive and mate with the tongue <b>2</b> <i>g </i>on the front face of the computer casing <b>2</b>. Mating of the tongue <b>2</b> <i>g </i>within the open jaw <b>112</b> of the receiver structure <b>110</b> resists separation of the computer casing's bottom face <b>2</b> <i>a </i>from the bearing surface <b>104</b>. Such mating of the tongue <b>2</b> <i>g </i>within the jaw <b>112</b> of the receiver structure <b>110</b> also resists sliding of the computer casing <b>2</b> along the bearing surface <b>104</b> away from the connector presentation surface <b>106</b>. Additionally, the open jaw <b>112</b> may optionally include lips on either side thereof that engage side surfaces <b>2</b> <i>k </i>and <b>2</b> <i>l </i>(if present) of the tongue <b>2</b> <i>g</i>, and by such engagement, resist sideways slippage along the bearing surface <b>104</b> parallel of the connector presentation surface <b>106</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0089">The securing means also includes a pair of engaging pins <b>114</b> <i>a </i>and <b>114</b> <i>b </i>fixedly positioned on a rear portion <b>115</b> of the bearing surface <b>104</b> adjacent to the connector presentation surface <b>106</b>, the engaging pins <b>114</b> <i>a</i>, <b>114</b> <i>b </i>are structured to be slidingly received into the mating locating holes <b>6</b> <i>a </i>and <b>6</b> <i>b </i>in the bottom surface <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the casing <b>2</b>. The two engaging pins <b>114</b> <i>a </i>and <b>114</b> <i>b </i>operate to position the computer casing <b>2</b> relative to the docking station bearing surface <b>104</b>, and in particular to position the computer's I/O connector <b>4</b> relative to the docking station's expansion connector <b>108</b>. Such mating of the two engaging pins <b>114</b> <i>a</i>, <b>114</b> <i>b </i>within the respective locating holes <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, <b>6</b> <i>b </i>also serve to resist both lateral and longitudinal slippage of the computer casing <b>2</b> relative to the bearing surface <b>104</b>. The two engaging pins <b>114</b> <i>a</i>, <b>114</b> <i>b </i>resist both sliding of the computer casing <b>2</b> along the bearing surface <b>104</b> away from the connector presentation surface <b>106</b>, and simultaneously resist sideways slippage along the bearing surface <b>104</b> parallel of the connector presentation surface <b>106</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0090">The securing means also includes a pair of guides <b>116</b> <i>a </i>and <b>116</b> <i>b </i>provided as either substantially rigid pins or stiff arms that are positioned on opposite sides of the expansion connector <b>108</b>. The guides <b>116</b> <i>a </i>and <b>116</b> <i>b </i>extend past the expansion connector <b>108</b> and engage the apertures <b>4</b> <i>a </i>and <b>4</b> <i>b </i>on opposite sides of the computer's I/O connector <b>4</b> in advance of the expansion connector <b>108</b> engaging the computer's I/O connector <b>4</b>. As is discussed in detail below, by operation of a sliding expansion connector drive mechanism <b>118</b>, the expansion connector <b>108</b> simultaneously with the pair of guide pins or arms <b>116</b> <i>a</i>, <b>116</b> <i>b </i>(hereinafter “guide arms”) on either side of the expansion connector <b>108</b> are together moved inward from the presentation surface <b>106</b> (in the direction indicated by arrow <b>120</b>) across the bearing surface <b>104</b> toward the opposing open jaw <b>112</b> of the receiver structure <b>110</b> in a manner such that the pair of guide arms <b>116</b> <i>a</i>, <b>116</b> <i>b </i>are fitted individually in the recesses of the respective interface apertures <b>4</b> <i>a</i>, <b>4</b> <i>b </i>the rear face <b>2</b> <i>d </i>of the computer casing <b>2</b> in advance of connection of the connector <b>108</b> with the computer's I/O connector <b>4</b>. Such engagement of the guide arms <b>116</b> <i>a</i>, <b>116</b> <i>b </i>with the respective interface apertures <b>4</b> <i>a</i>, <b>4</b> <i>b </i>presses the pair of guide arms <b>116</b> <i>a</i>, <b>116</b> <i>b </i>against the respective interface apertures <b>4</b> <i>a</i>, <b>4</b> <i>b </i>in the rear face <b>2</b> <i>d </i>of the computer casing <b>2</b>, which in turn pushes the front face <b>2</b> <i>c </i>toward the receiver structure <b>110</b> and the tongue <b>2</b> <i>g </i>into its open jaw <b>112</b>. Additionally, the mating of the guide arms <b>116</b> <i>a</i>, <b>116</b> <i>b </i>within the respective computer casing interface apertures <b>4</b> <i>a</i>, <b>4</b> <i>b </i>resist sideways slippage along the bearing surface <b>104</b> parallel of the connector presentation surface <b>106</b>. More importantly, the mating of the guide arms <b>116</b> <i>a</i>, <b>116</b> <i>b </i>within the respective computer casing interface apertures <b>4</b> <i>a</i>, <b>4</b> <i>b </i>resists separation of the computer casing's bottom face <b>2</b> <i>a </i>from the bearing surface <b>104</b> so that the two engaging pins <b>114</b> <i>a</i>, <b>114</b> <i>b </i>within the respective locating holes <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, <b>6</b> <i>b </i>more effectively resist both lateral and longitudinal slippage of the computer casing <b>2</b> relative to the bearing surface <b>104</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0091">Furthermore, the expansion connector <b>108</b> includes a quantity of pin receptors or pins (shown) <b>122</b> organized in a selected pattern to engage the pins or pin receptors <b>4</b> <i>c </i>of the computer's I/O connector <b>4</b>. Accordingly, such engagement of the guide arms <b>116</b> <i>a</i>, <b>116</b> <i>b </i>on either side of the expansion connector <b>108</b> with the respective interface apertures <b>4</b> <i>a</i>, <b>4</b> <i>b </i>also fine tunes the positioning of pin receptors or pins (shown) <b>122</b> of the expansion connector <b>108</b> relative to the pin receptors (or pins) <b>4</b> <i>c </i>of the computer's I/O connector <b>4</b>, whereby operation of the expansion connector drive <b>118</b> causes the expansion connector <b>108</b> to engage the computer's I/O connector <b>4</b>, and engages the pins (or pin receptors) <b>122</b> with the pin receptors (or pins) <b>4</b> <i>c. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0092">Thus, the three-part computer securing means includes the receiver structure <b>110</b> fixed adjacent the front portion <b>111</b> of the bearing surface <b>104</b>, the engaging pins <b>114</b> <i>a </i>and <b>114</b> <i>b </i>fixed on the rear face <b>115</b> of the bearing surface <b>104</b>, and the guide arms <b>116</b> <i>a</i>, <b>116</b> <i>b </i>on either side of the expansion connector <b>108</b>, which operate together to retain the computer's I/O connector <b>4</b> on the rear face <b>2</b> <i>d </i>of the casing <b>2</b> in uninterrupted engagement with the docking station's expansion connector <b>108</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0093">However, the guide arms <b>116</b> <i>a</i>, <b>116</b> <i>b </i>on either side of the expansion connector <b>108</b> might interfere with seating the computer casing <b>2</b> against the bearing surface <b>104</b>, so a sensing means <b>123</b> is optionally provided for sensing that the computer's casing <b>2</b> is emplaced on the docking station's bearing surface <b>104</b> with its I/O connector <b>4</b> positioned to receive the docking station's expansion connector <b>108</b>. For example, the optional sensing means <b>123</b> may be provided in the form of safety catch <b>124</b> having a stem or button that cooperates with the expansion connector drive <b>118</b> to detect presence of the computer <b>1</b> against the bearing surface <b>104</b>. As discussed herein below, if present, the sensing means <b>123</b> is an optional safety mechanism that prevents the expansion connector drive <b>118</b> from being operated unless the computer casing <b>2</b> is firmly seated against the bearing surface <b>104</b> of the docking station upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a</i>, which depresses the safety catch <b>124</b>. Thus, the docking station <b>100</b> optionally senses the presence of the computer <b>1</b> when installation of the casing <b>2</b> causes depression of the safety catch <b>124</b>, if present. By requiring previous operation of the safety catch <b>124</b>, if present, the expansion connector <b>108</b> cannot be deployed until the computer's I/O connector <b>4</b> is positioned to receive it. Accordingly, neither the guide arms <b>116</b> <i>a</i>, <b>116</b> <i>b </i>nor the expansion connector <b>108</b> can interfere with seating the computer casing <b>2</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0094">Furthermore, while the computer casing <b>2</b> is being seated, the expansion connector <b>108</b> remains tucked safely away in a home position on the sidelines of the bearing surface <b>104</b>. For example, the expansion connector <b>108</b> is protected in a disengaged “safe” position within an integral housing portion <b>126</b> of the casing upper body <b>102</b> <i>a </i>positioned at the rear <b>115</b> of the bearing surface <b>104</b>, where the expansion connector <b>108</b> is out of harm's way during seating of the computer casing <b>2</b>. By example and without limitation, the housing <b>126</b> extends above the bearing surface <b>104</b> and is formed with a cavity <b>128</b> that is extended rearward of the bearing surface <b>104</b>. The cavity <b>128</b> is sized to hold the expansion connector <b>108</b> on a connector bracket <b>130</b> having guide arms <b>116</b> <i>a</i>, <b>116</b> <i>b </i>projected therefrom on either side of the expansion connector <b>108</b>. The bracket <b>130</b>, together with the expansion connector <b>108</b> and guide arms <b>116</b> <i>a</i>, <b>116</b> <i>b </i>on either side thereof, is movable (as indicated by arrow <b>120</b>) by operation of the expansion connector drive mechanism <b>118</b> out of the cavity <b>128</b> and inward of the bearing surface <b>104</b> through an opening <b>132</b> formed in the presentation surface <b>106</b> of the housing <b>126</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0095">The docking station <b>100</b> of the present invention optionally includes a locking latch mechanism <b>134</b> for constraining the expansion connector drive mechanism <b>118</b> relative to the upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a </i>of the docking station <b>100</b>. Accordingly, the locking latch mechanism <b>134</b> constrains the bracket <b>130</b> having the expansion connector <b>108</b> and guide arms <b>116</b> <i>a</i>, <b>116</b> <i>b </i>in a deployed position, the deployed position having the expansion connector <b>108</b> outside the cavity <b>128</b> and extended over the bearing surface <b>104</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0096">As a result, the expansion connector <b>108</b> of the docking station <b>100</b> is connected to the computer's I/O connector <b>4</b>. Additionally, the computer <b>1</b> cannot be removed from engagement with the docking station <b>100</b> because the guide arms <b>116</b> <i>a</i>, <b>116</b> <i>b </i>engaging the interface apertures <b>4</b> <i>a</i>, <b>4</b> <i>b </i>cooperate with the receiver structure <b>110</b> engaging the computer casing's tongue <b>2</b> <i>g</i>, and the locating pins <b>114</b> <i>a </i>and <b>114</b> <i>b </i>engaging the mating locating holes <b>6</b> <i>a </i>and <b>6</b> <i>b </i>in the bottom surface <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the computer casing <b>2</b> to secure the computer <b>1</b> relative to the connector presentation surface <b>106</b> and the bearing surface <b>104</b>, respectively, of the docking station apparatus <b>100</b>. The locking latch mechanism <b>134</b> ensures the expansion connector drive mechanism <b>118</b> cannot be dislodged so that the guide arms <b>116</b> <i>a</i>, <b>116</b> <i>b </i>continue to engage the interface apertures <b>4</b> <i>a</i>, <b>4</b> <i>b</i>, even if the expansion connector drive mechanism <b>118</b> is attempted to be dislodged, either accidentally or intentionally.</p>
    <p num="p-0097">In removing the computer from the docking station apparatus <b>100</b> of the invention, the expansion connector drive mechanism <b>118</b> is reversed to move the expansion connector <b>108</b> away from the computer rear surface <b>2</b> <i>d</i>, whereby the expansion connector <b>108</b> is disconnected from the computer's I/O connector <b>4</b>, and the guide arms <b>116</b> <i>a</i>, <b>116</b> <i>b </i>are disengaged from the respective interface apertures <b>4</b> <i>a</i>, <b>4</b> <i>b</i>. The computer casing <b>2</b> can be rotated about the tongue <b>2</b> <i>g </i>so that the bottom surface <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the casing <b>2</b> is disengaged from the bearing surface <b>104</b>, and the computer <b>1</b> is disengaged from the docking station <b>100</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0098">According to one embodiment of the docking station <b>100</b> of the invention, the expansion connector <b>108</b> is optionally loosely mounted on the bracket <b>130</b> with a little lateral play such that the expansion connector <b>108</b> is permitted to move relative to the bracket <b>130</b> and its pin receptors or pins (shown) <b>122</b> wiggle or “float” into final mating positions with the respective pin receptors (or pins) <b>4</b> <i>c </i>of the I/O connector <b>4</b> after the guide arms <b>116</b> <i>a</i>, <b>116</b> <i>b </i>have established a nominal docking position, as in the prior art. Thus, the guide arms <b>116</b> <i>a</i>, <b>116</b> <i>b </i>with the respective interface apertures <b>4</b> <i>a</i>, <b>4</b> <i>b </i>fine tunes the positioning of the pins (or pin receptors) <b>122</b> of the expansion connector <b>108</b> relative to the pin receptors (or pins) <b>4</b> <i>c </i>of the computer's I/O connector <b>4</b> prior to final insertion.</p>
    <p num="p-0099">Alternatively, the expansion connector <b>108</b> is optionally securely mounted on the bracket <b>130</b> without appreciable lateral play such that the expansion connector <b>108</b> is not permitted to move relative to the bracket <b>130</b> and its pin receptors or pins (shown) <b>15</b> <i>a </i>do not wiggle or float into final mating positions with the respective pin receptors (or pins) <b>4</b> <i>c </i>of the I/O connector <b>4</b>. Rather, as discussed herein below, the expansion connector drive mechanism <b>118</b> provides sufficient lateral play that, the guide arms <b>18</b> <i>a</i>, <b>18</b> <i>b </i>operate to establish both a nominal docking position and a final insertion position of the expansion connector <b>108</b> relative to the computer's I/O connector <b>4</b>. Thus, the complexity of the prior art bracket <b>18</b>, as discussed herein above, is eliminated, while the positioning function is maintained as a feature of the expansion connector drive mechanism <b>118</b> of the invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0100">Optionally, hand clearances <b>137</b> communicate with either side of the docking station's computer bearing surface <b>104</b> for access to the bottom surface <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the computer <b>1</b> for lifting it free of the bearing surface <b>104</b> and the guide pins <b>114</b> <i>a</i>, <b>114</b> <i>b </i>projected therefrom. By example and without limitation, the hand clearances <b>137</b> are provided as indentations in the upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a </i>and optionally in the lower body portion <b>102</b> <i>b </i>as well.

For example, the follower mechanism or slot <b>206</b> fits with sufficient play on the guides <b>228</b> that the frame <b>204</b> is permitted sufficient lateral play along arrow <b>241</b> that lateral play the connector seat <b>208</b> permits the expansion connector <b>108</b> securely mounted thereon to move laterally relative to the bearing surface <b>104</b> of the upper body portion's bearing plate <b>105</b>. Thus, although is securely mounted on the bracket <b>130</b> without appreciable lateral play, the connector seat <b>208</b> actually has sufficient lateral play through the expansion connector drive mechanism <b>118</b> of the invention to establish both a nominal docking position of the expansion connector <b>108</b> relative to the computer's I/O connector <b>4</b> and a final insertion position of the pin receptors or pins (shown) <b>122</b> relative to the I/O connector's pin receptors (or pins) <b>4</b> <i>c</i>. Thus, the complexity of the prior art bracket <b>18</b>, as discussed herein above, is eliminated, while the positioning function is maintained as a feature of the expansion connector drive mechanism <b>118</b> of the invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0128">An integral catch mechanism <b>212</b> and integral handle <b>214</b> are both positioned adjacent to a second proximal or near end <b>216</b> of the frame <b>204</b> opposite from the connector seat <b>208</b>. The handle <b>214</b> may be provided, by example and without limitation, on one side <b>218</b> of the frame <b>204</b>, while the catch mechanism <b>212</b> may be provided, by example and without limitation, at the near end <b>216</b>. The catch mechanism <b>212</b> is structured to cooperate with the locking latch mechanism <b>134</b> for securely fixing the expansion connector drive mechanism <b>118</b> relative to the upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a </i>of the docking station <b>100</b> with the bracket <b>130</b> holding the expansion connector <b>108</b> and guide arms <b>116</b> <i>a</i>, <b>116</b> <i>b </i>on either side thereof in a deployed position, i.e., with the expansion connector <b>108</b> outside the cavity <b>128</b> and extended over the bearing surface <b>104</b>. By example and without limitation, the frame's integral catch mechanism <b>212</b> includes a lip portion <b>242</b> of the that engages either the optional lock mechanism <b>134</b>, or an alternative non-locking latch mechanism <b>244</b> (shown here), which is optionally substituted.</p>
    <p num="p-0129">As illustrated here, the alternative non-locking latch mechanism <b>244</b> is substituted for the optional locking latch mechanism <b>134</b>. The alternative non-locking latch mechanism <b>244</b> similarly constrains the expansion connector <b>108</b> to remain in the deployed position, as described herein. By example and without limitation, the alternative non-locking latch <b>244</b> is a flexible latch mechanism of the type illustrated in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/064,777 filed in the name of the inventor of the present invention on Feb. 23, 2005, which is incorporated herein in its entirety. Alternatively, when present, the optional locking mechanism <b>134</b> lockingly secures the expansion connector <b>108</b> in the deployed position.</p>
    <p num="p-0130">The sensing means <b>123</b> is provided as a security mechanism <b>220</b> that is structured to cooperate with the safety catch <b>124</b> to resist deployment of the expansion connector <b>108</b> until the computer <b>1</b> is seated against the bearing surface <b>104</b> and the computer's I/O connector <b>4</b> is positioned to receive the expansion connector <b>108</b>. By example and without limitation, the security mechanism <b>220</b> is provided in an integral security plate <b>221</b> formed, by example and without limitation, along the side <b>218</b> of the frame <b>204</b> and spaced away from the lengthwise inner slot <b>206</b>, for example, between the connector seat <b>208</b> and the handle <b>214</b>. The security mechanism <b>220</b> is provided as a keyhole <b>222</b> formed in the security plate <b>221</b>, the keyhole <b>222</b> being structured for cooperating with the safety catch <b>124</b> such that, when the safety catch <b>124</b> is engaged with the keyhole <b>222</b>, the frame <b>204</b> cannot be moved relative to the casing's upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a</i>. Furthermore, when the safety catch <b>124</b> is disengaged from the cooperating keyhole <b>222</b> in the security plate <b>221</b>, the frame <b>204</b> is free to move along the longitudinal axis L.</p>
    <p num="p-0131">The novel expansion connector drive mechanism <b>118</b> is operated by first depressing the safety catch <b>124</b> relative to the bearing surface <b>104</b> of the upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a</i>, for example by seating the bottom face <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the computer casing <b>2</b> against the bearing surface <b>104</b>. Depressing the safety catch <b>124</b> simultaneously disengages the safety catch <b>124</b> of the security mechanism <b>220</b> from the cooperating keyhole portion <b>222</b> in the security plate <b>221</b>, which thereby permits the frame <b>204</b> to move along the frame drive axis DA. The handle <b>214</b> of the expansion connector drive mechanism <b>118</b> is pulled along the drive axis DA toward the front face <b>172</b> of the casing's upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a</i>, which in turn pulls the expansion connector <b>108</b> and the guide arms <b>116</b> <i>a</i>, <b>116</b> <i>b </i>on either side thereof into the deployed position described herein, i.e., with the expansion connector <b>108</b> outside the cavity <b>128</b> and extended over the bearing surface <b>104</b>. The lip portion <b>242</b> of the frame's integral catch mechanism <b>212</b> engages either the optional lock mechanism <b>134</b>, or alternative non-locking latch mechanism <b>244</b> (shown here), which constrains the expansion connector drive mechanism <b>118</b> in the deployed position.</p>
    <p num="p-0132">An optional retraction mechanism <b>246</b> is operated for retracting the expansion connector <b>108</b> from the deployed position by driving the frame <b>204</b> along the drive axis DA away from the upper body portion's front face <b>172</b> toward its rear face <b>248</b>. By example and without limitation, the retraction mechanism <b>246</b> includes a resilient biasing mechanism <b>250</b>, such as a tension spring (shown), that is coupled between the rear face <b>248</b> of the upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a </i>and the second or near end <b>216</b> of the frame <b>204</b> adjacent to the handle <b>214</b>. The biasing mechanism <b>250</b> operates between the rear face <b>248</b> and the near end <b>216</b> of the frame <b>204</b> for pulling the frame <b>204</b> toward the rear face <b>248</b>. The biasing mechanism <b>250</b> thereby operates to automatically retract the expansion connector <b>108</b> from the deployed position when the locking latch mechanism <b>134</b> or non-locking latch mechanism <b>244</b> (shown here) is operated to release the frame's integral catch mechanism <b>212</b>. Alternatively, as illustrated, the spring <b>250</b> is coupled between a stanchion <b>251</b> near the rear face <b>248</b> and the near end <b>216</b> of the frame <b>204</b> for retracting the expansion connector <b>108</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0133">Furthermore, the resilient biasing mechanism or tension spring <b>250</b> being mounted on one side <b>218</b> of the frame <b>204</b> offset of the drive axis DA provides leverage to the force applied by the spring <b>250</b>. Therefore, the spring <b>250</b> also biases the frame <b>204</b> on the guides <b>228</b> relative to the upper body portion's inner surface <b>224</b> crosswise of the drive axis DA. Accordingly, the spring <b>250</b> also pulls the inner slot <b>206</b> of the frame <b>204</b> against the guides <b>228</b> so that the connector seat <b>208</b> and the expansion connector <b>108</b> securely mounted thereon are biased laterally relative to the upper body portion's inner surface <b>224</b> and the bearing surface <b>104</b> on the opposite surface of the bearing plate <b>105</b> and substantially crosswise of the drive axis DA. The lateral bias provided by the offset biasing mechanism <b>250</b> stabilizes the expansion connector <b>108</b> relative to the computer's I/O connector <b>4</b> for reducing effects on the interconnection of shocks and vibrations experienced by the docking station <b>100</b>. The novel expansion connector drive mechanism <b>118</b> of the invention thus further improves the interconnection of expansion connector <b>108</b> with the computer's I/O connector <b>4</b> over the prior art docking station's expansion connector <b>15</b>, as discussed above.</p>
    <p num="p-0134">As disclosed herein, the safety catch <b>124</b> will not interfere with the retraction mechanism <b>246</b> retracting the frame <b>204</b>. However, another biasing mechanism <b>252</b> (shown in subsequent figures) operates to reset the sensing means for sensing that the computer's casing <b>2</b> is emplaced on the docking station's bearing surface <b>104</b> before the expansion connector drive <b>118</b> can be operated.</p>
    <p num="p-0135"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates the alternative non-locking latch mechanism <b>244</b> by example and without limitation as a flexible latch mechanism of the type illustrated in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/064,777, which is incorporated herein in its entirety, for latching the expansion connector <b>108</b> in the deployed position. As illustrated here by example and without limitation the alternative non-locking latch mechanism <b>244</b> includes a tooth <b>254</b> positioned at one end of a flexible arm <b>256</b> that is integrally (shown) or separately attached at its opposite end to the upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a</i>, such as to the front face <b>172</b> thereof. Inclined surfaces <b>257</b> and <b>258</b> cooperate to allow the to tooth <b>254</b> to automatically engage the lip portion <b>242</b> of the frame's integral catch mechanism <b>212</b> when the frame <b>204</b> is moved into the position for deploying the expansion connector <b>108</b>, i.e., when the near end <b>216</b> of the frame <b>204</b> is pulled close to the front face <b>172</b> of the upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a</i>. A handle <b>260</b> is provided on the flexible arm <b>256</b> or another part of the alternative non-locking latch mechanism <b>244</b> for disengaging the tooth <b>254</b> from the frame's lip portion <b>242</b>, which releases the frame <b>204</b> for retracting the expansion connector <b>108</b> from the deployed position.</p>
    <p num="p-0136"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates the guide mechanism <b>226</b> that cooperates with the inner slot <b>206</b> to guide the frame <b>204</b> substantially along the drive axis DA. As discussed above, the frame <b>204</b> is constrained to move along the two guides <b>228</b> relative to the upper body portion's inner surface <b>224</b> along the drive axis DA. Here, by example and without limitation one or more keepers <b>240</b> are secured to the upper body portion's inner surface <b>224</b> by one or more fasteners <b>236</b> for constraining the frame <b>204</b> to move along the drive axis DA. The one or more keepers <b>240</b> also operate to constrain the guide discs <b>228</b>, when present, in a position for cooperating with the inner slot <b>206</b> of the frame <b>204</b>. Other structures for the guide mechanism <b>226</b> are also contemplated and may be substituted without deviating from the scope and intent of the present invention. For example, the one or more keepers <b>240</b> are provided by a pair of disk-shaped keepers, i.e., flat washers, that are secured to the upper body portion's inner surface <b>224</b> by the fasteners <b>236</b> for constraining the frame <b>204</b> to move along the drive axis DA.</p>

    <p num="p-0139"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a section view taken substantially along a drive axis DA of the expansion connector drive mechanism <b>118</b>.

By example and without limitation, the two guides <b>228</b> are illustrated here as wheels or rollers that rotate about respective axles or hubs <b>232</b> provided on the upper body portion's inner surface <b>224</b>. The frame <b>204</b> is constrained to move relative to the upper body portion's inner surface <b>224</b> along the drive axis DA by a single one-piece keeper <b>240</b> that is held in place by the two fasteners <b>236</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0140">As illustrated here the optionally lock mechanism <b>134</b> constrains the expansion connector <b>108</b> to remain in the deployed position, as described herein.</p>

A key <b>268</b> is applied to a key hole <b>270</b> in the lock cylinder <b>264</b> for disengaging the tooth <b>262</b> from the frame's lip portion <b>242</b>, which releases the frame <b>204</b> for retracting the expansion connector <b>108</b> from the deployed position.</p>
    <p num="p-0142"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> illustrates the docking station <b>100</b> being in an initial state of readiness to accept the computer <b>1</b> (shown in phantom) with the bottom face <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the casing <b>2</b> spaced away from the docking station's bearing surface <b>104</b>. Here, the expansion connector <b>108</b> is mounted on the connector seat <b>208</b> at the far end <b>210</b> of the frame <b>204</b>, and the expansion connector <b>108</b> along with the two guide pins or arms <b>116</b> <i>a</i>, <b>116</b> <i>b </i>that are positioned on opposite sides thereof are fully retracted within the cavity portion <b>128</b> of the housing <b>126</b> adjacent to the bearing surface <b>104</b> at the rear face <b>248</b> of the upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0143">As discussed herein, when the safety catch <b>124</b> of the optional sensing mechanism <b>123</b> is engaged with the keyhole <b>222</b> in the security plate <b>221</b>, as shown, the frame <b>204</b> cannot be moved relative to the casing's upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a </i>and the bearing surface <b>104</b>. Furthermore, the expansion connector <b>108</b> and guide pins or arms <b>116</b> <i>a</i>, <b>116</b> <i>b </i>are likewise cannot be moved out of the cavity <b>128</b> to interfere with seating the computer <b>1</b>. For example, a stem portion <b>272</b> of the safety catch <b>124</b> projects above the bearing surface <b>104</b> where the computer <b>1</b> is to be seated. The stem <b>272</b> is sized to pass through both a narrow elongated slot portion <b>274</b> at a distal end of the keyhole <b>222</b>, and a clearance passage <b>276</b> through the bearing surface <b>104</b>. Furthermore, the stem portion <b>272</b> is cooperatively sized with the narrow slot portion <b>274</b> to slide freely along a substantial length thereof, which thus permits the frame <b>204</b> to move between the fully retracted position (shown here) and the fully deployed position (shown in subsequent figures). The stem portion <b>272</b> of the safety catch <b>124</b> extends from a base portion <b>278</b> having a shoulder <b>280</b> that is oversized relative to the passage <b>276</b> so that the upper body portion's inner surface <b>224</b> on the backside of the bearing surface <b>104</b> operates as a stop for the safety catch <b>124</b>. Furthermore, the base portion <b>278</b> of the safety catch <b>124</b> is too large to pass through the narrow slot portion <b>274</b> of the keyhole <b>222</b>. However, the keyhole <b>222</b> includes an enlarged passage <b>282</b> that communicates with a near end <b>284</b> of the slot portion <b>274</b> and is sized to pass the base portion <b>278</b> of the safety catch <b>124</b>. As discussed herein, the safety catch <b>124</b> is structured to cooperate with the biasing mechanism <b>252</b> that operates to reset the sensing means for sensing that the computer's casing <b>2</b> is emplaced on the docking station's bearing surface <b>104</b> before the expansion connector drive <b>118</b> can be operated. By example and without limitation, when the biasing mechanism <b>252</b> is a conventional compression spring, as illustrated here, the base portion <b>278</b> of the safety catch <b>124</b> is structured with a cavity or pocket <b>286</b> that is sized to admit a first end portion <b>288</b> of the spring <b>252</b> and orient the spring <b>252</b> along a drive axis DS of the safety catch <b>124</b> that is by example and without limitation oriented substantially perpendicular to the bearing surface <b>104</b> of the upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a</i>. A second end portion <b>290</b> of the spring <b>252</b> is compressed against the inner surface <b>253</b> of the lower body portion <b>102</b> <i>b </i>(omitted here for clarity). Accordingly, the spring <b>252</b> operates against the inner surface <b>253</b> of the lower body portion <b>102</b> <i>b </i>to drive the safety catch <b>124</b> through the security plate <b>221</b> and the passage <b>276</b> to project from the bearing surface <b>104</b>.

    <p num="p-0149">When present, the locking latch mechanism <b>134</b> is released by application of the key <b>268</b> to the key hole <b>270</b> and subsequent operation thereof. Else, the alternative non-locking latch mechanism <b>244</b> is operated by application of pressure against the latch handle <b>260</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0150">Upon release of either the locking latch mechanism <b>134</b> or non-locking latch mechanism <b>244</b>, the retraction mechanism <b>246</b>, for example the tension spring shown, automatically retracts the expansion connector drive mechanism <b>118</b> from its deployed position along with the expansion connector <b>108</b>. As illustrated by example and without limitation, the frame <b>204</b> is automatically retracted from the deployed position adjacent to the front face <b>172</b> of the upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a </i>toward the retracted position adjacent to the rear face <b>248</b>. The guide mechanism <b>226</b> cooperates with the inner slot <b>206</b> to guide the frame <b>204</b> toward the retracted position substantially along the drive axis DA. Retraction of the frame <b>204</b> simultaneously retracts the expansion connector <b>108</b> seated thereon from the computer <b>1</b> and into the safe position within the cavity <b>128</b> of the integral housing portion <b>126</b> of the casing upper body <b>102</b> <i>a </i>adjacent the rear <b>115</b> of the bearing surface <b>104</b>, where the expansion connector <b>108</b> is out of harm's way during removal of the computer <b>1</b>, as illustrated and discussed herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0151"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> illustrates the docking station <b>100</b> being in final state of accepting the computer <b>1</b> (removed for clarity). Furthermore, the expansion connector <b>108</b> mounted on the connector seat <b>208</b> is positioned to engage the computer's I/O connector <b>4</b>, as discussed herein. Here, the expansion connector <b>108</b> and the two guide pins or arms <b>116</b> <i>a</i>, <b>116</b> <i>b </i>on opposite sides thereof are shown as being deployed out of the cavity portion <b>128</b> of the housing <b>126</b> of the upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a </i>by operation of the expansion connector drive <b>118</b>, as discussed herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0152">As discussed herein, when the bottom face <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the casing <b>2</b> is seated against the docking station's bearing surface <b>104</b>, as shown in previous figures, the compression spring of the biasing mechanism <b>252</b> is compressed against the inner surface <b>253</b> of the lower body portion <b>102</b> <i>b</i>. By example and without limitation, a cavity or pocket <b>292</b> is provided on the inner surface <b>253</b> of the lower body portion <b>102</b> <i>b</i>, the pocket <b>292</b> being sized to admit the second end portion <b>290</b> of the spring <b>252</b> opposite from the pocket <b>286</b> in the safety catch base portion <b>278</b>, and being structured to cooperate with the pocket <b>286</b> in the safety catch base portion <b>278</b> for orienting the spring <b>252</b> along the drive axis DS of the safety catch <b>124</b>. The spring <b>252</b> is thus compressed between the two pockets <b>286</b> and <b>292</b> for driving the safety catch <b>124</b> through the security plate <b>221</b> and the passage <b>276</b> to project from the bearing surface <b>104</b>. Thus, the spring <b>252</b> operates to set the docking station's computer sensing means <b>123</b> for securing the expansion connector <b>108</b> against inadvertent deployment.</p>
    <p num="p-0153"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> are respective top and bottom perspective views that together illustrate one embodiment of the frame <b>204</b> portion of the expansion connector drive <b>118</b> of the invention. Here, the single-piece elongated frame <b>204</b> is illustrated having the elongated lengthwise inner slot <b>206</b> extending nearly the entire length thereof substantially along the longitudinal axis L thereof. The integral expanded connector seat <b>208</b> is positioned at the first distal or far end <b>210</b> for mounting the expansion connector <b>108</b> thereon, and includes a pattern of several mounting holes <b>294</b> for attaching the expansion connector <b>108</b>. The integral catch mechanism <b>212</b> and integral handle <b>214</b> portions are both positioned adjacent to the second proximal or near end <b>216</b> of the frame <b>204</b> opposite from the connector seat <b>208</b>. The handle <b>214</b> may be provided, by example and without limitation, on one side <b>218</b> of the frame <b>204</b>, while the catch mechanism <b>212</b> may be provided, by example and without limitation, at the near end <b>216</b>. As discussed herein, the catch mechanism <b>212</b> includes the lip portion <b>242</b> that is structured to cooperate with either the locking latch mechanism <b>134</b> or alternative non-locking latch mechanism <b>244</b> for securely fixing the expansion connector drive mechanism <b>118</b> relative to the upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a </i>of the docking station <b>100</b> with the expansion connector <b>108</b> in a deployed position. As illustrated here by example and without limitation the lip portion <b>242</b> is integrally formed with the inclined surface <b>258</b> that cooperates with the inclined surface <b>257</b> of the latch mechanism's tooth <b>254</b> for helping the to tooth <b>254</b> to automatically engage the lip portion <b>242</b> when the frame <b>204</b> is moved into the position for deploying the expansion connector <b>108</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0154">The inclined surface <b>258</b> of the lip portion <b>242</b> similarly cooperates with the inclined surface <b>266</b> of the retractable tooth <b>262</b> of the optional lock mechanism <b>134</b>, when present. The inclined surface <b>258</b> similarly helps the to tooth <b>262</b> to automatically engage the lip portion <b>242</b> when the frame <b>204</b> is moved into the position for deploying the expansion connector <b>108</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0155">The security mechanism <b>220</b> is structured to cooperate with the safety catch <b>124</b> to resist deployment of the expansion connector <b>108</b> until the computer <b>1</b> is seated against the bearing surface <b>104</b>. Accordingly, the frame <b>204</b> includes the integral security plate <b>221</b> formed along the side <b>218</b> thereof and spaced away from the lengthwise inner slot <b>206</b> between the connector seat <b>208</b> and the handle <b>214</b>. The keyhole <b>222</b> is formed in the security plate <b>221</b> with the narrow slot portion <b>274</b> formed substantially parallel with the longitudinal axis L and having the enlarged passage <b>282</b> communicating with the proximal or near end <b>284</b> thereof.</p>
    <p num="p-0156">The second proximal or near end <b>216</b> of the frame <b>204</b> includes means for coupling the resilient biasing mechanism <b>250</b> for retracting the expansion connector <b>108</b> from the deployed position along the drive axis DA. By example and without limitation, the second proximal or near end <b>216</b> of the frame <b>204</b> includes a simple clearance hole <b>298</b> for coupling the biasing mechanism <b>250</b>, i.e., spring <b>252</b>, between it and the rear face <b>248</b> of the upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a</i>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. The resilient biasing mechanism <b>250</b> thus operates between the upper body portion's rear face <b>248</b> and the near end <b>216</b> of the frame <b>204</b> for retracting the expansion connector drive <b>118</b> from the deployed position when the locking latch mechanism <b>134</b> or alternative non-locking latch mechanism <b>244</b> is operated to release the frame's integral catch mechanism <b>212</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0157"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> is perspective view inside the upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a </i>and illustrates the expansion connector drive mechanism <b>118</b> of the present invention having a simplified single-piece elongated frame <b>304</b> having an elongated lengthwise inner slot <b>306</b> extending nearly the entire length of the frame <b>304</b> substantially along a longitudinal axis LA thereof. An integral expanded connector seat <b>308</b> is positioned at a first distal or far end <b>310</b> of the frame <b>304</b> for mounting the expansion connector <b>108</b> thereon. An integral catch mechanism <b>312</b> and integral handle portion <b>314</b> are both positioned adjacent to a second proximal or near end <b>316</b> of the frame <b>304</b> opposite from the connector seat <b>308</b>. The handle <b>314</b> may be provided, by example and without limitation, on an arm <b>317</b> extended from one side <b>318</b> of the frame <b>304</b>, while the catch mechanism <b>312</b> may be provided, by example and without limitation, at the near end <b>316</b>. The catch mechanism <b>312</b> is structured to cooperate with either the locking latch mechanism <b>134</b> or alternative non-locking latch mechanism <b>244</b> for constraining the expansion connector <b>108</b> to remain in the deployed position, as described herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0158">The lengthwise slot <b>306</b> in the alternate frame <b>304</b> cooperates with the guide mechanism <b>226</b> on the inner surface <b>224</b> of the upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a </i>opposite from the bearing surface <b>104</b> for guiding the frame <b>304</b> substantially along the drive axis DA, as described herein. By example and without limitation, lengthwise slot <b>306</b> cooperates with the two guides <b>228</b> of the guide mechanism <b>226</b> that are arranged on the upper body portion's inner surface <b>224</b> in spaced apart positions along the drive axis DA. By example and without limitation, the two guides <b>228</b> are optionally provided as one or more slides that permit the frame <b>304</b> to slide freely along the drive axis DA. Alternatively, the guides <b>228</b> are optionally formed as wheels or rollers that rotate about respective axles or hubs <b>232</b> provided on the upper body portion's inner surface <b>224</b>. The axles or hubs <b>232</b> may be configured to space the guides <b>228</b> slightly away from the upper body portion's inner surface <b>224</b> for easier rotation. The frame <b>304</b> is constrained to move relative to the upper body portion's inner surface <b>224</b> along the drive axis DA by one or more keepers <b>240</b> (shown in phantom). For example, a pair of disc-shaped keepers <b>240</b> are secured to the upper body portion's inner surface <b>224</b> by one or more fasteners <b>236</b> for constraining the frame <b>304</b> to move along the drive axis DA. The one or more keepers <b>240</b> also operate to constrain the guide wheels <b>228</b>, when present, in a position for cooperating with the inner slot <b>306</b> of the frame <b>304</b>. Other structures for the guide mechanism <b>226</b> are also contemplated and may be substituted without deviating from the scope and intent of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0159">The alternate frame <b>304</b> is structured such that, when the expansion connector <b>108</b> is mounted on the connector seat <b>308</b> at the far end <b>310</b> of the frame <b>304</b>, it fits within the cavity portion <b>128</b> of the housing <b>126</b> and extends above the bearing surface <b>104</b> of the upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a</i>. The alternate frame <b>304</b> is moveable, either by sliding or rolling, in cooperation with the guide mechanism <b>226</b> across the inner surface <b>224</b> of the upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a </i>and along the drive axis DA.</p>
    <p num="p-0160">A security mechanism <b>320</b> is structured to cooperate with the safety catch <b>124</b> to resist deployment of the expansion connector <b>108</b> until the computer <b>1</b> is seated against the bearing surface <b>104</b> and the computer's I/O connector <b>4</b> is positioned to receive the expansion connector <b>108</b>. Similar to the security mechanism <b>220</b> of the frame <b>204</b> discussed herein, by example and without limitation, the security mechanism <b>320</b> of the alternate frame <b>304</b> is provided in an integral security plate <b>321</b> formed, by example and without limitation, along the side <b>318</b> of the frame <b>304</b> and spaced away from the lengthwise inner slot <b>306</b>, for example, between the connector seat <b>308</b> and the handle <b>314</b>. The security mechanism <b>320</b> is provided as a keyhole <b>322</b> formed in the security plate <b>321</b>, the keyhole <b>322</b> being structured for cooperating with the safety catch <b>124</b> such that, when the safety catch <b>124</b> is engaged with the keyhole <b>322</b>, the frame <b>304</b> cannot be moved relative to the casing's upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a</i>. For example, the keyhole <b>322</b> includes at a distal end thereof a narrow slot portion <b>324</b> sized to freely move the stem portion <b>272</b> of the safety catch <b>124</b> along a substantial length thereof so that the frame <b>304</b> is permitted to move between the fully retracted position (shown here) and the fully deployed position (shown in previous figures). The keyhole <b>322</b> also includes an enlarged passage <b>326</b> that communicates with a near end <b>328</b> of the slot portion <b>324</b> and is sized to pass the base portion <b>278</b> of the safety catch <b>124</b> for disarming the safety catch <b>124</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0161">Similar to the novel expansion connector drive mechanism <b>118</b> operated with the frame <b>204</b>, here the novel expansion connector drive mechanism <b>118</b> of the invention is operated by first depressing the safety catch <b>124</b> relative to the bearing surface <b>104</b> of the upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a</i>, for example by seating the bottom face <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the computer casing <b>2</b> against the bearing surface <b>104</b>. Depressing the safety catch <b>124</b> simultaneously disengages the safety catch <b>124</b> of the security mechanism <b>320</b> from the cooperating keyhole portion <b>322</b> in the security plate <b>321</b>, which thereby permits the frame <b>304</b> to move along the frame drive axis DA. The handle <b>314</b> of the expansion connector drive mechanism <b>118</b> is pulled parallel to the drive axis DA toward the front face <b>172</b> of the casing's upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a</i>, which in turn pulls the expansion connector <b>108</b> and guide arms <b>116</b> <i>a</i>, <b>116</b> <i>b </i>on either side thereof into the deployed position described herein, i.e., the expansion connector <b>108</b> outside the cavity <b>128</b> and extended over the bearing surface <b>104</b>. A integral lip portion <b>330</b> of the frame's integral catch mechanism <b>312</b> engages either the locking latch mechanism <b>134</b> (shown) or the alternative non-locking latch mechanism <b>244</b> provided on the upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a</i>. The locking latch mechanism <b>134</b> (shown) or alternative non-locking latch mechanism <b>244</b> constrains the expansion connector <b>108</b> to remain in the deployed position, as described herein. As illustrated, the a retractable tooth <b>262</b> of the lock mechanism <b>134</b> automatically engages the lip <b>330</b> when the alternate frame <b>304</b> is moved into the position for deploying the expansion connector <b>108</b> as discussed herein. For example, an inclined lead surface <b>332</b> on the frame's lip portion <b>330</b> cooperates with the lead surface <b>258</b> to automatically engage the tooth <b>262</b> of the lock mechanism <b>134</b> when the alternate frame <b>304</b> is moved into the position for deploying the expansion connector <b>108</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0162">The retraction mechanism <b>246</b> automatically retracts the expansion connector <b>108</b> from the deployed position by pulling the frame <b>304</b> along the drive axis DA away from the upper body portion's front face <b>172</b> toward its rear face <b>248</b>. By example and without limitation, the biasing mechanism <b>250</b>, such as a tension spring (shown), is coupled between the rear face <b>248</b> and a simple catchment <b>334</b> at the second or near end <b>316</b> of the frame <b>304</b> adjacent to the handle <b>314</b>. The biasing mechanism <b>250</b> operates between the rear face <b>248</b> the catchment <b>334</b> for retracting the frame <b>304</b> toward the rear face <b>248</b>. The biasing mechanism <b>250</b> thereby operates to retract the expansion connector <b>108</b> from the deployed position when the locking latch mechanism <b>134</b> (shown) or alternative non-locking latch mechanism <b>244</b> is operated to release the frame's integral catch mechanism <b>312</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0163">Alternatively, a compression spring <b>335</b> is substituted for the compression spring as the biasing mechanism <b>250</b> of the retraction mechanism <b>246</b> for automatically retracting the expansion connector <b>108</b> from the deployed position. The compression spring <b>335</b> operates by pushing the frame <b>304</b> along the drive axis DA away from the upper body portion's front face <b>172</b> toward its rear face <b>248</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0164">As disclosed herein, the safety catch <b>124</b> will not interfere with retraction of the alternate frame <b>304</b>. However, the biasing mechanism <b>252</b> operates to reset the sensing means for sensing that the computer's casing <b>2</b> is emplaced on the docking station's bearing surface <b>104</b> before the expansion connector drive <b>118</b> can be operated.</p>
    <p num="p-0165"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> is an upside-down close-up view showing the edge mounting holes <b>148</b> formed along the mutual contact line <b>103</b> between the upper and lower body portions <b>102</b> <i>a</i>, <b>102</b> <i>b </i>of the docking station's two-piece body <b>102</b>. As discussed herein, the edge mounting holes <b>148</b> each provide novel means for holding for example but not limited to a square- or hex-shaped mechanical nut N with its threaded bore aligned with the respective mounting hole <b>148</b> substantially parallel with the bearing surface <b>104</b> and perpendicular to respective side faces <b>152</b> and <b>154</b> of the upper and lower body portions <b>102</b> <i>a</i>, <b>102</b> <i>b</i>. Any external device can be threadedly attached to the body <b>102</b> by means of the shaft S of a screw or bolt B being inserted into a selected one of the edge mounting holes <b>148</b> and threaded into the bore of the nut N.</p>
    <p num="p-0166">The edge mounting holes <b>148</b> are formed by a pair of mating shapes <b>336</b> and <b>338</b> formed in the docking station's two-piece body <b>102</b> through the mating upper and lower body portions <b>102</b> <i>a</i>, <b>102</b> <i>b</i>. The shapes <b>336</b>, <b>338</b> meet along the mutual contact line <b>103</b>. By example and without limitation, the edge mounting holes <b>148</b> are formed by a pair of mating semi-circular holes <b>336</b> and <b>338</b> formed in the docking station's two-piece body <b>102</b> through the mating upper and lower body portions <b>102</b> <i>a</i>, <b>102</b> <i>b </i>along the mutual contact line <b>103</b>. However, the mating holes <b>336</b>, <b>338</b> may alternatively be different in shape from semi-circular, for example, the holes <b>336</b>, <b>338</b> may be mating rectangular shapes that form a square hole when mated, or semi-hexagonal shapes that form a hexagonal shape when mated, or another combination of shapes that form an aperture adjacent to the mating line <b>103</b> of the upper and lower body portions <b>102</b> <i>a</i>, <b>102</b> <i>b</i>, and such shapes may be substituted for the semi-circular shapes illustrated without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Furthermore, the entire shape of the resultant edge mounting holes <b>148</b> may be alternatively formed in the edge of either one of the upper and lower body portions <b>102</b> <i>a</i>, <b>102</b> <i>b </i>without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, as illustrated by the edge mounting hole <b>148</b> at the far left of the figure, the edge mounting holes <b>148</b> may alternatively be formed as a generally “U” or “V” or square-shaped hole <b>336</b> entirely within an edge portion <b>340</b> of one of the side faces <b>154</b> of the lower body portion <b>102</b> <i>b</i>, or the front <b>172</b> or rear face <b>248</b>, while the mating hole is entirely eliminated from the upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a</i>, and the shape <b>338</b> is an edge portion <b>342</b> of an opposite face <b>154</b>, <b>174</b> or <b>248</b> of the upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a </i>that is exposed by the hole <b>336</b> in the lower body portion <b>102</b> <i>b</i>, whereby the edge mounting hole <b>148</b> is formed by the shaped hole <b>336</b> that is closed by the mating shape <b>338</b> of the upper body portion's exposed edge portion <b>342</b>. Alternatively, as illustrated by the edge mounting hole <b>148</b> at the center of the figure, the edge mounting holes <b>148</b> may alternatively be formed as a generally “U” or “V” or square-shaped hole <b>338</b> entirely within the edge portion <b>342</b> of the upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a</i>, while the mating hole <b>336</b> is entirely eliminated from the lower body portion <b>102</b> <i>b</i>, and the shape <b>336</b> is the edge portion <b>340</b> of the lower body portion <b>102</b> <i>b </i>that is exposed by the hole <b>338</b> in the upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a</i>, whereby the edge mounting hole <b>148</b> is formed by the shaped hole <b>338</b> that is closed by the mating shape <b>336</b> of the lower body portion's exposed edge portion <b>340</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0167">Each of the edge mounting holes <b>148</b> is backed by a respective nut pocket <b>346</b> formed by an open well <b>348</b>. As illustrated by the cross-sectional view of the edge mounting hole <b>148</b> and corresponding nut pocket <b>346</b>, the well <b>348</b> of the integral nut pocket <b>346</b> is formed in one of the upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a </i>or the lower body portion <b>102</b> <i>b </i>(shown). The well <b>348</b> is generally rectangular in cross-section and extends through the bottom plane <b>156</b> of the lower body portion <b>102</b> <i>b </i>past the contact line <b>103</b>. The well <b>348</b> is formed having an opening <b>350</b> formed in the bottom plane <b>156</b> of the lower body portion <b>102</b> <i>b </i>(shown) or adjacent to the bearing surface <b>104</b> in the upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a</i>. The nut pocket's well <b>348</b> and opening <b>350</b> thereto are sized to admit a nut N of a desired size, such as #2, #4, #6, #8, #10, ¼ inch, or metric size nut or bolt head H. For example, the well <b>348</b> is formed by a pair of spaced apart rigid side walls <b>352</b> and <b>354</b> that extend inwardly of the side face <b>154</b> of the lower body portion <b>102</b> <i>b </i>and downwardly of the bottom plane <b>156</b> and substantially perpendicular to each. The side walls <b>352</b>, <b>354</b> are sufficiently spaced to easily admit the nut N of the desired size without being significantly oversized such that the nut N cannot rotate in the well <b>348</b>. The side walls <b>352</b>, <b>354</b> may include a slight draft angle from the opening <b>350</b> toward the contact line <b>103</b>. The mating shapes <b>336</b>, <b>338</b> along the contact line <b>103</b> are correspondingly sized to admit the shaft of the bolt B sized to mate with the nut N.</p>
    <p num="p-0168"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> illustrates that an extension portion <b>356</b> of each well <b>348</b> extends past the contact line <b>103</b>. The extension portion <b>356</b> closes the end of the corresponding well <b>348</b>. The extension portion <b>356</b> is optionally formed integrally with the corresponding well <b>348</b>, and may optionally be formed into a point having integral bottom walls <b>358</b> and <b>360</b> that are contiguous along a corner <b>362</b> in the central bottom of the nut pocket's well <b>348</b>. Additionally, the bottom walls <b>358</b>, <b>360</b> may optionally form an included angle <b>363</b> therebetween centered about the corner <b>362</b>, the included angle <b>363</b> being constructed to mate with the angled walls of the nut N of the desired size and shape, i.e., square or hex. For example, the included angle <b>363</b> between the bottom walls <b>358</b>, <b>360</b> is structured to mate with the nut N such as a square or hex nut (shown), whereby the nut N is constrained from turning when torque is applied during insertion and tightening of the screw or bolt B. For example, the angle <b>363</b> formed by the bottom walls <b>358</b>, <b>360</b> is about 90 degrees to accommodate a square nut. Alternatively, the angle <b>363</b> is about 120 degrees to accommodate a hex nut.</p>
    <p num="p-0169">The extension portion <b>356</b> of the well <b>348</b> may be integral with the side walls <b>352</b>, <b>354</b> (shown at center and right) and extended from the upper or lower body portion <b>102</b> <i>b </i>(shown) past the contact line <b>103</b> toward the opposite lower or upper body portion <b>102</b> <i>a </i>(shown).

    <p num="p-0171">Also illustrated here is the simplicity of operation of the nut pockets <b>346</b>. Here, the nut pocket <b>346</b> is operated by simply dropping the nut N of the appropriate size through the opening <b>350</b> into the well <b>348</b> corresponding to the selected edge mounting hole <b>148</b> with two of the nut's parallel sides S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> oriented substantially parallel with the well's side walls <b>352</b>, <b>354</b>, as illustrated. Thereafter, the nut N falls into the extension portion <b>356</b> at the end of the well <b>348</b> and nests between the side walls <b>352</b>, <b>354</b> and the bottom walls <b>358</b>, <b>360</b> of the extension <b>356</b> that combine to form the bottom of the well <b>348</b>. Upon the nut N nesting in the extension portion <b>356</b> of the well <b>348</b>, the nut's threaded bore Nb substantially automatically self-aligns with the edge mounting hole <b>148</b>. Thereafter, the screw or bolt B of the appropriate size is inserted through the corresponding hole <b>148</b> and threaded into the nut's bore Nb for attaching a desired edge attachment.</p>

    <p num="p-0181"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> illustrates the novel display unit support <b>142</b> of the invention that is structured for supporting the computer's flat display unit <b>9</b>. The display unit support <b>142</b> includes an elongated rigid support arm <b>388</b> having a first pivot end portion <b>390</b> that is pivotally coupled to the docking station body <b>102</b>, the rigid support arm <b>388</b> being pivotal about a pivot axis <b>392</b> in a plane <b>394</b> that is substantially parallel and adjacent to the side faces <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> of the body portions <b>102</b> <i>a</i>, <b>102</b> <i>b </i>and substantially perpendicular to the upper body portion's bearing surface <b>104</b>. By example and without limitation, the pivot end <b>390</b> of the support arm <b>388</b> is coupled in a pivotal relationship with the two-piece body <b>102</b> by a pivot mechanism <b>398</b>. For example, the pivot mechanism <b>398</b> operates about the pivot axis <b>392</b> between a hub portion <b>400</b> of the body <b>102</b> and an enlarged shoulder portion <b>402</b> at the pivot end <b>390</b> of the arm <b>388</b>. According to one optional embodiment of the display unit support <b>142</b>, the shoulder portion <b>402</b> of the support arm <b>388</b> rotates about a pivot axle <b>404</b> (shown in one or more subsequent figures) that is aligned along the pivot axis <b>392</b> and extends between a hub portion <b>400</b> of the body <b>102</b> and the arm's shoulder portion <b>402</b>. Alternative embodiments of the pivot mechanism <b>398</b> may be substituted without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0182">The support arm <b>388</b> is constrained to operate about the pivot mechanism <b>398</b> with the shoulder portion <b>402</b> abutting the body's hub portion <b>400</b> by the pivot mechanism <b>398</b>. By example and without limitation, the axle <b>404</b> is optionally a screw or bolt passed through one of the edge mounting holes <b>148</b> of the type described herein and threaded into a nut <b>406</b> (shown in one or more subsequent figures) in one of the nut pockets <b>346</b> of the type described herein. Thereafter, a knob or handle <b>408</b> on the axle <b>404</b> is operated for tightening and loosening of the shoulder portion <b>402</b> of the support arm <b>388</b> vis-à-vis the hub portion <b>400</b> of the body <b>102</b> by turning relative to the nut <b>406</b> in the nut pocket <b>346</b> of the body <b>102</b>. Thus, the handle <b>408</b> on the head portion <b>410</b> of the axle <b>404</b> operates against an outside face <b>412</b> of the shoulder portion <b>402</b> of the support arm <b>388</b> to compress the shoulder portion <b>402</b> against the body's hub <b>400</b>. Accordingly, friction between the shoulder portion <b>402</b> and the hub <b>400</b> caused by tightening of the handle <b>408</b> on the head portion <b>410</b> of the axle <b>404</b> constrains the support arm <b>388</b> to remain in a selected rotational orientation with the upper body portion's bearing surface <b>104</b>. The display unit support <b>142</b> thus constrains the computer's flat display unit <b>9</b> in the selected rotational orientation. The rotational orientation of the support arm <b>388</b> of the display unit support <b>142</b> with the upper body portion's bearing surface <b>104</b> is thus infinitely adjustable by alternately loosening and tightening the handle <b>408</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0183">The novel display unit support <b>142</b> of the invention also includes a novel display unit clamping mechanism <b>414</b> adjacent to a second extreme support end portion <b>416</b> of the rigid support arm <b>388</b> opposite from the first pivot end portion <b>390</b>. By example and without limitation, the display unit clamping mechanism <b>414</b> adjacent to the second support end portion <b>416</b> of the support arm <b>388</b> is structured as a spring-loaded vice for constraining the display unit <b>9</b> relative to the support end portion <b>416</b> of the support arm <b>388</b>. Accordingly, the display unit <b>9</b> is pinched between an integral substantially rigid anvil <b>418</b> and a separate and rotatable substantially rigid jaw <b>420</b>. By example and without limitation, the clamping mechanism <b>414</b> includes the substantially rigid anvil <b>418</b> being integral with the elongated support arm <b>388</b>. The supporting anvil <b>418</b> is extended laterally to a longitudinal axis <b>422</b> of the support arm <b>388</b> to an extent <b>423</b> that at least an end portion <b>424</b> of the anvil <b>418</b> distal from the support arm <b>388</b> is projected into space in a position opposite from a portion of the bearing surface <b>104</b> in the vicinity of either one of the pair of fixedly positioned engaging pins <b>114</b> <i>a </i>and <b>114</b> <i>b </i>(shown) and spaced away from the computer bearing surface <b>104</b> by several inches. The anvil <b>418</b> is formed with an arcuate support surface <b>426</b> that is curved in a convex shape covering an extended arc having a substantially smooth face aligned generally with the longitudinal axis <b>422</b> of the elongated support arm <b>388</b> and facing toward the front face <b>172</b> of the body <b>102</b> <i>a </i>such that the hard shell backing portion <b>9</b> <i>b </i>of the display unit <b>9</b> is supported in an upright position relative to the keyboard <b>7</b> on the top face <b>2</b> <i>b </i>of the computer casing <b>2</b> by resting against the arcuate support surface <b>426</b> of the anvil <b>418</b>, as illustrated herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0184">The separate substantially rigid jaw <b>420</b> includes a first proximate barrel-shaped knuckle portion <b>428</b> that is projected inward of a substantially rigid finger <b>430</b>. The knuckle portion <b>428</b> of the jaw <b>420</b> is coupled to the anvil <b>418</b> adjacent to a heal portion <b>432</b> thereof proximate to the end portion <b>416</b> of the support arm <b>388</b>. The knuckle portion <b>428</b> spaces the rigid finger <b>430</b> away from the arcuate support surface <b>426</b> of the anvil <b>418</b> by a variable short distance <b>434</b> that is adjustably configured to permit the flat display unit <b>9</b> of the computer <b>1</b> to fit therebetween. The short distance <b>434</b> by which the finger <b>430</b> is spaced away from the arcuate support surface <b>426</b> of the anvil <b>418</b> is adjustable to accept therebetween different thicknesses t of flat display units <b>9</b> of different computers <b>1</b> (illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The short distance <b>434</b> is also variable as discussed herein to permit the flat display units <b>9</b> to rotate to different orientations with the keyboard <b>7</b> on the top face <b>2</b> <i>b </i>of the computer casing <b>2</b>, while remaining constrained against the arcuate support surface <b>426</b> of the anvil <b>418</b> by the jaw <b>420</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0185">Furthermore, an integral hard nub or button <b>436</b> (more clearly shown in one or more subsequent figures) is optionally projected slightly from an inward facing surface <b>438</b> of the rigid finger <b>430</b> adjacent to a second end <b>440</b> thereof distal from the first proximate knuckle portion <b>428</b> thereof. The jaw <b>420</b> is thus positioned in a pinching relationship to the anvil <b>418</b> such as to capture the display unit <b>9</b> between the arcuate support surface <b>426</b> of the anvil <b>418</b> and the nub <b>436</b> projected from the distal end <b>440</b> of the rigid finger <b>430</b>. Thus, the display screen surface portion <b>9</b> <i>a </i>of the display unit <b>9</b> is supported in an upright position relative to the keyboard <b>7</b> on the top face <b>2</b> <i>b </i>of the computer casing <b>2</b> by the rigid jaw <b>420</b>, as illustrated herein. Accordingly, the display unit <b>9</b> of the computer <b>1</b> is constrained from falling backward away from the keyboard <b>7</b> by the anvil <b>418</b>, and is simultaneously constrained from falling forward toward the keyboard <b>7</b> by the jaw <b>420</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0186">The display unit clamping mechanism <b>414</b> also includes a variable pressure resilient biasing mechanism <b>442</b> (detailed in a subsequent figure) that resiliently biases the jaw <b>420</b> toward the arcuate support surface <b>426</b> of the anvil <b>418</b> in the pinching relationship described herein. By example and without limitation, the biasing mechanism <b>442</b> automatically varies the spacing distance <b>434</b> to accommodate the varying cross-sectional thickness of the display unit <b>9</b> of the computer <b>1</b> of the prior art as the display unit <b>9</b> is rotated relative to the top face <b>2</b> <i>b </i>of the computer casing <b>2</b> about its hinge axis h into different upright positions at the back of the keyboard <b>7</b>.</p>

The edge recess <b>139</b> is sized such that the anvil <b>418</b> is nested below the bearing surface <b>104</b> so as not to interfere with seating of the computer <b>1</b>.

    <p num="p-0191">Furthermore, as illustrated here, the second end <b>440</b> of the rigid finger <b>430</b> extends sufficiently from the jaw <b>420</b> that the button <b>436</b> on the inward facing surface <b>438</b> thereof is extended over the hard shell lip portion <b>9</b> <i>c </i>of the display unit <b>9</b> onto the display screen <b>9</b> <i>d</i>. The rigid finger <b>430</b> thus wraps around the hard shell lip portion <b>9</b> <i>c </i>of the display unit <b>9</b>, and the button <b>436</b> thus falls below the lip portion <b>9</b> <i>c </i>onto the display screen <b>9</b> <i>d</i>. Accordingly, the novel display unit clamping mechanism <b>414</b> is constrained from slipping laterally off of the lip portion <b>9</b> <i>c </i>and inadvertently releasing the display unit <b>9</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0192"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44 through 50</figref> illustrate that the arcuate support surface <b>426</b> of the anvil <b>418</b> permits the backing portion <b>9</b> <i>b </i>of the display unit <b>9</b> to roll thereabout in smooth substantially constant contact during rotation relative to the keyboard <b>7</b> on the top face <b>2</b> <i>b </i>of the computer casing <b>2</b>.

    <p num="p-0200"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref> illustrates by example and without limitation the pivot mechanism <b>398</b> that constrains the support arm <b>388</b> to operate about the pivot axis <b>392</b> with the shoulder portion <b>402</b> abutting the body's hub portion <b>400</b>. By example and without limitation, when the pivot axle <b>404</b> is a screw or bolt such as a shoulder bolt, it includes a first threaded end <b>450</b> that is sized to pass through one of the body's edge mounting holes <b>148</b> of the type described herein. The threaded end <b>450</b> of the screw or bolt type pivot axle <b>404</b> is threaded into the nut <b>406</b> installed in one of the nut pockets <b>346</b> of the type described herein, wherein the nut <b>406</b> is optionally a lock nut of the hex variety. Additionally, a shaft portion <b>452</b> of the screw or bolt type pivot axle <b>404</b> passes through a complementary rotational clearance bore <b>454</b> which is formed through the shoulder portion <b>402</b> of the support arm <b>388</b> and which is sized to rotate smoothly about the pivot axle shaft portion <b>452</b>. The head portion <b>410</b> of the screw or bolt type pivot axle <b>404</b> distal from the body <b>102</b> is by example and without limitation constrained in a recessed nut pocket <b>456</b> formed in the knob or handle <b>408</b>.

Thus, the handle <b>408</b> on the head portion <b>410</b> of the pivot axle <b>404</b> operates against the outside face <b>412</b> of the shoulder portion <b>402</b> of the support arm <b>388</b> to compress an inside face <b>458</b> the shoulder portion <b>402</b> against an outside face <b>460</b> of the hub <b>400</b>. Accordingly, friction between the inside face <b>458</b> the shoulder portion <b>402</b> against an outside face <b>460</b> of the hub <b>400</b> constrains the support arm <b>388</b> to remain in a selected rotational orientation with the upper body portion's bearing surface <b>104</b>, whereby the display unit support <b>142</b> constrains the computer's flat display unit <b>9</b> in the selected rotational orientation. The rotational orientation of the support arm <b>388</b> of the display unit support <b>142</b> is thus infinitely adjustable relative to the upper body portion's bearing surface <b>104</b>.</p>

    <p num="p-0202"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref> illustrates by example and without limitation one alternative configuration of the pivot mechanism <b>398</b> wherein the head portion <b>410</b> of the screw or bolt type pivot axle <b>404</b> is constrained in the one of the body's nut pockets <b>346</b>.

The threaded end <b>450</b> of the pivot axle <b>404</b> is threaded into a complementary threaded bore <b>462</b> in the knob <b>408</b>, which is operable for tightening and loosening of the shoulder portion <b>402</b> of the support arm <b>388</b> vis-à-vis the hub portion <b>400</b> of the body <b>102</b> by turning relative to the pivot axle <b>404</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0203"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref> illustrates by example and without limitation another alternative configuration of the pivot mechanism <b>398</b>. For example, an optional resilient biasing mechanism <b>470</b> may be provided for biasing the shoulder portion <b>402</b> of the support arm <b>388</b> toward the face <b>460</b> on the hub portion <b>400</b> of the body <b>102</b>. By example and without limitation, the optional resilient biasing mechanism <b>470</b> may be formed of a conventional compression spring <b>472</b> installed inside an enlarged counter-bore <b>474</b> formed in the shoulder portion <b>402</b> through an opening <b>476</b> in the outside face <b>412</b> of the shoulder portion <b>402</b>. The spring portion <b>418</b> of the biasing mechanism <b>470</b> is constrained between a floor portion <b>478</b> of the counter-bore <b>420</b> and the head portion <b>410</b> of the screw or bolt type pivot axle <b>404</b>. Optionally, a washer <b>480</b> may be inserted between the bolt head <b>410</b> and the compression spring <b>472</b>. The spring portion <b>418</b> of the biasing mechanism <b>470</b> thus operates against the floor portion <b>478</b> of the counter-bore <b>474</b> to compress the inside face <b>458</b> of the shoulder portion <b>402</b> of the support arm <b>388</b> against the outside face <b>460</b> of the body's hub portion <b>400</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0204">Alternative embodiments of the resilient biasing mechanism <b>470</b> may be substituted without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0205">Additionally, a ratcheting mechanism <b>482</b> is optionally provided for securing the support arm <b>388</b> in rotational relationship with the bearing surface <b>104</b> of the body portion <b>102</b> <i>a</i>. By example and without limitation, a first quantity of one or more teeth <b>484</b> are provided on the outside face <b>460</b> of the hub <b>400</b> portion of the body <b>102</b> in a variable intermeshing relationship with a quantity of one or more notches <b>486</b> formed on the inside face <b>458</b> the arm's shoulder portion <b>402</b>. The intermeshing teeth <b>428</b> and notches <b>430</b> permit the arm to be secured in a desired rotational relationship with the body <b>102</b> for supporting the computer's display unit <b>9</b> in a desired discrete orientation relative to the docking station's computer bearing surface <b>104</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0206"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref> illustrates by example and without limitation the novel display unit clamping mechanism <b>414</b> of the display unit support <b>142</b> of the invention in an active configuration clamping the display unit <b>9</b> in an open position relative to the computer casing <b>2</b>. The novel display unit clamping mechanism <b>414</b> is positioned adjacent to a second extreme support end portion <b>416</b> of the rigid support arm <b>388</b> opposite from the first pivot end portion <b>390</b>. By example and without limitation, the display unit clamping mechanism <b>414</b> adjacent to the second support end portion <b>416</b> of the support arm <b>388</b> is a hand for constraining the display unit <b>9</b> relative to the support end portion <b>416</b> of the support arm <b>388</b>. As discussed herein, by example and without limitation, the clamping mechanism <b>414</b> includes the substantially rigid anvil <b>418</b> that is integral with the elongated support arm <b>388</b>. The anvil <b>418</b> is extended laterally to a longitudinal axis <b>422</b> of the support arm <b>388</b> with its end portion <b>424</b> being projected into space in a position above the bearing surface <b>104</b>. The arcuate support surface <b>426</b> of the anvil <b>418</b> is curved in the convex shape that covers an extended arc having a center of rotation <b>488</b> (best shown in one or more previous figures). The center of rotation <b>488</b> is oriented generally parallel with pivot axis <b>392</b> of the support arm <b>388</b>, substantially lateral of the longitudinal axis <b>422</b>, and substantially crosswise of the drive axis <b>444</b> of the biasing mechanism <b>442</b>. The smooth arcuate support surface <b>426</b> is directed generally toward the front face <b>172</b> of the body <b>102</b> <i>a </i>for supporting the hard shell backing portion <b>9</b> <i>b </i>of the display unit <b>9</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0207">The first proximate knuckle portion <b>428</b> of the separate jaw <b>420</b> is movably coupled to the anvil <b>418</b> adjacent to the heal portion <b>432</b> thereof. The finger portion <b>430</b> of the jaw <b>420</b> is thus spaced away from the arcuate support surface <b>426</b> of the anvil <b>418</b> by the variable short distance <b>434</b> that is adjustably configured to permit the flat display unit <b>9</b> of the computer <b>1</b> to fit therebetween. The short distance <b>434</b> by which the finger portion <b>430</b> of the jaw <b>420</b> is spaced away from the arcuate support surface <b>426</b> of the anvil <b>418</b> is adjustable to accept different thicknesses of flat display units <b>9</b> of different computers <b>1</b> therebetween. Furthermore, the integral hard nub or button <b>436</b> is optionally projected slightly from the inside surface <b>438</b> of the rigid finger <b>430</b> adjacent to its distal tip <b>440</b>. The jaw <b>420</b> is thus positioned in a pinching relationship to the anvil <b>418</b> such as to capture the display unit <b>9</b> between the arcuate support surface <b>426</b> and the projected nub <b>436</b> on the tip <b>440</b> of the rigid finger <b>430</b>. Thus, the display unit <b>9</b> is compressed against the arcuate support surface <b>426</b> of the anvil <b>418</b> by the hard nub <b>436</b> on the tip <b>440</b> of the rigid finger <b>430</b>, as illustrated herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0208">The display unit clamping mechanism <b>414</b> also includes the variable pressure resilient biasing mechanism <b>442</b> that resiliently biases the jaw <b>420</b> toward the arcuate support surface <b>426</b> of the anvil <b>418</b> to form the pinching relationship described herein. By example and without limitation, the biasing mechanism <b>442</b> automatically varies the spacing distance <b>434</b> to accommodate a varying cross-sectional thickness of the display unit <b>9</b> as it is rotated about its hinge axis h relative to the top face <b>2</b> <i>b </i>of the computer casing <b>2</b> into different upright positions at the back of the keyboard <b>7</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0209">By example and without limitation, the biasing mechanism <b>442</b> is constructed along the longitudinal drive axis <b>444</b> that is oriented generally crosswise of both the longitudinal axis <b>422</b> of the support arm <b>388</b> and the center of rotation <b>488</b> of the arcuate support surface <b>426</b> of the anvil <b>418</b>. By example and without limitation, the biasing mechanism <b>442</b> includes a compression spring <b>490</b> recessed inside a tubular spring cavity <b>492</b> that is counter-bored in a barrel-shaped spring casing <b>494</b> of the heal portion <b>432</b> at the support end portion <b>416</b> of the rigid support arm <b>388</b>. The tubular spring cavity <b>492</b> is substantially aligned along the longitudinal drive axis <b>444</b> of the biasing mechanism <b>442</b>. The tubular spring cavity <b>492</b> has a full size input opening <b>496</b> at it outer end, and terminates in a floor portion <b>498</b> at its inner end. A smaller guide pin portion <b>500</b> of the heal portion <b>432</b> extends from the barrel-shaped cavity <b>494</b> along the longitudinal drive axis <b>444</b>. The guide pin portion <b>500</b> of the heal portion <b>432</b> is formed therethrough with a tubular clearance bore <b>502</b> that communicates between the floor <b>498</b> of the tubular spring cavity <b>492</b> and an opening <b>504</b> at the clearance bore's outer tip <b>506</b>. The tubular clearance bore <b>502</b> through the guide pin portion <b>500</b> is sized to complement a pivot axle <b>508</b> such as a screw or bolt.</p>
    <p num="p-0210">The barrel-shaped knuckle portion <b>428</b> of the separate jaw <b>420</b> is projected inward of the inward facing surface <b>438</b> of the rigid finger <b>430</b> along the longitudinal drive axis <b>444</b> of the biasing mechanism <b>442</b>. The barrel-shaped knuckle portion <b>428</b> is formed with a complementary tubular counter-bore <b>510</b> that is sized to slidingly receive the guide pin portion <b>500</b> of the support arm's heal portion <b>432</b> through an opening <b>512</b> in the end of the knuckle portion <b>428</b> distal from the rigid finger <b>430</b>. The pivot axle <b>508</b> is projected substantially central of the tubular counter-bore <b>510</b> from a floor <b>514</b> thereof and along the longitudinal drive axis <b>444</b> of the biasing mechanism <b>442</b>. By example and without limitation, an aperture or passage <b>516</b> is formed in the floor <b>514</b> of the tubular counter-bore <b>510</b> and communicates with an outward facing surface <b>518</b> of the rigid finger <b>430</b> opposite from the inward facing surface <b>438</b>. When the pivot axle <b>508</b> is provided as a screw or bolt, the passage <b>516</b> is sized to receive a shaft portion <b>520</b> of the screw-type pivot axle <b>508</b>, while the aperture <b>516</b> is sized to constrain a head portion <b>522</b> from passing.</p>
    <p num="p-0211">When the tubular counter-bore <b>510</b> in the knuckle portion <b>428</b> of the jaw <b>420</b> is slidingly fit over the guide pin portion <b>500</b> projected from the support arm's heal portion <b>432</b>, the passage <b>516</b> in the floor of the tubular counter-bore <b>510</b> is substantially aligned with the tubular clearance bore <b>502</b> in the guide pin <b>500</b>. The shaft <b>520</b> of the pivot axle <b>508</b> is slidingly received through the passage <b>516</b>, along, the tubular clearance bore <b>502</b> in the guide pin portion <b>500</b> of the spring casing <b>494</b>, and into the tubular spring cavity <b>492</b>. The compression spring <b>490</b> is received over the pivot axle's shaft <b>520</b> and compressed in the tubular spring cavity <b>492</b> between the floor portion <b>498</b> at its inner end and a second end <b>524</b> of the pivot axle <b>508</b> opposite from its head <b>522</b>. For example, a nut <b>526</b> and optional washer <b>528</b> are installed onto the threaded end of the pivot axle shaft <b>520</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0212">Additionally, means are provided for securing the jaw <b>420</b> relative to the anvil <b>418</b> with the finger portion <b>430</b> positioned over the display screen surface <b>9</b> <i>a </i>of the display unit <b>9</b> opposite from the arcuate support surface <b>426</b>. By example and without limitation, a detent mechanism <b>530</b> is provided between the guide pin portion <b>500</b> of the anvil <b>418</b> and the knuckle portion <b>428</b> of the jaw <b>420</b>. The detent mechanism <b>530</b> may be formed by example and without limitation by one or more teeth <b>532</b> sized to slide into one or more slots <b>534</b> formed between the guide pin <b>500</b> and the knuckle portion <b>428</b> of the jaw <b>420</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0213">As described, the variable pressure resilient biasing mechanism <b>442</b> of the display unit clamping mechanism <b>414</b> resiliently biases the jaw <b>420</b> toward the arcuate support surface <b>426</b> of the anvil <b>418</b> in the pinching relationship described herein. As will be generally well-understood, the cross-sectional thickness t of the display unit <b>9</b> increases and decreases as it is rotated into different orientations relative to the keyboard <b>7</b> on the top face <b>2</b> <i>b </i>of the computer casing <b>2</b>, the cross-sectional thickness t varying between a minimum when the display unit <b>9</b> is in the substantially vertical upright position illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>, and a maximum when the display unit <b>9</b> is in the extreme over-center position illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0214">Accordingly, the biasing mechanism <b>442</b> floats the rigid finger <b>430</b> along the longitudinal drive axis <b>444</b> over the barrel-shaped portion <b>494</b> of the anvil <b>418</b>. The biasing mechanism <b>442</b> thus permits the clamping mechanism <b>414</b> to accommodate the varying, cross-sectional thickness t of the display unit <b>9</b> as it is rotated into different orientations relative to the keyboard <b>7</b> on the top face <b>2</b> <i>b </i>of the computer casing <b>2</b>. As the display unit <b>9</b> rotates from the substantially vertical upright position illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>, the cross-sectional thickness t increases, and the display unit <b>9</b> exerts pressure on the biasing mechanism <b>442</b>, which spreads the jaw portion <b>420</b> of the clamping mechanism <b>414</b> resiliently away from the anvil portion <b>418</b>. However, the spring <b>490</b> exerts an opposite compression pressure that squeezes the rigid finger <b>430</b> of the jaw <b>420</b> against the display screen surface <b>9</b> <i>a </i>so that the display unit <b>9</b> is pressed against the arcuate support surface <b>426</b> of the anvil <b>418</b>. Similarly, when the display unit <b>9</b> is rotated from any non-vertical position, such as the extreme over-center position illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>, the spring <b>490</b> continues to exert the compression pressure that squeezes the rigid finger <b>430</b> of the jaw <b>420</b> against the display screen surface <b>9</b> <i>a </i>so that the display unit <b>9</b> is pressed against the arcuate support surface <b>426</b> of the anvil <b>418</b> even while the cross-sectional thickness t decreases.</p>
    <p num="p-0215">Furthermore, as illustrated here, the second end <b>440</b> of the rigid finger <b>430</b> extends sufficiently from the jaw <b>420</b> that the button <b>436</b> on the inward facing surface <b>438</b> thereof is extended over the hard shell lip portion <b>9</b> <i>c </i>of the display unit <b>9</b> onto the display screen <b>9</b> <i>d</i>. As discussed elsewhere herein, the rigid finger <b>430</b> thus wraps around the hard shell lip portion <b>9</b> <i>c </i>of the display unit <b>9</b>. The biasing mechanism <b>442</b> operating along the longitudinal drive axis <b>444</b> forces the button <b>436</b> below the lip portion <b>9</b> <i>c </i>and against the display screen <b>9</b> <i>d</i>. Accordingly, the biasing mechanism <b>442</b> operates the button <b>436</b> to constrain the novel display unit clamping mechanism <b>414</b> from slipping laterally off of the lip portion <b>9</b> <i>c </i>and inadvertently releasing the display unit <b>9</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0216"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref> illustrates by example and without limitation the novel display unit clamping mechanism <b>414</b> of the display unit support <b>142</b> invention in a passive configuration wherein the hard shell backing portion <b>9</b> <i>b </i>of the display unit <b>9</b> is supported by the anvil <b>418</b> portion of the support arm <b>388</b> with the opposing jaw portion <b>420</b> in an open position relative to the display screen surface <b>9</b> <i>a</i>. Accordingly, the jaw <b>420</b> including the finger portion <b>430</b> is rotated away from the active position over the display screen surface <b>9</b> <i>a</i>. For example, the knuckle <b>428</b> is pulled away from the anvil <b>418</b> along the longitudinal drive axis <b>444</b> until the detent <b>530</b> disengages, i.e., until the teeth <b>532</b> slide free of the slots <b>534</b>. The jaw portion <b>420</b> is rotated until the finger <b>430</b> clears the display unit <b>9</b>. With the finger <b>430</b> in this passive configuration, the jaw <b>420</b> is freed and the compression spring <b>490</b> draws the knuckle <b>428</b> toward the anvil <b>418</b> along the longitudinal drive axis <b>444</b>. The teeth <b>532</b> and slots <b>534</b> may be additionally configured to form the detent <b>530</b> between the between the guide pin portion <b>500</b> and the knuckle portion <b>428</b> for securing the jaw <b>420</b> in the passive configuration vis-à-vis the anvil <b>418</b>.</p>
