No. 5,959,533, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>This invention relates to recording the movements of persons, specifically subjects under court ordered supervision. More particularly, this invention relates to correlating crime incident data with the history of a subject's locations by using an all body worn, non-removable, tamper resistant location recording apparatus. The location recording apparatus that when integrated with a communications network, law enforcement information systems, criminal justice and corrections information systems and a central correlation data base system, can perform correlation data processing of crime incidents with a subject's location at the time of the crime incident. This invention further relates to a crime incident and subject location correlation data base system that supports law enforcement and criminal justice investigative queries matching a subject's location history with location and time correlation query criteria. This invention further relates to an all body worn, low power location recording apparatus that when integrated with a residence interface unit attached to a land line telephone at the subject's residence or at locations in the community, transfers the location movement history stored in the subject's location recording apparatus to a central crime incident and subject location correlation data base.</p>
    <p>2. Description of the Background Art</p>
    <p>Currently, based on a 1997 U.S. Department of Justice report, there are over 3 million adults under court ordered community supervision on either parole or probation. A 1992 study by Langin and Cunniff found that 43% of felons sentenced to community supervision were arrested within 36 months for a new felony offense.</p>
    <p>A more comprehensive study was released by the U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics in 1995, which reviewed the criminal histories of 300,000 inmates incarcerated in 1991 that were previously on parole or probation. The study documented the crimes committed during the 13 to 17 months prior to their incarceration. While on probation or parole, the inmates murdered 13,200 people, raped 11,600 women and 1,300 men, robbed 39,500 people, assaulted 19,200 victims, burglarized 39,600 homes and businesses and stole 7,900 motor vehicles. These are the resolved crimes. The number of unresolved crimes is unknown, but it is estimated that as much as 30% of all crime is committed by subjects under community supervision. It is therefore no surprise that when crimes are committed in a community, law enforcement's prime suspects include subjects (released criminal offenders) under community supervision. Law enforcement investigative manpower is therefore focused on establishing the location of these subjects during the time of the criminal incident.</p>
    <p>Previously, monitoring the location of a person or subject, such as an offender, has been limited to knowing when the offender is at home. The apparatus used for “house arrest” or “electronic monitoring” uses a body worn, non-removable, tamper resistant radio frequency transmitter attached to a subject which communicates to a field monitoring device (FMD) at the subject's residence. The FMD communicates with a central data base system using the subject's telephone line to report when the subject is within a hundred feet of the FMD, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,918,432, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. Once the subject leaves the immediate area of the FMD, the location of the subject is unknown.</p>
    <p>Other techniques for locating a subject at a predetermined area utilizes the combination of caller identification and voice recognition. The phone number of the predetermined area is known, a voice signature sample of the subject is captured and voice signature with caller identification is matched, so as to locate the subject at the predetermined location, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,170,426, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. During the time between subject call-in reporting, the location of the subject is unknown.</p>
    <p>Currently, determining the location of a person or subject, such as an offender, is possible outside the confines of their respective residence. This apparatus can be seen in U.S. Pat. No. 5,731,757, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. This apparatus employed on the method is a tamper resistant body worn ankle wireless transmitter that communicates with an associated tamper resistant portable tracking apparatus. The portable tracking apparatus determines its location using Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites. The portable tracking apparatus communicates with a central data base system using wireless communications when portable and land-line communications when placed in a charging stand at the subject's residence or work location. Algorithms in the offender's portable tracking apparatus executing on the processor compare the offender's current location against a schedule of location rules stored in the memory of the offender's portable tracking apparatus. The purpose of a two part tracking device is to place the low power transmitter tag device as the body worn component and the high power consumption devices (i.e. conventional GPS receiver card, processor and memory card and wireless transceiver and data modem card) as an integrated portable unit that requires periodic recharging. The body worn transmitter tag device does not require battery recharging or replacement for extended time periods. If the subject forgets to transport the portable tracking device as the subject's location changes (i.e. from home to work), then the ability to locate the subject is lost. GPS signals are also attenuated by multistory buildings and underground structures which also prevents a subject from being located until the subject emerges from the structure.</p>
    <p>Other techniques for locating a subject outside of the confines of their residence or outside a predetermined area use radio frequency triangulation based on ground based tower infrastructure. The principle is based on the strength of a transmitted signal from the subject's apparatus being measured at a minimum of three towers in order to triangulate the position of the subject's apparatus as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,293,642, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. Another technique uses time of arrival (TOA) of a spread spectrum signal as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,548,583, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. Since both locating techniques use a subject transmitter and require a tower based infrastructure, once the subject leaves the area of tower coverage or the subject's transmitted signal is weakened by being inside structures, the ability to locate the subject is lost.</p>
    <p>Another approach to obtaining location, health and status is to poll the offender's and victim's portable tracking apparatus by placing a cellular phone call to the apparatuses which can be seen in U.S. Pat. No. 5,461,390, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. Polling the body worn device described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,748,148 (the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein) is accomplished by a dedicated ground based wireless tower network. These centralized polling approaches consume power by frequently using either traditional cellular communications or dedicated wireless communications that requires the receiver in the body worn or powered device to remain powered to respond to the poll. This is especially the case in higher risk subjects that have a history of predatory crimes.</p>
    <p>All of the location techniques described above are focused on immediate reporting of violations of house arrest, inclusion areas or exclusion areas. These systems are either limited in the ability to locate a subject outside a predetermined area, loose signals required to locate the subject as they move about authorized areas or are costly to procure and operate due to frequent wireless radio frequency (RF) communications. For these reasons, less than five percent of subjects under community supervision are monitored by electronic methods (i.e. electronic monitoring, GPS tracking, tower based RF triangulation, voice recognition/caller identification, etc.). Only the most violent, predatory or high profile subjects are supervised by electronic methods. The remaining subjects under community supervision are able to commit crimes of opportunity and violate their conditions of community supervision due to the anonymity of their movements in the community and the inability to correlate their movements to crime incidents.</p>
    <p>Currently, crime incident data is recorded in law enforcement computer aided dispatch systems (CAD) and record management systems (RMS). CAD systems record the time and location of dispatch but may not contain the actual time or location of the crime. The crime, such as a burglary, may have occurred earlier than reported or in the case of a corpse, the murder location may be different than the location where the corpse was found. The investigative data establishing the actual time and location of the crime may be found in the RMS. RMS and CAD systems are typically unique to each local law enforcement agency. There is seldom data sharing between adjacent law enforcement agencies therefore similar crime incidents that span local jurisdictions are seldom correlated.</p>
    <p>Criminal justice agencies (i.e. court, corrections, parole, probation, etc.) information management systems (IMS) contain criminal history and sentencing data related to felons but are seldom integrated with law enforcement RMS or CAD systems. The subject location data collected by service providers (i.e. electronic monitoring, GPS tracking, tower based RF triangulation, voice recognition/caller identification, etc.) for criminal justice agencies also exists in disparate systems that store the data, but don't share the data with law enforcement agencies.</p>
    <p>Recently, a low power, all body worn tracking apparatus was described in pending patent application entitled “BODY WORN ACTIVE AND PASSIVE TRACKING DEVICE”, Ser. No. 09/181,244, filed Oct. 28, 1998. This device, while significantly reducing size, weight, and power costs associated with tracking a subject, still incurs size, weight and power associated with wireless radio frequency (RF) communications in a wide area wireless infrastructure. Frequent apparatus health and status data and current real-time location data required for violent, predatory and high profile subjects require frequent RF transmissions across a wide area wireless network (i.e. cellular, PCS, etc.) driving wireless cost, component cost and frequent battery recharging or replacement.</p>
    <p>Current technology provides miniaturization of a GPS receiver, processor, memory and display for the purpose of navigation in the form factor of a wrist watch with Casio's GPS watch announcement at the Consumer Electronics Show in January, 1999.</p>
    <p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,583,776, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein, describes a GPS dead reckoning device that will track a person walking during periods of denied GPS signal strength such as inside multistory buildings or subterranean structures.</p>
    <p>Power generation for rechargeable batteries in the body worn tracking device is preferred to battery replacements since battery replacement provides the opportunity for contamination of the battery terminals and places the body worn device operational integrity responsibility with the subject being tracked. Battery recharging by connection to external power also provides the opportunity for body worn device tampering, contamination of charging leads, personal safety of the subject while attached to the charging power source and the physical constraint of a wire tether to the charging power source.</p>
    <p>Recently, an improved swinging type power generator was described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,684,761, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. The wrist worn device (typically housed in a watch) is based on the Fleming right-hand rule where a wire wound stator cuts magnetic lines of force to generate electricity. This improved device generates a square wave as opposed to a traditional sine wave from swinging arm motion resulting in improved efficiency of mechanically generated power.</p>
    <p>Recently, an improved solar cell manufacturing process described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,730,808, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein, can produce tandem solar cells with two benefits; the first benefit is light absorption from ultraviolet, visible and infrared spectrums resulting in power generation from a wider frequency spectrum, the second benefit is the improved process produces thinner solar cells that reduces the size. U.S. Pat. No. 5,779,817, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein, describes a circuit arrangement of solar cells that provides improved power transfer from solar cells to a load such as a rechargeable battery with a reduction in power loss.</p>
    <p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,627,548, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein, describes a transparent indium-tin-oxide on sapphire GPS antenna, a single integrated circuit chip that provides a low noise amplifier, down-conversion, timing code processing and navigation processing in a wrist watch form factor with batteries capable of being recharged by solar cells.</p>
    <p>Recently, IBM announced a new semiconductor process called silicon on insulator (SOI) which will increase current semiconductor power efficiency by 35 percent, especially for hand-held computers. IBM further announced high volume availability of SOI integrated circuits by mid 1999.</p>
    <p>Traditional basic integrated circuits required for a body worn location recording device such as processing, serial communications, parallel communications, memory, discrete input and discrete output can be imported as standard libraries, integrated and implemented on a single field programmable gate array (FPGA) integrated circuit. Such a capability is described by U.S. Pat. No. 5,773,993, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein, and available as a commercial product from XILINX Corporation as the CORE product name.</p>
    <p>Clearly, size, weight and power are critical requirements for any body worn locating device. Recent technology described above affords the ability to combine the elements into a wristwatch form factor to provide an all body worn location recording device. Other recent technology described above affords a low power body worn tracking solution through semiconductor SOI technology, matching filter GPS receiver techniques, miniature watch crystal type GPS antenna and current miniaturized processor and memory devices. With significantly reduced power consumption of subsystems required for location recording, improved solar cell wavelength absorption and swinging motion power generation techniques, the capability to produce an all body worn self rechargeable location recording device currently exists.</p>
    <p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,497,149, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein, describes a body worn locating device that is recharged using a plug-in wire battery charging interface to an external power source such as a wall power outlet. With technology known at the time of U.S. Pat. No. 5,497,149 and the lack of such technology disclosure in the embodiment of the Patent, it would not be feasible to construct a body worn device in the form factor depicted in FIG. 1 of the Patent. The device described in this Patent if constructed, would require large batteries and frequent battery recharging or battery replacement due to the amount of power consumed from conventional GPS receivers and cellular phone calls to periodically determine the location of the subject wearing the device, especially where unwilling subjects such as released criminal offenders are wearing the locating device where frequent (i.e. multiple times an hour) location points are desired. Other personal tracking devices found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,712,619, 5,742,509, 5,742,233, 5,528,248, 5,731,785, 5,714,931, 5,731,785 and 5,625,668, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein, do not address the low power technology required to implement a non removable, tamper resistant, body worn location recording device in a small, lightweight form factor that is either rechargeable using non contacting external power sources or can function for extended periods of time on a replaceable battery.</p>
    <p>There exists a need to implement a location recording apparatus for the purpose of recording a subject's movements in the community for subsequent correlation to crime incident data. Active and passive tracking systems described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,731,757 and the functionality described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/082,313 into a single body worn tamper resistant active tracking apparatus are not required to simply record the locations of a subject. For most subjects under community supervision, movements are not restricted other than in general terms (i.e. prostitution areas, drug dealing areas, etc.). Therefore specific exclusion locations (i.e. former victim's residence, victim's place of work, work release, etc.) are not actively monitored for most subjects and therefore do not require an active tracking device. There exists a need for a simple, low cost location recording device that will record the locations of a large segment of the subjects under community supervision to remove their anonymity.</p>
    <p>Since most subjects under community supervision can travel freely about the community, movements inside multistory buildings and underground structures are permitted. In the case of denial of GPS signals while the subject is inside buildings and structures, there exists a need for dead reckoning to record the location of the subject during periods of denial of GPS signals.</p>
    <p>In the case of small size, light-weight and low power, there exists a need for high density low power FPGA integrated circuit for the discrete digital functions of processor, memory, serial/parallel communications, analog input/output and digital input/output.</p>
    <p>For low cost and low power communications, there exists a need for the location recording apparatus to communicate over a short distance using low power infrared communications with a residence interface unit attached to a communications network (i.e. telephone, internet, etc.).</p>
    <p>In the case of correlating crime incident data with offender location history, there exists a need for an end-to-end system that; 1) integrates law enforcement RMS and CAD systems across jurisdictional boundaries, 2) integrates law enforcement RMS and CAD systems with subject location history stored in electronic monitoring systems, GPS tracking systems, tower based RF triangulation systems, and voice recognition/caller id locating systems and 3) integrates criminal justice IMS with law enforcement RMS and CAD systems.</p>
    <p>Recently, an end-to-end system concept for a low cost, body worn, tamper resistant location recording device and crime incident correlation data base system developed by the authors of this Patent Application, Hoyt M. Layson, Jr. and Gregory A. Frost, was submitted in a 1998 National Institute of Justice investigator funded research proposal titled “Florida CrimeTRAX”.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The problem of implementing an all body worn low cost subject location recording device integrated in an end-to-end system for correlation with crime incident data is solved by this invention. The low cost subject location recording device which is non-removable, tamper resistant, small, lightweight, can be powered by rechargeable or replaceable batteries and provides dead reckoning during GPS outages is accomplished by integrating several recently developed enabling technologies. The integration of subject location data with crime incident data is solved by this invention by integrating location data from current subject electronic locating techniques with isolated law enforcement and criminal justice information systems to support correlation of subject's location with crime incidents.</p>
    <p>The problem of sharing crime incident data across jurisdictional boundaries is solved by this invention. The crime incident/offender location database integrates the current isolated and unique law enforcement RMS and CAD systems.</p>
    <p>The problem of law enforcement having on-line information regarding criminal justice community supervision sentencing of a subject is solved by this invention. The problem of criminal justice community supervision having knowledge of a subject's current (i.e. just committed) law enforcement misdemeanors and felonies is solved by this invention. The crime incident/offender location correlation database supports investigative inquiries by law enforcement and criminal justice.</p>
    <p>The high power consumption manner and high wireless cost of transferring subject location data to a central data base are solved by this invention using lower power consuming infrared wireless communications to a nearby residence interface unit that connects to a low cost communications network (i.e. telephone, Internet, etc.).</p>
    <p>Significant power and size reductions can be achieved by integrating several integrated circuit chip devices such as processor, memory, serial input/output, digital input/output, etc.) on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) versus implementing discrete logic integrated circuits on a circuit board. Further power savings of up to 35% can be achieved by implementing all integrated circuits in low power SOI versions of the integrated circuits. Another power saving feature of this invention is the use of very low power infrared communications to transfer large amounts of data between the body worn tracking device and the residence interface unit.</p>
    <p>In addition to the power conserving technology described above, improved body motion power generation and solar power generation combined with efficient power transfer technology can be integrated in order to provide body worn device battery charging by a non contacting external charging means.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading> <p>Throughout the following detailed description, the same reference numerals refer to the same elements in all figures. Subject and offender are used herein to describe the person being located by conventional means or being located by the location recording device described in this patent application. Law enforcement agencies are used herein to describe city, county, state and federal law enforcement and investigative agencies. Corrections agencies are used herein to describe parole, probation, pre-trial sentencing, early release, work release or any form of public/private community supervision.</p>
    <p>FIG. 1 depicts the end-to-end crime incident/offender location correlation system and component subsystems. The crime incident/offender location correlation database <b>1</b> is a relational data base that receives crime incident data <b>2</b> and offender location data <b>3</b> on a continuous basis. The crime incident data <b>2</b> is delivered to the crime incident/offender location correlation data base <b>1</b> by a communications network <b>4</b> which can be dial-up, point-to-point, Internet or Intranet based. The offender location data <b>3</b> is delivered to the crime incident/offender location correlation data base <b>1</b> by a communications network <b>5</b> which can be dial-up, point-to-point or Internet based.</p>
    <p>Crime incident data <b>2</b> is comprised of crime incident dispatch data <b>7</b> obtained from computer aided dispatch (CAD) <b>6</b> systems and crime incident investigative data <b>9</b> from record management systems (RMS) <b>8</b> within law enforcement agencies. The crime incident/offender location correlation data base <b>1</b> performs data translations, as is known in the art, of the various data representations from unique CAD <b>6</b> and RMS <b>8</b> systems to arrive at a common data base format for each data item (i.e. date format, time format, etc.). Additional offender data <b>35</b> (i.e. sentencing, demographics, criminal history) is provided by information management systems (IMS) <b>34</b> within corrections agencies to assist law enforcement with additional information regarding offenders processed by the crime incident/offender location correlation data base <b>1</b>.</p>
    <p>Offender location data <b>3</b> is comprised of location data derived from the following sources;</p>
    <p>1) House arrest location systems <b>10</b> as known in the art that provide location data when the offender is at home,</p>
    <p>2) Location recording <b>14</b> as described by this invention that collects locations of offenders determined by GPS, on a twenty four hour basis,</p>
    <p>3) Continuous location monitoring <b>18</b> of offenders determined by GPS as known in the art , on a twenty four hour basis,</p>
    <p>4) Continuous location monitoring <b>22</b> of offenders determined by RF triangulation as known in the art on a twenty four hour basis,</p>
    <p>5) Voice recognition with caller identification locating systems <b>26</b> as known in the art that provide location data when the offender calls and</p>
    <p>6) Mobile cellular triangulation locating systems <b>30</b> as known in the art that provide location data when the offender calls or is called.</p>
    <p>The crime incident/offender location correlation data base <b>1</b> performs data translations, as is known in the art, of the various data representations from the unique sources of offender location data described above.</p>
    <p>House arrest location systems <b>10</b> typically use a standard telephone connection <b>11</b> to transmit data to a central data base <b>12</b> when the offender's body worn tamper resistant transmitter, as is known in the art, is within range of a receiver connected to the phone line <b>11</b> at the offender's residence. Additional tamper information for the body worn transmitter and receiver is sent to the central database <b>12</b>. The offenders time at their residence data <b>13</b> is comprised of the offender's residence address, which can be geo-coded into latitude and longitude and the times when the offender is at the residence.</p>
    <p>Location recording using GPS <b>14</b> uses a body worn location recording device (LRD) that records the location of the offender at programmable time intervals as the offender moves through the community. A receiver, hereinafter referred to as the residence interface unit (RIU), connected to the offender's residence phone line <b>15</b> communicates with the body worn location recording device to receive the offender's location history stored in the body worn location recording device. The RIU then communicates over the offender's telephone line <b>15</b> to a central database <b>16</b>. The location history <b>17</b> is comprised of time-stamped offender location history and additional tamper information for both the body worn LRD and the RIU.</p>
    <p>Continuous location monitoring using GPS <b>18</b>, uses a body worn tamper resistant transmitter, as is known in the art, and a portable tracking device which has a receiver for the body worn transmitter. The processor and memory continuously monitor the offender's location and compares the current location against inclusion and exclusion locations stored in the portable tracking device. Heartbeat data transmissions comprised of apparatus status, offender location and violation notifications can be sent through the wireless communication network <b>19</b> as well as the stored locations of the offender's movements. A central data base facility <b>20</b> stores the location data received from the portable tracking device. The location history <b>21</b> is comprised of time-stamped offender location history and additional tamper information for both the body worn transmitter and the portable tracking device.</p>
    <p>Continuous location monitoring using radio frequency (RF) triangulation <b>22</b> uses a body worn tamper resistant transmitter, as is known in the art, to transmit signals which are processed by a tower based network <b>23</b> to triangulate the location of the offender. A central data base facility <b>24</b> stores the time-stamped location data received from the tower-based network <b>23</b>. The location history <b>25</b> is comprised of time-stamped offender location history and additional tamper information for the body worn transmitter.</p>
    <p>Voice recognition caller identification locating systems <b>26</b>, as known in the art, match the offender's digitized voice signature to the offender's voice when the offender calls on a telephone connected <b>27</b> to a central data base facility <b>28</b>. The central data base facility <b>28</b> performs the signal processing to match the offender's call-in voice with the pre-recorded digitized voice signature, performs caller identification and stores the time and location of the offender's phone call. The location history <b>29</b> is comprised of time-stamped location history of offender calls to the central data base facility <b>28</b>.</p>
    <p>Mobile cellular triangulation location <b>30</b>, as is known in the art, triangulates the location of a personal communication device (i.e. a cellular phone, two-way pager, etc.) when the personal communication device transmits data to the cellular towers <b>31</b>. The central data base facility <b>32</b> stores the time and location determined by the cellular network <b>31</b>. The location history <b>33</b> is comprised of time-stamped location history of offender cellular data communications.</p>
    <p>The law enforcement query terminal <b>37</b> receives automated correlation reports and query results <b>38</b> using its connection to the communications network <b>4</b>. Results <b>36</b> from the crime incident/offender correlation data base <b>1</b> are comprised of automated correlation of crime incidents to offender locations and structured queries entered by law enforcement personnel.</p>
    <p>The corrections query terminal <b>39</b> receives automated violation reports and query results <b>40</b> using its connection to the communications network <b>4</b>. Results <b>36</b> from the crime incident/offender correlation data base <b>1</b> are comprised of automated offender violation reports and structured queries entered by corrections personnel.</p>
    <p>FIG. 2 depicts the body worn LRD <b>50</b> and component subsystems. The body worn LRD <b>50</b> case is comprised of a high impact plastic <b>58</b> that has low attenuation properties for wireless frequencies of GPS to permit incorporation of an enclosed high efficiency active GPS antenna.</p>
    <p>The body worn LRD <b>50</b> case contains retaining slots <b>71</b> for the adjustable attaching strap <b>63</b> and strap electrical continuity circuit <b>62</b> connections to implement strap tamper detection as is known in the art in the event the strap <b>63</b> is severed. The strap <b>63</b> incorporates an adjustable hasp <b>65</b> as is known in the art and a tamper resistant seal <b>64</b> prevents the hasp <b>65</b> from being opened without permanently damaging the tamper resistant seal <b>64</b>. The tamper resistant seal <b>64</b> is placed on the hasp <b>65</b> at the time the LRD <b>50</b> is attached to the subject.</p>
    <p>The waterproof battery cover <b>69</b> is held in place by screw threads. The waterproof battery cover <b>69</b> fits inside a recessed threaded flange <b>70</b> which completes a tamper continuity circuit when tightened. The pressure exerted by the water proof battery cover <b>69</b> when tightened compresses the lip of the waterproof battery cover <b>69</b> against the threaded flange <b>70</b> to form a water tight seal. A sealed compartment for the rechargeable/replaceable batteries <b>68</b> is formed inside the body worn LRD <b>50</b> case with the only opening being sealed by the waterproof battery cover <b>69</b>. This design does not require the body worn LRD <b>50</b> to be removed from the subject in order to replace the batteries <b>68</b>. Tamper detection screw threads <b>70</b> in the body-worn LRD <b>50</b> case cause a break in continuity when the waterproof battery cover <b>69</b> is loosened.</p>
    <p>A swinging power generator <b>66</b> described by U.S. Pat. No. 5,684,761 is included herein by reference. The improved swinging power generator <b>66</b> described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,684,761 for electric watch battery recharging from swinging arm motion is increased in size to deliver increased power to recharge the battery(s) <b>68</b> in the body worn LRD <b>50</b> from swinging arm motion. The swinging motion generator <b>66</b> design produces a square wave which delivers 30% more power than a sine wave generated by previous swinging motion generators.</p>
    <p>The main circuit board <b>67</b> is stiffened and the components staked as is known in the art to provide a ruggedized design to withstand shocks generated by arm motion and impacts with objects.</p>
    <p>A solar cell array <b>52</b> comprised of multi-junction solar cells described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,730,808 and is incorporated herein by reference. There are two advantages to multi-junction solar cells; 1) light absorption in the solar spectrum is expanded to include ultra-violet (UV), visible and infrared (IR) and 2) thinner form factor to absorb the same amount of energy. A broader solar spectrum will produce more power in all conditions of light intensity and artificial light sources such as incandescent.</p>
    <p>A low power liquid crystal diode (LCD) display <b>51</b> provides time, date and instructional messages for the subject. A scroll up message button <b>57</b> and a scroll down message button <b>56</b> allows the subject to scroll through large or multiple messages on the display <b>51</b>. The mode button <b>55</b> allows the subject to change the mode of the display <b>51</b> (i.e. message, date, time, etc.).</p>
    <p>A receive infrared diode <b>54</b> allows the body worn LRD <b>50</b> to receive data and commands from the residence interface unit (RIU). A transmit infrared diode <b>53</b> allows the body worn LRD <b>50</b> to send data and commands to the RIU.</p>
    <p>A piezo <b>60</b> device, as known in the art, provides an audible means to alert the subject of a message on the display <b>60</b>. A piezo acknowledge button <b>59</b> provides a means to silence the piezo and record the subject's acknowledging the message on the display <b>51</b>.</p>
    <p>A display back light button <b>61</b> provides a low power illumination for the display <b>51</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 3 describes the operation of the body worn LRD <b>50</b> with the residence interface unit (RIU) <b>80</b>. The subject's location is derived by the LRD <b>50</b> determining its spatial coordinates using GPS satellites <b>82</b> or by its dead reckoning circuit <b>130</b>. When the subject <b>87</b> is near a RIU, such as the subject's residence <b>86</b>, a wireless infrared data link <b>81</b> transfers commands and data between the LRD <b>50</b> and RIU <b>80</b>. Weatherproof RIUs <b>80</b> could also be placed strategically in the community as reporting stations to afford more frequent communications on a subject's <b>87</b> movements. The RIU is attached to a telephone <b>83</b> which can be either wire line <b>15</b> or wireless in order to communicate with the central data base <b>16</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 4 describes the major subsystems comprising the residence interface unit (RIU) <b>80</b>. The RIU case <b>100</b> houses all the components and made from high impact plastic. The RIU cover <b>101</b> is attached using tamper resistant screws <b>102</b> as is known in the art. The tamper resistant screws <b>102</b> make or break a continuity tamper circuit in the RIU case <b>100</b> screw threads <b>103</b> when the tamper resistant screws <b>102</b> are tightened or loosened.</p>
    <p>An infrared transmit diode array <b>104</b> allows the RIU <b>80</b> to send commands and data to the LRD <b>50</b>. An infrared receive diode array <b>105</b> allows the RIU <b>80</b> to receive commands and data from the LRD <b>50</b>. The arrays are arranged on a 180 degree curved surface to facilitate 1) continuous communications <b>81</b> with the LRD <b>50</b> while the subject <b>87</b> is moving in the room where the RIU <b>80</b> is located and 2) indirect communications <b>81</b> with the LRD <b>50</b> when the LRD <b>50</b> infrared diodes <b>53</b>,<b>54</b> cannot directly face the RIU <b>80</b> infrared diodes <b>104</b>,<b>105</b>. Data modulated on the infrared beams can reflect off solid surfaces such as wall, floors and ceilings and effectively transfer data.</p>
    <p>A speaker <b>106</b> for generating alert tones for the subject <b>87</b> is protected from damage by a speaker grill <b>107</b>. The fine mesh of the speaker grill <b>107</b> also prevents insects from entering the RIU <b>80</b>.</p>
    <p>A large capacity rechargeable battery <b>108</b> provides power for the RIU <b>80</b> should external power fail for extended periods of time.</p>
    <p>The RIU circuit board <b>118</b> contains the following major components;</p>
    <p>1) Battery recharging circuit <b>109</b>,</p>
    <p>2) A field programmable gate array (FPGA as is known in the art) <b>110</b> which contains a processor, memory, serial I/O, discrete I/O and analog driver circuits;</p>
    <p>3) A memory battery <b>111</b> to keep the RIU <b>80</b> program and data in the event that external power and the large capacity rechargeable battery <b>108</b> fail and</p>
    <p>4) A telephone data modem <b>112</b> as is known in the art to transmit and receive commands and data between the RIU <b>80</b> and the central data base facility <b>16</b>.</p>
    <p>The RIU cover <b>101</b> contains a LCD message display <b>113</b> to provide instructions to the subject from the RIU <b>80</b> or the central data base facility <b>16</b>. The RIU cover <b>101</b> also contains response push buttons so the subject can perform the following:</p>
    <p>1) Acknowledge messages or questions with the yes button <b>114</b>;</p>
    <p>2) Respond with a negative answer with the no button <b>115</b>;</p>
    <p>3) Scroll backward through multiple messages or a large message with the scroll up <b>116</b> button or</p>
    <p>4) Scroll forward through multiple messages or a large message with the scroll down <b>117</b> button.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5 describes a functional block diagram of the body-worn LRD <b>50</b>. The components of the LRD <b>50</b> provide the capability of a wrist-worn LRD <b>50</b> that will record locations of a subject <b>87</b> using GPS, dead reckon the location of a subject <b>87</b> during periods of denial of GPS while the subject <b>87</b> is walking, provides two-way infrared communications to transfer commands and data and incorporates tamper detection to prevent undetected removal of the LRD <b>50</b>.</p>
    <p>An active GPS high gain, low noise antenna <b>120</b> as is known in the art collects and amplifies GPS signals for the GPS receiver <b>121</b>. A small, thin, transparent GPS antenna with an integrated low noise amplifier is described by U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,345,244 and 5,627,548 can be used as the watch display crystal and is incorporated herein by reference. The form factor of this antenna allows it to be placed on top of the LRD display <b>51</b> and solar cell array <b>52</b> without attenuating the light energy or increasing the thickness dimension of the body worn LRD <b>50</b>.</p>
    <p>A matched filtering GPS Receiver <b>121</b> implemented on a single DSP integrated circuit is described by U.S. Pat. No. 5,663,734 and incorporated herein by reference. This matched filtering GPS receiver incorporates the following power saving features; 1) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms that are 10 to 100 times faster than traditional computational approaches, 2) DSP or FPGA single integrated circuit implementation, and 3) instant location fix upon power up of the radio frequency front end allowing the power down of the GPS receiver to achieve a typical less than 0.01% GPS receiver duty cycle or a two orders of magnitude reduction in power consumed by a conventional GPS receiver. A GPS radio frequency (RF) front end is implemented on a single integrated circuit (IC) as is known in the art and a single IC RF transceiver has been described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,438,491. A single RF front end is used for the matched filtering GPS receiver <b>121</b> cutting RF front end stand-by power in half and reducing the size and weight of the body-worn LRD <b>50</b>.</p>
    <p>A key requirement for the low power and quick operation of a matched filtering GPS receiver <b>121</b> is to have the GPS almanac data as is known in the art immediately available upon power-up of the GPS receiver <b>121</b>. A GPS almanac memory <b>122</b> with a memory battery <b>129</b> allows the matched filtering GPS receiver <b>121</b> to provide a location within a second as opposed to minutes.</p>
    <p>A dead reckoning circuit <b>130</b> described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,583,776 is employed to provide the capability to dead reckon the movements of the subject <b>87</b> when denial of GPS signals occurs and is incorporated herein by reference. Denial of GPS signals may occur when the subject <b>87</b> is inside multistory buildings or enters subterranean structures. Since the dead reckoning circuit <b>130</b> is based on body movement, the circuit is optimally suited for dead reckoning the subject <b>87</b> when there is denial of GPS signals when the subject <b>87</b> is walking. Since the error is 1% for distance traveled, the subject <b>87</b> can walk 10,000 feet with denial of GPS signals and still be located by dead reckoning within the accuracy of commercial GPS.</p>
    <p>A field programmable gate array <b>128</b> (FPGA) as is known in the art is employed to integrate the major analog and digital components. The FPGA comprising a microprocessor <b>127</b>, location memory <b>123</b>, program memory <b>126</b>, GPS almanac memory <b>122</b>, serial I/O <b>124</b> and digital I/O <b>125</b> described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,731,757 assigned to XYLINX Corporation is included herein by reference. Prior to U.S. Pat. No. 5,773,993, the process of programming complex devices, such as a microprocessor, into a FPGA would have been cost and time prohibitive. The domain implementation described in to U.S. Pat. No. 5,773,993 allows programming a complex device into a FPGA by including a previously developed software library for the complex device as is known in the art. Today with a 500,000 gate XYLINX FPGA, the exact microprocessor, memory, serial I/O, digital I/O, analog to digital converters and associated glue logic chips, as is known in the art, of the processor board described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,731,757 can be implemented in a single FPGA. XYLINX has recently announced a 1,000,000 gate FPGA for late 1998. The power savings realized by implementing the body worn tracking device <b>1</b> digital and analog logic in an FPGA is 50% to 70% by known industry standards. This power savings is achieved by using gate level interconnects as opposed to chip level interconnects. Chip level interconnects are designed by the manufacturer for “worst case” loads and path length capacitance charging/discharging effects which results in high power interface gates for each connection on the chip.</p>
    <p>The GPS almanac memory <b>122</b> and the location memory <b>123</b> are volatile memory as known in the art and are power backed-up by a memory battery <b>129</b>. The program memory <b>126</b> is non-volatile programmable memory as known in the art and does not require a memory battery <b>129</b>.</p>
    <p>The serial I/O <b>124</b> interfaces the message display <b>51</b>, infrared receiver diode <b>54</b>, infrared transmitter diode <b>53</b> and the GPS receiver <b>121</b> to the micro processor <b>126</b>. The digital I/O interfaces the pushbuttons <b>55</b>,<b>56</b>,<b>57</b>,<b>59</b>,<b>61</b>, tamper sensors <b>62</b>,<b>70</b>, and piezo <b>60</b> to the micro processor <b>126</b>.</p>
    <p>A transmit IR diode <b>53</b> and a receive IR diode <b>54</b> are incorporated in LRD <b>50</b> facing outward. The transmit IR diode <b>53</b> and a receive IR diode <b>54</b> are used for low power full duplex communications while the subject <b>87</b> is at a location, such as the subject's residence <b>86</b>, where; 1) the body worn LRD <b>50</b> can download location history of the subject's <b>87</b> movements to the RIU <b>80</b>, 2) the body worn LRD <b>50</b> can download any messages to be displayed to the subject on the RIU <b>80</b> and 3) the RIU <b>80</b> can upload any program or data updates from the central data base facility <b>16</b> to the body worn LRD <b>50</b>. The transmit IR diode <b>53</b> and a receive IR diode <b>54</b> consume {fraction (1/100)}th the power required for RF (i.e. cellular) full duplex communications with the central data base facility <b>16</b>. This power saving method of infrared wireless data transfer is beneficial over traditional RF wireless methods.</p>
    <p>The analog to digital circuit <b>131</b> converts analog voltage levels from the rechargeable/replaceable batteries <b>68</b>, solar cell array <b>52</b>, and swinging power generator <b>66</b> to digital data for the micro processor <b>126</b>.</p>
    <p>A battery charging circuit <b>132</b> described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,779,817 is specifically tailored for recharging a battery with solar cells and is incorporated herein by reference. This circuit transfers the optimum power and compensates for the charging profile of the battery when the battery charge is between 10% and 100% resulting in minimum power loss transfer from solar cells. An additional circuit described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,760,572 is employed in the battery charging circuit <b>132</b> to provide for optimum solar cell charging of a battery during intermittent loads without wasting power and is incorporated herein by reference. Such intermittent loads would occur when switching power loads on such as a GPS receiver.</p>
    <p>The combination of; 1) dramatically lowering power consumption using power saving technology devices, 2) power saving cycling techniques, 3) improved power generating devices, 4) infrared low power wireless communications and 5) improved power transferring circuits for battery recharging make a LRD <b>50</b> operational for extended periods of time. Extended operational time is very significant if the subject <b>87</b> wearing the body-worn LRD <b>50</b> should not be responsible for the assured operation of the body-worn LRD. The extended time of operation permits the supervising agency to be responsible for battery replacement in the body-worn LRD <b>50</b> and also removes risks associated with connecting external power to the body-worn LRD <b>50</b> while being worn by the subject <b>87</b>.</p>
    <p>The combination of; 1) thin form factor solar cells, 2) a thin transparent GPS antenna, 3) a processor with memories, serial I/O and digital I/O on a FPGA chip, 4) matched filtering GPS receivers on an ASIC and DSP chip and 4) a GPS RF front-end on a single integrated circuit, 5) permit the body-worn LRD <b>50</b> to be packaged in a small wrist-worn form factor and be a lightweight device. The light weight and small form factor of the body-worn LRD <b>50</b> is very significant since there will be less interference with occupational duties and less fatigue for the subject <b>87</b> wearing the body-worn LRD <b>50</b>.</p>
    <p>The dead reckoning integrated circuit <b>130</b> allows subject <b>87</b> location recording while the subject <b>87</b> walks in buildings or subterranean structures where there is denial of GPS signals. The ability to track or record locations of a subject <b>87</b> while in a building or subterranean work environment is very significant since public safety is better assured while the offender <b>87</b> is allowed to have an occupation travel about the community but without anonymity.</p>
    <p>FIG. 6 describes a functional block diagram of the RIU <b>80</b>. The RIU <b>80</b> provides the LRD <b>50</b> a low power and low cost communications interface to the central data base facility <b>16</b> by using infrared communications with the LRD <b>50</b> and local phone access and/or the Internet to the central data base facility <b>16</b>.</p>
    <p>The receive infrared diode array <b>105</b> receives data from the LRD <b>50</b>. The transmit infrared diode array <b>104</b> sends data to the LRD <b>50</b>. The serial I/O <b>146</b> interfaces the transmit infrared diode array <b>104</b> and the receive infrared diode array <b>105</b> to the micro processor <b>143</b>. The serial I/O <b>146</b> also interfaces the micro processor <b>143</b> to the data modem <b>112</b> as is known in the art to exchange commands and data between the RIU <b>80</b> and the central data base facility <b>16</b>. The serial I/O interfaces the message display <b>113</b> to the micro processor <b>143</b>.</p>
    <p>The digital I/O <b>145</b> interfaces the RIU tamper sensors <b>103</b> to the micro processor <b>143</b>. The digital I/O also interfaces the response buttons <b>144</b>, <b>115</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>117</b> to the micro processor <b>143</b>.</p>
    <p>The battery charging circuit <b>109</b> recharges the large capacity power interruption battery <b>108</b>. A memory battery <b>111</b> retains the program and data memory <b>144</b> should the power interruption battery <b>108</b> be depleted.</p>
    <p>An audio driver circuit <b>140</b> as known in the art provides power for the audio speaker <b>106</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 7 is a flowchart of the method of operation for the LRD <b>50</b>. The LRD <b>50</b> determines its spatial location by processing GPS signals or by dead reckoning the walking movements of the subject <b>87</b>. The LRD <b>50</b> stores location data until the data can be transferred to the RIU <b>80</b>. The LRD <b>50</b> detects tamper conditions or conditions that affect LRD <b>50</b> performance and stores those conditions for subsequent data transfer to the RIU <b>80</b>. The LRD <b>50</b> accepts commands and data from the RIU <b>80</b> and stores them in the appropriate LRD memory. The LRD <b>50</b> communicates with the subject <b>87</b> using an audible piezo notification and text messages. The LRD <b>50</b> performs these functions as an iterative process where the time interval for each iteration is programmable.</p>
    <p>The LRD <b>50</b> activates the GPS receiver <b>121</b> and checks for a GPS location <b>150</b> (i.e. latitude and longitude). If there is a GPS location <b>150</b> then the time stamped location is stored <b>151</b> in the LRD location memory <b>123</b>. If the GPS receiver <b>121</b> cannot determine a location then the dead reckoning circuit <b>130</b> is checked for a location <b>155</b>. If the dead reckoning circuit <b>130</b> provides a location <b>155</b> then the time stamped location is stored <b>151</b> in the LRD location memory <b>123</b>. If neither the GPS receiver <b>121</b> or the dead reckoning circuit <b>130</b> can determine a location, then the LRD <b>50</b> displays acquire GPS <b>156</b> on the LRD message display <b>51</b>. The LRD <b>50</b> then activates the piezo <b>60</b> audible alert <b>157</b>. The LRD <b>50</b> then checks to see if the piezo acknowledged button <b>59</b> has been pressed <b>158</b>. If the piezo acknowledged button <b>59</b> has not been pressed <b>158</b>, the LRD <b>50</b> activates the GPS receiver <b>121</b> to obtain a location <b>150</b>. If the piezo acknowledged button <b>59</b> has been pressed <b>158</b>, then the LRD <b>50</b> waits for a programmable interval <b>159</b> before activating the GPS receiver <b>121</b> to obtain a location <b>160</b>. If the GPS receiver <b>121</b> provides a location <b>160</b>, then the time stamped location is stored <b>151</b> in the LRD location memory <b>123</b>. If after notifying the subject to acquire GPS <b>156</b>,<b>157</b> and waiting for the programmed time interval <b>159</b> there is still no GPS location <b>160</b>, the violation is stored <b>161</b> in the LRD location memory <b>123</b>.</p>
    <p>After storing a location <b>151</b> in the LRD location memory <b>123</b>, the LRD checks to see if there have been any tampers detected <b>152</b>. These tampers can be hard tampers such as; 1) the removal of the LRD <b>50</b> by opening the adjustable strap hasp <b>65</b> or severing the strap and breaking the strap continuity circuit <b>62</b> or 2) loosening the waterproof battery cover <b>69</b>. The tampers could be soft tampers such as not replacing the batteries <b>68</b> when notified on the message display <b>51</b>. If there are any tamper violations, they are stored <b>161</b> on the LRD location memory <b>123</b>.</p>
    <p>If there are locations stored <b>151</b> in the LRD location memory <b>123</b>, the LRD <b>50</b> checks to see if the current location is near the subject's residence <b>153</b>. If the LRD <b>50</b> is not near the subject's residence <b>153</b>, then the LRD <b>50</b> continues to record locations <b>150</b>. If the LRD <b>50</b> is near the subject's residence <b>153</b>, then the LRD <b>50</b> listens for an infrared signal from the RIU <b>154</b>. If a signal from the RIU <b>80</b> is detected <b>154</b>, then the LRD <b>50</b> transfers <b>162</b> the data stored in the LRD location memory <b>123</b>. If the data transfer from LRD <b>50</b> to RIU <b>80</b> is not completed <b>163</b>, the LRD <b>50</b> looks for a signal <b>154</b> from the RIU <b>80</b>. If the LRD <b>50</b> finds the RIU signal again, data transfer is started again <b>162</b>. If the LRD <b>50</b> cannot find a signal form the RIU <b>154</b>, the LRD <b>50</b> checks to see if the set time since the last data transfer has expired <b>168</b>. If the time since the last data transfer has not expired <b>168</b>, then the LRD <b>50</b> continues to store locations <b>150</b>.</p>
    <p>If the time since the last data transfer has expired <b>168</b>, the LRD <b>50</b> displays a go to residence interface unit message <b>169</b> on the LRD display <b>51</b>. The LRD <b>50</b> then activates the piezo <b>60</b> audible alert <b>170</b>. The LRD <b>50</b> then checks to see if the piezo acknowledged button <b>59</b> has been pressed <b>171</b>. If the piezo acknowledged button <b>59</b> has not been pressed <b>171</b>, the LRD <b>50</b> checks to see if there is a signal <b>154</b> from the RIU <b>80</b>. If the piezo acknowledged button <b>59</b> has been pressed <b>171</b>, then the LRD <b>50</b> waits for a programmable interval <b>172</b> before checking to see if there is a signal <b>173</b> from the RIU <b>80</b>. If there is a signal <b>173</b> from the RIU <b>80</b>, then the LRD <b>50</b> transfers data <b>162</b> to the RIU <b>80</b>. If after notifying the subject to go to the RIU <b>169</b> and waiting for the programmed time interval <b>172</b> there is still no signal <b>173</b> from the RIU <b>80</b>, the violation is stored <b>174</b> in the LRD location memory <b>123</b> and the LRD <b>50</b> continues to listen for a signal <b>154</b> from the RIU <b>80</b>.</p>
    <p>After the LRD <b>50</b> transfers data <b>163</b> to the RIU <b>80</b>, the LRD <b>50</b> checks to see if there is any data from <b>164</b> the RIU <b>80</b>. If there is no data to be transferred from <b>164</b> the RIU <b>80</b>, the LRD <b>50</b> continues to store locations <b>150</b>. If there is data to be transferred from <b>164</b> the RIU <b>80</b>, the LRD <b>50</b> transfers the data <b>165</b>. The LRD <b>50</b> checks to see if the data transfer from the RIU <b>80</b> is complete <b>166</b>. If the data transfer is complete <b>166</b>, then the LRD <b>50</b> stores the data <b>167</b> in the appropriate LRD memories <b>123</b>,<b>127</b>. If the data transfer is not complete <b>166</b>, the LRD <b>50</b> will listen for a signal <b>154</b> from the RIU <b>80</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 8 is a flowchart of the method of operation for the RIU <b>80</b>. The RIU collects data from the LRD <b>50</b> and forwards that data to the central data base facility <b>16</b>. The RIU <b>80</b> stores commands and data from the central data base facility <b>16</b>. The commands and data from the central data base facility <b>16</b> can be program updates and data variable updates for either the RIU <b>80</b> or the LRD <b>50</b>. The RIU <b>80</b> will transfer any commands and data to the LRD <b>50</b>. The RIU <b>80</b> checks for tampers such as removing the RIU cover <b>101</b>, unplugging the residence phone line <b>15</b> or failing to respond to command messages on the RIU message display <b>113</b>. The RIU <b>80</b> performs these functions as an iterative process where the time interval for each iteration is programmable.</p>
    <p>The RIU <b>80</b> checks to see if the time interval since the last data transfer <b>180</b> between the RIU <b>80</b> and the central data base facility <b>16</b> has expired. If the time interval has expired <b>180</b> then the RIU <b>80</b> checks to see if there is any LRD <b>50</b> data or RIU <b>80</b> data stored in the RIU memory <b>144</b> to transfer <b>181</b>. If the RIU <b>80</b> has LRD <b>50</b> data stored in its memory <b>144</b> to be transferred <b>181</b>, then the RIU <b>80</b> checks to see if the phone line <b>15</b> is busy <b>182</b>. If the phone line <b>15</b> is not busy <b>182</b>, then the RIU <b>80</b> checks for a dial tone <b>188</b>. If there is no dial tone <b>188</b>, the RIU <b>80</b> stores a violation that the phone line <b>15</b> is out of order. If the dial tone is available <b>188</b>, the RIU <b>80</b> contacts <b>194</b> the central data base facility <b>16</b>. The RIU <b>80</b> transfers the stored data <b>193</b> to the central data base facility <b>16</b>. The RIU <b>80</b> then checks to see if the data transfer completed <b>192</b>. If the data transfer did not complete <b>192</b> then the RIU <b>80</b> checks to see if the phone line <b>15</b> is busy <b>182</b>. If the data transfer completed <b>192</b>, then the RIU <b>80</b> checks to see if is any data from <b>197</b> the central data base facility <b>16</b>. If the central data base facility <b>16</b> has data to send <b>197</b>, the RIU <b>80</b> transfers the data <b>198</b> and checks to see if the transfer completed <b>199</b>. If the transfer did not complete <b>199</b>, the RIU <b>80</b> checks for a dial tone <b>188</b>. If the data transfer completed <b>199</b>, the RIU checks for data <b>208</b> that is for the RIU <b>80</b> and/or the LRD <b>50</b>. If the data <b>208</b> is for the RIU <b>80</b>, then the RIU <b>80</b> stores the data <b>207</b> in the RIU memory <b>144</b>. If the transferred data <b>208</b> is for the LRD <b>50</b>, then the RIU <b>80</b> queues the data <b>209</b> for the next data transmission to the LRD <b>50</b>.</p>
    <p>If the RIU <b>80</b> finds that the phone line <b>15</b> is busy <b>182</b>, then the RIU <b>80</b> displays that it needs the phone line <b>183</b> on the RIU display <b>113</b> and activates alert tones <b>184</b> on the RIU speaker <b>106</b>. The RIU <b>80</b> then checks to see if the RIU yes response button <b>114</b> has been pressed <b>185</b>. If the RIU yes response button <b>114</b> has been pressed <b>185</b> the RIU <b>80</b> deactivates the alert tones <b>191</b> and checks to see if the phone line <b>15</b> is busy <b>182</b>. If the RIU yes response button <b>114</b> has not been pressed <b>185</b> the RIU <b>80</b> checks to see if the response time interval has expired <b>186</b>. If the response time interval has not expired <b>186</b> the RIU <b>80</b> checks to see if the phone line <b>15</b> is busy <b>182</b>. If the response time interval has expired <b>186</b> the RIU <b>80</b> grabs <b>187</b> the phone line <b>15</b>.</p>
    <p>If the time since the last data transfer to the central data base facility <b>16</b> has expired <b>180</b> and there is no LRD <b>50</b> data to transfer <b>181</b> to the central data base facility <b>16</b>, the RIU <b>80</b> will transmit a beacon signal and check if the LRD <b>50</b> is responding <b>190</b>. The RIU <b>80</b> will continue to transmit a beacon signal until there is a response <b>190</b> from the LRD <b>50</b>. If there is a response <b>190</b> from the LRD <b>50</b> then the RIU transfers the data <b>196</b> from the LRD <b>50</b>. The RIU <b>80</b> checks if the data transfer from the LRD <b>50</b> completed <b>195</b>. If data transfer is not complete <b>195</b> the RIU <b>80</b> transmits a beacon signal to see if the LRD <b>50</b> responds <b>200</b>. If the LRD <b>50</b> responds <b>200</b> the RIU <b>80</b> transfers the data <b>196</b> from the LRD <b>50</b>. If the LRD <b>50</b> does not respond <b>200</b> the RIU <b>80</b> displays need the location recording device <b>201</b> on the RIU display <b>113</b> and activates alert tones <b>202</b> on the RIU speaker <b>106</b>. The RIU <b>80</b> then checks to see if the RIU yes response button <b>114</b> has been pressed <b>203</b>. If the RIU yes response button <b>114</b> has been pressed <b>203</b> the RIU <b>80</b> deactivates the alert tones <b>206</b> and checks to see if the LRD <b>50</b> is responding <b>200</b>. If the RIU yes response button <b>114</b> has not been pressed <b>203</b> the RIU <b>80</b> checks to see if the response time interval has expired <b>204</b>. If the response time interval has not expired <b>204</b> the RIU <b>80</b> checks to see if the LRD <b>50</b> is responding <b>200</b>. If the response time interval has expired <b>204</b> the RIU <b>80</b> stores the violation <b>205</b> and checks if the time since the last data transfer to the central data base facility <b>16</b> has expired <b>180</b>.</p>
    <p>If the data transfer from the LRD <b>50</b> completed <b>195</b> the RIU <b>80</b> checks if there is data queued <b>210</b> for the LRD <b>50</b>. If there is data queued <b>210</b> for the LRD <b>50</b> the RIU <b>80</b> transfers the data <b>211</b> to the LRD <b>50</b>. The RIU <b>80</b> checks for data transfer complete <b>212</b>. If data transfer is not complete <b>212</b> the RIU <b>80</b> transmits a beacon signal to see if the LRD <b>50</b> responds <b>213</b>. If the LRD <b>50</b> responds <b>213</b> the RIU <b>80</b> transfers the data <b>211</b> from the LRD <b>50</b>. If the LRD <b>50</b> does not respond <b>213</b> the RIU <b>80</b> displays need the location recording device <b>214</b> on the RIU display <b>113</b> and activates alert tones <b>215</b> on the RIU speaker <b>106</b>. The RIU <b>80</b> then checks to see if the RIU yes response button <b>114</b> has been pressed <b>216</b>. If the RIU yes response button <b>114</b> has been pressed <b>216</b> the RIU <b>80</b> deactivates the alert tones <b>219</b> and checks to see if the LRD <b>50</b> is responding <b>213</b>. If the RIU yes response button <b>114</b> has not been pressed <b>216</b> the RIU <b>80</b> checks to see if the response time interval has expired <b>217</b>. If the response time interval has not expired <b>186</b> the RIU <b>80</b> checks to see if the LRD <b>50</b> is responding <b>213</b>. If the response time interval has expired <b>186</b> the RIU <b>80</b> stores the violation <b>218</b> and checks if the time since the last data transfer to the central data base facility <b>16</b> has expired <b>180</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 9 is a flowchart of the method of operation for the automated crime incident/subject location correlation. The automated crime incident/subject location correlation is a continuous process that reports either electronically to a query terminal <b>37</b>,<b>39</b> or by hardcopy fax or printout to either law enforcement or corrections/community supervision when a crime incident <b>2</b> is correlated with a subject's location <b>3</b>.</p>
    <p>The crime incident offender location correlation data base <b>1</b> is a real-time system that is continuously updated from;</p>
    <p>1) Law enforcement CAD systems <b>6</b> that provide crime incident data,</p>
    <p>2) Law enforcement RMS systems <b>8</b> that provide crime incident data,</p>
    <p>3) Corrections/community supervision offender location monitoring systems <b>220</b>,</p>
    <p>4) Corrections/community supervision offender population information systems <b>34</b>.</p>
    <p>The updates can either be submitted in batch mode as known in the art or real-time as known in the art. Batch mode submittals, also known in the art as synchronous since they are synchronized with times of day or number of submittals per day, determine when automated correlation can occur since batch mode submittal will occur after the event (either crime incident or offender location recording) has taken place. Real-time submittals, also known in the art as asynchronous since they occur immediately with no predetermined scheduling, determine the need for tables of pending correlation since real-time submittal will occur as the event (either crime incident or offender location recording) is taking place.</p>
    <p>CAD crime incident data <b>6</b> typically contains the following dispatch information;</p>
    <p>1) Dispatched officer(s) identification,</p>
    <p>2) Date/time of dispatch,</p>
    <p>3) Location of incident,</p>
    <p>4) Incident identifier,</p>
    <p>5) Type of incident code and</p>
    <p>6) Ancillary information</p>
    <p>RMS crime incident data <b>8</b> typically contains the following investigative information;</p>
    <p>1) Information from CAD systems (if a dispatch was involved),</p>
    <p>2) Incident identification code,</p>
    <p>3) Investigating officer(s) identification,</p>
    <p>4) Subsequent time/date/location information,</p>
    <p>5) Additional incident(s) information and</p>
    <p>6) Motus opperandi (criminal methods).</p>
    <p>Offender location monitoring systems <b>220</b> is a collection of methods of locating offenders;</p>
    <p>1) House arrest location monitoring systems <b>10</b> as is known in the art,</p>
    <p>2) Location recording using GPS <b>14</b> as described in this invention,</p>
    <p>3) Continuous location recording using GPS <b>18</b> as is known in the art,</p>
    <p>4) Continuous location recording using RF triangulation <b>22</b> as is known in the art,</p>
    <p>5) Voice recognition/caller identification location recording <b>26</b> as is known in the art and</p>
    <p>6) Mobile cellular triangulation location recording <b>30</b> as is known in the art.</p>
    <p>Offender location monitoring systems <b>220</b> typically contain the following information;</p>
    <p>1) Offender identification</p>
    <p>2) Date, time and location of an offender (random to continuous),</p>
    <p>3) Type of offender violations with date and time,</p>
    <p>4) Offender's corrections/community supervision officer(s) and</p>
    <p>5) Offender violation contact list(s) and response(s).</p>
    <p>Offender population information systems <b>34</b> typically contains the following information regarding the offender population under community supervision;</p>
    <p>1) Offender demographic data,</p>
    <p>2) Offender criminal history,</p>
    <p>3) Offender personal information,</p>
    <p>4) Offender employment information,</p>
    <p>5) Offender education information,</p>
    <p>6) Offender sentencing information,</p>
    <p>7) Digitized images and</p>
    <p>8) Associated victim information.</p>
    <p>None of the data from the sources described above is standardized, therefore the crime incident offender location correlation data base <b>1</b> must translate data types and formats to a standard internal data type and format, as known in the art, as it receives data (either by extraction or import as known in the art) from each unique system. The crime incident offender location correlation data base <b>1</b> must also translate from its internal standard data type and format to each law enforcement and corrections/community supervision agency's unique representation of data as it generates either electronic or hardcopy reports.</p>
    <p>The automated crime incident/subject location correlation is an iterative process that continuously performs correlation as data from CAD <b>7</b>, RMS <b>9</b>, IMS <b>34</b> and offender location monitoring systems <b>220</b> is received by the crime incident offender location correlation data base <b>1</b>. Each offender's data from an offender location monitoring system <b>220</b> is correlated against any violations of exclusion zone criteria <b>221</b> from offender sentencing data in IMS <b>34</b> and exclusion zone violations reported by the offender location monitoring system <b>220</b>. If exclusion zone violations are correlated <b>221</b> a table report is generated <b>222</b> for the law enforcement and/or corrections/community supervision agency(s). Each offender's data from an offender location monitoring system <b>220</b> is correlated against any violations of inclusion zone criteria <b>223</b> from offender sentencing data in IMS <b>34</b> and inclusion zone violations reported by the offender location monitoring system <b>220</b>. If inclusion zone violations are correlated <b>223</b> a table report is generated <b>224</b> for the law enforcement and/or corrections/community supervision agency(s).</p>
    <p>Each offender's data from an offender location monitoring system <b>220</b> is correlated against any crime incidents <b>225</b> from CAD <b>6</b> and RMS <b>8</b> systems. For offender locations that were outside the crime incident automated criteria boundaries, a table report of non-suspects is generated <b>226</b>. For offender locations that were inside the crime incident automated criteria boundaries, a table report of high probability suspects is generated <b>229</b>. For offenders whose location is unknown <b>225</b>, those offenders are correlated to see if those offender's locations are being recorded <b>227</b> by a location monitoring system <b>220</b>. For those offenders whose locations are not being monitored <b>227</b> at the time of the crime incident, a table report of offender suspects of unknown location is generated <b>228</b>. For the offenders whose locations are being monitored <b>227</b>, those offenders are correlated to see if location data has been updated <b>230</b> for those offenders for the time of the crime incident. For those offenders whose location data has not been updated <b>230</b> for the time of the crime incident, a table report of pending offender suspects <b>231</b> is generated. For those offenders whose location data has been updated <b>230</b> for the time of the crime incident but no location data is available, those offenders are correlated to see if the offender was intentionally violating by tampering <b>232</b> (i.e. not replacing/recharging batteries, not calling in, removing body-worn devices, etc.). For those offenders with tamper violations at the time of the crime incident, a table report of tamper violation offender suspects <b>223</b> is generated. For those offenders whose location data has been updated <b>230</b> for the time of the crime incident but no location data is available and no tamper violations were recorded <b>232</b> (i.e. equipment malfunction, between sample intervals for voice recognition/caller identification, etc.), a table report of low probability offender suspects <b>234</b> is generated.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 10 through 19 are flowcharts of the method of operation for structured queries submitted against the crime incident offender location correlation data base <b>1</b>. Structured queries support investigative crime incident/offender location correlation with variable criteria since automated crime incident/offender location correlation described in FIG. 9 must deal with finite criteria established at the time the automated correlation is generated. Subsequent investigative data may require changing one or more of the automated correlation criteria to support a broader investigative query due to discovery of additional crime incident data not available at the time when the automated correlation report for the crime incident was generated. Law enforcement and corrections/community supervision agency personnel use the query terminal <b>37</b>,<b>39</b> for structured queries and are hereinafter referred to as users.</p>
    <p>FIG. 10 is a flowchart of the method of operation for the query terminal <b>37</b>,<b>39</b> correlating a single crime incident with offender(s) locations based on the following criteria;</p>
    <p>1) Date or range of dates (ie. spanning midnight, time of crime incident could have occurred in a multiple day interval, etc.),</p>
    <p>2) Time period (i.e. the exact time covers multiple hours),</p>
    <p>3) Specific crime incident identification and</p>
    <p>4) Buffer distance around crime incident location (i.e. increased buffer area due to time period, offender's travel speed, etc.).</p>
    <p>The user is prompted for a date or range of dates <b>240</b>. No date entry assumes all dates. The user is prompted for a time period <b>241</b>. No time period entry assumes 24 hours for the date or range of dates. The user is prompted for a crime incident identification <b>242</b>. The user is prompted for a buffer distance <b>243</b> around the crime incident location. The user submits the structured query <b>244</b> to the crime incident offender location correlation data base <b>1</b>.</p>
    <p>Each offender's data from an offender location monitoring system <b>220</b> is correlated against the structured crime incident query criteria <b>245</b>. For those offenders that have location data that does not match the structured crime incident query criteria <b>245</b>, a table report of non-suspect offenders is generated <b>246</b>. For those offenders that have location data that does match the structured crime incident query criteria <b>245</b>, a table report of high suspect offenders is generated <b>247</b>.</p>
    <p>For offenders whose location is unknown during the date and or time for structured crime incident query criteria <b>245</b>, those offenders are correlated to see if those offender's locations are being recorded <b>248</b> by a location monitoring system <b>220</b>. For those offenders whose locations are not being monitored during the date and or time for structured crime incident query criteria <b>245</b>, a table report of offender suspects of unknown location is generated <b>249</b>. For the offenders whose locations are being monitored <b>248</b> during the date and or time for the structured crime incident query criteria <b>245</b>, those offenders are correlated to see if location data has been updated <b>250</b> for those offenders for the time of the crime incident. For those offenders whose location data has not been updated <b>250</b> for the time during the structured crime incident query criteria <b>245</b>, a table report of pending offender suspects <b>251</b> is generated. For those offenders whose location data has been updated <b>250</b> for the time during the structured crime incident query criteria <b>245</b> but no location data is available, those offenders are correlated to see if the offender was intentionally violating by tampering <b>252</b> (i.e. not replacing/recharging batteries, not calling in, removing body-worn devices, etc.). For those offenders with tamper violations <b>252</b> at the time during the structured crime incident query criteria <b>245</b>, a table report of tamper violation offender suspects <b>253</b> is generated. For those offenders whose location data has been updated <b>250</b> for the time during the structured crime incident query criteria <b>245</b> but no location data is available and no tamper violations were recorded <b>252</b> (i.e. equipment malfunction, between sample intervals for voice recognition/caller identification, etc.), a table report of low probability offender suspects <b>254</b> is generated.</p>
    <p>FIG. 11 is a flowchart of the method of operation for the query terminal <b>37</b>,<b>39</b> correlating multiple crime incidents with offender(s) locations based on the following criteria;</p>
    <p>1) For each crime incident, a date or range of dates (ie. spanning midnight, time of crime incident could have occurred in a multiple day interval, etc.),</p>
    <p>2) For each crime incident, a time period (i.e. the exact time covers multiple hours),</p>
    <p>3) For each crime incident, a specific crime incident identification and</p>
    <p>4) For each crime incident, a buffer distance around crime incident location (i.e. increased buffer area due to time period, offender's travel speed, etc.).</p>
    <p>The user is prompted for a date or range of dates <b>260</b> for each crime incident. No date entry assumes all dates. The user is prompted for a time period <b>261</b> for each crime incident. No time period entry assumes 24 hours for the date or range of dates. The user is prompted for each crime incident identification<b>262</b>. The user is prompted for a buffer distance <b>263</b> around the crime incident location. The user submits the structured query <b>264</b> to the crime incident offender location correlation data base <b>1</b>.</p>
    <p>Each offender's data from an offender location monitoring system <b>220</b> is correlated against the structured multiple crime incident query criteria <b>265</b>. For those offenders that have location data that does match more than one structured crime incident query criteria <b>265</b>, a table report of multiple crime incident suspect offenders is generated <b>266</b>.</p>
    <p>For offenders whose location does not correlate with more than one crime incident query criteria <b>265</b>, those offenders are correlated to see if those offender's locations are being recorded <b>267</b> by a location monitoring system <b>220</b>. For those offenders whose locations are not being monitored during the date and or time for structured multiple crime incident query criteria <b>265</b>, a table report of offender suspects of unknown location is generated <b>268</b>. For the offenders whose locations are being monitored <b>267</b> during the date and or time for the structured crime incident query criteria <b>245</b>, those offenders are correlated to see if location data has been updated <b>269</b> for those offenders for the time of multiple crime incidents. For those offenders whose location data has not been updated <b>269</b> for the time during the structured multiple crime incident query criteria <b>265</b>, a table report of pending offender suspects <b>270</b> is generated. For those offenders whose location data has been updated <b>269</b> for the time during the structured multiple crime incident query criteria <b>245</b> but no location data is available, those offenders are correlated to see if the offender was intentionally violating by tampering <b>271</b> (i.e. not replacing/recharging batteries, not calling in, removing body-worn devices, etc.). For those offenders with tamper violations <b>273</b> for multiple crime incidents, a table report of tamper violation offender suspects correlating to multiple crime incidents <b>275</b> is generated. For those offenders whose location data has been updated <b>269</b> for the time during the structured multiple crime incident query criteria <b>265</b> but no location data is available and no tamper violations were recorded <b>271</b> (i.e. equipment malfunction, between sample intervals for voice recognition/caller identification, etc.), a table report of low probability offender suspects <b>272</b> is generated. For those offenders with tamper violations at the time of one crime incident query criteria but not for multiple crime incidents <b>273</b>, a table report of violating offender suspects is generated for each crime incident <b>274</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 12 is a flowchart of the method of operation of the query terminal <b>37</b>,<b>39</b> providing the locations of a subject during a specified time period based on the following criteria;</p>
    <p>1) Date or range of dates (i.e. spanning midnight, time of crime incident could have occurred in a multiple day interval, etc.),</p>
    <p>2) Time period (i.e. the exact time covers multiple hours) and</p>
    <p>3) Offender identification and</p>
    <p>This query is only supported for offenders whose locations are being monitored. The user is prompted for a date or range of dates <b>280</b> for the offender location history. No date entry assumes all dates. The user is prompted for a time period <b>281</b> for the offender location history. No time period entry assumes 24 hours for the date or range of dates. The user is prompted for the offender identification <b>282</b>. The user submits the structured query <b>283</b> to the crime incident offender location correlation data base <b>1</b>.</p>
    <p>The offender's data from an offender location monitoring system <b>220</b> is correlated against the structured offender location query criteria <b>284</b>. For the times where offender locations are available <b>284</b> (i.e. the offender's locations are being monitored and location data is available) a map of offender locations <b>285</b> is generated. For the times where offender locations are not available <b>284</b>, the offender is correlated to see if location data has been updated <b>286</b>. For those time periods where offender location data has not been updated <b>286</b>, a table report of pending offender locations during specified times <b>287</b> is generated. For the times when the offender's location data has been updated <b>286</b> but no location data is available, those times are correlated to see if the offender was intentionally violating by tampering <b>288</b> (i.e. not replacing/recharging batteries, not calling in, removing body-worn devices, etc.). For those times with tamper violations <b>288</b> for the time query criteria <b>284</b>, a table report of offender tamper violation times <b>289</b> is generated.

    <p>FIG. 13 is a flowchart of the method of operation of the query terminal <b>37</b>,<b>39</b> providing exclusion zone violations of a subject during a specified time period based on the following criteria;</p>
    <p>1) Date or range of dates (i.e. spanning midnight, time of crime incident could have occurred in a multiple day interval, etc.),</p>
    <p>2) Time period (i.e. the exact time covers multiple hours),</p>
    <p>3) Offender identification,</p>
    <p>4) Exclusion location,</p>
    <p>5) Buffer distance and</p>
    <p>6) Loiter time.</p>
    <p>This query is only supported for offenders whose locations are being monitored. The user is prompted for a date or range of dates <b>290</b> for the offender exclusion zone violation history. No date entry assumes all dates. The user is prompted for a time period <b>291</b> for the offender exclusion zone violation history. No time period entry assumes 24 hours for the date or range of dates. The user is prompted for the offender identification <b>292</b>. The user is prompted for the exclusion location <b>293</b> by U.S. Postal Service address or by selecting a location on a screen map display. The user is prompted for a buffer distance <b>294</b> surrounding the exclusion location thereby creating a zone. The user is prompted for a loiter time <b>296</b> since passing through an exclusion zone is permitted but loitering is not (i.e. pedophile driving by a school on the way to work). The user submits the structured query <b>283</b> to the crime incident offender location correlation data base <b>1</b>.</p>
    <p>The offender's data from an offender location monitoring system <b>220</b> is correlated against the structured offender exclusion zone violation query criteria <b>298</b>. For the times where offender locations are available for exclusion zone correlation <b>298</b> (i.e. the offender's locations are being monitored and location data is available) a table report of offender exclusion zone violations <b>299</b> is generated for all exclusion zone violations that correlate with the structured query. For the times where offender locations are not available for exclusion zone correlation <b>298</b>, the offender is correlated to see if location data has been updated <b>300</b>. For those time periods where offender location data has not been updated <b>300</b>, a table report of pending offender exclusion zone compliance during specified times <b>310</b> is generated. For the times when the offender's location data has been updated <b>300</b> but no location data is available, those times are correlated to see if the offender was intentionally violating by tampering <b>320</b> (i.e. not replacing/recharging batteries, not calling in, removing body-worn devices, etc.). For those times with tamper violations <b>320</b> for the exclusion zone query criteria <b>298</b>, a table report of offender tamper violation times <b>322</b> is generated. For those times where location data has been updated <b>300</b> but no location data is available and no tamper violations were recorded <b>320</b> (i.e. equipment malfunction, between sample intervals for voice recognition/caller identification, etc.), a table report for unknown compliance <b>321</b> is generated.</p>
