Each of the computer modules has a processing unit, a main memory coupled to the processing unit, a graphics controller coupled to the processing unit, and a mass storage device coupled to the processing unit. Each of the computer modules is substantially similar in design to each other to provide independent processing of each of the computer modules in the computer system."/><meta property="og:title" content="Patent US7363416 - Computer system utilizing multiple computer modules with password protection"/><meta property="og:type" content="book"/><meta property="og:site_name" content="Google Books"/><meta property="og:image" content="http://www.google.com/patents?id=&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1"/><link rel="image_src" href="http://www.google.com/patents?id=&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1"/><script>(function(){try{var aa=function(a,b,c,d){d=d||{};d._sn=["cfg",b,c].join(".");window.gbar.logger.ml(a,d)};var g=window.gbar=window.gbar||{},l=window.gbar.i=window.gbar.i||{},m={},n;function _tvn(a,b){var c=parseInt(a,10);return isNaN(c)?b:c}function _tvf(a,b){var c=parseFloat(a);return isNaN(c)?b:c}function _tvv(a){return!!a}function p(a,b,c){(c||g)[a]=b}g.bv={n:_tvn("2",0),r:"",f:".67.",e:"0",m:_tvn("0",1)};

<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">The present invention relates to computing devices. More particularly, the present invention provides a system including a plurality of computer modules that can independently operate to provide backup capability, dual processing, and the like. Merely by way of example, the present invention is applied to a modular computing environment for desk top computers, but it will be recognized that the invention has a much wider range of applicability. It can be applied to a server as well as other portable or modular computing applications.</p>
  <p num="p-0004">Many desktop or personal computers, which are commonly termed PCs, have been around and used for over ten years. The PCs often come with state-of-art microprocessors such as the Intel Pentium™ microprocessor chips. They also include a hard or fixed disk drive such as memory in the giga-bit range. Additionally, the PCs often include a random access memory integrated circuit device such as a dynamic random access memory device, which is commonly termed DRAM. The DRAM devices now provide up to millions of memory cells (i.e., mega-bit) on a single slice of silicon. PCs also include a high resolution display such as cathode ray tubes or CRTs. In most cases, the CRTs are at least 15 inches or 17 inches or 20 inches in diameter. High resolution flat panel displays are also used with PCs.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">Many external or peripheral devices can be used with the PCs. Among others, these peripheral devices include mass storage devices such as a Zip™ Drive product sold by Iomega Corporation of Utah. Other storage devices include external hard drives, tape drives, and others. Additional devices include communication devices such as a modem, which can be used to link the PC to a wide area network of computers such as the Internet. Furthermore, the PC can include output devices such as a printer and other output means. Moreover, the PC can include special audio output devices such as speakers the like.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">PCs also have easy to use keyboards, mouse input devices, and the like. The keyboard is generally configured similar to a typewriter format. The keyboard also has the length and width for easily inputting information by way of keys to the computer. The mouse also has a sufficient size and shape to easily move a curser on the display from one location to another location.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">Other types of computing devices include portable computing devices such as “laptop” computers and the like. Although somewhat successful, laptop computers have many limitations. These computing devices have poor display technology. In fact, these devices often have a smaller flat panel display that has poor viewing characteristics. Additionally, these devices also have poor input devices such as smaller keyboards and the like. Furthermore, these devices have limited common platforms to transfer information to and from these devices and other devices such as PCs.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">Up to now, there has been little common ground between these platforms including the PCs and laptops in terms of upgrading, ease-of-use, cost, performance, and the like. Many differences between these platforms, probably somewhat intentional, has benefited computer manufacturers at the cost of consumers. A drawback to having two separate computers is that the user must often purchase both the desktop and laptop to have “total” computing power, where the desktop serves as a “regular” computer and the laptop serves as a “portable” computer. Purchasing both computers is often costly and runs “thousands” of dollars. The user also wastes a significant amount of time transferring software and data between the two types of computers. For example, the user must often couple the portable computer to a local area network (i.e., LAN), to a serial port with a modem and then manually transfer over files and data between the desktop and the portable computer. Alternatively, the user often must use floppy disks to “zip” up files and programs that exceed the storage capacity of conventional floppy disks, and transfer the floppy disk data manually.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">Another drawback with the current model of separate portable and desktop computer is that the user has to spend money to buy components and peripherals the are duplicated in at least one of these computers. For example, both the desktop and portable computers typically include hard disk drives, floppy drives, CD-ROMs, computer memory, host processors, graphics accelerators, and the like. Because program software and supporting programs generally must be installed upon both hard drives in order for the user to operate programs on the road and in the office, hard disk space is often wasted.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">One approach to reduce some of these drawbacks has been the use of a docking station with a portable computer. Here, the user has the portable computer for “on the road” use and a docking station that houses the portable computer for office use.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">Similar to separate desktop and portable computers, there is no commonality between two desktop computers. To date, most personal computers are constructed with a single motherboard that provides connection for CPU and other components in the computer. Dual CPU systems have been available through Intel's slot <b>1</b> architecture. For example, two Pentium II cartridges can be plugged into two “slot <b>1</b>” card slots on a motherboard to form a Dual-processor system. The two CPU's share a common host bus that connects to the rest of the system, e.g. main memory, hard disk drive, graphics subsystem, and others. Dual CPU systems have the advantage of increased CPU performance for the whole system. Adding a CPU cartridge requires no change in operating systems and application software. However, dual CPU systems may suffer limited performance improvement if memory or disk drive bandwidth becomes the limiting factor. Also, dual CPU systems have to time-share the processing unit in running multiple applications. CPU performance improvement efficiency also depends on software coding structure. Dual CPU systems provide no hardware redundancy to help fault tolerance. In running multiple applications, memory and disk drive data throughput will become the limiting factor in improving performance with multi-processor systems.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">The present invention generally relates to computer interfaces. More specifically, the present invention relates to an interface channel that interfaces two computer interface buses that operate under protocols that are different from that used by the interface channel.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">Interfaces coupling two independent computer buses are well known in the art. A block diagram of a computer system utilizing such a prior art interface is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a primary peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus <b>505</b> of a notebook PC <b>500</b> is coupled to a secondary PCI bus <b>555</b> in a docking system <b>550</b> (also referred to as docking station <b>550</b>) through high pin count connectors <b>501</b> and <b>502</b>, which are normally mating connectors. The high pin count connectors <b>501</b> and <b>502</b> contain a sufficiently large number of pins so as to carry PCI bus signals between the two PCI buses without any translation. The main purpose for interfacing the two independent PCI buses is to allow transactions to occur between a master on one PCI bus and a target on the other PCI bus. The interface between these two independent PCI buses additionally includes an optional PCI to PCI bridge <b>560</b>, located in the docking station <b>550</b>, to expand the add on capability in docking station <b>550</b>. The bridge <b>560</b> creates a new bus number for devices behind the bridge <b>560</b> so that they are not on the same bus number as other devices in the system thus increasing the add on capability in the docking station <b>550</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">An interface such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> provides an adequate interface between the primary and secondary PCI buses. However, the interface is limited in a number of ways. The interface transfers signals between the primary and secondary PCI buses using the protocols of a PCI bus. Consequently, the interface is subject to the limitations under which PCI buses operate. One such limitation is the fact that PCI buses are not cable friendly. The cable friendliness of the interface was not a major concern in the prior art. However, in the context of the computer system of the present invention, which is described in the present inventor's (William W.Y. Chu's) application for “Personal Computer Peripheral Console With Attached Computer Module” filed concurrently with the present application on Sep. 8, 1998 and incorporated herein by reference, a cable friendly interface is desired for interfacing an attached computer module (ACM) and a peripheral console of the present invention. Furthermore, as a result of operating by PCI protocols, the prior art interface includes a very large number of signal channels with a corresponding large number of conductive lines (and a similarly large number of pins in the connectors of the interface) that are commensurate in number with the number of signal lines in the PCI buses which it interfaces. One disadvantage of an interface having a relatively large number of conductive lines and pins is that it costs more than one that uses a fewer number of conductive lines and pins. Additionally, an interface having a large number of conductive lines is bulkier and more cumbersome to handle. Finally, a relatively large number of signal channels in the interface renders the option of using differential voltage signals less viable because a differential voltage signal method would require duplicating a large number of signal lines. It is desirable to use a low voltage differential signal (LVDS) channel in the computer system of the present invention because an LVDS channel is more cable friendly, faster, consumes less power, and generates less noise, including electromagnetic interferences (EMI), than a PCI channel. The term LVDS is herein used to generically refer to low voltage differential signals and is not intended to be limited to any particular type of LVDS technology.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">Thus, what is needed are computer systems that can have multiple computer modules. Each computer module has dedicated memory and disk drive, and can operate independently.</p>

  <p num="p-0019">Numerous benefits are achieved using the present invention over previously existing techniques. In one embodiment, the invention provides improved processing and maintenance features. The invention can also provide increased CPU performance for the whole system. The invention also can be implemented without changes in operating system and application software. The present invention is also implemented using conventional technologies that can be provided in the present computer system in an easy and efficient manner.</p>
  <p num="p-0020">In another embodiment, the invention provides at least two users to share the same modular desktop system. Each user operates on a different computer module. The other peripheral devices, i.e. CDROM, printer, DSL connection, etc. can be shared. This provides lower system cost, less desktop space and more efficiency. Depending upon the embodiment, one or more of these benefits can be available. These and other advantages or benefits are described throughout the present specification and are described more particularly below.</p>
  <p num="p-0021">In still further embodiments, the present invention provides methods of using multiple computer modules.</p>
  <p num="p-0022">The present invention encompasses an apparatus for bridging a first computer interface bus and a second computer interface bus, where each of the first and second computer interface buses have a number of parallel multiplexed address/data bus lines and operate at a clock speed in a predetermined clock speed range having a minimum clock speed and a maximum clock speed. The apparatus comprises an interface channel having a clock line and a plurality of bit lines for transmitting bits; a first interface controller coupled to the first computer interface bus and to the interface channel to encode first control signals from the first computer interface bus into first control bits to be transmitted on the interface channel and to decode second control bits received from the interface channel into second control signals to be transmitted to the first computer interface bus; and a second interface controller coupled to the interface channel and the second computer interface bus to decode the first control bits from the interface channel into third control signals to be transmitted on the second computer interface bus and to encode fourth control signals from the second computer interface bus into the second control bits to be transmitted on the interface channel.</p>
  <p num="p-0023">In one embodiment, the first and second interface controllers comprise a host interface controller (HIC) and a peripheral interface controller (PIC), respectively, the first and second computer interface buses comprise a primary PCI and a secondary PCI bus, respectively, and the interface channel comprises an LVDS channel.</p>
  <p num="p-0024">The present invention overcomes the aforementioned disadvantages of the prior art by interfacing two PCI or PCI-like buses using a non-PCI or non-PCI-like channel. In the present invention, PCI control signals are encoded into control bits and the control bits, rather than the control signals that they represent, are transmitted on the interface channel. At the receiving end, the control bits representing control signals are decoded back into PCI control signals prior to being transmitted to the intended PCI bus.</p>
  <p num="p-0025">The fact that control bits rather than control signals are transmitted on the interface channel allows using a smaller number of signal channels and a correspondingly small number of conductive lines in the interface channel than would otherwise be possible. This is because the control bits can be more easily multiplexed at one end of the interface channel and recovered at the other end than control signals. This relatively small number of signal channels used in the interface channel allows using LVDS channels for the interface. As mentioned above, an LVDS channel is more cable friendly, faster, consumes less power, and generates less noise than a PCI bus channel, which is used in the prior art to interface two PCI buses. Therefore, the present invention advantageously uses an LVDS channel for the hereto unused purpose of interfacing PCI or PCI-like buses. The relatively smaller number of signal channels in the interface also allows using connectors having smaller pins counts. As mentioned above an interface having a smaller number of signal channels and, therefore, a smaller number of conductive lines is less bulky and less expensive than one having a larger number of signal channels. Similarly, connectors having a smaller number of pins are also less expensive and less bulky than connectors having a larger number of pins.</p>
  <p num="p-0026">In one embodiment, the present invention encompasses an apparatus for bridging a first computer interface bus and a second computer interface bus, in a microprocessor based computer system where each of the first and second computer interface buses have a number of parallel multiplexed address/data bus lines and operate at a clock speed in a predetermined clock speed range having a minimum clock speed and a maximum clock speed. The apparatus comprises an interface channel having a clock channel and a plurality of bit channels for transmitting bits; a first interface controller coupled to the first computer interface bus and to the interface channel to encode first control signals from the first computer interface bus into first control bits to be transmitted on the interface channel and to decode second control bits received from the interface channel into second control signals to be transmitted to the first computer interface bus; and a second interface controller coupled to the interface channel and the second computer interface bus to decode the first control bits from the interface channel into third control signals to be transmitted on the second computer interface bus and to encode fourth control signals from the second computer interface bus into the second control bits to be transmitted on the interface channel.</p>
  <p num="p-0027">In one embodiment, the first and second interface controllers comprise a host interface controller (HIC) and a peripheral interface controller (PIC), respectively, the first and second computer interface buses comprise a primary PCI and a secondary PCI bus, respectively, and the interface channel comprises an LVDS channel.</p>
  <p num="p-0028">In a preferred embodiment, the interface channel has a plurality of serial bit channels numbering fewer than the number of parallel bus lines in each of the PCI buses and operates at a clock speed higher than the clock speed at which any of the bus lines operates. More specifically, the interface channel includes two sets of unidirectional serial bit channels which transmit data in opposite directions such that one set of bit channels transmits serial bits from the HIC to the PIC while the other set transmits serial bits from the PIC to the HIC. For each cycle of the PCI clock, each bit channel of the interface channel transmits a packet of serial bits.</p>
  <p num="p-0029">The HIC and PIC each include a bus controller to interface with the first and second computer interface buses, respectively, and to manage transactions that occur therewith. The HIC and PIC also include a translator coupled to the bus controller to encode control signals from the first and second computer interface buses, respectively, into control bits and to decode control bits from the interface channel into control signals. Additionally, the HIC and PIC each include a transmitter and a receiver coupled to the translator. The transmitter converts parallel bits into serial bits and transmits the serial bits to the interface channel. The receiver receives serial bits from the interface channel and converts them into parallel bits.</p>
  <p num="p-0030">According to the present invention, a technique including a method and device for securing a computer module using a password in a computer system is provided. In an exemplary embodiment, the present invention provides a security system for an attached computer module “ACM”). In an embodiment, the ACM inserts into a Computer Module Bay (CMB) within a peripheral console to form a functional computer.</p>
  <p num="p-0031">In a specific embodiment, the present invention provides a computer module. The computer module has an enclosure that is insertable into a console. The module also has a central processing unit (i.e., integrated circuit chip) in the enclosure. The module has a hard disk drive in the enclosure, where the hard disk drive is coupled to the central processing unit. The module further has a programmable memory device in the enclosure, where the programmable memory device can be configurable to store a password for preventing a possibility of unauthorized use of the hard disk drive and/or other module elements. The stored password can be any suitable key strokes that a user can change from time to time. In a further embodiment, the present invention provides a permanent password or user identification code stored in flash memory, which also can be in the processing unit, or other integrated circuit element. The permanent password or user identification code is designed to provide a permanent “finger print” on the attached computer module.</p>
  <p num="p-0032">In a specific embodiment, the present invention provides a variety of methods. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for operating a computer system such as a modular computer system and others. The method includes inserting an attached computer module “ACM”) into a bay of a modular computer system. The ACM has a microprocessor unit (e.g., microcontroller, microprocessor) coupled to a mass memory storage device (e.g., hard disk). The method also includes applying power to the computer system and the ACM to execute a security program, which is stored in the mass memory storage device. The method also includes prompting for a user password from a user on a display (e.g., flat panel, CRT). In a further embodiment, the present method includes a step of reading a permanent password or user identification code stored in flash memory, or other integrated circuit element. The permanent password or user identification code provides a permanent finger print on the attached computer module. The present invention includes a variety of these methods that can be implemented in computer codes, for example, as well as hardware.</p>
  <p num="p-0033">Numerous benefits are achieved using the present invention over previously existing techniques. The present invention provides mechanical and electrical security systems to prevent theft or unauthorized use of the computer system in a specific embodiment. Additionally, the present invention substantially prevents accidental removal of the ACM from the console. In some embodiments, the present invention prevents illegal or unauthorized use during transit. The present invention is also implemented using conventional technologies that can be provided in the present computer system in an easy and efficient manner. Depending upon the embodiment, one or more of these benefits can be available.

In an exemplary embodiment, the present invention provides a system including a plurality of computer modules that can independently operate to provide backup capability, dual processing, and the like.</p>
  <p num="p-0054"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a simplified diagram of a computer system <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. This diagram is merely an illustration and should not limit the scope of the claims herein. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives. The computer system <b>100</b> includes an attached computer module (i.e., ACM) <b>113</b>, a desktop console <b>101</b>, among other elements. The computer system also has another ACM module <b>117</b>. Each ACM module has a respective slot <b>121</b>, <b>119</b>, which mechanically houses and electrically couples each ACM to the computer console. Also shown is a display <b>111</b>, which connects to the console. Additionally, keyboard <b>109</b> and mouse <b>115</b> are also shown. A second display <b>102</b>, keyboard <b>105</b>, and mouse <b>107</b> can be coupled to the console in some optional embodiments to allow more than one user to operate the computer system. The computer system is modular and has a variety of components that are removable. Some of these components (or modules) can be used in different computers, workstations, computerized television sets, and portable or laptop units.</p>
  <p num="p-0055">In the present embodiment, each ACM <b>113</b> includes computer components, as will be described below, including a central processing unit “CPU”), IDE controller, hard disk drive, computer memory, and the like. The computer module bay (i.e., CMB) <b>121</b> is an opening or slot in the desktop console. The CMB houses the ACM and provides communication to and from the ACM. The CMB also provides mechanical protection and support to the ACM. The CMB has a mechanical alignment mechanism for mating a portion of the ACM to the console. The CMB further has thermal heat dissipation sinks, electrical connection mechanisms, and the like. Some details of the ACM can be found in co-pending patent application Ser. Nos. 09/149,882 and 09/149,548 filed Sep. 8, 1998, commonly assigned, and hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">In a specific embodiment, the present multiple computer module system has a peripheral console that has two or more computer bays that can receive a removable computer module or ACM. Multiple computer module system can function as a personal computer with only one ACM and the peripheral console. The second and additional ACM can be added later to increase overall system performance and reliability. The ACM operates independently as self-contained computer, communicates with each other through a high-speed serial communication and share most peripheral devices within the peripheral console. Each ACM controls its independent graphics subsystem and drives separate video output signals. A practical implementation is a dual ACM system. In a dual ACM system, two monitors can be used to display the two ACMs' graphics outputs at the same time. For a single monitor, a RGB switch is used to switch between the video outputs of the two ACMs and can be controlled by a command from the user. Similarly, input devices (i.e. keyboard and mouse) are switched between the two computer systems with a command from the user. Command from the user can be in the form of either a dedicated key on the keyboard or a special icon on the screen that the mouse can click on.</p>
  <p num="p-0057">In most embodiments, the ACM includes an enclosure such as the one described with the following components, which should not be limiting:
</p> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0057">1) A CPU with cache memory;</li> <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0058">2) Core logic device or means;</li> <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0059">3) Main memory;</li> <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0060">4) A single primary Hard Disk Drive “HDD”) that has a security program;</li> <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0061">5) Flash memory with system BIOS and programmable user password;</li> <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0062">6) Operating System, application software, data files on primary HDD;</li> <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0063">7) An interface device and connectors to peripheral console;</li> <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0064">8) A software controllable mechanical lock, lock control means, and other accessories.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p num="p-0058">The ACM connects to a peripheral console with power supply, a display device, an input device, and other elements. Some details of these elements with the present system are described in more detail below. In a dual ACM system, the primary ACM can connect directly to the peripheral board in the peripheral console. The second ACM can connect either directly or indirectly to the peripheral board. For indirect connection, a receptacle board is added to allow a cable connection to the peripheral board. This is to facilitate the mechanical positioning of the second ACM inside the computer chassis. The receptacle board approach can even be used for the primary ACM if a high bandwidth peripheral bus, e.g. PCI Bus, is not connected from the primary ACM to the peripheral board.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">The shared peripheral console has a chassis and a motherboard that connects the following devices:
</p> <ul> <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0067">1) Input means, e.g. keyboard and mouse,</li> <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0068">2) Display means, e.g. RGB monitor,</li> <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0069">3) Add-on means, e.g. PCI add-on slots,</li> <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0070">4) Two Computer Module Bays (CMB) with connectors to two ACMs,</li> <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0071">5) A serial communication Hub controller that interfaces to serial communication controller of both ACMs,</li> <li id="ul0004-0006" num="0072">6) Shared storage subsystem, e.g. Floppy drive, CDROM drive, DVD drive, or 2nd Hard Drive,</li> <li id="ul0004-0007" num="0073">7) Communication device, e.g. modem,</li> <li id="ul0004-0008" num="0074">8) Power supply, and others.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p num="p-0060">The computer bay is an opening in the peripheral console that receives an ACM. CMB provides mechanical protection to ACM, mechanical alignment for connector mating, mechanical locking system to prevent theft and accidental removal, and connectors at the end of the opening for connecting to ACM. The interface bus between ACM and the peripheral console has a video bus, peripheral connections, serial communication connection, control signals and power connection. Video bus includes video output of graphics devices, i.e. analog RGB and control signals for monitor. Power connection supplies the power for ACM.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">An implementation of peripheral sharing is the use of Ethernet controllers to bridge the communication between the two ACMs. Some of the peripheral devices residing in the peripheral console are shown in the simplified diagram of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As shown, the diagram is merely an illustration which should not limit the scope of the claims herein. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many other variations, alternatives, and modifications. As shown, a primary ACM <b>203</b> is connected to PCI peripheral devices in the peripheral console through the PCI bus <b>225</b> that passes through the connection between primary ACM <b>203</b> and peripheral console <b>201</b>. As shown, ACM has a CPU module <b>207</b> coupled to the PCI bus through a North Bridge <b>211</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0062">The CPU module can use a suitable microprocessing unit, microcontroller, digital signal processor, and the like. In a specific embodiment, the CPU module uses, for example, a 400 MHz Pentium II microprocessor module from Intel Corporation and like microprocessors from AMD Corporation, Cyrix Corporation (now National Semiconductor Corporation), and others. In other aspects, the microprocessor can be one such as the Compaq Computer Corporation Alpha Chip, Apple Computer Corporation PowerPC G3 processor, and the like. Further, higher speed processors are contemplated in other embodiments as technology increases in the future.</p>
  <p num="p-0063">In the CPU module, peripheral controller <b>213</b> is coupled to BIOS/flash memory <b>217</b>. Additionally, the peripheral controller is coupled to a clock control logic, a configuration signal, and a peripheral bus. The ACM has the hard drive module <b>215</b>. Among other elements, the ACM includes north bridge <b>215</b>, graphics subsystem <b>223</b> (e.g., graphics accelerator, graphics memory), an IDE controller, and other components. Adjacent to and in parallel alignment with the hard drive module <b>215</b> is the PCI bus. In a specific embodiment, North Bridge unit <b>211</b> often couples to a computer memory <b>209</b>, to the graphics subsystem, and to the peripheral controller via the PCI bus. Graphics subsystem typically couples to a graphics memory, and other elements. IDE controller generally supports and provides timing signals necessary for the IDE bus. In the present embodiment, the IDE controller is embodied as part of a P114XE controller from Intel, for example. Other types of buses than IDE are contemplated, for example EIDE, SCSI, 1394, and the like in alternative embodiments of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0064">The hard drive module or mass storage unit <b>215</b> typically includes a computer operating system, application software program files, data files, and the like. In a specific embodiment, the computer operating system may be the Windows98 operating system from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond Wash. Other operating systems, such as WindowsNT, MacOS8, Unix, and the like are also contemplated in alternative embodiments of the present invention. Further, some typical application software programs can include Office98 by Microsoft Corporation, Corel Perfect Suite by Corel, and others. Hard disk module <b>215</b> includes a hard disk drive. The hard disk drive, however, can also be replaced by removable hard disk drives, read/write CD ROMs, flash memory, floppy disk drives, and the like. A small form factor, for example 2.5″, is currently contemplated, however, other form factors, such as PC card, and the like are also contemplated. Mass storage unit <b>240</b> may also support other interfaces than IDE.</p>
  <p num="p-0065">Among other features, the computer system includes an ACM with security protection.</p>
  <p num="p-0066">The ACM also has a network controller, which can be an Ethernet controller <b>219</b>, which is coupled to the North Bridge through the PCI bus. The North Bridge is coupled to the CPU. The Ethernet controller can be a 10/100 Base, such as Intel's 82559 or the like. Other types of network connection devices can also be used. For example, the invention can use Gbit Ethernet 1394, and USB 2.0. The network controller couples to a hub <b>233</b> in the console, which includes shared peripheral system <b>201</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0067">Also shown is the second ACM <b>205</b>. The second ACM has the same or similar components as the first ACM. Here, like reference numerals have been used for easy cross-referencing, but is not intended to be limiting. In some embodiments, the secondary ACM is not connected to the PCI bus in the peripheral console directly. The secondary ACM <b>219</b> accesses peripheral devices controlled by the primary ACM through the Ethernet connection to the primary ACM, e.g. CD-ROM, or PCI modem. The implementation is not restricted to Ethernet serial communication and can use other high-speed serial communication such as USB 2.0, and 1394. The Ethernet hub is coupled to an external output port <b>235</b>, which connects to an external network.</p>
  <p num="p-0068">The primary hard disk drive in each ACM can be accessed by the other ACM as sharable hard drive through the Ethernet connection. This allows the easy sharing of files between the two independent computer modules. The Ethernet Hub Controller provides the high-speed communication function between the two computer modules. Ethernet data bandwidth of 100 Mbit/sec allows fast data communication between the two computer modules. The secondary ACM access peripheral devices of the primary ACM through the network connection provided by Ethernet link. The operating system, e.g. Windows 98, provides the sharing of resources between the two ACMs. In some embodiments, critical data in one ACM can be backup into the other ACM.</p>
  <p num="p-0069">The Ethernet hub also couples to PCI bus <b>239</b>, which connects to PCI devices <b>241</b>, <b>243</b>, e.g., modem, SCSI controller. A flash memory <b>242</b> can also be coupled to the PCI bus. The flash memory can store passwords and security information, such as those implementations described in U.S. Ser. No. 09/183,493, which is commonly owned, and hereby incorporated by reference. The hub <b>233</b> also couples to an I/O control <b>237</b>, which connects to keyboard/mouse switch <b>245</b>, which couples to keyboard/mouse <b>247</b>. Optionally, the keyboard/mouse switch also couples to a second keyboard/house <b>259</b> via PS<b>2</b> or USB signal line <b>251</b>. The keyboard/mouse switch has at least a first state and a second state, which allow operation of respectively multiple keyboards or a single keyboard. The switch also couples to each I/O controller <b>221</b> in each ACM via lines <b>253</b>, <b>255</b>. The I/O control <b>237</b> also couples to an RGB switch <b>257</b>, which allows video signals to pass to the first monitor <b>259</b>. Alternatively, the RGB switch couples to a second monitor <b>261</b>. The RGB switch includes analog video switches such as MAXIM's MAX4545.</p>
  <p num="p-0070">The peripheral system <b>201</b> also has an independent power supply <b>231</b> for each ACM. Each power supply provides power to each ACM. As merely an example, the power supply is a MICRO ATX 150W made by ENLIGHT, but can be others. The power supply is connected or coupled to each ACM through a separate line, for example. The independent power supply allows for independent operation of each ACM in some embodiments.</p>
  <p num="p-0071">The above embodiments are described generally in terms of hardware and software. It will be recognized, however, that the functionality of the hardware can be further combined or even separated. The functionality of the software can also be further combined or even separated. Hardware can be replaced, at times, with software. Software can be replaced, at times, with hardware. Accordingly, the present embodiments should not be construed as limiting the scope of the claims here. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives.</p>

Like reference numerals are used in this FIG. as the previous FIGS. for easy referencing, but are not intended to be limiting. As shown, each ACM includes common elements as the previous FIG. A primary ACM <b>203</b> is connected to PCI peripheral devices in the peripheral console through the PCI bus <b>225</b> that passes through the connection between primary ACM <b>203</b> and peripheral console <b>201</b>. As shown, ACM has a CPU module <b>207</b> coupled to the PCI bus through a North Bridge <b>211</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0073">The CPU module can use a suitable microprocessing unit, microcontroller, digital signal processor, and the like. In a specific embodiment, the CPU module uses, for example, a 400 MHz Pentium II microprocessor module from Intel Corporation and like microprocessors from AMD Corporation, Cyrix Corporation (now National Semiconductor Corporation), and others. In other aspects, the microprocessor can be one such as the Compaq Computer Corporation Alpha Chip, Apple Computer Corporation PowerPC G3 processor, and the like. Further, higher speed processors are contemplated in other embodiments as technology increases in the future.</p>
  <p num="p-0074">In the CPU module, peripheral controller <b>213</b> is coupled to BIOS/flash memory <b>217</b>. Additionally, the peripheral controller is coupled to a clock control logic, a configuration signal, and a peripheral bus. The ACM has the hard drive module <b>215</b>. Among other elements, the ACM includes north bridge <b>215</b>, graphics subsystem <b>223</b> (e.g., graphics accelerator, graphics memory), an IDE controller, and other components. Adjacent to and in parallel alignment with the hard drive module <b>215</b> is the PCI bus. In a specific embodiment, North Bridge unit <b>211</b> often couples to a computer memory <b>209</b>, to the graphics subsystem, and to the peripheral controller via the PCI bus. Graphics subsystem typically couples to a graphics memory, and other elements. IDE controller generally supports and provides timing signals necessary for the IDE bus. In the present embodiment, the IDE controller is embodied as part of a P114XE controller from Intel, for example. Other types of buses than IDE are contemplated, for example EIDE, SCSI, 1394, and the like in alternative embodiments of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0075">The hard drive module or mass storage unit <b>215</b> typically includes a computer operating system, application software program files, data files, and the like. In a specific embodiment, the computer operating system may be the Windows98 operating system from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond Wash. Other operating systems, such as WindowsNT, MacOS8, Unix, and the like are also contemplated in alternative embodiments of the present invention. Further, some typical application software programs can include Office98 by Microsoft Corporation, Corel Perfect Suite by Corel, and others. Hard disk module <b>215</b> includes a hard disk drive. The hard disk drive, however, can also be replaced by removable hard disk drives, read/write CD ROMs, flash memory, floppy disk drives, and the like. A small form factor, for example 2.5″, is currently contemplated, however, other form factors, such as PC card, and the like are also contemplated. Mass storage unit <b>240</b> may also support other interfaces than IDE.</p>
  <p num="p-0076">Among other features, the computer system includes an ACM with security protection.</p>
  <p num="p-0077">The ACM also has a network controller, which can be coupled to a serial port <b>302</b>, which is coupled to the PCI bus in the ACM. The serial port is coupled to the peripheral console through a serial controller <b>301</b> in the serial console. The serial controller is connected to PCI bus <b>239</b>. The serial controller is also coupled to a serial hub controller <b>303</b>, which is coupled to the PCI bus and a second ACM. In a specific embodiment, a receptacle board <b>310</b> is added to connect to the second ACM. The purpose of the receptacle board is to allow a cable connection <b>307</b> to the peripheral board <b>300</b>. The cable connection is possible because the signals needed to connect to the peripheral board can be limited to video, I/O, serial communication, and power. The serial communication controller can be placed on the receptacle board and not in the ACM. As shown, the serial bus controller couples to the PCI bus. The receptacle board also couples to power, graphics subsystem, I/O controller, and other elements, which may be on a common bus. The overall operation of the present configuration is similar to the previous one except it operates in serial communication mode.</p>
  <p num="p-0078">The Dual ACM system can support different usage models:</p>
  <p num="p-0079">1. One user using both ACMs concurrently with 1 or 2 monitors, and a common keyboard/mouse.</p>
  <p num="p-0080">2. Two users using the two separate ACMs at the same time with separate monitors and keyboard/mouse. The 2 users share peripherals, e.g., printer, CDROM, and others. The two users share external networking.</p>
  <p num="p-0081">To support 1 monitor for both ACMs, a video switch in the peripheral console is used to switch between the video outputs of the two ACMs. The system can be set to support either 1 monitor or 2-monitor mode. The user presses a special key on the keyboard or a special icon on the screen to switch the screen display from one ACM to the other. This same action causes the keyboard and mouse connections to switch from one ACM to the other ACM.</p>
  <p num="p-0082">A dual ACM system can save space, wiring, and cost for a 2-person PC setup, with the added benefit that both PC systems can be accessed from one user site for increased system performance if the other user is not using the system. Files can be copied between the primary drive of both system and provides protection against a single ACM failure. Software needs to be developed to manage the concurrent use of two PC subsystems, the automatic sharing of selected files between the two systems, and fault tolerance.</p>
  <p num="p-0083">The design with more than two computer modules can be implemented with the use of multi-port, serial communication hub controller and multi-port I/O switches. In one embodiment, a peripheral console has four computer bays for four separate computer modules. The computer modules communicate through a four port Ethernet hub. The video, keyboard, and mouse switch will cycle through the connection from each computer module to the external monitor, keyboard, and mouse with a push button sequentially. This embodiment is useful for a server that performs different functions concurrently, e.g. email, application hosting, web hosting, firewall, etc.</p>
  <p num="p-0084">The above embodiments are described generally in terms of hardware and software. It will be recognized, however, that the functionality of the hardware can be further combined or even separated. The functionality of the software can also be further combined or even separated. Hardware can be replaced, at times, with software. Software can be replaced, at times, with hardware. Accordingly, the present embodiments should not be construed as limiting the scope of the claims here. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives.</p>
  <p num="p-0085"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a simplified diagram of a method according to an embodiment of the present invention. This diagram is merely an example which should not limit the scope of the claims herein. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many other variations, modifications, and alternatives. The present diagram illustrates an automatic file backup procedure from one computer module to the other. As shown, a user selects (step <b>401</b>) a certain file in one of the computer module for automatic backup. Next, the method determines if another module is available, step <b>403</b>. If so, the method in the originating module requests the other computer module to create (step <b>405</b>) backup file. Alternatively, the method alerts the user of the missing or malfunctioning module, step <b>429</b>. The method then has the user try later <b>431</b>, once the missing or malfunctioning module has been replaced or repaired. Next, the method determines if there is sufficient storage available in the other computer module for the backup files. If so, the method goes to the next step. (Alternatively, the method prompts (step <b>433</b>) a message to the user indicating that the storage is full.) In the next step, the method stores the backup file in memory of the other module. After the backup file has been successfully created (step <b>409</b>), the software in the originating ACM sets a timer to check (step <b>411</b>) for file modification via branches <b>423</b>, <b>427</b> through continue, step <b>425</b> process. If a file selected for backup has been modified (step <b>415</b>), then the file is automatically back up to the other ACM again, step <b>417</b>. Alternatively, the method returns to step <b>411</b> through branch <b>421</b>.</p>

  <p num="p-0087"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a block diagram of one embodiment of a computer system <b>600</b> using the interface of the present invention. Computer system <b>600</b> includes an attached computer module (ACM) <b>605</b> and a peripheral console <b>610</b>, which are described in greater detail in the application of William W. Y. Chu for “Personal Computer Peripheral Console With Attached Computer Module” filed concurrently with the present application on Sep. 8, 1998 and incorporated herein by reference. The ACM <b>605</b> and the peripheral console <b>610</b> are interfaced through an exchange interface system (XIS) bus <b>615</b>. The XIS bus <b>615</b> includes power bus <b>616</b>, video bus <b>617</b> and peripheral bus (XPBus) <b>618</b>, which is also herein referred to as an interface channel. The power bus <b>616</b> transmits power between ACM <b>605</b> and peripheral console <b>610</b>. In a preferred embodiment power bus <b>616</b> transmits power at voltage levels of 3.3 volts, 5 volts and 12 volts. Video bus <b>617</b> transmits video signals between the ACM <b>605</b> and the peripheral console <b>610</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the video bus <b>617</b> transmits analog Red Green Blue (RGB) video signals for color monitors, digital video signals (such as Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) Plug and Display's Transition Minimized Differential Signaling (TMDS) signals for flat panel displays), and television (TV) and/or super video (S-video) signals. The XPBus <b>618</b> is coupled to host interface controller (HIC) <b>619</b> and to peripheral interface controller (PIC) <b>620</b>, which is also sometimes referred to as a bay interface controller.</p>
  <p num="p-0088">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, HIC <b>619</b> is coupled to an integrated unit <b>621</b> that includes a CPU, a cache and a north bridge. In another embodiment, such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the CPU <b>705</b> and north bridge <b>710</b> are separate rather than integrated units. In yet another embodiment, such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the HIC and PIC are integrated with the north and south bridges, respectively, such that integrated HIC and north bridge unit <b>805</b> includes an HIC and a north bridge, while integrated PIC and south bridge unit <b>810</b> includes a PIC and a south bridge.</p>
  <p num="p-0089"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a more detailed block diagram of one embodiment of an HIC <b>905</b> and a PIC <b>955</b> of the present invention. HIC <b>905</b> includes a peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus controller <b>910</b>, an XPBus controller <b>915</b>, a phase lock loop (PLL) clock <b>920</b> and an input/output (<b>10</b>) control <b>925</b>. Similarly, PIC <b>955</b> includes a PCI bus controller <b>960</b>, an XPBus controller <b>965</b>, a PLL clock <b>970</b> and an IO control <b>975</b>. PCI bus controllers <b>910</b> and <b>960</b> are coupled to the primary and secondary PCI buses <b>930</b> and <b>980</b>, respectively, and manage PCI transactions on the primary and secondary PCI buses <b>930</b> and <b>980</b>, respectively. Similarly, XPBus Controllers <b>915</b> and <b>965</b> are coupled to XPBus <b>990</b>. XPBus controller <b>915</b> drives the PCK line <b>991</b> and PD[<b>0</b>::<b>3</b>] and PCN lines <b>992</b> while XPBus controller <b>965</b> drives the PCKR lines <b>993</b>, the PDR[<b>0</b>::<b>3</b>] and PCNR lines <b>994</b> and the RESET# line <b>995</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0090">PCI bus controller <b>910</b> receives PCI clock signals from the primary PCI bus <b>930</b> and is synchronized to the PCI clock. However, as indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the XPBus controller <b>915</b> is asynchronous with the PCI bus controller <b>910</b>. Instead, the XPBus controller receives a clock signal from the PLL clock <b>920</b> and is synchronized therewith. PLL clock <b>920</b> generates a clock signal independent of the PCI clock. The asynchronous operation of the PCI bus and the XPBus allows the PCI Bus to change in frequency, for example as in a power down situation, without directly affecting the XPBus clocking. In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the PLL clock <b>920</b> generates a clock signal having a frequency of 66 MHz, which is twice as large as the 33 MHz frequency of the PCI clock. (The clock signal generated by the PLL clock may have a clock speed different from, including lower than, 66 MHz. For example, in another embodiment, which is discussed in greater detail below, the PLL clock <b>920</b> generates a clock signal having a frequency of 132 MHz.)</p>
  <p num="p-0091">The XPBus <b>990</b> operates at the clock speed generated by the PLL clock <b>920</b>. Therefore, PCK, the clock signal from the XPBus controller <b>915</b> to XPBus controller <b>965</b> has the same frequency as the clock signal generated by PLL clock <b>920</b>. XPBus controller <b>965</b> receives the PCK signal after it has been buffered and operates at the clock speed of PCK. The buffered version of the clock signal PCK is used to generate the clock signal PCKR, the clock signal form the XPBus controller <b>965</b> to XPBus controller <b>915</b>. Accordingly, PCKR also has the same frequency as that generated by the PLL clock <b>920</b>. The synchronous operation of PCK and PCKR provides for improved reliability in the system. In another embodiment, PCKR may be generated independently of PCK and may have a frequency different from that of PCK. It is to be noted that even when PCKR is generated from PCK, the slew between PCK and PCKR cannot be guaranteed because of the unknown cable length used for the XPBus. For a cable that is several feet long, the cable propagation delay alone can be several nano seconds.</p>
  <p num="p-0092">As indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, PLL clock <b>970</b> is asynchronous with the XPBus controller <b>965</b>. Instead, PLL clock <b>970</b> independently generates a clock signal that is used as a PCI clock signal on the secondary PCI bus <b>980</b>. The secondary PCI bus <b>980</b> operates at the same clock speed as the primary PCI bus <b>930</b>, namely at a frequency of 33 MHz.</p>
  <p num="p-0093"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a detailed block diagram of one embodiment of the HIC of the present invention. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, HIC <b>1000</b> comprises bus controller <b>1010</b>, translator <b>1020</b>, transmitter <b>1030</b>, receiver <b>1040</b>, a PLL <b>1050</b>, an address/data multiplexer (A/D MUX) <b>1060</b>, a read/write controller (RD/WR Cntl) <b>1070</b>, a video serial to parallel converter <b>1080</b> and a CPU control &amp; general purpose input/output latch/driver (CPU CNTL &amp; GPIO latch/driver) <b>1090</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0094">HIC <b>1000</b> is coupled to an optional flash memory BIOS configuration unit <b>1001</b>. Flash memory unit <b>1001</b> stores basic input output system (BIOS) and PCI configuration information and supplies the BIOS and PCI configuration information to A/D MUX <b>1060</b> and RD/WR Control <b>1070</b>, which control the programming, read, and write of flash memory unit <b>1001</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0095">Bus controller <b>1010</b> is coupled to the host PCI bus, which is also referred to herein as the primary PCI bus, and manages PCI bus transactions on the host PCI bus. Bus controller <b>1010</b> includes a slave (target) unit <b>1011</b> and a master unit <b>1016</b>. Both slave unit <b>1011</b> and master unit <b>1016</b> each include two first in first out (FIFO) buffers, which are preferably asynchronous with respect to each other since the input and output of the two FIFOs in the master unit <b>1016</b> as well as the two FIFOs in the slave unit <b>1011</b> are clocked by different clocks, namely the PCI clock and the PCK. Additionally, slave unit <b>1011</b> includes encoder <b>1022</b> and decoder <b>1023</b>, while master unit <b>1016</b> includes encoder <b>1027</b> and decoder <b>1028</b>. The FIFOs <b>1012</b>, <b>1013</b>, <b>1017</b> and <b>1018</b> manage data transfers between the host PCI bus and the XPBus, which in the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> operate at 33 MHz and 106 MHz, respectively. PCI address/data (AD) from the host PCI bus is entered into FIFOs <b>1012</b> and <b>1017</b> before they are encoded by encoders <b>1022</b> and <b>1023</b>. Encoders <b>1022</b> and <b>1023</b> format the PCI address/data bits to a form more suitable for parallel to serial conversion prior to transmittal on the XPBus. Similarly, address and data information from the receivers is decoded by decoders <b>1023</b> and <b>1028</b> to a form more suitable for transmission on the host PCI bus. Thereafter the decoded data and address information is passed through FIFOs <b>1013</b> and <b>1018</b> prior to being transferred to the host PCI bus. FIFOs <b>1012</b>, <b>1013</b>, <b>1017</b> and <b>1018</b>, allow bus controller <b>1010</b> to handle posted and delayed PCI transactions and to provide deep buffering to store PCI transactions.</p>
  <p num="p-0096">Bus controller <b>1010</b> also comprises slave read/write control (RD/WR Cntl) <b>1014</b> and master read/write control (RD/WR Cntl) <b>1015</b>. RD/WR controls <b>1014</b> and <b>1015</b> are involved in the transfer of PCI control signals between bus controller <b>1010</b> and the host PCI bus.</p>
  <p num="p-0097">Bus controller <b>1010</b> is coupled to translator <b>1020</b>. Translator <b>1020</b> comprises encoders <b>1022</b> and <b>1027</b>, decoders <b>1023</b> and <b>1028</b>, control decoder &amp; separate data path unit <b>1024</b> and control encoder &amp; merge data path unit <b>1025</b>. As discussed above encoders <b>1022</b> and <b>1027</b> are part of slave data unit <b>1011</b> and master data unit <b>1016</b>, respectively, receive PCI address and data information from FIFOs <b>1012</b> and <b>1017</b>, respectively, and encode the PCI address and data information into a form more suitable for parallel to serial conversion prior to transmittal on the XPBus. Similarly, decoders <b>1023</b> and <b>1028</b> are part of slave data unit <b>1011</b> and master data unit <b>1016</b>, respectively, and format address and data information from receiver <b>1040</b> into a form more suitable for transmission on the host PCI bus. Control encoder &amp; merge data path unit <b>1025</b> receives PCI control signals from the slave RD/WR control <b>1014</b> and master RD/WR control <b>1015</b>. Additionally, control encoder &amp; merge data path unit <b>1025</b> receives control signals from CPU CNTL &amp; GPIO latch/driver <b>1090</b>, which is coupled to the CPU and north bridge (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). Control encoder &amp; merge data path unit <b>1025</b> encodes PCI control signals as well as CPU control signals and north bridge signals into control bits, merges these encoded control bits and transmits the merged control bits to transmitter <b>1030</b>, which then transmits the control bits on the data lines PD<b>0</b> to PD<b>3</b> and control line PCN of the XPBus. Examples of control signals include PCI control signals and CPU control signals. A specific example of a control signal is FRAME# used in PCI buses. A control bit, on the other hand is a data bit that represents a control signal. Control decoder &amp; separate data path unit <b>1024</b> receives control bits from receiver <b>1040</b> which receives control bits on data lines PDR<b>0</b> to PDR<b>3</b> and control line PCNR of the XPBus. Control decoder &amp; separate data path unit <b>1024</b> separates the control bits it receives from receiver <b>1040</b> into PCI control signals, CPU control signals and north bridge signals, and decodes the control bits into PCI control signals, CPU control signals, and north bridge signals all of which meet the relevant timing constraints.</p>
  <p num="p-0098">Transmitter <b>1030</b> receives multiplexed parallel address/data (A/D) bits and control bits from translator <b>1020</b> on the AD[<b>31</b>::<b>0</b>] out and the CNTL out lines, respectively. Transmitter <b>1030</b> also receives a clock signal from PLL <b>1050</b>. PLL <b>1050</b> takes a reference input clock and generates PCK that drives the XPBus. PCK is asynchronous with the PCI clock signal and operates at 106 MHz, twice the speed of the PCI clock of 33 MHz. The higher speed is intended to accommodate at least some possible increases in the operating speed of future PCI buses. As a result of the higher speed, the XPBus may be used to interface two PCI or PCI-like buses operating at 106 MHz rather than 33 MHz or having 104 rather than 32 multiplexed address/data lines.</p>
  <p num="p-0099">The multiplexed parallel A/D bits and some control bits input to transmitter <b>1030</b> are serialized by parallel to serial converters <b>1032</b> of transmitter <b>1030</b> into 10 bit packets. These bit packets are then output on data lines PD<b>0</b> to PD<b>3</b> of the XPBus. Other control bits are serialized by parallel to serial converter <b>1033</b> into 10 bit packets and send out on control line PCN of the XPBus.</p>
  <p num="p-0100">A 10× multiplier <b>1031</b> receives PCK, multiplies it by a factor of 10 and feeds a clock signal 10 times greater than PCK into the parallel to serial converters <b>1032</b> and <b>1033</b>. The parallel to serial converters <b>1032</b> and <b>1033</b> perform bit shifting at 10 times the PCK rate to serialize the parallel bits into 10 bit packets. As the parallel to serial converters <b>1032</b> and <b>1033</b> shift bits at 10 times the PCK rate, the bit rate for the serial bits output by the parallel to serial converters is 10 times higher than PCK rate, i.e., 1060 MHz. However, the rate at which data packets are transmitted on the XPBus is the same as the PCK rate, i.e., 106 MHz. As the PCI buses operate at a clock and bit rate of 33 MHz, the XPBus has a clock rate that is twice as large and a bit rate per bit line (channel) that is 100 times as large as that of the PCI buses which it interfaces.</p>
  <p num="p-0101">Receiver <b>1040</b> receives serial bit packets on data lines PDR<b>0</b> to PDR<b>3</b> and control line PCNR. Receiver <b>1040</b> also receives PCKR on the XPBus as well as the clock signal PCK from PLL <b>1050</b>. The synchronizer (SYNC) <b>1044</b> of receiver <b>1040</b> synchronizes the clock signal PCKR to the locally generated clock signal, PCK, in order to capture the bits received from the XPBus into PCK clock timing.</p>
  <p num="p-0102">Serial to parallel converters <b>1042</b> convert the serial bit packets received on lines PDR<b>0</b> to PDR<b>3</b> into parallel address/data and control bits that are sent to decoders <b>1023</b> and <b>1028</b> and control decoder and separate data path unit <b>1024</b>, respectively. Serial to parallel converter <b>1043</b> receives control bit packets from control line PCNR, converts them to parallel control bits and sends the parallel control bits to control decoder &amp; separate data path <b>1024</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0103">A 10× multiplier <b>1041</b> receives PCKR, multiplies it by a factor of 10 and feeds a clock signal 10 times greater than PCKR into the serial to parallel converters <b>1042</b> and <b>1043</b>. Because the bits on PDR<b>0</b> to PDR<b>3</b> and PCNR are transmitted at a bit rate of 10 times the PCKR rate, the serial to parallel converters <b>1042</b> and <b>1043</b> perform bit shifting at 10 times the PCKR rate to convert the 10 bit packets into parallel bits. It is to be noted that the rate at which bit packets are transmitted on the XPBus is the same as the PCKR rate, i.e., 106 MHz. The parallel data and control bits are thereafter sent to decoders <b>1023</b> and <b>1028</b> by way of the AD[<b>3</b>::<b>0</b>] in line and to control decoder &amp; separate data path unit <b>1024</b> by way of CNTL in lines, respectively.</p>
  <p num="p-0104">Reset control unit <b>1045</b> of HIC <b>1000</b> receives the signal RESET#, which is an independent system reset signal, on the reset line RESET#. Reset control unit <b>1045</b> then transmits the reset signal to the CPU CNTL &amp; GPIO latch/driver unit <b>1090</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0105">As may be noted from the above, the <b>32</b> line host and secondary PCI buses are interfaced by 10 XPBus lines (PD<b>0</b>, PD<b>1</b>, PD<b>2</b>, PD<b>3</b>, PCN, PDR<b>0</b>, PDR<b>1</b>, PDR<b>2</b>, PDR<b>3</b>, PCNR). Therefore, the interface channel, XPBus, of the present invention uses fewer lines than are contained in either of the buses which it interfaces, namely the PCI buses. XPBus is able to interface such PCI buses without backup delays because the XPBus operates at a clock rate and a per line (channel) bit rate that are higher than those of the PCI buses.</p>
  <p num="p-0106">In addition to receiving a reset signal, the CPU CNTL &amp; GPIO latch/driver <b>1090</b> is responsible for latching input signals from the CPU and north bridge and sending the signals to the translator. It also takes decoded signals from the control decoder &amp; separate data path unit <b>1024</b> and drives the appropriate signals for the CPU and north bridge.</p>
  <p num="p-0107">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, video serial to parallel converter <b>1080</b> is included in HIC <b>1000</b>. In another embodiment, video serial to parallel converter <b>1080</b> may be a separate unit from the HIC <b>1000</b>. Video serial to parallel converter <b>1080</b> receives serial video data on line VPD and a video clock signal VPCK from line VPCK of video bus <b>1081</b>. It then converts the serial video data into 16 bit parallel video port data and the appropriate video port control signals, which it transmits to the graphics controller (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) on the video port data [<b>0</b>::<b>15</b>] and video port control lines, respectively.</p>
  <p num="p-0108">HIC <b>1000</b> handles the PCI bus control signals and control bits from the XPBus representing PCI control signals in the following ways:

HIC <b>1000</b> buffers clocked control signals from the host PCI bus, encodes them into control bits and sends the encoded control bits to the XPBus;</li> <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0125">2. HIC <b>1000</b> manages the signal locally; and</li> <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0126">3. HIC <b>1000</b> receives control bits from XPBus, translates the control bits into PCI control signals and sends the PCI control signals to the host PCI bus.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p num="p-0109"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a detailed block diagram of one embodiment of the PIC of the present invention. PIC <b>1100</b> is nearly identical to HIC <b>1000</b> in its function, except that HIC <b>1000</b> interfaces the host PCI bus to the XPBus while PIC <b>1100</b> interfaces the secondary PCI bus to the XPBus. Similarly, the components in PIC <b>1100</b> serve the same function as their corresponding components in HIC <b>1000</b>. Reference numbers for components in PIC <b>1100</b> have been selected such that a component in PIC <b>1100</b> and its corresponding component in HIC <b>1000</b> have reference numbers that differ by <b>500</b> and have the same two least significant digits. Thus for example, the bus controller in PIC <b>1100</b> is referenced as bus controller <b>1110</b> while the bus controller in HIC <b>1000</b> is referenced as bus controller <b>1010</b>. As many of the elements in PIC <b>1100</b> serve the same functions as those served by their corresponding elements in HIC <b>1000</b> and as the functions of the corresponding elements in HIC <b>1000</b> have been described in detail above, the function of elements of PIC <b>1100</b> having corresponding elements in HIC <b>1000</b> will not be further described herein. Reference may be made to the above description of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> for an understanding of the functions of the elements of PIC <b>1100</b> having corresponding elements in HIC <b>1000</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0110">As suggested above, there are also differences between HIC <b>1000</b> and PIC <b>1100</b>. Some of the differences between HIC <b>1000</b> and PIC <b>1100</b> include the following. First, receiver <b>1140</b> in PIC <b>1100</b>, unlike receiver <b>1040</b> in HIC <b>1000</b>, does not contain a synchronization unit. As mentioned above, the synchronization unit in HIC <b>1000</b> synchronizes the PCKR clock to the PCK clock locally generated by PLL <b>1050</b>. PIC <b>1100</b> does not locally generate a PCK clock and therefore, it does not have a locally generated PCK clock with which to synchronize the PCK clock signal that it receives from HIC <b>1000</b>. Another difference between PIC <b>1100</b> and HIC <b>1000</b> is the fact that PIC <b>1100</b> contains a video parallel to serial converter <b>1189</b> whereas HIC <b>1000</b> contains a video serial to parallel converter <b>1080</b>. Video parallel to serial converter <b>1189</b> receives 16 bit parallel video capture data and video control signals on the Video Port Data [<b>0</b>::<b>15</b>] and Video Port Control lines, respectively, from the video capture circuit (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) and converts them to a serial video data stream that is transmitted on the VPD line to the HIC. The video capture circuit may be any type of video capture circuit that outputs a 16 bit parallel video capture data and video control signals. Another difference lies in the fact that PIC <b>1100</b>, unlike HIC <b>1000</b>, contains a clock doubler <b>1182</b> to double the video clock rate of the video clock signal that it receives. The doubled video clock rate is fed into video parallel to serial converter <b>1182</b> through buffer <b>1183</b> and is sent to serial to parallel converter <b>1080</b> through buffer <b>1184</b>. Additionally, reset control unit <b>1135</b> in PIC <b>1100</b> receives a reset signal from the CPU CNTL &amp; GPIO latch/driver unit <b>1190</b> and transmits the reset signal on the RESET# line to the HIC <b>1000</b> whereas reset control unit <b>1045</b> of HIC <b>1000</b> receives the reset signal and forwards it to its CPU CNTL &amp; GPIO latch/driver unit <b>1090</b> because, in the above embodiment, the reset signal RESET# is unidirectionally sent from the PIC <b>1100</b> to the HIC <b>1000</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0111">Like HIC <b>1000</b>, PIC <b>1100</b> handles the PCI bus control signals and control bits from the XPBus representing PCI control signals in the following ways:

  <p num="p-0114"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a table showing the information transmitted on the XPBus during two clock cycles of the XPBus in one embodiment of the present invention where 10 data bits are transmitted in each clock cycle of the XPBus. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, A<b>00</b> to A<b>31</b> represent 32 bits of PCI address A[<b>31</b>::<b>0</b>], D<b>00</b> to D<b>31</b> represent 32 bits of PCI data D[<b>31</b>::<b>0</b>], BS<b>0</b> to BS<b>3</b> represent 4 bits of bus status data indicating the status of the XPBus, CM<b>0</b># to CM<b>3</b># represent 4 bits of PCI command information, BE<b>0</b># to BE<b>3</b># represent 4 bits of PCI byte enable information, and CN<b>0</b> to CN<b>9</b> represent 10 bits of control information sent in each clock cycle. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, for each of lines PD<b>0</b> to PD<b>3</b>, the 10 bit data packets contain one BS bit, one CM/BE bit, and eight A/D bits. For the PCN line, the 10 bit data packet contains 10 CN bits. The first clock cycle shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> comprises an address cycle in which 4 BS bits, 4 CM bits, 32 A bits and 10 CN bits are sent. The second clock cycle comprises a data cycle in which 4 BS bits, 4 BE bits, 32 D bits and 10 CN bits are sent. The bits transmitted on lines PD<b>0</b> to PD<b>3</b> represent 32 PCI AD[<b>31</b>::<b>0</b>] signals, 4 PCI C/BE# [<b>3</b>::<b>0</b>] signals, and part of the function of PCI control signals, such as FRAME#, IRDY#, and TRDY#.</p>
  <p num="p-0115">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, BS<b>0</b> to BS<b>3</b> are sent at the beginning of each clock cycle. The bus status bits indicate the following bus cycle transactions: idle, address transfer, write data transfer, read data transfer, switch XPBus direction, last data transfer, wait, and other cycles.</p>
  <p num="p-0116">Bits representing signals transmitted between the CPU and South Bridge may also be sent on the lines interconnecting the HIC and PIC, such as lines PCN and PCNR. For example, CPU interface signals such as CPU interrupt (INTR), Address <b>20</b> Mask (A<b>20</b>M#), Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI), System Management Interrupt (SMI#), and Stop Clock (STPCLK#), may be translated into bit information and transmitted on the XPBus between the HIC and the PIC.</p>
  <p num="p-0117"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a table showing the information transmitted on the XPBus during four clock cycles of the XPBus in another embodiment of the present invention where 10 data bits are transmitted in each clock cycle of the XPBus. In this embodiment, the XPBus clock rate is twice as large as the PCI clock rate. This allows sending data and address bits every other XPBus cycle. As can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, there are no address or data bits transmitted during the second or fourth XPBus clock cycle. The fact that the XPBus clock rate is higher than the PCI clock rate allows for compatibility of the XPBus with possible future expansions in the performance of PCI bus to higher data transfer and clock rates.</p>
  <p num="p-0118">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, there are 18 control bits, CN<b>0</b> to CN<b>17</b>, transmitted in every two XPBus clock cycles. The first bit transmitted on the control line in each XPBus clock cycle indicates whether control bits CN<b>0</b> to CN<b>8</b> or control bits CN<b>9</b> to CN<b>17</b> will be transmitted in that cycle. A zero sent at the beginning of a cycle on the control line indicates that CN<b>0</b> to CN<b>8</b> will be transmitted during that cycle, whereas a one sent at the beginning of a cycle on the control line indicates that CN<b>9</b> to CN<b>17</b> will be transmitted during that cycle. These bits also indicate the presence or absence of data and address bits during that cycle. A zero indicates that address or data bits will be transmitted during that cycle whereas a one indicates that no address or data bits will be transmitted during that cycle.</p>
  <p num="p-0119">In one embodiment, BS<b>0</b> and BS<b>1</b> are used to encode the PCI signals FRAME# and IRDY#, respectively. Additionally, in one embodiment, BS<b>2</b> and BS<b>3</b> are used to indicate the clock speed of the computer bus interface and the type of computer bus interface, respectively. For example, BS<b>2</b> value of zero may indicate that a 33 MHz PCI bus of 32 bits is used whereas a BS<b>2</b> value of one may indicate that a 66 MHz PCI bus of 32 bits is used. Similarly, a BS<b>3</b> value of zero may indicated that a PCI bus is used whereas a BS<b>3</b> value of one may indicated that another computer interface bus, such as an Institute of Electronics &amp; Electrical Engineers (IEEE) 1394 bus, is used.</p>
  <p num="p-0120"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a schematic diagram of lines PCK, PD<b>0</b> to PD<b>3</b>, and PCN. These lines are unidirectional LVDS lines for transmitting clock signals and bits such as those shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> from the HIC to the PIC. The bits on the PD<b>0</b> to PD<b>3</b> and the PCN lines are sent synchronously within every clock cycle of the PCK. Another set of lines, namely PCKR, PDR<b>0</b> to PDR<b>3</b>, and PCNR, are used to transmit clock signals and bits from the PIC to HIC. The lines used for transmitting information from the PIC to the HIC have the same structure as those shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, except that they transmit data in a direction opposite to that in which the lines shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> transmit data. In other words they transmit information from the PIC to the HIC. The bits on the PDR<b>0</b> to PDR<b>3</b> and the PCNR lines are sent synchronously within every clock cycle of the PCKR. Some of the examples of control information that may be sent in the reverse direction, i.e., on PCNR line, include a request to switch data bus direction because of a pending operation (such as read data available), a control signal change in the target requiring communication in the reverse direction, target busy, and transmission error detected.</p>
  <p num="p-0121">The XPBus which includes lines PCK, PD<b>0</b> to PD<b>3</b>, PCN, PCKR, PDR<b>0</b> to PDR<b>3</b>, and PCNR, has two sets of unidirectional lines transmitting clock signals and bits in opposite directions. The first set of unidirectional lines includes PCK, PD<b>0</b> to PD<b>3</b>, and PCN. The second set of unidirectional lines includes PCKR, PDR<b>0</b> to PDR<b>3</b>, and PCNR. Each of these unidirectional set of lines is a point-to-point bus with a fixed transmitter and receiver, or in other words a fixed master and slave bus. For the first set of unidirectional lines, the HIC is a fixed transmitter/master whereas the PIC is a fixed receiver/slave. For the second set of unidirectional lines, the PIC is a fixed transmitter/master whereas the HIC is a fixed receiver/slave. The LVDS lines of XPBus, a cable friendly and remote system I/O bus, transmit fixed length data packets within a clock cycle.</p>
  <p num="p-0122">The XPBus lines, PD<b>0</b> to PD<b>3</b>, PCN, PDR<b>0</b> to PDR<b>3</b> and PCNR, and the video data and clock lines, VPD and VPCK, are not limited to being LVDS lines, as they may be other forms of bit based lines. For example, in another embodiment, the XPBus lines may be IEEE 1394 lines.</p>
  <p num="p-0123">It is to be noted that although each of the lines PCK, PD<b>0</b> to PD<b>3</b>, PCN, PCKR, PDR<b>0</b> to PDR<b>3</b>, PCNR, VPCK, and VPD is referred to as a line, in the singular rather than plural, each such line may contain more than one physical line. For example, in the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, each of lines PCK, PD<b>0</b> to PD<b>3</b> and PCN includes two physical lines between each driver and its corresponding receiver. The term line, when not directly preceded by the terms physical or conductive, is herein used interchangeably with a signal or bit channel which may consist of one or more physical lines for transmitting a signal. In the case of non-differential signal lines, generally only one physical line is used to transmit one signal. However, in the case of differential signal lines, a pair of physical lines is used to transmit one signal. For example, a bit line or bit channel in an LVDS or IEEE 1394 interface consists of a pair of physical lines which together transmit a signal.</p>
  <p num="p-0124">A bit based line (i.e., a bit line) is a line for transmitting serial bits. Bit based lines typically transmit bit packets and use a serial data packet protocol. Examples of bit lines include an LVDS line, an IEEE 1394 line, and a Universal Serial Bus (USB) line.</p>

The block diagram <b>1800</b> has a variety of features such as those noted above, as well as others. In the present diagram, different reference numerals are used to show the operation of the present system.</p>
  <p num="p-0136">The block diagram is an attached computer module <b>1800</b>. The module <b>1800</b> has a central processing unit, which communicates to a north bridge <b>1841</b>, by way of a CPU bus <b>1827</b>. The north bridge couples to main memory <b>1823</b> via memory bus <b>1829</b>. The main memory can be any suitable high speed memory device or devices such as dynamic random access memory “DRAM”) integrated circuits and others. The DRAM includes at least 32 Meg. or 617 Meg. and greater of memory, but can also be less depending upon the application. Alternatively, the main memory can be coupled directly with the CPU in some embodiments. The north bridge also couples to a graphics subsystem <b>1815</b> via bus <b>1842</b>. The graphics subsystem can include a graphics accelerator, graphics memory, and other devices. Graphics subsystem transmits a video signal to an interface connector, which couples to a display, for example.</p>
  <p num="p-0137">The attached computer module also includes a primary hard disk drive that serves as a main memory unit for programs and the like. The hard disk can be any suitable drive that has at least 2 GB and greater. As merely an example, the hard disk is a Marathon <b>2250</b> (2.25 GB, 2½ inch drive) product made by Seagate Corporation of Scotts Valley, but can be others. The hard disk communicates to the north bridge by way of a hard disk drive controller and bus lines <b>1802</b> and <b>1831</b>.

  <p num="p-0138">The attached computer module also has a flash memory device <b>1805</b> with a BIOS. The flash memory device <b>1805</b> also has codes for a user password that can be stored in the device. The flash memory device generally permits the storage of such password without a substantial use of power, even when disconnected.

  <p num="p-0139">In a preferred embodiment, the present invention uses a password protection scheme to electronically prevent unauthorized access to the computer module. The present password protection scheme uses a combination of software, which is a portion of the security program, and a user password, which can be stored in the flash memory device <b>1805</b>. By way of the flash memory device, the password does not become erased by way of power failure or the lock. The password is substantially fixed in code, which cannot be easily erased. Should the user desire to change the password, it can readily be changed by erasing the code, which is stored in flash memory and a new code (i.e., password) is written into the flash memory. An example of a flash memory device can include a Intel Flash 28F800F3 series flash, which is available in 8 Mbit and 16 Mbit designs. Other types of flash devices can also be used, however.

  <p num="p-0140">In a specific embodiment, the present invention also includes a real-time clock <b>1810</b> in the ACM, but is not limited. The real-time clock can be implemented using a reference oscillator 14.31818 MHz <b>1808</b> that couples to a real-time clock circuit. The real-time clock circuit can be in the host interface controller. An energy source <b>1806</b> such as a battery can be used to keep the real-time clock circuit running even when the ACM has been removed from the console. The real-time clock can be used by a security program to perform a variety of functions. As merely an example, these functions include: (1) fixed time period in which the ACM can be used, e.g., ACM cannot be used at night; (2) programmed ACM to be used after certain date, e.g., high security procedure during owner's vacation or non use period; (3) other uses similar to a programmable time lock.

Alternatively, the password or user code can be placed in the device by a one time programming techniques using, for example, fuses or the like. The present password or user code provides a permanent “finger print” on the device, which is generally hardware. The permanent finger print can be used for identification purposes for allowing the user of the hardware to access the hardware itself, as well as other systems. These other systems include local and wide area networks. Alternatively, the systems can also include one or more servers. The present password and user identification can be quite important for electronic commerce applications and the like. In one or more embodiments, the permanent password or user code can be combined with the password on flash memory for the security program, which is described below in more detail.</p>
  <p num="p-0142">In one aspect of the invention, the user password is programmable. The password can be programmable by way of the security program. The password can be stored in a flash memory device within the ACM. Accordingly, the user of the ACM and the console would need to have the user password in order to access the ACM. In the present aspect, the combination of a security program and user password can provide the user a wide variety of security functions as follows:
</p> <ul> <li id="ul0013-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0014-0001" num="0180">1) Auto-lock capability when ACM is inserted into CMB;</li> <li id="ul0014-0002" num="0181">2) Access privilege of program and data;</li> <li id="ul0014-0003" num="0182">3) Password matching for ACM removal; and</li> <li id="ul0014-0004" num="0183">4) Automatic HDD lock out if tempering is detected.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p num="p-0143">In still a further embodiment, the present invention also includes a method for reading a permanent password or user identification code to identify the computer module. In one embodiment, the permanent password or user code is stored in a flash memory device. Alternatively, the permanent password or user code is stored in the central processing unit. The password or user code can be placed in the device upon manufacture of such device. Alternatively, the password or user code can be placed in the device by a one time programming techniques using, for example, fuses or the like. The present password or user code provides a permanent “finger print” on the device, which is generally hardware. The permanent finger print can be used for identification purposes for allowing the user of the hardware to access the hardware itself, as well as other systems. These other systems include local and wide area networks. Alternatively, the systems can also include one or more servers. The present method allows a third party confirm the user by way of the permanent password or user code. The present password and user identification can be quite important for electronic commerce applications and the like, which verify the user code or password. In one or more embodiments, the permanent password or user code can be combined with the password on flash memory for the security program.</p>
