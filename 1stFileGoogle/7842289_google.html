Some of the recombinant nucleic acid molecules, expression cassettes and vectors comprise codon-optimized sequences encoding the polypeptides and/or signal peptides. Some of the recombinant nucleic acid molecules, expression cassettes, and expression vectors comprise sequences encoding non-Listerial and/or non-secA1 signal peptides for secretion of the polypeptides. The invention also provides bacteria comprising the nucleic acid molecules, expression cassettes, and expression vectors, as well as compositions such as vaccines comprising the bacteria. Methods of making and using the bacteria, recombinant nucleic acid molecules, and expression cassettes are also provided.</div>

    <heading>STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT</heading> <p num="p-0003">This invention was made, in part, with government support under SBIR Grant No. 1 R43 CA 101421-01, awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government may have certain rights in the invention.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0004">The field of this invention relates generally to novel polynucleotides and expression cassettes useful for expression of polypeptides, including heterologous polypeptides, in recombinant bacteria. In particular, this invention relates to recombinant bacteria comprising the novel expression cassettes and/or nucleic acid molecules which are useful in vaccine compositions.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0005">Microbes have begun to be developed for use as vaccines that deliver heterologous antigens. Heterologous antigen delivery is provided by microbes that have been modified to contain nucleic acid sequences encoding a protein or antigen originating from a different species. Heterologous antigen delivery is especially advantageous for treating or preventing diseases or conditions that result from especially virulent or lethal sources, such as cancer and pathogenic agents (for example, HIV or Hepatitis B), wherein injection of a native infectious agent or cancer cell is potentially deleterious to the recipient organism, and administration of attenuated or killed agent or cell has proven unsuccessful in eliciting an effective immune response, or where sufficient attenuation of the infectious agent or cancer cell cannot be assured with acceptable certainty. Recently, certain bacterial strains have been developed as recombinant vaccines. For instance, an oral vaccine of attenuated <i>Salmonella </i>modified to express <i>Plasmodium berghei </i>circumsporozite antigen has been shown to protect mice against malaria (Aggarwal et al. 1990. J. Exp. Med. 172:1083).</p>
    <p num="p-0006"> <i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>(<i>Listeria</i>) is a Gram-positive facultative intracellular bacterium that is being developed for use in antigen-specific vaccines due to its ability to prime a potent CD4+/CD8+ T-cell mediated response via both MHC class I and class II antigen presentation pathways. See, for instance, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,051,237, 6,565,852, and 5,830,702.</p>
    <p num="p-0007"> <i>Listeria </i>has been studied for a number of years as a model for stimulating both innate and adaptive T cell-dependent antibacterial immunity. The ability of <i>Listeria </i>to effectively stimulate cellular immunity is based on its intracellular lifecycle. Upon infecting the host, the bacterium is rapidly taken up by phagocytes including macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) into a phagolysosomal compartment. The majority of the bacteria are subsequently degraded. Peptides resulting from proteolytic degradation of pathogens within phagosomes of infected APCs are loaded directly onto MHC class II molecules, and the processed antigens are expressed on the surface of the antigen presenting cell via the class II endosomal pathway, and these MHC II-peptide complexes activate CD4+ “helper” T cells that stimulate the production of antibodies. Within the acidic compartment, certain bacterial genes are activated including the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin, LLO, which can degrade the phagolysosome, releasing the bacterium into the cytosolic compartment of the host cell, where the surviving <i>Listeria </i>propagate. Efficient presentation of heterologous antigens via the MHC class I pathway requires de novo endogenous protein expression by <i>Listeria</i>. Within the cytoplasm of antigen presenting cells (APC), proteins synthesized and secreted by <i>Listeria </i>are sampled and degraded by the proteosome. The resulting peptides are shuttled into the endoplasmic reticulum by TAP proteins and loaded onto MHC class I molecules. The MHC I-peptide complex is delivered to the cell surface, which in combination with sufficient co-stimulation (signal 2) activates and stimulates cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) having the cognate T cell receptor to expand and subsequently recognize the MHC I-peptide complex displayed on, for example tumor cells. In the appropriate microenvironment, the activated T cell targets and kills the cancerous cell.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">Given the mechanisms by which <i>Listeria </i>programs the presentation of heterologous antigens via the MHC class I pathway, the efficiency of both expression of heterologous genes and secretion of the newly synthesized protein from the bacterium into the cytoplasm of the infected (antigen presenting) cell is directly related to the potency of CD8+ T cell priming and/or activation. Since the level of Ag-specific T cell priming is directly related to vaccine efficacy, the efficiency of heterologous protein expression and secretion is linked directly to vaccine potency.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">Thus, novel methods are needed in the art to optimize the efficiency of heterologous protein expression and secretion to maximize the potency of <i>Listeria</i>-based vaccines and other bacteria-based vaccines. It would also be beneficial to optimize the efficiency of heterologous protein expression and secretion in bacterial host expression systems where expression and secretion of large quantities of heterologous protein is desired.</p>

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <heading>I. Introduction</heading> <p num="p-0095">The present invention provides a variety of polynucleotides including recombinant nucleic acid molecules, expression cassettes, and expression vectors useful for expression and/or secretion of polypeptides, including heterologous polypeptides (e.g. antigens and/or mammalian proteins), in bacteria, such as <i>Listeria</i>. In some embodiments, these polynucleotides can be used for enhanced expression and/or secretion of polypeptides in bacteria. Some of the expression cassettes comprise codon-optimized coding sequences for the polypeptide and/or for the signal peptide. In addition, some of the expression cassettes for use in bacteria contain signal peptide sequences derived from other bacterial sources and/or from a variety of different secretory pathways. Bacteria comprising the expression cassettes are also provided, as are compositions, such as vaccines, containing the bacteria. Methods of using the polynucleotides, bacteria, and compositions to induce an immune response and/or to prevent or treat a condition, such as a disease (e.g. cancer), in a host are also provided.</p>
    <p num="p-0096">The invention is based, in part, on the discovery that codon-optimization of the signal peptide sequence in an expression cassette enhances the expression and/or secretion of a heterologous polypeptide (such as an antigen) from recombinant bacteria (particularly in combination with codon-optimization of the heterologous polypeptide), even when the signal peptide sequence is native to the bacteria (see, e.g., Examples 19 and 27, below). Additionally, it has been discovered that signal peptide sequences from non-secA1 secretory pathways and/or signal peptide sequences from non-Listerial bacterial sources can also be used to effect efficient expression and/or secretion of heterologous polypeptides from <i>Listeria </i>(see, e.g., Examples 19, 27, and 30 below). The invention is also based, in part, on the additional discovery that codon-optimization of the coding sequences of heterologous polypeptides enhances expression and/or secretion of the heterologous polypeptides in <i>Listeria </i>(see e.g., Example 19, below). Enhanced expression and/or secretion of the heterologous protein obtained through optimization of the expression cassette has also been shown to lead to enhanced immunogenicity of the bacteria comprising the optimized expression cassettes (see, e.g., Example 20, below). In addition, expression cassettes encoding protein chimeras comprising a heterologous antigen embedded within an autolysin have been shown to useful in effecting efficient expression and secretion of a heterologous antigen in <i>Listeria </i>(see, e.g., Example 29, below). The autolysin protein chimeras have also been shown to be immunogenic (see, e.g., Example 31A, below). In addition, <i>Listeria </i>comprising codon-optimized expression cassettes and/or expression cassettes comprising non-Listerial signal peptides have also been shown to be immunogenic, reduce tumor volume, and increase survival in a mouse model (see, e.g., Examples 31B-E, below).</p>
    <p num="p-0097">Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention provides a recombinant nucleic acid molecule, comprising a first polynucleotide encoding a signal peptide, wherein the first polynucleotide is codon-optimized for expression in a bacterium, and a second polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide (e.g., an antigen), wherein the second polynucleotide is in the same translational reading frame as the first polynucleotide, and wherein the recombinant nucleic acid molecule encodes a fusion protein comprising the signal peptide and the polypeptide. In some embodiments, the second polynucleotide is codon-optimized as well (typically for expression in the same type of bacteria as the first polynucleotide). In some embodiments, the first polynucleotide or the first and second polynucleotides are codon-optimized for expression in <i>Listeria, Bacillus, Yersinia pestis, Salmonella, Shigella, Brucella</i>, mycobacteria or <i>E. coli</i>. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide(s) is codon-optimized for expression in <i>Listeria</i>, such as <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>. In some embodiments, the polypeptide encoded by the second polynucleotide is (or comprises) an antigen, which, in some instances, may be a non-bacterial antigen. For instance, the antigen is, in some embodiments a tumor-associated antigen or is derived from such a tumor-associated antigen. For instance, in some embodiments, the antigen is K-Ras, H-Ras, N-Ras, 12-K-Ras, mesothelin, PSCA, NY-ESO-1, WT-1, survivin, gp100, PAP, proteinase 3, SPAS-1, SP-17, PAGE-4, TARP, or CEA, or is derived from K-Ras, H-Ras, N-Ras, 12-K-Ras, mesothelin, PSCA, NY-ESO-1, WT-1, survivin, gp100, PAP, proteinase 3, SPAS-1, SP-17, PAGE-4, TARP, or CEA. For instance, in some embodiments, the antigen is mesothelin, or an antigenic fragment or antigenic variant of mesothelin. In some other embodiments, the antigen is NY-ESO-1, or an antigenic fragment or antigenic variant of NY-ESO-1. In some embodiments, the antigen is an infectious disease antigen or is derived from an infectious disease antigen. In some embodiments, the signal peptide is bacterial (Listerial or non-Listerial). In some embodiments, the signal peptide encoded by the codon-optimized first polynucleotide is native to the bacterium. In other embodiments, the signal peptide encoded by the codon-optimized first polynucleotide is foreign to the bacterium. In some embodiments, the signal peptide is a secA1 signal peptide, such as an LLO signal peptide from <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>, a Usp45 signal peptide from <i>Lactococcus lactis</i>, or a Protective Antigen signal peptide from <i>Bacillus anthracis</i>. In some embodiments, the signal peptide is a secA2 signal peptide. For instance, the signal peptide may be the p60 signal peptide from <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>. In addition, the recombinant nucleic acid molecule optionally comprises a third polynucleotide sequence encoding p60, or a fragment thereof, in the same translational reading frame as the first and second polynucleotides, wherein the second polynucleotide is positioned within the third polynucleotide or between the first and third polynucleotides. In still further embodiments, the signal peptide is a Tat signal peptide, such as a <i>B. subtilis </i>Tat signal peptide (e.g., PhoD).

In some embodiments, the polynucleotides encoding the non-Listerial polypeptides are codon-optimized for expression in a <i>Listeria </i>bacterium.</p>
    <p num="p-0131">Methods of preparing recombinant nucleic acid molecules, including those described above, are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For instance, recombinant nucleic acid molecules can be prepared by synthesizing long oligonucleotides on a DNA synthesizer which overlap with each other and then performing extension reaction and/or PCR to generate the desired quantity of double-stranded DNA. The double-stranded DNA can be cut with restriction enzymes and inserted into the desired expression or cloning vectors. Sequencing may be performed to verify that the correct sequence has been obtained. Also by way of non-limiting example, alternatively, one or more portions of the recombinant nucleic acid molecules may be obtained from plasmids containing the portions. PCR of the relevant portions of the plasmid and/or restriction enzyme excision of the relevant portions of the plasmid can be performed, followed by ligation and/or PCR to combine the relevant polynucleotides to generate the desired recombinant nucleic acid molecules. Such techniques are standard in the art. Standard cloning techniques may also be used to insert the recombinant nucleic acid sequence into a plasmid and replicate the recombinant nucleic acid within a host cell, such as bacteria. The recombinant nucleic acid can then be isolated from the host cell.</p>
    <p num="p-0132">The invention also provides a method of using any of the recombinant nucleic acid molecules described herein to produce a recombinant bacterium (e.g. a recombinant <i>Listeria </i>bacterium). In some embodiments, the method of using a recombinant nucleic acid molecule described herein to make a recombinant bacterium comprises introducing the recombinant nucleic acid molecule into a bacterium. In some embodiments, the recombinant nucleic acid molecule is integrated into the genome of the bacterium. In some other embodiments, the recombinant nucleic acid molecule is on a plasmid which is incorporated within the bacterium. In some embodiments, incorporation of the recombinant nucleic acid molecule into the bacterium occurs by conjugation. The introduction into the bacterium can be effected by any of the standard techniques known in the art. For instance, incorporation of the recombinant nucleic acid molecule into the bacterium can occur by conjugation, transduction (transfection), or transformation.</p>
    <heading>III. Signal Peptides</heading> <p num="p-0133">In some embodiments, the recombinant nucleic acid molecules, expression cassettes, and/or vectors of the invention encode fusion proteins or protein chimeras which comprise signal peptides and are suitable for expression in and secretion from host cells such as bacteria. Thus, in some embodiments, the recombinant nucleic acid molecules, expression cassettes and/or vectors of the invention comprise polynucleotides encoding signal peptides.</p>
    <p num="p-0134">The terms “signal peptide” and “signal sequence,” are used interchangeably herein. In some embodiments, the signal peptide helps facilitate transportation of a polypeptide fused to the signal peptide across the cell membrane of a cell (e.g., a bacterial cell) so that the polypeptide is secreted from the cell. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the signal peptide is a “secretory signal peptide” or “secretory sequence”. In some embodiments, the signal peptide is positioned at the N-terminal end of the polypeptide to be secreted.</p>
    <p num="p-0135">In some embodiments, the sequence encoding the signal peptide in the recombinant nucleic acid molecule or expression cassette is positioned within the recombinant nucleic acid molecule or expression cassette such that the encoded signal peptide will effect secretion, of the polypeptide to which it is fused from the desired host cell (e.g., a bacterium). In some embodiments, in a recombinant nucleic acid molecule or an expression cassette, the polynucleotide encoding the signal peptide is positioned in frame (either directly or separated by intervening polynucleotides) at the 5′ end of the polynucleotide that encodes the polypeptide to be secreted (e.g., a polypeptide comprising an antigen).</p>
    <p num="p-0136">In some embodiments, the signal peptides that are a part of the fusion proteins and/or protein chimeras encoded by the recombinant nucleic acid molecules, expression cassettes and/or expression vectors, are heterologous to at least one other polypeptide sequence in the fusion protein and/or protein chimera. In some embodiments, the signal peptide encoded by the recombinant nucleic acid molecule, expression cassette and/or expression vector is heterologous (i.e., foreign) to the bacterium into which the recombinant nucleic acid molecule, expression cassette and/or expression vector is to be incorporated or has been incorporated. In some embodiments, the signal peptide is native to the bacterium in which the recombinant nucleic acid molecule, expression cassette and/or expression vector is to be incorporated.</p>
    <p num="p-0137">In some embodiments, the polynucleotide encoding the signal peptide is codon-optimized for expression in a bacterium (e.g., <i>Listeria </i>such as <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>). In some embodiments, the polynucleotide that is codon-optimized for a particular bacterium is foreign to the bacterium. In other embodiments, the polynucleotide that is codon-optimized for a particular bacterium is native to that bacterium.</p>
    <p num="p-0138">A large variety of signal peptides are known in the art. In addition, a variety of algorithms and software programs, such as the “SignalP” algorithms, which can be used to predict signal peptide sequences are available in the art. For instance, see: Antelmann et al., Genome Res., 11:1484-502 (2001); Menne et al., Bioinformatics, 16:741-2 (2000); Nielsen et al., Protein Eng., 10:1-6 (1997); Zhang et al., Protein Sci., 13:2819-24 (2004); Bendtsen et al., J.

    <p num="p-0139">In some embodiments the signal peptide is prokaryotic. In some alternative embodiments, the signal peptide is eukaryotic. The use of eukaryotic signal peptides for expression of proteins in <i>Escherichia coli </i>for example, is described in Humphreys et al., <i>Protein Expression and Purification, </i>20:252-264 (2000).</p>
    <p num="p-0140">In some embodiments, the signal peptide is a bacterial signal peptide. In some embodiments, the signal peptide is a non-Listerial signal peptide. In some embodiments, the signal peptide is a Listerial signal peptide. In some embodiments the signal peptide is derived from a gram-positive bacterium. In some embodiments, the signal peptide is derived from an intracellular bacterium.</p>
    <p num="p-0141">In some embodiments, the signal peptide (e.g., a non-secA1 bacterial signal peptide) used in a recombinant nucleic acid molecule, expression cassette, or expression vector is derived from <i>Listeria</i>. In some embodiments, this signal peptide is derived from <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>. In some embodiments, the signal peptide is a signal peptide from <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>. In some embodiments, the signal peptide is not derived from <i>Listeria</i>, but is instead derived from a bacterium other than a bacterium belonging to the genus <i>Listeria</i>. In some embodiments, the bacterial signal peptide is derived from a <i>Bacillus </i>bacterium. In some embodiments, the bacterial signal peptide is derived from <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>. In some embodiments, the bacterial signal peptide is derived from a bacterium belonging to the genus <i>Staphylococcus</i>. In some embodiments, the bacterial signal peptide is derived from a <i>Lactococcus </i>bacterium. In some embodiments, the bacterial signal peptide is derived from a <i>Bacillus, Staphylococcus</i>, or <i>Lactococcus </i>bacterium. In some embodiments, the bacterial signal peptide is a signal peptide from a <i>Bacillus, Staphylococcus</i>, or <i>Lactococcus </i>bacterium. In some embodiments, the bacterial signal peptide is a signal peptide derived from <i>Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus</i>, or <i>Lactococcus lactis</i>. In some embodiments, the bacterial signal peptide is a signal peptide from <i>Bacillus anthracis</i>. In some embodiments, the bacterial signal peptide is a signal peptide from <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>. In some embodiments, the bacterial signal peptide is a signal peptide from <i>Lactococcus lactis</i>. In some embodiments, the bacterial signal peptide is a signal peptide from <i>Staphylococcus aureus. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0142">In some embodiments of the polynucleotides described herein, the signal peptide that is derived from an organism, such as a bacterium, is identical to a naturally occurring signal peptide sequence obtained from the organism. In other embodiments, the signal peptide sequence encoded by the recombinant nucleic acid molecule, expression cassette, and/or expression vector is derived from a naturally occurring signal peptide sequence, i.e., a fragment and/or variant of a naturally occurring signal peptide sequence, wherein the fragment or variant still functions as a signal peptide. A variant includes polypeptides that differ from the original sequence by one or more substitutions, deletions, additions, and/or insertions. For instance, in some embodiments the signal peptide that is encoded by the polynucleotides contains one or more conservative mutations. Possible conservative amino acid changes are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. See, e.g., Section IV of the Detailed Description, below, for additional information regarding conservative amino acid changes.</p>
    <p num="p-0143">A signal peptide derived from another signal peptide (i.e., a fragment and/or variant of the other signal peptide) is preferably substantially equivalent to the original signal peptide. For instance, the ability of a signal peptide derived from another signal peptide to function as a signal peptide should be substantially unaffected by the variations (deletions, mutations, etc.) made to the original signal peptide sequence. In some embodiments, the derived signal peptide is at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, or at least about 95% able to function as a signal peptide as the native signal peptide sequence. In some embodiments, the signal peptide has at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, or at least about 95% identity in amino acid sequence to the original signal peptide. In some embodiments, the only alterations made in the sequence of the signal peptide are conservative amino acid substitutions. Fragments of signal peptides are preferably at least about 80% or at least about 90% of the length of the original signal peptides.</p>
    <p num="p-0144">In some embodiments, the signal peptide encoded by a polynucleotide in the recombinant nucleic acid molecules, expression cassettes, or expression vectors is a secA1 signal peptide, a secA2 signal peptide, or a Twin-arginine translocation (Tat) signal peptide. In some embodiments, the signal peptide is a secA1 signal peptide signal peptide. In some embodiments, the signal peptide is a non-secA1 signal peptide. In some embodiments, the signal peptide is a secA2 signal peptide. In some embodiments, the signal peptide is a twin-arginine translocation (Tat) signal peptide. In some embodiments, these secA1, secA2, or Tat signal peptides are derived from <i>Listeria</i>. In some embodiments, these secA1, secA2, or Tat signal peptides are non-Listerial. For instance, in some embodiments, the secA1, secA2, and Tat signal peptides are derived from bacteria belonging to one of the following genera: <i>Bacillus, Staphylococcus</i>, or <i>Lactococcus. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0145">Bacteria utilize diverse pathways for protein secretion, including secA1, secA2, and Twin-Arg Translocation (Tat). Which pathway is utilized is largely determined by the type of signal sequence located at the N-terminal end of the pre-protein. The majority of secreted proteins utilize the Sec pathway, in which the protein translocates through the bacterial membrane-embedded proteinaceous Sec pore in an unfolded conformation. In contrast, the proteins utilizing the Tat pathway are secreted in a folded conformation. Nucleotide sequence encoding signal peptides corresponding to any of these protein secretion pathways can be fused genetically in-frame to a desired heterologous protein coding sequence. The signal peptides optimally contain a signal peptidase cleavage site at their carboxyl terminus for release of the authentic desired protein into the extra-cellular environment (Sharkov and Cai. 2002 <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>277:5796-5803; Nielsen et. al. 1997 <i>Protein Engineering </i>10:1-6).</p>
    <p num="p-0146">The signal peptides used in the polynucleotides of the invention can be derived not only from diverse secretion pathways, but also from diverse bacterial genera. Signal peptides generally have a common structural organization, having a charged N-terminus (N-domain), a hydrophobic core region (H-domain) and a more polar C-terminal region (C-domain), however, they do not show sequence conservation. In some embodiments, the C-domain of the signal peptide carries a type I signal peptidase (SPase I) cleavage site, having the consensus sequence A-X-A, at positions-1 and -3 relative to the cleavage site. Proteins secreted via the sec pathway have signal peptides that average 28 residues. The secA2 protein secretion pathway was first discovered in <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>; mutants in the secA2 paralogue are characterized by a rough colony phenotype on agar media, and an attenuated virulence phenotype in mice (Lenz and Portnoy, 2002 <i>Mol. Microbiol. </i>45:1043-1056; and, Lenz et. al 2003 <i>PNAS </i>100:12432-12437). Signal peptides related to proteins secreted by the Tat pathway have a tripartite organization similar to Sec signal peptides, but are characterized by having an RR-motif (R—R—X-#-#, where # is a hydrophobic residue), located at the N-domain/H-domain boundary. Bacterial Tat signal peptides average 14 amino acids longer than sec signal peptides. The <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>secretome may contain as many as 69 putative proteins that utilize the Tat secretion pathway, 14 of which contain a SPase I cleavage site (Jongbloed et. al. 2002 <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>277:44068-44078; Thalsma et. al., 2000 <i>Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. </i>64:515-547).</p>
    <p num="p-0147">Shown in Table 1 below are non-limiting examples of signal peptides that can be used in fusion compositions (including protein chimera compositions) with a selected other polypeptide such as a heterologous polypeptide, resulting in secretion from the bacterium of the encoded protein.</p>

    <p num="p-0149">Accordingly, in some embodiments, the sequence that encodes the signal peptide encodes a secA1 signal peptide. An example of a secA1 signal peptide is the Listeriolysin O (LLO) signal peptide from <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>. In some embodiments, the recombinant nucleic acid molecule or expression cassette comprising a polynucleotide encoding an LLO signal peptide further comprises a polynucleotide sequence encoding the LLO PEST sequence. Other examples of secA1 signal peptides suitable for use in the present invention include the signal peptides from the Usp45 gene in <i>Lactococcus lactis </i>(see Table 1, above, and Example 12 below) and Pag (Protective Antigen) gene from <i>Bacillus anthracis</i>. Thus, in some embodiments, the signal peptide is a protective antigen signal peptide from <i>Bacillus anthracis</i>. In some other embodiments, the signal peptide is a secA1 signal peptide other than the protective antigen signal peptide from <i>Bacillus anthracis</i>. Another example of a secA1 signal peptide is the SpsB signal peptide from <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>(Sharkov et al., <i>J. of Biological Chemistry, </i>277: 5796-5803 (2002)).</p>
    <p num="p-0150">In some alternative embodiments, the heterologous coding sequences are genetically fused with signal peptides that are recognized by the secA2 pathway protein secretion complex. An auxiliary SecA paralog (SecA2) has been identified in nine Gram-positive bacteria that cause severe or lethal infections of humans. SecA2 is required for secretion of a subset of the exported proteomes (secretomes) of <i>Listeria</i>, Mycobacteria, and Streptococci (Braunstein et al., Mol. Microbiol. 48:453-64 (2003); Bensing et al., Mol. Microbiol., 44:1081-94 (2002); Lenz et al., Mol. Microbiol., 45:1043-1056 (2002); and Braunstein et al., J. Bacteriology, 183:6979-6990 (2001)). The <i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>SecA2 was identified through its association with bacterial smooth-rough variation, and mutations in secA2 reduced virulence of <i>L. monocytogenes </i>and <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0151">For example, the <i>Listeria </i>protein p60 is a peptidoglycan autolysin that is secreted by the secA2 pathway. As an example, the secA2 signal peptide and signal peptidase cleavage site from p60 can be linked genetically with the amino terminus of a desired protein (e.g. antigen)-encoding gene. In one embodiment, the pre-protein comprised of the secA2 signal peptide and signal peptidase-antigen fusion is translated from an expression cassette within a bacterium, transported through the Gram-positive cell wall, in which the authentic heterologous protein is released into the extracellular milieu.</p>
    <p num="p-0152">Alternatively, a heterologous sequence can be incorporated “in-frame” within p60, such that the heterologous protein is secreted in the form of a chimeric p60-heterologous protein. Insertion of the heterologous protein coding sequence in-frame into p60 can occur, for example, at the junction between the signal peptidase cleavage site and the mature p60 protein. In this embodiment, the chimeric protein retains the appropriate secA2 secretion signals, and also its autolysin activity, meaning that the heterologous protein is secreted as a gratuitous passenger of p60. In-frame incorporation of the heterologous antigen into p60 can be engineered at any point within p60 that retains both the secretion and autolysin activities of the p60 protein. An example of a partial expression cassette suitable for insertion of the desired antigen or other heterologous polypeptide coding sequence is described in Example 13, below.</p>
    <p num="p-0153">In some embodiments, the fusion protein encoded by the recombinant nucleic acid molecule is a chimera comprising a bacterial protein having a particular desirable property (in addition to the desired heterologous protein such as an antigen). In some embodiments the chimera comprises a hydrolase. In some embodiments, the recombinant nucleic acid molecule encodes a p60 chimera comprising the endopeptidase p60, a peptidoglycan hydrolase that degrades the bacterial cell wall. In some embodiments, the fusion protein encoded by the recombinant nucleic acid molecule comprises a <i>L. monocytogenes </i>hydrolase, for example, p60 (see, e.g., Genbank accession no. NP<sub>—</sub>464110) or N-acetylmuramidase (NamA) (Genbank accession no. NP<sub>—</sub>466213), both of which are secA2 dependent secreted proteins that degrade the cell wall. Such particular protein chimera compositions take advantage of not only molecular chaperones required for secretion of bacterial proteins, but also of the activity of the bacterial protein that can facilitate its secretion. Particular protein chimeras comprised of precise placement of a heterologous protein encoding sequence with a <i>L. monocytogenes </i>hydrolase result in the efficient expression and secretion of the heterologous protein. (See, e.g., the specific example, Example 29, below.) Accordingly, in some embodiments, the signal peptide encoded by the recombinant nucleic acid molecule as part of a fusion protein is p60 signal peptide. In some embodiments, the signal peptide encoded by the recombinant nucleic acid molecule as part of a fusion protein is a NamA signal peptide.</p>
    <p num="p-0154">In some embodiments, the recombinant nucleic acid molecule comprises a third polynucleotide sequence encoding p60 protein, or a fragment thereof, in the same translational reading frame as both the first polynucleotide encoding the p60 signal peptide and the second polynucleotide encoding the other polypeptide (e.g., antigen). The recombinant nucleic acid molecule then encodes a fusion protein comprising the signal peptide, the polypeptide encoded by the second polynucleotide (e.g., an antigen), and the p60 protein, or a fragment thereof. In such embodiments, the second polynucleotide is preferably positioned either within the third polynucleotide or between the first and third polynucleotides.</p>
    <p num="p-0155">In some embodiments, the secA2 signal peptide is a secA2 signal peptide derived from <i>Listeria</i>. For instance, in some embodiments, the signal peptide is a secA2 signal peptide such as the p60 signal peptide or the N-acetylmuramidase (NamA) signal peptide from <i>L. monocytogenes</i>. In addition, other <i>L. monocytogenes </i>proteins have been identified as not being secreted in the absence of secA2 (Lenz et al., Mol. Microbiology 45:1043-1056 (2002)) and polynucleotides encoding the signal peptides from these proteins can be used in some embodiments. Additionally, secA2 signal peptides from bacteria other than <i>Listeria </i>can be utilized for expression and secretion of heterologous proteins from recombinant <i>Listeria </i>or other bacteria. For instance, as an illustrative but non-limiting example, secA2 signal peptides from <i>B. anthracis </i>can be used in the recombinant nucleic acid molecules and/or expression cassettes. In other embodiments, a secA2 signal peptide from <i>S. aureus </i>is used. See Table 1. Proteins secreted via the SecA2 pathway in other bacteria have also been identified (see, e.g., Braunstein et al., Mol. Microbiol., 48:453-64 (2003) and Bensing et al., Mol. Microbiol. 44:1081-94 (2002)).</p>
    <p num="p-0156">Additional proteins secreted via the secA2 pathway can be identified. SecA2 homologues have been identified in a number of bacterial species (see, e.g., Lenz et al., Mol. Microbiology 45:1043-1056 (2002) and Braunstein et al., J. Bacteriology, 183:6979-6990 (2001)). Additional secA2 homologues can be identified by further sequence comparison using techniques known to those skilled in the art. Once a homologue is identified, the homologue can be deleted from the bacterial organism to generate a ΔsecA2 mutant. The supernatant proteins of the wild-type and mutant bacterial cultures can be TCA-precipitated and analyzed by any of the proteomics techniques known in the art to determine which proteins are secreted by the wild-type bacteria, but not the ΔsecA2 mutant. For instance, the secreted proteins can be analyzed via SDS-PAGE and silver staining. The resulting bands can be compared to identify those proteins for which secretion did not occur in the absence of the SecA2. (See, e.g., Lenz et al., Mol. Microbiology 45:1043-1056 (2002)). The N-terminal sequences of these proteins can then be analyzed (e.g., with an algorithm to predict the signal peptide cleavage site) to determine the secA2 signal peptide sequence used by that protein. N-terminal sequencing by automated Edman degradation can also be performed to identify the sequence of the signal peptide.</p>
    <p num="p-0157">In alternative embodiments, the polynucleotides encode polypeptides (e.g., heterologous polypeptide sequences) that are genetically fused with signal peptides that are recognized by the Tat pathway protein secretion complex. The Tat secretion pathway is utilized by bacteria, including <i>Listeria </i>spp., for secretion of proteins that are folded within the bacterium. For example, the <i>Listeria innocua </i>protein YwbN has a putative Tat motif at its amino terminus and thus uses the Tat pathway for secretion (Genbank Accession No. NP<sub>—</sub>469731 [gi|16799463|ref|NP<sub>—</sub>469731.1| conserved hypothetical protein similar to <i>B. subtilis </i>YwbN protein (<i>Listeria innocua</i>)], incorporated by reference herein). Another protein containing a Tat signal peptide is the YwbN protein from <i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>strain EGD(e) (Genbank Accession No. NP<sub>—</sub>463897 [gi|16802412|ref|NP<sub>—</sub>463897.1| conserved hypothetical protein similar to <i>B. subtilis </i>YwbN protein (<i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>EGD (e)]). As an example, the YwbN signal peptide and signal peptidase cleavage site from YwbN can be linked genetically with the amino terminus of a desired protein (e.g. antigen)-encoding gene. In this composition, the pre-protein comprised of the Tat signal peptide and signal peptidase-antigen fusion will be translated from an expression cassette within the bacterium, transported through the Gram-positive cell wall, in which the authentic heterologous protein is released into the extracellular milieu. Another protein predicted to be secreted from <i>Listeria innocua </i>via the Tat pathway is 3-oxoxacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase (Genbank Accession No. NP<sub>—</sub>471636 [gi|16801368|ref|NP<sub>—</sub>471636.1| similar to 3 (oxoacyl(acyl(carrier protein synthase (<i>Listeria innocua</i>)]). Polynucleotides encoding signal sequences from any of these proteins predicted to be secreted from <i>Listeria </i>via the Tat secretory pathway may be used in the polynucleotides, expression cassettes, and/or expression vectors described herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0158">Tat signal sequences from other bacteria can also be used as signal peptides, including, but not restricted to, phoD from <i>B. subtilis</i>. Examples of Tat signal peptides from <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, such as phoD, are described in Jongbloed et al., <i>J. of Biological Chemistry, </i>277:44068-44078 (2002); Jongbloed et al., <i>J. of Biological Chemistry, </i>275:41350-41357 (2000), Pop et al., <i>J. of Biological Chemistry, </i>277:3268-3273 (2002); van Dijl et al., <i>J. of Biotechnology, </i>98:243-254 (2002); and Tjalsma et al., Microbiology and <i>Molecular Biology Reviews, </i>64: 515-547 (2000), all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. Other proteins identified in <i>B. subtilis </i>that have been predicted to be secreted by the Tat pathway include those sequences having the following Genbank/Embl Accession Nos.: CAB15017 [gi|2635523|emb|CAB15017.1| similar to two (component sensor histidine kinase (YtsA) (<i>Bacillus subtilis</i>)]; CAB12056 [gi|2632548|emb|CAB12056.1| phosphodiesterase/alkaline phosphatase D (<i>Bacillus subtilis</i>)]; CAB12081 [gi|2632573|emb|CAB12081.1| similar to hypothetical proteins (<i>Bacillus subtilis</i>)]; CAB13278 [gi|2633776|emb|CAB13278.1| similar to hypothetical proteins (<i>Bacillus subtilis</i>)]; CAB14172 [gi|2634674|emb|CAB14172.1| menaquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase (iron (sulfur subunit) (<i>Bacillus subtilis</i>)]; CAB15089 [gi|2635595|emb|CAB15089.1| yubF (<i>Bacillus subtilis</i>)]; and CAB15852 [gi|2636361|emb|CAB15852.1| alternate gene name: ipa (29d˜similar to hypothetical proteins (<i>Bacillus subtilis</i>)], the sequences of which are all incorporated by reference herein. Thus, in some embodiments, the signal peptide encoded by the polynucleotide in the recombinant nucleic acid molecule and/or the expression cassettes is a Tat signal peptide derived from <i>B. subtilis</i>. Information on Tat signal peptides from <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </i>is provided in Ochsner et al., <i>PNAS, </i>99: 8312-8317 (2002). Also, Tat signal peptides from a wide variety of other bacteria are described in Dilks et al., <i>J. of Bacteriology, </i>185: 1478-1483 (2003) and Berks et al., <i>Molecular Microbiology, </i>35:260-274 (2000), both of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.</p>
    <p num="p-0159">Additional Tat signal peptide may be identified and distinguished from Sec-type signal peptides by their “twin-arginine” consensus motif. As noted above, signal peptides related to proteins secreted by the Tat pathway have a tripartite organization similar to Sec signal peptides, but are characterized by having an RR-motif (R—R—X-#-#, where # is a hydrophobic residue) located at the N-domain/H-domain boundary. Tat signal peptides are also generally longer and less hydrophobic than the Sec-type signal peptides. See, e.g., Berks et al., Adv. <i>Microb. Physiol., </i>47:187-254 (2003) and Berks et al., <i>Mol. Microbiol. </i>35:260-74 (2000).</p>
    <p num="p-0160">In addition, techniques analogous to those described above for the identifying new proteins secreted by the SecA2 pathway and their corresponding SecA2 signal peptides can also be used to identify new proteins secreted via the Tat pathway and their signal peptides. The reference Jongbloed et al., <i>J. Biological Chem., </i>277:44068-44078 (2002) provides examples of techniques which can be used to identify a protein expressed by a type of bacteria as a protein secreted via the twin-arginine translocation pathway.</p>
    <heading>IV. Polypeptides</heading> <p num="p-0161">The recombinant nucleic acid molecules described herein, as well as the expression cassettes or expression vectors described herein, can be used to encode any desired polypeptide. In particular, the recombinant nucleic acid molecules, expression cassettes, and expression vectors are useful for expressing heterologous polypeptides in a bacterium.</p>
    <p num="p-0162">In some embodiments (depending on the recombinant nucleic acid molecule, expression cassette or expression vector used), the polypeptide encoded by a polynucleotide of the recombinant nucleic acid molecule, expression cassette, and/or expression vector is encoded as part of a fusion protein with a signal peptide. In other embodiments, the encoded polypeptide is encoded as a discrete polypeptide by the recombinant nucleic acid molecule, expression cassette, or expression vector. In still other embodiments, the polypeptide encoded by a polynucleotide of the recombinant nucleic acid molecule, expression cassette, or expression vector is encoded as part of a fusion protein that does not include a signal peptide. In still other embodiments, the polypeptide encoded by a polynucleotide of the recombinant nucleic acid molecule, expression cassette, or expression vector of the invention is encoded as part of a fusion protein (also referred to herein as a protein chimera) in which the polypeptide is embedded within another polypeptide sequence.</p>
    <p num="p-0163">Thus, it is understood that each of the polypeptides listed herein (below and elsewhere) which are encoded by polynucleotides of the recombinant nucleic acid molecules, expression cassettes, or expression vectors of the invention may be expressed as either fusion proteins (fused to signal peptides and/or to or in other polypeptides) or as discrete polypeptides by the recombinant nucleic acid molecule, expression cassette, or expression vector, depending on the particular recombinant nucleic acid molecule, expression cassette or expression vector used. For instance, in some embodiments, a recombinant nucleic acid molecule comprising a polynucleotide encoding the antigen CEA will encode CEA as a fusion protein with a signal peptide.</p>
    <p num="p-0164">In some embodiments, the polypeptide is part of a fusion protein encoded by the recombinant nucleic acid molecule, expression cassette, or expression vector and is heterologous to the signal peptide of the fusion protein. In some embodiments, the polypeptide is positioned within another polypeptide sequence (e.g., a secreted protein or an autolysin, or fragments or variants thereof) to which it is heterologous.</p>
    <p num="p-0165">In some embodiments, the polypeptide is bacterial (either Listerial or non-Listerial). In some embodiments, the polypeptide is not bacterial. In some embodiments, the polypeptide encoded by the polynucleotide is a mammalian polypeptide. For instance, the polypeptide may correspond to a polypeptide sequence found in humans (i.e., a human polypeptide). In some embodiments, the polypeptide is Listerial. In some embodiments, the polypeptide is non-Listerial. In some embodiments, the polypeptide is not native (i.e., is foreign) to the bacterium in which the recombinant nucleic acid molecule, expression cassette, and/or expression vector is to be incorporated or is incorporated.</p>
    <p num="p-0166">In some embodiments, the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide is codon-optimized for expression in a bacterium. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide is fully codon-optimized for expression in a bacterium. In some embodiments, the polypeptide which is encoded by the codon-optimized polynucleotide is foreign to the bacterium (i.e., is heterologous to the bacterium).</p>
    <p num="p-0167">The term “polypeptide” is used interchangeably herein with “peptide” and “protein” and no limitation with respect to the length or size of the amino acid sequence contained therein is intended. Typically, however, the polypeptide will comprise at least about 6 amino acids. In some embodiments, the polypeptide will comprise, at least about 9, at least about 12, at least about 20, at least about 30, or at least about 50 amino acids. In some embodiments, the polypeptide comprises at least about 100 amino acids. In some embodiments, the polypeptide is one particular domain of a protein (e.g., an extracellular domain, an intracellular domain, a catalytic domain, or a binding domain). In some embodiments, the polypeptide comprises an entire (i.e., full-length) protein.</p>
    <p num="p-0168">In some embodiments, the polypeptide that is encoded by a polynucleotide of a recombinant nucleic acid molecule, expression cassette, and/or expression vector comprises an antigen or a protein that provides a palliative treatment for a disease. In some embodiments, the polypeptide that is encoded by a polynucleotide of a recombinant nucleic acid molecule, expression cassette, and/or expression vector is an antigen or a protein that provides a palliative treatment for a disease. In some embodiments, the polypeptide that is encoded is a therapeutic protein (or comprises a therapeutic protein).</p>
    <p num="p-0169">In some embodiments, the polypeptide that is encoded by a polynucleotide of a recombinant nucleic acid molecule, expression cassette, and/or vector comprises an antigen (e.g., any of the antigens described herein). In some embodiments, the polypeptide that is encoded by a polynucleotide of a recombinant nucleic acid molecule, expression cassette, and/or vector is an antigen. In some embodiments, the antigen is a bacterial antigen. In some embodiments, the antigen is a non-Listerial bacterial antigen. In some embodiments, however, the antigen is a non-Listerial antigen. In other embodiments, the antigen is a non-bacterial antigen. In some embodiments, the antigen is a mammalian antigen. In some embodiments, the antigen is a human antigen. In some embodiments, the polypeptide is (or comprises) an antigen comprising one or more immunogenic epitopes. In some embodiments, the antigen comprises one or more MHC class I epitopes. In other embodiments, the antigen comprises one or more MHC class II epitope. In some embodiments, the epitope is a CD4+ T-cell epitope. In other embodiments, the epitope is a CD8+ T-cell epitope.</p>
    <p num="p-0170">The polynucleotide encoding an antigen is not limited to any exact nucleic acid sequence (e.g., that encoding a naturally occurring, full-length antigen) but can be of any sequence that encodes a polypeptide that is sufficient to elicit the desired immune response when administered to an individual within the bacteria or compositions of the invention. The term “antigen,” as used herein, is also understood to include fragments of larger antigen proteins so long as the fragments are antigenic (i.e., immunogenic). In addition, in some embodiments, the antigen encoded by a polynucleotide of the recombinant nucleic acid, expression cassette, or expression vector may be a variant of a naturally occurring antigen sequence. (Similarly for polynucleotides encoding other, non-antigen proteins, the sequences of the polynucleotides encoding a given protein may vary so long as the desired protein that is expressed provides the desired effect (e.g. a palliative effect) when administered to an individual.)</p>
    <p num="p-0171">An antigen that is derived from another antigen includes an antigen that is an antigenic (i.e., immunogenic) fragment of the other antigen, an antigenic variant of the other antigen, or an antigenic variant of a fragment of the other antigen. A variant of an antigen includes antigens that differ from the original antigen in one or more substitutions, deletions, additions, and/or insertions.</p>
    <p num="p-0172">The antigenic fragment may be of any length, but is most typically at least about 6 amino acids, at least about 9 amino acids, at least about 12 amino acids, at least about 20 amino acids, at least about 30 amino acids, at least about 50 amino acids, or at least about 100 amino acids. An antigenic fragment of an antigen comprises at least one epitope from the antigen. In some embodiments, the epitope is a MHC class I epitope. In other embodiments, the epitope is a MHC class II epitope. In some embodiments, the epitope is a CD4+ T-cell epitope. In other embodiments, the epitope is a CD8+ T-cell epitope.</p>
    <p num="p-0173">A variety of algorithms and software packages useful for predicting antigenic regions (including epitopes) within proteins are available to those skilled in the art. For instance, algorthims that can be used to select epitopes that bind to MHC class I and class II molecules are publicly available. For instance, the publicly available “SYFPEITHI” algorithm can be used to predict MHC-binding peptides (Rammensee et al. (1999) Immunogenetics 50:213-9).

    <p num="p-0174">Once a candidate antigenic fragment believed to contain at least one epitope of the desired nature has been identified, the polynucleotide sequence encoding that sequence can be incorporated into an expression cassette and introduced into a <i>Listeria </i>vaccine vector or other bacterial vaccine vector. The immunogenicity of the antigenic fragment can then be confirmed by assessing the immune response generated by the <i>Listeria </i>or other bacteria expressing the fragments. Standard immunological assays such as ELISPOT assays, Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS) assay, cytotoxic T-cell activity assays, or the like, can be used to verify that the fragment of the antigen chosen maintains the desired imunogenicity. Examples of these types of assays are provided in the Examples below (see, e.g., Example 21). In addition, the anti-tumor efficacy of the <i>Listeria </i>and/or bacterial vaccines can also be assessed using the methods described below in the Examples (e.g., implantation of CT26 murine colon cells expressing the antigen fragment in mice, followed by vaccination of the mice with the candidate vaccine and observation of effect on tumor size, metastasis, survival, etc. relative to controls and/or the full-length antigen).</p>

    <p num="p-0178">In some embodiments, an antigen derived from another antigen is substantially equivalent to the other antigen. An antigen derived from another antigen is substantially equivalent to the original antigen from which it is derived if the antigen if the derived antigen has at least about 70% identity in amino acid sequence to the original antigen and maintains at least about 70% of the immunogenicity of the original antigen. In some embodiments, the substantially equivalent antigen has at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, or at least about 98% identity in amino acid sequence to the original antigen. In some embodiments, the substantially equivalent antigen comprises only conservative substitutions relative to the original antigen. In some embodiments, the substantially equivalent antigen maintains at least about 80%, at least about 90%, or at least about 95% of the immunogenicity of the original antigen. To determine the immunogenicity of a particular derived antigen and compare to that of the original antigen to determine whether the derived antigen is substantially equivalent to the original antigen, one can test both the derived and original antigen in any of a number of immunogenicity assays known to those skilled in the art. For instance, <i>Listeria </i>expressing either the original antigen or the derived antigen can be prepared as described herein. The ability of those <i>Listeria </i>expressing the different antigens to produce an immune response can be measured by vaccinating mice with the <i>Listeria </i>and then assessing the immunogenic response using the standard techniques of ELISPOT assays, Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS) assay, cytotoxic T-cell activity assays, or the like. Examples of these types of assays are provided in the examples below (see, e.g., Example 21).</p>

In some cases, an antigen, such as a tumor antigen, is capable of inducing a more significant immune response in a vaccine when the amino acid sequence differs slightly from that endogenous to a host. In other cases, the derived antigen induces a less significant immune response than the original antigen, but is, for instance, more convenient for heterologous expression in a Listerial vaccine vector due to a smaller size. In some embodiments, the amino acid sequence of a variant of a tumor-associated antigen, or a variant of a fragment of a tumor-associated antigen, differs from that of the tumor-associated antigen, or its corresponding fragment, by one or more amino acids. The antigen derived from a tumor-associated antigen will comprise at least one epitope sequence capable of inducing the desired immune response upon expression of the polynucleotide encoding the antigen within a host.</p>

    <p num="p-0187">In some embodiments of the invention, the antigen encoded by the recombinant nucleic acid molecule or expression cassette is CEA. In other embodiments, the antigen is an antigenic fragment and/or antigenic variant of CEA. CEA is a 180-kDA membrane intercellular adhesion glycoprotein that is over-expressed in a significant proportion of human tumors, including 90% of colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic, 70% of non-small cell lung cancer, and 50% of breast cancer (Hammarstrom, <i>Semin. Cancer Biol., </i>9:67-81). A variety of immunotherapeutics such as anti-idiotype monoclonal antibody mimicking CEA (Foon et al., <i>Clin. Cancer Res., </i>87:982-90 (1995), or vaccination using a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing CEA (Tsang et al., <i>J. Natl. Cancer Inst., </i>87:982-90 (1995)) have been investigated, unfortunately, however, with limited success. Nonetheless, investigators have identified a HLA*0201-restricted epitope, CAP-1(CEA605-613), that is recognized by human T cell lines that were generated from vaccinated patients. Vaccination of patients with DC pulsed with this epitope failed to induce clinical responses (Morse et al., <i>Clin. Cancer Res., </i>5:1331-8 (1999)). Recently, a CEA605-613 peptide agonist was identified with a heteroclitic aspartate to asparagine substitution at position 610 (CAP1-6D). Although this amino acid substitution did not alter MHC binding affinity of this peptide, the use of the altered peptide ligand (APL) resulted in improved generation of CEA-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in vitro. CAP1-6D-specific CTL maintained their ability to recognize and lyse tumor cells expressing native CEA (Zaremba et al., <i>Cancer Res., </i>57: 4570-7 (1997); Salazar et al., <i>Int. J. Cancer, </i>85:829-38 (2000)). Fong et al. demonstrated induction of CEA-specific immunity in patients with colon cancer vaccinated with Flt3-ligand expanded DC incubated with this APL. Encouragingly, 2 of 12 patients after vaccination experienced dramatic tumor regressions that correlated with the induction of peptide-MHC tetramer<sup>+</sup> T cells (Fong et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., </i>98:8809-14 (2001)).</p>

For example, the antigen may be part of a T cell receptor, the idiotype, specific to those T cells causing an autoimmune response, wherein the antigen incorporated into a vaccine of the invention would elicit an immune response specific to those T cells causing the autoimmune response. Eliminating those T cells would be the therapeutic mechanism to alleviating the autoimmune disease. Another possibility would be to incorporate into the recombinant nucleic acid molecule a polynucleotide encoding an antigen that will result in an immune response targeting the antibodies that are generated to self antigens in an autoimmune disease or targeting the specific B cell clones that secrete the antibodies. For example, a polynucleotide encoding an idiotype antigen may be incorporated into the recombinant nucleic acid molecule that will result in an anti-idiotype immune response to such B cells and/or the antibodies reacting with self antigens in an autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases treatable with vaccines comprising bacteria comprising the expression cassettes and recombinant nucleic acid molecules of the present invention include, but are not limited to, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, lupus, myasthenia gravis, vitiligo, scleroderma, psoriasis, pemphigus vulgaris, fibromyalgia, colitis and diabetes. A similar approach may be taken for treating allergic responses, where the antigens incorporated into the vaccine bacterium target either T cells, B cells or antibodies that are effective in modulating the allergic reaction. In some autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis, the disease results in hyperproliferative cell growth with expression of antigens that may be targeted as well. Such an antigen that will result in an immune response to the hyperproliferative cells is considered.</p>
    <p num="p-0202">In some embodiments, the antigen is an antigen that targets unique disease associated protein structures. One example of this is the targeting of antibodies, B cells or T cells using idiotype antigens as discussed above. Another possibility is to target unique protein structures resulting from a particular disease. An example of this would be to incorporate an antigen that will generate an immune response to proteins that cause the amyloid plaques observed in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE). While this approach may only provide for a reduction in plaque formation, it may be possible to provide a curative vaccine in the case of diseases like CJD. This disease is caused by an infectious form of a prion protein. In some embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention encode an antigen to the infectious form of the prion protein such that the immune response generated by the vaccine may eliminate, reduce, or control the infectious proteins that cause CJD.</p>
    <p num="p-0203">In some embodiments, the polypeptide encoded by a polynucleotide of the recombinant nucleic acid molecule, expression cassette, and/or expression vector comprises an infectious disease antigen or an antigen derived from an infectious disease antigen. In some embodiments, the polypeptide comprises an infectious disease antigen. In some other embodiments, the polypeptide comprises an antigen derived from an infectious disease antigen. In some embodiments, the polypeptide encoded by a polynucleotide of the recombinant nucleic acid molecule, expression cassette, and/or expression vector is an infectious disease antigen or is an antigen derived from an infectious disease antigen. In some embodiments, the polypeptide encoded by the recombinant nucleic acid molecule, expression cassette, and/or expression vector is an infectious disease antigen. In some embodiments, the polypeptide encoded by the recombinant nucleic acid molecule, expression cassette, and/or expression vector is derived from an infectious disease antigen.</p>
    <p num="p-0204">In other embodiments of the invention, the antigen is derived from a human or animal pathogen. The pathogen is optionally a virus, bacterium, fungus, or a protozoan. For instance, the antigen may be a viral or fungal or bacterial antigen. In one embodiment, the antigen encoded by the recombinant nucleic acid molecule, expression cassette, and/or expression vector that is derived from the pathogen is a protein produced by the pathogen, or is derived from a protein produced by the pathogen. For instance, in some embodiments, the polypeptide encoded by the recombinant nucleic acid molecules, expression cassette and/or expression vector is a fragment and/or variant of a protein produced by the pathogen.</p>
    <p num="p-0205">For instance, in some embodiments, the antigen is derived from Human Immunodeficiency virus (such as gp 120, gp 160, gp41, gag antigens such as p24gag and p55gag, as well as proteins derived from the pol, env, tat, vif, rev, nef, vpr, vpu and LTR regions of HIV), Feline Immunodeficiency virus, or human or animal herpes viruses. For example, in some embodiments, the antigen is gp 120. In one embodiment, the antigen is derived from herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2 (such as gD, gB, gH, Immediate Early protein such as ICP27), from cytomegalovirus (such as gB and gH), from metapneumovirus, from Epstein-Barr virus or from Varicella Zoster Virus (such as gpI, II or III). (See, e. g., Chee et al. (1990) <i>Cytomegaloviruses </i>(J. K. McDougall, ed., Springer Verlag, pp. 125-169; McGeoch et al. (1988) J. Gen. Virol. 69: 1531-1574; U.S. Pat. No. 5,171,568; Baer et al. (1984) <i>Nature </i>310: 207-211; and Davison et al. (1986) <i>J. Gen. Virol. </i>67: 1759-1816.)</p>
    <p num="p-0206">In another embodiment, the antigen is derived from a hepatitis virus such as hepatitis B virus (for example, Hepatitis B Surface antigen), hepatitis A virus, hepatitis C virus, delta hepatitis virus, hepatitis E virus, or hepatitis G virus. See, e. g., WO 89/04669; WO 90/11089; and WO 90/14436. The hepatitis antigen can be a surface, core, or other associated antigen. The HCV genome encodes several viral proteins, including E1 and E2. See, e. g., Houghton et al., <i>Hepatology </i>14: 381-388 (1991).</p>
    <p num="p-0207">An antigen that is a viral antigen is optionally derived from a virus from any one of the families Picornaviridae (e. g., polioviruses, rhinoviruses, etc.); Caliciviridae; Togaviridae (e. g., rubella virus, dengue virus, etc.); Flaviviridae; Coronaviridae; Reoviridae (e. g., rotavirus, etc.); Birnaviridae; Rhabodoviridae (e. g., rabies virus, etc.); Orthomyxoviridae (e. g., influenza virus types A, B and C, etc.); Filoviridae; Paramyxoviridae (e. g., mumps virus, measles virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, etc.); Bunyaviridae; Arenaviridae; Retroviradae (e. g., HTLV-I; HTLV-11; HIV-1 (also known as HTLV-111, LAV, ARV, hTLR, etc.)), including but not limited to antigens from the isolates HIVI11b, HIVSF2, HTVLAV, HIVLAI, HIVMN); HIV-1CM235, HIV-1; HIV-2, among others; simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)); Papillomavirus, the tick-borne encephalitis viruses; and the like. See, e. g. <i>Virology, </i>3rd Edition (W. K. Joklik ed. 1988); <i>Fundamental Virology, </i>3rd Edition (B. N. Fields, D. M. Knipe, and P. M. Howley, Eds. 1996), for a description of these and other viruses. In one embodiment, the antigen is Flu-HA (Morgan et al., J. Immunol. 160:643 (1998)).</p>
    <p num="p-0208">In some alternative embodiments, the antigen is derived from bacterial pathogens such as <i>Mycobacterium, Bacillus, Yersinia, Salmonella, Neisseria, Borrelia </i>(for example, OspA or OspB or derivatives thereof), Chlamydia, or Bordetella (for example, P.69, PT and FHA), or derived from parasites such as plasmodium or Toxoplasma. In one embodiment, the antigen is derived from <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </i>(e.g. ESAT-6, 85A, 85B, 85C, 72F), <i>Bacillus anthracis </i>(e.g. PA), or <i>Yersinia pestis </i>(e.g. F1, V). In addition, antigens suitable for use in the present invention can be obtained or derived from known causative agents responsible for diseases including, but not limited to, Diptheria, Pertussis, Tetanus, Tuberculosis, Bacterial or Fungal Pneumonia, Otitis Media, Gonorrhea, Cholera, Typhoid, Meningitis, Mononucleosis, Plague, Shigellosis or Salmonellosis, Legionaire's Disease, Lyme Disease, Leprosy, Malaria, Hookworm, Onchocerciasis, Schistosomiasis, Trypanosomiasis, Leishmaniasis, Giardia, Amoebiasis, Filariasis, Borelia, and Trichinosis. Still further antigens can be obtained or derived from unconventional pathogens such as the causative agents of kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), scrapie, transmissible mink encephalopathy, and chronic wasting diseases, or from proteinaceous infectious particles such as prions that are associated with mad cow disease.</p>
    <p num="p-0209">In still other embodiments, the antigen is obtained or derived from a biological agent involved in the onset or progression of neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's disease), metabolic diseases (such as Type I diabetes), and drug addictions (such as nicotine addiction). Alternatively, the antigen encoded by the recombinant nucleic acid molecule is used for pain management and the antigen is a pain receptor or other agent involved in the transmission of pain signals.</p>
    <p num="p-0210">In some embodiments, the antigen is a human protein or is derived from a human protein. In other embodiments, the antigen is a non-human protein or is derived from a non-human protein (a fragment and/or variant thereof). In some embodiments, the antigen portion of the fusion protein encoded by the expression cassette is a protein from a non-human animal or is a protein derived from a non-human animal. For instance, even if the antigen is to be expressed in a <i>Listeria</i>-based vaccine that is to be used in humans, in some embodiments, the antigen can be murine mesothelin or derived from murine mesothelin.</p>
    <heading>V. Codon-Optimization</heading> <p num="p-0211">In some embodiments, one or more of the polynucleotides (i.e., polynucleotide sequences) within the recombinant nucleic acid molecule, expression cassette and/or expression vector are codon-optimized (relative to the native coding sequence). In some embodiments, a polynucleotide in the recombinant nucleic acid molecules (and/or in the expression cassette and/or expression vector) described herein that encodes a signal peptide is codon-optimized for expression in a bacterium. In some embodiments, a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide other than a signal peptide, such as an antigen or other therapeutic protein, is codon-optimized for expression in a bacterium. In some embodiments, both a polynucleotide encoding a signal peptide and a polynucleotide encoding another polypeptide fused to the signal peptide are codon-optimized for expression in a bacterium. In some embodiments, a polynucleotide encoding a secreted protein (or fragment thereof) used as a scaffold or a polynucleotide encoding an autolysin (or fragment or variant thereof) is codon-optimized.</p>
    <p num="p-0212">A polynucleotide comprising a coding sequence is “codon-optimized” if at least one codon of the native coding sequence of the polynucleotide has been replaced with a codon that is more frequently used by the organism in which the coding sequence is to be expressed (the “target organism”) than the original codon of the native coding sequence. For instance, a polynucleotide encoding a non-bacterial antigen that is to be expressed in a particular species of bacteria is codon-optimized if at least one of the codons from the native bacterial polynucleotide sequence is replaced with a codon that is preferentially expressed in that particular species of bacteria in which the non-bacterial antigen is to be expressed. As another example, a polynucleotide encoding a human cancer antigen that is to be part of an expression cassette in recombinant <i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>is codon-optimized if at least one codon in the polynucleotide sequence is replaced with a codon that is more frequently used by <i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>for that amino acid than the codon in the original human sequence would be. Likewise, a polynucleotide encoding a signal peptide native to <i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>(such as the LLO signal peptide from <i>L. monocytogenes</i>) that is to be part of an expression cassette to encode a fusion protein comprising a human cancer antigen in recombinant <i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>is codon-optimized if at least one codon in the polynucleotide sequence encoding the signal peptide is replaced with a codon that is more frequently used by <i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>for that amino acid than the codon in the original (native) sequence is. In some embodiments, at least one codon that is replaced in the codon-optimized sequence is replaced with the codon most frequently used by the target organism to code for the same amino acid.</p>
    <p num="p-0213">In some embodiments, at least two codons of the native coding sequence of the polynucleotide have been replaced with a codon that is more frequently used by the organism in which the coding sequence is to be expressed than the original codon of the native coding sequence. In some embodiments, at least about five codons, at least about 10 codons, or at least about 20 codons of the native coding sequence of the polynucleotide have been replaced with a codon that is more frequently used by the organism in which the coding sequence is to be expressed than the original codon of the native coding sequence.</p>
    <p num="p-0214">In some embodiments, at least about 10% of the codons in the codon-optimized polynucleotide have been replaced with codons more frequently (or most frequently) used by the target organism (than the original codons of the native sequence). In other embodiments, at least about 25% of the codons in the codon-optimized polynucleotide have been replaced with codons more frequently used (or most frequently) used by the target organism. In other embodiments, at least about 50% of the codons in the codon-optimized polynucleotide have been replaced with codons more frequently used (or most frequently) used by the target organism. In still other embodiments, at least about 75% of the codons in the codon-optimized polynucleotide have been replaced with codons more frequently used (or most frequently used) by the target organism.</p>
    <p num="p-0215">The codon preferences of different organisms have been widely studied by those skilled in the art. For instance, see Sharp et al., <i>Nucleic Acids Res., </i>15:1281-95 (1987) and Uchijima et al., <i>The Journal of Immunology, </i>161:5594-9 (1998). As a result, codon usage tables are publicly available for a wide variety of organisms. For instance, codon usage tables can be found as described in Nakamura et al. (2000) <i>Nucleic Acids Research </i>28:292. An exemplary codon usage table for <i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>is reproduced for convenience below in Table 2A. Exemplary codon usage tables for <i>Bacillus anthracis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella typhimurium, Mycobacterium bovis BCG</i>, and <i>Shigella flexneri </i>are also provided in Tables 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E, and 2F, respectively, below.</p>

    <p num="p-0222">In some embodiments of the invention, at least about 10%, at least about, 25%, at least about 50%, or at least about 75% of the codons in a codon-optimized coding sequence are the most preferred codon for that amino acid used in the target organism. In other embodiments, 100% of the codons in the codon-optimized coding sequence are the most preferred codon for that amino acid in the target organism (i.e., the sequence is “fully codon-optimized”). For instance, in the Examples shown below, all of the codons of the sequences characterized as codon-optimized were the most frequently used codons for the target organism; however, any codon substitution that results in a more frequently used codon than the original (native) sequence can be considered “codon-optimized”. Table 3, below shows the optimal codon usage in <i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>for each amino acid.</p>

    <p num="p-0224">In some embodiments, the codon-optimized polynucleotides encode a signal peptide. In some embodiments, the signal peptide is foreign to the bacterium for which the sequence is codon-optimized. In other embodiments, the signal peptide is native to the bacterium for which the sequence is codon-optimized. For instance, in some embodiments, the codon-optimized polynucleotide encodes a signal peptide selected from the group consisting of LLO signal peptide from <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>, Usp45 signal peptide from <i>Lactococcus lactis</i>, Protective Antigen signal peptide from <i>Bacillus anthracis</i>, p60 signal peptide from <i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>and PhoD signal peptide from <i>B. subtilis </i>Tat signal peptide. In some embodiments, the codon-optimized polynucleotide encodes a signal peptide other than Protective Antigen signal peptide from <i>Bacillus anthracis</i>. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide encoding a signal peptide is codon-optimized for expression in <i>Listeria monocytogenes. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0225">In some embodiments, the codon-optimized polynucleotide encodes a (non-signal peptide) protein that is foreign to the bacterium for which the polynucleotide sequence has been codon-optimized. In some embodiments, the codon-optimized polynucleotide encodes a polypeptide comprising an antigen. For instance, in some embodiments, the codon-optimized polynucleotide encodes a polypeptide comprising an antigen that is a tumor-associated antigen or an antigen that is derived from a tumor-associated antigen.</p>
    <p num="p-0226">In some embodiments, codon-optimization of a polynucleotide encoding a signal peptide and/or other polypeptide enhances expression of a polypeptide (such as a fusion protein, protein chimera and/or a foreign polypeptide encoded by a recombinant nucleic acid molecule, expression cassette, or expression vector) comprising the signal peptide and/or other polypeptide in a bacterium, relative to the corresponding polynucleotide without codon-optimization. In some embodiments, the codon-optimization of the polynucleotide enhances expression by at least about 2-fold, by at least about 5-fold, by at least about 10-fold, or by at least about 20 fold (relative to the corresponding polynucleotide without codon-optimization). In some embodiments, codon-optimization of a polynucleotide encoding a signal peptide and/or other polypeptide enhances secretion of a polypeptide (such as a fusion protein, protein chimera and/or a foreign polypeptide) comprising the signal peptide and/or other polypeptide from a bacterium, relative to the corresponding polynucleotide without codon-optimization. In some embodiments, the codon-optimization enhances secretion by at least about 2-fold, by at least about 5-fold, by at least about 10-fold, or by at least about 20 fold (relative to the corresponding polynucleotide without codon-optimization). In some embodiments, both the level of expression and secretion is enhanced. Levels of expression and/or secretion can be readily assessed using techniques standard to those in the art such as Western blots of the various relevant bacterial culture fractions.</p>
    <heading>VI. Expression Cassettes</heading> <p num="p-0227">Expression cassettes are also provided by the present invention. For instance, in some embodiments, the invention provides an expression cassette comprising any of the recombinant nucleic acid molecules described herein and further comprising promoter sequences operably linked to the coding sequences in the recombinant nucleic acid molecules (e.g., the first polynucleotide encoding a signal peptide and the second polynucleotide encoding the other polypeptide). In some embodiments, the expression cassette is isolated. In some other embodiments, the expression cassette is contained within an expression vector, which may be isolated or may be contained within a bacterium. In still further embodiments, the expression cassette is positioned in the chromosomal DNA of a bacterium. For instance, in some embodiments, the expression cassette has been integrated within the genome of a bacterium. In some embodiments, an expression cassette that is integrated within the genome of a bacterium comprises one or more elements from the genomic DNA. For instance, in some embodiments, a recombinant nucleic acid molecule is inserted in a site in the genomic DNA of a bacterium (e.g., via site-specific integration or homologous recombination) such that the recombinant nucleic acid is operably linked to a promoter already present in the genomic DNA, thereby generating a new expression cassette integrated within the genomic DNA. In some other embodiments, the expression cassette is integrated into the genomic DNA (e.g., via site-specific integration or homologous recombination) as an intact unit comprising both the promoter and the recombinant nucleic acid molecule.</p>
    <p num="p-0228">In some embodiments, the expression cassettes are designed for expression of polypeptides in bacteria. In some embodiments, the expression cassettes are designed for the expression of heterologous polypeptides, such as heterologous antigens in bacteria. In some embodiments, the expression cassettes provide enhanced expression and/or secretion of the polypeptides.</p>
    <p num="p-0229">Generally, an expression cassette comprises the following ordered elements: (1) a promoter and (2) a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide. In some embodiments, an expression cassette comprises the following elements: (1) a promoter; (2) a polynucleotide encoding a signal peptide; and (3) a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide (e.g., a heterologous protein). In still other embodiments, an expression cassette comprises the following elements: (1) prokaryotic promoter; (2) Shine-Dalgarno sequence; (3) a polynucleotide encoding a signal peptide; and, (4) a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide (such as a heterologous protein). In some embodiments, an expression cassette comprises more than one promoter.</p>
    <p num="p-0230">In some embodiments, the expression cassette may also contain a transcription termination sequence inserted downstream from the C-terminus of the translational stop codon related to the heterologous polypeptide. For instance, in some embodiments, a transcription termination sequence may be used in constructs designed for stable integration within the bacterial chromosome. While not required, inclusion of a transcription termination sequence as the final ordered element in a heterologous gene expression cassette may prevent polar effects on the regulation of expression of adjacent genes due to read-through transcription. Accordingly, in some embodiments, appropriate sequence elements known to those who are skilled in the art that promote either rho-dependent or rho-independent transcription termination can be placed in the heterologous protein expression cassette.</p>

The polynucleotide encoding the signal peptide is also operably linked with the promoter so that the expression cassette expresses a fusion protein comprising both the foreign polypeptide and the signal peptide. Polynucleotides encoding signal peptides suitable for use in the expression cassette include, but are not limited to, those described above. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide encoding a signal peptide that is included in the expression cassette is codon-optimized for expression in a bacterium such as <i>Listeria </i>(e.g., a <i>L. monocytogenes </i>bacterium) as described above.</p>
    <p num="p-0236">The invention also provides an expression cassette comprising the following: (a) a first polynucleotide encoding a non-Listerial signal peptide; (b) a second polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide that is in the same translational reading frame as the first polynucleotide; and (c) a promoter operably linked to both the first and second polynucleotides, wherein the expression cassette encodes a fusion protein comprising both the non-Listerial signal peptide and the polypeptide.

In some embodiments, the protein chimera is catalytically active as an autolysin. In some embodiments, the polypeptide is heterologous to the autolysin. In some embodiments, the bacterial autolysin is from an intracellular bacterium (e.g., <i>Listeria</i>). In some embodiments, the second polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide is inserted within the first polynucleotide encoding the autolysin, or catalytically active fragment or catalytically active variant thereof, and the expression cassette encodes a protein chimera in which the polypeptide is inserted within the autolysin, or catalytically active fragment or catalytically active variant thereof (i.e., the polypeptide is embedded within the autolysin or catalytically active fragment or catalytically active variant thereof).

    <p num="p-0239">In some embodiments, the promoters in the expression cassettes described herein (or recombinant nucleic acid molecules described herein) are prokaryotic promoters. For instance, the prokaryotic promoters can be Listerial promoters. In some embodiments, the Listerial promoter is an hly promoter.

One of ordinary skill in the art will be readily able to identify additional prokaryotic and/or Listerial promoters suitable for use in the expression cassettes in view of the intended use of the expression cassette and host bacteria into which the expression cassette will be placed.</p>
    <p num="p-0240">For instance, a variety of mycobacterial promoters suitable for use in the recombinant expression cassettes within mycobacteria and other bacteria are known. These include the <i>Mycobacterium bovis </i>BCG promoters HSP60 and HSP70, and also include such promoters as the mycobactin promoters, α-antigen promoter and 45 KDa antigen promoter of <i>M. tuberculosis </i>and BCG, the superoxide dismutase promoter, MBP-70, the mycobacterial asd promoter, the mycobacterial 14 kDa and 12 kDa antigen promoters, mycobacteriophage promoters such as the Bxb1, Bxb2, and Bxb3 promoters, the L1 and L5 promoters, the D29 promoter and the TM4 promoters (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,566,121). Promoters suitable for use in <i>Bacillus anthracis </i>include, but are not limited to, the pagA promoter, the alpha-amylase promoter (Pamy), and Pntr (see, e.g., Gat et al., <i>Infect. Immun., </i>71; 801-13 (2003)). Promoters suitable for use in recombinant Salmonella expression cassettes and vaccines are also known and include the nirB promoter, the osmC promoter, P(pagC), and P(tac) (see, e.g., Bumann, <i>Infect. Immun. </i>69:7493-500 (2001); Wang et al., Vaccine, 17:1-12 (1999); McSorley et al., Infect. Immun. 65:171-8 (1997)). A variety of <i>E. coli </i>promoters are also known to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
    <p num="p-0241">In some embodiments, the promoter used in an expression cassette described herein is a constitutive promoter. In other embodiments, the promoter used in an expression cassettes described herein is an inducible promoter. The inducible promoter can be induced by a molecule (e.g., a protein) endogenous to the bacteria in which the expression cassette is to be used. Alternatively, the inducible promoter can be induced by a molecule (e.g. a small molecule or protein) heterologous to the bacteria in which the expression cassette is to be used. A variety of inducible promoters are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
    <p num="p-0242">In some embodiments of the expression cassettes, at the 3′-end of the promoter is a poly-purine Shine-Dalgarno sequence, the element required for engagement of the 30S ribosomal subunit (via 16S rRNA) to the heterologous gene RNA transcript and initiation of translation. The Shine-Dalgarno sequence has typically the following consensus sequence: 5′-NAGGAGGU-N<sub>5-10</sub>-AUG (start codon)-3′ (SEQ ID NO:85; SEQ ID NOS:125-129). There are variations of the poly-purine Shine-Dalgarno sequence. Notably, the <i>Listeria </i>hly gene that encodes listerolysin O (LLO) has the following Shine-Dalgarno sequence: AAGGAGAGTGAAACCCATG (SEQ ID NO:70) (Shine-Dalgarno sequence is underlined, and the translation start codon is bolded).</p>

    <p num="p-0244">In some embodiments, it is desirable to construct expression cassettes that utilize bicistronic, polycistronic (also known as multicistronic) expression of heterologous coding sequences. Such expression cassettes can utilize, for example, a single promoter that is operably linked to two or more independent coding sequences. These coding sequences can, for example, correspond to individual genes or can, alternatively, correspond to desired and/or selected sub-fragments of a whole designated gene. In this later example, a gene might contain a sequence encoding a hydrophobic trans-membrane domain, which may potentially inhibit efficient secretion from <i>Listeria</i>. Thus, it may be desirable to segregate in two sub-fragments the coding sequence of this gene from the hydrophobic domain; in this instance the two sub-fragments are then expressed as a bicistronic message. Utilization of polycistronic expression requires that the 30s ribosome subunit stay on the polycistronic RNA message following translation termination of the first coding sequence and release of the 50s ribosome sub-unit, and subsequently “read-through” the RNA message to the next initiation codon, during which the 50s ribosome sub-unit binds to the RNA-bound 30s ribosome subunit, and re-initiating translation.</p>
    <p num="p-0245"> <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>, like other bacteria, utilizes polycistronic expression of its genomic repertoire. By way of example, the sequence of a <i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>intergenic region from a selected polycistronic message can be used to construct polycistronic expression cassettes for expression of a selected heterologous protein from recombinant <i>Listeria </i>species. For example, several of the prfA-dependent virulence factors from <i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>are expressed from polycistronic message. For instance, the <i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>ActA and PlcB proteins are expressed as a bicistronic message. The DNA sequence corresponding to the <i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>actA-plcB intergenic sequence (5′-3′) is shown below</p>

(The Shine-Dalgarno sequence for translation initiation of plcB is shown in bold. The first 3 nucleotides of the sequence correspond to an Ochre stop codon.) For a non-limiting example of a bicistronic expression vector, a bicistronic hEphA2 expression vector for use in <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>, see Example 28, below.
</p>
    <p num="p-0247">Alternatively, other known intergenic or synthetic sequences can be used to construct polycistronic expression cassettes for use in <i>Listeria </i>or other bacteria. Construction of intergenic regions which lead to substantial secondary RNA structure should be prevented, to avoid unwanted transcription termination by a rho-independent mechanism.</p>
    <p num="p-0248">Importantly, if secretion of any or all translated proteins expressed from the polycistronic message is desired, signal peptides must be functionally linked to each coding region. In some embodiments, these signal peptides differ from each other.</p>
    <p num="p-0249">Thus, in some embodiments, the expression cassettes described herein for use in <i>Listeria </i>or other bacteria are polycistronic (e.g., bicistronic). Two or more polypeptides are encoded by the bicistronic or polycistronic expression cassettes as discrete polypeptides. In some embodiments, the bicistronic or polycistronic expression cassettes comprise an intergenic sequence (e.g., from a bicistronic or polycistronic gene) positioned between the coding sequences of the two polypeptides. In some embodiments, the intergenic sequence comprises a sequence which promotes ribosomal entry and initiation of translation. In some embodiments, the intergenic sequence comprises a Shine-Dalgarno sequence. In some embodiments, the intergenic sequence is the <i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>actA-plcB intergenic sequence. Typically, the intergenic sequence is positioned between a polynucleotide sequence encoding a first polypeptide (or a first fusion protein comprising a first polypeptide and a signal peptide) and a polynucleotide sequence encoding a second polypeptide (or a second fusion protein comprising a second polypeptide and signal peptide).</p>
    <p num="p-0250">Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention provides an expression cassette comprising the following: (a) a first polynucleotide encoding a first polypeptide; (b) a second polynucleotide encoding a second polypeptide; (c) an intergenic sequence positioned between the first and second polynucleotides; and (f) a promoter operably linked to the first and second polynucleotides, wherein the expression cassette encodes the first and second polypeptides as two discrete polypeptides. In some embodiments, the first and second polypeptides are polypeptides selected from any of the polypeptides described herein (e.g., in Section IV, above). In some embodiments, at least one of the first or second polypeptides comprises an antigen. In some embodiments, the first and second polynucleotides each comprise a (different or the same) fragment of the same antigen. In some embodiments, the antigen is a tumor-associated antigen or is derived from a tumor-associated-antigen.</p>
    <p num="p-0251">The invention further provides an expression cassette comprising the following: (a) a first polynucleotide encoding a first signal peptide; (b) a second polynucleotide encoding a first (non-signal) polypeptide, wherein the second polynucleotide is in the same translational reading frame as the first polynucleotide; (c) a third polynucleotide encoding a second signal peptide; (d) a fourth polynucleotide encoding a second (non-signal) polypeptide, wherein the fourth polynucleotide is in the same translational reading frame as the third polynucleotide; (e) an intergenic sequence (typically positioned between the second polynucleotide and the third polynucleotide); and (f) a promoter operably linked to the first polynucleotide, second polynucleotide, third polynucleotide, and fourth polynucleotide, so that the expression cassette encodes both a first fusion protein comprising the first signal peptide and the first polypeptide and a second fusion protein comprising the second signal peptide and second polypeptide. In some embodiments, the one or more of the polynucleotides encoding a signal peptide is codon-optimized for expression in a bacterium. In some embodiments, the third and/or fourth polynucleotides are codon-optimized for expression in a bacterium (preferably in addition to codon-optimization of the polynucleotides encoding the signal peptides). In some embodiments, the first and/or second signal peptide is a non-secA1 bacterial signal peptide. In some embodiments, the intergenic sequence is the <i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>actA-plcB intergenic sequence. In some embodiments, the second and third polypeptides are polypeptides selected from any of the polypeptides described herein (e.g., in Section IV, above), such as polypeptides comprising antigens. In some embodiments, the first and second polypeptides are polypeptides selected from any of the polypeptides described herein (e.g., in Section IV, above). In some embodiments, at least one of the first or second polypeptides comprises an antigen. In some embodiments, the first and second polynucleotides each comprise a fragment of the same antigen. In some embodiments, the antigen is a tumor-associated antigen or is derived from a tumor-associated-antigen.</p>
    <p num="p-0252">For instance, the invention provides a polycistronic expression cassette for expression of heterologous polypeptides in <i>Listeria</i>, wherein the expression cassette encodes at least two discrete non-Listerial polypeptides. In some embodiments, the polycistronic expression cassette is a bicistronic expression cassette which encodes two discrete non-Listerial polypeptides. In some embodiments, the expression cassette comprises the following: (a) a first polynucleotide encoding a first non-Listerial polypeptide; (b) a second polynucleotide encoding a second non-Listerial polypeptide; (c) an intergenic sequence positioned between the first and second polynucleotides; and (d) a promoter operably linked to the first and second polynucleotides, wherein the expression cassette encodes the first and second polypeptides as two discrete polypeptides. If the expression cassette is a polycistronic expression cassette that encodes three polypeptides as discrete polypeptides, the expression cassette will comprise a third polynucleotide operably linked to the promoter and a second intergenic sequence positioned between the second and third polynucleotide. In some embodiments, at least one of the non-Listerial polypeptides comprises an antigen. In some embodiments, at least two of the non-Listerial polypeptides each comprises a fragment of the same antigen.</p>
    <p num="p-0253">In some embodiments, the expression cassette comprises the following: (a) a first polynucleotide encoding a first signal peptide; (b) a second polynucleotide encoding a first (non-signal) non-Listerial polypeptide, wherein the second polynucleotide is in the same translational reading frame as the first polynucleotide; (c) a third polynucleotide encoding a second signal peptide; (d) a fourth polynucleotide encoding a second (non-signal) non-Listerial polypeptide, wherein the fourth polynucleotide is in the same translational reading frame as the third polynucleotide; (e) an intergenic sequence positioned between the second polynucleotide and the third polynucleotide; and (f) a promoter operably linked to the first polynucleotide, second polynucleotide, third polynucleotide, and fourth polynucleotide, so that the expression cassette encodes both a first fusion protein comprising the first signal peptide and the first polypeptide and a second fusion protein comprising the second signal peptide and second polypeptide.

    <p num="p-0254">The invention also provides a method of using any of the expression cassettes described herein to produce a recombinant bacterium (e.g. a recombinant <i>Listeria </i>bacterium). In some embodiments, the method of using an expression cassette described herein to make a recombinant bacterium comprises introducing the expression cassette into a bacterium. In some embodiments, the expression cassette is integrated into the genome of the bacterium. In some other embodiments, the expression cassette is on a plasmid which is incorporated within the bacterium. In some embodiments, incorporation of the expression cassette into the bacterium occurs by conjugation. The introduction of the expression cassette into the bacterium can be effected by any of the standard techniques known in the art. For instance, incorporation of the expression cassette into the bacterium can occur by conjugation, transduction (transfection), or transformation.</p>
    <heading>VII. Vectors</heading> <p num="p-0255">The invention further provides vectors, such as expression vectors, which comprise any one of the expression cassettes and/or recombinant nucleic acid molecules described herein. In some embodiments, the vector is a plasmid. In some embodiments, the vector is linear. In some embodiments, the vector is circular. In some embodiments, the vector is an integration or homologous recombinant vector. In some embodiments, the vector is pAM401. In some embodiments, the vector is pPL2. In some embodiments, the vector is isolated.</p>
    <p num="p-0256">As indicated above, in some embodiments, an expression cassette described herein is contained within an expression vector. In some embodiments, the vector is a plasmid. In other embodiments the vector is linear. In alternative embodiments, the expression cassette is inserted (i.e. integrated) within genomic DNA of a bacterium using an expression vector. In some embodiments, the expression vector is linear. In other embodiments, the expression vector is circular.</p>
    <p num="p-0257">Expression vectors suitable for use in bacteria such as <i>Listeria </i>are known to those skill in the art. There are a variety of suitable vectors suitable for use as a plasmid construct backbone for assembly of the expression cassettes. A particular plasmid construct backbone is selected based on whether expression of the polynucleotide (i.e., a polynucleotide encoding a heterologous antigen) from the bacterial chromosome or from an extra-chromosomal episome is desired.</p>
    <p num="p-0258">In some embodiments, incorporation of the expression cassette (and/or recombinant nucleic acid molecule) into the bacterial chromosome of <i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>(<i>Listeria</i>) is accomplished with an integration vector that contains an expression cassette for a listeriophage integrase that catalyzes sequence-specific integration of the vector into the <i>Listeria </i>chromosome. For example, the integration vectors known as pPL1 and pPL2 program stable single-copy integration of a heterologous protein expression cassette within an innocuous region of the bacterial genome, and have been described in the literature (Lauer et. al. 2002 J. Bacteriol. 184:4177-4178; U.S. patent Publication No. 20030203472). The integration vectors are stable as plasmids in <i>E. coli </i>and are introduced via conjugation into the desired <i>Listeria </i>background. Each vector lacks a <i>Listeria</i>-specific origin of replication and encodes a phage integrase, such that the vectors are stable only upon integration into a chromosomal phage attachment site. Starting with a desired plasmid construct, the process of generating a recombinant <i>Listeria </i>strain expressing a desired protein(s) takes approximately one week. The pPL1 and pPL2 integration vectors are based, respectively, on the U153 and PSA listeriophages. The pPL1 vector integrates within the open reading frame of the comK gene, while pPL2 integrates within the tRNAArg gene in such a manner that the native sequence of the gene is restored upon successful integration, thus keeping its native expressed function intact. The pPL1 and pPL2 integration vectors contain a multiple cloning site sequence in order to facilitate construction of plasmids containing a recombinant nucleic acid molecule or an expression cassette such as the heterologous protein expression cassette. Some specific examples of the use of the pPL2 integration vector are described in Example 2 and Example 3, below.</p>
    <p num="p-0259">Alternatively, incorporation of the expression cassette (and/or recombinant nucleic acid molecule) into the <i>Listeria </i>chromosome can be accomplished through allelic exchange methods, known to those skilled in the art. In particular, compositions in which it is desired to not incorporate a gene encoding an antibiotic resistance protein as part of the construct containing the expression cassette, methods of allelic exchange are desirable. For example, the pKSV7 vector (Camilli et. al. <i>Mol. Microbiol</i>. (1993) 8, 143-157), contains a temperature-sensitive <i>Listeria </i>Gram-positive replication origin which is exploited to select for recombinant clones at the non-permissive temperature that represent the pKSV7 plasmid recombined into the <i>Listeria </i>chromosome. The pKSV7 allelic exchange plasmid vector contains a multiple cloning site sequence in order to facilitate construction of plasmids containing the protein expression cassette, and also a chloramphenicol resistance gene. For insertion into the <i>Listeria </i>chromosome, the expression cassette construct may be flanked by approximately 1 kb of chromosomal DNA sequence that corresponds to the precise location of desired integration. The pKSV7-expression cassette plasmid may be introduced into a desired bacterial strain by electroporation, according to standard methods for electroporation of Gram positive bacteria. A non-limiting example of a method of effecting allelic exchange using the pKSV7 vector is provided in Example 16 below.</p>
    <p num="p-0260">In other embodiments, it may be desired to express the polypeptide (including a fusion protein comprising a polypeptide) from a stable plasmid episome. Maintenance of the plasmid episome through passaging for multiple generations requires the co-expression of a protein that confers a selective advantage for the plasmid-containing bacterium. As non-limiting examples, the protein co-expressed from the plasmid in combination with the polypeptide may be an antibiotic resistance protein, for example chloramphenicol, or may be a bacterial protein (that is expressed from the chromosome in wild-type bacteria), that can also confer a selective advantage. Non-limiting examples of bacterial proteins include enzyme required for purine or amino acid biosynthesis (selected using defined media lacking relevant amino acids or other necessary precursor macromolecules), or a transcription factor required for the expression of genes that confer a selective advantage in vitro or in vivo (Gunn et. al. 2001 J. Immuol. 167:6471-6479). As a non-limiting example, pAM401 is a suitable plasmid for episomal expression of a selected polypeptide in diverse Gram-positive bacterial genera (Wirth et. al. 1986 J. Bacteriol 165:831-836). For further description of exemplary uses of pAM401, see Examples 3 and 13, below.</p>
    <p num="p-0261">Incorporation of the expression cassette into the bacterial chromosome of <i>B. anthracis </i>can, for instance, be accomplished with an integration vector that contains an expression cassette for a phage integrase that catalyzes sequence-specific integration of the vector into the <i>B. anthracis </i>chromosome. The integrase and attachment site of a <i>B. anthracis </i>phage can be used to derive an integration vector, to incorporate desired antigen expression cassettes into the vaccine composition. As a non-limiting example, the integrase and attachment site from the <i>B. anthracis </i>temperate phage w-alpha is used to derive a <i>B. anthracis </i>specific integration vector (McCloy, E. W. 1951. Studies on a lysogenic <i>Bacillus </i>stain. I. A bacteriophage specific for <i>Bacillus anthracis</i>. J. Hyg. 49:114-125).</p>
    <p num="p-0262">Alternatively, incorporation of an antigen expression cassette into the <i>B. anthracis </i>chromosome can be accomplished through allelic exchange methods, known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Gat et al., <i>Infect. Immun., </i>71:801-13 (2003). In particular, compositions in which it is desired to not incorporate a gene encoding an antibiotic resistance protein as part of the construct containing the expression cassette, methods of allelic exchange are desirable. For example, the pKSV7 vector (Camilli et. al. <i>Mol. Microbiol. </i>1993 8, 143-157), contains a temperature-sensitive <i>Listeria</i>-derived Gram positive replication origin which is exploited to select for recombinant clones at the non-permissive temperature that represent the pKSV7 plasmid recombined into the bacterial chromosome. The pKSV7 allelic exchange plasmid vector contains a multiple cloning site sequence in order to facilitate construction of plasmids containing the expression cassette, and also a chloramphenicol resistance gene.

The pKSV7-expression cassette plasmid may be introduced into a desired bacterial strain by electroporation, according to standard methods for electroporation of Gram positive bacteria. A non-limiting example of a method of effecting allelic exchange in <i>B. anthracis </i>is provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/883,599, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. In particular, allelic exchange using the pKSV7 vector can be used in strains of <i>B. anthracis </i>to add a desired antigen expression cassette at any desired location within the bacterial chromosome.</p>

In some embodiments, the mutations are naturally-occurring. In other embodiments, the mutations are the results of artificial mutation pressure. In still other embodiments, the mutations in the bacterial genome are the result of genetic engineering.</p>
    <p num="p-0271">In some embodiments, the bacteria comprising any one of the recombinant nucleic acid molecules, expression cassettes and/or vectors described herein are attenuated for cell-to-cell spread, entry into non-phagocytic cells, or proliferation (relative to the wild-type bacteria). The bacteria may be attenuated by mutation or by other modifications.

    <p num="p-0272">In some embodiments, the bacteria comprising the expression cassettes and/or expression vectors described herein are attenuated for cell-to-cell spread. In some embodiments, the bacteria (e.g., <i>Listeria</i>) are defective with respect to ActA (relative to the non-mutant or wildtype bacteria), or its equivalent (depending on the organism). In some embodiments, the bacteria comprise one or more mutation in actA. For instance, the bacterium (e.g., <i>Listeria</i>) may be an actA deletion mutant. ActA is the actin polymerase encoded by the actA gene (Kocks, et al., <i>Cell, </i>68:521-531 (1992); Genbank accession no. AL591974, nts 9456-11389). The actin polymerase protein is involved in the recruitment and polymerization of host F-actin at one pole of the <i>Listeria </i>bacterium. Subsequent polymerization and dissolution of actin results in <i>Listeria </i>propulsion throughout the cytosol and into neighboring cells. This mobility enables the bacteria to spread directly from cell-to-cell without further exposure to the extracellular environment, thus escaping host defenses such as antibody development. In some embodiments, the attenuated <i>Listeria </i>optionally comprises both a mutation in an internalin gene, such as inlB, and in actA. The <i>Listeria </i>strain of this embodiment of the present invention is attenuated for entry into non-phagocytic cells as well as attenuated for cell-to-cell spreading.</p>
    <p num="p-0273">In some embodiments, the capacity of the attenuated bacterium for cell-to-cell spread is reduced by at least about 10%, at least about 25%, at least about 50%, at least about 75%, or at least about 90%, relative to a bacterium without the attenuating mutation (e.g., the wild type bacterium). In some embodiments, the capacity of the attenuated bacterium for cell-to-cell spread is reduced by at least about 25% relative to a bacterium without the attenuating mutation. In some embodiments, the capacity of the attenuated bacterium attenuated for cell-to-cell spread is reduced by at least about 50% relative to a bacterium without the attenuating mutation.</p>
    <p num="p-0274">In vitro assays for determining whether or not a bacterium such as a <i>Listeria </i>bacterium is attenuated for cell-to-cell spread are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, the diameter of plaques formed over a time course after infection of selected cultured cell monolayers can be measured. Plaque assays within L2 cell monolayers can be performed as described previously in Sun, A., A. Camilli, and D. A. Portnoy. 1990, Isolation of <i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>small-plaque mutants defective for intracellular growth and cell-to-cell spread. <i>Infect. Immun. </i>58:3770-3778, with modifications to the methods of measurement, as described by in Skoble, J., D. A. Portnoy, and M. D. Welch. 2000, Three regions within ActA promote Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin nucleation and <i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>motility. <i>J. Cell Biol. </i>150:527-538. In brief, L2 cells are grown to confluency in six-well tissue culture dishes and then infected with bacteria for 1 h. Following infection, the cells are overlayed with media warmed to 40° C. that is comprised of DME containing 0.8% agarose, Fetal Bovine Serum (e.g., 2%), and a desired concentration of Gentamicin. The concentration of Gentamicin in the media dramatically affects plaque size, and is a measure of the ability of a selected <i>Listeria </i>strain to effect cell-to-cell spread (Glomski, I J., M. M. Gedde, A. W. Tsang, J. A. Swanson, and D. A. Portnoy. 2002. <i>J. Cell Biol. </i>156:1029-1038). For example, at 3 days following infection of the monolayer the plaque size of <i>Listeria </i>strains having a phenotype of defective cell-to-cell spread is reduced by at least 50% as compared to wild-type <i>Listeria</i>, when overlayed with media containing Gentamicin at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. On the otherhand, the plaque size between <i>Listeria </i>strains having a phenotype of defective cell-to-cell spread and wild-type <i>Listeria </i>is similar, when infected monolayers are overlayed with media+agarose containing only 5 μg/ml gentamicin. Thus, the relative ability of a selected strain to effect cell-to-cell spread in an infected cell monolayer relative to wild-type <i>Listeria </i>can be determined by varying the concentration of gentamicin in the media containing agarose. Optionally, visualization and measurement of plaque diameter can be facilitated by the addition of media containing Neutral Red (GIBCO BRL; 1:250 dilution in DME+agarose media) to the overlay at 48 h. post infection. Additionally, the plaque assay can be performed in monolayers derived from other primary cells or continuous cells. For example HepG2 cells, a hepatocyte-derived cell line, or primary human hepatocytes can be used to evaluate the ability of selected <i>Listeria </i>mutants to effect cell-to-cell spread, as compared to wild-type <i>Listeria</i>. In some embodiments, <i>Listeria </i>comprising mutations or other modifications that attenuate the <i>Listeria </i>for cell-to-cell spread produce “pinpoint” plaques at high concentrations of gentamicin (about 50 μg/ml).</p>
    <p num="p-0275">In some embodiments, the bacteria comprising the expression cassettes and/or expression vectors described herein are mutant bacteria that are attenuated for nucleic acid repair (relative to wildtype such as bacteria without the attenuating genetic mutation). For instance, in some embodiments, the bacteria are defective with respect to at least one DNA repair enzyme (e.g., <i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>uvrAB mutants). In some embodiments, the bacteria are defective with respect to PhrB, UvrA, UvrB, UvrC, UvrD, and/or RecA, or one of their equivalents (depending on the genus and species of the bacteria). In some embodiments, the bacteria are defective with respect to UvrA, UvrB, and/or UvrC. In some embodiments, the bacteria comprise attenuating mutations in phrB, uvrA, uvrB, uvrC, uvrD, and/or recA genes. In some embodiments, the bacteria comprise one or more mutations in the uvrA, uvrB, and/or uvrC genes. In some embodiments, the bacteria are functionally deleted in UvrA, UvrB, and/or UvrC. In some embodiments, the bacteria are deleted in functional UvrA and UvrB. In some embodiments, the bacteria are uvrAB deletion mutants. In some embodiments, the bacteria are ΔuvrABΔactA mutants. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid of the bacteria which are attenuated for nucleic acid repair and/or are defective with respect to at least one DNA repair enzyme are modified by reaction with a nucleic acid targeting compound (see below). Nucleic acid repair mutants, such as ΔuvrAB <i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>mutants, and methods of making the mutants, are described in detail in U.S. patent Publication No. 2004/0197343 (see, e.g., Example 7 of U.S. 2004/0197343).</p>
    <p num="p-0276">In some embodiments, the capacity of the attenuated bacterium for nucleic acid repair is reduced by at least about 10%, at least about 25%, at least about 50%, at least about 75%, or at least about 90%, relative to a bacterium without the attenuating mutation (e.g., the wild type bacterium). In some embodiments, the capacity of the attenuated bacterium for nucleic acid repair is reduced by at least about 25% relative a bacterium without the attenuating mutation. In some embodiments, the capacity of the attenuated bacterium attenuated for nucleic acid repair is reduced by at least about 50% relative a bacterium without the attenuating mutation.</p>
    <p num="p-0277">Confirmation that a particular mutation is present in a bacterial strain can be obtained through a variety of methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For instance, the relevant portion of the strain's genome can be cloned and sequenced. Alternatively, specific mutations can be identified via PCR using paired primers that code for regions adjacent to a deletion or other mutation. Southern blots can also be used to detect changes in the bacterial genome. Also, one can analyze whether a particular protein is expressed by the strain using techniques standard to the art such as Western blotting. Confirmation that the strain contains a mutation in the desired gene may also be obtained through comparison of the phenotype of the strain with a previously reported phenotype. For example, the presence of a nucleotide excision repair mutation such as deletion of uvrAB can be assessed using an assay which tests the ability of the bacteria to repair its nucleic acid using the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery and comparing that ability against wild-type bacteria. Such functional assays are known in the art. For instance, cyclobutane dimer excision or the excision of UV-induced (6-4) products can be measured to determine a deficiency in an NER enzyme in the mutant (see, e.g., Franklin et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </i>81: 3821-3824 (1984)). Alternatively, survival measurements can be made to assess a deficiency in nucleic acid repair. For instance, the bacteria can be subjected to psoralen/UVA treatment and then assessed for their ability to proliferate and/or survive in comparison to wild-type.</p>
    <p num="p-0278">In some embodiments, the bacterium is attenuated for entry into non-phagocytic cells (relative or a non-mutant or wildtype bacterium). In some embodiments, the bacterium (e.g., <i>Listeria</i>) is defective with respect to one or more internalins (or equivalents). In some embodiments, the bacterium is defective with respect to internalin A. In some embodiments, the bacterium is defective with respect to internalin B. In some embodiments, the bacterium comprises a mutation in inlA. In some embodiments, the bacterium comprises a mutation in inlB. In some embodiments, the bacterium comprises a mutation in both actA and inlb. In some embodiments, the bacterium is deleted in functional ActA and internalinB. In some embodiments, the bacterium is an ΔactAΔinlB double deletion mutant. In some embodiments, the bacterium is defective with respect to both ActA and internalin B.</p>
    <p num="p-0279">In some embodiments, the capacity of the attenuated bacterium for entry into non-phagocytic cells is reduced by at least about 10%, at least about 25%, at least about 50%, at least about 75%, or at least about 90%, relative to a bacterium without the attenuating mutation (e.g., the wild type bacterium). In some embodiments, the capacity of the attenuated bacterium for entry into non-phagocytic cells is reduced by at least about 25% relative to a bacterium without the attenuating mutation. In some embodiments, the capacity of the attenuated bacterium for entry into non-phagocytic cells is reduced by at least about 50% relative to a bacterium without the attenuating mutation. In some embodiments, the capacity of the attenuated bacterium for entry into non-phagocytic cells is reduced by at least about 75% relative to a bacterium without the attenuating mutation.</p>
    <p num="p-0280">In some embodiments, the attenuated bacteria, such as a mutant <i>Listeria </i>strain, are not attenuated for entry into more than one type of non-phagocytic cell. For instance, the attenuated strain may be attenuated for entry into hepatocytes, but not attenuated for entry into epithelial cells. As another example, the attenuated strain may be attenuated for entry into epithelial cells, but not hepatocytes. It is also understood that attenuation for entry into a non-phagocytic cell of particular modified bacteria is a result of mutating a designated gene, for example a deletion mutation, encoding an invasin protein which interacts with a particular cellular receptor, and as a result facilitates infection of a non-phagocytic cell. For example, <i>Listeria </i>ΔinlB mutant strains are attenuated for entry into non-phagocytic cells expressing the hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-met), including hepatocyte cell lines (e.g., HepG2), and primary human hepatocytes.</p>
    <p num="p-0281">In some embodiments, even though the bacteria (e.g., mutant <i>Listeria</i>) are attenuated for entry into non-phagocytic cells, the <i>Listeria </i>are still capable of uptake by phagocytic cells, such as at least dendritic cells and/or macrophages. In one embodiment the ability of the attenuated bacteria to enter phagocytic cells is not diminished by the modification made to the strain, such as the mutation of an invasin (i.e. approximately 95% or more of the measured ability of the strain to be taken up by phagocytic cells is maintained post-modification). In other embodiments, the ability of the attenuated bacteria to enter phagocytic cells is diminished by no more than about 10%, no more than about 25%, no more than about 50%, or no more than about 75%.</p>
    <p num="p-0282">In some embodiments of the invention, the amount of attenuation in the ability of the bacterium (e.g., a <i>Listeria </i>bacterium) to enter non-phagocytic cells ranges from a two-fold reduction to much greater levels of attenuation. In some embodiments, the attenuation in the ability of the bacteria to enter non-phagocytic cells is at least about 0.3 log, about 1 log, about 2 log, about 3 log, about 4 log, about 5 log, or at least about 6 log. In some embodiments, the attenuation is in the range of about 0.3 to &gt;8 log, about 2 to &gt;8 log, about 4 to &gt;8 log, about 6 to &gt;8 log, about 0.3-8 log, also about 0.3-7 log, also about 0.3-6 log, also about 0.3-5 log, also about 0.3-4 log, also about 0.3-3 log, also about 0.3-2 log, also about 0.3-1 log. In some embodiments, the attenuation is in the range of about 1 to &gt;8 log, 1-7 log, 1-6 log, also about 2-6 log, also about 2-5 log, also about 3-5 log.</p>
    <p num="p-0283">A number of internalins have been identified in <i>L. monocytogenes </i>(Boland, et al., <i>Clinical Microbiology Reviews, </i>2001, 14: 584-640).

For instance, the sequences for both inlA and inlB have been reported in Gaillard et al., <i>Cell, </i>65:1127-1141 (1991) and as GenBank accession number M67471. Genes encoding additional members of the internalin-related protein family are identified in Web Table 2 of the Supplementary Web material of Glaser et al., <i>Science, </i>294:849-852 (2001), including lmo0327, lmo0331, lmo0514, lmo0610, lmo0732, lmo1136, lmo1289, lmo2396, Imo0171, lmo0333, lmo0801, lmo1290, lmo2026, and lmo2821.

    <p num="p-0287">In vitro assays for determining whether or not a bacterium (e.g., a mutant <i>Listeria </i>strain) is attenuated for entry into non-phagocytic cells are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For instance, both Dramsi et al., <i>Molecular Microbiology </i>16:251-261 (1995) and Gaillard et al., <i>Cell </i>65:1127-1141 (1991) describe assays for screening the ability of mutant <i>L. monocytogenes </i>strains to enter certain cell lines. For instance, to determine whether a <i>Listeria </i>bacterium with a particular modification is attenuated for entry into a particular type of non-phagocytic cells, the ability of the attenuated <i>Listeria </i>bacterium to enter a particular type of non-phagocytic cell is determined and compared to the ability of the identical <i>Listeria </i>bacterium without the modification to enter non-phagocytic cells. Likewise, to determine whether a <i>Listeria </i>strain with a particular mutation is attenuated for entry into a particular type of non-phagocytic cells, the ability of the mutant <i>Listeria </i>strain to enter a particular type of non-phagocytic cell is determined and compared to the ability of the <i>Listeria </i>strain without the mutation to enter non-phagocytic cells. In addition, confirmation that the strain is defective with respect to internalin B may also be obtained through comparison of the phenotype of the strain with the previously reported phenotypes for internalin B mutants.</p>
    <p num="p-0288">In some embodiments, the attenuation of bacteria can be measured in terms of biological effects of the <i>Listeria </i>on a host. The pathogenicity of a bacterial strain can be assessed by measurement of the LD<sub>50 </sub>in mice or other vertebrates. The LD<sub>50 </sub>is the amount, or dosage, of <i>Listeria </i>injected into vertebrates necessary to cause death in 50% of the vertebrates. The LD<sub>50 </sub>values can be compared for bacteria having a particular modification (e.g., mutation) versus the bacteria without the particular modification as a measure of the level of attenuation. For example, if the bacterial strain without a particular mutation has an LD<sub>50 </sub>of 10<sup>3 </sup>bacteria and the bacterial strain having the particular mutation has an LD<sub>50 </sub>of 10<sup>5 </sup>bacteria, the strain has been attenuated so that is LD<sub>50 </sub>is increased 100-fold or by 2 log.</p>
    <p num="p-0289">Alternatively, the degree of attenuation of the ability of a bacterium (e.g., a <i>Listeria </i>bacterium) to infect non-phagocytic cells can be assessed much more directly in vitro. For instance, the ability of a modified <i>Listeria </i>bacterium to infect non-phagocytic cells, such as hepatocytes, can be compared to the ability of non-modified <i>Listeria </i>or wild type <i>Listeria </i>to infect phagocytic cells. In such an assay, the modified and non-modified <i>Listeria </i>are typically added to the non-phagocytic cells in vitro for a limited period of time (for instance, an hour), the cells are then washed with a gentamicin-containing solution to kill any extracellular bacteria, the cells are lysed and then plated to assess titer. Examples of such an assay are found in U.S. patent publication No. 2004/0228877.</p>
    <p num="p-0290">As a further example, the degree of attenuation may also be measured qualitatively by other biological effects, such as the extent of tissue pathology or serum liver enzyme levels. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin and bilirubin levels in the serum are determined at a clinical laboratory for mice injected with <i>Listeria </i>(or other bacteria). Comparisons of these effects in mice or other vertebrates can be made for <i>Listeria </i>with and without particular modifications/mutations as a way to assess the attenuation of the <i>Listeria</i>. Attenuation of the <i>Listeria </i>may also be measured by tissue pathology. The amount of <i>Listeria </i>that can be recovered from various tissues of an infected vertebrate, such as the liver, spleen and nervous system, can also be used as a measure of the level of attenuation by comparing these values in vertebrates injected with mutant versus non-mutant <i>Listeria</i>. For instance, the amount of <i>Listeria </i>that can be recovered from infected tissues such as liver or spleen as a function of time can be used as a measure of attenuation by comparing these values in mice injected with mutant vs. non-mutant <i>Listeria. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0291">Accordingly, the attenuation of the <i>Listeria </i>can be measured in terms of bacterial load in particular selected organs in mice known to be targets by wild-type <i>Listeria</i>. For example, the attenuation of the Listeria can be measured by enumerating the colonies (Colony Forming Units; CFU) arising from plating dilutions of liver or spleen homogenates (homogenized in H<sub>2</sub>O+0.2% NP40) on BHI agar media. The liver or spleen cfu can be measured, for example, over a time course following administration of the modified <i>Listeria </i>via any number of routes, including intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, and subcutaneous. Additionally, the <i>Listeria </i>can be measured and compared to a drug-resistant, wild type <i>Listeria </i>(or any other selected <i>Listeria </i>strain) in the liver and spleen (or any other selected organ) over a time course following administration by the competitive index assay, as described.</p>
    <p num="p-0292">The degree of attenuation in uptake of the attenuated bacteria by non-phagocytic cells need not be an absolute attenuation in order to provide a safe and effective vaccine. In some embodiments, the degree of attenuation is one that provides for a reduction in toxicity sufficient to prevent or reduce the symptoms of toxicity to levels that are not life threatening.</p>

An exemplary allelic exchange plasmid is pKSV7 described in Camilli et al., Molecular Microbiology, 8:143-147 (1993). As a first step in generating a mutant <i>Bacillus anthracis</i>, the region of the genome to be deleted or otherwise mutated and approximately 1000 bps both upstream and downstream of the <i>B. anthracis </i>genome is PCR-amplified and then cloned into the pKSV7 plasmid vector (or an analogous vector). (A <i>Bacillus </i>genera-specific or <i>B. anthracis</i>-specific temperature (ts) replicon may be substituted for the <i>Listeria </i>ts replicon present in the pKSV7 allelic exchange plasmid vector.) Restriction endonuclease recognition sites in the region to be deleted or mutated may be used to delete the desired portion of the targeted gene in the region. Alternatively, a portion of the targeted gene within the region may be removed and replaced with sequences containing the desired mutation or other alteration. The region of the <i>B. anthracis </i>genome that is amplified can be altered, for instance, using restriction enzymes or a combination of restriction enzymes and synthetic gene sequences, before or after cloning into the allelic exchange plasmid. In some embodiments, the sequence may be altered as a PCR amplicon and then cloned into pKSV7. In alternative embodiments, the amplicon is first inserted into another plasmid first and then altered, excised, and inserted into pKSV7. Alternatively, the PCR amplicon is inserted directly into the pKSV7 plasmid and then altered, for instance, using convenient restriction enzymes. The pKSV7 plasmid containing the altered sequence is then introduced into <i>B. anthracis</i>. This can be done via electroporation. The bacteria are then selected on media at a permissive temperature in the presence of chloramphenicol. This is followed by selection for single cross-over integration into the bacterial chromosome by passaging for multiple generations at a non-permissive temperature in the presence of chloramphenicol. Lastly, colonies are passaged for multiple generations at the permissive temperature in media not containing the antibiotic to achieve plasmid excision and curing (double cross-over).

Nos. 60/584,886, and 60/599,522, and U.S. patent Publication No. 2004/0197343, incorporated by reference herein in their entirety, provide additional description regarding the construction of different types of <i>Bacillus anthracis </i>mutants.</p>
    <p num="p-0298">In some embodiments of the invention, the bacterium that comprises the recombinant nucleic acid molecule, expression cassette, and/or expression vector is a bacterium that has been modified so that the bacterium is attenuated for proliferation (relative to the non-modified bacterium). Preferably, the modified bacterium maintains a sufficient level of gene expression despite the modification. For instance, in some embodiments the gene expression level is substantially unaffected by the modification so that an antigen is expressed at a level sufficient to stimulate an immune response to the antigen upon administration of the bacterium expressing the antigen to a host. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid of the bacterium has been modified by reaction with a nucleic acid targeting compound. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid of the modified bacterium has been modified by reaction with a nucleic acid targeting compound that reacts directly with the nucleic acid so that proliferation of the bacterium is attenuated. In some embodiments, the nucleic-acid targeting compound is a nucleic acid alkylator, such as β-alanine, N-(acridin-9-yl), 2-[bis(2-chloroethyl)amino]ethyl ester. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid targeting compound is activated by irradiation, such as UVA irradiation. In some embodiments, the bacterium has been treated with a psoralen compound. For instance, in some embodiments, the bacterium has been modified by treatment with a psoralen, such as 4′-(4-amino-2-oxa)butyl-4,5′,8-trimethylpsoralen (“S-59”), and UVA light. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid of the bacterium has been modified by treatment with a psoralen compound and UVA irradiation. Descriptions of methods of modifying bacteria to attenuate them for proliferation using nucleic acid targeting compounds are described in each of the following U.S. patent applications or publications, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety: 60/446,051 (filed Feb. 6, 2003), 60/449,153 (filed Feb. 21, 2003), 60/490,089 (filed Jul. 24, 2003), 60/511,869 (filed Oct. 15, 2003), 60/541,515 (filed Feb. 2, 2004), 10/883,599 (filed Jun. 30, 2004), and US 2004/0197343. Modified bacteria and their uses are also described in International Application No. PCT/US2004/23881, filed Jul. 23, 2004, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
    <p num="p-0299">For example, for treatment of ΔactAΔuvrAB <i>L. monocytogenes</i>, in some embodiments, S-59 psoralen can be added to 200 nM in a log-phase culture of (approximately) OD<sub>600</sub>=0.5, followed by inactivation with 6 J/m<sup>2 </sup>of UVA light when the culture reaches an optical density of one. Inactivation conditions are optimized by varying concentrations of S-59, UVA dose, the time of S-59 exposure prior to UVA treatment as well as varying the time of treatment during bacterial growth of the <i>Listeria </i>actA/uvrAB strain. The parental <i>Listeria </i>strain is used as a control. Inactivation of <i>Listeria </i>(log-kill) is determined by the inability of the bacteria to form colonies on BHI (Brain heart infusion) agar plates. In addition, one can confirm the expression of a heterologous protein and virulence factors, such as LLO and p60, of the S-59/UVA inactivated <i>Listeria </i>using <sup>35</sup>S-pulse-chase experiments to determine the synthesis and secretion of newly expressed proteins post S-59/UVA inactivation. Expression of LLO and p60 using <sup>35</sup>S-metabolic labeling can be routinely determined. S-59/UVA inactivated <i>Listeria </i>actA/uvrAB can be incubated for 1 hour in the presence of <sup>35</sup>S-Methionine. Antigen expression and secretion of the heterologous protein, endogenous LLO, and p60 can be determined of both whole cell lysates, and TCA precipitation of bacterial culture fluids. LLO-, p60- and heterologous protein-specific monoclonal antibodies can be used for immunoprecipitation to verify the continued expression and secretion from recombinant Listeria post inactivation.</p>

In particular compositions, the molecular mass of a given protein can inhibit its expression from recombinant bacteria, such as recombinant <i>Listeria</i>. One approach to address this problem is to molecularly “divide” the gene encoding a protein of interest and fuse each division functionally to a sequence that will program its secretion from the bacterium (e.g., secA1, secA2, or Tat elements). One approach is to individually derive recombinant <i>Listeria </i>expressing each division of the heterologous gene. Alternatively, the individually components of the molecularly divided gene (also including appropriate elements for secretion) can be introduced into intergenic regions throughout the bacterial chromosome, using methods well established in the art, for example by allelic exchange. Another example is to express the molecularly divided gene as a single polycistronic message. According to this composition, interspersed between the protein-encoding sequence of the molecularly divided gene would be the Shine-Dalgarno ribosome binding sequence, in order to re-initiate protein synthesis on the polycistronic message.</p>

    <p num="p-0352">It can be determined if a particular form of recombinant bacteria (and/or a particular expression cassette) is useful in an immunogenic composition (or as a vaccine) by testing the ability of the recombinant bacteria to stimulate an immune response in vitro or in a model system.</p>
    <p num="p-0353">These immune cell responses can be measured by both in vitro and in vivo methods to determine if the immune response of a particular recombinant bacterium (and/or a particular expression cassette) is effective. One possibility is to measure the presentation of the protein or antigen of interest by an antigen-presenting cell that has been mixed with a population of the recombinant bacteria. The recombinant bacteria may be mixed with a suitable antigen presenting cell or cell line, for example a dendritic cell, and the antigen presentation by the dendritic cell to a T cell that recognizes the protein or antigen can be measured. If the recombinant bacteria are expressing the protein or antigen at a sufficient level, it will be processed into peptide fragments by the dendritic cells and presented in the context of MHC class I or class II to T cells. For the purpose of detecting the presented protein or antigen, a T cell clone or T cell line responsive to the particular protein or antigen may be used. The T cell may also be a T cell hybridoma, where the T cell is immortalized by fusion with a cancer cell line. Such T cell hybridomas, T cell clones, or T cell lines can comprise either CD8+ or CD4+ T cells. The dendritic cell can present to either CD8+ or CD4+ T cells, depending on the pathway by which the antigens are processed. CD8+ T cells recognize antigens in the context of MHC class I while CD4+ recognize antigens in the context of MHC class II. The T cell will be stimulated by the presented antigen through specific recognition by its T cell receptor, resulting in the production of certain proteins, such as IL-2, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), or interferon-γ (IFN-γ), that can be quantitatively measured (for example, using an ELISA assay, ELISPOT assay, or Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS)). These are techniques that are well known in the art and that are also exemplified below in the Examples (see, e.g., Example 21, below).</p>
    <p num="p-0354">Alternatively, a hybridoma can be designed to include a reporter gene, such as β-galactosidase, that is activated upon stimulation of the T cell hybridoma by the presented antigens. The increase in the production of β-galactosidase can be readily measured by its activity on a substrate, such as chlorophenol red-B-galactoside, which results in a color change. The color change can be directly measured as an indicator of specific antigen presentation.</p>
    <p num="p-0355">Additional in vitro and in vivo methods for assessing the antigen expression of recombinant bacteria vaccines of the present invention are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. It is also possible to directly measure the expression of a particular heterologous antigen by recombinant bacteria. For example, a radioactively labeled amino acid can be added to a cell population and the amount of radioactivity incorporated into a particular protein can be determined. The proteins synthesized by the cell population can be isolated, for example by gel electrophoresis or capillary electrophoresis, and the amount of radioactivity can be quantitatively measured to assess the expression level of the particular protein. Alternatively, the proteins can be expressed without radioactivity and visualized by various methods, such as an ELISA assay or by gel electrophoresis and Western blot with detection using an enzyme linked antibody or fluorescently labeled antibody.</p>
    <p num="p-0356">Example 21, below, provides some specific exemplary examples of how some of the techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art can be used to assess immunogenicity. For instance, Elispot assay, Intracellular Cytokine Staining Assay (ICS), measurement of cytokine expression of stimulated spleen cells, and assessment of cytotoxic T cell activity in vitro and in vivo are all techniques for assessing immunogenicity known to those in the art. Exemplary descriptions of these techniques with model antigens are provided in Example 21. Exemplary assays are also described in Examples 31A and 31E, below.</p>
    <p num="p-0357">In addition, therapeutic efficacy of the vaccine composition can be assessed more directly by administration of the immunogenic composition or vaccine to an animal model such as a mouse model, followed by an assessment of survival or tumor growth. For instance, survival can be measured following administration and challenge (e.g., with a tumor or pathogen). See, e.g., the assays described in Examples 20 and 31B-D, below.)</p>
    <p num="p-0358">Mouse models useful for testing the immunogenicity of an immunogenic composition or vaccine expressing a particular antigen can be produced by first modifying a tumor cell so that it expresses the antigen of interest or a model antigen and then implanting the tumor cells expressing the antigen of interest into mice. The mice can be vaccinated with the candidate immunogenic composition or vaccine comprising a recombinant bacterium expressing a polypeptide comprising the antigen of interest or a model antigen prior to implantation of the tumor cells (to test prophylactic efficacy of the candidate composition) or following implantation of the tumor cells in the mice (to test therapeutic efficacy of the candidate composition).</p>
    <p num="p-0359">As an example, CT26 mouse murine colon carcinoma cells can be transfected with an appropriate vector comprising an expression cassette encoding the desired antigen or model antigen using techniques standard in the art. Standard techniques such as flow cytometry and Western blots can then be used to identify clones expressing the antigen or model antigen at sufficient levels for use in the immunogenicity and/or efficacy assays.</p>
    <p num="p-0360">Alternatively, candidate compositions can be tested which comprise a recombinant bacterium expressing an antigen that corresponds to or is derived from an antigen endogenous to a tumor cell line (e.g., the retroviral gp70 tumor antigen AH1 endogenous to CT26 mouse murine colon carcinoma cells, or the heteroclitic epitope AH1-A5). In such assays, the tumor cells can be implanted in the animal model without further modification to express an additional antigen. Candidate vaccines comprising the antigen can then be tested.</p>

    <p num="p-0393">The efficacy of the vaccines or other compositions for the treatment of a condition can be evaluated in an individual, for example in mice. A mouse model is recognized as a model for efficacy in humans and is useful in assessing and defining the vaccines of the present invention. The mouse model is used to demonstrate the potential for the effectiveness of the vaccines in any individual. Vaccines can be evaluated for their ability to provide either a prophylactic or therapeutic effect against a particular disease. For example, in the case of infectious diseases, a population of mice can be vaccinated with a desired amount of the appropriate vaccine of the invention, where the recombinant bacterium expresses an infectious disease associated antigen. The mice can be subsequently infected with the infectious agent related to the vaccine antigen and assessed for protection against infection. The progression of the infectious disease can be observed relative to a control population (either non vaccinated or vaccinated with vehicle only or a bacterium that does not contain the appropriate antigen).</p>
    <p num="p-0394">In the case of cancer vaccines, tumor cell models are available, where a tumor cell line expressing a desired tumor antigen can be injected into a population of mice either before (therapeutic model) or after (prophylactic model) vaccination with a composition comprising a bacterium of the invention containing the desired tumor antigen. Vaccination with a recombinant bacterium containing the tumor antigen can be compared to control populations that are either not vaccinated, vaccinated with vehicle, or with a recombinant bacterium that expresses an irrelevant antigen. The effectiveness of the vaccine in such models can be evaluated in terms of tumor volume as a function of time after tumor injection or in terms of survival populations as a function of time after tumor injection (e.g., Example 31D). In one embodiment, the tumor volume in mice vaccinated with a composition comprising the recombinant bacterium is about 5%, about 10%, about 25%, about 50%, about 75%, about 90% or about 100% less than the tumor volume in mice that are either not vaccinated or are vaccinated with vehicle or a bacterium that expresses an irrelevant antigen. In another embodiment, this differential in tumor volume is observed at least about 10, about 17, or about 24 days following the implant of the tumors into the mice. In one embodiment, the median survival time in the mice vaccinated with the composition comprising a recombinant bacterium is at least about 2, about 5, about 7 or at least about 10 days longer than in mice that are either not vaccinated or are vaccinated with vehicle or bacteria that express an irrelevant antigen.</p>
    <p num="p-0395">The host (i.e., subject) in the methods described herein, is any vertebrate, preferably a mammal, including domestic animals, sport animals, and primates, including humans. In some embodiments, the host is a mammal. In some embodiments, the host is a human.</p>
    <p num="p-0396">The delivery of the recombinant bacteria, or a composition comprising the strain, may be by any suitable method, such as intradermal, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intravenous, intramuscular, intralymphatic, oral or intranasal, as well as by any route that is relevant for any given malignant or infectious disease or other condition.</p>
    <p num="p-0397">The compositions comprising the recombinant bacteria and an immunostimulatory agent may be administered to a host simultaneously, sequentially or separately. Examples of immunostimulatory agents include, but are not limited to IL-2, IL-12, GMCSF, IL-15, B7.1, B7.2, and B7-DC and IL-14. Additional examples of stimulatory agents are provided in Section IX, above.</p>
    <p num="p-0398">As used herein, an “effective amount” of a bacterium or composition (such as a pharmaceutical composition or an immunogenic composition) is an amount sufficient to effect beneficial or desired results. For prophylactic use, beneficial or desired results includes results such as eliminating or reducing the risk, lessening the severity, or delaying the outset of the disease, including biochemical, histologic and/or behavioral symptoms of a disease, its complications and intermediate pathological phenotypes presenting during development of the disease. For therapeutic use, beneficial or desired results includes clinical results such as inhibiting or suppressing a disease, decreasing one or more symptoms resulting from a disease (biochemical, histologic and/or behavioral), including its complications and intermediate pathological phenotypes presenting during development of a disease, increasing the quality of life of those suffering from a disease, decreasing the dose of other medications required to treat the disease, enhancing effect of another medication, delaying the progression of the disease, and/or prolonging survival of patients. An effective amount can be administered in one or more administrations. For purposes of this invention, an effective amount of drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition is an amount sufficient to accomplish prophylactic or therapeutic treatment either directly or indirectly. As is understood in the clinical context, an effective amount of a drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition may or may not be achieved in conjunction with another drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition. Thus, an effective amount may be considered in the context of administering one or more therapeutic agents, and a single agent may be considered to be given in an effective amount if, in conjunction with one or more other agents, a desirable result may be or is achieved.</p>
    <p num="p-0399">In some embodiments, for a therapeutic treatment of a cancer, an effective amount includes an amount that will result in the desired immune response, wherein the immune response either slows the growth of the targeted tumors, reduces the size of the tumors, or preferably eliminates the tumors completely. The administration of the vaccine may be repeated at appropriate intervals, and may be administered simultaneously at multiple distinct sites in the vaccinated individual. In some embodiments, for a prophylactic treatment of a cancer, an effective amount includes a dose that will result in a protective immune response such that the likelihood of an individual to develop the cancer is significantly reduced. The vaccination regimen may be comprised of a single dose, or may be repeated at suitable intervals until a protective immune response is established.</p>
    <p num="p-0400">In some embodiments, the therapeutic treatment of an individual for cancer may be started on an individual who has been diagnosed with a cancer as an initial treatment, or may be used in combination with other treatments. For example, individuals who have had tumors surgically removed or who have been treated with radiation therapy or by chemotherapy may be treated with the vaccine in order to reduce or eliminate any residual tumors in the individual, or to reduce the risk of a recurrence of the cancer. In some embodiments, the prophylactic treatment of an individual for cancer, would be started on an individual who has an increased risk of contracting certain cancers, either due to environmental conditions or genetic predisposition.</p>
    <p num="p-0401">The dosage of the pharmaceutical compositions or vaccines that are given to the host will vary depending on the species of the host, the size of the host, and the condition or disease of the host. The dosage of the compositions will also depend on the frequency of administration of the compositions and the route of administration. The exact dosage is chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient to be treated.</p>

In general, the hly promoter and (selected) signal peptide sequence was inserted between the unique Kpn I and Bam HI sites in the pPL2 or pAM401-MCS plasmid vectors. Selected EphA2 genes (sometimes modified to contain N-terminal and C-terminal epitope tags; see description below) were cloned subsequently into these constructs between unique Bam HI and Sac I sites. Molecular constructs based on the pAM401-MCS plasmid vector were introduced by electroporation into selected <i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>strains also treated with lysozyme, utilizing methods common to those skilled in the art. The expected plasmid structure in <i>Listeria</i>-transfectants was verified by isolating DNA from colonies that formed on chloramphenicol-containing BHI agar plates (10 μg/ml) by restriction enzyme analysis. Recombinant <i>Listeria </i>transformed with various pAM401-MCS based heterologous protein expression cassette constructs were utilized to measure heterologous protein expression and secretion, as described below.</p>
    <p num="p-0433">The pPL2 based heterologous protein expression cassette constructs were incorporated into the tRNA<sup>Arg </sup>gene in the genome of selected <i>Listeria </i>strains, according to the methods as described previously [Lauer et. al., J. Bacteriol. 184, 4177-4186 (2002)]. Briefly, the pPL2 heterologous protein expression cassette constructs plasmid was first introduced into the <i>E. coli </i>host strain SM10 (Simon et. al., Bio/Technology 1:784-791 (1983)] by electroporation or by chemical means. Subsequently, the pPL2-based plasmid was transferred from transformed SM10 to the selected <i>Listeria </i>strains by conjugation. Following incubation on drug-selective BHI agar plates containing 7.5 μg of chloramphenicol per ml and 200 μg of streptomycin per ml as described, selected colonies are purified by passaging 3 times on plates with the same composition. To verify integration of the pPL2 vector at the phage attachment site, individual colonies are picked and screened by PCR using the primer pair of forward primer NC 16 (5′-gtcaaaacatacgctcttatc-3′ (SEQ ID NO:94)) and reverse primer PL95 (5′-acataatcagtccaaagtagatgc-3′ (SEQ ID NO:95)). Selected colonies having the pPL2-based plasmid incorporated into the TRNA<sup>Arg </sup>gene in the genome of selected <i>Listeria </i>strains yielded a diagnostic DNA amplicon of 499 bps.</p>

    <p num="p-0463">A secondary PCR reaction is then performed, using approximately 5 μl of each primary PCR reaction as template. The secondary PCR reaction uses the following primers: KpnI-LLO 1257F (primer used previously): 5′CTCTGGTACCTCCTTTGATTAGTATATTC (SEQ ID NO:74) and pCR-TOPO-2258R: 5′-CCCTTGGGGATCCTTAATTATACG (SEQ ID NO:83). The size of the resulting amplicon is 1715 bps. The expected amplicon sizes in all PCR reactions are verified by agarose gel analysis. The secondary PCR reaction is cleaned, digested with BamHI, cleaned again, and digested with KpnI. The hlyP-p60 gene fragment (KpnI-BamHI) (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>) is then ligated between the BamHI and KpnI sites of both pPL2 and modified pAM401 (pAM401-MCS; <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>) plasmids.</p>
    <p num="p-0464">The construction of pPL2-p60 plasmid is then confirmed with BamH/KpnI (1697, 6024 bps) and HindIII (210, 424, 3460, 3634 bps) digests. The PstI site in pPL2-p60 plasmid is also confirmed as unique. (Also, KpnI/PstI digest will yield fragments of 736 and 6985 bps.) The construction of the pAM401-p60 plasmid (KpnI/PstI, and KpnI/BamHI fragments from p60 region is the same as that for the pPL2 construct.</p>

    <p num="p-0466">The desired antigen-encoding sequences can then be inserted within the p60 sequence and in the same translational frame as the p60 sequence using techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Typically, the insertion or insertions should leave the N-terminal signal peptide sequence of p60 intact. The C-terminal autolysin sequence of p60 should also be left intact.</p>

    <p num="p-0470">Briefly, bacteria electroporated with the pKSV7-heterologous protein expression cassette plasmid are selected by plating on BHI agar media containing chloramphenicol (10 μg/ml), and incubated at the permissive temperature of 30° C. Single cross-over integration into the bacterial chromosome is selected by passaging several individual colonies for multiple generations at the non-permissive temperature of 41° C. in media containing chloramphenicol. Finally, plasmid excision and curing (double cross-over) is achieved by passaging several individual colonies for multiple generations at the permissive temperature of 30° C. in BHI media not containing chloramphenicol. Verification of integration of the heterologous protein expression cassette into the bacteria chromosome is verified by PCR, utilizing a primer pair that amplifies a region defined from within the heterologous protein expression cassette to the bacterial chromosome targeting sequence not contained in the pKSV7 plasmid vector construct.</p>

Briefly, mid-log phase cultures of <i>Listeria </i>grown in BHI media were collected in a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube, the bacteria were pelleted, and ice-cold TCA was added to a final [6%] concentration to the bacterial culture supernatant and incubated on ice minimally for 90 min or overnight. The TCA-precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation at 2400×g for 20 min at 4° C. The pellet was then resuspended in 300-600 μl volume of TE, pH 8.0 containing 15 μg/ml phenol red. Sample dissolution was facilitated by vortexing. Sample pH was adjusted by NH<sub>4</sub>OH addition if necessary until color was pink. All samples were prepared for electrophoresis by addition of 100 μl of 4×SDS loading buffer and incubating for 10 min. at 90° C. The samples were then centrifuged from 5 min at 14,000 rpm in a micro-centrifuge, and the supernatants collected and stored at −20° C. For Western bolt analysis, 20 μl of prepared fractions (the equivalent of culture fluids from of 1-4×10<sup>9 </sup>bacteria), were loaded on the 4-12% SDS-PAGE gel, electrophoresed, and the proteins were transferred to PDDF membrane, according to common methods used by those skilled in the art. Transferred membranes were prepared s for incubation with antibody, by incubating in 5% dry milk in PBS for 2 hr. at room temperature with agitation. Antibodies were used under the following dilutions in PBST buffer (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS): (1) Rabbit anti-Myc polyclonal antibody (ICL laboratories, Newberg, Oreg.) at 1:10,000; (2) murine anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.) at 1:2,000; and, (3) Rabbit anti-EphA2 (carboxy terminus-specific) polyclonal antibody (sc-924, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, Calif.). Specific binding of antibody to protein targets was evaluated by secondary incubation with goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and detection with the ECL chemilumenescence assay kit (Amersham), and exposure to film.</p>

    <p num="p-0495">Significantly, even though pCDNA4-EphA2 plasmid transfected 293 cells yielded very high levels of protein expression, immunization of Balb/C mice bearing CT26.24 (huEphA2+) lung tumors with the pCDNA4-EphA2 plasmid did not result in any observance of therapeutic anti-tumor efficacy (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>).</p>
    <p num="p-0496">For therapeutic in vivo tumor studies, female Balb/C mice were implanted IV with 5×10<sup>5 </sup>CT26 cells stably expressing EphA2. Three days later, mice were randomized and vaccinated IV with various recombinant <i>Listeria </i>strains encoding EphA2. In some cases (noted in figures) mice were vaccinated with 100 μg of pCDNA4 plasmid or pCDNA4-EphA2 plasmid in the tibialis anterior muscle. As a positive control, mice were vaccinated IV with recombinant <i>Listeria </i>strains encoding OVA.AHI or OVA.AH1-A5 protein chimeras. Mice were vaccinated on days 3 and 14 following tumor cell implantation. Mice injected with Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) buffer or unmodified <i>Listeria </i>served as negative controls. All experimental cohorts contained 5 mice. For survival studies mice were sacrificed when they started to show any signs of stress or labored breathing.</p>
    <heading>Example 21</heading> <heading>Assessment of Antigen-Specific Immune Responses After Vaccination</heading> <p num="p-0497">The vaccines of the present invention can be assessed using a variety of in vitro and in vivo methods. Some assays involve the analysis of antigen-specific T cells from the spleens of mice that have been vaccinated. Provided in this example are non-limiting examples of methods of assessing in vitro and in vivo immune responses. The antigens recited in these exemplary descriptions of assays are model antigens, not necessarily antigens produced using the recombinant nucleic acid molecules, expression cassettes, and/or expression vectors described herein. One of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that the assays described in this example can readily be applied for use in assessing the in vitro or in vivo immune responses of bacteria comprising the recombinant nucleic acid molecules, expression cassettes, and/or expression vectors described herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0498">For example C57Bl/6 or Balb/c are vaccinated by intravenous injection of 0.1 LD<sub>50 </sub>of a <i>Listeria </i>strain expressing OVA (or other appropriate antigen). Seven days after the vaccination, the spleen cells of the mice are harvested (typically 3 mice per group) by placing the spleens into ice cooled RPMI 1640 medium and preparing a single cell suspension from this. As an alternative, the lymph nodes of the mice could be similarly harvested, prepared as a single cell suspension and substituted for the spleen cells in the assays described below. Typically, spleen cells are assessed for intravenous or intraperitoneal administration of the vaccine while spleen cells and cells from lymph nodes are assessed for intramuscular, subcutaneous or intradermal administration of the vaccine.</p>
    <p num="p-0499">Unless otherwise noted, all antibodies used in these examples can be obtained from Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif.</p>
    <p num="p-0500">ELISPOT Assay: Using a <i>Listeria </i>strain having an OVA antigen as an example, the quantitative frequency of antigen-specific T cells generated upon immunization in a mouse model is assessed using an ELISPOT assay. The antigen-specific T cells evaluated are OVA specific CD8+ or LLO specific CD8+ or CD4+ T cells. This OVA antigen model assesses the immune response to a heterologous tumor antigen inserted into the vaccine and could be substituted with any antigen of interest. The LLO antigen is specific to <i>Listeria</i>. The specific T cells are assessed by detection of cytokine release (e.g. IFN-γ) upon recognition of the specific antigen. PVDF-based 96 well plates (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.) are coated overnight at 4° C. with an anti-murine IFN-γ monoclonal antibody (mAb R4; 5 μg/ml). The plates are washed and blocked for 2 hours at room temperature with 200 μL of complete RPMI. Spleen cells from vaccinated mice (or non vaccinated control mice) are added at 2×10<sup>5 </sup>cells per well and incubated for 20 to 22 hours at 37° C. in the presence of various concentrations of peptides ranging from 0.01 to 10 μM. The peptides used for OVA and LLO are either SL8, an MHC class I epitope for OVA, LLO<sub>190 </sub>(NEKYAQAYPNVS (SEQ ID NO: 100) Invitrogen) an MHC class II epitope for listeriolysin O (<i>Listeria </i>antigen), LLO<sub>296 </sub>(VAYGRQVYL (SEQ ID NO:101) an MHC class I epitope for listeriolysin O, or LLO<sub>91 </sub>(GYKDGNEYI (SEQ ID NO:102)), an MHC class I epitope for listeriolysin O. LLO<sub>190 </sub>and LLO<sub>296 </sub>are used in a C57Bl/6 model, while LLO<sub>91 </sub>is used in a Balb/c model. After washing, the plates are incubated with secondary biotinylated antibodies specific for IFN-γ (XMG1.2) diluted in PBS to 0.5 μg/ml. After incubation at room temperature for 2 hours, the plates are washed and incubated for 1 hour at 37° C. with a 1 nm gold goat anti-biotin conjugate (GAB-1; 1:200 dilution; Ted Pella, Redding, Calif.) diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA. After thorough washing, the plates are incubated at room temperature for 2 to 10 minutes with substrate (Silver Enhancing Kit; 30 ml/well; Ted Pella) for spot development. The plates are then rinsed with distilled water to stop the substrate reaction. After the plates have been air-dried, spots in each well are counted using an automated ELISPOT plate reader (CTL, Cleveland, Ohio). The cytokine response is expressed as the number of IFN-γ spot-forming cells (SFCs) per 2×10<sup>5 </sup>spleen cells for either the OVA specific T cells or the <i>Listeria </i>specific T cells.</p>
    <p num="p-0501">Intracellular Cytokine Staining Assay (ICS): In order to further assess the number of antigen-specific CD8+ or CD4+ T cells and correlate the results with those obtained from ELISPOT assays, ICS is performed and the cells evaluated by flow cytometry analysis. Spleen cells from vaccinated and control groups of mice are incubated with SL8 (stimulates OVA specific CD8+ cells) or LLO<sub>190 </sub>(stimulates LLO specific CD4+ cells) for 5 hours in the presence of Brefeldin A (Pharmingen). The Brefeldin A inhibits secretion of the cytokines produced upon stimulation of the T cells. Spleen cells incubated with an irrelevant MHC class I peptide are used as controls. PMA (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, Sigma) 20 ng/ml and ionomycin (Sigma) 2 μg/ml stimulated spleen cells are used as a positive control for IFN-γ and TNF-α intracellular cytokine staining. For detection of cytoplasmic cytokine expression, cells are stained with FITC-anti-CD4 mAb (RM 4-5) and PerCP-anti-CD8 mAb (53-6.7), fixed and permeabilized with Cytofix/CytoPerm solution (Pharmingen), and stained with PE-conjugated anti-TNF-α mAb (MP6-XT22) and APC-conjugated anti-IFN-γ mAb (XMG1.2) for 30 minutes on ice. The percentage of cells expressing intracellular IFN-γ and/or TNF-α was determined by flow cytometry (FACScalibur, Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, Calif.) and data analyzed using CELLQuest software (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry System). As the fluorescent labels on the various antibodies can all be distinguished by the FACScalibur, the appropriate cells are identified by gating for those CD8+ and CD4+ that are stained with either or both of the anti-IFN-γ or anti-TNF-α.</p>
    <p num="p-0502"> <i>Cytokine Expression of Stimulated Spleen Cells</i>: The level of cytokine secretion by the spleen cells of mice can also be assessed for control and vaccinated C57B1/6 mice. Spleen cells are stimulated for 24 hours with SL8 or LLO<sub>190</sub>. Stimulation with irrelevant peptide HSV-gB2 (Invitrogen, SSIEFARL, SEQ ID NO:124) is used as a control. The supernatants of the stimulated cells are collected and the levels of T helper-1 and T helper 2 cytokines are determined using an ELISA assay (eBiosciences, CO) or a Cytometric Bead Array Kit (Pharmingen).</p>
    <p num="p-0503">Assessment of Cytotoxic T cell Activity: The OVA specific CD8+ T cells can be further evaluated by assessing their cytotoxic activity, either in vitro or directly in C57Bl/6 mouse in vivo. The CD8+ T cells recognize and lyse their respective target cells in an antigen-specific manner. In vitro cytotoxicity is determined using a chromium release assay. Spleen cells of naïve and <i>Listeria</i>-OVA (internal) vaccinated mice are stimulated at a 10:1 ratio with either irradiated EG7.OVA cells (EL-4 tumor cell line transfected to express OVA, ATCC, Manassas, Va.) or with 100 nM SL8, in order to expand the OVA specific T cells in the spleen cell population. After 7 days of culture, the cytotoxic activity of the effector cells is determined in a standard 4-hour 51Cr-release assay using EG7.OVA or SL8 pulsed EL-4 cells (ATCC, Manassas, Va.) as target cells and EL-4 cells alone as negative control. The YAC-1 cell line (ATCC, Manassas, Va.) is used as targets to determine NK cell activity, in order to distinguish the activity due to T cells from that due to NK cells. The percentage of specific cytotoxicity is calculated as 100× (experimental release−spontaneous release)/(maximal release−spontaneous release). Spontaneous release is determined by incubation of target cells without effector cells. Maximal release is determined by lysing cells with 0.1% Triton X-100. Experiments are considered valid for analysis if spontaneous release is &lt;20% of maximal release.</p>
    <p num="p-0504">For the assessment of cytotoxic activity of OVA-specific CD8+ T cells in vivo, spleen cells from naïve C57Bl/6 mice are split into two equivalent aliquots. Each group is pulsed with a specific peptide, either target (SL8) or control (HSV-gB2), at 0.5 μg/ml for 90 minutes at 37° C. Cells are then washed 3 times in medium, and twice in PBS+0.1% BSA. Cells are resuspended at 1×10<sup>7 </sup>per ml in warm PBS+0.1% BSA (10 ml or less) for labeling with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE, Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.). To the target cell suspension, 1.25 μL of a 5 mM stock of CFSE is added and the sample mixed by vortexing. To the control cell suspension, a ten-fold dilution of the CFSE stock is added and the sample mixed by vortexing. The cells are incubated at 37° C. for 10 minutes. Staining is stopped by addition of a large volume (&gt;40 ml) of ice-cold PBS. The cells are washed twice at room temperature with PBS, then resuspended and counted. Each cell suspension is diluted to 50×10<sup>6 </sup>per ml, and 100 μL of each population is mixed and injected via the tail vein of either naïve or vaccinated mice. After 12-24 hours, the spleens are harvested and a total of 5×10<sup>6 </sup>cells are analyzed by flow cytometry. The high (target) and low (control) fluorescent peaks are enumerated, and the ratio of the two is used to establish the percentage of target cell lysis. The in vivo cytotoxicity assay permits the assessment of lytic activity of antigen-specific T cells without the need of in vitro re-stimulation. Furthermore, this assays assesses the T cell function in their native environment.</p>

(The intracellular domain of hEphA2 is alternatively referred to herein as hEphA2-ICD, hEphA2 ICD, EphA2 CO, or CO. The extracellular domain of hEphA2 is alternatively referred to herein as hEphA2-ECD, hEphA2 ECD, EphA2 EX2, or EX2.) Mice were euthanized, and spleens harvested and pooled 6 days after the last immunization. For the ELISPOT assay, the cells were re-stimulated in vitro with P815 cells expressing full-length hEphA2 or cell lysates prepared from these cells. The parental P815 cells or cell lysates served as a negative control. Cells were also stimulated with recombinant hEphA2 Fc fusion protein. IFN-gamma positive spot forming colonies (SFCs) were measured using a 96 well spot reader. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>, increased IFN-gamma SFCs were observed with spleen cells derived from mice vaccinated with <i>Listeria</i>-hEphA2. Both hEphA2 expressing cells or cell lysates stimulation resulted in an increase in IFN-gamma SFC which suggests an EphA2-specific CD8+ as well as CD4+ T cell response. Spleen cells from mice vaccinated with the parental <i>Listeria </i>control did not demonstrate an increase in IFN-gamma SFC.</p>

    <p num="p-0524">A secondary PCR reaction is performed, utilizing approximately equal amounts of each primary reaction as template (ca. 5 μl). The expected size of the <i>Listeria </i>amplicon from the secondary PCR reaction is verified by 1% agarose gel (2033 bps). Adenosine residue are added at the 3′ ends of <i>Listeria </i>dl inlB amplicon with Taq polymerase.</p>
    <p num="p-0525">The <i>Listeria </i>dl inlB amplicon is then inserted into a pCR2.1-TOPO vector. The pCR2.1-TOPO-dl inlB plasmid DNA is digested with XhoI and KpnI and the 2123 bp fragment is gel purified. The KpnI/XhoI 2123 bp fragment is inserted into a pKSV7 vector that has been prepared by digestion with KpnI and XhoI and treatment with CIAP (pKSV7-dl inlB). The fidelity of dl inlB sequence in pKSV7-dl inlB is then verified. The inlB gene is deleted from desired <i>Listeria </i>strains by allelic exchange with pKSV7-dl inlB plasmid.</p>

    <heading>Example 27</heading> <heading>Expression and Secretion of Antigens from Recombinant <i>Listeria </i>Comprising Codon-Optimized Expression Cassettes</heading> <p num="p-0531">Codon optimization of both signal peptide and tumor antigen provides efficient expression and secretion from recombinant <i>Listeria</i>: Codon-optimization of both signal peptide- and heterologous protein-encoding genetic elements provides optimal secretion from recombinant <i>Listeria</i>-based vaccines of human tumor antigens that contain hydrophobic domains. Efficient antigen secretion from cytosolic bacteria is required for efficient presentation via the MHC class I pathway and CD8+ T-cell priming, and is thus linked directly to the potency of <i>Listeria</i>-based vaccines. Secretion from recombinant <i>Listeria </i>of two malignant cell membrane-bound human tumor antigens, mesothelin and NY-ESO-1, which are immune targets related to pancreatic and ovarian cancer (mesothelin), and melanoma (NY-ESO-1), among other solid tumors, has been optimized through codon-optimization of the combination of both the antigen and signal peptide coding sequences.</p>
    <p num="p-0532">A variety of expression, cassettes were constructed comprising the hly promoter linked to either native or codon-optimized sequences encoding signal peptides related to secA1 or alternative secretion pathways including secA2 and Twin-Arg Translocation (Tat), fused in frame with a selected human tumor antigen—human NY-ESO-1 or human mesothelin. (See Examples 11-14 and 25, above, for the antigen sequences and/or signal sequences.) Western blot analysis of TCA-precipitated culture fluids of <i>Listeria </i>grown in BHI broth was used to assess the synthesis and secretion of the heterologous proteins from the recombinant <i>Listeria</i>. (Methods analogous to those described in Example 18, above, were used for the Western blot analyses.)</p>
    <p num="p-0533">The results of these experiments are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48A-C</figref>. Efficient expression and secretion of full-length tumor antigens from recombinant <i>Listeria </i>was observed when both signal peptide coding sequences, including when derived from <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>, and operably linked foreign antigen coding sequences were optimized for codon usage in <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48A</figref> shows the expression/secretion of human mesothelin by ΔactA <i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>with a construct comprising an LLO signal peptide fused with human mesothelin, using native codons for both LLO and mesothelin. By Western analysis of TCA-precipitated bacterial culture fluids, secretion of expected full-length mesothelin (62 kDa) was not observed with these constructs, and only secretion of several small fragments was observed (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48A</figref>).</p>
    <p num="p-0534"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48B</figref> shows a Western blot analysis of the expression/secretion of human mesothelin by <i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>ΔactA comprising plasmids (pAM401) containing constructs encoding various signal peptides fused with human mesothelin. In each construct, the mesothelin coding sequence was codon-optimized for expression in <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>. Where indicated, the signal peptide coding sequences used contained either the native sequence (“native”) or were codon-optimized (“CodOp”) for expression in <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>. Secreted mesothelin was detected using an affinity-purified polyclonal anti-human/mouse antibody, prepared by injection of rabbits with selected peptides together with IFA.</p>
    <p num="p-0535">Significantly, as shown in lanes 3-5, and 8-9 of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48B</figref>, secretion of full-length mesothelin (62 kDa) was observed only when both signal peptide and mesothelin coding sequences were codon-optimized for expression in <i>Listeria</i>. This observation significantly also included the <i>Listeria</i>-derived signal peptides from the bacterial LLO and p60 proteins, related to the secA1 and secA2 secretion pathways, respectively, both of which contain infrequently-used codons. (The LLO PEST sequence is also included with the LLO signal peptide and its coding sequence is also codon-optimized.) Efficient secretion of full-length mesothelin (62 kDa) was observed when the codon-optimized <i>Listeria </i>LLO signal peptide was linked with codon-optimized mesothelin (Lane 8, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48B</figref>), but NOT when the native coding sequence of the <i>Listeria </i>LLO signal peptide was used (Lane 7, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48B</figref>). Furthermore, secretion of full-length mesothelin (62 kDa) was observed when the codon-optimized Listeria p60 signal peptide was linked with codon-optimized mesothelin (Lane 3, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48B</figref>), but NOT when the native coding sequence of the <i>Listeria </i>p60 signal peptide was used (Lane 6, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48B</figref>). Finally, secretion of full-length mesothelin (62 kDa) was observed when codon-optimized optimized signal peptides from bacterial species different from <i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>were operably linked to codon-optimized mesothelin (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48B</figref>). The signal peptide from <i>Bacillus anthracis </i>protective antigen (Ba PA), or the signal peptide from <i>Lactococcus lactis </i>Usp45 protein (Ll Usp45) programmed the efficient secretion of full-length mesothelin (62 kDa) from the recombinant <i>Listeria </i>strains (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48B</figref>, lanes 4 and 5). The <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>phoD signal peptide (Bs phoD) also programmed the efficient secretion of full-length mesothelin from <i>Listeria </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48B</figref>, lane 9). The bands with a molecular weight of about 62,000 correspond to mesothelin and the pairs of double bands probably correspond to non-cleaved plus cleaved mesothelin polypeptides (i.e., to partial cleavage).</p>
    <p num="p-0536"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48C</figref> shows the expression/secretion of NY-ESO-1 from <i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>ΔactAΔinlB with constructs comprising a sequence encoding LLO signal peptide which was fused with a sequence encoding human NY-ESO-1, both of which were codon-optimized for expression in <i>Listeria</i>. Secreted NY-ESO-1 was detected using a NY-ESO-1 monoclonal antibody.</p>
    <p num="p-0537">In this example, signal peptide and tumor antigen domains were synthesized to utilize the most preferred codon for each amino acid, as defined by frequency of occurrence per 1000 codons in coding sequences from the <i>Listeria </i>genome (Table 2A). Signal peptides related to secA1, secA2, or twin-Arg translocation (Tat) secretion pathways from <i>Listeria </i>and other Gram-positive bacterial genera programmed the efficient secretion of human tumor antigens from recombinant <i>Listeria</i>. Surprisingly, the signal peptides from <i>Listeria </i>proteins LLO and p60 each contain rare codons (frequency of &lt;10 per 1000 codons), and optimization of these sequences was required for efficient secretion of mesothelin and NY-ESO-1 from recombinant <i>Listeria </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48B</figref>). Mesothelin secretion was also observed when linked to secA1 signal peptides from <i>B. anthracis </i>protective antigen (pagA) and <i>Lactococcus lactis </i>Usp45, and the Tat signal peptide from the phosphodiesterase/alkaline phosphatase D gene (PhoD) of <i>B. subtilis. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0538">Signal peptides from distinct secretion pathways were used to determine whether a particular pathway would be favored for optimal secretion of heterologous proteins. For example, the Tat pathway is utilized for secretion of proteins folded within the bacterium, and the <i>B. subtilis </i>phoD protein is secreted via this mechanism. It had originally been hypothesized that secretion of tumor antigens containing significant hydrophobic domains, such as NY-ESO-1, might be facilitated by folding prior to transport. However, these results indicated that codon-optimization of both the signal peptide and tumor antigen encoding sequences, and not secretion pathway, is the primary requirement for efficient secretion of mammalian proteins.</p>
    <p num="p-0539">Importantly, the phenotype of recombinant vaccines utilizing any pathway for tumor antigen secretion was not significantly affected, as compared to the parental <i>Listeria </i>ΔactA/ΔinlB strain. The median lethality (LD<sub>50</sub>) of <i>Listeria </i>ΔactA/ΔinlB is 1×10<sup>8 </sup>cfu in C57BL/6 mice. Stable single copy site-specific incorporation of tumor antigen expression cassettes into an innocuous site on the chromosome of <i>Listeria </i>ΔactA/ΔinlB, was accomplished using the pPL2 integration vector. The LD<sub>50 </sub>of tumor antigen encoding <i>Listeria </i>ΔactA/ΔinlB was within 5-fold of <i>Listeria </i>ΔactA/ΔinlB.</p>

Secretion of the EX2 and CO domains is accomplished by functional linkage of the Ba PA and Bs PhoD signal peptides with the EX2 and CO domains, respectively.</p>
    <p num="p-0541">A codon-optimized human EphA2 kinase dead plasmid, known as phEphA2KD, is used in the construction of a bicistronic hEphA2 expression vector. (EphA2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase, but the kinase activity is ablated by a mutation from K to M at the active site of the enzyme.) The coding sequences of phEphA2KD are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>. The phEphA2KD sequence in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref> comprises the codon-optimized coding sequence for hEphA2 deleted of the transmembrane domain, and contains unique 5′ and 3′ Bam HI and Sac I restriction sites to facilitate construction of functional antigen expression cassettes.

    <p num="p-0542">A sub-fragment of the human EphA2 (trans-membrane domain deleted, kinase-dead) between the two Mlu I restriction enzyme recognition sequences is synthesized (by a gene synthesis method known in the art, e.g., by oligonucleotide synthesis, PCR, and/or Klenow fill-in, or the like). The actA-plcB intergenic region is inserted during the synthesis precisely at the junction between the EphA2 extracellular and intracellular domains, which are separated by the hydrophobic trans-membrane domain in the native protein. The sequence of the Mlu I sub-fragment of codon-optimized human EphA2 containing the actA-plcB intergenic region is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref> (the intergenic region is shown in bold). Additionally, the codon-optimized Bs phoD signal peptide is placed at the 3′ end of the actA-plcB intergenic sequence and is fused in-frame with the downstream EphA2 CO domain coding region.</p>
    <p num="p-0543">The functional human EphA2 bicistronic cassette is assembled by substitution of the Mlu I fragment containing the actA-plcB intergenic region and Bs phoD signal peptide for the corresponding region in the trans-membrane deleted kinase dead human EphA2 sequence shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>. This resulting sequence contains unique Bam HI and Sac I restriction enzyme recognition sites at its 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, to facilitate insertion and functional linkage to the hly promoter and initial signal peptide, for example Ba PA.</p>
    <p num="p-0544">Thus, the seven ordered functional elements of the bicistronic human EphA2 antigen expression cassette are the following: hly promoter-Ba PA signal peptide-EX domain EphA2-termination codon-actA-plcB intergenic region (with Shine-Dalgarno sequence)-Bs PhoD signal peptide-CO domain EphA2-termination codon. All EphA2 and signal peptide coding sequences are preferably codon-optimized.</p>

    <heading>Example 29</heading> <heading>Expression and Secretion of Antigens from Recombinant <i>Listeria </i>Comprising Antigen-Bacterial Protein Chimeras</heading> <p num="p-0546">In some embodiments of the invention, both the sequences encoding the signal peptide and its heterologous protein fusion partner are codon-optimized. In some embodiments, it is desirable to place the codon-optimized heterologous protein sequence within a defined region of a protein, whose native form is secreted from <i>Listeria</i>. The heterologous protein sequence is functionally placed within a defined sequence of the selected secreted <i>Listeria </i>protein sequence such that a protein chimera is synthesized and secreted that corresponds to the combined molecular weights of the secreted proteins. Secretion of the heterologous protein can be facilitated by exploiting the machinery of the host <i>Listeria </i>bacterium that is required for optimal secretion of autologous bacterial proteins. Molecular chaperones facilitate secretion of selected bacterial proteins.</p>
    <p num="p-0547">As a non-limiting example, protein chimeras between the <i>L. monocytogene </i>protein p60 and the human tumor antigen, mesothelin, were generated. The protein chimeras were generated by precise placement of the human tumor antigen, mesothelin, into <i>L. monocytogenes </i>protein p60 at amino acid position 70 (although it is understood that any desired heterologous protein encoding sequence can be selected to generate a protein chimera). The protein chimera contained optimal codons for expression in <i>Listeria </i>in the p60 amino acids 1-70 and the entire mesothelin coding sequence. Furthermore, the p60-human mesothelin protein chimeria was functionally linked to the <i>L. monocytogenes </i>hly promoter, incorporated into the pPL2 vector, which was used subsequently as described herein to generate recombinant <i>L. monocytogenes </i>strains expressing and secreting human mesothelin. The experimental methods used to construct a recombinant <i>Listeria </i>strain that optimally expresses and secretes a p60-human mesothelin protein chimera are described below.</p>
    <p num="p-0548">In some embodiments, an important feature of protein chimeras between a selected <i>L. monocytogenes </i>gene and a selected heterologous protein sequence is appropriate functional placement of the selected heterologous protein sequence within the selected <i>L. monocytogenes </i>gene to retain optimal secretion of the protein chimera through interaction of the <i>L. monocytogenes </i>expressed protein with the bacterial chaperones and secretion apparatus, as well as to retain functional activity of the <i>L. monocytogenes </i>protein in the context of the protein chimera. In some embodiments, functional placement of a heterologous sequence within the <i>L. monocytogenes </i>secA2-dependent proteins NamA and p60 is desired to retain the peptidoglycan cell wall hydrolase activites of these said proteins. (See Lenz et. al. (2003 PNAS, 100:12432-12437), for instance, for descriptions of the SecA2-dependent NamA and p60 proteins.) In some embodiments, the functional placement of the heterologous protein coding sequence is desired between the signal sequence (SS) and the cell wall binding domains (LySM) and catalytic domains Lyz-2 (NamA) and p60-dom (p60) (Lenz et. al. (2003)).</p>
    <p num="p-0549">In some embodiments, expression of antigens or heterologous proteins is functionally linked to a prfA-dependent promoter. As such, expression of the heterologous protein is induced within the microenvironment of the recombinant <i>Listeria </i>infected cell.</p>
    <p num="p-0550">The first step in the construction of a p60-Mesothelin protein chimera involved the DNA synthesis of the prfA-dependent hly promoter linked functionally to a DNA sequence encoding the first 70 amino acids of p60, with codons for optimal secretion in <i>Listeria</i>. (In some embodiments, the codon usage can be modified further to avoid regions of excessive RNA secondary structure, which may inhibit protein translation efficiency.) The DNA sub-fragment corresponding to the hly promoter-70 N-terminal p60 amino acids was synthesized. (This can generally be done by a gene synthesis method known in the art, e.g., by oligonucleotide synthesis, PCR, and/or Klenow fill-in, or the like.)</p>

The results demonstrate that the highest expression and secretion was found where the signal sequence comprised <i>B. anthracis </i>Protective Antigen signal sequence (lanes 1-2) and <i>B. subtilis </i>phoD signal sequence (lanes 5-6).</p>

Expression and secretion of human mesothelin was tested when fused to a non-Listerial secA1 and non-secA1 signal peptides. The <i>Listeria </i>bacteria tested were all ΔactA/ΔinlB <i>Listeria </i>and were as follows: <i>Listeria </i>ΔactA/ΔinlB (control <i>Listeria </i>that was not engineered to express mesothelin) (Lane 1); <i>Listeria </i>encoding <i>B. anthracis </i>Protective Antigen signal sequence fused to ΔSS/ΔGPI hMesothelin (Lanes 2-3); Listeria encoding <i>B. subtilis </i>phoD signal sequence fused to ΔSS/ΔGPI hMesothelin (Lanes 4-5); Listeria encoding <i>B. anthracis </i>Protective Antigen signal sequence fused with full-length hMesothelin (Lanes 6-7); <i>Listeria </i>encoding <i>B. subtilis </i>phoD signal sequence fused to full-length hMesothelin (Lanes 8-9).</p>

    <p num="h-0103">A. Immunogenicity of <i>Listeria </i>Vaccine Comprising P-60-Model Antigen Chimera</p>
    <p num="p-0577"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 59A</figref> and B show delivery of a heterologous antigen to the MHC Class I pathway by <i>Listeria </i>expressing either a p60-antigen chimera or an LLO signal peptide-antigen fusion protein. The heterologous antigen used in this experiment was AH1-A5. Vaccination was with <i>Listeria </i>engineered to comprise a p60 protein chimera expression cassette encoding AH1-A5 (fused to the OVA SL8 peptide) inserted within the p60 polypeptide sequence including the N-terminal p60 signal peptide sequence (“p60-based construct”), or <i>Listeria </i>engineered to encode an LLO signal peptide linked to a nucleic acid encoding the same antigen, AH1-A5 embedded within OVA (“LLO-based construct”). Both of these constructs used the Listerial promoter hly. p60 is a Listerial peptidoglycan autolysin that is secreted by a secA2 pathway, while LLO is listeriolysin.</p>
    <p num="p-0578">To generate the p60-based construct, the nucleic acid encoding p60 was engineered to contain a PstI cloning site, where the PstI cloning site represented a silent mutation, i.e., resulting in no change in the encoded amino acid sequence. The PstI site was located between the N-terminal signal sequence and the first of two LysM cell wall binding domains in the p60 sequence. A polynucleotide encoding a heterologous polypeptide comprising the AH1-A5 epitope (SPSYAYHQF (SEQ ID NO:73)) and SL8 epitope (SIINFEKL (SEQ ID NO:123)) was inserted in frame into the PstI cloning site. The coding sequences for these epitopes were separated by a unique XhoI site and codon-optimized for expression in <i>L. monocytogenes</i>. The insertion into the PstI site occurred at the equivalent of nucleotide base number 199 of p60. The first 1-70 amino acids of the p60 coding sequence were codon-optimized for expression in <i>L. monocytogenes</i>. Accordingly, the first 27 amino acids corresponding to the signal peptide were expressed from optimal codons for expression in <i>L. monocytogenes</i>. The antigen expression cassette further contained unique 5′ and 3′ KpnI and Sacd sites, respectively for insertion into the MCS of the pPL2 plasmid, for site-specific integration adjacent to the tRNA<sup>Arg </sup>gene of the <i>L. monocytogenes </i>genome. The LLO-based construct comprised a sequence encoding an LLO signal sequence operably linked to a nucleic acid encoding AH1-A5 within OVA (without use of any codon-optimization). Thus, in the present study, the signal peptide was either from <i>Listeria </i>LLO or from <i>Listeria </i>p60.</p>
    <p num="p-0579">The constructs were placed into pPL2, a vector that mediates site-specific recombination with <i>Listeria </i>genome, and inserted into the <i>Listeria </i>genome.</p>

In the x-axis of the figure, “Unstim” means that no peptide was added to the wells (i.e., the cells were unstimulated), while “AH1” means that the AH1 nonapeptide was added to the wells, and “AH1-A5” means that the AH1-A5 nonapeptide was added to the wells. All bacterial vaccines were engineered to contain an integrated nucleic acid encoding AH1-A5 (the bacterial vaccines did not encode AH1) (see, e.g., Slansky, et al. (2000) Immunity. 13:529-538). Where the vaccination was done with the <i>Listeria </i>comprising the p60-based constructs, the strain is indicated on the x-axis of the figure as “p60.” Where the vaccination was done with <i>Listeria </i>comprising the LLO-based constructs, the strain is indicated on the x-axis of the figure as “LLO.”</p>
    <p num="p-0581">The overall protocol for vaccination with <i>Listeria </i>expressing the P60-based construct was as follows: (1) Mice were vaccinated with <i>Listeria </i>(tail vein (i.v.)) containing an integrated nucleic acid, where the integrated nucleic acid encoded p60 containing a nucleic acid encoding AH1-A5 inserted at nucleotide 199 of p60. In other words, the nucleic acid encoding AH1-A5 antigen was in frame with and operably linked with p60 signal sequence and with p60 autolysin. The nucleic acid encoding AH1-A5 was codon optimized for expression in <i>L. monocytogenes</i>; (2) Seven days post infection, the spleens were removed; (3) Spleen cells were dissociated, placed in wells, and the spleen cells were incubated with either no added peptide (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 59A and 59B</figref>), with added AH1 (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59A</figref>), or with added AH1-A5 (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59B</figref>), as indicated on the x-axis; (4) After adding the peptide, cells were incubated for five hours, followed by assessment of the percent of IFNgamma expressing CD8+ T cells by FACS analysis. An analogous protocol was used for vaccination with <i>Listeria </i>expressing the LLO-based construct.</p>
    <p num="p-0582">The results demonstrate that the <i>Listeria </i>vaccines stimulated CD8+ T cell expression of IFNgamma, where the added peptide was AH1 (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59A</figref>) or where the added peptide was AH1-A5 (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59B</figref>). Stimulation was somewhat higher where integrated AH1-A5 was operably linked with LLO signal sequence, and stimulation was somewhat lower when integrated AH1-A5 was operably linked with p60 signal sequence (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 59A</figref> and B).</p>

    <p num="p-0585">The results depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref> reveal that vaccination with <i>Listeria </i>expressing human mesothelin (huMesothelin) prolongs survival in tumor-bearing mice, where the tumor cells in the mice had been engineered to express human mesothelin. The tumor cells were CT26 cells expressing human mesothelin and the mice were Balb/c mice. (All CT26 tumor studies described herein involved Balb/c mice.) In one of the expression cassettes, a sequence encoding a non-Listerial signal sequence was operably linked in frame with a codon-optimized sequence encoding human mesothelin (deleted of its signal sequence and GPI anchor). The expression cassette encoding a signal peptide fused with human mesothelin (ΔGPIΔSS) was administered to tumor-bearing mice in a <i>Listeria </i>vaccine in studies on the effect of the fusion protein on immune response to tumors. The expression cassette encoding the mesothelin fusion protein had been integrated into the <i>Listeria </i>chromosome. On Day 0, 2×10<sup>5 </sup>CT26 cells expressing human mesothelin (CT.26 huMeso+) were injected intravenously into the Balb/c mice. Vaccination of the mice was in the tail vein (i.v.). Inoculation with 1e7 colony forming units (CFU) <i>Listeria </i>(i.v.) occurred at day 3.</p>

The nucleic acid molecule encoding SF-AH1A5 and the nucleic acid molecule encoding the BaPA-huMeso ΔgpiΔss construct had been integrated into the <i>Listeria </i>genome using pPL2. SF is shorthand for an eight amino acid peptide derived from ovalbumin, also known as SL8 (see, e.g., Shastri and Ganzalez (1993) J. Immunol. 150:2724-2736). The abbreviations “SF-AH1A5,” “SF-AH1-A5,” and “OVA/AH1-A5” refer to AH1-A5 connected to an ovalbumin scaffold. “SF AH1-A5” refers to the AH1-A5 (SPSYAYHQF (SEQ ID NO:73)) and the SF peptide fused to the N-terminus of amino acids 138 to 386 of GenBank Accession. No. P01012 (ovalbumin). The polynucleotides encoding “SF-AH1A5,” in this example, comprised a codon-optimized nucleic acid encoding AH1-A5 and a non-codon optimized nucleic acid encoding the ovalbumin-derived sequence.</p>
    <p num="p-0587">The results demonstrate that a single immunization with <i>Listeria </i>expressing huMesothelin prolongs survival of mice containing huMesothelin-expressing tumors.
