    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>1.Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>The present invention relates to single stage electronic energy converter operated from an alternating power line, and capable of supplying, at the output, a load such as gas discharge lamp.</p>
    <p>2. Description of Prior Art</p>
    <p>The electronic energy converters, or as sometimes called "switching power supplies" need to operate directly from the alternating power line. Electric utility companies are setting requirements for specific groups of electricity-powered appliances in regards to power quality drawn by these appliances.</p>
    <p>The electronic ballast, as one of the appliances, is used in large quantities in lighting fixtures. In general, to meet the industry requirements in regards to power quality, an electronic ballast has to meet two fundamental requirements: (i) draw power from the power line with a power factor (PF) of at least 0.9, (ii) draw current from the power line with a total harmonic distortion (THD) of less than 20 percent.</p>
    <p>The electronic ballast has to meet other requirements related to compatability with a lamp-load. The electronic ballast shall provide lamp current crest factor of less than 1.7, where the "crest factor" is equal to a peak magnitude of the lamp current divided by its effective (RMS) value. This can be, in many situations, related to maximum allowable modulation of the lamp current magnitude, which is responsible for light flicker. It is desirable to have a constant power delivered to the lamp-load over the entire cycle of the voltage supplied by the power line.</p>
    <p>In order to convert the low frequency alternating voltage of a conventional power line (120 Volts/60 Hz or 220 Volts/50 Hz) to a high frequency (typically from 10 to 100 kHz) alternating voltage or current source, one has to rectify the signal from the power line, to a DC voltage which later is converted, by switching transistors, to the high frequency source.</p>
    <p>Conventional off-line rectifiers have a capacitive smoothing filter located beyond a diode rectifier circuit. This smoothing capacitor causes harmonic distortion of the current waveform during periods in which the rectified output is higher than the voltage over the smoothing capacitor, and during which time the capacitor charges up. This charging time, or conduction angle, is very small if large capacitor is used, and all the required charge has to be loaded into the capacitor in a short period of time. This results in a large current output from the rectified supply during the short conduction angle, and causes the current spikes in the rectified supply. These current spikes increase the harmonic content of the power supply, and when a number of ballasts are being used, this increased harmonic distortion causes a poor power factor in the supply. This situation is not accepted upon by electricity supply authorities, and it causes interference with other electrical equipment.</p>
    <p>Techniques for improving power factor include passive waveform shaping methods. One of them is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,150,013 issued to Bobel. This method requires an inductor to operate in a resonant mode with a capacitor, and the resonant frequency is approximately 180 Hz when power line frequency is 60 Hz. This method is very inexpensive and reliable. However, the inductor must be large in size.</p>
    <p>It is also known to use a storage conversion principle, whereby an inductor is controlled at high frequency in order to allow charging of the smoothing capacitor over a wide conduction angle. The system however requires a control circuit for the storage converter, known also as "boost converter", in order to regulate the discharge of energy from the storage inductor. Such a use of the storage conversion principle requires additional noise filtering because of large amount of noise is being generated by switching devices. The circuit is very complex and expensive to produce. Furthermore, the second stage converter is necessary to convert the DC voltage source to the high frequency alternating voltage or current source. This type of circuit is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,049,790 issued to Herfurth. It is also known to use a single stage converter which draws near sinusoidal current from the sinusoidal power line source, and delivers high frequency current to the lamp-load. In this principle, which uses resonant oscillatory circuit having ability to store and release energy, portion of the resonant energy is re-directed from the output to the input of the converter. This method creates large circulating currents within the oscillatory circuits, thus causes large amount of power being dissipated within the converter. The following patents describe single stage inverters which have portion of the energy from the output redirected to the input of the converter, and exibit large amount of power dissapation.:</p>

    <p>A boosting and rectifying voltage doubler BRVD of FIG. 12, may be substituted for the boosting and rectifying bridge BRB1 of FIG.1. The diodes D2 and D4 of FIG.1 are omitted in this version which is another alternative of the emodiments of the present invention.</p>
    <p>In FIG. 1, the alternating voltage source AVS represents an ordinary electric utility power line (120 Volts/60 Hz) which is connected through the inductor BI with the rectifier bridge of the boosting and rectifying bridge BRB. When the rectified voltage is present between terminals V+ and V-, the energy-storage capacitor SC is charged instantly, and high charging current will be flowing through diodes of the rectifier bridge. The boosting inductor BI, in conjunction with the boosting capacitors, forming a high frequency noise filter which is necessary for reduction of noise level, as required by the government regulations.</p>
    <p>The device starts its oscillations by triggering provided with a commonly known diac circuit (not shown) or can be initiated simply by momentarily connecting of a capacitor between the V+ terminal and the base of transistor Q2. For better understanding of the operation of the device, let assume that the alternating voltage, as per FIG. 13 (a), is at the beginning of the positive half-cycle when the transistor Q2 is switched into its conduction state. When the transistor Q2 is in the conduction state, the resonant oscillator RO1 is effectively connected between terminals V+ and V-. The resonant oscillator RO1 draws a pulsating current from these terminals, and the current is also circulated through the diodes of the boosting and rectifying bridge BRB. Diodes D2 and D3 of the bridge BRB are conducting current to supply energy to the energy-storage capacitor SC, and to the resonant oscillator RO1, and to the lamp load FL1, and to charge the boosting inductor and boosting capacitors connected across diodes D1 and D4. Diodes D1 and D4 of the bridge BRB are not conducting continous current supplied by the power line when the voltage of that line is positive. Therefore, the capacitors connected across diodes D1,D4 are charged up to that voltage magnitude which is present at that time. The pulsating current ends its pulse after a predetermined time period associated with the frequency of the resonant oscillator RO1. Then, the transistor Q1 is switched into its conduction state, and transistor Q2 is switched into its open state. The energy stored in the boosting inductor and boosting capacitors is naturally released and provided as auxiliary voltage, having an instantaneous magnitude higher than the rectified voltage provided by power line at the time. As a result, a variable DC voltage is developed between terminals V+, V-, as per FIG.13(b). The energy-storage capacitor SC is instantly charged-up to a voltage magnitude which is a result of a natural integration. The frequency of oscillation of the resonant oscillator is approximately 35 kHz. Therefore, during the positive half-cycle of the voltage supplied by the power line, the diodes D2 an D3 will be conducting pulsed current 291 times.</p>
    <p>When the power line voltage is near its peak, the auxiliary voltage, when added to the power line voltage, would normally cause a very high instantaneuos voltage between terminals V+ and V- to be present, if not for a switching feedback arrangement instant response. The resonant oscillator having the feedback transformer responsive to the instantaneous magnitude of the pulsating current, adjusts its frequency in such a way, that the auxiliary voltage is instantly adjusted to effect the amplitude of the variable DC voltage to be instantly lowered, as shown in FIG.13(b). The transistors' duty cycle is also instantly adjusted. The complete circuit is naturally and automatically synchronized and self-controlled. The resonant frequency associated with the resonant oscillator is also chosen to satisfy a fundamental reliability rule of this type of device: impedance of the resonant circuit shall be always inductive, despite of variations of the load magnitude or power line voltage magnitude. In order to produce a high power factor and a low THD, the boosting capacitance and boosting inductance are tuned to relatively the same frequency as is the oscillation frequency of the resonant oscillator RO1.</p>
    <p>The voltage separating diode VSD permits charging of the energy-storage capacitor SC, whenever the variable DC voltage rises above voltage present at the time across the capacitor SC. Thereby, a constant DC voltage is developed across terminals of the capacitor SC, as shown in FIG. 13(c). The alternately conducting transitors Q1, Q2 are operated by the feedback transformer FT to connect the resonant oscillator circuit RO1 alternately to the variable DC voltage developed between terminals V+, V-, and to a voltage equal to a sum of instantaneous magnitudes of the constant DC voltage and the variable DC voltage. Thus, the constant DC voltage serves as an effective energy reserve, activated when is needed to provide a relatively constant power to the lamp-load, over the cycle of the alternating voltage provided by the source AVS.</p>
    <p>Naturally, the energy-storage capacitor SC is being partially charged from the power line and partially from the energy storing boosting capacitors and boosting inductor BI. In result, the waveform of the current drawn from the power line become proportional to the voltage waveform of that line. Then, the power factor of the entire device is near 0.99 and total harmonic distortion of the current drawn from the power line is less than 10 percent.</p>
    <p>At the time, when the power line voltage is at its negative half cycle, the diodes D1 and D4 are conducting the continous line current, and the diodes D2 and D3 are conducting the pulsating current. The diodes D2, D3 perform a boost switching function, when the diodes D1, D4 perform a boost rectifying function. The two pairs of diodes reverse their functions, when the power line voltage reverses from positive to negative and vice-versa. Also, the boosting capacitors C2 and C3 along with the boosting inductor BI provide the auxiliary voltage across terminals V+ and V-. All other functions of the device components are the same as in the positive half-cycle of the power line voltage.</p>
    <p>FIG.5, attached hereto, represents the device in its second embodiment. The circuit shown here is identical in operation to the one of FIG. 1, with the exception that the resonant elements are connected here in parallel. The switching feedback is accomplished with use of secondary windings L4, L5 operable to provide switching signal proportional to the pulsating voltage which is developed across both resonant elements.</p>
    <p>Device of FIG.6 is the alternative version of devices of FIG. 1 and FIG. 5, wherein the switching signal provided to the switching transistors Q1, Q2 is a combination of: (i) signal proportional to the resonant voltage and provided by windings L6 and L7, and (ii) signal proportional to the pulsating current provided by the feedback transformer. Otherwise, the circuit of FIG.6 is identical in operation to the circuit of FIG.1.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG.7, in the circuit of the third embodiment of the device, the switching feedback arrangement is substituted by a switching control circuit CC. The frequency of switching is dynamically controlled in reference to the variable DC voltage amplitude developed between terminals V+ and V-. Otherwise, the device operates identically to the device of FIG. 1.</p>
