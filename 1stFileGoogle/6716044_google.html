Electrical connector assemblies typically comprise a male connector, commonly called a plug, and a female connector, commonly called a receptacle. The separation of an electrical connector assembly is accomplished by at least one lever disposed in the body of at least one of the connectors. The lever is attached to the body of the connector such that when the lever is “up” the lower portion of the lever is flush with the mating surface so as not to not interfere with the coupling of the connector. Actuation of the lever, i.e., moving the lever to its down position, causes a displacement of at least one of the connectors comprising the electrical connector assembly. The present invention may be adapted to a wide range of electrical connectors including, but not limited to: standard household plug and sockets, parallel connectors, serial connectors, and inline connectors.</div>

    <p>This application is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 09/901,248, filed Jul. 9, 2001, and claims the benefit thereof.</p>
    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention is in the field of electrical connectors. Specifically, the present invention is related to assisted-release electrical connectors.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading> <p>Many electrical devices rely upon electrical cables such as power cords to connect the device to a power source, such as a wall-mounted electrical outlet. Additional electrical cables, such as extension cords, are often required to extend the range of the electrical device from an outlet due to limited outlet availability or because the power cord of the electrical device is too short to reach an available outlet.</p>
    <p>An electrical cable typically comprises insulated conductors, such as wire, of a desired length. Typically, one end of the electrical cable terminates in a male connector, while the opposite end terminates in the electrical device or a female connector. Connectors are designed to terminate conductors and cables between electrical circuits within a system, between systems, and between systems and external power sources and signal lines.</p>
    <p>A male electrical connector is commonly referred to as a “plug.” Female electrical connectors are also commonly called “receptacles,” “sockets,” “jacks,” or “outlets.” Examples of plugs in the art include, but are not limited to a flat blade plug as shown in FIG. 1A (along with an electrical outlet), and a flat blade plug with a grounding terminal as shown in FIG. 1B. A male electrical connector, i.e., plug, typically mates with a female connector of the same size and number of conductors.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 2, a male electrical connector <b>200</b> may comprise a body <b>202</b> made from an electrically insulative material. The body <b>202</b> has a mating surface <b>204</b> from which conductive projections <b>206</b> extend. The mating surface <b>204</b> can be pressed substantially against a mating surface <b>304</b> of a female connector (shown in FIG. 3) so as to place the two connectors in electrical communication. The body <b>202</b> of the male connector typically houses the electrical connection (not shown) between the conductors in an electrical cable <b>208</b> and the conductive projections <b>206</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 3, a female electrical connector <b>300</b> may comprise a body <b>302</b> made from an electrically insulative material. The body <b>302</b> has a mating surface <b>304</b> in which cavities <b>306</b> are formed. The cavities <b>306</b> contain conductive receivers <b>308</b> adapted to accept the insertion of conductive projections <b>206</b> (shown in FIG. <b>2</b>). The body <b>302</b> of the female electrical connector <b>300</b> typically encapsulates the connection (not shown) between the conductors within an electrical cable <b>310</b> and the conductive receivers <b>308</b>.</p>
    <p>Typically, a plug is held in a receptacle after insertion due to a friction fit between the conductive projections of the male connector and the corresponding conductive receivers of the female connector. The friction fit is due to the insertion force required to overcome the interaction of the conductive projections of the male connector with the conductive receivers of the female connector when coupling the connectors, and is a desirable characteristic in order to achieve and maintain a good electrical connection.</p>
    <p>A male connector coupled with a female connector is referred to as a “connector assembly.” A connector assembly can typically be uncoupled by applying sufficient force to pull the male and female connectors apart. However, the amount of force required to uncouple the connectors can often be excessive for a number of reasons, creating difficulty in separating the connectors. Connector assemblies can also be difficult to uncouple if the connector assembly is located in a partially obstructed or difficult-to-reach area such as behind furniture. Another factor that can make connector assemblies more difficult to uncouple is the addition of more conductors, such as a grounding terminal, which increases the friction fit between the male and female connectors and changes the overall dynamics of the uncoupling process. A partially separated connector assembly is an undesired condition, as it exposes the conductive projections of the male connector, creating a shock hazard. In addition, another conductive material could contact the exposed projections and cause a short circuit or fire.</p>
    <p>Prior attempts have been made to solve this problem. For example, Schlums U.S. Pat. No. 2,051,425 teaches an electric plug having a cammed means for detaching the plug from a receptacle. The detaching means comprises a cam having an outer arm portion and an actuator portion. To uncouple the plug from the socket, the outer arm portion of the cam is depressed, causing the actuator portion to apply an oblique force against the mating surface of the receptacle, urging the plug from the receptacle due to the curvature of the actuator portion. The amount of mechanical advantage employed by the cam decreases as the outer arm portion of the cam is moved toward the plug's housing. The stated purpose for this configuration is to match the mechanical advantage of the cam to the detaching force required, the rationale being that a greater amount of force is required to initiate separation of the plug and receptacle when the surface area contact between the male and female connectors is the greatest. The amount of force required decreases as the plug and receptacle separate.</p>
    <p>The movement of a representative cam as disclosed by Schlums is depicted in FIG. <b>4</b>. As an outer arm portion <b>402</b> of a cam <b>400</b> is pressed downward, the cam <b>400</b> rotates about a fulcrum <b>404</b>. As the cam <b>400</b> rotates, an actuator portion <b>406</b> extends laterally to apply force against a mating surface <b>408</b> of a receptacle. As can be seen, the amount of lateral movement exhibited by the actuator portion <b>406</b> as the cam is rotated from position a1 to positions a2 and a3 is limited due to the curvature of the actuator portion <b>406</b>, which is necessary to effect a varying mechanical advantage. Thus, to achieve the amount of cam actuator movement necessary to ensure separation of the plug and receptacle the cam as taught by Schlums would require a larger connector housing than is practical for modern power connectors.</p>
    <p>An alternate embodiment of the electric plug as taught by Schlums features a single cam of the type generally depicted in FIG. 5 situated between the conducting projections of a male connector. The actuator portion <b>406</b>′ of this cam <b>400</b>′ is shaped with less curvature than the cam shown in FIG. 4 such that the actuator portion <b>406</b>′ has little variation in mechanical advantage. In this configuration, a smaller contacting portion <b>510</b> of the actuator portion <b>406</b>′ comes into contact with the mating surface <b>408</b>′ of a receptacle. Although the cam <b>400</b>′ exhibits greater lateral movement than the cam shown in FIG. 4, the amount of lateral movement is still less than necessary to ensure complete disengagement of the connector assembly.</p>
    <p>The cams shown in FIGS. 4 and 5 both suffer from limited lateral movement of the actuator portion <b>406</b>, <b>406</b>′, which can result in incomplete disengagement of the plug and receptacle. In addition, the amount of lateral movement provided by the actuator portion <b>406</b>, <b>406</b>′ is not proportional to the movement of the outer arm <b>402</b>, <b>402</b>′. As a result, the plug begins separating from the receptacle at a slow rate as the cam <b>400</b>, <b>400</b>′ moves from position a1 to position a2, and accelerates as the connector disengagement cycle continues to position a3. The partially exposed conductive projections of the plug create a risk of arcing between conductors, short circuits, and electrical shock. Thus, it is desirable not only to ensure complete disengagement of the plug and receptacle, but also to minimize the time required to disengage the plug from the receptacle.</p>
    <p>A further limitation of the device disclosed by Schlums is that a suitably sized actuator portion would likely interfere with a third conductor, such as the grounding terminal commonly found on modern power cords. Reducing the size of the actuator portion of the cam to eliminate such interference would only further serve to exacerbate the aforementioned limitations on lateral movement of the actuator portion of the cam, hindering full disengagement of the plug and receptacle. The grounding terminal also increases the amount of friction between the connectors. In addition, the grounding terminal extends farther than the conductive projections carrying electrical power. This is intended for safety purposes, to keep the equipment attached to the connector in a grounded state before the conductive projections carrying power are engaged and after they are disengaged. Thus, friction between mating connectors is present for a greater disengagement distance, which can cause problems for cam actuators due to their limited lateral movement and decreasing mechanical advantage during the disengagement cycle. As a result, more force must be exerted on the cam actuator to overcome the additional friction due to the grounding terminal. Moreover, the connectors may not be completely separated due to the limited lateral travel of the cam actuator.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, a need exists to provide an electrical connector that can easily and conveniently be decoupled from its mating connector with minimal force. There is also a need for an electrical connector that can be easily separated from its mated connector when the electrical connector assembly is located in an obstructed or difficult-to-reach area. Yet another need exists to ensure rapid and complete separation of coupled electrical connector assemblies.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Preferred embodiments of the present invention satisfy the above-enumerated needs. In addition, it will be appreciated that similar advantages may be obtained in other applications of the present invention. Such advantages may become apparent from the present disclosure or through practice of the present invention.</p>
    <p>The present invention provides an improved electrical connector as well as a method for separating coupled connectors in an electrical connector assembly. The ejectable electrical connector may be a male connector, a female connector, or any other similar, suitable, or conventional type of connector. An example of a male ejectable electrical connector is a plug, and examples of female ejectable electrical connectors include jacks, sockets, receptacles, and wall outlets. The ejectable electrical connector according to one embodiment of the invention includes a lever that is pivotally connected to the body. The lever includes an actuator portion shaped to maximize lateral movement in order to effect a substantially full detachment of the coupled connector assembly components when actuated. In addition, the lever is shaped to disengage the connectors more quickly than the prior art, thus minimizing the risk of electrical shocks, arcing, and short circuits. Gripping force may be applied to both an upper portion of the lever and the bottom surface of the connector, thereby causing the lower, opposing portion of the lever to rapidly extend from the mating surface of the ejectable electrical connector. The lever may be pivotally attached to the body of the connector in such a way as to not interfere with the connection between mating connectors during engagement. The ejectable electrical connector may be a part of an electrical connector assembly. Electrical connector assemblies may comprise a male connector, e.g., a plug, that is engaged with a female connector, e.g., a receptacle such as a wall outlet. In the present invention, the decoupling of an electrical connector assembly is accomplished by manual actuation of at least one lever that is pivotally connected to the body of at least one of the connectors.</p>
    <p>The limitations of the prior art cam are overcome with a “type 1” lever. A type 1 lever is defined by physics convention as a lever wherein the fulcrum is situated between the applied force and the load. A type 1 lever provides a constant mechanical advantage, the amount of the mechanical advantage depending on the position of the fulcrum in relation to the applied force and the load. The mechanical advantage of a type 1 lever increases as the fulcrum is moved farther away from the applied force and closer to the load. This constant mechanical advantage provides more separation force throughout the connector assembly separation process, a desirable characteristic for particularly stubborn connector assemblies or connectors having greater numbers of conductors and thus a higher friction fit.</p>
    <p>In addition, a type 1 lever can provide greater actuator displacement than the prior art cam, ensuring complete separation of the plug and receptacle. The type 1 lever, unlike a cam, may be accommodated by the smaller housing seen in modern connectors without compromise to the lever's travel effectiveness. A type 1 lever may also be fitted to three-conductor grounded plugs without interfering with the grounding terminal or limiting the movement of the actuator portion of the lever.</p>
    <p>The direction of movement of the lower portion of a type 1 lever differs from the actuator portion of a cam, in that a cam exhibits a sliding action against the mating surface of the opposing connector, whereas the lower portion of a type 1 lever applies the disengaging force directly against a focused area of the mating surface of the opposing connector. This results in a faster disengagement of the connector assembly for a corresponding movement of the lever, reducing the risk of arcing, electrical shocks, and short circuits.</p>
    <p>Although a type 1 lever is the preferred embodiment for the present invention, it should be noted that other levers, such as type 2 and type 3 levers, may also be utilized.</p>
    <p>The present invention is not limited to any specific type or use of electrical connector. In fact, the levered ejector disclosed herein is not limited to electrical-type connectors. One preferred embodiment of the present invention is particularly useful with two-conductor or three-conductor, male or female electrical connectors, e.g., with electrical cables, extension cords, or other similar, suitable, or conventional electrical cables. Nevertheless, the present invention may be implemented with any of the connectors described above in the background as well as other similar, suitable, or conventional connectors that are now known or may be later developed. Examples of other connectors to which the present invention may be applied include, but should not be limited to, serial data connectors, parallel data connectors, and in-line connectors. The connectors may be used for any suitable purpose such as for electrical power distribution (e.g., with power strips, wall outlets, power cords, extension cords, and other similar, suitable, or conventional power distribution systems), data transmission, control signal transmission, response signal transmission, timing signal transmission, and other similar, suitable, or conventional uses that are now known or may be later developed. In addition, it should be recognized that the present invention may be used to separate connector/wall outlet assemblies as well as any other similar, suitable, or conventional type of electrical connector assembly. The present invention may also be utilized in non-electrical connectors, such as mechanical couplings in which components are coupled together through the use of friction between the mating surfaces. Such coupled mechanical connections may be purely mechanical or otherwise used to convey some medium from one connector to the other.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p>In accordance with the foregoing summary, the following presents a detailed description of what is considered the preferred embodiments of the invention.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 6A, <b>6</b>B and <b>6</b>C show side views of a male ejectable electrical connector <b>600</b> of the present invention. This embodiment of the male ejectable electrical connector <b>600</b> comprises a body <b>602</b> having a side surface <b>603</b> and a mating surface <b>620</b>, conductive projections <b>604</b>, a lever attachment means <b>606</b>, and a lever <b>608</b> that is pivotally or rotatably connected to the body <b>602</b>. Internal wiring connections between the conductive projections <b>604</b> and the conductors within a cable <b>618</b> have not been shown for the sake of clarity. In this example, the lever <b>608</b> is mounted at least partially in a channel <b>622</b> of the body <b>602</b>. However, in other embodiments, the lever <b>608</b> may be located along an outside portion of the body <b>602</b>. The lever <b>608</b> may be comprised of an upper portion <b>610</b>, an engagement means <b>612</b>, and a lower portion <b>614</b>. The lever <b>608</b> is pivotally or rotatably connected to the body <b>602</b>. Any suitable combination of attachment means <b>606</b> and engagement means <b>612</b> may be used to pivotally or rotatably connect the lever <b>600</b> to the body <b>602</b>. Examples of suitable attachment means <b>606</b> include, but are not limited to, female connecting portions, male connecting portions, posts, holes, apertures, receptacles, rods, axles, pins, chains, sprockets, belts, pulleys, balls, sockets, hinges, trunnions, and clips. Similarly, examples of suitable engagement means <b>612</b> include, but are not limited to, female connecting portions, male connecting portions, posts, holes, apertures, receptacles, rods, axles, pins, chains, sprockets, belts, pulleys, balls, sockets, hinges, trunnions, and clips. In this particular example, posts <b>612</b> are adapted to rotate in respective apertures <b>606</b>. As a result, the attachment means <b>606</b> and engagement means <b>612</b> cooperate in order to permit the lever <b>608</b> to pivot or rotate in relation to the body <b>602</b>.</p>
    <p>The lever <b>608</b> may have three main portions: an upper portion <b>610</b>, an engagement means <b>612</b>, and a lower portion <b>614</b>. The upper portion <b>610</b> is that portion of the lever <b>608</b> upon which a user may apply a force to the lever. The engagement means <b>612</b> of the lever interacts with the attachment means <b>606</b> of the body to form the fulcrum and pivotally connect the lever <b>608</b> to the body <b>602</b> of the male ejectable electrical connector <b>600</b>. The lower portion <b>614</b> of the lever <b>608</b> may reside at least partially in the channel <b>622</b> of the body <b>602</b> when the lever is an up or closed position. When the lever <b>608</b> is moved to a down or open position, the lower portion <b>614</b> of the lever contacts the female electrical connector, preferably the mating surface, to urge the male ejectable electrical connector away from the female electrical connector of the connector assembly. The lever is configured such that the fulcrum point does not change as the lever is rotated through its range of motion. The amount of mechanical advantage is thus also fixed, making the lever more capable than cam actuators for ejecting connectors with additional conductors such as grounding terminals. More importantly, the amount of movement of the actuator portion of the lever is much greater than the cam taught by the prior art, ensuring rapid and full disengagement of the plug and receptacle.</p>
    <p>The upper portion <b>610</b> of the lever <b>608</b> is where a person may exert a force to separate the male ejectable electrical connector <b>600</b> from a receptacle of an electrical connector assembly. Although not required, the force may be applied by gripping the upper portion <b>610</b> and the bottom of the body <b>602</b> between the thumb and a portion of the index finger, and applying pressure. It is preferred that the upper portion <b>610</b> of the lever <b>608</b> comprises a finger pad portion <b>616</b> for the comfortable placement of a human finger to exert a force upon. The finger pad may have a textured and/or contoured surface to ensure good contact between the finger pad and the user's fingers, as well as to provide positive tactile feedback to the user.</p>
    <p>FIG. 7 shows a side view of a female ejectable electrical connector <b>700</b> of the present invention. The female ejectable electrical connector <b>700</b> may include any of the optional or preferred features of the male ejectable electrical connector <b>600</b>. The female ejectable connector <b>700</b> comprises a body <b>702</b> having a side surface <b>703</b> and a mating surface <b>720</b>, conductive receivers <b>704</b>, an attachment means <b>606</b>′, and a lever <b>608</b>′ that is connected to the body <b>702</b>. Internal wiring connections between the conductive receivers <b>704</b> and the conductors of a cable <b>618</b>′ have not been shown for the sake of clarity. The lever <b>608</b>′ may be comprised of an upper portion <b>610</b>′, an engagement means <b>612</b>′ and a lower portion <b>614</b>′. In this example, the lever <b>608</b>′ is mounted at least partially in a channel <b>622</b> of the body <b>702</b>. However, in other embodiments, the lever <b>608</b>′ may be located along an outside portion of the body <b>702</b>. The lever <b>608</b>′ is pivotally or rotatably connected to the body <b>702</b>. Any suitable combination of attachment means <b>606</b>′ and engagement means <b>612</b>′ may be used to pivotally or rotatably connect the lever <b>608</b>′ to the body <b>702</b>. Examples of suitable attachment means <b>606</b>′ include, but are not limited to, female connecting portions, male connecting portions, posts, holes, receptacles, apertures, rods, axles, pins, chains, sprockets, belts, pulleys, balls, sockets, hinges, trunnions, and clips. Similarly, examples of suitable engagement means <b>612</b>′ include, but are not limited to, female connecting portions, male connecting portions, posts, holes, apertures, receptacles, rods, axles, pins, chains, sprockets, belts, pulleys, balls, sockets, hinges, trunnions, and clips. In this particular example, posts <b>612</b>′ are adapted to rotate in respective apertures <b>606</b>′. As a result, the attachment means <b>606</b>′ and engagement means <b>612</b>′ cooperate in order to permit the lever <b>608</b>′ to pivot or rotate in relation to the body <b>702</b>.</p>
    <p>A person may actuate the ejector by applying a downward force on the upper portion <b>610</b>′ of the lever <b>608</b>′ to separate the female ejectable electrical connector <b>700</b> from a male electrical connector of an electrical connector assembly. It is preferred that the upper portion <b>610</b>′ of the lever <b>608</b>′ comprises a finger pad portion <b>616</b>′ for the comfortable placement of a human finger to exert a force upon. The finger pad may have a textured and/or contoured surface to ensure good contact between the finger pad and the user's fingers, as well as to provide positive tactile feedback to the user.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIGS. 8 and 9, the lever <b>608</b> of the present invention is shown to provide greater lateral movement than the cams <b>400</b>, <b>400</b>′ of the previously discussed prior art. In addition, the lower portion <b>614</b> of the lever moves laterally at a faster rate than the actuator portion <b>406</b>, <b>406</b>′ of the prior art. This is due to the lower portion <b>614</b> of the lever moving laterally in direct proportion to movement of the upper portion <b>610</b>, providing faster disengagement of the connector assembly and thereby decreasing the risk of electrical shocks, arcing, and short circuits. This is depicted graphically in FIGS. 8 and 9 by comparing the movement of the actuator portion <b>406</b>, <b>406</b>′ of embodiments of the prior art and the lower portion <b>614</b> of the lever <b>608</b> in accordance with the present invention as the lever is rotated from position a<b>1</b> to positions a<b>2</b> and a<b>3</b> and the cam <b>400</b>, <b>400</b>′ is rotated from position b<b>1</b> to positions b<b>2</b> and b<b>3</b>. It may also be seen that the upper portion <b>610</b> of the lever <b>608</b> requires less angular displacement for a given movement of the lower portion <b>614</b>, in comparison to the movement of the outer arm portion <b>402</b>, <b>402</b>′ and actuator portion <b>406</b>, <b>406</b>′ of the cam <b>400</b>, <b>400</b>′, making the lever <b>608</b> compatible with smaller electrical connector bodies.</p>
    <p>The present invention may also be implemented in connectors that have a combination of male and female conductive portions. Additionally, one or each connector of an electrical connector assembly may be an ejectable electrical connector of the present invention. The following examples will discuss the present invention in further detail.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE ONE</heading> <heading>Only Male Connector Having an Ejection Lever</heading> <p>In this embodiment, the disengagement of the male ejectable electrical connector from the female electrical connector is accomplished by a lever mounted to the male ejectable electrical connector. FIG. 10 shows the body <b>602</b> of a male ejectable electrical connector of the present invention which has a channel <b>622</b> extending from a side surface <b>603</b> to the mating surface <b>620</b>. The lever <b>608</b> is not shown in order to more clearly show the channel <b>622</b>. The channel <b>622</b> may have any suitable shape to allow the lever to rotate or pivot from an up or closed position to a down or open position. Any suitable portion of the body <b>602</b> may form attachment means <b>606</b>. In this example, the attachment means <b>606</b> is formed at an edge of the side surface <b>603</b> and the mating surface <b>620</b>. The attachment means <b>606</b> interacts with engagement means on the lever (not shown) to connect the lever to the body <b>602</b> of the male connector. As noted above, the attachment means may be a post or any other suitable attachment device adapted to engage the engagement means of the lever to pivotally connect the lever to the body <b>602</b>. The attachment means <b>606</b> and the engagement means of the lever act together to form the fulcrum point of the lever.</p>
    <p>When the lever <b>608</b> of a male ejectable connector <b>600</b> is in the up position as seen in FIG. 11A, the lower portion <b>614</b> of the lever <b>608</b> may be substantially enclosed by the channel <b>622</b> and substantially flush with the mating surface <b>620</b> of the connector. However, in alternative embodiments, the lower portion <b>614</b> of the lever <b>608</b> may protrude from, or be recessed from, the mating surface <b>620</b>. As the lever <b>608</b> is moved towards its down position, the upper portion <b>610</b> of the lever <b>608</b> moves towards the body <b>602</b> of the connector <b>600</b> while the lower portion <b>614</b> simultaneously moves outward from the mating surface <b>620</b>, as in FIG. <b>11</b>B. The lower portion <b>614</b> contacts the mating surface <b>304</b> of the female electrical connector <b>300</b> and urges the female electrical connector <b>300</b> away from the male ejectable electrical connector <b>600</b>. As shown in FIG. 11C, upon reaching the down position, the upper portion <b>610</b> of the lever <b>608</b> rests against the body <b>602</b> of the connector <b>600</b> and the lower portion <b>614</b> of the lever <b>608</b> is fully extended. Furthermore, the male ejectable electrical connector <b>600</b> and the female electrical connector <b>300</b> are fully disengaged.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE TWO</heading> <heading>Only Female Connector Having an Lever</heading> <p>With reference to FIGS. 2 and 7, in this embodiment the disengagement of the female ejectable electrical connector <b>700</b> from the male electrical connector <b>200</b> is accomplished by a lever <b>608</b>′. The rotation of the lever <b>608</b>′ about a fulcrum formed by an attachment means <b>606</b>′ and an engagement means <b>612</b>′ causes the lower portion <b>614</b>′ of the lever to contact the mating surface <b>204</b> of the male electrical connector <b>200</b>. As the lever <b>608</b>′ is moved to its down position, the conductive projections <b>206</b> of the male electrical connector <b>200</b> are urged from the conductive receivers <b>704</b> of the female ejectable electrical connector <b>700</b>. This embodiment may include any of the optional or preferred features of the previous embodiments.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE THREE</heading> <heading>Both Male and Female Connectors Having Levers</heading> <p>With reference to FIGS. 6 and 7, in this embodiment the disengagement of a male ejectable electrical connector <b>600</b> from a female ejectable electrical connector is accomplished by a lever <b>608</b> disposed in male ejectable electrical connector <b>600</b>, and by a lever <b>608</b>′ disposed in a female ejectable electrical connector <b>700</b>. The male ejectable electrical connector and the female ejectable electrical connector may include any of the optional or preferred features of the above described embodiments. In order to separate the connectors <b>600</b>, <b>700</b>, either or both of the levers <b>608</b>, <b>608</b>′ of the connectors may be actuated. The lower portions <b>614</b>, <b>614</b>′ of the levers <b>608</b>, <b>608</b>′ may be offset or aligned in relation to each other. Consequently, when the levers are moved to their down positions, the lower portions <b>614</b>, <b>614</b>′ of the levers may abut each other or the opposing mating surfaces <b>620</b>, <b>720</b> to push apart the connectors.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE 4</heading> <heading>Connector Having a Cable Disposed at an Angle Relative to the Male or Female Conductive Portions</heading> <p>The lever of the present invention may have any shape which is suitable for the particular application. FIGS. 12A and 12B show one example of an alternative shape of a lever of the present invention. In this example, a cable <b>618</b>′ terminates in a connector body <b>602</b>′. Male conductive projections <b>604</b>′ extend from the connector body <b>602</b>′ at an angle relative to the cable <b>618</b>′. In this particular example, the angle is about 90 degrees. Nevertheless, it should be recognized that the relationship between the cable <b>618</b>′ and the conductive projections <b>604</b>′ may be any angle greater or less than 90 degrees. A lever <b>608</b>′ is pivotally or rotatably mounted to the connector body <b>602</b>′. The lever <b>608</b>′ may include any of the optional or preferred features of the levers described above. The lever <b>608</b>′ of this example is mounted in a channel <b>622</b>′ and has a curved or contoured upper portion <b>610</b>′. The degree of curvature of the upper portion <b>610</b>′ may be any amount. In this example, the upper portion <b>610</b>′ has about a 90 degree curve such that the upper portion <b>610</b>′ substantially rests against the side surface <b>603</b>′ of the connector body <b>602</b>′ when the lever <b>608</b>′ is in a down position. Such an embodiment may be useful to limit the amount of space used by the present invention. This embodiment of the present invention may also be implemented in connectors having female conductive receivers.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE 5</heading> <heading>Lever Biased in an Up Position</heading> <p>The lever of the present invention may be biased in an up position, providing benefits not recognized in the prior art, such as Schlums U.S. Pat. No. 2,051,425. Schlums teaches away from an upward-biasing means, instead disclosing a means for biasing the outer arms of one or more cams in a downward direction to keep the outer arms stowed against the connector housing until the plug is mated with a receptacle. This is intended to reduce the risk of damage to the outer arms during handling of the plug. In contrast, the present invention utilizes a type 1 lever wherein the upper portion of the lever is biased in an upward direction, causing the lower portion of the lever to remain flush with the mating surface of the connector. This eliminates the additional effort required in the prior art to overcome the force of the biasing means in addition to the frictional force that must be overcome to engage the connectors. A further benefit of upward-biasing the upper portion of the lever is that the upper portion is held away from the body of the connector so as to not interfere with engagement of the connector, which can happen in the prior art if the outer arm of the cam is obstructed when attempting to engage the connector.</p>
    <p>In the example shown in FIGS. 13A and 13B, the lever <b>608</b>′ is biased in an up position by a biasing means <b>1302</b> or any other similar, suitable, or conventional device that may be biased in a certain direction or position. Examples of biasing means <b>1302</b> include, but are not limited to, a torsion spring, a compression spring, an extension spring, a leaf spring, or any other similar, suitable, or conventional type of spring. Further, the biasing means may be constructed of any suitable material, such as metal, plastic, and composites.</p>
    <p>The biasing means <b>1302</b> may be connected to the connector body <b>602</b>′ in any suitable manner. In this example, the biasing means <b>1302</b> is located in the channel <b>622</b>′ of the body <b>602</b>′ and connected to the engagement means <b>612</b>′ of the lever <b>608</b>′. In other embodiments, the biasing means <b>1302</b> may be connected to the attachment means (not shown) of the body <b>602</b>′. In addition, it should be recognized that the biasing means <b>1302</b> may be located outside of the channel <b>622</b>′ in alternative embodiments.</p>
    <p>The biasing means <b>1302</b> may be connected to any portion of the lever <b>608</b>′ in order to bias the lever <b>608</b>′ in the desired direction. As shown in the example of FIGS. 13A and 13B, the biasing means <b>1302</b> may rest against an upper portion <b>610</b>′ of the lever <b>608</b>′. Biasing the lever <b>608</b>′ in an up position may be useful to keep the lever <b>608</b>′ out of the way when engaging two connectors together. The biasing means <b>1302</b> may have any tension which is suitable for the intended purpose. In order to disconnect two connectors, the lever <b>608</b>′ may be moved to a down position as shown in FIG. <b>13</b>B.</p>
    <p>The biasing means may also be formed as an integral, monolithic portion of the lever to reduce manufacturing and assembly costs. An example of an integral, monolithic spring is shown in FIGS. 14A and 14B. A monolithic leaf spring <b>1402</b> is formed as an integral portion of the lever <b>608</b>′. The lever <b>608</b>′ is mounted in a channel <b>622</b>′ and is pivotally or rotatably connected to the body <b>602</b>′ by an attachment means <b>606</b>′ and an engagement means <b>612</b>′. The monolithic spring <b>1402</b> is in contact with the channel <b>622</b>′, and deflects downward as shown in FIG. 14B when the upper portion <b>610</b>′ of the lever <b>608</b>′ is moved to its down position. When the upper portion <b>610</b>′ is released, the tension present in the leaf spring <b>1402</b> urges the upper portion <b>610</b>′ to its up position, as shown in FIG. <b>14</b>A.</p>
    <p>These embodiments of the present invention may include any of the optional or preferred features of the earlier described embodiments of the present invention. Although the figures show a connector having male conductive projections, it should be recognized that this embodiment of the present invention may also be implemented in a connector having female conductive receivers.</p>
    <p>The exemplary embodiments herein disclosed are not intended to be exhaustive or to unnecessarily limit the scope of the invention. The exemplary embodiments were chosen and described in order to explain the principles of the present invention so that others skilled in the art may practice the invention. Having shown and described exemplary embodiments of the present invention, those skilled in the art will realize that many variations and modifications may be made to affect the described invention.
