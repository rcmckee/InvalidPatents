    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading> <p num="p-0005">This invention relates to radio frequency communication devices. More particularly, the invention relates to radio frequency identification devices for inventory control, object monitoring, or for determining the existence, location or movement of objects.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0006">As large numbers of objects are moved in inventory, product manufacturing, and merchandising operations, there is a continuous challenge to accurately monitor the location and flow of objects. Additionally, there is a continuing goal to interrogate the location of objects in an inexpensive and streamlined manner. Furthermore, there is a need for tag devices suitably configured to mount to a variety of objects including goods, items, persons, or animals, or substantially any moving or stationary and animate or inanimate object. One way of tracking objects is with an electronic identification system.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">One presently available electronic identification system utilizes a magnetic field modulation system to monitor tag devices. An interrogator creates a magnetic field that becomes detuned when the tag device is passed through the magnetic field. In some cases, the tag device may be provided with a unique identification code in order to distinguish between a number of different tags. Typically, the tag devices are entirely passive (have no power supply), which results in a small and portable package. However, this identification system is only capable of distinguishing a limited number of tag devices, over a relatively short range, limited by the size of a magnetic field used to supply power to the tags and to communicate with the tags.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">Another electronic identification system utilizes an RF transponder device affixed to an object to be monitored, in which an interrogator transmits an interrogation signal to the device. The device receives the signal, then generates and transmits a responsive signal. The interrogation signal and the responsive signal are typically radio-frequency (RF) signals produced by an RF transmitter circuit. Since RF signals can be transmitted over greater distances than magnetic fields, RF-based transponder devices tend to be more suitable for applications requiring tracking of a tagged device that may not be in close proximity to an interrogator. For example, RF-based transponder devices tend to be more suitable for inventory control or tracking.</p>

    <p num="h-0008">Overview of Device</p>
    <p num="p-0011">FIG. 1 illustrates a radio frequency data communication device <b>12</b> embodying the invention. The radio frequency data communication device <b>12</b> includes an integrated circuit <b>16</b>, a power source <b>18</b> connected to the integrated circuit <b>16</b> to supply power to the integrated circuit <b>16</b>, and at least one antenna <b>14</b> connected to the integrated circuit <b>16</b> for radio frequency transmission and reception by the integrated circuit <b>16</b>. For purposes of this disclosure, including the appended claims, the term “integrated circuit” shall be defined as a combination of interconnected circuit elements inseparably associated on or within a continuous substrate. For purposes of this disclosure, including the appended claims, the term “semiconductive substrate” is defined to mean any construction comprising semiconductive material, including, but not limited to, bulk semiconductive materials such as a semiconductive wafer (either alone or in assemblies comprising other materials thereon), and semiconductive material layers (either alone or in assemblies comprising other materials). For purposes of this disclosure, including the appended claims, the term “substrate” refers to any supporting structure, including, but not limited to, the semiconductive substrates described above. In the illustrated embodiment, the integrated circuit <b>16</b> is a monolithic integrated circuit. For purposes of this disclosure, including the appended claims, the term “monolithic integrated circuit” shall be defined as an integrated circuit wherein all circuit components are manufactured into or on top of a single chip of silicon. The integrated circuit <b>16</b> will be described in greater detail below. The power source <b>18</b> is a battery or other suitable power source.</p>
    <p num="h-0009">Housing</p>
    <p num="p-0012">The radio frequency data communication device <b>12</b> can be included in any appropriate housing or packaging.</p>
    <p num="p-0013">FIG. 2 shows but one example in the form of an employee identification badge <b>10</b> including the radio frequency data communication device <b>12</b>, and a card <b>11</b> made of plastic or other suitable material. In one embodiment, the radio frequency data communication device <b>12</b> is laminated to the back face of the plastic card <b>11</b>, and the card forms the visible portion of the badge. In another embodiment, the radio frequency data communication device <b>12</b> is bonded to the back face of the card by embedding it within a thin bond line of epoxy-based material. Alternatively, the radio frequency data communication device <b>12</b> is embedded into the plastic card <b>11</b>. In one embodiment, the front face of the badge <b>10</b> has visual identification features including an employee photograph as well as identifying text.</p>
    <p num="p-0014">FIG. 3 illustrates but one alternative housing supporting the device <b>12</b>. More particularly, FIG. 3 shows a miniature housing <b>20</b> encasing the device <b>12</b> to define a tag which can be supported by an object (e.g., hung from an object, affixed to an object, etc.). The housing <b>20</b> preferably has the general shape and size, in plan view, of a postage stamp. The embodiment of FIG. 3 also includes a card <b>21</b> supporting the device <b>12</b> in the housing <b>20</b>. The card <b>21</b> is formed of plastic or other suitable material having a thickness of about 0.040 inches, a width of about 1.25 inches, and a height of about 1.25 inches. In one embodiment, the device <b>12</b> is bonded to a back face of the card <b>21</b> with a thin layer of non-conductive epoxy material that cooperates with the card to define the housing <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0015">Although two particular types of housings have been disclosed, the device <b>12</b> can be included in any appropriate housing. The device <b>12</b> is of a small size that lends itself to applications employing small housings, such as cards, miniature tags, etc. Larger housings can also be employed. The device <b>12</b>, housed in any appropriate housing, can be supported from or attached to an object in any desired manner; for example using double sided tape, glue, lanyards, leash, nails, staples, rivets, or any other fastener. The housing can be sewn on to an object, hung from an object, implanted in an object (hidden), etc.</p>
    <p num="h-0010">Antenna</p>
    <p num="p-0016">Various configurations are possible for the antenna <b>14</b>. The integrated circuit <b>16</b> includes a receiver <b>30</b> and a transmitter <b>32</b> (FIG. 5). In one embodiment, separate antennas <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> are provided for receiver and transmitter of the integrated circuit <b>16</b>. In another embodiment (FIG. 1), a single antenna is shared by the receiver and transmitter sections. In one embodiment, the antenna is defined by conductive epoxy screened onto a card or housing. In the illustrated embodiment, the antenna is conductively bonded to the integrated circuit via bonding pads.</p>
    <p num="p-0017">In an embodiment where a single antenna is employed, that single antenna preferably comprises a folded dipole antenna defining a continuous conductive path, or loop, of microstrip. Alternatively, the antenna can be constructed as a continuous loop antenna.</p>
    <p num="h-0011">Battery</p>
    <p num="p-0018">If the power source <b>18</b> is a battery, the battery can take any suitable form. Preferably, the battery type will be selected depending on weight, size, and life requirements for a particular application. In one embodiment, the battery <b>18</b> is a thin profile button-type cell forming a small, thin energy cell more commonly utilized in watches and small electronic devices requiring a thin profile. A conventional button-type cell has a pair of electrodes, an anode formed by one face and a cathode formed by an opposite face. Exemplary button-type cells are disclosed in several pending U.S. patent applications including U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/205,957, “Button-Type Battery Having Bendable Construction and Angled Button-Type Battery,” listing Mark E. Tuttle and Peter M. Blonsky as inventors; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/321,251, “Button-Type Batteries and Method of Forming Button-Type Batteries,” listing Mark E. Tuttle as inventor; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/348,543, “Method of Forming Button-Type Batteries and a Button-Type Battery Insulating and Sealing Gasket,” listing Mark E. Tuttle as inventor. These patent applications and resulting patents are hereby incorporated by reference. In an alternative embodiment, the battery <b>18</b> comprises a series connected pair of button type cells. Instead of using a battery, any suitable power source can be employed.</p>
    <p num="h-0012">Overview of Communication System</p>
    <p num="p-0019">FIG. 4 illustrates a radio frequency communication system <b>24</b> including the device <b>12</b> and a radio frequency interrogator unit (hereinafter “interrogator”) <b>26</b>. The device <b>12</b> transmits and receives radio frequency communications to and from the interrogator <b>26</b>. Preferably, the interrogator unit <b>26</b> includes an antenna <b>28</b>, as well as dedicated transmitting and receiving circuitry, similar to that implemented on the integrated circuit <b>16</b>. The system <b>24</b> further includes a host computer <b>48</b> in communication with the interrogator <b>26</b>. The host computer <b>48</b> acts as a master in a master-slave relationship with the interrogator <b>26</b>. The host computer <b>48</b> includes an applications program for controlling the interrogator <b>26</b> and interpreting responses, and a library (“MRL”) of radio frequency identification device applications or functions. Most of the functions communicate with the interrogator <b>26</b>. These functions effect radio frequency communication between the interrogator <b>26</b> and the device <b>12</b>. These functions are described below in a section titled “Protocol.”</p>
    <p num="p-0020">One example of an interrogator implemented in combination with a transponder unit is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,857,893, hereby incorporated by reference. Generally, the interrogator <b>26</b> includes an antenna <b>28</b>, and transmits an interrogation signal or command <b>27</b> (“forward link”) via the antenna <b>28</b>. The device <b>12</b> receives the incoming interrogation signal via its antenna <b>14</b>. Upon receiving the signal <b>27</b>, the device <b>12</b> responds by generating and transmitting a responsive signal or reply <b>29</b> (“return link”). Preferably, the responsive signal <b>29</b> is encoded with information that uniquely identifies, or labels the particular device <b>12</b> that is transmitting, so as to identify any object or person with which the device <b>12</b> is associated.</p>
    <p num="p-0021">In the illustrated embodiment in FIG. 4, there is no communication between devices <b>12</b>. Instead, the devices <b>12</b> communicate with the interrogator <b>26</b>. FIG. 4 illustrates the device <b>12</b> as being in the housing <b>20</b> of FIG. 3. The system <b>24</b> would operate in a similar manner if the device <b>12</b> is provided in a housing such as the housing <b>10</b> of FIG. 2, or any other appropriate housing. Multiple devices <b>12</b> can be used in the same field of an interrogator <b>26</b> (i.e., within communications range of an interrogator <b>26</b>). Similarly, multiple interrogators <b>26</b> can be in proximity to one or more of the devices <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0022">Various U.S. patent applications, which are incorporated herein by reference, disclose features that are employed in various alternative embodiments of the invention: Ser. No. 08/092,147, filed Jul. 15, 1993, “Wake Up Device for a Communications System” and continuation application Ser. No. 08/424,827, filed Apr. 19, 1995, “Wake Up Device for a Communications System”; Ser. No. 08/281,384, filed Jul. 27, 1994, “Communication System Having Transmitter Frequency Control”; Ser. No. 07/990,918, filed Dec. 15, 1992, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,365,551, “Data Communication Transceiver Using Identification Protocol”; Ser. No. 07/899,777, filed Jun. 17, 1992, “Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) and Method of Manufacture, Including an Electrical Operating System and Method,” now abandoned; Ser. No. 07/921,037, filed Jul. 24, 1992, “Anti-Theft Method for Detecting The Unauthorized Opening of Containers and Baggage,” now abandoned; Ser. No. 07/928,899, filed Aug. 12, 1992, “Electrically Powered Postage Stamp or Mailing or Shipping Label Operative with Radio Frequency (RF) Communications,” now abandoned; and Ser. No. 08/032,384, filed on Mar. 17, 1993, “Modulated Spread Spectrum in RF Identification Systems Method,” now allowed.</p>
    <p num="p-0023">The above described system <b>24</b> is advantageous over prior art devices that utilize magnetic field effect systems because, with the system <b>24</b>, a greater range can be achieved, and more information can be obtained (instead of just an identification number).</p>
    <p num="p-0024">As a result, such a system <b>24</b> can be used, for example, to monitor large warehouse inventories having many unique products needing individual discrimination to determine the presence of particular items within a large lot of tagged products. The system can also be used to counteract terrorism to monitor luggage entering a plane to ensure that each item of luggage that enters the plane is owned by a passenger who actually boards the plane. Such a technique assumes that a terrorist will not board a plane that he or she is planning to bomb. The system <b>24</b> is useful whenever RF transmission over a large range is desirable, such as for inventory control. In one embodiment, the sensitivity of the devices <b>12</b> is adjustable so that only devices within a certain range of the interrogator <b>26</b> will respond. In another embodiment, the power of the interrogator <b>26</b> is adjustable so that only devices within a certain range of the interrogator <b>26</b> will respond.</p>
    <p num="p-0025">However, a power conservation problem is posed by such implementations where batteries are used to supply power to the integrated circuits <b>16</b>. If the integrated circuit <b>16</b> operates continuously at full power, battery life will be short, and device <b>12</b> will have to be frequently replaced. If the battery <b>18</b> is permanently sealed in a housing, replacement of the battery will be difficult or impossible. For example, one reason for sealing the battery with the integrated circuit <b>16</b> and antenna <b>14</b> in a housing is to simplify the design and construction, to reduce the cost of production, and protect the electrical interconnections between devices. Another reason is protection of the battery and integrated circuit <b>16</b> from moisture and contaminants. A third reason is to enhance the cosmetic appeal of the device <b>12</b> by eliminating the need for an access port or door otherwise necessary to insert and remove the battery. When the battery is discharged, the entire badge or stamp is then discarded. It is therefore desirable in this and other applications to incorporate power conservation techniques into the integrated circuit <b>16</b> in order to extend useful life.</p>
    <p num="p-0026">In one embodiment, the devices <b>12</b> switch between a “sleep” mode of operation, and higher power modes to conserve energy and extend battery life during periods of time where no interrogation signal <b>27</b> is received by the device <b>12</b>. These power conservation techniques are described in greater detail below.</p>
    <p num="p-0027">In one embodiment of the invention, in order to further extend the life of the battery <b>18</b>, the receiver sensitivity of the device <b>12</b> is tuned over a range of tuned and detuned states in order to modify the ability of the device to detect signal <b>27</b>, and therefore adjust the tendency for the device to wake up. One way to adjust the receiver sensitivity is by adjusting the sensitivity, or impedance of the antenna. Another way is by controlling the gain of amplifiers included in the receiver. Another way is to adjust or switch in different circuit elements in the device <b>12</b>, thereby realizing different circuit configurations. Additionally, the transmitting sensitivity for the device <b>12</b> can be adjusted. For example, transmitting range can be adjusted by controlling interrogator continuous wave power if the transmitter is operating in backscatter mode, and by controlling output power if the transmitter is in active mode.</p>
    <p num="h-0013">Overview of Integrated Circuit</p>
    <p num="p-0028">FIG. 5 is a high level circuit schematic of the integrated circuit <b>16</b> utilized in the devices of FIGS. 1-4. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 5, the integrated circuit <b>16</b> is a monolithic integrated circuit. More particularly, in the illustrated embodiment, the integrated circuit <b>16</b> comprises a single die, having a size of 209×116 mils<sup>2</sup>, including the receiver <b>30</b>, the transmitter <b>32</b>, a micro controller or microprocessor <b>34</b>, a wake up timer and logic circuit <b>36</b>, a clock recovery and data recovery circuit <b>38</b>, and a bias voltage and current generator <b>42</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0029">In one embodiment, a spread spectrum processing circuit <b>40</b> is also included in the integrated circuit <b>16</b> and formed relative to the single die. In this embodiment, signals received by the receiver <b>30</b> are modulated spread spectrum signals. Spread spectrum modulation is described below. In the illustrated embodiment, the modulation scheme for replies sent by the transmitter <b>32</b> is selectable. One of the available selections for replies sent by the transmitter <b>32</b> is modulated spread spectrum.</p>
    <p num="h-0014">Spread Spectrum Modulation</p>
    <p num="p-0030">Many modulation techniques minimize required transmission bandwidth. However, the spread spectrum modulation technique employed in the illustrated embodiment requires a transmission bandwidth that is up to several orders of magnitude greater than the minimum required signal bandwidth. Although spread spectrum modulation techniques are bandwidth inefficient in single user applications, they are advantageous where there are multiple users, as is the case with the instant radio frequency identification system <b>24</b>. The spread spectrum modulation technique of the illustrated embodiment is advantageous because the interrogator signal can be distinguished from other signals (e.g., radar, microwave ovens, etc.) operating at the same frequency. The spread spectrum signals transmitted by the device <b>12</b> and by the interrogator <b>26</b> (FIG. 4) are pseudo random and have noise-like properties when compared with the digital command or reply. The spreading waveform is controlled by a pseudo-noise or pseudo random number (PN) sequence or code (described below). The PN code is a binary sequence that appears random but can be reproduced in a predetermined manner by the device <b>12</b>. More particularly, incoming spread spectrum signals are demodulated by the device <b>12</b> through cross correlation with a version of the pseudo random carrier that is generated by the device <b>12</b> itself. Cross correlation with the correct PN sequence unspreads the spread spectrum signal and restores the modulated message in the same narrow band as the original data.</p>
    <p num="p-0031">A pseudo-noise or pseudo random sequence (PN sequence) is a binary sequence with an autocorrelation that resembles, over a period, the autocorrelation of a random binary sequence. The autocorrelation of a pseudo-noise sequence also roughly resembles the autocorrelation of band-limited white noise. A pseudo-noise sequence has many characteristics that are similar to those of random binary sequences. For example, a pseudo-noise sequence has a nearly equal number of zeros and ones, very low correlation between shifted versions of the sequence, and very low cross correlation between any two sequences. A pseudo-noise sequence is usually generated using sequential logic circuits. For example, a pseudo-noise sequence can be generated using a feedback shift register.</p>
    <p num="p-0032">A feedback shift register comprises consecutive stages of two state memory devices, and feedback logic. Binary sequences are shifted through the shift registers in response to clock pulses, and the output of the various stages are logically combined and fed back as the input to the first stage. The initial contents of the memory stages and the feedback logic circuit determine the successive contents of the memory.</p>
    <p num="p-0033">The illustrated embodiment employs direct sequence spread spectrum modulation. A direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) system spreads the baseband data by directly multiplying the baseband data pulses with a pseudo-noise sequence that is produced by a pseudo-noise generator. A single pulse or symbol of the PN waveform is called a “chip.” Synchronized data symbols, which may be information bits or binary channel code symbols, are added in modulo-2 fashion to the chips before being modulated. The receiver performs demodulation. For example, in one embodiment the data is phase modulated, and the receiver performs coherent or differentially coherent phase-shift keying (PSK) demodulation. In another embodiment, the data is amplitude modulated. Assuming that code synchronization has been achieved at the receiver, the received signal passes through a wideband filter and is multiplied by a local replica of the PN code sequence. This multiplication yields the unspread signal.</p>
    <p num="p-0034">A pseudo-noise sequence is usually an odd number of chips long. In the illustrated embodiment, one bit of data is represented by a thirty-one chip sequence. A zero bit of data is represented by inverting the pseudo-noise sequence.</p>
    <p num="p-0035">Spread spectrum techniques are also disclosed in the following patent applications and patent, which are incorporated herein by reference: U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/092,147; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/424,827, filed Apr. 19, 1995; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,121,407 to Partyka et al. They are also disclosed, for example, in “Spread Spectrum Systems,” by R. C. Dixon, published by John Wiley and Sons, Inc.</p>
    <p num="p-0036">The system disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/092,147 includes two receivers, a low power receiver for detecting a wake up signal from an interrogator, and a high power receiver for receiving commands from an interrogator. On the other hand, the integrated circuit <b>16</b> of the illustrated embodiment employs a single receiver for both wake up and receiving commands from an interrogator. Another difference is that in the system <b>12</b> of the illustrated embodiment the receiver, not the interrogator, controls wake up. In the system <b>24</b> of the illustrated embodiment, the integrated circuit <b>16</b> includes a timer that causes the receiver and support circuitry to be powered on periodically. This is described in greater detail elsewhere.</p>
    <p num="h-0015">Backscatter and Frequency Hopping</p>
    <p num="p-0037">The interrogator sends out a command that is spread around a certain center frequency (e.g, 2.44 GHz). After the interrogator transmits the command, and is expecting a response, the interrogator switches to a CW mode (continuous wave mode). In the continuous wave mode, the interrogator does not transmit any information. Instead, the interrogator just transmits 2.44 GHz radiation. In other words, the signal transmitted by the interrogator is not modulated. After the device <b>12</b> receives the command from the interrogator, the device <b>12</b> processes the command. If the device <b>12</b> is in a backscatter mode it alternately reflects or does not reflect the signal from the interrogator to send its reply. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, two halves of a dipole antenna are either shorted together or isolated from each other, as described below in greater detail. In the illustrated embodiment, frequency hopping does not occur when the interrogator transmits a command, but occurs when the interrogator is in the continuous wave mode. The interrogator, in the continuous wave mode, hops between various frequencies close to the 2.44 GHz frequency. These various frequencies are sufficiently close to the 2.44 GHz frequency that backscatter antenna reflection characteristics of the device <b>12</b> are not appreciably altered. Because the interrogator is hopping between frequencies, the interrogator knows what frequency backscatter reflections to expect back from the device <b>12</b>. By hopping between various frequencies, the amount of time the interrogator continuously uses a single frequency is reduced. This is advantageous in view of FCC regulatory requirements.</p>
    <p num="p-0038">In the illustrated embodiment, no attempt is made to frequency hop at the interrogator to a pseudo-random sequence and then correlate to that at the receiver. However, in alternative embodiments, such correlation takes place.</p>
    <p num="h-0016">CMOS Process</p>
    <p num="p-0039">The integrated circuit <b>16</b> is formed according to semiconductor wafer processing steps, such as CMOS semiconductor wafer processing steps used to form static random access memories. In the preferred embodiment, the integrated circuit <b>16</b> is a single metal integrated circuit. In other words, the integrated circuit <b>16</b> is formed using a single metal layer processing method. More particularly, only one layer of metal (e.g., aluminum) is employed. This is advantageous in that it results in a lower cost of production.</p>
    <p num="p-0040">In this processing method, a p-type wafer is employed. The processing method employed provides n-well areas used to define p-channel transistors; an active area which is used to define p+ and n+ diffused regions inside the p-type wafer or inside the n-well areas. Next, a layer is provided that helps prevent leakage between adjacent devices. Then, transistor are defined by forming n-type and p-type polysilicon. Then, a contact layer is defined for connecting desired intersections of polysilicon with metal (aluminum) that is subsequently formed. The contact layer is also used, in some instances, for connecting desired intersections of the metal that is subsequently formed with active area. Then the metal layer is formed. The contact layer provides a means for connecting metal with layers below the metal. Then, a passivation step is performed. Passivation means that the die is covered with a protective layer and holes are cut around the edge of the die so that electrical connection can be made to the bond pads.</p>
    <p num="p-0041">In some processing, after the metal layer is formed, an insulating layer is provided, and another layer of aluminum is formed above the insulating layer. Holes are provided at selected locations to interconnect the top layer of aluminum with lower layers. An advantage of using multiple layers of metal is that it provides greater flexibility in how functional blocks are laid out and in how power is bused to various areas. However, multiple metal layers add processing steps. This results in added cost and complexity.</p>
    <p num="p-0042">The process of the preferred embodiment employs only one layer of metal, and is therefore a relatively simple, inexpensive process.</p>
    <p num="p-0043">The following U.S. patents, which are incorporated herein by reference, disclose CMOS processing techniques that are employed in various alternative embodiments of the invention: U.S. Pat. No. 5,489,546 to Ahmad et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,272,367 to Dennison et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,134,085 to Gilgen et al.</p>
    <p num="p-0044">Various other processing methods can be employed in alternative embodiments.</p>
    <p num="h-0017">Transmitter and Receiver</p>
    <p num="p-0045">The receiver <b>30</b> is a radio frequency receiver included in the integrated circuit <b>16</b>, and the transmitter <b>32</b> is a radio frequency transmitter included in the integrated circuit <b>16</b>. In one embodiment, the receiver <b>30</b> includes a Schottky diode detector. Various forms of Schottky diode detectors are described in a paper titled “Designing Detectors for RF/ID Tags,” by Raymond W Waugh of Hewlett-Packard Company, submitted for presentation at the RF Expo, San Diego, Feb. 1, 1995, and incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <p num="p-0046">The receiver <b>30</b> of the illustrated embodiment makes use of the rate or frequency of data included in incoming signals, but does not make use of the carrier frequency of the incoming signal. In other words, operation of the receiver <b>30</b> is independent of the frequency of the carrier of the incoming signal over a wide range of carrier frequencies.</p>
    <p num="p-0047">Therefore, the device <b>12</b> can operate over a wide range of carrier frequencies. For example, the device <b>12</b> can operate with carriers of 915-5800 MHZ. In a more particular embodiment, the device <b>12</b> can operate with carrier frequencies in the 915, 2450, or 5800 MHZ bands. In the illustrated embodiment, the antennas are half wave antennas, and frequency selectivity of the device <b>12</b> is achieved based on selection of the antenna external to the integrated circuit <b>16</b>. Capacitors employed in the Schottky diode detector are also selected based on the carrier frequency that will be employed.</p>
    <p num="p-0048">In one embodiment, the transmitter <b>32</b> is switchable between operating in a modulated backscatter transmitter mode, and operating in an active mode. The transmitter <b>32</b> switches between the backscatter mode and the active mode in response to a radio frequency command, instructing the transmitter to switch, sent by the interrogator <b>26</b> and received by the receiver <b>30</b>. In the active mode, a carrier for the transmitter is extracted from a signal received by the receiver <b>30</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0049">Active transmitters are known in the art. See, for example, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/281,384. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/281,384 also discloses how transmit frequency for the transmitter <b>32</b> is recovered from a message received via radio frequency from the interrogator <b>26</b>. The device <b>12</b> differs from the device disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/281,384 in that a VCO control voltage is stored as an analog voltage level on a capacitor instead of as a digital number in a register. Further, in the illustrated embodiment, the recovered frequency is also used by the integrated circuit <b>16</b> to generate a DPSK subcarrier for modulated backscatter transmission.</p>
    <p num="p-0050">The transmitter is capable of transmitting using different modulation schemes, and the modulation scheme is selectable by the interrogator. More particularly, if it is desired to change the modulation scheme, the interrogator sends an appropriate command via radio frequency. The transmitter can switch between multiple available modulation schemes such as Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK), Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum, On-Off Keying (OOK), and Modulated Backscatter (MBS).</p>
    <p num="h-0018">Wake Up Timer and Logic Circuit</p>
    <p num="p-0051">The integrated circuit <b>16</b> includes the wake up timer and logic circuit <b>36</b> for conserving battery power. More particularly, the integrated circuit <b>16</b> normally operates in a sleep mode wherein most circuitry is inactive and there is a very low current draw on the battery <b>18</b>. One circuit that is active during the sleep mode is a timer for waking up the integrated circuit at predetermined intervals. In the illustrated embodiment, the interval is 16 milliseconds; however, various other intervals can be selected by radio frequency by sending a message from the interrogator <b>26</b> to the device <b>12</b>. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the interval is selectable as being 0.5, 16, 64 or 256 milliseconds.</p>
    <p num="p-0052">Assuming the selected interval is 16 milliseconds, after every sleep period of 16 milliseconds the wake up timer and logic circuit <b>36</b> activates the receiver <b>30</b>, the clock recovery and data recovery circuit <b>38</b>, and all the bias currents and voltages associated with the receiver <b>30</b>. This is a receiver on mode, illustrated by a vertical line marked WAKEUP RX ON in FIG. 27. Such bias currents and voltages are generated by the bias voltage and current generator <b>42</b>. The receiver <b>30</b> then determines if there is a radio frequency signal present.</p>
    <p num="p-0053">If there is no radio frequency signal present, the wake up timer and logic circuit <b>36</b> deactivates the receiver <b>30</b> and clock recovery and data recovery circuit <b>38</b>. The receiver then goes back to sleep in the low current mode until another 16 milliseconds pass (or whatever sleep period is selected).</p>
    <p num="p-0054">If there is a radio frequency signal present, the receiver will unspread the spread spectrum signal for processing. It is possible that while the receiver is on, it may detect a radio frequency signal from a source other than the interrogator <b>26</b>. For example, other radio frequency transmitting devices may be operating in the area. In the illustrated embodiment, the receiver is set to receive microwave frequency signals, so that a small antenna can be used. Therefore, the wake up timer and logic circuit <b>36</b> performs tests to determine if a radio frequency signal received on wake up is valid. This is a wake up abort test mode, illustrated by a vertical line marked WAKEUP ABORT TESTS in FIG. 27. If the wake up timer and logic circuit <b>36</b> determines that the incoming signal is not valid, the integrated circuit <b>16</b> returns to the sleep mode. The illustrated integrated circuit <b>16</b> consumes approximately one micro amp in the sleep mode, and the battery <b>18</b> is expected to last up to 10 years with a current drain of that order, depending on how often radio frequency signals are present and on the capacity of the battery.</p>
    <p num="p-0055">If a radio frequency signal is detected upon wake up, the wake up timer and logic compares the incoming signal to known characteristics of expected spread spectrum encoded data. In the illustrated embodiment, a valid incoming radio frequency signal will be a spread spectrum signal having a thirty-one chip code representing a single data bit. To represent a digital one (“1”) the thirty-one chip code is sent as is. To represent a digital zero (“0”) the thirty-one chip code is inverted. The wake up timer and logic circuit <b>36</b> knows how many transitions there are in a valid thirty-one chip sequence, and knows the time period within which all those transitions are expected (or the frequency of the transitions). After the incoming radio frequency signal is amplified and converted to baseband, it is tested against known characteristics of a valid signal.</p>
    <p num="p-0056">If the incoming signal does not pass these tests, the integrated circuit <b>16</b> returns to the sleep mode. If the incoming signal does pass these tests, then the wake up timer and logic circuit determines whether the clock recovery and data recovery circuit <b>38</b> locks on to the clock frequency contained in the chip rate of the incoming signal within a predetermined time period. If frequency lock is obtained, the microprocessor is turned on for processing of the received command. this is a processor on mode illustrated by a vertical line marked “PROCESSOR ON” in FIG. 27.</p>
    <p num="p-0057">If frequency lock is not obtained within the predetermined time, the integrated circuit <b>16</b> returns to the sleep mode.</p>
    <p num="p-0058">Other appropriate tests can be performed in embodiments where spread spectrum is not employed. In these embodiments, knowing how valid data is encoded, the wake up timer and logic still compares the number of transitions received in a given amount of time with an expected number of transitions for a valid signal.</p>
    <p num="p-0059">In summary, various tests are performed, and the order in which they are performed is preferably selected to most quickly identify invalid signals. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/424,827, filed Apr. 19, 1995 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/092,147, which are incorporated herein by reference, disclose tests that could be employed in various alternative embodiments of the invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0060">After the wake up timer and logic circuit <b>36</b> determines that a received signal is valid, the integrated circuit <b>16</b> then performs clock recovery. To save space and cost, the preferred device <b>12</b> does not include a crystal timing element (clock). Instead, all timing for the device <b>12</b> is extracted from valid incoming signals received by the receiver <b>30</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0061">In one embodiment, a valid incoming radio frequency signal is digital, and starts with a preamble, which is followed by a start code (or Barker code), which is followed by data (e.g., a command). For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the preamble is a long (e.g., eighteen milliseconds) string of zeros; i.e., the thirty-one chip sequence is inverted, and sent repeatedly for approximately 18 milliseconds. In the illustrated embodiment the data or command after the Barker code is shorter than the preamble, and is approximately 4 milliseconds long.</p>
    <p num="h-0019">Clock Recovery and Data Recovery Circuit</p>
    <p num="p-0062">The clock for the entire integrated circuit <b>16</b> is extracted from the incoming message itself. In one embodiment, the transmitter <b>32</b> is selectable as being operable in an active transmission mode, or a backscatter mode. If the transmitter <b>32</b> is operating in an active mode, the extracted clock is multiplied up to the carrier frequency of the transmitter <b>32</b>. For example, in one embodiment, the transmitter carrier frequency is 2.44 GHz. The choice of chip rate is a function of the carrier frequency and the carrier frequency has to be divisible by a power of two to give the chip rate on the input.</p>
    <p num="p-0063">If the transmitter <b>32</b> is operating in a backscatter mode, the clock that has been recovered from the incoming signal received by the receiver <b>30</b> is divided to make it slower and is then used for frequency shift key or phase shift key modulated backscatter.</p>
    <p num="p-0064">In summary, a clock is recovered from the incoming message, and used for timing for the micro controller <b>34</b> and all the other clock circuitry on the chip, and also for deriving the transmitter carrier or the subcarrier, depending on whether the transmitter is operating in active mode or backscatter mode.</p>
    <p num="p-0065">Note that there are disadvantages to generating a transmit frequency in this fashion. In an alternative embodiment (not shown), a crystal is employed to generate a clock. A crystal provides a more stable, reliable clock to generate the transmit frequency, but also increases cost and size of the device <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0066">In addition to recovering a clock, the clock recovery and data recovery circuit <b>38</b> also performs data recovery on valid incoming signals. The valid spread spectrum incoming signal is passed through the spread spectrum processing circuit <b>40</b>, and the spread spectrum processing circuit <b>40</b> extracts the actual ones and zeros of data from the incoming signal. More particularly, the spread spectrum processing circuit <b>40</b> takes the chips from the spread spectrum signal, and reduces each thirty-one chip section down to a bit of one or zero, which is passed to the micro controller <b>34</b>.</p>
    <p num="h-0020">Micro Controller</p>
    <p num="p-0067">The micro controller <b>34</b> includes a serial processor, or I/O facility that received the bits from the spread spectrum processing circuit <b>40</b>. The micro controller <b>34</b> performs further error correction. More particularly, a modified hamming code is employed, where each eight bits of data is accompanied by five check bits used by the micro controller <b>34</b> for error correction. The micro controller <b>34</b> further includes a memory, and after performing the data correction, the micro controller <b>34</b> stores bytes of the data bits in memory. These bytes contain a command sent by the interrogator <b>26</b>. The micro controller <b>34</b> responds to the command.</p>
    <p num="p-0068">For example, the interrogator <b>26</b> may send a command requesting that any device <b>12</b> in the field respond with the device's identification number. Status information is also returned to the interrogator <b>26</b> from the device <b>12</b> when the device <b>12</b> responds.</p>
    <p num="h-0021">Unalterable Identification</p>
    <p num="p-0069">In one embodiment, the integrated circuit <b>16</b> includes unalterable indicia (a signature), different from the device's identification number discussed above. The unalterable indicia is burned into programmable read only memory or formed using a laser operating on fusible links. The unalterable indicia is indicative of the history of the particular die used to manufacture the integrated circuit <b>16</b>. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the unalterable indicia includes a lot number, wafer number, and die number of the die used to manufacture the integrated circuit <b>16</b>. This information is transmitted by the transmitter in response to a manufacturer's command received by the receiver. In one embodiment, the manufacturer's command is a controlled access, or secret command that is not readily ascertainable by the public or purchaser/user of the device. This unalterable indicia can be used to trace manufacturing problems in defective devices <b>12</b>, or to locate stolen products carrying a device <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p num="h-0022">Arbitration</p>
    <p num="p-0070">If the interrogator <b>26</b> sends out a command requesting that all devices <b>12</b> within range identify themselves, and gets a large number of simultaneous replies, the interrogator <b>26</b> may not able to interpret any of these replies. Further, there may be multiple interrogators in an area trying to interrogate the same device <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0071">Therefore, arbitration schemes are provided. With the more common scenario of multiple devices <b>12</b> trying to respond to an interrogator, the interrogator <b>26</b> sends a command causing each device <b>12</b> of a potentially large number of responding devices <b>12</b> to select a random number from a known range and use it as that device's arbitration number. By transmitting requests for identification to various subsets of the full range of arbitration numbers, and checking for an error-free response, the interrogator <b>26</b> determines the arbitration number of every responder station capable of communicating at the same time. Therefore, the interrogator <b>26</b> is able to conduct subsequent uninterrupted communication with devices <b>12</b>, one at a time, by addressing only one device <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0072">If the interrogator <b>26</b> has prior knowledge of the identification number of a device <b>12</b> which the interrogator <b>26</b> is looking for, it can specify that a response is requested only from the device <b>12</b> with that identification number.</p>
    <p num="p-0073">Arbitration schemes are discussed below, in greater detail, in connection with protocols.</p>
    <p num="p-0074">U.S. Pat. No. 5,365,551 to Snodgrass et al., which is incorporated by reference, discloses arbitration schemes that could be employed in various alternative embodiments of the invention.</p>
    <p num="h-0023">Reply</p>
    <p num="p-0075">After the micro controller processes a command from the interrogator <b>26</b>, the micro controller formats the reply as specified in the protocol and the formatted reply leaves the micro controller via a serial data port of the micro controller. If desired, the formatted reply is spread spectrum encoded by the spread spectrum processing circuit <b>40</b>. The reply is then modulated by the transmitter <b>32</b>. The transmitter <b>32</b> is capable of transmitting using different modulation schemes, and the modulation scheme is selectable by the interrogator <b>26</b>. More particularly, if it is desired to change the modulation scheme, the interrogator <b>26</b> sends an appropriate command via radio frequency.</p>
    <p num="p-0076">The transmitted replies have a format similar to the format of incoming messages. More particularly, a reply starts with a preamble (e.g., all zeros in active mode, or alternating double zeros and double ones in backscatter mode), followed by a Barker or start code which is thirteen bits long, followed by actual data.</p>
    <p num="p-0077">No stop bits are included in the incoming message or reply, in the preferred embodiment. Instead, part of the incoming message describes how many bytes are included, so the integrated circuit <b>16</b> knows how much information is included. Similarly, part of the outgoing reply describes how many bytes are included, so the interrogator <b>12</b> knows how much information is included. The incoming message and outgoing reply preferably also include a check sum or redundancy code so that the integrated circuit <b>16</b> or the interrogator <b>12</b> can confirm receipt of the entire message or reply.</p>
    <p num="p-0078">After the reply is sent, the integrated circuit <b>16</b> returns to the sleep mode, and the wake up timer and logic circuit <b>36</b> starts timing again for the next wake up (e.g., in 16 milliseconds, or whatever period is selected).</p>

    <p num="p-0080">FIGS. 6AA-EK include circuitry partitioned in blocks in a manner that is somewhat different from the way the blocks are partitioned in FIG. 5. In some ways FIGS. 6AA-EK shows less detail than in FIG. 5, and in some ways they show more detail.</p>
    <p num="p-0081">The integrated circuit <b>16</b> is shown as including an analog processor “anlgproc,” an RF processor “rfproc,” a PN (pseudo random number) processor “pnproc,” a data processor “dataproc,” and return link configuration logic “rlconfig.”</p>
    <p num="p-0082">The data processor “dataproc” shown in FIGS. 6AA-EK is the micro controller or microprocessor <b>34</b> of FIG. 5. The data processor “dataproc” is shown in greater detail in FIG. 7. In the illustrated embodiment, the data processor “dataproc” is an eight bit processor, and includes a ROM “rom,” a RAM “ram,” a serial I/O block “sio,” an eight bit ALU (arithmetic logic unit) “alu,” an instruction decoder programmable logic array “insdec,” and address decoder “adrdec,” a clock generator “clk,” a conditional qualifier decoder “cqualdec,” a databus latch/precharge circuit “dblatch,” a timed lockout divider “tld,” a data interleaver (which interleaves two thirteen bit words) “dil,” a convolutional encoder and preamble generator “conv,” a digital port output controller “doutport,” a shift register input data multiplexer “shdel” and a series of registers. In the illustrated embodiment, the registers include a timed lockout register “tloreg,” a plurality of status registers “sreg,” a plurality of read/write control registers “oreg,” and an instruction register “insreg.”</p>
    <p num="p-0083">The registers are used to drive control lines to various different circuits to allow the data processor to have control over those circuits. The “sio” block (described below) is the data path for data received and for the data to be transmitted.</p>
    <p num="p-0084">FIG. 6.01 is a layout diagram illustrating the physical layout of various components on an integrated circuit die, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. The physical locations and sizes of components relative to other components are shown. Boundaries between various blocks may be approximate in the sense that portions of certain blocks may extend into other blocks. The layout diagram illustrates that separate analog and digital ground returns are provided. In the illustrated embodiment, the ground return for the receiver and transmitter is spaced apart from the receiver and transmitter. However, in an alternative embodiment, locating the ground return for the receiver and transmitter proximate the receiver and transmitter may provide improved results. In the preferred embodiment, the transmitter and receiver circuitry is physically located on the die close to an edge, proximate to the bond pads. More particularly, the microwave outputs of the transmitter <b>32</b> are arranged on the die so as to be next to (in close physical proximity to) the appropriate bond pads. Also shown in FIG. 6.01 are small squares adjacent the receiver and active transmitter pads, respectively. These are ground pads for microwave probing, in the exemplary embodiment. In an alternative embodiment, these microwave probing ground pads can be employed as functional ground pads instead of using the illustrated common analog ground pad.</p>
    <p num="p-0085">FIG. 7.01AA-BB provide a circuit drawing of a processor clock generator “clk.” The processor clock generator provides clock circuitry that generates all the various clocks that are used by the processor.</p>
    <p num="p-0086">FIGS. 7.0101AA-BB provide a circuit drawing of a processor clock controller “clkctl.” The clock controller “clkctl” determines when the clocks are running. As described elsewhere, the processor is not always on. The clock controller uses enabling signals from wake up so that it knows when to turn on. Thus, some of the inputs to the clock controller are power wake up, receive wake up, timer wake up. The clock controller also synchronizes shut down of the clocks when the processor has completed its task.</p>
    <p num="p-0087">FIGS. 7.0102AE-DJ provide a circuit drawing of a processor phase generator “clkph.” The processor phase generator “clkph” generates master clocks—phase one “PH<b>1</b>” and phase two “PH<b>2</b>”—which are non-overlapping clocks.</p>
    <p num="p-0088">FIGS. 7.0103AA-BD provide a circuit drawing of a clock state generator “clkst.” The clock state generator “clkst” generates some derivative clocks. Processor instruction cycles are divided. There are cycles and there are states. Within each cycle, which is a certain time period, there are four states—S<b>1</b> through S<b>4</b>. The states are all non-overlapping, and each state has a high time that is one quarter of the cycle time. As a processor instruction executes, the instruction is taken from the rom “rom,” and loaded into the instruction register. The instruction can be, for example, a 1, 2 or 3 cycle instruction, depending on how complex the function is that is performed by that instruction. These are micro instructions for running the processor on chip. They should not be confused with the commands that are sent by radio frequency, which are a much higher level commands. The commands sent by radio frequency require many of these micro instructions for the processor to carry them out. During clock cycle one, line C<b>1</b> in FIGS. 7.0103AA-BD is high, during clock cycle two, line C<b>2</b> is high, etc. Within each one of those clock cycles, state one is high for a certain time period and then goes low, and state two goes high for a certain time period then goes low, and so on up through state four. Within each of these states, there is one phase one high time, and one phase two high time.</p>
    <p num="p-0089">FIGS. 7.02AA-BF provide a circuit drawing of an address decoder “adrdec.” In executing instructions, the processor has the need to move bytes of data between registers and ram “ram” and possibly to the serial IO controller “sio.” The address decoder “adrdec” generates enable lines to those various different blocks (the registers, ram, and sio, as appropriate) when their address appears on the address bus. The primary input to the address decoder is the address bus. This decoder decides which circuit block is being addressed and issues an enable for either a write or a read, whichever is appropriate, to that particular block.</p>
    <p num="p-0090">FIGS. 7.03AA-EH provide a circuit drawing of random access memory “ram.” The ram has 512 bytes of storage available. 256 of those bytes are available to the user of the device <b>12</b>, and the other 256 bites are used to do calculations required by the processor. Most of the drawing is taken up by blocks of RAM arrays “ram8×4.”</p>
    <p num="p-0091">FIGS. 7.0301AA-BB provide a circuit drawing of a ram control circuit “ramctl.” The ram control circuit issues word line select enable signals, a read command, a write command, and some precharge signals. The ram control circuit generates the signals to control access to and from the random access memory “ram.”</p>
    <p num="p-0092">FIGS. 7.0302AA-AC provide a circuit drawing of a RAM array “ram 8×4.” Each RAM array is made up of four rows and eight columns of RAM cells.</p>
    <p num="p-0093">FIG. 7.030201 provides a circuit drawing of a single RAM cell. In the illustrated embodiment, the RAM cell is a six transistor RAM cell. Four transistor RAM cells are employed in alternative embodiments.</p>
    <p num="p-0094">FIGS. 7.0303AA-AD provide a circuit drawing of a RAM precharge circuit “rampch.” FIGS. 7.0304AA-AD provide a circuit drawing of a RAM precharge circuit “ramdch.” In the illustrated embodiment, this circuit has been disabled as is shown in the figure. The RAM precharge circuits provides precharge signals to speed up writing to and reading from RAM cells.</p>
    <p num="p-0095">FIG. 7.0305 provides a circuit drawing of a RAM address buffer “ramadb.” The RAM address buffer isolates the capacitive load presented by the RAM circuits from the address bus.</p>
    <p num="p-0096">FIGS. 7.0306AA-BA provide a circuit drawing of a RAM word line driver “ramwdr.” The RAM wordline driver is a predecoder. It takes two address inputs and generates four possible select lines “P<b>0</b>-P<b>3</b>” which are used in a row decoder (discussed below) for the RAM.</p>
    <p num="p-0097">FIGS. 7.0307AA-BB provide a circuit drawing of a RAM word line decoder “ramwdec.” The RAM word line decoder receives the select lines from the RAM wordline driver in conjunction with four other addresses “AD<b>0</b>-AD<b>3</b>” to select a unique word line. A word line is a row of RAM cells within the RAM.</p>
    <p num="p-0098">FIGS. 7.0308AA-BB provide a circuit drawing of a RAM column select decode circuit “ramedec.” The RAM column select decode circuit uses three address lines “AD<b>5</b>-AD<b>7</b>” to generate eight select lines “CSEL<b>0</b>-CSEL<b>7</b>.”</p>
    <p num="p-0099">FIGS. 7.0309AA-BG provide a circuit drawing of a RAM column selector multiplexor “ramcsel.” The RAM column selector multiplexor uses the output select lines “CSEL<b>0</b>-CSEL<b>7</b>” from the RAM column select decode circuit “ramcdec” to connect one pair of bit or column lines out of eight pairs “BIT<b>0</b>N/P”-“BIT<b>7</b>N/P” onto a bus. The bus goes to a sense amp or to a write driver, depending on whether a RAM cell is being read or written. There are eight of these RAM column selectors side by side, functioning in the same manner. With any one selection, one of eight pairs are selected on FIGS. 7.0309AA-BG, but there are seven more similar selections taking place so an entire byte of RAM is selected at one time.</p>
    <p num="p-0100">FIGS. 7.0310AA-BB provide a circuit drawing of a RAM databus interface “ramdb.” The RAM databus interface includes a sense amp and write driver for the RAM. The RAM databus interface receives the output/input lines “BIT<b>0</b>N/P”-“BIT<b>7</b>N/P” from the RAM column selector “ramcsel.” Selected RAM cells can either be sensed or written.</p>
    <p num="p-0101">FIGS. 7.04AA-HJ provide a circuit drawing of a ROM “from.” The ROM has 4096 bytes of contact programmable memory. ROMs of multiple integrated circuits <b>16</b> are simultaneously mass programmed. In the third to the last mask step, each particular cell of ROM is programmed with a zero or a one. The ROM does not include the information about the lot number, wafer number and die number discussed elsewhere herein. The ROM is programmed at the time of manufacture, whereas the information about the lot number and wafer number and die location is stored after the manufacture of the wafer using an electrically programmable or laser fuse programmable, or electrical fuse programmable structure.</p>
    <p num="p-0102">FIGS. 7.0401AA-BB provide a circuit drawing of a ROM control logic circuit “romctl.” The ROM control logic circuit provides signals to allow the contents of eight memory cells of the ROM, one byte to be read out at a time.</p>
    <p num="p-0103">FIGS. 7.0402AA-AB provide a circuit drawing of a ROM bit line precharge circuit “ROMPCH.” The ROM bit line precharge circuit precharges bit lines of the ROM. Bit lines are the vertical lines in the array of ROM cells on which the voltage that is sensed appears after selected ROM cells are accessed.</p>
    <p num="p-0104">FIGS. 7.0403AA-BB provide a circuit drawing of a ROM word line driver “romwdr.” The ROM word line driver (or row driver) takes address inputs “A<b>7</b>-A<b>9</b>” and generates enable signals “WDR<b>0</b>-WDR<b>7</b>” to select row lines of the ROM.</p>
    <p num="p-0105">FIGS. 7.0404AA-DC provide a circuit drawing of a ROM word block decoder “romwdec_rev.” The ROM word block decoder has as inputs the enable signals “WDR<b>0</b>-WDR<b>7</b>” from the ROM word line driver “romwdr” plus other addresses to generate actual word line signals themselves. A word line signal selects a row of ROM cells.</p>
    <p num="p-0106">FIGS. 7.0405AA-BA provide a circuit drawing of a ROM bit line address driver “rombldr.” The ROM bit line address driver buffers some of the addresses so they are capable of driving a large decoder structure “rombldec” (described below).</p>
    <p num="p-0107">FIGS. 7.0406AA-CK provide a circuit drawing of a ROM bit line decoder “rombldec.” The ROM bit line decoder provides a decoder structure for selecting a particular ROM bit line out of thirty-two bit lines. There are eight such “rombldec” circuits, allowing simultaneous selection of eight bit lines.</p>
    <p num="p-0108">FIGS. 7.0407AA-AB provide a circuit drawing of a ROM sense amplifier “romsns.” The ROM sense amplifier is the sense amp used for determining the state of a particular ROM bit being accessed. Eight ROM bit sense amplifiers are used.</p>
    <p num="p-0109">FIGS. 7.05AA-CB provide a circuit drawing of an instruction register “insreg.” The code or program that controls the operation of the processor is stored in the ROM. The instructions stored in the ROM are transferred one at a time to this instruction register “insreg” so that they can be interpreted and the processor can carry out the operations required by that instruction. After the integrated circuit wakes up, its operation is controlled by the wake up and clock recovery circuits. After the integrated circuit locks on to the clock and a valid start (Barker) code is received, the processor turns on and the program stored in the ROM takes over from that point. The program performs functions such as determining if the integrated circuit <b>16</b> is in a power up cycle. If the device <b>12</b> is in a power up cycle, the processor performs various tasks relevant to power up. If the integrated circuit <b>16</b> is receiving a command from an interrogator, the program will determine which command and then go through a sequence of required steps in order to respond appropriately to that command. Then the program allows the integrated circuit <b>16</b> to go back to sleep.</p>
    <p num="p-0110">FIGS. 7.0501AA-BB provide a circuit drawing of an instruction register “insrcel” included in the instruction register “insreg.”</p>
    <p num="p-0111">FIGS. 7.06AA-CN provide a circuit drawing of an instruction decoder PLA “insdec.” The instruction decoder PLA interprets what is in the instruction register “insreg” and issues all the enable signals necessary to effect performance of the functions called for in that instruction. Details of the instruction decoder PLA are shown in FIGS. 7.0601AA-HI; 7.0602AA-JH; 7.0603AA-JI; and 7.0604AA-JI.</p>

    <p num="p-0116">FIG. 7.060401 provides a circuit drawing of an instruction decoder ROM amp “insramp” included in the circuit of FIGS. 7.0604AA-JI, 7.0601AA-HI, 7.0602AA-JH, and 7.0603AA-JI.</p>
    <p num="p-0117">FIG. 7.060402 is a circuit drawing of an instruction decoder PLA amp “inspamp” included in the circuit of FIGS. 7.0604AA-JI, 7.0601AA-HI, 7.0602AA-JH, and 7.0603AA-JI.</p>
    <p num="p-0118">FIG. 7.060403 is a circuit drawing of an instruction decoder PLA latch “insplat” included in the circuit of FIGS. 7.0604AA-JI, 7.0601AA-HI, 7.0602AA-JH, and 7.0603AA-JI.</p>
    <p num="p-0119">FIGS. 7.07AA-BB provide a circuit drawing of a conditional qualifier decoder “cqualdec.” Certain instructions behave differently depending on certain conditions (e.g., whether a carry bit is set), and the conditional qualifier decoder looks for these conditions.</p>
    <p num="p-0120">FIGS. 7.08AA-CA provide a circuit drawing of a databus latch and precharge circuit “dblatch.” Data is bused around in eight bit bytes, and the databus latch and precharge circuit drives the databus. The data bus is in a precharge high state when the data bus is not being used. Whichever source of data is selected to put its information on the bus will then drive selected bits low if appropriate.</p>
    <p num="p-0121">FIGS. 7.09AA-BF provide a circuit drawing of an arithmetic logic unit “alu.” The arithmetic logic unit “alu” is a basic arithmetic logic unit that provides enough flexibility to perform the functions that are needed for the RFID task. Details of the arithmetic logic unit are provided in drawings below.</p>

The data on which arithmetic or logical operations are to be performed reside typically in the A cell “aluacell” or the B cell “alubcell.” The registers further include a program counter “atupc,” a stack pointer “alurcell,” a data pointer “alurcell,” and a memory address register “alumar” that provides for indirect addressing. The ALU bit “alubit<b>1</b>” further includes an adder “aluadd” and a slave register “aluslave” to the adder.</p>

    <p num="h-0025">Details of Low Power Dormant Mode</p>
    <p num="p-0135">It is sometimes desirable to prevent the integrated circuit <b>16</b> from responding to commands from an interrogator. For example, after communication with a particular device <b>12</b>, it is sometimes desirable to prevent that particular device <b>12</b> from responding to a subsequent interrogation that is intended for a different device <b>12</b>. If, for example, the device <b>12</b> is used in connection with an access gate, after an interrogator has read a badge containing the device <b>12</b> as a controlled access point is passed, the interrogator no longer has a need to communicate with that badge. The interrogator instead would want to pick up subsequent badges passing through the access gate. In addition, when the interrogator no longer has a need to communicate with a particular device <b>12</b>, it is desirable that the device <b>12</b> stay in the sleep mode to conserve battery power.</p>
    <p num="p-0136">In one embodiment, the device <b>12</b> is put into an unresponsive state by using a counter which is set to a desired time via a radio frequency command. The device will then not respond to Identify commands (described below in greater detail) used by an interrogator to request information from a device <b>12</b>. In this embodiment, the unresponsive state can be cancelled by a radio frequency command. However, this embodiment is disadvantageous in that the device must wake up to process incoming commands and abort if the command is an Identify command. This consumes battery capacity.</p>
    <p num="p-0137">In a preferred embodiment, the device <b>12</b> can be placed in a dormant mode via a radio frequency command. The dormant mode cannot be cancelled. When in the dormant mode, the device <b>12</b> does not wake up to look for incoming commands.</p>
    <p num="p-0138">FIGS. 7.10AA-CC provide a circuit drawing of a timed lock out divider “tld.” The timed lock out divider takes as an input the low power clock which is the same clock that sets the wake up interval for the integrated circuit <b>16</b>. The timed lock out divider provides two functions. The timed lockout divider provides an alarm timer function, and provides a timed lockout function which is used for the dormant mode function and for the timed lockout of Identify commands.</p>
    <p num="p-0139">The alarm timer is set to go off in intervals, such as about every one minute. As an alarm timer, the timed lock out divider causes the integrated circuit <b>16</b> to wake up and check for threshold violations in alarm mode. Such threshold violations would be triggered by analog sensors such as temperature sensors, magnetic sensors, etc.</p>
    <p num="p-0140">The timed lock out divider also allows, by RF command from an interrogator, a user to disable a device <b>12</b> to make it not respond for a prescribed period of time (i.e., allows the user to place the device <b>12</b> in the dormant mode). The prescribed period of time can be set in various increments. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the increments are one second increments from one up to 255 seconds.</p>
    <p num="p-0141">When in the dormant mode, the device <b>12</b> does not periodically switch to the receiver on mode to check for the presence of radio frequency commands. Therefore, power is conserved.</p>
    <p num="p-0142">This dormant mode function is useful for the same reasons that the cancelable timed disabling is useful. If, for example, the device <b>12</b> is used in connection with an access gate, after an interrogator has read a badge containing the device <b>12</b> as a controlled access point is passed, the interrogator no longer has a need to communicate with that badge. The interrogator instead would want to pick up subsequent badges. Therefore, the interrogator can instruct the device <b>12</b> to not respond for a certain time, so as to prevent an unwanted response of a device <b>12</b>, after having communicated with that device <b>12</b>, but with increased power savings over the cancelable timed disabling. Because wake ups are disabled, current consumed by the device <b>12</b> is very low; e.g., 1 μA.</p>
    <p num="p-0143">FIG. 7.1001 provides a circuit drawing showing details of construction of a timed lock out divider cell “tldcel” included in the timed lockout divider “tld.”</p>
    <p num="p-0144">FIGS. 7.11AA-AB provide a circuit drawing of a timed lock out register “tloreg.” This register acts as a down counter and is selectively set with the desired lockout time, from 1 to 255 seconds.</p>
    <p num="p-0145">FIGS. 7.1101AA-AC provide a circuit drawing of a timed lock out register cell “tlorcel” included in the timed lockout register.</p>
    <p num="p-0146">FIGS. 7.12AA-AC provide a circuit drawing of an read/write control register or output register “oreg.” There are a number of these output registers. The output registers allow the processor to send control signals out to various peripheral circuits to cause them to function when required.</p>
    <p num="p-0147">FIG. 7.1201 provides construction details of a control register cell “regcell” included in the output register “oreg.”</p>
    <p num="p-0148">FIGS. 7.13AA-BA provide a circuit drawing of a status register “sreg.” The processor uses the status register to monitor the status of lines supplied from various blocks of circuitry.</p>
    <p num="p-0149">FIGS. 7.1301AA-AB provide a circuit drawing of a status register cell “sregcel” included in the status register.</p>
    <p num="p-0150">FIGS. 7.14AA-AB provide a circuit drawing of a serial input output block “sio.” The serial input output circuitry is the data path for data received and for the data to be transmitted. This circuit controls the transfer of the serial stream of data received from the receiver into the processor. The circuit also controls the transfer of the transmit serial data stream from the processor out to the transmitter. The serial input output circuitry comprises two blocks: a block “siodata” that processes data, and a controller “sioctl” that runs the block that processes data.</p>
    <p num="p-0151">FIGS. 7.1401AA-AB provide a circuit drawing of a serial input output data path “siodata.” When the integrated circuit <b>16</b> is in a transmit mode, data enters the bit registers “sioreg” from the top of the figure, and the data is transferred down to the registers “siobdlat” and “siobdlat_inv” which are the row of blocks second up from the bottom of the figure. The intermediate stages “sioxor” are all exclusive or gates that are used to generate check bits according to the previously mentioned modified Hamming code. The extra five bits “P<b>0</b>-P<b>4</b>” appended to the eight data bits “D<b>0</b>-D<b>7</b>” are generated by the exclusive-or gates, and then all thirteen bits are transferred to the registers “sioshr” which are the row of blocks at the bottom of the figure. The thirteen bits are serially shifted out to the right of the figure.</p>
    <p num="p-0152">When the integrated circuit <b>16</b> is in a receive mode, a reverse sequence takes place. Data is shifted into the thirteen bit registers “sioshr” shown on the bottom of the figure, then transferred up to the registers “siodblat” immediately above the shift registers “sioshr” in the figure. Then the exclusive or circuitry “sioxor” uses the data and the check bits to determine whether there are any errors. If there are any correctable errors, they are corrected at that point. The serial input output data path “siodata” can also detect double bit errors which are not correctable. If a double bit error is detected, a signal is provided at the upper left of the figure to the processor that an uncorrectable error has occurred. Assuming that there is no uncorrectable error, the eight corrected bits are now present as inputs to the top row of registers “sioreg.” The eight corrected bits are then transferred in to the top row of registers. From the top row of registers “sioreg,” the corrected bits are transferred in parallel to the processor.</p>

    <p num="p-0160">FIGS. 7.15AA-EC provide a circuit drawing of a data interleaver “dil.” In a number of modulation schemes used or selectively used by the integrated circuit 16, differential encoding is employed. Use of differential encoding in the integrated circuit 16 makes possible a simpler receiver in the interrogator. However, if an error occurs in the process of differential encoding, it necessarily corrupts two adjacent bits. The modified Hamming code cannot correct errors where two adjacent bits are in error. This problem is solved by interleaving two bytes. Bit by bit, the first bit of one byte is shuffled next to the first bit of another byte and so on through all thirteen bits. This way, when differential encoding is performed, which may possibly create two adjacent errors, the two bytes are deinterleaved and separated at the receiver so that the bytes are in separate error corrective words. The errors can then be fixed.</p>
    <p num="p-0161">The data interleaver works by shifting data in from a data input “SIOTXD” (on the upper left of FIGS. 7.15AA-EC).

Thus, a new interleave order is generated on transfer from the registers “dil_sreg” to the registers “dil_plsreg.” Then, the contents of the registers “dil_plsreg” are shifted out (to the right in the view of FIGS. 7.15AA-EC) in a serial, bit by bit fashion, through line “DILTXD.”</p>

    <p num="h-0027">Overview</p>
    <p num="p-0175">For purposes of realizing a cost effective and low power radio frequency receiver on an RFID tag, a simple Schottky diode receiver is utilized. The receiver is formed from a Schottky diode detector, an amplifier, and the receiving antenna “rxantenna”. With the implementation of a single integrated circuit <b>16</b> RFID tag, an easy and low cost technique for configuring the frequency of operation on a tag is needed. Receiver frequency characteristics can be tailored by selecting an appropriately sized antenna to be coupled to the integrated circuit <b>16</b> that supports the Schottky diode detector. Furthermore, adjustment of bias current across the Schottky diode can be used to realize a desired resistance there across, enabling tuning or detuning of the receiver.</p>

Details of the actual circuit implementation on integrated circuit <b>16</b> (of FIG. 5) will be discussed below with reference to FIGS. 5, 8AA-CB, 8.01AA-DE, 8.0101AA-CB, 28, 29, and 30.</p>
    <p num="h-0028">Antenna Implementation</p>
    <p num="p-0182">Preferably, the antenna “rxantenna” is constructed and arranged to form a folded dipole antenna, consisting of a continuous conductive path, or loop of microstrip. The terminal ends of the antenna <b>44</b> loop each form a conductive lead that electrically interconnects with the integrated circuit <b>16</b> of FIG. 5. According to the actual circuit layout of FIG. 6,antenna “rxantenna” is connected to the integrated circuit <b>16</b> via the exposed conductive bonding pad labeled “rxantenna—Pad D”. Alternatively, the antenna can be constructed as a continuous loop antenna. In this case, the antenna is constructed from a continuous piece of conductive microstrip configured in the shape of a square or circle to form a loop antenna.</p>
    <p num="p-0183">In assembly, antenna <b>44</b> (as well as antenna <b>46</b>) is depicted in electrically conductive and bonded relationship with “rxantenna—Pad D,” shown on the integrated circuit <b>16</b> of FIG. 6. Similarly, antenna <b>46</b> is bonded to “txantenna—Pad AA”. The preferred assembly technique, discussed below, involves a flip-chip epoxy bonding technique wherein the antennas <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> of FIG. 5 are actually printed onto the back face of the plastic card or carrier (e.g. card <b>11</b> of FIG. 2 and stamp <b>20</b> of FIG. 3), after which the integrated circuit <b>16</b> is bonded to the antenna, as well as to the battery, using a conductive epoxy.</p>
    <p num="p-0184">Preferably, the antennas <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> are printed onto the back side of the card or stamp, forming each microstrip loop antenna thereon. For example, the antenna can be silk screened onto the card with a conductive polymer thick film. Alternatively, a conductive silver filled epoxy can be used. Alternatively, the antenna can be formed from a separate piece of conductive material, for example, from a piece of wire or conductive ribbon that is glued to the back of the card.</p>
    <p num="p-0185">One exemplary technique for assembling the postage stamp <b>20</b> of FIG. 4 is provided here below. The same technique can be used to assemble the badge <b>10</b> of FIG. 2, or any other similarly constructed tag having a rigid support or substrate similar to plastic cards <b>11</b> and <b>21</b>. First, antennas <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> (of FIG. 5) are mounted to a back face of the card. Preferably, the above elements are simultaneously printed onto the back of a large sheet of plastic with a conductive silver printed thick film, after which the cards are individually separated, or cut from the sheet. Pads on the integrated circuit <b>16</b> form enlarged connection points for electrically bonding each antenna <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> to “rxantenna—Pad D” and “txantenna—Pad AA” of FIG. 6 and for connections to a power supply. Next, the card is positioned front face down onto a rigid support plate. Then integrated circuit <b>16</b> (of FIG. 4) is mounted to the pads with conductive beads of epoxy. Finally, the battery <b>18</b> is bonded along its bottom face with a bead of conductive epoxy, after which conductive epoxy is used to electrically connect the opposite terminal or top of the battery with a corresponding conductive die pad.</p>
    <p num="p-0186">Subsequently, a metal dam sized to conform generally to the outer peripheral shape of the card <b>20</b> is placed over the back of the card. The dam functions as an outer template while a thin layer of non-conductive epoxy (not shown) is applied to the back of the card <b>20</b>, preferably hermetically sealing in the integrated circuit <b>16</b>, antenna and battery. Preferably, the thin coat of epoxy consists of a coating, barely thick enough to cover over the components forming the device. One benefit provided by this construction technique is the elimination of any visible bumps in the tag which can result when constructing the tag by heat sealing two or more pieces of plastic card together to trap the device <b>12</b> therein. However, a lesser preferred construction of this invention envisions forming the tag, e.g. badge <b>10</b>, stamp <b>20</b>, or some other tag, with such a heat sealed sandwich of plastic cards.</p>
    <p num="p-0187">Preferably, the above technique for mounting integrated circuit <b>16</b> to card <b>20</b> (of FIG. 4) consists of a flip-chip mounting technique. One example of a flip-chip mounting technique is disclosed in pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/166,747, “Process of Manufacturing an Electrical Bonding Interconnect Having a Metal Bond Pad Portion and Having a Conductive Epoxy Portion Comprising an Oxide Reducing Agent,” listing Rick Lake and Mark E.

    <p num="h-0029">Integrated Circuit Implementation</p>
    <p num="p-0188">According to FIG. 8, the Schottky diode detector “diodet” is configured within receiver “rx” to receive radio frequency signals via receiving antenna “rxantenna”. One exemplary receiving antenna configuration is depicted in FIG. 5, denoted generally by reference numeral <b>44</b>. In operation, the Schottky diode detector and the receiving antenna cooperate to form a tunable receiving circuit. Signals detected by the Schottky diode detector are input to a five stage amplifier, then a comparator, for further signal conditioning. The output of the comparator is a digital representation of the received baseband signal.</p>
    <p num="p-0189">As shown in FIG. 8, receiver “rx” is an Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) receiver. This is also known as an AM receiver. The illustrated embodiment employs On Off keying (OOK) wherein a digital one (“1”) is represented by the presence of the RF carrier, and wherein a digital zero (“0”) is represented by the absence of the carrier.</p>
    <p num="p-0190">FIGS. 8.01AA-DE illustrate in greater detail the circuit implementation of receiver “rx”. According to this embodiment, Schottky diode detector “diodedet” receives input signals via an input “rxantenna,” and bias voltages for the current source via a pair of inputs “bias<b>1</b>” and “bias<b>2</b>”. A pair of output signals “OUTN” and “OUTP” leave “diodedet” for input to a serially connected chain of amplifiers, and a comparator. The array of amplifiers comprise five video amplifiers, labeled “videoamp<b>1</b>” and “videoamp<b>2</b>”. Bias voltages are applied to “bias<b>1</b>” and “bias<b>2</b>” via “rxbias,” a bias circuit which generates all bias voltages required by the receiver.</p>
    <p num="p-0191">A circuit “rxdet” shown in FIGS. 8.01AA-DE receives the output signal from the comparator, via combinational logic, with “digrxdata” and “digrx”. The output signal “RFDET” is driven high if there is a signal at the output of the comparator. The resulting signal input into “rxdet” is received via “dataIn.” Additional inputs to “rxdet” include “lowrate,” “Vref,” “Vbias<b>1</b>,” “Vbias<b>2</b>,” “Vreg,” and “enable.” Further details of “rxdet” are disclosed below with reference to FIGS. 8.0106AA-CD, entitled “RF Detect”.</p>
    <p num="p-0192">FIGS. 8.101AA-CB illustrate one embodiment for realizing the Schottky diode detector “diodedet” of FIGS. 8.01AA-DE. Namely, a Schottky diode is forward biased from receiving antenna, coupled at “ANT,” to a detector output “OUTP.” A second Schottky diode is forward biased from Vdd to a detector output “OUTN.” Two current sources are formed by four transistors, and are driven by bias voltages at “bias<b>1</b>” and “bias<b>2</b>.” A capacitor is coupled to Vss, between each Schottky diode and associated output, “OUTP” and “OUTN,” respectively. Furthermore, an array of parallel capacitors are provided in series between each Schottky diode and associated output, “OUTP” and “OUTN,” respectively. The array of parallel capacitors acts as a single capacitor. Each Schottky diode is formed from an array of Schottky diodes. In order to use standard contact hole sizes, each Schottky diode is formed from an array of Schottky diodes connected together in parallel to act as a single Schottky diode.</p>
    <p num="p-0193">According to FIGS. 8.01AA-DE, “OUTP” and “OUTN” are input into a multiple (e.g., five) stage amplifier and into a comparator. In order to avoid amplification of substrate noise, a differential amplifier is employed for each stage of the multiple stage amplifier. Noise appears equally on both inputs of each differential amplifier, and, the common mode rejection of the differential amplifiers impedes transmission of substrate noise. The differential amplifiers amplify a received baseband signal up to a digital level. A dummy Schottky diode (the lower Schottky diode in the figures) is connected to the second input of the first differential amplifier.</p>
    <p num="h-0030">Details of Realization of Wide Carrier Frequency Bandwidth</p>
    <p num="p-0194">In order to meet the wide range of intended applications, it is desirable to construct the integrated circuit for an RFID tag to realize operation of a wide range of carrier frequencies. For example, several desirable carrier frequencies for the device disclosed in FIGS. 5 and 6 are 915, 2450, and 5800 MegaHertz bands. Frequency selectivity is realized in the device of FIGS. 5 and 6 by appropriately configuring external antennas and internal circuit components of the integrated circuit. For the case of a single integrated circuit with an active on-board transmitter, it is necessary to design circuit components into the integrated circuitry prior to mounting and encapsulation of the integrated circuit with an antenna inside of a package. Hence, the circuit components needed to facilitate tailoring of the carrier frequency must be “designed in” the integrated circuit. In the case of a backscatter transmitter, components included in the integrated circuit can be selected so as to allow operation over a wide range of carrier frequencies, the selection being made by choice of antenna.</p>
    <p num="p-0195">According to FIGS. 8.01AA-DE, the number of amplifiers that need to be implemented via “videoamp<b>1</b>” and “videoamp<b>2</b>” is determined based upon the magnitude of the minimum detected signal and the required signal to noise (S/N) ratio. Amplification is sufficient to produce full digital levels at the output of the comparator.</p>
    <p num="p-0196">The capacitor configured to ground in the video receiver circuit of FIG. 29 (and FIGS. 8.0101AA-CB) is used to separate the radio frequency (RF) from the “VIDEO AMP” side of the video receiver circuit. The capacitor is sized to impart an effective short circuit to ground at radio frequency, thereby ensuring that all of the radio frequency (RF) voltage appears across the Schottky diode terminals. Additionally, the capacitor should be sized small enough at video frequencies, so that the capacitor does not load down the video amp circuit.</p>
    <p num="p-0197">The capacitor configured in series in the video receiver circuit of FIG. 29 (and FIGS. 8.0101AA-CB) is used to block out the DC component of a voltage to “VIDEO AMP” while retaining the AC component. In this manner, the series capacitor forms a “blocking” capacitor or “coupling” capacitor.</p>
    <p num="h-0031">Details of Inductorless RF Detector</p>
    <p num="p-0198">A second desirable feature for the integrated circuit of an RFID tag is to eliminate the need to use inductors when constructing the Schottky diode detector. One technique for providing a bias current to a Schottky diode is disclosed in FIG. 28. FIG. 28 illustrates a receiver <b>60</b> including an antenna <b>62</b> and a Schottky diode detector <b>64</b>. The receiver <b>60</b> includes inductors <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> used to provide the bias current via voltage source <b>74</b> with this implementation. A capacitor <b>76</b> is shunted to ground, and a second capacitor <b>78</b> is placed in series, providing AC coupling to the video amplifier. Several variations of such inductor-based bias current implementations are described in a paper entitled “Designing Detectors for RF/ID Tags,” by Raymond W. Waugh of Hewlett-Packard Company, submitted for presentation at the RF Expo, San Diego, Feb. 1, 1995, and which is already incorporated by reference. Inductors are required in all of these constructions, but their implementation on an integrated circuit proves difficult because of problems inherent in forming inductors in an integrated circuit. The circuit in FIG. 29 eliminates the inductors by biasing the Schottky diode with a high impedance current source. A current sink is provided by connecting the far end of the antenna to Vdd.</p>
    <p num="h-0032">Details of Elimination of Overdrive Problem</p>
    <p num="p-0199">The Schottky diode detector circuit implementation of FIGS. 8.0101AA-CB realizes a technique for negating the effect of high power radio frequency (RF) input levels on the Schottky diode detector. More particularly, when high level radio frequency (RF) power is present at the antenna “rxantenna,” e.g. when the RFID tag antenna is close to the transmitting antenna of an interrogator, the signal present on node “A” of FIG. 29 becomes large. For example, the signal on node “A” could be several hundreds of millivolts. The rising and falling edges of the detected signal are controlled by two separate time constants which are very different, as shown in FIG. 31. As shown by the high power signal of FIG. 31, the high power signal has a rising edge which is fast, or has a very steep, nearly vertical slope. The nearly vertical slope of the rising edge results because the rising edge is controlled by the effective resistance of the Schottky diode (about 1 kOhm) multiplied by the capacitance of capacitor <b>90</b> (Crf) (about 1-10 pF). Hence, the resulting time constant is about 1 to 10 nanoseconds.</p>
    <p num="p-0200">In contrast, the falling edge of the detected signal in FIG. 31 is controlled by the current source <b>88</b> as it discharges capacitor <b>90</b> (Crf), which takes approximately 100 nanoseconds; As a result, the voltage waveform at node “A” is distorted. According to the amplified digital version of the signal, shown in FIG. 31, the signal in the high power case is distorted by the unequal rise and fall times. The onset of each fall for the digital version is triggered at the cross-over point, which deviates substantially from that of the low power signal. Such a distortion poses a serious problem for implementing clock recovery schemes, which rely on accurate edge-to-edge timing.</p>
    <p num="p-0201">To overcome the above-mentioned problem, the integrated circuit <b>16</b> of FIG. 6 uses only rising edges for clock recovery. Hence, the distorted falling edges are avoided altogether. As becomes apparent from viewing the amplified digital signal of FIG. 31, rising edge to rising edge timing is not affected by the slow falling edges. Therefore, the clock can be accurately recovered.</p>
    <p num="p-0202">FIG. 30 illustrates a circuit <b>93</b> including a Schottky diode detector <b>94</b>, and an antenna <b>44</b> connected to the Schottky diode detector <b>94</b>. More particularly, in the illustrated embodiment, the Schottky diode detector <b>94</b> includes a Schottky diode <b>96</b> having a cathode connected to the antenna <b>44</b> and an anode. The Schottky diode detector <b>94</b> further includes a current source <b>98</b> driving current in the direction from the anode to the cathode of the Schottky diode <b>96</b> and through the antenna <b>44</b>. The Schottky diode detector <b>94</b> further includes a capacitor <b>100</b> connected between the anode of the Schottky diode <b>96</b> and ground; and a capacitor <b>102</b> connected between the anode of the Schottky diode <b>96</b> and an output of the diode detector <b>94</b> which is connected to an amplification circuit. The same technique used with respect to FIG. 29 can also be implemented for the Schottky diode detector circuit of FIG. 30. However, for this case, only the rising edges are significantly distorted, since the Schottky diode is reversed in direction. Therefore, only the falling edges are used in clock recovery.</p>

    <p num="p-0203">A method of forming a Schottky structure that can be employed to manufacture the Schottky diode detector will now be described. A Schottky diode is a diode in which a metal and a semiconductor form a pn junction.

In a more preferred embodiment, the distance from the n+ region diffused edge <b>228</b> to the n-well region contact edge <b>230</b> is about two micrometers.</p>
    <p num="p-0205">More particularly, the integrated circuit <b>16</b> includes a grid pattern of n+ regions <b>222</b>.

Next, an insulator <b>236</b> is formed over the n-well region. In one embodiment, the insulator <b>236</b> is borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG).</p>
    <p num="p-0208">Next, a removal or etching step is performed to remove areas of the insulator <b>236</b> for definition of contact holes <b>238</b>, and areas <b>240</b> generally encircling or surrounding the contact holes <b>238</b> (FIG. 39). The contact holes <b>238</b> are not necessarily circular in cross-section; any cross-sectional shape is possible. Similarly, any cross-sectional shape is possible for the areas <b>240</b> surrounding the contact holes <b>238</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the contact holes <b>238</b> all have the same diameter (or peripheral extent) to facilitate subsequent filling of the contact holes <b>238</b> (described below in greater detail). In an alternative embodiment, different contact holes <b>238</b> have different sizes. In the process of the illustrated embodiment, the contact holes <b>238</b> do not need to be completely filled with a conductor, and all contact holes therefore do not need to be the same size.</p>
    <p num="p-0209">In the illustrated embodiment, the n+ regions <b>222</b> are formed in the n-well region <b>232</b> by diffusion after the etching has been performed, via the openings <b>240</b> surrounding the contact holes <b>238</b>. The n+ regions <b>222</b> can be formed by other processes or in other sequences. For example, the n+ regions <b>222</b> can be formed before the insulator <b>236</b> is formed over the n-well region <b>232</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0210">Next, a Schottky forming metal <b>242</b> such as titanium is formed in the contact hole openings. In the illustrated embodiment, the Schottky forming metal is deposited on the surface of n-well regions <b>224</b> via the contact hole openings <b>238</b>. In one embodiment, the thickness of the deposited metal is about 200 Å. The metal is annealed to form a stable silicide interface to the n-well silicon.</p>
    <p num="p-0211">If it is desired to fill the contact holes, a material such as tungsten <b>246</b> may be deposited into the contact holes (FIG. 40). The tungsten is then planarized to form final contact structures (FIG. 41).</p>
    <p num="p-0212">Then, an interconnect metallization step is performed (FIG. 42). For example, copper doped aluminum <b>248</b> is deposited (e.g. sputtered) over the wafer, then the wafer is masked and etched to remove unwanted areas. The mask defines a pattern to interconnect the contacts as desired.</p>
    <p num="p-0213">A variable number of Schottky diodes may be connected in parallel by simply changing the metal masks and interconnecting only the number of Schottky diodes required by a particular circuit application. In one illustrated embodiment, an array of twelve by twelve Schottky diodes (144 total Schottky diodes) is provided (FIG. 43). In another embodiment (FIG. 42), less than all available Schottky diodes are connected together. In one embodiment, only a six by six array (36 Schottky diodes) is connected together in parallel.</p>
    <p num="p-0214">In one alternative embodiment, aluminum is employed instead of tungsten and silicide. In another alternative embodiment, tungsten is employed instead of aluminum to interconnect contacts, and the step of forming tungsten plugs is omitted.</p>
    <p num="p-0215">In an alternative embodiment (FIG. 47), each Schottky diode includes a p+ region <b>252</b> encircling a “p−” p-well region <b>254</b> and is formed by a method substantially identical to the method described above except with p-type material substituted for n-type material and vice versa. More particularly, in this alternative embodiment, the following steps are performed.</p>
    <p num="p-0216">First, an n-type substrate <b>256</b> is provided (FIG. 44). Next, a common p-well region <b>258</b> is defined relative the substrate <b>256</b>. The common p-well region <b>258</b> defines the p-well regions <b>254</b> for each of the Schottky diodes. Next, an insulator <b>260</b> such as borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG) is formed over the p-well region <b>258</b>. Next, an etching step is performed to etch away regions of the insulator for definition of contact holes, and areas <b>264</b> generally encircling or surrounding the contact holes (FIG. 45). In a preferred embodiment, the contact holes <b>262</b> all have the same diameter (or peripheral extent) to facilitate subsequent filling of the contact holes <b>262</b> with Tungsten or another conductor. In an alternative embodiment, different contact holes <b>262</b> have different diameters. In the process of the illustrated embodiment, the contact holes do not need to be completely filled, and all contact holes therefore do not need to be the same size.</p>
    <p num="p-0217">In the illustrated embodiment, the p+regions <b>252</b> are formed in the p-well regions by diffusion after the etching has been performed, via the openings <b>264</b> encircling the contact holes. The p+regions <b>252</b> can be formed by other processes or at other times. For example, the p+regions <b>252</b> can be formed before the insulator is formed over the p-well region <b>258</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0218">Next, a Schottky forming metal <b>266</b> such as Titanium is formed in the contact hole openings <b>262</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the Schottky forming metal <b>266</b> is deposited on the surface of the p-well region <b>258</b> via the contact hole openings <b>262</b>. In one embodiment, the thickness of the deposited metal is about 200 Å. The metal <b>266</b> is annealed to form a stable silicide interface <b>268</b> to the p-well region <b>258</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0219">If it is desired to fill the contact holes <b>262</b>, a metal such as tungsten <b>270</b> is deposited into the contact holes (FIG. 46). The tungsten <b>270</b> is then planarized to form final contact structures.</p>
    <p num="p-0220">Then, an interconnect metallization step is performed (FIG. 47). For example, copper doped aluminum <b>272</b> is deposited (e.g. sputtered) over the wafer, then the wafer is masked and etched to remove unwanted areas. The mask defines a pattern to interconnect the contacts as desired.</p>
    <p num="p-0221">The above described processes for forming a Schottky diode are preferred over a process wherein, after the contact holes a etched, ion implantation of phosphorus into the holes is performed. In such a process, the implant would be a two step process, with a low energy implant (e.g., 35 keV of 4×10<sup>12 </sup>ions/cm<sup>2</sup>) followed by a high energy implant (e.g., 120 keV of 4×10<sup>12 </sup>ions/cm<sup>2</sup>). Such implants cause a high doping level at the bottom of the contact hole, which prevents formation of a low leakage Schottky diode. The preferred processes described above eliminates these two contact implants, and allows for formation of a good quality Schottky diode.</p>
    <p num="p-0222">FIGS. 8.0101AA-CB provide a circuit drawing of the Schottky diode detector “diodedet.” FIGS. 8.0101AA-CB actually show two Schottky diode detectors. The lower Schottky diode detector shown in FIGS. 8.0101AA-CB is a replicated or dummy detector which generates a signal for the compliment side of the differential amplifier “videoamp<b>1</b>.” The structure of the dummy Schottky diode detector is similar to the real Schottky diode detector so that any noise coupled through ground or possibly through Vdd is replicated on both sides of the differential amplifier “videoamp<b>1</b>” and so that the common mode rejection of the amplifier will result in little noise making it through the amplifier chain. Bias current to the Schottky diode detector is provided by the current source transistors having gates connected to “BIAS<b>1</b>” and “BIAS<b>2</b>” respectively. A path for that current is through the antenna. Thus, the antenna is biased to a high potential Vdd. The array of capacitors in FIGS. 8.0101AA-CB is a series capacitance that couples the output of the Schottky detector to the input of the video amp “videoamp<b>1</b>” and allows an independent bias level to be set at the input of the video amp “videoamp<b>1</b>.” The value of that capacitor in conjunction with the effective resistance seen looking into the amplifier “videoamp<b>1</b>” determines the high pass response of the amplifier “videoamp<b>1</b>.” The values of the capacitor and effective resistance determine the lowest frequency at which the amplifiers can respond, and that frequency is selected to be low enough so that none of the information contained in the base band signal is lost.</p>
    <p num="p-0223">FIGS. 8.0102AA-BD provide a circuit drawing of the CMOS detector “cmosdet” which is employed in an alternative embodiment.</p>
    <p num="h-0034">Details of Quick Bias AC-Coupled Video Amplifier</p>
    <p num="p-0224">FIG. 48 provides a simplified circuit schematic of a quick bias AC-coupled video amplifier <b>270</b>. The video amplifier goes from a power down (unbiased) state to a fully biased state quickly despite a large value effective resistance and capacitor used to bias and couple the amplifier.</p>
    <p num="p-0225">The video amplifier <b>270</b> has an input adapted to be connected to V<sub>in </sub>and includes coupling capacitors <b>292</b> and <b>294</b> at the input.</p>
    <p num="p-0226">The video amplifier includes a voltage divider <b>276</b> including two resistors <b>278</b> and <b>280</b> in series, and four transistors <b>282</b>, <b>284</b>, <b>286</b>, and <b>288</b> shown to the right of a voltage divider in FIG. 48. Transistors <b>286</b> and <b>288</b>, the rightmost two of the four transistors, are long L (length), narrow W (width) p-channel devices operated in linear mode to provide very high effective resistance R<sub>EFF</sub>. Transistors <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> are used instead of resistors because it is hard to provide high resistances using resistors without generating undesirable parasitic capacitance and without taking up more space on an integrated circuit die. The video amplifier <b>270</b> includes a differential amplifier <b>290</b>. The voltage divider <b>276</b> sets a bias voltage at the inputs of the differential amplifier <b>290</b>. The effective resistance R<sub>EFF</sub>, in conjunction with the value of coupling capacitor <b>292</b> or <b>294</b>, sets the angular high pass roll off frequency for the amplifier according to a relationship of ω<sub>HP</sub>=1/((R<sub>EFF</sub>+R<b>1</b>∥R<b>2</b>)C<b>1</b>) where ω is angular frequency (2π times frequency), R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> are the values of the resistors <b>278</b> and <b>280</b> included in the voltage divider <b>276</b>, and C<b>1</b> is the value of one of the coupling capacitors. The values of R<sub>EFF</sub>, and the coupling capacitors are adjusted to achieve the desired high pass roll off frequency ω<sub>HP </sub>as illustrated in FIG. 49. The high pass roll off frequency determines what frequencies will be amplified or attenuated. The high pass roll off frequency is set low enough so that important data is not excluded.</p>
    <p num="p-0227">In many applications, the values of these components are high. For example, in the integrated circuit <b>16</b>, R<sub>EFF </sub>is approximately two MegaOhms, and the capacitance of each of the coupling capacitors <b>292</b> and <b>294</b> is approximately one picoFarad, which gives an angular high pass frequency of approximately 1/((2 MegaOhms)(1 pF))=500 kiloradians/second, or a high pass frequency of 500/2π=79.6 kHz.</p>
    <p num="p-0228">In a powered down state, input V<sub>reg </sub>is zero. Upon power up, there is a delay before the inputs reach the desired bias voltage, according to a relationship V<sub>BIAS</sub>=R<b>1</b>/(R<b>1</b>+R<b>2</b>)V<sub>reg</sub>. The time constant equals R<sub>EFF</sub>C<b>1</b> which is approximately equal to two microseconds.</p>
    <p num="p-0229">If it is decided to wait five time constants, this requires about ten microseconds.</p>
    <p num="p-0230">In accordance with the invention, transistors <b>282</b> and <b>284</b> are added (the two leftmost transistors of the four). These are short L (length) wide W (width) devices which allow the bias voltage to be established in much less time by shorting around the high resistance of the right two transistors <b>286</b> and <b>288</b>. The time constant is thereby reduced. This shorting occurs when an input RXEN is low. Before using the circuit as an amplifier, RXEN is taken high (after bias voltage is achieved). This restores the desired frequency behavior.</p>
    <p num="p-0231">FIGS. 8.0103AA-CF provide a circuit drawing of the video amp “videoamp<b>1</b>.” The video amp “videoamp<b>1</b>” is a differential amplifier with a cascode device isolating a resistor load from differential transistors of the amplifier. This lowers capacitance and improves the frequency response of the amplifier. Bias is provided by a resistor divider shown on the upper left of FIGS. 8.0103AA-CF, which resistor divider provides a potential to two p-channel transistors found almost in the center of the FIGS. 8.0103AA-CF. Each of these p-channel transistors defines a very large resistance, effectively on the order of one to two megaOhms connecting to the nodes of the amplifier to provide the bias. The remaining p-channel devices shown left of center in FIGS. 8.0103AA-CF are shorting devices which short out the two p-channel transistors during the period when the receiver is being powered on out of the sleep mode. The function of these remaining p-channel devices is to cause the inputs to the receiver to come up to the bias level as quickly as possible. They are then shut off in order to leave the circuit with only the high resistance p-channel devices providing the bias. This is necessary from a frequency response standpoint.</p>
    <p num="p-0232">FIGS. 8.0104AA-BC provide a circuit drawing of the video amp “videoamp<b>2</b>.” The video amp “videoamp<b>2</b>” operates in a manner similar to operation of the video amp “videoamp<b>1</b>.” The video amp “videoamp<b>1</b>” has a higher bias current than the video amp “videoamp<b>2</b>.” The reason for this is to minimize the noise generated in the amplifier.</p>
    <p num="p-0233">FIGS. 8.0105AA-EE provide a circuit drawing of the comparator “comparator.” The comparator has biasing considerations similar to the biasing considerations for the video amps, and has a biasing network shown at the left in FIGS. 8.0105AA-EE, at the inputs, which is similar to the biasing networks in the video amps. The function of the comparator “comparator” is to ensure an output at a full digital level.</p>
    <p num="p-0234">FIGS. 8.0106AA-CD provide a circuit drawing of an RF detect circuit “rxdet.” This circuit generates an RF detect signal. The circuit includes an input switch that is either high or low, and a capacitor. If the input switch is high for a sufficient percentage of the time, the input switch will charge up the capacitor. The capacitor has a continual discharge leakage current. As long as the input switch is high sufficiently frequently, the input switch will overcome the capacitor leakage current, and the circuit “rxdet” will put out an RF detect signal.</p>
    <p num="p-0235">FIGS. 8.0107AA-GN provide a circuit drawing showing construction details of the receiver bias generator “rxbias.” The receiver bias generator includes a series of current mirrors to produce bias currents for various stages of the receiver.</p>
    <p num="p-0236">FIGS. 8.0108AA-AC provide a circuit drawing showing construction details of a data transition detector “datatx.” The data transition detector has an input connected to the digital level output of the comparator “comparator” of the receiver “rx” in FIGS. 8.01AA-DE. The data transition detector generates a high going pulse every time there is a transition from high to low or from low to high in the data output by the comparator “comparator.” These transitions are tested by other circuitry, described below, to determine whether or not a valid signal is being received.</p>
    <p num="h-0035">Details of Low Power Frequency Locked Loop</p>
    <p num="p-0237">As previously discussed, the integrated circuit <b>16</b> periodically checks if a radio frequency signal is being received by the receiver. The integrated circuit <b>16</b> includes a timer setting the period for the checking, the timer comprising a frequency locked loop “lpfll.”</p>
    <p num="p-0238">The low power frequency locked loop “lpfll” is shown in greater detail in FIGS. 8.02AA-BC. This is also shown in a simplified schematic in FIG. 24. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 24, the device <b>12</b> includes a frequency locked loop (or phase locked loop) <b>54</b>, a divider <b>55</b> coupled to the input of the loop <b>54</b>, and a divider <b>56</b> coupled to the output of the loop <b>54</b>. A clock (e.g. 9.54 MHz) that is recovered from an incoming radio frequency command from the interrogator <b>26</b> is supplied to the frequency locked loop (or phase locked loop) <b>54</b> after being passed through the divider <b>55</b>. The terms “phase locked loop” or “frequency locked loop” as used herein are meant to describe physical structure, not a state of operation. The term “locked” does not imply that the circuitry is operating, or functioning in a locked condition. Thus, as used herein, “locked” is a term for assisting definition of a particular circuit configuration and is not meant to imply a required state of operation for the circuit. To avoid ambiguity, the appended claims use the terms “phase lock loop” or “frequency lock loop” instead of “phase locked loop” or “frequency locked loop” to indicate that state of operation is not being claimed.</p>
    <p num="p-0239">Phase locked loops and frequency locked loops are similar to one another, except that a phase locked loop tracks phase as well as frequency. A phase locked loop includes a phase detector having a first input receiving the incoming message, having a second input, and having an output; a loop filter having an input coupled to the output of the phase detector and having an output; a voltage controlled oscillator having an input coupled to the output of the loop filter, and having an output defining an output of the phase locked loop; and a divider having an input coupled to the output of the voltage controlled oscillator and having an output connected to the second input of the phase detector. The phase detector produces an output voltage proportional to the phase difference of two input signals. The loop filter is used to control the dynamics of the phase locked loop. The voltage controlled oscillator produces an AC output having a frequency proportional to input control voltage. The divider produces an output signal having a frequency that is an integer division of the input signal. The loop filter includes a capacitor on a control node of the voltage controlled oscillator.</p>
    <p num="p-0240">The frequency locked loop <b>54</b> includes a frequency comparator <b>57</b> receiving the divided recovered clock, an up/down counter <b>58</b> connected to the output of the frequency comparator, and a current controlled oscillator <b>59</b> connected to the output of the up/down counter. The output of the current controlled oscillator <b>59</b> is fed back to the frequency comparator <b>57</b>, and to the divider <b>56</b>. The divider <b>56</b> is programmable (in response to a radio frequency command from the interrogator <b>26</b>) in one embodiment of the invention. To conserve power, the loop <b>54</b> is enabled only during processing of a command from the interrogator <b>26</b>, during which time a recovered clock reference signal is available. In the illustrated embodiment, the current controlled oscillator <b>59</b> is a low power current controlled oscillator “lpcco” shown in FIGS. 8.0204AA-EJ.</p>
    <p num="p-0241">FIGS. 8.02AA-BC provide a circuit drawing of the low power frequency locked loop “lpfll.” This circuit generates a clock which is used in multiple places to time the interval between wake ups. The clock is used as a reference for the timed lock out function, and for the alarm timer wake up function. In a preferred embodiment, the low power frequency locked loop “lpfll” generates a 8 kHz clock. The low power frequency locked loop includes a current controlled oscillator “lpcco” that consumes very little current and that runs continuously from the time power is first supplied to the integrated circuit <b>16</b> (“power up”) until power is removed from the integrated circuit <b>16</b>. During power up, the low power frequency locked loop “lpfll” attempts to synchronize to the main clock recovery oscillator “dcr” (described below). However, that oscillator is not calibrated to anything yet because it has just been powered on. Still, an initial frequency is set for the low power frequency locked loop “lpfll.” On the first successful communication with an interrogator, the low power frequency locked loop “lpfll” is actually calibrated to a known clock frequency and set to a desired frequency (8 kHz in the illustrated embodiment).</p>
    <p num="p-0242">The low power frequency locked loop includes a divider shown at the top of FIGS. 8.02AA-CB. The divider divides down an input clock signal. In the illustrated embodiment, the input clock signal is a 9.5 MHz clock signal. The input clock signal is divided down by a desired factor to get a reference clock for the actual loop shown at the bottom of FIGS. 8.02AA-CB. In the preferred embodiment, the reference clock for the loop shown in FIGS. 8.02AA-CB runs at 8 kHz. The loop receives a loop enable signal “LoopEN”, shown at the lower left of FIGS. 8.02AA-CB. The loop enable signal “LoopEN” enables this frequency locked loop to operate in a loop configuration. The loop enable signal “LoopEN” is asserted when a valid message has been certified and on power up. Those are the only two times the loop enable signal is asserted.</p>
    <p num="p-0243">The frequency of the current controlled oscillator “lpcco” is determined by current input into the current controlled oscillator “lpcco.” A selection of the number of current steps for controlling the oscillator is made by the outputs of the up/down counter “udcounter,” The up/down counter has outputs select <b>1</b> “Sel<b>1</b>,” select <b>2</b> “Sel<b>2</b>,” select <b>4</b> “Sel<b>4</b>,” and select <b>8</b> “Sel<b>8</b>.” The outputs of the up/down counter are labelled according to their binary weights, and that is also how currents are rated within the current controlled oscillator. When the loop is disabled, at the end of processing of a valid command, the count on the output of the up/down counter is frozen so that the select <b>1</b> through select <b>8</b> lines remain constant and they keep that same frequency in the low power frequency locked loop “lpfll” until the next valid command is processed. At the time when the next valid command is processed, if the clock frequency of the low power frequency locked loop has drifted, the loop sets the frequency back to the desired frequency (e.g., 8 kHz).</p>
    <p num="p-0244">FIGS. 8.0201AA-AB provide a circuit drawing showing construction details of a timed lockout divider cell “tldcel_bypass” included in the circuit of FIGS. 8.02AA-BC.</p>
    <p num="p-0245">FIGS. 8.0202AA-CD provide a circuit drawing of a frequency comparator “freqcomp” of the frequency locked loop “lpfll.” The frequency comparator counts a certain number of cycles of the reference clock and also counts how many cycles of the low power clock occurred within that number of cycles. The frequency comparator thus determines whether the low power clock “lpfll” is running too fast, too slow, or on time. If the clock is running too fast or too slow, the frequency comparator makes an adjustment by causing the counter “udcounter” to either count up or count down. If no adjustment is necessary, the frequency comparator makes no adjustment to the counter.</p>
    <p num="p-0246">FIGS. 8.0203AA-BC provide a circuit drawing showing construction details of the up/down counter “udcounter” included in the low power frequency locked loop “lpfll.” The counter has some logic on the counter's output so that if the counter counts all the way down to zero, the counter does not wrap around and go to all ones. Instead, the counter stops at zero (until a signal requesting an up count is received). Similarly, if the counter counts all the way up to all ones, the counter does not wrap around to all zeros. Instead, the counter stops at all ones (until a signal requesting a down count is received).</p>
    <p num="p-0247">FIGS. 8.020301AA-BB provide a circuit drawing showing construction details of an adder “udcounter_adder” included in the up/down counter.</p>

    <p num="h-0036">Details of Low Power Current Controlled Oscillator</p>
    <p num="p-0249">The integrated circuit <b>16</b> includes the low power current controlled oscillator “lpcco.” The oscillator consumes very little current (e.g., less than 100 nA). The oscillator “lpcco” includes digital input lines, and oscillates at a frequency controlled by the digital input lines. The circuit includes a thermal generator, a digitally controlled current mirror, an oscillator, and an output driver.</p>
    <p num="p-0250">FIGS. 8.0204AA-EJ provide a circuit drawing of the low power current controlled oscillator “lpcco.” The low power current controlled oscillator “lpcco” includes a thermal voltage generator, including a string of resistors, shown in FIGS. 8.0204AA-EJ in the upper left corner. The thermal voltage generator generates a small voltage proportional to kT/q across the string of resistors where k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38×10<sup>−23 </sup>Joules per degree Kelvin, T is temperature in degrees Kelvin, and q is the electron charge in Coulombs. The voltage kT/q is approximately equal to 26 mV at room temperature. That small voltage divided by the resistor value sets the current in the circuit. This current is approximately equal to (kT/qR)ln((W/L)Q<b>1</b>)/(W/L)Q<b>2</b>). In the illustrated embodiment, the current is set to a low value (e.g., approximately three nano-amps).</p>
    <p num="p-0251">Thermal generators are known in the art. See for example, “CMOS Analog Integrated Circuits Based on Weak Inversion Operation” by Eric Vittoz and Jean Fellrath, IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, Vol. SC-12, No. 3, June 1977. See particularly FIG. 8 of this article, and the associated description.</p>
    <p num="p-0252">The low power current controlled oscillator “lpcco” also includes a wake up circuit shown to the far left of the thermal voltage generator that causes a much higher current to flow initially to turn on the feedback loop. The wake up circuit then shuts off and leaves the low value (nano-amp) current flowing. Thus, initialization occurs on power up and the wake up circuit is off after that unless power is removed and reapplied. The outputs of the up/down counter “udcounter,” select <b>1</b> “Sel<b>1</b>,” select <b>2</b> “Sel<b>2</b>,” select <b>4</b> “Sel<b>4</b>,” and select <b>8</b> “Sel<b>8</b>” come into the low power current controlled oscillator as shown on the left edge of FIGS. 8.0204AA-EJ. The low power current controlled oscillator further includes control circuitry shown on the bottom strip of FIGS. 8.0204AA-EJ. These outputs of the up/down counter control the number of currents that are mirrored into this control circuitry by a current mirror. The current mirror is digitally controlled and weightings are binary in the illustrated embodiment; however, any weighting scheme can be used. The current mirror includes transistors operating in the subthreshold, or weak inversion mode, due to the extremely low current level.</p>
    <p num="p-0253">More particularly, referring to FIGS. 8.0204AA-EJ, there are five transistors to the right of the string of resistors, mirrored down to one about the center of the page providing a divide by five. Current is then mirrored through all the p-channel devices. The block shown in the upper right of FIGS. 8.0204AA-EJ is a selectable current mirror. The first stage generates one current equal to the reference current and that is always flowing into the n-channel diode down at the bottom of that stack. Shown to the right of the n-channel diode are the selectable groups of p-channels. The first one has one, the next two, the next four, the next eight in a binary sequence. The transistors shown below the p-channels transistors are select devices and they are controlled by the digital signals select <b>1</b> “Sel<b>1</b>,” select <b>2</b> “Sel<b>2</b>,” select <b>4</b> “Sel<b>4</b>,” and select <b>8</b> “Sel<b>8</b>.” Thus, the number of currents can be selected and however many are selected are added into the one that is always flowing in the diode.</p>
    <p num="p-0254">The current from groups of p-channel transistors that are not selected is diverted over to a separate or second diode shown on the far right of FIGS. 8.0204AA-EJ. This is so that when a block of transistors is not selected, their drain nodes do not get pulled up to V<sub>DD</sub>. By sinking the current in this second diode, the voltage at the drain node of all unselected block of transistors is kept down near the voltage at which it will operate when and if it is actually connected over to the first diode. This is so that, upon switching a select line, a capacitance doesn't have to be charged from V<sub>DD </sub>down to the proper operating voltage. In any case, the selected number of currents are added together into the first diode, and then that voltage is carried on the line shown in FIGS. 8.0204AA-EJ as going down the right side of page, which line has a capacitor tied to it. That capacitor is a filter capacitor so that the voltage on that node does not change abruptly when the select lines change or when some unrelated signal nearby switches. Since all of these transistors are operating in a sub-threshold or weak inversion mode, a small change in the voltage on their gate will otherwise result in a rather large impact on the operation of the circuit. That line is the input for the circuitry shown across the bottom of FIGS. 8.0204AA-EJ. There is a current mirror situation there, so that the sum of all the selected currents plus the one default current flowing in the diode above is mirrored and flows through the p-channel devices of this circuitry. There is then another mirror to generate bias voltages for the n-channel current source devices for the VCO ring oscillator. The p-channel gate voltages are used in mirroring into the p-channel load devices of the same ring oscillator. The frequency of this ring oscillator is controlled by the current mirrored to them.</p>
    <p num="p-0255">The low power current controlled oscillator includes a four stage ring oscillator. The frequency of oscillation is approximately proportional to the amount of current flowing. The frequency of oscillation of the four stage ring oscillator is directly proportional to its bias current over a wide range of frequencies. For example, frequency is directly proportional to bias current for frequencies between approximately 100 Hz and tens of MHZ (e.g. to twenty MHZ).</p>
    <p num="p-0256">The low power current controlled oscillator further includes an output driver. In the illustrated embodiment, the output driver includes a comparator circuit receiving the output of the fourth stage ring. The purpose for this comparator is to convert the small output signal of the oscillator to full digital levels. In the illustrated embodiment, full digital levels are zero volts and V<sub>DD</sub>. In the illustrated embodiment, V<sub>DD </sub>is 3.3 Volts ±0.3 Volts. In an alternative embodiment, V<sub>DD </sub>is 5 Volts ±10 or 20%. Another other suitable values can be employed for V<sub>DD </sub>and the digital levels.</p>
    <p num="p-0257">Circuitry is included to eliminate the crossover current in the n and p channel devices in the first few invertors. This is because, when operated at very low current levels, the rise and fall times are long and could allow substantial current to flow in the n and p channel devices during switching.</p>
    <p num="p-0258">The digital levels are buffered and amplified up by the comparator to provide an output signal from the low power frequency locked loop “lpfll.” The output of the low power current controlled oscillator is shown on the right edge of FIGS. 8.0204AA-EJ. In the illustrated embodiment, the low power current controlled oscillator operates at eight kHz. However, if desired for alternative embodiments, the low power current controlled oscillator is capable of running at a frequency from approximately 100 Hz to 20 kHz. In an alternative embodiment, the low power current controlled oscillator is capable of running at a frequency from approximately 100 Hz to 30 kHz.</p>
    <p num="p-0259">The low power current controlled oscillator consumes very little power. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the low power current controlled oscillator consumes less than a milliAmp. More particularly, in the illustrated embodiment, the low power current controlled oscillator consumes approximately 100 nanoAmps.</p>
    <p num="p-0260">In an alternative embodiment, instead of using a thermal voltage generator, a transistor is biased in the subthreshold region in order to define the current source and to generate a small current. However, in this embodiment, the voltage on the gate of the transistor is updated periodically as it leaks away.</p>
    <p num="p-0261">Although the low power current controlled oscillator has been described in connection with a radio frequency identification device, the low power current controlled oscillator can be advantageously employed in any battery powered electronic product which must keep track in time.</p>
    <p num="p-0262">FIGS. 8.03AA-AB provide a circuit drawing showing construction details of a counter bit “lpfll_cbit” included in the receiver “rx.”</p>
    <p num="p-0263">FIGS. 8.04AA-EE provide a circuit drawing of the wake up controller “rxwu.” An input to the wake up controller is a clock signal “LPCLK” from the low power frequency locked loop “lpfll.” This clock signal input is shown in the upper left of FIGS. 8.04AA-EE. The clock signal “LPCLK” is further divided down to provide certain time intervals available for selection. These are the time intervals at which the integrated circuit <b>16</b> will wake up and look for a radio frequency signal. In the illustrated embodiment, these time intervals are set at 0.5, 16, 64 and 256 milliseconds. The selection of one of these multiple available time intervals is accomplished via radio frequency command from the interrogator.</p>
    <p num="p-0264">The wake up controller includes wake up abort logic shown in the lower left of FIGS. 8.04AA-EE. The wake up abort logic performs a number of tests (described elsewhere herein) to determine whether the received signal is a valid signal and, if all tests are passed, then the wake up controller asserts a signal on line “RXWU” shown on the right of FIGS. 8.04AA-EE. This signal wakes up the processor, and the processor then processes the command contained in the message.</p>
    <p num="h-0037">Details of Wake Up Tests</p>
    <p num="p-0265">FIGS. 8.0401AA-AB provide a circuit drawing of a wake up abort logic circuit “wuabort.” The wake up abort logic circuit provides for conservation of battery power. If what is received is not a valid message, the wake up abort logic circuit determines this quickly and the device returns to the sleep mode so that the battery is not drained on invalid messages or spurious communication. The wake up abort logic circuit works by counting clock cycles. The wake up abort logic circuit has as an input a clock signal “CHIPCLK” that is the output of the clock recovery oscillator “dcr” (described below). This clock signal is divided down by a factor of four, which results in a value approximately equal to the spread spectrum chip rate. After the clock is actually acquired from a message from the interrogator, the resulting value will be equal to the chip rate.</p>
    <p num="p-0266">Initially though, when these wake up tests are performed, a clock has not yet been acquired from a message. The wake up abort logic includes an RF Detect Timer, shown on the top, left of FIGS. 8.0401AA-EE, which performs a first test. The RF Detect Timer counts a predetermined number of cycles of the clock (e.g., 13 cycles) and, if the RF detect signal from the receiver is not asserted, the wake up is aborted. On the other hand, if the RF detect signal is asserted within those cycles, the wake up abort logic starts the next series of tests without waiting for the end of the predetermined number of cycles.</p>
    <p num="p-0267">The next series of tests are timed by a counter shown across the center of the page in FIGS. 8.0401AA-EE. For the next tests, transitions in the incoming data stream are counted within a certain time interval and the number of transitions must fall within a certain range in order to pass the test. Transitions are counted by the counter shown at the bottom in FIGS. 8.0401AA-EE. The range limits are set by knowing the number of transitions that should occur in the data within the amount of time allowed. This is known because each data bit is encoded as a thirty-one chip sequence as described elsewhere herein. The reason there is a range is because the clock has not yet been acquired accurately so there is a range of clock frequencies that must be considered. In the illustrated embodiment, one test checks whether, after five counts of the clock, there has been between greater than or equal to one, and less than eight transitions in the data. If not, the wake up is aborted and the device goes back to sleep. If yes, then the next test is performed.</p>
    <p num="p-0268">The next test checks whether, after twenty-six clock counts, there are greater than or equal to fourteen and less than thirty-two transitions in the data. If not, wake up is aborted and the chip goes back to the sleep mode. If this test is passed, the wake up abort logic circuit performs tests relating to signals generated by the clock recovery nodes. One such test is a test for chip lock. Chip lock is an indication that clock recovery is proceeding and has actually gotten within a few percent of the desired clock frequency. The final check is whether frequency lock has occurred. Again, these tests are timed. If one of the signals is not asserted by the time the timer signal goes high, then the wake up will be aborted and the device goes back to sleep and will try again after another wake up interval. Frequency lock will come into the logic in the center of the page in FIGS. 8.04AA-CB, and that is what causes the RXWU signal to be asserted, thus waking up the processor.</p>
    <p num="p-0269">Another function of the wake up abort logic shown in FIGS. 8.0401AA-EE is to discriminate between high rate and low rate. The wake up abort logic measures time while these tests are performed to determine when the interrogator is in high rate, but the chip is in low rate or vice versa and abort out of wake up (return to the sleep mode).</p>
    <p num="p-0270">These tests will now be described in connection with flowcharts illustrated in FIGS. 25-27.</p>
    <p num="p-0271">The wake up controller “rxwu” was described above in connection with FIGS. 8.04AA-EE. The wake up tests performed by the wake up controller are illustrated in flow chart form in FIGS. 25-26.</p>
    <p num="p-0272">When the integrated circuit <b>16</b> first wakes up, bias generators and the receiver “rx” are powered on (step S<b>1</b> in FIG. 25). After ensuring that the bias is on (step S<b>2</b> in FIG. 25), the master clock “dcr” is started. By design, the master clock “dcr” starts at a frequency below the final frequency it will achieve after the clock recovery circuit “lpfll” extracts the clock frequency from the incoming signal. More particularly, in the illustrated embodiment, the master clock starts at a start frequency above half of the final frequency it will achieve after the clock recovery circuit “lpfll” extracts the clock frequency from the incoming signal. Still more particularly, in the illustrated embodiment, the master clock starts at a start frequency between half and three quarters of the final frequency the master clock will achieve after the clock recovery circuit “lpfll” extracts the clock frequency from the incoming signal. In the illustrated embodiment, the final frequency is 38.15 MHZ, and the start frequency is between 20 and 30 MHZ. The master clock includes a frequency locked loop including a voltage controlled oscillator. An offset is applied to the oscillator to make sure that the clock starts at least as fast as 20 MHZ. Then, the frequency locked loop adjusts the frequency to 38.15 MHZ.</p>
    <p num="p-0273">Because the clock has not yet been acquired from the incoming signal, the clock is a free running oscillator when providing the start frequency. Initial wake up tests are performed at this lower start frequency. The receiver “rx,” digital clock and data recovery circuit “dcr,” pseudo random number processor “pnproc,” and voltage controlled oscillator “vco” are turned on (step S<b>3</b> in FIG. 25).</p>
    <p num="p-0274">The input radio frequency signal received from the interrogator <b>26</b> is a direct sequence spread spectrum input signal in the illustrated embodiment. Spread spectrum techniques are described above. In one embodiment, incoming radio frequency commands are included in packets that contain, in order of transmission, a preamble, a Barker code, and the command. In one embodiment, each bit of the incoming radio frequency command sent by the interrogator is modulated using a pseudo noise (PN) sequence for direct sequence spread spectrum communication.</p>
    <p num="p-0275">After the clock is running, the device <b>12</b> is in a receiver on mode illustrated in FIG. 27 by a vertical line marked “WAKEUP RX ON.” After the clock is running, the device <b>12</b> performs wake up tests (at the lower or start frequency).</p>
    <p num="p-0276">A first test is whether the receiver “rx” detects any radio frequency signal within a predetermined number of clock cycles (step S<b>4</b> in FIG. 25). In the illustrated embodiment, this predetermined number of clock cycles is 13. If no radio frequency signal is detected by the receiver “rx” within 13 clock cycles, the device <b>12</b> returns to the sleep mode. If a radio frequency signal is detected by the receiver “rx” within 13 clock cycles, the device <b>12</b> switches to a wake up abort test mode illustrated in FIG. 27 by a vertical line marked “WAKEUP ABORT TESTS,” and a second test is performed.</p>
    <p num="p-0277">In the second test, a determination is made as to whether a predetermined number of data transition pulses occur within a predetermined number of clock pulses for the radio frequency signal detected by the receiver “rx” (step S<b>5</b> in FIG. 25). More particularly, the device <b>12</b> includes a long counter shown in FIGS. 8.0401AA-EE driven by a clock signal “CHIPCLK.” The device <b>12</b> further includes a circuit “datatx” which detects transitions in the signal received by the receiver “rx” and generates a pulse (“DTX” in FIG. 26) at each transition. The device <b>12</b> further includes another counter circuit shown in FIGS. 8.0401AA-EE which counts these pulses. Because a valid incoming signal is modulated with a known PN sequence, the number of transitions in a given time for a valid incoming signal is known. The device <b>12</b> includes logic “wuabort” that tests whether the proper number of data transition pulses occur within a certain number of clock pulses. More particularly, in the illustrated embodiment, the logic tests whether more than or equal to one and less than eight such data transition pulses occur within five chips. If not, the device returns to the sleep mode. If so, a third test is performed.</p>
    <p num="p-0278">In the third test, a determination is made as to whether a predetermined number of data transition pulses occur within a predetermined number of clock pulses for the radio frequency signal detected by the receiver “rx” (step S<b>5</b> in FIG. 26). The third test is similar to the second test, except that the number of data transition pulses is tested against a number of clock pulses that is different from the number in the second test. More particularly, in the illustrated embodiment, the logic tests whether more than or equal to fourteen and less than thirty-two such data transition pulses occur within thirty-one chips. If not, the device <b>12</b> returns to the sleep mode.</p>
    <p num="p-0279">If the above transition tests are passed, the device <b>12</b> checks to see if the clock recovery circuit locks onto the incoming clock rate. More particularly, in the illustrated embodiment, a determination is made as to whether a clock is acquired from the incoming signal within 6 k chips (step S<b>7</b> in FIG. 26). A determination is then made as to whether frequency lock is achieved within 16 k chips (step S<b>9</b> in FIG. 26). The device <b>12</b> returns to the sleep mode if any of these tests fail. If these tests are passed, then the device <b>12</b> enters a processor on mode illustrated in FIG. 27 by a vertical line marked “PROCESSOR ON.” Power is supplied to the processor (step S<b>10</b> in FIG. 26) and the device <b>12</b> waits for the preamble of the incoming message to end and the command to begin.</p>
    <p num="p-0280">In one embodiment, the tests of FIG. 26 are employed to distinguish between incoming signals with different possible valid chipping rates.</p>
    <p num="p-0281">More particularly, in the illustrated embodiment, it is known how long each of the various tests should take for valid low chipping rate or high chipping rate signals, and this information can be tested to determine whether the incoming signal is a high rate or low rate signal.</p>
    <p num="p-0282">Other appropriate tests can be performed in embodiments where spread spectrum is not employed. In these embodiments, knowing how valid data is encoded, the wake up timer and logic still compares the number of transitions received in a given amount of time with an expected number of transitions for a valid signal.</p>

    <p num="h-0038">Details of Lock Detection in a Digital Clock Recovery Loop</p>
    <p num="p-0285">In many communications systems, it is necessary to recover a clock signal from the received data. A phase locked loop is one way of recovering such a clock signal. In the illustrated embodiment, such a recovered clock is used as a master clock.</p>
    <p num="p-0286">The integrated circuit <b>16</b> includes the digital clock and data recovery circuit “dcr” which includes a phase locked loop. The phase locked loop includes a voltage controlled oscillator “dcr_vco.” The frequency of the voltage controlled oscillator always starts low, at between 50% and 75% of the final desired value. When the voltage controlled oscillator starts running, large steps are taken (FIG. 54). As the frequency approaches the final value, increasingly smaller steps are taken to achieve greater accuracy. The illustrated embodiment employs four step sizes: large, medium, medium-fine, and fine. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, large steps up are employed between 50% to 75% of the final desired value, and medium steps up are then taken above 75% until pump up commands are not issued for a predetermined number of transitions, then medium-fine steps up are employed until the final value is overshot, then fine steps down are employed.</p>
    <p num="p-0287">A method is needed to determine when the frequency of the voltage controlled oscillator matches the desired frequencies contained in the received data.</p>
    <p num="p-0288">The voltage controlled oscillator includes a control node having a voltage indicative of the frequency of the voltage controlled oscillator. The behavior of this node is used to determine when frequency lock has occurred.</p>
    <p num="p-0289">After the phase locked loop has run long enough to get within a few percent of the final value (at a time illustrated as To in FIG. 54), a signal “SDD” (start data decoding) is generated. This signal “SDD” disables the large and medium steps and enables lock detect circuitry for determining if frequency lock has occurred. A latch “KILLSU” (kill start up) detects when the first fine step pump down occurs (at T<sub>1 </sub>in FIG. 54). This enables a latch “FREQLOCK.” The latch “FREQLOCK” is set when the first fine step pump up occurs (at a time illustrated as T<sub>2 </sub>in FIG. 54). A signal “FREQLOCK” is then indicative that the phase locked loop has reached its final value.</p>
    <p num="p-0290">In other words, large, medium, then medium-fine steps up are followed by fine steps down. The final value is overshot, and a frequency lock signal is provided upon occurrence of the first subsequent fine step up.</p>
    <p num="p-0291">In the illustrated embodiment, the final value of the voltage on the control node of the voltage controlled oscillator, where frequency lock is expected, is approximately 1.2 Volts. In one embodiment, each large step is approximately several hundred milliVolts, each medium step has a size approximately in the tens of milliVolts (e.g., 25 milliVolts), each medium-fine step has a size of approximately a few milliVolts (e.g. two milliVolts), and each fine step has a size approximately in the tenths of milliVolts. Various other relative sizes or numbers of steps are employed in alternative embodiments.</p>
    <p num="p-0292">The sizes of steps is set using current sources of different values that are turned on for a fixed period of time to drive to the capacitor on the control node of the voltage controlled oscillator.</p>
    <p num="p-0293">In the illustrated embodiment, the fine step generator is not disabled before time T<sub>0 </sub>so there is a possibility that a combination of fine steps with larger steps can take place before time T<sub>0</sub>. In an alternative embodiment, however, the fine step generator is disabled before time T<sub>0</sub>.</p>
    <p num="p-0294">FIGS. 8.05AA-CB provide a circuit drawing of the digital clock and data recovery circuit “der.” The digital clock and data recovery circuit includes a phase locked loop of a digital design, and a state machine “dcr_statemachine” that drives the phase locked loop. The phase locked loop includes a voltage controlled oscillator “dcr_vco” and control circuitry “dcr_vcocontrol” for the voltage controlled oscillator. The voltage controlled oscillator “dcr_vco” includes a control node (“OUTN” and “OUTP” shown in FIGS. 8.0504AA-EE and described below in greater detail) and produces an oscillation at a rate dependent on the value of a voltage applied to the control node. In the illustrated embodiment, the state machine has four states. The phase locked loop produces an output pulse on a line “OUTC” (later labeled “FMASTER”). The digital clock and data recovery circuit attempts to place four pulses of the output clock within one chip time.</p>
    <p num="p-0295">The state machine “dcr_statemachine” determines when that is not the case and, if not, whether to cause the oscillator to run faster or to run slower. The state machine “dcr_statemachine” then issues appropriate pump up or pump down signals to drive a control node of the oscillator. The voltage controlled oscillator “dcr_vco” starts out at a minimum frequency as determined by an offset current which is present regardless of the loop. This ensures that the oscillator will start up and run at greater than 50% of the final value so that the phase locked loop will converge on the proper frequency. The digital clock and data recovery circuit also includes a PLL start-up circuit “dcr_startup.” The acquisition of the clock frequency happens in stages and, initially, the control node moves in large increments towards its final value. The start-up circuit “dcr_startup” provides large increments for controlling the loop. However, as the digital clock and data recovery circuit gets closer to acquisition of clock frequency, control switches from that start up circuit “dcr_startup” over to the state machine “dcr_statemachine.” The state machine provides very fine steps as the final convergence is done with very fine steps. The data stream is fed into the circuitry on the upper right. Then the data is sampled during one of the states of the state machine after it has been determined that the data is valid. The data stream is recreated and called “RXCHIPS.”</p>
    <p num="p-0296">FIGS. 8.0501AA-BE provide a circuit drawing of the start up circuit “dcr_startup” included in the digital clock and data recovery circuit. In the illustrated embodiment, the start up circuit provides either very large or fairly large steps dependent upon how far from frequency the oscillator is running. The start up circuit also has a counter (shown along the bottom in FIGS. 8.0501AA-BE) that determines when there have been no pump up commands issued for a given count of transitions. In the illustrated embodiment, the counter determines when there have been no pump up commands during sixteen transitions. If the given count of transitions are detected in the data and there has been no pump up command (e.g., no pump up medium or pump up fast command) then a signal is asserted on a line “SDD.” SDD stands for Start Data Decode and is an indication that the control voltage has converged to within a few percent.</p>

    <p num="p-0298">FIGS. 8.0502AA-CD provide a circuit drawing of the state machine “dcr_statemachine.” In the illustrated embodiment, the state machine has four states. The state machine includes two flip-flops with feedback signals providing the four states. This circuit generates pump up slow, and pump down slow commands for adjusting voltage on a control node of the voltage controlled oscillator.</p>
    <p num="p-0299">This circuit also has the circuitry that turns off the start up circuit and generates the frequency lock signal. When trying to acquire frequency lock, there will be large and medium pump ups, without any pump downs, until the final desired value is overshot. At this point, there will be a first pump down slow pulse. When the first pump down slow command is issued, the start up circuitry “dcr_startup” is turned off, which leaves only fine step capability for adjustment in the control voltage. It takes time for the fine steps to bring down the control node voltage to the proper value and the voltage on the control node will overshoot the desired voltage in the negative direction. The state machine will detect that it has gone too far and it will step the voltage back up towards the final value and that first fine step up will be detected and at that point the frequency lock signal is asserted.</p>

    <p num="p-0304">In many communications systems it is necessary to recover a clock signal from the received digital data stream. In the device <b>12</b>, this clock signal is used as the master timing reference to eliminate the need for an external crystal-based timing reference. Typically, a phase locked loop of some type is used to extract the clock.</p>
    <p num="p-0305">There are many requirements on the phase locked loop used to recover a clock signal from the received digital data stream. Several important ones for this application are that the phase locked loop must acquire the desired frequency without locking to a multiple or sub-multiple of the desired frequency; the phase locked loop must lock to the desired frequency within a certain time of interest; and the phase locked loop must yield consistent performance despite wide variation in device parameters which is inherent in integrated circuit processing. The phase locked loop employed in the illustrated embodiment, embodied in the digital clock recovery circuitry “dcr,” satisfies all of these requirements.</p>
    <p num="p-0306">In the illustrated embodiment, the forward link baseband data is encoded for direct sequence spread spectrum.

    <p num="p-0307">The mode of operation of the device <b>12</b> is as follows. The chip periodically awakens from a low-current sleep mode in order to detect whether an incoming RF message is present. The clock recovery loop “dcr” is inactive in the low-current sleep mode.

If the incoming signal passes these tests, the clock recovery loop is enabled, the clock is acquired, the message is processed, and a reply is sent.

In alternative embodiments, other integer numbers could be used. In the illustrated embodiment, a state machine having four states is employed to cause the frequency at the output of the voltage controlled oscillator to increase until exactly four cycles of the clock fit within the time interval of a single chip. A general description of the behavior of the control node voltage can be found above in the section titled Details of Lock Detection in a Digital Clock Recovery Loop.</p>
    <p num="p-0315">What follows is a discussion of the operation of each block of the digital clock recovery loop. The start-up circuit <b>708</b> is show in FIG. 61. Although it may be simplified from the circuitry shown in the detailed schematics including “dcr_startup” shown in FIGS. 8.0501AA-BE, the theory of operation is the same.</p>
    <p num="p-0316">The start-up circuit <b>708</b> includes a plurality of flip-flops <b>712</b> chained together, a plurality of flip-flops <b>714</b> chained together, and an exclusive-or gate <b>716</b>. The exclusive-or gate <b>716</b> has an output connected to the input of the first of the flip-flops <b>714</b>, has an input connected to the output of the last of the flip-flops <b>712</b>, and has another input connected to the input of the same flip-flop <b>712</b>. More particularly, in the illustrated embodiment, each flip-flop <b>712</b> and <b>714</b> is a D-type flip-flop and has a D input, a clock input, and a Q output. The D input of flip-flops <b>712</b> other than the first flip-flop is connected to the Q output of a previous flip-flop <b>712</b>. The first flip-flop <b>712</b> is connected to the input data “Data In.” The D input of flip-flops <b>714</b> other than the first flip-flop <b>714</b> is connected to the Q output of a previous flip-flop <b>714</b>. The first flip-flop <b>714</b> is connected to the output of the exclusive-or gate <b>716</b>. The clock inputs of the flip-flops <b>712</b> and <b>714</b> are all tied to the output <b>704</b> of the voltage controlled oscillator <b>702</b>. Data is shifted from the D input of each flip-flop to the Q output of the same flip-flop on each clock pulse. Thus, the flip-flops <b>712</b> as a group define a shift register, and the flip-flops <b>714</b> as a group define a shift register.</p>
    <p num="p-0317">The start-up circuit <b>708</b> further includes an AND gate <b>718</b> that has one input that is the output of the exclusive-or gate <b>716</b>, has a second input that is the output of the second of the flip-flops <b>714</b>, and defines an output “Puf<b>1</b>” (a first pump up fast output). The start-up circuit <b>708</b> further includes an AND gate <b>720</b> that has one input that is the output of the exclusive-or gate <b>716</b>, has a second input that is the output of the third of the flip-flops <b>714</b>, and defines an output “Puf<b>2</b>” (a second pump up fast output).</p>
    <p num="p-0318">The start-up circuit <b>708</b> further includes a counter <b>722</b> that receives as inputs “Puf<b>1</b>” and “Puf<b>2</b>” and generates an output “SDD” (start data decode) when the output of the voltage controlled oscillator <b>702</b> is close to its final value.</p>
    <p num="p-0319">The exclusive-or gate <b>716</b> in the center of the page generates a high output whenever there is a transition in the data as sampled by the clock signal output by the voltage controlled oscillator <b>702</b> output clock. Assume for discussion that data is latched into all flip-flops <b>712</b> and <b>714</b> on the falling edge of the clock. Puf<b>2</b> goes high when three falling edges of the clock occur within one chip because the inputs of the AND gate are spaced apart by three flip-flops. Three falling edges of the clock occur within one chip when the frequency is between 75% and 100% of the final value. Puf<b>1</b> goes high when two falling edges of the clock occur within one chip because the inputs of the AND gate are spaced apart by two flip-flops. Two falling edges of the clock occur within one chip when the clock frequency is 50% to 75% of its final value. This is shown on the waveform diagram of FIG. 63 for the case when the frequency is exactly 50%. Puf<b>1</b> could be used to pump up the control node of the voltage controlled oscillator <b>702</b> rapidly. Puf<b>2</b> could be used to pump up the control node of the voltage controlled oscillator <b>702</b> at a rate equal to that for Puf<b>1</b> (as is shown in FIG. 61) or it could pump at a slower rate (as is done in the circuitry shown in the detailed schematics). As the clock frequency approaches 75% of final in the Puf<b>1</b> case or 100% of final in the Puf<b>2</b> case, pump up signals occur infrequently as error must accumulate over a long time to cause the appropriate number of clock edges to shift within a chip. This is used to detect when the clock frequency is close to its final value.</p>
    <p num="p-0320">The counter <b>722</b> counts transition pulses until it is cleared by a Puf<b>1</b> or Puf<b>2</b> signal. If a predetermined large number of transitions are counted before a pump up occurs, a signal is asserted on a line SDD (start data decode). In the illustrated embodiment, if sixteen transitions are counted before a pump up occurs, a signal is asserted on line SDD. This indicates that the voltage on the control node of the voltage controlled oscillator is within a few percent of its final value, allowing data to be accurately recovered.</p>
    <p num="p-0321">In the illustrated embodiment, the state machine <b>710</b> issues finer pump-up signals than the start-up circuit <b>708</b>, and can also issue pump-down signals. In the illustrated embodiment, the start-up circuit <b>708</b> only issues pump up signals. The state machine <b>710</b> has as many states as the number of clock cycles which fit within one chip time. In the illustrated embodiment, the state machine has four states. The state machine <b>710</b> counts clock pulses and expects the data to transition at a count of one every time there is a transition. If the transition actually occurs at a count of four then the clock is too slow and a pump up is issued. If the transition actually occurs at a count of two then the clock is too fast and a pump down is issued. If the transition actually occurs at a count of three, it is not known whether the clock is fast or slow so no adjustment is made to the voltage controlled oscillator. A state diagram is shown in FIG. 64.</p>
    <p num="p-0322">Design of a clocked sequential circuit is known in the art. See, for example, chapter 6 of Digital Logic and Computer Design by M. Morris Mano, 1979, Prentice-Hall, Inc. A typical design procedure involves describing circuit behavior using a state diagram (see FIG. 64), obtaining a state table (see FIG. 66), assigning binary values to each state (see FIG. 64), determining the number of flip-flops needed (see FIG. 65), choosing the type of flip-flops to be used (see FIG. 65), using Karnaugh maps or other simplification methods, deriving circuit output functions and flip-flop input functions (see FIGS. 67 and 68), and drawing the logic diagram.</p>
    <p num="p-0323">The numbers in parentheses in FIG. 64 are the binary state numbers. ENDT enables the sampling of the data (always at state two when no transition occurred). There are several ways to implement a circuit to perform functions of a state diagram. Assume that Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>0</b> are the binary state numbers in parentheses above (Q<b>1</b> on the left, Q<b>0</b> on the right), and that D<b>1</b> and D<b>0</b> are the next state values of Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>0</b>, respectively. This is illustrated in FIG. 65. The flip-flop outputs Q<b>0</b> and Q<b>1</b> are the states. Then, a state table can be derived. This is shown in FIG. 66. Using Karnaugh maps (see FIGS. 67 and 68), minimum logic to perform the desired function can be derived. It should be noted, of course, that minimum logic need not be employed—logic involving an increased number of logic gates but performing the same desired function can also be employed. From the Karnaugh map shown in FIG. 67, the following equation can be derived:
<br> <i>D</i>0=<i>Q</i>1<i>+TX·Q</i>0<i>+En·TX </i> <br>
which can also be written as:
<br> <i>D</i>0=[<i>Q</i>1′·(<i>TX·Q</i>0)′·(<i>En·TX</i>)′]′<br>
where the symbol “+” represents a logical OR, the symbol “·” represents a logical AND, and the symbol “′” represents a logical NOT.
</p>
    <p num="p-0324">From the Karnaugh map shown in FIG. 68, the following equation can be derived:
<br> <i>D</i>1<i>=TX′·Q</i>1<i>·Q</i>0′+<i>En·TX′·Q</i>0′<br>
which can also be written as:
<br> <i>D</i>1=[(<i>TX′·Q</i>1<i>·Q</i>0′)′·(<i>En·TX′·Q</i>0′)′]′<br>
where the symbol “+” represents a logical OR, the symbol “·” represents a logical AND, and the symbol “′” represents a logical NOT.
</p>
    <p num="p-0325">Logic to implement these equations is shown in FIGS. 69 and 70.</p>
    <p num="p-0326">Paths shown in FIG. 64 are defined as follows:
<br>END<i>T=Q</i>1<i>′·Q</i>0<i>·TX′</i> <br>PumpUpSlow=<i>Q</i>1<i>·Q</i>0<i>′·TX</i>; and<br>PumpDownSlow=<i>Q</i>1′·<i>Q</i>0<i>·TX </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0327">Logic used to implement the state machine, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, is shown in FIGS. 8.0502AA-CD.</p>
    <p num="p-0328">A simplified timing diagram showing operation of the state machine is shown in FIG. 71. The crowding and separation of states in FIG. 71 is exaggerated to show the various modes of operation in a compact form. More particularly, it is highly unlikely that a pump down signal would be necessary so soon after a pump up signal as is depicted in FIG. 71.</p>
    <p num="p-0329">The state machine is trying to fit four cycles of the output of the voltage controlled oscillator in one chip width. Referring simultaneously to FIGS. 71 and 64, starting at the first occurrence of state <b>3</b> in FIG. 71,there is no transition, so the state machine will proceed to state <b>4</b> on the next clock. At state <b>4</b>, there is no transition, so the state machine will proceed to state <b>1</b> at the next clock. At state <b>1</b>, there is a transition in the waveform. The state machine always proceeds to state <b>2</b> from state <b>1</b>. At state <b>2</b>, there is no transition. From state <b>2</b>, the state machine proceeds to state <b>3</b>. This cycle is repeated and these paths are followed unless the clock recovery loop drifts off frequency.</p>
    <p num="p-0330">If the clock recovery loop drifts off frequency, other paths of the state diagram of FIG. 64 are followed. For example, if a transition is seen at state <b>4</b>, the voltage controlled oscillator is oscillating too slowly, and a PumpUpSlow is issued. The state machine skips state <b>1</b> and goes to state <b>2</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0331">If, after going from state <b>1</b> to state <b>2</b>, a transition is seen, the voltage controlled oscillator is oscillating too fast. The state machine will go from state <b>2</b> to state <b>2</b> so that state <b>2</b> is now in the proper position.</p>
    <p num="p-0332">If a transition is seen at state <b>3</b>, the voltage controlled oscillator may either be oscillating too fast or too slowly, so no pump up or pump down signals are issued. Instead, the state machine proceeds to state <b>2</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0333">The control functions performed by the start-up circuit and state machines can be used to control the frequency of any voltage controlled oscillator. The particular voltage controlled oscillator <b>702</b> that is employed in the illustrated embodiment is shown in FIGS. 8.0505AA-EF.</p>
    <p num="p-0334">In the illustrated embodiment, the voltage controlled oscillator <b>702</b> includes a current controlled four-stage ring oscillator shown in the center of FIGS. 8.0505AA-EF. The frequency of oscillation is very much linearly proportional to the bias current flowing in each stage.</p>
    <p num="p-0335">The voltage controlled oscillator <b>702</b> further includes an Operational Transconductance Amplifier shown on the left side of FIGS. 8.0505AA-EF. This Operational Transconductance Amplifier converts a voltage difference at its inputs to a current difference at its outputs. This Operational Transconductance Amplifier has a characteristic that is linear over a range of input voltage.</p>
    <p num="p-0336">The composite circuit is a voltage controlled oscillator <b>702</b> with nearly linear operation about the operating point of 38.15 MHz. The circuit shown to the right in FIGS. 8.0505AA-EF converts the small signal output of the oscillator to full digital levels.</p>
    <p num="p-0337">The input reference voltage is generated by a bandgap regulator and has a value of about 1.2 volts. The circuit is designed so that at nominal conditions the control node needs to pump to about equal to the reference voltage to oscillate at 38.15 MHz.</p>
    <p num="p-0338">The start-up circuit requires that the oscillator start at greater than half frequency (approximately 19 MHz) and less than full frequency over all operating conditions and for all process variations. This oscillator start frequency is set by providing an offset current to the bias of the oscillator which is not controlled by the input voltage. In the illustrated embodiment, the range of allowed offset currents is 7.437 μA to 9.763 μA. A value of 8.2 μA was chosen. Thus, the oscillator start frequency will vary from about 20 MHz to 34 MHz.</p>
    <p num="p-0339">The charge pump and loop filters <b>706</b> are shown in greater detail in FIGS. 8.0504AA-EE. The filter capacitors are shown on the right side of FIGS. 8.0504AA-EE. In the illustrated embodiment, the filter capacitors include a first group of ten capacitors, defining a total capacitance of 10 pF, and an second group of ten capacitors, defining a total capacitance of 10 pF. In FIGS. 8.0504AA-EE, the first group of ten capacitors is shown above the second group of ten capacitors. Other values or numbers are possible. In the illustrated embodiment, the lower group of capacitors is connected to the reference voltage input to the voltage controlled oscillator <b>702</b>. The upper group of capacitors is connected to the control node input of the voltage controlled oscillator <b>702</b>. The control node always starts at 0 Volts and is pumped up. The other (reference) side is always at the bandgap voltage.</p>
    <p num="p-0340">The charge pump is shown in the center of FIGS. 8.0504AA-EE. In the illustrated embodiment, there are actually four charge pumps. The method employed is to steer a current to charge or discharge the 10 pF capacitor for a prescribed period of time (one cycle of the recovered clock, in the illustrated embodiment). The change in control voltage for a single pump is:
<br>Δ<i>V</i>=(<i>I/C</i>)Δ<i>t </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0341">The lower three of the illustrated charge pumps are controlled by the start-up circuit <b>708</b> and can only pump up. The upper pump is controlled by the state machine <b>710</b> and can pump up or down in fine steps. The step sizes are controlled by the current value which is set accurately using a bandgap regulator to generate a reference current and using current mirrors to set the pump current. The step sizes used in the illustrated embodiment are shown in FIG. 72. Of course, other step sizes can be employed, as desired, and various numbers of different sized steps can be employed.</p>
    <p num="p-0342">The time used for the calculations for the coarse and medium cases is 40 ns, a typical value for the starting period of the oscillator. 26.2 ns is used for the medium fine and fine cases because these steps occur when the oscillator is close to its final frequency.</p>
    <p num="p-0343">The course and medium steps are controlled by the Puf<b>1</b> and Puf<b>2</b> outputs of the start-up circuit. More particularly, in the illustrated embodiment, the course steps are controlled by the PumpUpFast output of the start-up circuit “dcr_startup” shown in the detailed schematic drawings, and the medium step is controlled by the PumpUpMed output of the start-up circuit “dcr_startup” shown in the detailed schematic drawings. The medium fine step is also controlled by the PumpUpMed signal but the step size is reduced when the SDD (start data decode) signal is asserted indicating the oscillator is within a few percent of its final value. The fine step is controlled by the state machine and is used to “close in” on the final value.</p>
    <p num="p-0344">While this charge pump and loop filter configuration is advantageous for implementation on an integrated circuit, other configuration are possible. For example, simple RC filters can be employed.</p>
    <p num="h-0040">Details of Transmit Frequency Derivation from Incoming Data</p>
    <p num="p-0345">The illustrated embodiment has a loop filter including capacitors on respective control nodes “OUTN” and “OUTP” (shown in FIGS. 8.0504AA-EE) of the voltage controlled oscillator “vco.” In the illustrated embodiment, the loop filter capacitor on the control node “OUTP” is defined by a plurality of capacitors in parallel, and the loop filter capacitor on the control node “OUTN” is defined by a plurality of capacitors in parallel. The voltage on the respective control nodes is indicative of the frequency at which the voltage controlled oscillator “vco” is oscillating. After an entire incoming message has been received by the receiver “rx,” the control nodes and the capacitors on the control nodes are isolated from driving circuitry. The control voltage is thus stored in analog form on the capacitors, and the voltage controlled oscillator “vco” continues to oscillate at the recovered frequency. The length of time that the voltage stored on the capacitors is valid depends on leakage currents that can charge or discharge the capacitors over time.</p>
    <p num="p-0346">In the illustrated embodiment, such leakage currents are minimized by minimizing n+ and p+ active areas on the control node, and by minimizing drain to source voltages on devices connected to the control nodes. The values for the respective capacitors are chosen, in conjunction with loop filter requirements, to hold the control voltages for as long as possible as required before the device <b>12</b> transmits a reply to the received radio frequency command. This amount of time is approximately several hundred milliseconds in the illustrated embodiment.</p>
    <p num="p-0347">The output frequency of the voltage controlled oscillator can be multiplied up to generate a carrier frequency for the transmitter, as described elsewhere, or can be divided down to generate tones for FSK (frequency shift keyed) transmission or DPSK (differential phase shift keyed) transmission depending on what form of transmission is selected for the transmitter “tx.”</p>
    <p num="p-0348">In one embodiment, only one control node is employed; however, in the illustrated embodiment, a differential control node scheme is employed involving two control nodes “OUTN” and “OUTP.” Therefore, in the illustrated embodiment, a capacitor is provided on each control node, and control voltages are stored in analog form on these two capacitors.</p>
    <p num="p-0349">FIGS. 8.0504AA-EE provide a circuit drawing of the control voltage generator “dcr_vcocontrol.” The control voltage generator shows the control nodes for the voltage controlled oscillator. The control voltage generator is a differential circuit. The control nodes are shown on the right edge of FIGS. 8.0504AA-EE as “OUTP” and “OUTN,” where “OUTN” is actually tied to the band gap voltage, which is approximately 1.2 Volts. “OUTP” is the node that is pumped up to adjust frequency. The control voltage generator includes step size generators shown on the left half of FIGS. 8.0504AA-EE. The steps are achieved by conducting a current to the capacitor on the control node for a prescribed length of time. For a large step, a large current is applied to this capacitor. For a small step, a smaller current is applied to this capacitor. The capacitor on the control node “OUTP” is defined by ten capacitors in parallel in the illustrated embodiment.</p>
    <p num="p-0350">A similar capacitor, defined by ten capacitors in parallel, is provided on the other control node “OUTN.”</p>
    <p num="p-0351">Four different size currents are generated by fine, medium fine, medium, and coarse step generators “dcr_finestepgen,” “dcr_medfinestepgen,” “dcr_medstepgen,” and “dcr_coarsestepgen” respectively. The currents are either steered to the control capacitor on the control node or away from the capacitor, depending on whether there is a pump up or pump down command.</p>
    <p num="p-0352">FIGS. 8.050401AA-CK provide a circuit drawing showing construction details of the coarse step generator “dcr_coarsestepgen.” The coarse step generator includes a plurality of current mirrors.</p>
    <p num="p-0353">FIGS. 8.050402AA-CJ provide a circuit drawing showing construction details of the medium step generator “dcr_medstepgen.” The medium step generator includes a plurality of current mirrors.</p>
    <p num="p-0354">FIGS. 8.050403AA-BI provide a circuit drawing showing construction details of the medium fine step generator “dcr_medfinestepgen.” The medium fine step generator includes a plurality of current mirrors.</p>
    <p num="p-0355">FIGS. 8.050404AA-BB provide a circuit drawing showing construction details of a fine step controller “dcr_finestepctrl.”</p>
    <p num="p-0356">FIGS. 8.050405AA-EJ provide a circuit drawing showing construction details of the fine step generator “dcr_finestepgen.”</p>
    <p num="p-0357">FIGS. 8.0505AA-EF provide a circuit drawing of the voltage controlled oscillator “dcr_vco.” The voltage controlled oscillator “dcr_vco” is a four stage ring oscillator with differential stages. The voltage controlled oscillator includes an OTA (operational transconductance amplifier) shown on the left side of FIGS. 8.0505AA-DE. The OTA gives a linear relationship between the voltage differential at its inputs and the current at its output. The voltage controlled oscillator further includes current mirrors which mirror the current at the output of the OTA to drive the voltage controlled oscillator to change its frequency. The previously discussed control nodes (“OUTN” and “OUTP” of FIGS. 8.0504AA-EE) are shown coming in on the left side FIGS. 8.0505AA-DE, labelled as “INN” and “INP.” The voltage controlled oscillator further includes, at its output, a comparator type circuit that provides digital levels for the output of the voltage controlled oscillator “dcr_vco.”</p>
    <p num="p-0358">FIG. 8.0506AA-AB provide a circuit drawing of a clock generator “dcr_rxclkgen.” Different frequencies are needed for different functions. The clock generator provides outputs at different frequencies. For example, the clock generator provides an output “PROCCLK” (for the processor), an output “CHIPCLK” (chip clock); and outputs “PLLCLKP” and “PLLCLKN” for the clock that drives the state machine. The clock generator “dcr_rxclkgen” has an input “LOWRATE” for low rate which is a signal indicative that the chip is in low rate and can expect data to come in at a chip rate of one-half the normal chip rate. The loop is adjusted in a manner such that the frequency of “FMASTER” does not change regardless of whether the chip is in high rate or low rate. However, the clock “CHIPCLK” for the integrated circuit <b>16</b> is half as fast in low rate, and it takes twice as long to get data in as it would to get the same amount of data in at the high rate.</p>
    <p num="p-0359">FIG. 8.050601 provides a circuit drawing showing construction details of a flip-flop “dcr_rxclkgenff” included in the clock generator.</p>
    <p num="p-0360">FIGS. 8.0507AA-AB provide a circuit drawing of a non-overlapping clock generator “dcr_clkgen.” The non-overlapping clock generator receives as inputs true and compliment clock signals “ClkInP” and “ClkInN” and provides buffered true and compliment clock signals “ClkOut” and “ClkOutN.” The non-overlapping clock generator buffers the true and compliment clock signals “ClkInP” and “ClkInN” in such a way that before “ClkOut” can go high, “ClkOutN” must be low, and then at the end of that cycle, before “ClkOutN” can go high, “ClkOut” must be low. Any overlap between the two clocks occurs when they are both low. They are never both high at the same time. This is quite commonly required in many circuits throughout the integrated circuit <b>16</b> where shift register type techniques are used, and one stage passes information to another. Non-overlapping clocks are required for such functions.</p>
    <p num="p-0361">The circuit of FIGS. 6AA-EK further includes a transmitter “tx.” The transmitter “tx” is capable of transmitting using different modulation schemes, and the modulation scheme is selectable by the interrogator. More particularly, if it is desired to change the modulation scheme, the interrogator sends an appropriate command via radio frequency. The transmitter can switch between multiple available modulation schemes such as Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK), Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum, On-Off Keying (OOK), Amplitude Modulation (AM), and Modulated Backscatter (MBS).</p>
    <p num="p-0362">The output responses are included in packets that contain, in order of transmission, a preamble, a Barker code, and the reply data.</p>
    <p num="p-0363">In one embodiment, each bit of the radio frequency reply sent by the device <b>12</b> is modulated using a pseudo noise (PN) sequence for direct sequence spread spectrum communication. The sequence is generated in part by a linear feedback shift register “pngshr” having a plurality of registers “pngsreg.” In one embodiment, the linear feedback shift register is in the form [5,2] which means that the input to the first register is the result of combining the output of the fifth register by the exclusive-OR with the output of the second register. This produces thirty-one states. In one embodiment, the linear feedback shift register is in the form [6,1] for a sixty-three chip sequence. In another embodiment, the linear feedback shift register is in the form [8,4,3,2] for a two hundred and fifty-five chip sequence. In a preferred embodiment, the shift register is selectable between multiple of the above forms. In the form [6,1], the input to the first of six registers is the result of combining the output of the sixth register by exclusive-OR with the output of the first register. In the form [8,4,3,2], the input to the first of eight registers is the result of combining the outputs of registers eight, four, three, and two by exclusive-OR. The sixty-three chip output sequence requires less time for signal synchronization than the two hundred and fifty-five chip sequence. However, the two hundred and fifty-five chip output sequence provides better performance in systems having poor signal to noise ratio.</p>
    <p num="p-0364">FIGS. 8.06AA-ED provide a circuit drawing of the transmitter “tx.” FIGS. 8.06AA-ED show a transmitter PLL “txpllfsyn,” a test mode data selector “txdatasel,” a BPSK modulation driver “txbpsk,” a frequency doubler “txdoubler,” a second frequency doubler “txdoubler<b>2</b>,” a transmitter power amp “txpoweramp,” a transmitter bias generator “txbias,” and a modulated backscatter transmitter “txmbs.” FIGS. 8.06AA-ED actually shows two different transmitters. Much of FIGS. 8.06AA-ED illustrates circuitry employed for an active transmitter which is used in accordance with an alternative embodiment of the invention, but not in accordance with the preferred embodiment. FIGS. 8.06AA-ED also illustrate the modulated backscatter transmitter “txmbs” that is employed in a preferred embodiment. The active transmitter will be discussed first.</p>
    <p num="p-0365">In embodiment where the active transmitter is employed, the active transmitter operates by taking the “FMASTER” clock that was recovered from the incoming data stream and using a phase locked loop “txpllfsyn” (an analog phase locked loop in the illustrated embodiment) to multiply up the frequency. In the illustrated embodiment, the frequency is multiplied up by a factor of sixteen from 38 MHZ to 610 MHZ. The phase locked loop includes an oscillator that generates eight phases which are 45° out of phase with respect to each other. The eight phases generated by the oscillator are applied to first doubler circuits “txdoubler” and “txdoubler<b>2</b>” in order to generate the proper phased outputs at double the frequency that then again serve as inputs to the other doubler circuit. The active transmitter further includes a transmitter power amp “txpoweramp.” The transmitter power amp includes the other doubler that receives the outputs of the first doubler circuits “txdoubler” and “txdoubler<b>2</b>.” Capability for several different modulation techniques is provided for the active transmitter. One such modulation technique is BPSK where the phase of the carrier (2.44 GHz in the illustrated embodiment) is inverted to indicate a bit change. Another such modulation technique is amplitude modulation (AM). In the illustrated embodiment, 100% modulation, or on/off keying, is employed with the amplitude modulation.</p>
    <p num="p-0366">FIGS. 8.0601AA-BB provide a circuit drawing of the transmitter phase locked loop “txpllfsyn.” The phase locked loop “txpllfsyn” includes a voltage controlled oscillator “txvco” that receives an analog tune voltage and provides an output frequency in accordance with the analog tune voltage. The phase locked loop further includes a divider “txdivider” which receives the output signal of the voltage controlled oscillator “txvco” and divides the frequency of the output of the oscillator “txvco” by a factor of sixteen. It will be understood that this division ratio of sixteen is for an exemplary embodiment, and the scope of the present invention encompasses other division ratios. The phase locked loop “txpllfsyn” includes a phase/frequency detector “txpfdet.” At the phase/frequency detector “txpfdet,” the output of the divider “txdivider” is compared to the signal received at the reference input of the detector, which reference input, in accordance with one embodiment, is the signal “FMASTER” recovered from the incoming data stream. The phase/frequency detector “txpfdet” compares the fed back signal (i.e., having a frequency of the voltage controlled oscillator “txvco” divided by sixteen) with the signal received at the reference input and puts out a pump up signal “PU” or pump down signal “PD” in accordance with phase and frequency difference therebetween. The phase locked loop “txpllfsyn” further includes a charge pump “txchgpump.” The pump up signal “PU” or pump down signal “PD” put out by the phase/frequency detector “txpfdet” drive the charge pump “txchgpump.” The phase locked loop “txpllfsyn” further includes a loop filter “txloopfilter” that receives an output signal from the charge pump “txchgpump” and filters this output signal for providing the tune voltage for controlling the voltage controlled oscillator “txvco.” The filter “txloopfilter” removes transients and establishes loop dynamics, i.e. responsiveness, of the resulting phase locked loop.</p>
    <p num="p-0367">Again, the voltage controlled oscillator provides an output signal having a frequency proportional to the tune voltage received at its input. When the phase locked loop is locked, the frequency and phase of the signal fed back to the phase/frequency detector is equal to the frequency and phase of the reference input signal. Therefore, the output frequency of the voltage controlled oscillator “txvco” is equal to N times the frequency of the reference signal, where N is equal to the division factor of the divider. For the exemplary embodiment described above, N is equal to sixteen and the output frequency of the voltage controlled oscillator “txvco” is equal to sixteen times the frequency of the reference signal, e.g. 16×38.15 MHZ=610.45 MHZ. By providing various output taps distributed along a ring topology of the voltage controlled oscillator “txvco,” output signals of different phase relationships (but of equal frequency) are obtained from the voltage controlled oscillator “txvco.” In a preferred embodiment, eight separate output taps from the voltage controlled oscillator “txvco” provide eight different output signals having substantially 45° differences in phase therebetween, e.g., 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, and 315°. Thus, in the illustrated embodiment, the voltage controlled oscillator “txvco” generates eight phases spaced 45°.</p>

    <p num="p-0372">The voltage controlled oscillator “txvco” comprises a ring oscillator having four stages. FIG. 32 is a simplified schematic illustrating one stage <b>104</b>. Four such stages are connected in a chain, with the outputs of the chain connected to the inputs of the chain, to define the ring oscillator. The stage <b>104</b> includes a p-channel transistor <b>105</b> having a gate defining a control node “V control,” having a source connected to a supply voltage “V+,” and having a drain; and a p-channel transistor <b>106</b> having a gate connected to the control node “V control,” having a source connected to the supply voltage “V+,” and having a drain. The stage <b>104</b> further includes an n-channel transistor <b>107</b> having a gate defining an input “IN P,” a drain connected to the drain of the transistor <b>105</b> and defining a node “B,” and a source; and an n-channel transistor <b>108</b> having a gate defining an input “IN N,” a drain connected to the drain of the transistor <b>106</b> and defining a node “A,” and a source. The stage <b>104</b> further includes an ideal current source <b>109</b> connected to the sources of the transistors <b>107</b> and <b>108</b> and directing current from the sources of the transistors <b>107</b> and <b>108</b> to ground. The stage <b>104</b> further includes a resistor <b>110</b> connected between the voltage “V+” and the drain of the transistor <b>107</b>, and a resistor <b>111</b> connected between the voltage “V+” and drain of the transistor <b>108</b>. The stage <b>104</b> further includes a source follower <b>112</b> including an n-channel transistor <b>113</b> having a gate connected to the node “A,” having a drain connected to a supply voltage “V+,” and having a source defining an output “OUT P”; and an ideal current source <b>114</b> connected to the source of the transistor <b>113</b> and directing current from the source of the transistor <b>113</b> to ground. The stage <b>104</b> further includes a source follower <b>115</b> including an n-channel transistor <b>116</b> having a gate connected to the node “B,” having a drain connected to the supply voltage “V+,” and having a source defining an output “OUT N”; and an ideal current source <b>117</b> connected to the source of the transistor <b>116</b>. A source follower is a circuit where the signal at the source terminal of a transistor is approximately equal to the signal at the gate of the transistor. The source followers <b>112</b> and <b>115</b> are provided in the stage <b>104</b> to provide the necessary drive for the outputs “OUT P” and “OUT N” to drive a load. More particularly, the outputs “OUT P” and “OUT N” drive amplifiers that drive frequency doublers described elsewhere herein. Nodes “A” and “B” are connected to another stage in the chain (e.g., by connecting the nodes “A” and “B” to inputs “IN P” and “IN N” of a subsequent stage).</p>
    <p num="p-0373">The ideal current source <b>109</b> drives a current “IBIAS,” and the values of the resistors <b>110</b> and <b>111</b> and of “IBIAS” are chosen such that transistors <b>107</b> and <b>108</b> are in saturation. More particularly, the values of the resistor <b>110</b> and the current “IBIAS” are chosen such that the value of the resistance of resistor <b>110</b> multiplied by the current “IBIAS” is less than a maximum voltage (e.g. 800 mV) to cause saturation of transistor <b>107</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, resistors <b>110</b> and <b>111</b> have the same resistance value. The resistors <b>110</b> and <b>111</b> are made from n-well, n+, p+, or polysilicon depending on the process used to manufacture the integrated circuit <b>16</b>. Parasitic capacitance on nodes A and B is minimized by compact arrangement of the components of the stage <b>104</b>. Computer software, such as from Cadence, can also be employed to reduce parasitic capacitance.</p>
    <p num="p-0374">The stage <b>104</b> provides a differential amplifier capable of switching at a very high frequency. The switching frequency is adjustable by adjusting the voltage at control node “V control.” More particularly, as the voltage at the control node “V control” decreases, the p-channel transistors <b>105</b> and <b>106</b> become more conductive, and there is less impedance between the supply voltage “V+,” and the drains of the transistors <b>107</b> and <b>108</b>. This provides for a faster switching rate. There is a linear change in frequency versus the voltage at the control node “V control” for at least some range of voltages.</p>

    <p num="p-0380">Analog multipliers are known in the art. An analog multiplier includes two inputs, and includes an output providing a signal that is representative of a multiplication of one of the inputs with the other of the inputs. One known analog multiplier is known as a Gilbert multiplier cell. For a detailed discussion of Gilbert cells, see <i>Four Quadrant Multiplier</i>, B. Gilbert, IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits, 1968, pp. 365-373. Such Gilbert multiplier cells are also described in detail in <i>Analysis and Design of Analog Integrated Circuits</i>, Paul R. Gray and Robert G. Meyer, Third Edition, 1993, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., pp. 667-681. Such Gilbert multiplier cells include two cross-coupled, emitter-coupled pairs of bipolar junction transistors in series with an emitter coupled pair of bipolar junction transistors. A Gilbert multiplier cell employing bipolar junction transistors produces an output that is the hyperbolic tangent of two input voltages. This is because a characteristic of bipolar junction transistors is exponential non-linearity. If the input voltages are sufficiently low, the hyperbolic tangent function can be approximated as linear, and the circuit behaves as a multiplier which multiplies together the two input voltages.</p>
    <p num="p-0381">The multiplier cell originally developed by Gilbert employed bipolar junction transistors. It is also known to employ MOS transistors to produce a Gilbert multiplier cell.

    <p num="p-0387">It is known to use a Gilbert cell to multiply together sine waves of different phases to produce a doubled frequency (FIGS. 34 and 35). This is based on a known trigonometric relationship:
<br>sin 2Θ=2 sin Θ cos Θ<br>
Signals that are 180° apart are applied to the first and second input nodes, and a phase shifter produces 90° shifted signals that are applied to the third and fourth input nodes. However, in such embodiments, an integrator is required, and the phase shifter is required to be feedback controlled, because slight errors in the required 90° phase shift would otherwise cause the output signals to have different average values and different amplitudes as shown in FIG. 33. FIG. 33 is a waveform diagram illustrating the effect of errors in frequency doubler circuits that necessitates correction, such as by using an integrator and feedback. FIG. 34 is a circuit schematic illustrating a frequency doubler circuit that employs an integrator and feedback to solve the problem illustrated in FIG. 33. FIG. 35 is a waveform diagram illustrating input and output waves created and employed by a frequency doubler circuit such as the one shown in FIG. 34.
</p>
    <p num="p-0388">It is desirable to avoid the need for feedback. Frequency multiplier circuits employing feedback are susceptible to being disturbed. For example, if substrate noise or an adjacent line switches and causes a shift at the integrator, the output will be distorted from the desired output until the integrator has a chance to recover. The integrator can take a long time to recover. Therefore, it is desirable to eliminate feedback loops from a frequency multiplier.</p>

This provides for flexibility in that different antenna configurations are possible, separate antennas can be used for the detector <b>84</b> and transmitter <b>330</b>, if desired, an external amplifier can be used to amplify the output of the transmitter <b>330</b>, etc.</p>
    <p num="p-0416">The detector and transmitter do not operate simultaneously.</p>
    <p num="p-0417">In one embodiment, the integrated circuit <b>16</b> further includes a pull up transistor <b>336</b> connected to the cathode of the Schottky diode <b>86</b> and configured to connect the cathode to the bias voltage (Vdd) when the transmitter is operating. The pull up transistor <b>336</b> can be included if necessary so the detector does not interfere with the transmitter <b>330</b> while the transmitter <b>330</b> is transmitting.</p>
    <p num="p-0418">By using a common antenna for the active transmitter and the Schottky diode detector, space savings are achieved.</p>
    <p num="p-0419">The active transmitter <b>330</b> is shown in greater detail in FIG. 51. The active transmitter includes a differential pair <b>338</b> of transistors driven by the frequency doubler. The function of the differential pair <b>338</b> is to steer current to the antenna <b>44</b> or away from the antenna <b>44</b>. If bi-phase modulation is employed, the differential pair <b>338</b> steers one phase or the other phase to the antenna <b>44</b>. More particularly, if bi-phase modulation is employed, then a signal on line “ENABLEAM” (see FIGS. 8.06AA-ED, and 8.0605AA-AB to 8.0608AA-BB) is low and the leftmost of three current steering transistors (sources connected to the current source) is off because its gate is low. Current is then steered to the antenna by the transistor shown on the right. Its phase is determined in an earlier stage. The other phase is present in the middle transistor. When data is reversed the current phases switch sides in response to the earlier stage. If amplitude modulation is employed, the differential pair either sends current to the antenna <b>44</b>, or is sends none to provide on/off keying. More particularly, in the amplitude modulation mode, a signal on line “ENABLEAM” is high and current is steered to the antenna by the transistor shown to the right if a signal on line “AMDATA” is high, and the current is steered to Vdd (not to the antenna) if the signal on line “AMDATA” is low.</p>

The transmitter power amplifier includes the differential pair of transistors, shown on the right side of FIGS. 8.0606AA-IE, driven by the frequency doubler. The differential pair steers current to the antenna or away from the antenna, as described above. If bi-phase modulation is employed, the differential pair steers one phase or the other phase to the antenna. If amplitude modulation is employed, the differential pair either sends current to the antenna, or it sends none to provide on/off keying.</p>

    <p num="p-0422">FIG. 52 provides a simplified circuit schematic showing an antenna <b>350</b> being shared by the backscatter transmitter and the Schottky diode detector <b>84</b>, in a manner similar to the antenna sharing possibility described in connection with FIGS. 50-51. The Schottky diode detector <b>84</b> was described above in detail in connection with FIG. 29, like reference numerals indicating like components.</p>
    <p num="p-0423">In the illustrated embodiment, the antenna <b>350</b> is a loop antenna and has one end connected to a bias voltage (Vdd) and has another end connected to the detector <b>84</b> via a detector input illustrated as RXANT in FIG. 52. For antenna sharing with a backscatter transmitter, capacitors <b>352</b> and <b>354</b> external of the integrated circuit <b>16</b> are employed, as illustrated in FIG. 52, to isolate the antenna from the backscatter antenna driver when the detector is using the antenna.</p>
    <p num="p-0424">The detector and transmitter do not operate simultaneously.</p>
    <p num="p-0425">By using a common antenna for the backscatter transmitter and the Schottky diode detector, space savings are achieved.</p>
    <p num="p-0426">In an alternative embodiment shown in FIG. 53, a single antenna <b>350</b> is shared by the detector <b>94</b> (shown in FIG. 30 and described elsewhere herein) and a backscatter transmitter. An n-channel transistor <b>356</b> is provided having power electrodes connected to opposite ends of the antenna, and having a control electrode connecting to transmitter modulation circuitry. The control electrode is held low when the antenna is being used by the receiver.</p>
    <p num="p-0427">FIGS. 8.0608AA-BB provide a circuit drawing of a modulated backscatter transmitter “txmbs.” The modulated backscatter transmitter “txmbs” includes circuitry that creates non-overlapping drive signals. The modulated backscatter transmitter “txmbs” includes primary antenna ports “BS<b>1</b>” and “BS<b>2</b>.” Each of these antenna ports is intended to be connected to one-half of a dipole antenna having a length appropriate for the transmission frequency. In the illustrated embodiment, the halves of the dipole antenna have respective sizes appropriate for 2.44 Ghz. The halves of the dipole antenna are not included on the integrated circuit <b>16</b>, in the illustrated embodiment, but are instead provided “off chip.” Other antenna arrangements are possible.</p>
    <p num="p-0428">The modulated backscatter transmitter “txmbs” further includes an n-channel transistor marked 900 micron in FIGS. 8.0608AA-BB, and two n-channel pull-up transistors marked 100 micron and respectively connected between a voltage vdd! and the 900 micron transistor. When the gate of the transistor marked 900 micron is high, then the two dipole halves are shorted together with a fairly low impedance (e.g., on the order of 15 Ohms, plus any bond wire impedance that might be present depending on how the device is packaged). The antenna becomes substantially similar to a single half-wavelength antenna. In a backscatter mode, when the two halves of the antenna are shorted together, the antenna reflects a portion of the power being transmitted by the interrogator. In the other state, the gate of the 900 micron transistor is low. The 900 micron transistor is then off, but the two 100 micron transistors that pull up the voltage vdd! are on, lifting antenna ports “BS<b>1</b>” and “BS<b>2</b>” both up to a voltage of vdd! minus an n-channel Vt. The two antenna ports “BS<b>1</b>” and “BS<b>2</b>” are then isolated from each other by an open circuit. This isolation changes the radar cross-section of the dipole antenna dramatically from when the two halves are shorted together. The antenna becomes substantially similar to two quarter wavelength antennas. In a Backscatter mode, when the two halves of the antenna are isolated, the antenna reflects very little of the power transmitted by the interrogator.</p>
    <p num="p-0429">The modulated backscatter transmitter “txmbs” further includes cross-coupled circuitry shown near the middle in FIGS. 8.0608AA-BB. The cross-coupled circuitry is provided to make sure that both the pull up transistors and the shorting device are not on at the same time.</p>
    <p num="p-0430">The modulated backscatter transmitter “txmbs” further includes another antenna port “BS<b>3</b>” that is intended to be used when the integrated circuit <b>16</b> is packaged in the standard SOIC package. The antenna port “BS<b>3</b>” provides another option for configuring a backscatter antenna. The antenna port “BS<b>3</b>” supplies a one milliamp current and can drive an external PIN diode that would be situated between the two halves of the dipole antenna or any other suitable antenna. The other side of that external PIN diode can be returned to either the antenna port “BS<b>1</b>” or “BS<b>2</b>.” Because PIN diodes are good shorting and opening devices for backscatter applications, the transmission range of a device <b>12</b> built with the integrated circuit <b>16</b> can be extended over the range that is obtained using only the internal circuitry of the integrated circuit <b>16</b>. This is at the expense of the need for an external component and an accompanying increase in cost of the device <b>12</b>.</p>

The power up detector “pup” puts out a master reset pulse upon power up. The power up detector also puts out another pulse that lasts throughout a power up cycle in which the processor performs operations appropriate upon power up, the last operation being to reset the wake up pulse. The random number clock generator “reg” generates random numbers for use in arbitration schemes and generates a pseudo-random sequence. The master bias source “mbs” includes a band gap regulator. The voltage regulators “vrg” and “vrgtx” generate supply voltages for various blocks of circuitry. The bias OK circuit “biasok” determines when the regulator voltage has reached a final level, and then enables the circuitry that is driven by the regulator.</p>
    <p num="h-0045">Details of Low Battery Detection</p>
    <p num="p-0434">The integrated circuit <b>16</b> includes a differential I/O op-amp or comparator comparing the voltage of the battery with a predetermined voltage (e.g., with band gap voltage). A low battery signal is generated if the voltage of the battery is less than the predetermined voltage. More particularly, one of the status registers is a battery status register and has a value indicating if the voltage of the battery is less than the predetermined voltage. The transmitter “tx” transmits the value of this battery status register via radio frequency when responding to commands from the interrogator. In the illustrated embodiment, a battery voltage detector is shown in FIGS. 16 (and in FIGS. 11 and 9.010304AA-BB); however, the battery voltage detector can be provided in a different location of the integrated circuit <b>16</b>.</p>

    <p num="p-0444">FIGS. 9.02AA-DK provide a circuit drawing of a Vdd power up detector “pup” included in the analog processor. The power up detector puts out a master reset pulse upon power up. The power up detector also puts out another pulse that extends throughout a power up cycle while the processor performs a number of operation, the last one of which is to reset the wake up pulse. The power up detector uses a thermal voltage generator, which is a circuit such as is used for the low power current controlled oscillator, described above. The thermal voltage generator generates a small current. The power up circuit “pup” further includes current mirrors, and a capacitor illustrated near the top center of FIGS. 9.02AA-DK. The current mirrors mirror the small current generated by the thermal voltage generator. The mirrored current holds down one side of the capacitor illustrated near the top center of FIGS. 9.02AA-DK. When the power supply first rises from zero to its final value, whatever that might be (e.g., 3 Volts or 5 Volts), the capacitor couples up the bottom plate causing a signal to rise on a line “PWRUP.” The small mirrored current then slowly discharges the bottom plate until “PWRUP” switches back low. A signal from before the final inverter producing “PWRUP” goes down to circuitry shown on the lower right of FIGS. 9.02AA-DK. That circuitry provides a hard pull down on the bottom of the capacitor to impede any switching back and forth. After the “PWRUP” pulse, the circuitry switches the bottom of the capacitor back down to ground much more rapidly than the small mirrored currents could. The circuitry then resets so that the only thing left holding the bottom of the capacitor low is the small current mirrored from the thermal voltage generator. The power up detector also generates another pulse on a line “WAKEUP” shown on the right of FIGS. 9.02AA-DK. This pulse goes high at the same time as the pulse on line “PWRUP” but does not come down at the same time. Instead, the pulse on the line “WAKEUP” does not come down until the processor issues a wake up acknowledge signal on line “WUACK.” The processor does not issue the wake up acknowledge signal until completion of running of a wake up program stored in the ROM.</p>

    <p num="p-0449">FIGS. 9.04AA-CE provide a circuit drawing of the voltage regulator “vrg” included in the analog processor. The voltage regulator includes an op-amp having an input receiving a reference voltage “VREF” (which is approximately 1.2 Volts). The voltage regulator further includes a large p-channel device driven by the output of the op-amp. In the illustrated embodiment, the p-channel device is made up of a plurality of p-channel devices connected together in parallel. The voltage regulator further includes an output node “VREG” driven by the plurality of p-channel devices. The voltage regulator further includes a resistor divider, shown along the middle of the right side of FIGS. 9.04AA-CE, connected to the output “VREG.” The resistor divider includes a fifty percent point (having a voltage of half of the voltage at the output node “VREG”) that is fed back to another input of the op-amp so that the voltage at the output node “VREG” is required to be two times the input voltage “VREF” to complete the feedback. In the illustrated embodiment, a number of individual regulators are employed in order to isolate power supplies to different areas of the circuit. However, in alternative embodiments, a reduced number of voltage regulators are employed.</p>

    <p num="h-0046">Details of Low Power Pseudo Random Number Generator</p>
    <p num="p-0456">The device includes a random clock generator “reg” including a linear feedback shift register “rcg_osc” that has a plurality of stages and that generates a pseudo-random sequence. The random clock generator “reg” includes an oscillator “rcg_osc” that supplies clock signals to the linear feedback shift register. The device includes a low current generator, such as a thermal voltage generator, to drive the oscillator that supplies clock signals to the linear feedback shift register. The shift register has two modes of operation; namely, a low power mode, and a high power mode. The random clock generator includes current mirrors referenced to the low current generator. In the low power mode, the current to each stage of the shift register is limited by the current mirrors. In the high power mode, the current mirror device gates are driven to full supply voltages. This allows the shift register to operate at a higher frequency appropriate for shifting the random number into the processor.</p>
    <p num="p-0457">This technique is illustrated, with reference to an inverter, in a simplified schematic in FIG. 37. FIG. 37 shows a circuit including series connected p-type transistors <b>210</b> and <b>212</b>, and series connected n-type transistors <b>214</b> and <b>216</b> which are connected in series with the p-type transistors <b>210</b> and <b>212</b>. The transistors <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>, and <b>216</b> are connected between a positive voltage “V+” and ground.

    <p num="p-0458">When “V BIAS N” and “V BIAS P” are controlled by a low current mirror (low power mode), the turn-on voltages of transistors <b>210</b> and <b>216</b> are small and current through inverter transistors <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> is limited. When “V BIAS N” is pulled to “V+” and “V BIAS P” is pulled to ground, the inverter operates at full speed.</p>
    <p num="p-0459">FIGS. 9.09AA-BB provide a circuit drawing showing construction details of the random clock generator “reg” included in the analog processor. The random clock generator “rcg” includes a low power oscillator and bias generator “rcg_osc.” The random clock generator “reg” further includes the linear feedback shift register “rcg_sreg.” The random clock generator “rcg” further includes a clock generator “rcg_clkgen” which generates non-overlapping versions of the clock which drives the linear feedback shift register “rcg_osc.” The linear feedback shift register “rcg_osc” generates the pseudo-random sequence. The random clock generator further includes circuitry (shown below the linear feedback shift register in FIGS. 9.09AA-BB) for switching between clock schemes. This circuitry includes an n-channel device and a p-channel device (shown as circles with x's through them in FIGS. 9.09AA-BB) allowing connection or blocking connection between the input and the output of the devices. The alternate clock sources are state one “S<b>1</b>,” state three “S<b>3</b>,” and phase two “P<b>2</b>” from the processor clock. The shift register is operable in a high power mode and in a very low power mode. When the processor wants a random number from the shift register “rcg_osc,” these clocks are used and the shift register is operated in the high power mode to shift eight bits at a time in serial fashion into the processor. A total of sixteen bits are transferred, so two transfers of eight bits each take place. At other times, the shift register is in the very low power mode and is driven by the clock generated by the low power oscillator. In this manner, the shift register “rcg_osc” sequences through its pseudo-random sequence continuously in the background until the shift register is called upon to provide a number.</p>
    <p num="p-0460">FIGS. 9.0901AA-CH provide a circuit drawing showing construction details of the linear feedback shift register “rcg_sreg” included in the random clock generator. In the illustrated embodiment, the linear feedback shift register “rcg_sreg” is a [17,3] shift register having an output in register seventeen. The input to the first register is the exclusive-or of registers seventeen and three. The linear feedback shift register “rcg_sreg” includes seventeen stages, so it produces a sequence of 2<sup>−17</sup>−1. Therefore, the odds of two devices <b>12</b> being at the same place in the sequence are low.</p>
    <p num="p-0461">FIGS. 9.090101AA-CC provide a circuit drawing showing construction details of a shift register zero bit “rcg_sregbit<b>0</b>” included in the linear feedback shift register. This bit is different from others so that it can power up in a particular state. The shift register will function to deliver a sequence of pseudo-random numbers as long as all registers are not allowed to go to zero. Therefore, the zero bit “rcg_sregbit<b>0</b>” of the shift register is altered to guarantee that it will be a one on power up. The shift register bit “rcg_sregbit<b>0</b>” shown in FIGS. 9.090101AA-CC also includes a series of n-channel and p-channel devices to limit current in the logic gates. When the random clock generator is in the low power mode, the bias voltages on these series devices allow only very small currents; however, when the random clock generator is operating in the high power mode (when the processor is shifting in a random number) then these nodes are driven to full supply. A line “BIASN” will be driven to Vdd, and a line “BIASP” will be driven to ground. Then the logic of the random clock generator operates in a normal mode.</p>

    <p num="p-0466">The PN processor “pnproc” shown in FIGS. 10AA-DD includes a digital PN correlator “dcorr.” The correlator receives a data stream on line “RXCHIPS” that comes from the receiver. The correlator has a thirty-one chip register and performs a comparison of the chip pattern of the incoming data stream with the expected thirty-one chip pattern. When there is a total or near match, the correlator “dcorr” puts out a high signal (a one) on line “RXDATA.” When there is a nearly total mismatch, the correlator “dcorr” puts out a low signal (a zero) on line “RXDATA.” Every thirty-one chips, “RXDATA” either changes state or does not change state, depending on whether the PN sequence was inverted or not inverted (i.e., depending on whether a zero or one was defined by the thirty-one chip sequence). The output of the correlator “dcorr” on line “RXDATA” is a sequence of true, non-encoded, data bits of ones and zeros.</p>
    <p num="p-0467">The PN processor further includes a PN lock detector “pnlockdet.” The lock detector is a circuit that determines whether a preamble is present. In the illustrated embodiment, the preamble is all zeros. Therefore, the lock detector “pnlockdet” determines whether or not a certain length of zeros have occurred in a row. In the illustrated embodiment, the lock detector “pnlockdet” determines whether or not four zeros occurred in a row. The lock detector “pnlockdet” has an output that is connected to the serial input output circuit “sio” in the processor, and enables the processor to look for the Barker or start code.</p>
    <p num="p-0468">The PN processor further includes a clock “pngclk.” The clock “pngclk” is a clock generator that is based on a clock signal “CHIPCLK” produced by the digital clock and data recovery circuit “dcr.” The clock “pngclk” puts out non-overlapping true and compliment versions of the clock and these are used to drive circuitry in the PN processor.</p>
    <p num="p-0469">The PN processor further includes a shift register “pngshr.” The shift register is a block of logic that can be used to generate a thirty-one chip sequence, a sixty-three chip sequence, and a two hundred and fifty-five chip sequence. A thirty-one chip sequence is always used for receiving, but for transmitting multiple selections are available. In the illustrated embodiment, the integrated circuit <b>16</b> is wired to allow a selection between thirty-one and sixty-three chips. In alternative embodiments, it can be wired to allow a selection between thirty-one and two hundred and fifty-five chips, or between thirty-one and sixty-three chips. In the receive mode, the PN sequence is not used explicitly, except that the middle chip and the last chip in the sequence are detected, and those signals are used by circuitry labelled “Bit Rate Clock Generator” in FIGS. 10AA-DI to generate a bit rate clock for the transmitter and receiver. Thus, the output of this shift register “pngshr” is used to generate a bit rate clock, on line “TRCLK.” In the transmit mode, if a modulation scheme has been selected that uses spread spectrum encoding, the output of this shift register is used to encode the data.</p>
    <p num="p-0470">The PN processor further includes a differential and PN encoder “dpenc.” The differential encoder performs differential encoding and PN encoding. The differential encoder includes an input connected to a line “TXDATA.” The data on line “TXDATA” is differential encoded by the differential encoder, if differential encoding is selected. Both polarities of differential encoding are provided for and are selected depending on the desired modulation scheme. The differential and PN encoder can also impress the PN code on the data “TXDATA” if this is selected.</p>
    <p num="p-0471">The PN processor further includes a PSK/FSK generator “fskgen.” In the illustrated embodiment, PSI (phase shift keying) is performed by the PSK/FSK generator “fskgen.” In an alternative embodiment, FSK (frequency shift keying) is performed by the PSK/FSK generator “fskgen.” The generator “fskgen” has both a last chip complement output “FSKLASTCHIP” and a mid chip complement output “FSKMIDCHIP.” These outputs are connected to the bit rate clock generator and override the outputs from the PN generator shift register “pngshr”. The bit rate clock generator then generates the appropriate bit rate clock.</p>
    <p num="p-0472">The PN processor further includes D type flip-flops “pnddff,” one of which is included in the bit rate clock generator.</p>
    <p num="p-0473">The PN processor further includes circuitry shown on the lower right in FIGS. 10AA-DD that provides for test modes. This circuitry provides a way to bring a modulating signal for the transmitter out to a digital pad “DIGTXOUT” depending on whether an enable signal is placed on an enable pin “DIGTX.” The enable signal on enable pin “DIGTX” is also used, in connection with a signal on line “ForceRXON” to force the receiver to receive in a continuous fashion. The output of the receiver is routed to a line “TESTRXDATA” and that signal is routed to a digital output pad (the digital pad “DIGTXOUT” in the illustrated embodiment).</p>
    <p num="p-0474">FIGS. 10.01AA-DJ provide a circuit drawing showing construction details of the digital PN correlator “dcorr” included in the PN processor. The correlator “dcorr” includes a bias generator “dcor_bias” that generates bias currents for other circuitry included in the correlator. The correlator “dcorr” further includes a shift register “dcorr_sreg.” The shift register “dcorr_sreg” performs a chip by chip comparison between the incoming data stream and the expected thirty-one chip PN sequence. For each chip that agrees, the shift register “dcorr_sreg” puts out a current on a line “Iagree.” For each chip that is in disagreement, the shift register “dcorr_sreg” puts out a current on a line “Idisagree.” Currents are added for each of the thirty-one chips on these lines “Iagree” and “Idisagree.” The PN correlator “dcorr” further includes two comparator structures shown in the middle of FIGS. 10.01AA-DJ as an upper comparator and a lower comparator. The upper comparator has current biasing defining a threshold, and the lower comparator has current biasing defining a threshold. When a sufficient number of currents flow from the shift register “dcorr_sreg” into the “Iagree” line to overcome the threshold set by the current biasing in the upper comparator, a one is detected, and the circuit puts out a digital one. If, on the other hand, the currents in the “Idisagree” line are high enough to overcome the threshold set by the current biasing in the lower comparator, a zero is detected, and the circuit puts out a digital zero. In other cases, the output does not change. The correlator further includes circuitry shown on the right of FIGS. 10.01AA-DJ that synchronizes the data stream out of the correlator and into other information processing circuitry.</p>

The circuitry encodes data such that zeros in the incoming data cause the output to transition from either zero to one or one to zero, and ones in the incoming data cause the output not to transition. Other forms of differential encoding can be performed. For example, the circuitry can encode data such that ones in the incoming data cause the output to transition from either zero to one or one to zero, and zeros in the incoming data cause the output not to transition. A selection of one of these two forms of differential encoding is performed by placing a high or low signal on a selection line “DIFFSEL.” Whether or not differential encoding takes place at all is also selectable.

In one embodiment, battery voltage is compared to band gap voltage (produced by the band gap reference generator) using an op-amp. In one embodiment, the battery I/O buffer “batalg” is used to connect a voltage to the analog to digital converter; however, in the illustrated embodiment, this function is performed by a circuit “tsn.” The circuit “tsn” includes an enable line, and includes a resistor divider. When an enable signal is placed on the enable line, the resistor divider is tapped, and the output of the resistor divider goes to an op-amp for comparison with band gap voltage.</p>
    <p num="p-0490">In order to detect a low battery voltage, circuitry is provided which defines what is a low voltage. The lowest possible value at which an indication is given that the battery voltage is low is the value at which the integrated circuit <b>16</b> begins to fail to operate properly.

For example, in one embodiment, the margin is 0.1 Volts. The circuitry “tsn.” is therefore set up with a voltage divider having a tap compared to the band gap voltage.

    <p num="p-0491">FIGS. 12AA-AB provide a circuit drawing of a digital I/O pad buffer “paddig” included in the integrated circuit <b>16</b>. The digital I/O pad buffer is both an input and output buffer. The I/O pad buffer “paddig” has an input “DPAD” which is connected to a bond pad of the integrated circuit <b>16</b>. Data entering the pad buffer “paddig” from the input “DPAD” passes through an ESD protection device “esd<b>1</b>” and then passes on to whatever circuit for which it is an input (there are many such pad buffers “paddig” in the illustrated embodiment). Data to be output via the pad buffer “paddig” comes into the pad buffer “paddig” via a line “DOUT” along with an enable on line “ENABLE.” The pad buffer “paddig” includes a static pull down device shown on the far right in FIGS. 12AA-AB. The pad buffer “paddig” further includes n-channel and p-channel transistors shown in the right in FIGS. 12AA-AB proximate the static pulldown device. If an enable signal is present on line “ENABLE” and “DOUT” is high, the two p-channel devices will turn on and pull the output pad “DPAD” high.

    <p num="h-0047">Details of RF Selectable Return Link</p>
    <p num="p-0494">The return link configuration logic “rlconfig” provides for user customization of operation of the transmitter “tx.” Various customizations are possible. For example, the transmitter “tx” is selectable as operating in a backscatter transmit mode, or an active transmit mode in response to a command from the interrogator <b>26</b>. This is shown in FIGS. 21 and 22. FIG. 21 is a simplified circuit schematic illustrating a transmitter “tx” switchable between an active mode and a backscatter mode, and employing separate antennas As<b>1</b> and As<b>2</b> for the active-mode and the backscatter mode, respectively. If the active mode is selected, the micro controller connects the antenna As<b>1</b> to transmit the output of the transmitter, using switch S<b>1</b>. If the backscatter mode is selected, the micro controller <b>34</b> connects the antenna As<b>2</b> to transmit the output of the transmitter, using switch S<b>2</b>. In an alternative embodiment, shown in FIG. 22, the transmitter “tx” is still switchable between an active mode and a backscatter mode, but employs the same antenna <b>46</b> for both the active mode and the backscatter mode.</p>
    <p num="p-0495">If the backscatter mode is selected, the interrogator <b>26</b> sends a continuous unmodulated RF signal while the transmitter “tx” transmits a response to a command from the interrogator <b>26</b>. The clock recovered from the incoming message is used to derive a subcarrier for the transmitter “tx.” In the illustrated embodiment, the subcarrier for the transmitter “tx” is a square wave subcarrier. The response to the interrogator is modulated onto the square wave subcarrier by the device <b>12</b> using a selected modulation scheme. For example, the response can be modulated onto the subcarrier using Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), or Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK).</p>
    <p num="p-0496">If the active transmit mode is selected, the transmitter <b>32</b> is selectable as using amplitude modulation, or bi-phase (Binary Phase Shift Keying) modulation. The transmitter <b>32</b> is selectable as using differential coding, and/or spread spectrum coding. There are various combinations of options that can be selected through the commands that are sent to the integrated circuit <b>16</b> by the interrogator <b>26</b>. The transmitter <b>32</b> is selectable as using the thirty-one chip spread spectrum sequence, or a narrow band.</p>
    <p num="p-0497">These options provide for a wide range of possible applications or uses for the integrated circuit <b>16</b>, and provide for the possibility of using different schemes in an application for different purposes. For example, an active transmit can be selected for certain purposes, while a backscatter transmit can be selected for different purposes.</p>
    <p num="p-0498">FIGS. 15AA-BC provide a circuit drawing of return link configuration control logic “rlconfig.” The return link configuration control logic “rlconfig” has inputs “TXSEL<b>0</b>,” “TXSEL<b>1</b>,” and “TXSEL<b>2</b>.” The values on these inputs are defined by a radio frequency command sent by the interrogator. These inputs “TXSEL<b>0</b>,” “TXSEL<b>1</b>,” and “TXSEL<b>2</b>” are connected to the outputs of an output register “oreg” included in the processor. The return link configuration logic takes each possible combination of inputs “TXSEL<b>0</b>,” “TXSEL<b>1</b>,” and “TXSEL<b>2</b>” (there are a total of 2×2×2=8 possible combinations) and asserts appropriate control signals to enable the desired return link configuration. The signals being controlled by the return link configuration control logic “rlconfig” are: “ENDIL” for enabling the data interleaver; “PNOFF” for selecting whether or not PN encoding is employed for data transmitted by the device <b>12</b>; “DIFFSEL” for selecting which polarity of differential encoding is used for transmitted data; “DIFFON” for selecting whether or not differential encoding is employed for transmitted data; and “ENFSK” for selecting FSK (or PSK in an alternative embodiment) for transmitted data; “BSCAT” for enabling backscatter for transmitted data; and “ENABLEAM” enables amplitude modulation.</p>
    <p num="p-0499">The integrated circuit <b>16</b> further includes a number of sensors, such as sensors “batalg,” “tsn,” and “mag,” in the embodiments where an A/D converter is included in the analog processor “anlgproc.” The sensor “batalg” is a battery voltage detector, the sensor “tsn” is a temperature sensor, and the sensor “mag” is a magnetic sensor. These sensors will be connected to the A/D converter in the analog processor “anlgproc” in one embodiment of the invention.

    <p num="p-0500">Using such sensors, the device <b>12</b> can monitor things such as its own battery voltage, its temperature and detect the presence of a magnetic field. There are various possible uses for information sensed by such sensors. For example, events can be counted so that, depending on the user's application, the user can determine whether or how many times a certain item was exposed to temperature above or below a certain value (e.g., to determine likelihood of spoilage or damage). Alternatively, the user can determine whether or how many times a certain item was exposed to a magnetic field of a certain value (e.g., when passing a certain location).</p>

In the illustrated embodiment, the integrated circuit <b>16</b> includes a standard 20 lead SOIC package; however, any appropriate integrated circuit package can be employed.</p>
    <p num="p-0513">Connections to these pads are brought out of the package and are accessible to the user. In this way, the user can somewhat tailor the function of the integrated circuit <b>16</b> to their application. In one embodiment, however, the entire device <b>12</b> is encapsulated in a housing such as that shown in FIG. 3.</p>
    <p num="p-0514">The pads P and Q are digital port data and clock pads, and work together to provide a serial input or output, or a digital connection outside the integrated circuit. For example, if desired, data can be transmitted to the integrated circuit <b>16</b> via radio frequency, and a response can be put out on the digital port data pad, or vice versa.</p>
    <p num="p-0515">The pad R is a chip enable pad, and prevents wake up to look for an incoming radio frequency signal. There are some applications or uses where the user knows that there will be certain periods of time when no valid radio frequency signals will be presented to the integrated circuit <b>16</b>. The user will want to prevent the integrated circuit <b>16</b> from leaving the sleep mode so that power can be saved, and the life of the battery <b>18</b> can be extended.</p>
    <p num="p-0516">The pad S is a test mode pad for testing. When the integrated circuit <b>16</b> is powered on (i.e., when power is first applied), if that pad is held high then the micro controller <b>34</b> goes into a self-test mode. After the self-test, if the pad S is no longer held high, the integrated circuit <b>16</b> goes to the sleep mode, and periodically awakens to look for valid radio frequency signals, as it normally would. This pad S is useful to the manufacturer of the integrated circuit <b>16</b>, such as for testing prior to packaging the die of the integrated circuit <b>16</b> in the housing of the integrated circuit <b>16</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0517">The pad T is a digital transmit pad, and the pad U is a digital transmit data pad. These pads are useful for testing. They allow the integrated circuit <b>16</b> to operate in its intended manner, except that, if the pad T is held high, data from the integrated circuit <b>16</b> is brought out as a digital signal on the pad U instead of being transmitted via radio frequency using transmitter “tx.”</p>
    <p num="p-0518">If the pad I is held high, data to the integrated circuit <b>16</b> is brought in as a digital signal on the pad H instead of being received via radio frequency using receiver “rx”. Details of the logic associated with this function are included in the FIG. 8.01 in connection with lines “DIGRX” (associated with pad I) and “DIGRXDATA” (associated with pad H). This logic includes the NAND gates and invertors shown leading from the lines “DIGRX” and “DIGRXDATA” to a line “DataIn.”</p>
    <p num="p-0519">These pads T, U, I, and H provide for testing of most functions of the integrated circuit <b>16</b> without the need to use high frequency radio signals. High frequency radio signals may not always be convenient in a testing lab. The pads T and U do not provide for testing of some functions relating to radio frequency transmission, and the pads I and H do not provide for testing of some functions relating to radio frequency reception (e.g., operation of the Schottky detector). These pads T, U, V, and H do provide for testing of the spread spectrum processing circuit <b>40</b>, and for processing of protocol commands described in the appended microfiche. This allows everything but operation of radio frequency transmitter <b>32</b> and receiver <b>30</b> to be checked prior to proceeding with that radio frequency testing. It also provides a function for the user, in that the integrated circuit <b>16</b> does not necessarily need to be used as a radio frequency identification device. The integrated circuit <b>16</b> has a receiver, and a transmitter, and it can be used for various purposes, such as an actuator or beacon. If it is not necessary to have a radio transmission or reception of data, either one or both form of data can be passed directly through the pads in digital form.</p>
    <p num="p-0520">Note that there are separate enables T and I associated with transmitting or receiving digital data. For example, if the digital transmit pad T is taken high, then the transmitter “tx” will not cause a radio frequency signal to travel to antenna <b>46</b> but instead outgoing responses will come out on the pad U. However, the receiver “rx” will operate normally unless the digital receive pad I is taken high.</p>
    <p num="p-0521">The pad V is a TX clock pad, or transmit clock pad. Pad V was intended to be an external input that could be used for a clock for the transmitter <b>32</b> instead of the clock recovered from the incoming signal. In some applications, it may be necessary to have a clock that is more stable than the recovered clock, and the pad V provides a way for the user to supply such a clock. For example, the user may connect a crystal oscillator, external to the integrated circuit <b>16</b>, and that way achieve a very stable carrier frequency for the transmitter “tx.” In the illustrated embodiment, pad V has been reconnected to provide a signal which can be used to activate an external, high performance radio.</p>
    <p num="p-0522">The pads Y, Z, AA, A, and D are antenna pads for connecting the receiver <b>30</b> and transmitter <b>32</b> to the shared antenna <b>14</b> or the multiple antennas <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>. In the preferred embodiment, circuitry that interfaces these pads is physically located on the die next to these pads. More particularly, the microwave outputs of the transmitter <b>32</b> are arranged on the die so as to be next to (in close physical proximity to) the appropriate bond pads.</p>
    <p num="p-0523">The pad B is a test RX or test receive pad, and the pad C is a test TX or test transmit pad. Because the integrated circuit <b>16</b> is usually in the sleep mode, but wakes up briefly to look for a valid incoming radio frequency signal, and then goes back to sleep, it can be difficult to test the receiver “rx” and the transmitter “tx.” Therefore the pads B and C provide for forcing on the receiver “rx” and transmitter “tx,” respectively, such as for testing. If a high signal is applied to the pad B, this forces the receiver “rx” to remain on. Similarly, if a high signal is applied to the pad C, this forces the transmitter “tx” to remain on.</p>
    <p num="p-0524">If the pad B is used to force the receiver on in order to exercise the circuitry, such as through clock recovery, an input radio frequency signal is required at the appropriate frequency (e.g., 2.45 GHz) modulated with the spread spectrum code.</p>
    <p num="p-0525">The pad E is a RX input or receive input pad. This pad is connected to a side of the Schottky detector where the base band signal is available. This pad is provided for test purposes and to allow the use of a high-performance Schottky diode external to the integrated circuit <b>16</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0526">The pad G is a VSS A pad, or analog VSS pad. The pad G is a connection to a ground bus that only goes to the analog circuitry.</p>

    <p num="h-0049">Details of Arbitration</p>
    <p num="p-0661">The arbitration of multiple interrogators per device <b>12</b> is a detection method based upon each interrogator using a unique interrogator ID (InterrId). The InterrId is sent to a device <b>12</b> in a command. The device <b>12</b> also stores an interrogator ID TagStoredInterrId. The TagStoredInterrId is only updated by a WriteTagRegsXXX command. A RcvdInterrId is included in replies from a device <b>12</b>. If a TagStoredInterrId does not match the RcvdInterrId then the tag will not respond with a reply.</p>
    <p num="p-0662">The arbitration of more than one tag per interrogator <b>26</b> is accomplished by using an ArbitrationValue and an ArbitrationMask during an Identify command. Contained within each device <b>12</b> is a random value ID (RandomValueId) and an arbitration lockout (IDENTIFY_LOCKOUT) bit. The RandomValueId is set to a “random” binary number upon command by an interrogator. It may also be set by an Identify command setting a SELECT_RANDOM_VALUE bit in SubCmnd.</p>
    <p num="p-0663">The following examples use a 1-byte ArbitrationValue for simplicity. If an interrogator <b>26</b> transmits an Identify command with its ArbitrationMask set to 0000 0000 (binary), all devices <b>12</b> in the receiving range will respond. If there is only one device <b>12</b>, communications may proceed between the interrogator <b>26</b> and device <b>12</b>. If there are multiple devices <b>12</b> responding, the interrogator <b>26</b> will detect a collision and will start the arbitration sequence. To start the arbitration sequence among multiple tags, the interrogator <b>26</b> instructs the tags to clear their IDENTIFY_LOCKOUT bit and (possibly) re-randomize their RandomValueId values. The ArbitrationValue 0000 0000 and ArbitrationMask 0000 0001 are then transmitted to all devices <b>12</b> in range. The devices <b>12</b> perform a logical ANDing (masking) of the ArbitrationMask and the RandomValueId. If the result matches the ArbitrationValue sent by the interrogator <b>26</b>, the device or devices <b>12</b> will reply to the Identify command. If not, the interrogator <b>26</b> will increment the ArbitrationValue to 0000 0001 and try again.</p>
    <p num="p-0664">The interrogator <b>26</b> then checks each of the possible binary numbers (0000 0000 and 0000 0001 in this case) in the expanded mask (0000 0001) for a response by a device <b>12</b>. If a single device <b>12</b> responds to one of these values, the interrogator <b>26</b> will reply by commanding it to set its lockout bit. If any collisions are detected at this mask level, the mask would be widened again by one bit, and so on through the eight bit wide mask (256 numbers). If no collisions are detected for a particular ArbitrationValue and ArbitrationMask combination, the TagId returned in the reply is used for direct communication with that particular device <b>12</b>. During the arbitration sequence with up to about one hundred devices <b>12</b>, the mask will eventually grow large enough such that all devices <b>12</b> can respond without collision. After the mask widens to four or five bits, more devices <b>12</b> have unique random numbers and single tag replies are received. Thus with each expansion of the ArbitrationMask, there are fewer and fewer tags left to Identify.</p>
    <p num="p-0665">With a large number of tags in range, it is possible that several devices <b>12</b> will choose the same value for their RandomValueId. In this case, the complete mask will be used. Collisions will still occur and the remaining tags will be instructed to select a new Random ValueId. If an application dictates, for example, that one hundred tags will usually be present in range of the interrogator <b>26</b>, it would be advantageous to start with the mask set to eight bit wide (11111111) and count up through 256 instead of starting with the mask set at 0000 0000, followed by 0000 0001, 0000 0011, etc. Other arbitration schemes can be implemented by the user.</p>
    <p num="h-0050">Applications</p>
    <p num="p-0666">There are a large number of possible applications for devices such as the device <b>12</b>. Because the device <b>12</b> includes an active transponder, instead of a transponder which relies on magnetic coupling for power, the device <b>12</b> has a much greater range.</p>
    <p num="p-0667">One application for devices <b>12</b> is inventory control to determine the presence of particular items within a large lot of products.</p>
    <p num="p-0668">Another application for devices <b>12</b> is electronic article surveillance (EAS). The devices <b>12</b> can be attached to retail items in a store having an interrogator <b>26</b> at the exits, for detection of unauthorized removal of retail items. The merchant can deactivate or remove devices <b>12</b> from retail items for which proper payment has been made.</p>
    <p num="p-0669">Another application for devices <b>12</b> is to track migration of animals.</p>
    <p num="p-0670">Another application for devices <b>12</b> is to counteract terrorism by monitoring luggage entering a plane to ensure that each item of luggage that enters the plane is owned by a passenger who actually boards the plane. The devices <b>12</b> can also be used to monitor luggage to locate lost luggage.</p>
    <p num="p-0671">The device <b>12</b> can be use to track packages, such as courier packages.</p>
    <p num="p-0672">The device <b>12</b> can be used to track hazardous chemicals or waste to ensure that it safely reaches a proper disposal site.</p>
    <p num="p-0673">The device <b>12</b> can be used for security purposes, to track personnel within a building. The device <b>12</b> can also be used for access control.</p>
    <p num="p-0674">The device <b>12</b> can be used to monitor and manage freight transit. For example, interrogators <b>26</b> can be placed at the entrance and exit of a terminal (e.g., a rail or truck terminal), to monitor incoming and outgoing shipments of vehicles bearing the devices <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0675">The device <b>12</b> can be used to impede car theft. A European anti-theft directive (74/61/EEC) provides that all new car models sold after January 1997 must be fitted with electronic immobilizers and approved alarm systems. The devices <b>12</b> can be provided on keychains or within car keys, and interrogators <b>26</b> placed in cars, so that the vehicle will be inoperable unless the specified device <b>12</b> for a specific car is used. The interrogator <b>26</b> can control the door locks of a car, or the ignition of the car, or both. Because the device <b>12</b> includes memory, the interrogator <b>26</b> in the car can periodically automatically change values in the device <b>12</b> (like changing a password).</p>
    <p num="p-0676">Devices <b>12</b> can be placed in cars and used in connection with electronic toll collections systems. Because the devices <b>12</b> can be used to identify the respective cars in which they are placed, interrogators <b>26</b> in toll plazas can charge appropriate accounts based on which cars have passed the toll plaza.</p>
    <p num="p-0677">Devices <b>12</b> can be placed in cars and used in connection with parking systems. Because the devices <b>12</b> can be used to identify the respective cars in which they are placed, interrogators <b>26</b> in parking areas can determine when a vehicle arrives and leaves a parking area.</p>
    <p num="p-0678">The devices <b>12</b> can be used for inventory control of rental equipment.</p>
    <p num="p-0679">The devices <b>12</b> can be used where bar code labels will not properly work because of harsh environmental conditions (e.g., grease, dirt, paint).</p>
    <p num="p-0680">In compliance with the statute, the invention has been described in language more or less specific as to structural and methodical features. It is to be understood, however, that the invention is not limited to the specific features shown and described, since the means herein disclosed comprise preferred forms of putting the invention into effect. The invention is, therefore, claimed in any of its forms or modifications within the proper scope of the appended claims appropriately interpreted in accordance with the doctrine of equivalents.</p>
