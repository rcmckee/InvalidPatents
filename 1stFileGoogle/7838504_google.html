    <heading>FEDERALLY-SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT</heading> <p num="p-0003">This invention was made with Government support under contract AI47365 awarded by the National Institutes of Allergies and Infectious Diseases. The Government has certain rights in this invention.</p>
    <heading>INTRODUCTION</heading> <heading>Background of the Invention</heading> <p num="p-0004">Viral infections are a continuing medical problem because, like any rapidly-dividing infectious agent, there are continuing mutations that help some sub-populations of viruses continue to be resistant to current treatment regimens. Many virally-based diseases do not have effective anti-viral treatments, because such treatments address the symptoms of the viral disease and not the root cause of the disease. There is a need in the art to discover and develop new anti-viral therapies.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small RNA molecules, approximately 21-22 nts in length, that have been detected in many plant and animal species. Even certain animal viral RNA genomes have been found to encode miRNAs. Cloning efforts and computational predictions have indicated that there are likely to be over 200 miRNA-encoding genes in humans, which can regulate approximately 1000-2000 mRNAs. Certain miRNAs are expressed ubiquitously, whereas others are expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner. For example, miR-122 was noted to be specifically expressed in the liver, where it constitutes 70% of the total miRNA population.</p>

    <p num="p-0021">As summarized above, the subject invention provides methods and compositions reducing the amount of a target viral genome in a target cell. In further describing the subject invention, the subject methods are described first in greater detail, followed by a review of various representative applications in which the subject invention finds use as well as kits that find use in practicing the subject invention.</p>
    <p num="h-0009">Methods</p>
    <p num="p-0022">As indicated above, the subject invention provides methods of reducing the amount of a target viral genome in a target cell, where the target cell may be present in vitro or in vivo. By “reducing the amount of” is meant that the level or quantity of the target viral genome in the target cell is reduced by at least about 2-fold, usually by at least about 5-fold, e.g., 10-fold, 15-fold, 20-fold, 50-fold, 100-fold or more, as compared to a control, i.e., an identical target cell not treated according to the subject methods.</p>
    <p num="p-0023">In practicing the subject methods, an effective amount of a miRNA (microRNA) inhibitory agent is introduced into the target cell, where any convenient protocol for introducing the agent into the target cell may be employed. The miRNA inhibitory agent is an agent that inhibits the activity of a target miRNA in the target cell. The target miRNA is a miRNA whose presence is associated with viral genome replication and abundance in the target cell. As is known in the art, miRNAs are single stranded RNA molecules that range in length from about 20 to about 25 nt, such as from about 21 to about 24 nt, e.g., 22 or 23 nt. The target miRNAs may or may not be completely complementary to a region of the same length as the miRNA in the target viral genome. If not completely complementary, the miRNA and its corresponding target viral genome are at least substantially complementary, such that the amount of mismatches present over the length of the miRNA, (ranging from about 20 to about 25 nt) will not exceed about 8 nt, and will in certain embodiments not exceed about 6 or 5 nt, e.g., 4 nt.</p>
    <p num="p-0024">By miRNA inhibitory agent is meant an agent that inhibits the activity of the target miRNA. The inhibitory agent may inhibit the activity of the target miRNA by a variety of different mechanisms. In certain embodiments, the inhibitory agent is one that binds to the target miRNA and, in doing so, inhibits its activity. Representative miRNA inhibitory agents include, but are not limited to: antisense oligonucleotides, such as the specific antisense oligonucleotides reported in the experimental section below, and the like. Other agents of interest include, but are not limited to: Naturally occurring or synthetic small molecule compounds of interest include numerous chemical classes, though typically they are organic molecules, preferably small organic compounds having a molecular weight of more than 50 and less than about 2,500 daltons. Candidate agents comprise functional groups necessary for structural interaction with proteins, particularly hydrogen bonding, and typically include at least an amine, carbonyl, hydroxyl or carboxyl group, preferably at least two of the functional chemical groups. The candidate agents often comprise cyclical carbon or heterocyclic structures and/or aromatic or polyaromatic structures substituted with one or more of the above functional groups. Candidate agents are also found among biomolecules including peptides, saccharides, fatty acids, steroids, purines, pyrimidines, derivatives, structural analogs or combinations thereof. Such molecules may be identified, among other ways, by employing appropriate screening protocols.</p>
    <p num="p-0025">Also of interest in certain embodiments are RNAi agents. In representative embodiments, the RNAi agent targets the precursor molecule of the microRNA, known as pre-microRNA molecule. By RNAi agent is meant an agent that modulates expression of microRNA by a RNA interference mechanism. The RNAi agents employed in one embodiment of the subject invention are small ribonucleic acid molecules (also referred to herein as interfering ribonucleic acids), i.e., oligoribonucleotides, that are present in duplex structures, e.g., two distinct oligoribonucleotides hybridized to each other or a single ribooligonucleotide that assumes a small hairpin formation to produce a duplex structure. By oligoribonucleotide is meant a ribonucleic acid that does not exceed about 100 nt in length, and typically does not exceed about 75 nt length, where the length in certain embodiments is less than about 70 nt. Where the RNA agent is a duplex structure of two distinct ribonucleic acids hybridized to each other, e.g., an siRNA (such as d-siRNA as described in copending application Ser. No. 60/377,704; the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference), the length of the duplex structure typically ranges from about 15 to 30 bp, usually from about 15 to 29 bp, where lengths between about 20 and 29 bps, e.g., 21 bp, 22 bp, are of particular interest in certain embodiments. Where the RNA agent is a duplex structure of a single ribonucleic acid that is present in a hairpin formation, i.e., a shRNA, the length of the hybridized portion of the hairpin is typically the same as that provided above for the siRNA type of agent or longer by 4-8 nucleotides. The weight of the RNAi agents of this embodiment typically ranges from about 5,000 daltons to about 35,000 daltons, and in many embodiments is at least about 10,000 daltons and less than about 27,500 daltons, often less than about 25,000 daltons.</p>
    <p num="p-0026">In certain embodiments, instead of the RNAi agent being an interfering ribonucleic acid, e.g., an siRNA or shRNA as described above, the RNAi agent may encode an interfering ribonucleic acid, e.g., an shRNA, as described above. In other words, the RNAi agent may be a transcriptional template of the interfering ribonucleic acid. In these embodiments, the transcriptional template is typically a DNA that encodes the interfering ribonucleic acid. The DNA may be present in a vector, where a variety of different vectors are known in the art, e.g., a plasmid vector, a viral vector, etc.</p>
    <p num="p-0027">As indicated above, the miRNA inhibitory agent can be introduced into the target cell(s) using any convenient protocol, where the protocol will vary depending on whether the target cells are in vitro or in vivo.</p>
    <p num="p-0028">Where the target cells are in vivo, the miRNA agent can be administered to the host using any convenient protocol. In embodiments where the inhibitory agent is a nucleic acid, the protocol employed is typically a nucleic acid administration protocol, where a number of different such protocols are known in the art. The following discussion provides a review of representative nucleic acid administration protocols that may be employed. The nucleic acids may be introduced into tissues or host cells by any number of routes, including viral infection, microinjection, or fusion of vesicles. Jet injection may also be used for intra-muscular administration, as described by Furth et al. (1992), <i>Anal Biochem </i>205:365-368. The nucleic acids may be coated onto gold microparticles, and delivered intradermally by a particle bombardment device, or “gene gun” as described in the literature (see, for example, Tang et al. (1992), <i>Nature </i>356:152-154), where gold microprojectiles are coated with the DNA, then bombarded into skin cells. Expression vectors may be used to introduce the nucleic acids into a cell. Such vectors generally have convenient restriction sites located near the promoter sequence to provide for the insertion of nucleic acid sequences. Transcription cassettes may be prepared comprising a transcription initiation region, the target gene or fragment thereof, and a transcriptional termination region. The transcription cassettes may be introduced into a variety of vectors, e.g. plasmid; retrovirus, e.g. lentivirus; adenovirus; and the like, where the vectors are able to transiently or stably be maintained in the cells, usually for a period of at least about one day, more usually for a period of at least about several days to several weeks.</p>
    <p num="p-0029">For example, the inhibitory agent can be fed directly to, injected into, the host organism containing the target gene. The agent may be directly introduced into the cell (i.e., intracellularly); or introduced extracellularly into a cavity, interstitial space, into the circulation of an organism, introduced orally, etc. Methods for oral introduction include direct mixing of RNA with food of the organism. Physical methods of introducing nucleic acids include injection directly into the cell or extracellular injection into the organism of an RNA solution. The agent may be introduced in an amount which allows delivery of at least one copy per cell. Higher doses (e.g., at least 5, 10, 100, 500 or 1000 copies per cell) of the agent may yield more effective inhibition; lower doses may also be useful for specific applications.</p>
    <p num="p-0030">In certain embodiments, a hydrodynamic nucleic acid administration protocol is employed. Where the agent is a ribonucleic acid, the hydrodynamic ribonucleic acid administration protocol described in detail below is of particular interest. Where the agent is a deoxyribonucleic acid, the hydrodynamic deoxyribonucleic acid administration protocols described in Chang et al., J. Virol. (2001) 75:3469-3473; Liu et al., Gene Ther. (1999) 6:1258-1266; Wolff et al., Science (1990) 247: 1465-1468; Zhang et al., Hum. Gene Ther. (1999) 10:1735-1737: and Zhang et al., Gene Ther. (1999) 7:1344-1349; are of interest.</p>
    <p num="p-0031">Additional nucleic acid delivery protocols of interest include, but are not limited to: those described in U.S. Patents of interest include U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,985,847 and 5,922,687 (the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference); WO/11092; Acsadi et al., New Biol. (1991) 3:71-81; Hickman et al., Hum. Gen. Ther. (1994) 5:1477-1483; and Wolff et al., Science (1990) 247: 1465-1468; etc.</p>
    <p num="p-0032">Depending n the nature of the inhibitory agent, the active agent(s) may be administered to the host using any convenient means capable of resulting in the desired reduction of target viral genome amount or load in the target cell. Thus, the agent can be incorporated into a variety of formulations for therapeutic administration. More particularly, the agents of the present invention can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions by combination with appropriate, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents, and may be formulated into preparations in solid, semi-solid, liquid or gaseous forms, such as tablets, capsules, powders, granules, ointments, solutions, suppositories, injections, inhalants and aerosols. As such, administration of the agents can be achieved in various ways, including oral, buccal, rectal, parenteral, intraperitoneal, intradermal, transdermal, intracheal, etc., administration.</p>
    <p num="p-0033">In pharmaceutical dosage forms, the agents may be administered alone or in appropriate association, as well as in combination, with other pharmaceutically active compounds. The following methods and excipients are merely exemplary and are in no way limiting.</p>
    <p num="p-0034">For oral preparations, the agents can be used alone or in combination with appropriate additives to make tablets, powders, granules or capsules, for example, with conventional additives, such as lactose, mannitol, corn starch or potato starch; with binders, such as crystalline cellulose, cellulose derivatives, acacia, corn starch or gelatins; with disintegrators, such as corn starch, potato starch or sodium carboxymethylcellulose; with lubricants, such as talc or magnesium stearate; and if desired, with diluents, buffering agents, moistening agents, preservatives and flavoring agents.</p>
    <p num="p-0035">The agents can be formulated into preparations for injection by dissolving, suspending or emulsifying them in an aqueous or nonaqueous solvent, such as vegetable or other similar oils, synthetic aliphatic acid glycerides, esters of higher aliphatic acids or propylene glycol; and if desired, with conventional additives such as solubilizers, isotonic agents, suspending agents, emulsifying agents, stabilizers and preservatives.</p>
    <p num="p-0036">The agents can be utilized in aerosol formulation to be administered via inhalation. The compounds of the present invention can be formulated into pressurized acceptable propellants such as dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, nitrogen and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0037">Furthermore, the agents can be made into suppositories by mixing with a variety of bases such as emulsifying bases or water-soluble bases. The compounds of the present invention can be administered rectally via a suppository. The suppository can include vehicles such as cocoa butter, carbowaxes and polyethylene glycols, which melt at body temperature, yet are solidified at room temperature.</p>
    <p num="p-0038">Unit dosage forms for oral or rectal administration such as syrups, elixirs, and suspensions may be provided wherein each dosage unit, for example, teaspoonful, tablespoonful, tablet or suppository, contains a predetermined amount of the composition containing one or more inhibitors. Similarly, unit dosage forms for injection or intravenous administration may comprise the inhibitor(s) in a composition as a solution in sterile water, normal saline or another pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p>
    <p num="p-0039">The term “unit dosage form,” as used herein, refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human and animal subjects, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of compounds of the present invention calculated in an amount sufficient to produce the desired effect in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier or vehicle. The specifications for the novel unit dosage forms of the present invention depend on the particular compound employed and the effect to be achieved, and the pharmacodynamics associated with each compound in the host.</p>
    <p num="p-0040">The pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, such as vehicles, adjuvants, carriers or diluents, are readily available to the public. Moreover, pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents, stabilizers, wetting agents and the like, are readily available to the public.</p>
    <p num="p-0041">Those of skill in the art will readily appreciate that dose levels can vary as a function of the specific compound, the nature of the delivery vehicle, and the like. Preferred dosages for a given compound are readily determinable by those of skill in the art by a variety of means.</p>
    <p num="p-0042">Introduction of an effective amount of an RNAi agent into a mammalian cell as described above results in a modulation of target gene(s) expression, e.g., a reduction of target gene(s) expression, as described above.</p>
    <p num="p-0043">The above described methods work in any mammalian cell, where representative mammal cells of interest include, but are not limited to cells of: ungulates or hooved animals, e.g., cattle, goats, pigs, sheep, etc.; rodents, e.g., hamsters, mice, rats, etc.; lagomorphs, e.g., rabbits; primates, e.g., monkeys, baboons, humans, etc.; and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0044">The compositions may be advantageously combined and/or used in combination and/or alternation with other antiviral agents which are either therapeutic or prophylactic agents, and different from the subject compounds. The compositions may also be advantageously combined and/or used in combination with agents that treat conditions often associated with the viral infections that are sensitive to the present compounds, such as anti-HCV agents or immunosuppressive agents. In certain embodiments, administration in conjunction with the subject compositions enhances the efficacy of such agents. Accordingly, the present compounds, when combined or administered in combination with other antiviral agents, can be used in certain embodiments in dosages which are less than the expected amounts when used alone, or less than the calculated amounts for combination therapy.</p>
    <p num="p-0045">Exemplary treatment options for hepatitis C (HCV) include interferons, e.g., interferon alfa-2b, interferon alfa-2a, and interferon alfacon-1. Less frequent interferon dosing can be achieved using pegylated interferon (interferon attached to a polyethylene glycol moiety which significantly improves its pharmacokinetic profile). Combination therapy with interferon alfa-2b (pegylated and unpegylated) and ribavarin has also been shown to be efficacious for some patient populations. Other agents currently being developed include RNA replication inhibitors (e.g., ViroPharma's VP50406 series), antisense agents, therapeutic vaccines, protease inhibitors, helicase inhibitors and antibody therapy (monoclonal and polyclonal).</p>

    <p num="p-0048">The subject methods find use in the treatment of a variety of different conditions in which the reduction of a target viral genome amount in a target cell or host comprising the same is desired. In many embodiments, the subject methods find use in the treatment of a host suffering from a viral mediated disease condition. By treatment is meant that at least an amelioration of the symptoms associated with the condition afflicting the host is achieved, where amelioration is used in a broad sense to refer to at least a reduction in the magnitude of a parameter, e.g. symptom, associated with the condition being treated. As such, treatment also includes situations where the pathological condition, or at least symptoms associated therewith, are completely inhibited, e.g. prevented from happening, or stopped, e.g. terminated, such that the host no longer suffers from the condition, or at least the symptoms that characterize the condition.</p>
    <p num="p-0049">A variety of hosts are treatable according to the subject methods. Generally such hosts are “mammals” or “mammalian,” where these terms are used broadly to describe organisms which are within the class mammalia, including the orders carnivore (e.g., dogs and cats), rodentia (e.g., mice, guinea pigs, and rats), and primates (e.g., humans, chimpanzees, and monkeys). In many embodiments, the hosts will be humans.</p>
    <p num="p-0050">As indicated above, the methods may be employed for any viral genome whose abundance in a target cell correlates with a miRNA in that cell. In certain embodiments, the viral genome is a genome of virus having an RNA genome, where the virus may be from the family Flaviviridae, e.g., a hepacivirus, such as a hepatitis C virus, e.g., Hepatitis C virus (isolate 1), Hepatitis C virus (isolate BK), Hepatitis C virus (isolate EC1), Hepatitis C virus (isolate EC10), Hepatitis C virus (isolate HC-J2), Hepatitis C virus (isolate HC-J5), Hepatitis C virus (isolate HC-J6), Hepatitis C virus (isolate HC-J7), Hepatitis C virus (isolate HC-J8), Hepatitis C virus (isolate HC-JT), Hepatitis C virus (isolate HCT18), Hepatitis C virus (isolate HCT27), Hepatitis C virus (isolate HCV-476), Hepatitis C virus (isolate HCV-KF), Hepatitis C virus (isolate Hunan), Hepatitis C virus (isolate Japanese), Hepatitis C virus (isolate Taiwan), Hepatitis C virus (isolate TH), Hepatitis C virus isolate H, Hepatitis C virus type 1, Hepatitis C virus type 10, Hepatitis C virus type 2, Hepatitis C virus type 3, Hepatitis C virus type 4, Hepatitis C virus type 5, Hepatitis C virus type 6, Hepatitis C virus type 7, Hepatitis C virus type 8, etc.</p>

    <p num="p-0069">The following examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation.</p>
    <heading>EXPERIMENTAL</heading> <heading>I. Results &amp; Discussion</heading> <p num="p-0070">To begin to understand the roles of miR-122 in regulating mRNA function, we monitored the expression of miR-122 in RNA samples extracted from liver tissues and liver cell lines. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows that miR-122 could be detected in mouse and human liver, and in cultured human liver Huh7 cells, but not in human cervical carcinoma-derived HeLa cells, or even in human liver-derived HepG2 cells (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>).</p>
    <p num="p-0071">It is known that hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA that carries adaptive mutations can replicate in Huh7 but not in HepG2 cells, and we wanted to explore whether the presence of miR-122 in HCV RNA-replicating Huh7 cells was more than pure coincidence. To this end, we inspected the 9,600 nucleotide positive-strand viral RNA genome for potential miR-122 binding sites that would fulfill the rules for a successful miRNA-target mRNA interaction. We searched for sequences in the viral mRNA that could engage in perfect Watson and Crick base pairing with nucleotides 2 through 8, the “seed sequence” of miR-122. Using this rule, we noted two predicted binding sites for miR-122 (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) in the viral noncoding regions. One was located in the variable region of the viral 3′ noncoding region of the type 1 a genotype (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>). Although this sequence was in the nominally “variable region”, inspection of all six HCV genotypes revealed that the seed match sequence itself was highly conserved (Table 1). The second miR-122 binding site was predicted to reside in the 5′ noncoding region, only 21 nucleotides from the 5′ end of the viral genome (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>). Here, the putative seed match sequence was flanked by an adenosine residue. This leads to further base pairing with nucleotide 1 in the miRNA, which is in most cases a uridine residue, resulting in increased specificity of microRNA-target interactions. The putative seed match sequence for miR-122, including the flanking adenosine residue, is highly conserved among all viral genotypes with the exception of the seed match sequence in genotype 2 which lacks the anchoring adenosine (Table 1).</p>

The predicted miR-122 binding sites in HCV are conserved in all genotypes. The sequence of the 5′UTR from nucleotides 10-30 in the genome, and of the 3′UTR from the stop codon to the end of the predicted binding site, is shown for each genotype. The seed matches are indicated in bold type.
</p>
    <p num="p-0073">To determine whether miR-122 played a functional role in regulating HCV gene expression we tested whether the accumulation of replicon RNAs would be affected when miR-122 was inactivated in NNeo/C-5B Huh7 cells (Ikeda, M. Yi, K. Li, S. M. Lemon, J. Virol. 76, 2997 (2002)). These cells constitutively express dicistronic viral replicons, in which the HCV internal ribosome entry site (IRES) directs the synthesis of the neomycin resistance gene product and the encephalomyocarditis viral IRES directs the synthesis of the structural and nonstructural proteins of the HCV-N 1b strain (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, top diagram). To inactivate miR-122 in this cell line, NNeo/C-5B cells were transfected with a 2′-O-methylated RNA oligonucleotide (122-2′OMe), 31 nucleotides in length, with exact complementarity to miR-122; 2′O-methylated complementary RNA nucleotides have been shown to sequester miRNAs (Hutvagner, et al., PLoS Biol. 2, E98 (2004); Meister, et al., RNA 10, 544 (2004)). As a control for functional inactivation of miR-122 we monitored the expression of eGFP sensor mRNAs (eGFP-122) that contained sequences complementary to miR-122 in their 3′ noncoding regions. Due to its complete complementarity, miR-122 should function as an siRNA on these target molecules and lead to their nucleolytic degradation. Indeed, little full-length eGFP-122 RNA was visible in cells transfected with plasmids encoding eGFP-122 (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, lane 3), although a similar RNA that contained sites complementary to the brain-specific miR-124 was expressed at high levels (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, lane 2). Upon transfection with 122-2′OMe, the amount of eGFP-122 RNA dramatically increased (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, lane 4), whereas a randomized version of this oligomer (Rand-2′OMe, lane 5) or an oligomer complementary to the miRNA let-7a (let7-2′OMe) had no effect (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, lane 6). A 23 mer oligomer complementary to miR-122 had the same effect as the 31 mer.</p>
    <p num="p-0074">Surprisingly, the level of HCV viral replicon RNA was specifically and dramatically reduced when miR-122 was inactivated (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, lanes 4 and 7). Reduced viral mRNA abundance resulted in a decrease in HCV protein expression in cells transfected with the 122-2′OMe oligomer, while the level of eGFP sensor protein increased under this experimental condition (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, lane 3). It was possible that the 122-2′OMe oligomers affected replicon RNA and protein levels by interacting with the negative strand of HCV, which has considerable complementarity to the oligomer sequence in the region surrounding the predicted miR-122 binding sites. However, an oligomer with exact complementarity to the negative strand in the 3′ noncoding region encompassing the predicted miR-122 binding site had no effect on replicon level, suggesting that the viral negative strand is not accessible to the oligomer. Furthermore, the 122-2′OMe oligomer did not affect total protein synthesis in transfected cells, excluding the possibility that the 122-2′OMe oligomer induced antiviral effects. Overall, these findings indicate that miR-122 is essential to maintain intracellular abundance of HCV replicon RNAs.</p>
    <p num="p-0075">To determine whether miR-122 would affect RNA accumulation in cells newly transfected with replicating HCV RNAs, RNA transcripts were synthesized from a cDNA that encodes a full-length genotype 1a strain H77c genome with five adaptive mutations (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, top diagram) that allow high levels of RNA replication in Huh7 cells (Yi &amp; Lemon, J. Virol. 78, 7904 (2004)). Introduction of these RNA molecules into Huh7 cells led to accumulation of viral RNA in the presence of endogenous miR-122 (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, lanes 1 and 2); in contrast, viral RNA failed to accumulate when miR-122 was sequestered by 122-2′OMe oligomers (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, lane 3). Thus, miR-122 is required to maintain HCV RNA abundance of both genotypes 1a and 1b, in stably expressing cell lines and upon direct transfection.</p>
    <p num="p-0076">To determine whether the putative miR-122 binding sites were required for the miR-122 effects on RNA accumulation, mutations were introduced into the full-length H77c cDNA. Transfection of H77c RNAs containing a four-nucleotide substitution mutation in the predicted seed match in the 3′ noncoding region (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>), which should abolish miR-122 binding, did not diminish RNA accumulation (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, lane 2). In contrast, a four-nucleotide substitution mutation in the predicted seed match in the 5′ noncoding region (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) failed to induce RNA accumulation (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, lane 3). Strikingly, genomes that contained a two-nucleotide (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, lane 4) or even a single-nucleotide (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, lane 5) substitution mutation at position 27 in the viral genome (m5′C) also failed to accumulate five days after transfection. These findings indicate either that failure to recruit miR-122 resulted in loss of viral RNA, or that the mutations had some effect on RNA replication or stability.</p>
    <p num="p-0077">If mutations in the miR-122 seed sequence reduced RNA accumulation due to poor binding of miR-122, ectopic expression of miR-122 RNAs that contained a mutation at the third nucleotide from the 5′ end (mC) should restore the formation of miR-122 (mC)-m5′C RNA complexes (Lewis, et al., Cell 120, 15 (2005)). Ectopic expression of wildtype miR-122 RNAs did not rescue m5′C-containing mutated viral RNAs (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, lane 3), but enhanced the abundance of wildtype viral RNAs (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, lane 1) and replicon RNAs (FIGS. S<b>3</b>A &amp; B), demonstrating that the introduced miR-122 RNAs were processed to functional single-stranded miR-122 RNA molecules and that the endogenous pool of miR-122 that mediates the accumulation of viral RNA is limiting. In contrast, expression of mutated m5′C miR-122 duplexes allowed accumulation of m5′C-containing viral RNAs (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, lane 4), strongly arguing for a genetic interaction between miR-122 and the 5′ terminal sequences of the HCV genome. Furthermore, the rescue of mutated m5′C-containing viral RNAs by mutated mC-miR-122s must be due to a direct HCV RNA-miR-122 interaction, rather than an indirect effect via another, probably cellular, miR-122 target.</p>
    <p num="p-0078">We next examined whether miR-122 modulates-translation of HCV RNA, known to occur by an unusual internal ribosome entry mechanism (Ji, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A 101, 16990 (2004), Otto, Cell 119, 369 (2004); Pestova, et al., Genes Dev. 12, 67 (1998)). Specifically, we monitored the production of HCV core protein from replicating and non-replicating viral RNAs in the presence or absence of a functional miR-122 binding site. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows that similar amounts of core protein accumulated in cells transfected with wildtype (lane 1) or m5′C-mutant RNAs (lane 2) at twenty hours after transfection, a time point at which little RNA replication should have taken place. To test directly whether core was synthesized from input RNAs, translation of replication-defective viral RNAs was examined. Results showed that wildtype (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, lane 3) and m5′C-mutant (lane 4) input RNAs were translated with similar efficiencies, indicating that miR-122 regulates HCV RNA abundance at a step subsequent to translation, most likely at the RNA replication step.</p>
    <p num="p-0079">Our finding that the HCV genome recruits miR-122 to its 5′ end is novel. Our finding demonstrates that miR122 is a target for controlling levels of HCV, and therefore a target for treating HCV mediated disease conditions.</p>

The sequences were: 122-2′OMe, 5′AGACACAAACACCAUUGUCACACUCCACAGC (SEQ ID NO:15); Rand-2′OMe, 5′CACGUUAAAACCAUACGCACUACGAAACCCC (SEQ ID NO:16); let7-2′OMe, 5′CUAAAACUAUACAACCUACUACCUCAUCCCA (SEQ ID NO:17); 122-2′OMe23, 5′ACAAACACCAUUGUCACACUCCA (SEQ ID NO:18); HCVbs-2′OMe, 5′UGAACGGGGAGCUAAACACUCCA ((SEQ ID NO:19); miR-122 wt, 5′UGGAGUGUGACAAUGGUGUUUGU ((SEQ ID NO:20); miR-122 mC, 5′UGCAGUGUGACAAUGGUGUUUGU (SEQ ID NO:21); miR-122*, 5′AAACGCCAUUAUCACACUAAAUA ((SEQ ID NO:22). Duplexes were formed between the wt or mC forms of miR-122 and miR-122*. The miR-122 sensor plasmid eGFP-122 was constructed by PCR-mediated insertion of the sequence 5′ACAAACACCAUUGUCACACUCCA (SEQ ID NO:23), which has exact complementarity to miR-122, at the Not I restriction site in the 3′noncoding region of plasmid pd2eGFP-N1 (Clontech). To construct the control vector eGFP-124, the sequence 5′TTAAGGCACGCGGTGAATGCCA (SEQ ID NO:24), which is complementary to the brain-specific miR-124, was inserted. Substitution mutations were introduced into the 3′ and 5′noncoding regions of the H77c replicon vector (Yi &amp; Lemon, J Virol 78, 7904 (August 2004)) by overlap PCR using mutagenic primers, and subsequent ligation of the PCR products into the parent vector.</p>
    <p num="h-0018">B. Cell Culture and Transfection</p>
    <p num="p-0081">The Huh7, HeLa and HepG2 cell lines were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% non-essential amino acids (Gibco). The Huh7 cell line containing the dicistronic replicon NNeo/C-5B has been described previously (Ikeda, et al., <i>J Virol </i>76, 2997 (March 2002)) and was maintained in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418. In vitro transcribed H77c genomic RNA was introduced into Huh7 cells by electroporation as described in Yi &amp; Lemon, supra, and RNA was prepared and processed 5 days later. To observe protein synthesis from replication-deficient H77c RNA, Dmrie-C (Invitrogen) was used to deliver RNA into Huh7 cells, and protein lysates were prepared and processed 20 hours later. This method was used because electroporated cells are not fully adherent at such early timepoints. DNA constructs and oligonucleotides were introduced into cells using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 2′-O-methylated oligonucleotides and the miR-122 RNA duplexes were delivered at a concentration of 50 nM into cells in 6-well plates. Transfected cells were cultured for 48 hours before harvesting.</p>
    <p num="h-0019">C. RNA Isolation and Northern Blotting</p>
    <p num="p-0082">Total RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. To detect miRNA expression, 30 μg of total RNA was separated on 15% polyacrylamide gels containing 7M urea in 0.5×TBE, transferred to Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham), and hybridized to a 5′ <sup>32</sup>P-labelled oligonucleotide complementary to miR-122 with the sequence 5′ACAAACACCAUUGUCACACUCCA (SEQ ID NO:25). To analyse mRNA levels, 2.5 μg of RNA from the NNeo/C-5B replicon cells, or 15 μg of RNA from cells transfected with H77c RNA, was separated in 1% agarose gels containing 1×MOPS buffer and 2.2M formaldehyde, and transferred to Zeta-probe membrane (Bio-Rad). The membranes were hybridized in ExpressHyb (Clontech) to random-primed <sup>32</sup>P-labelled DNA probes corresponding to nucleotides 84-374 of HCV, 40-814 of eGFP, and 685-1171 of α-actin as indicated.</p>
    <p num="h-0020">D. Western Blotting and Metabolic Labelling</p>
    <p num="p-0083">Protein samples were obtained by scraping cells into RIPA containing a complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). 10 μg of protein was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Membranes were probed with antibody 6G7 directed against the HCV core protein (a kind gift of Harry Greenberg, Stanford University), or antibodies directed against eGFP (Roche) or actin (Sigma). For metabolic labelling, cells were incubated in methionine-free medium for 1 hour before incubation with <sup>35</sup>S-methionine for 1 hour and extraction of protein. 25 μg of protein was precipitated using trichloroacetic acid and <sup>35</sup>S-methionine incorporation was quantitated by filter binding.</p>
    <p num="h-0021">E. Sequence Data</p>
    <p num="p-0084">Sequences of 5′ and 3′noncoding regions of different HCV genotypes were obtained from the HCV database, located at the web site produced by placing “http://” before and “.gov” after “hcv.lanl” and representative examples of each genotype are shown in Table 1. The strains were: H77c (genotype 1a), GenBank accession no. AF011751; HCV-N (1b), AF139594; JFH-1 (2a), AB047639; NZL1 (3a), D17763; HEMA51 (4a), D45193 and D45194; FR741 (5a), D50466 and D50467; TH271 (6f), D37848 and D37858.</p>
    <p num="p-0085">It is evident from the above results and discussion that the subject invention provides for new ways of treating viral mediated disease conditions, such as HCV mediated disease conditions. As such, the subject invention represents a significant contribution to the art.</p>
