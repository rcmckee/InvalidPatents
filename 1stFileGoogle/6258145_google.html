Each of these applications is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention relates to reverse flow air cleaner arrangements. That is, the invention concerns air cleaner arrangements wherein filtering flow is in a direction with the “clean” side of the air filter being around an exterior thereof, and the “dirty” side of the air filter being along an interior thereof. The invention particularly concerns such air cleaner arrangements having drainage systems for water accumulating in an interior of associated air filter elements. The invention also concerns provision of preferred components, such as air filter elements, for use with such arrangements; and, to methods involving the use of such arrangements.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>In general, air cleaner arrangements include a housing and an air filter element. The housing is configured such that air is directed through the air filter element, for filtering. Various geometric configurations of the air cleaner housing, the air filter element, and related seal arrangements are used to effect this.</p>
    <p>Many air cleaner arrangements include generally cylindrical air filter elements. Such elements typically include filter media arranged in a cylindrical pattern, with end caps. Seal arrangements are used either on or in conjunction with the end caps, to provide appropriate sealing with the housing or other portions of the air cleaner, and to control the direction of air flow.</p>
    <p>Reverse air flow air cleaner arrangements are generally those in which air is directed to an interior of the air filter element before it is filtered, and the air is filtered as it passes through the air filter element from the interior to the exterior. If the air filter element is cylindrical, this means that the unfiltered air is directed into the interior of the cylinder, and then through the filter media, to an exterior, during filtering. Material entrained in the air directed into the air filter, then, is left along an interior of the cylindrical filter media.</p>
    <p>Consider, for example, a reverse flow air cleaner arrangement, having a cylindrical air filter element, utilized on an over the highway truck. Air directed into the interior of the cylindrical element may include dust, leaves, large particulates, and even moisture entrained therein. This material will tend to build up in the interior of the air filter element, in time. If the water depth inside the air filter becomes significant, the water, alone or with fine particulates or salt in suspension, can permeate the filter media. This has the potential to damage engine components. It would be preferred that arrangements be provided to drain the water from the interior of the filter element.</p>
    <p>In those arrangements wherein the filter element is operationally oriented such that the longitudinal axis of the cylindrical air filter is substantially vertical, drainage arrangements involving drainage apertures in one <b>15</b> of the end caps have been used. In general, these have involved offset (from a central location) apertures in one end cap, and unless the air filter element is oriented nearly perfectly vertically, drainage is inefficient. Also, in such arrangements debris can sometimes collect along interior surfaces of the housing when the arrangement is opened and the element is removed; and, unless the housing is thoroughly cleaned before the element is reinserted into the housing, the debris can interfere with attainment of a good seal at critical locations.</p>
    <heading>Summary of the Disclosure of U.S. Ser. No. 08/742,244</heading> <p>According to the disclosure of U.S. Ser. No. 08/742,244, an air filter arrangement is provided. The air filter arrangement includes a housing and an air filter element having first and second opposite end caps, filter media and an open filter interior. The first end cap has an air inlet opening therein, for air to be passed into the arrangement to be filtered. The second end cap has a central drainage aperture and an interior surface constructed and arranged to funnel moisture that collects on the second end cap interior surface to the central drainage aperture, and outwardly from the filter element. The central drainage aperture is preferably positioned at a center of the second end cap, with a longitudinal axis of the air filter element passing therethrough. The air filter arrangement also includes an air flow direction arrangement constructed and arranged to direct air flow into the housing, into the open filter interior, through the filter media for filtering and then outwardly from the housing, as filtered air. The air flow direction arrangement generally comprises various features of the housing, seals and filter element.</p>
    <p>Preferably, the interior surface of the second end cap is circular. In certain embodiments it includes a plurality of radially directed troughs which terminate in the central drainage aperture. The troughs can be used to help funnel and direct moisture collected on an interior surface of the air filter element in use (i.e., “when operationally” or “operatively” assembled).</p>
    <p>In certain preferred arrangements, according to the U.S. Ser. No. 08/742,244 disclosure, the second end cap includes an outer annular compressible portion and the housing includes an annular sealing surface against which the second end cap outer annular compressible portion is sealed, when the air filter arrangement is operatively assembled for use. Such a seal is referred to herein as a peripheral or annular radial seal, around the second end cap. That is, in this context the term “annular” refers to a sealing portion around the outside of the end cap, which seals under radial compression.</p>
    <p>In a preferred embodiment, according to the U.S. Ser. No. 08/742,244 disclosure, the housing includes a base having a central, preferably recessed, pan and a sealing bead circumferentially positioned around the central recessed pan. A drainage aperture is provided in the central pan, so that water collected in the pan can be removed from the housing. With such an arrangement, preferably the second end cap is constructed and arranged to form a secondary seal with the sealing bead in the base, when the air filter element is operatively positioned within the housing. Preferably the manner of engagement with the seal bead is by provision of a mating “trough” in the second end cap outer surface.</p>
    <p>According to the U.S. Ser. No. 08/742,244 disclosure, preferably the second end cap outer surface has an outer edge or lip; and, the second end cap outer surface is recessed (or depressed) in extension between the outer edge and the trough which engages the sealing bead and the base. In this manner, a preferred gap or space is provided between the filter element second end cap, and the housing base, in the region between the sealing bead of the base and an outer peripheral area of the base. A space in this location accommodates debris that may collect in the housing, without interference with the seal between the second end cap and the housing. This is facilitated by those arrangements involving provision of the seal along an annular portion of the end cap, as a radial seal, rather than as an end or axial seal.</p>
    <p>According to the U.S. Ser. No. 08/742,244 disclosure, preferably the second end cap outer surface is configured to provide a funnel surface having a declination angle of at least about 1°, and preferably 1° to 3°, in the region of extension between the outer edge of the second end cap and the portion of the end cap which engages the seal bead in the base.</p>
    <p>In preferred arrangements, according to the U.S. Ser. No. 08/742,244 disclosure, an evacuation valve is mounted in the drainage aperture of the recessed pan in the base. This provides for a preferred, controlled, drainage of moisture from the system.</p>
    <p>In preferred embodiments, according to the U.S. Ser. No. 08/742,244 disclosure, a soft polymeric material is utilized for the first and second end caps. Preferably each of the polymeric end caps comprise polyurethane. For the end caps, a polyurethane foam material having an “as molded” density of about 14-22 lbs per ft<sup>3 </sup>will be preferred (most preferably about 18.4). In some embodiments, the same material can be utilized for both end caps.</p>
    <p>In preferred constructions, according to the U.S. Ser. No. 08/742,244 disclosure, an air inlet tube is provided in the housing, which is configured to generate a radial seal with the first end cap of the filter element.</p>
    <p>In an alternate embodiment, described in the U.S. Ser. No. 08/742,244 disclosure, an arrangement having a sheet metal end cap as the second end cap is provided. This arrangement is preferably axially sealed, by provision of a primary seal gasket axially compressed between the second end cap and the base, when the air filter arrangement is operationally assembled. A secondary gasket can also be provided in such arrangements between a selected portion of the second end cap and the housing base.</p>
    <p>According to the U.S. Ser. No. 8/742,244 disclosure, a preferred filter element is provided. The preferred filter element comprises a generally cylindrical extension of filter media. The filter media may be, for example, a pleated paper filter media. Preferably, an inner support liner and an outer support liner are provided, for the cylindrical extension of filter media.</p>
    <p>Preferably the arrangement has first and second end caps, the first end cap including an air inlet opening therein. The second end cap preferably has a central drainage aperture and an interior surface constructed and arranged to funnel moisture, collected on the interior surface of the second end cap, to the central drainage aperture. The central drainage aperture is preferably located at an approximate center of the end cap, on a longitudinal axis of the cylindrical extension of filter media. A preferred configuration for the interior surface of the second end cap, is as an interior of a funnel. In some embodiments, the second end cap interior surface includes a plurality of radially directed troughs therein, which terminate at the central drainage aperture.</p>
    <p>Other preferred features for the preferred air filter element described in the U.S. Ser. No. 08/742,244 disclosure include: a circular sealing trough on an outer surface of the second end cap; and, a recess between an outer edge of the end cap outer surface and the circular trough. Also, a compressible region providing for a radial seal along an annular portion of the second end cap is preferred.</p>
    <p>According to the U.S. Ser. No. 08/742,244 disclosure, a method of operating a reverse flow air filter arrangement is provided. In general, the method comprises collecting moisture within the filter element and draining the moisture from the filter element through a central aperture in the end cap, by funneling the moisture to the central aperture.</p>
    <heading>Summary of the Present Disclosure</heading> <p>According to the portion of the present specification which comprises added disclosure relating to FIGS. 9-14, the end cap which includes the drainage aperture therein, is provided in a preferred composite structure. The composite results from an outer portion comprising a soft, compressible, polymeric material; and, an inner “pre-form” or insert, which becomes positioned between the polymeric material and the inner liner, during molding. The insert has preferred inner surface characteristics, to accomplish desirable flow of liquid to the drainage aperture, and outwardly from an interior of the filter element. In addition, it has preferred features to facilitate molding using a free rise technique.</p>
    <p>The preferred “pre-form” or insert also has depending legs with outwardly projecting feet. The legs and feet operate, cooperatively, as a mold stand-off for media. An underside of each foot has a bead thereon, to facilitate this.</p>
    <p>Further features and advantages from the preferred inserts and “pre-forms” described herein, as well as techniques for use, will be apparent from the more detailed description below.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading> <heading>Disclosure of U.S. Ser. No. 08/742,244 and its Parent U.S. Ser. No. 08/344,371</heading> <p>The reference numeral <b>1</b>, FIG. 1, generally designates an air cleaner assembly according to the disclosure of Ser. No. 08/742,244. FIG. 1 is a side elevational view of air cleaner assembly <b>1</b>. In the Figure, housing <b>2</b> is depicted generally. The housing <b>2</b> includes an inlet construction <b>3</b> and a filter element receiver or can <b>4</b>. Can <b>4</b> includes outlet <b>7</b>. In use, air to be filtered passes through inlet construction <b>3</b>, and is directed to an interior of can <b>4</b>. Within can <b>4</b>, the air is directed through a filter element, not viewable in FIG. <b>1</b>. After being filtered by the filter element, the air passes outwardly through outlet <b>7</b> and is directed to the air intake of the engine, not shown. Herein, the term “air flow direction arrangement” is used to generally refer to those features of an air filter arrangement which direct air flow in the preferred manner or along a preferred path. The term may refer to a variety of features, and typically refers to internal configurations of the housing and filter element, as well as the various seals.</p>
    <p>Still referring to FIG. 1, inlet construction <b>3</b> is mounted on can <b>4</b>, and is secured thereto by bolts <b>8</b> and nuts <b>9</b>. Access to the interior of can <b>4</b>, and a filter element positioned therein, is obtained by loosening bolts <b>8</b> and separating inlet construction <b>3</b> from can <b>4</b>.</p>
    <p>For the particular construction shown, inlet construction <b>3</b> includes an upper dome <b>12</b>, perforated air inlet screen <b>13</b> and an inlet tube <b>14</b> (the inlet tube not being viewable in FIG. 1, but being shown in FIG. 4 in cross-section).</p>
    <p>Still referring to FIG. 1, can <b>4</b> includes a drainage aperture therein, the drainage aperture not being viewable in FIG. 1, but being shown at reference numeral <b>18</b> in FIG. <b>5</b>. The drainage aperture is covered by an evacuation valve <b>19</b>. The evacuation valve <b>19</b> may be, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,429,108, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. In general, the drainage aperture <b>18</b> is positioned in a portion of can <b>4</b> which will be, when assembly <b>1</b> is operatively installed, positioned at the bottom of the assembly <b>1</b>. Thus, water will tend to collect near aperture <b>18</b>, and be drained therefrom, in use. This will be more readily apparent from further descriptions wherein internal details of air cleaner assembly <b>1</b> are presented.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 2, air cleaner assembly <b>1</b> includes four bolts and nuts <b>9</b> for securing the inlet construction <b>3</b> to the filter can <b>4</b>. While the number of bolts used may be varied, depending on the particular application, it is an advantage of constructions according to the U.S. Ser. No. 08/742,244 disclosure that filter assemblies as large as about 15 inches in outside diameter can be reliably secured closed, with as few as about three to five bolts. Features which facilitate this, will be apparent from further descriptions.</p>
    <p>An exploded view of air cleaner assembly <b>1</b> is depicted in FIG. <b>3</b>. In FIG. 3, air cleaner assembly <b>1</b> is shown with inlet construction <b>3</b> separated from filter can <b>4</b>, and with air cleaner element <b>21</b> removed from can <b>4</b>. For the particular arrangement shown, air cleaner element <b>21</b> is generally cylindrical. Element <b>21</b> includes first and second end caps <b>23</b> and <b>24</b>; filter media <b>25</b>; inner support <b>26</b> (FIG. <b>4</b>); and, outer support <b>27</b>. For the particular embodiment shown, filter media <b>25</b> comprises a pleated paper construction <b>30</b>. In general, pleated paper construction <b>30</b> comprises a cylinder <b>31</b> of fluted paper with the flutes running in a direction longitudinally along, and generally parallel to, a central axis <b>33</b> of the element <b>21</b>. It will be understood that alternate filter media constructions could be utilized. In general, the filter media <b>25</b> extends between the end caps <b>23</b> and <b>24</b>. For assembly <b>1</b> depicted, end caps <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> comprise polymeric material as described below, in which opposite ends of the filter media <b>25</b> are set or potted.</p>
    <p>In FIG. 4 a fragmentary cross-sectional view of air cleaner assembly <b>1</b> is depicted. In FIG. 4, the inlet construction <b>3</b> and portions of air cleaner assembly <b>1</b>, in association therewith, are depicted.</p>
    <p>In general, the filter media <b>25</b> is positioned between inner support <b>26</b> and outer support <b>27</b>. Each support generally comprises a tubular or cylindrical extension of perforated metal or expanded metal, opposite ends of which are also set in, or potted in, end caps <b>23</b> and <b>24</b>.</p>
    <p>In general, end cap <b>23</b> is open and end cap <b>24</b> is closed. That is, end cap <b>23</b> includes a large inlet aperture <b>28</b> (FIG. 4) therein, for introduction of air to be filtered into filter element interior <b>35</b>. End cap <b>24</b>, on the other hand, is generally closed, but for a drainage aperture extending therethrough as described below.</p>
    <p>Still referring to FIG. 4, it can be seen that inlet construction <b>3</b> includes inlet tube <b>14</b>. When assembled, inlet tube <b>14</b> extends into aperture <b>28</b> in end cap <b>23</b>. At least in this location, end cap <b>23</b> is preferably formed of a soft compressible material. When inlet tube <b>14</b> is not inserted into aperture <b>28</b>, at least a portion of aperture <b>28</b> in its uncompressed state will generally have an inside diameter slightly larger than an outside diameter of section <b>39</b> of inlet tube <b>14</b>; i.e., the portion of tube <b>14</b> which engages end cap <b>23</b> when arrangement <b>1</b> is operatively assembled. Thus, when inlet tube <b>14</b> is inserted through aperture <b>28</b>, end cap material in region <b>40</b> will be compressed. In this manner a seal is formed at region <b>41</b>. Such seals are described, for example, in conjunction with air cleaner assemblies in U.S. Pat. No. B2 4,720,292, the disclosure of which are incorporated herein by reference. It is noted that the arrangement of U.S. Pat. No. 4,720,282 is not necessarily a reverse flow arrangement: however, the principles relating to the formation of the seal are basically the same. Such seals are sometimes referred to as “radial” or “radial-type” seals, since the forces maintaining sealing are directed radially around a central longitudinal axis <b>33</b> (FIG. 3) of the tube and element, rather than co-extensively or coaxially therewith. For the particular arrangement shown in FIGS. 1-7, material at region <b>40</b> is compressed between and against both inlet tube <b>14</b> and inner support <b>26</b>; that is, inner support <b>26</b> is set sufficiently deeply into end cap <b>23</b> that a portion of it is positioned behind compressible region <b>40</b>, to provide support. Thus, a good seal is effected. The shape of aperture <b>28</b> in region <b>41</b> will preferably be as a ribbed or stepped funnel (or tapered), to facilitate engagement. Such a ribbed arrangement is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,238,474, incorporated herein by reference. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,720,292 a similarly tapered surface without ribs is shown. Preferably, three equally sized steps from a region of diameter about the same as the inlet tube O.D. are used, with the amount of total compression of the smallest diameter rib (i.e., region of most compression) being about 21.4% (20%±3%). The size of each step will depend in part on the diameter of the inlet tube. In general, for an element used with an inlet tube having an O.D. of 175-200 mm, a total compression thereacross of 2.7 mm (or 1.35 mm for any location since any location compresses about one-half of the total compression) for the smallest rib would be used.</p>
    <p>It will be understood, then, that for the arrangement shown in FIGS. 1-7, seal <b>41</b> prevents air directed into filter interior <b>35</b> through inlet tube <b>14</b> from bypassing filter media <b>25</b> and getting into clean air plenum <b>44</b>. In general, the various portions of the arrangement <b>4</b> cooperate as an air flow direction arrangement to direct air flow: into the housing, into the filter interior, through the filter media and outwardly from the housing.</p>
    <p>Another point of potential leakage of unfiltered air into clean air plenum <b>44</b> is presented by the location whereat inlet construction <b>3</b> engages filter can <b>4</b>. This region is located generally at <b>50</b>; i.e., where bolts <b>8</b> secure inlet construction <b>3</b> to filter can <b>4</b>. At region <b>50</b>, inlet construction <b>3</b> is provided with an outwardly extending flange <b>52</b>; and, can <b>4</b> is provided with an outwardly extending flange <b>53</b>. Seal ring <b>54</b> is provided in extension around can <b>4</b>, between flanges <b>52</b> and <b>53</b>. Seal ring <b>54</b> is positioned at a location between bolts <b>8</b> and filter element <b>21</b>. When bolts <b>8</b> are tightened, seal ring <b>54</b> will be compressed between flanges <b>52</b> and <b>53</b>, i.e., at a location between inlet construction <b>3</b> and filter can <b>4</b>, providing a seal. Thus, air leakage into plenum <b>44</b>, by passage between portions of can <b>4</b> and inlet construction <b>3</b> is inhibited. Filter ring <b>54</b> may be a conventional O-ring type gasket.</p>
    <p>Attention is now directed to FIG. 5, which is a cross-sectional view showing the “bottom half” or “opposite end” of assembly <b>1</b> from the end whereat inlet construction <b>3</b> is located. Referring to FIG. 5, reference numeral <b>60</b> generally designates an end of can wall <b>61</b>. Within end <b>60</b> is positioned a cover or base <b>63</b> of can <b>4</b>. Base <b>63</b> is configured in a preferred manner, to advantage.</p>
    <p>For the particular embodiment shown, base <b>63</b> is circular, to conform to the cross-sectional configuration of can wall <b>61</b> at end <b>60</b>. For the particular embodiment shown, base <b>63</b> is also radially symmetric. That is, the features of base <b>63</b> are configured radially symmetrically about central axis <b>33</b>. Base <b>63</b> includes end flange <b>65</b> for engagement with end <b>60</b>, for example by means of welds.</p>
    <p>Progressing inwardly from flange <b>65</b> toward its center <b>66</b>, the features of the preferred base <b>63</b> depicted are as follows: an annular circumferential sealing surface <b>67</b> is provided; a bend or corner <b>68</b>; an end surface <b>69</b>; a secondary seal bead or ridge <b>70</b>; and, a central pan <b>71</b>. In the center <b>66</b> of pan <b>71</b>, drainage aperture <b>18</b> is provided.</p>
    <p>The arrangement shown in FIGS. 1-7 is configured preferentially so that when oriented for use, pan <b>71</b> is at a lowermost or recessed location, so that water will drain to pan <b>71</b> under gravity influence. As the water drains into pan <b>71</b>, it will be drained outwardly from air cleaner assembly <b>1</b> through drainage aperture <b>18</b>. Particular features described herein are provided, for a preferred manner of debris collection within assembly <b>1</b> and drainage of collected moisture to aperture <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p>Still referring to FIG. 5, filter element <b>21</b> includes end cap <b>24</b> thereon. End cap <b>24</b> is of an appropriate material, and of appropriate size, so that when it is pushed into and against base <b>63</b>, an outer circumferential surface <b>75</b> of the end cap <b>24</b> engages surface <b>67</b> of base <b>63</b> in a sealing manner. That is, an annular seal <b>76</b> is formed in region <b>77</b>, circumferentially around end cap <b>24</b>. This is facilitated by preferably providing surface <b>67</b> in a cylindrical configuration extending generally parallel to axis <b>33</b>. The seal prevents unfiltered air from reaching clean air plenum <b>44</b>. As a result of the circumferential seal, sealing against flow of air is not required between any other portions of filter element <b>21</b> and base <b>63</b>. A secondary seal <b>80</b>, described herein below, is provided, however, between end cap <b>24</b> and base <b>63</b>. The secondary seal <b>80</b> is generally provided to inhibit movement of debris or water into region <b>81</b>, between element <b>21</b> and base <b>63</b>, rather than to necessarily prevent flow of air therebetween. Thus, while seal <b>76</b> should be in a form sufficient to withstand a pressure differential thereacross of up to about 40 inches of H<sub>2</sub>O, secondary seal <b>80</b> will generally be sufficient if it can maintain at pressure differential thereacross of up to about 2 inches (and typically only up to about <b>2</b>-<b>4</b> inches) of H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
    <p>Still referring to FIG. 5, end cap <b>24</b> includes a circular recess or trough <b>85</b> therein. Trough <b>85</b> is sized and configured to receive and sealingly engage bead <b>70</b>. Trough <b>85</b> should be sized, relative to bead <b>70</b>, such that when element <b>21</b> is pressed against base <b>63</b>, bead <b>70</b> is pushed into trough <b>85</b> to form a seal therewith, capable of holding a pressure differential of up to about <b>2</b>-<b>4</b> inches of H<sub>2</sub>O. This could be readily accomplished by forming the related region <b>86</b> of end cap <b>24</b> of an appropriately soft compressible polymeric material into which rigid bead <b>70</b> can be pressed, for engagement.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIGS. 5 and 6, it is noted that for the preferred embodiment depicted surface <b>90</b> of end cap <b>24</b> is recessed from outer edge <b>91</b> to region <b>92</b>, so that a space between surface <b>90</b> and end surface <b>69</b> is provided, when filter element <b>21</b> is operatively positioned within can <b>4</b>. The amount of recess can be varied, depending upon the size of the arrangement. In general, an angle of inclination from edge <b>91</b> to region <b>92</b> on the order of about 1° to 3° will be sufficient.</p>
    <p>Advantages which result from this inclination, will be apparent from further descriptions herein below. In general, the space between surface <b>90</b> and end surface <b>69</b> ensures that there will not be interference with easy formation of the annular, radial, seal.</p>
    <p>Still referring to FIGS. 5 and 6, internal surface <b>94</b> of end cap <b>24</b> is configured to slope downwardly, when the assembly <b>1</b> is oriented as shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, in extension from outer region <b>95</b> toward central aperture <b>96</b>. Preferably, internal surface <b>95</b> is conical or funnel shaped in this region. Thus, any water which collects on internal surface <b>94</b> will tend to flow toward central aperture <b>96</b> and therethrough, into recessed pan <b>71</b>. In some embodiments, recessed radial troughs extending outwardly and upwardly from central aperture <b>96</b> can be used to facilitate this flow. Such an arrangement is shown, for example, in FIG. 7 (a top plan view of element <b>21</b>) wherein four evenly (radially) spaced, recessed, troughs <b>99</b> are depicted. It will be understood that each of troughs <b>99</b> generally inclines downwardly as it extends from region <b>95</b> toward central aperture <b>96</b>, to facilitate collection of water within interior <b>35</b> and direction of the collected water to central aperture <b>96</b>. An advantage to troughs <b>99</b> is that should a leaf or other large particulate material become positioned over central aperture <b>96</b>, water can still flow into and through the aperture <b>96</b> by means of the troughs <b>99</b>, since the troughs <b>99</b> can generally direct water flow underneath debris collected on top of internal surface <b>94</b>.</p>
    <p>Numerous advantages result from the preferred features described. As assembly <b>1</b> is used for a filtering operation, air will generally flow through inlet tube <b>14</b> into interior <b>35</b>, carrying within it moisture and/or debris. The moisture and debris will tend to collect within interior <b>35</b>, on internal surface <b>94</b> of end cap <b>24</b>, since arrangement <b>1</b> will generally be configured with end cap <b>24</b> positioned beneath inlet tube <b>14</b>. Water collecting on internal surface <b>95</b> will generally be directed toward central aperture <b>96</b>, for drainage into recessed pan <b>71</b> and eventually drainage outwardly from assembly <b>1</b> through drainage aperture <b>18</b>. Evacuation valve <b>19</b>, if used, will facilitate this.</p>
    <p>Because sealing between end cap <b>24</b> and housing <b>2</b> is positioned along annular circular sealing surface <b>67</b>, i.e., at region <b>77</b>, the critical sealing is not located at a surface where debris is likely to be spread or collect, as element <b>21</b> is removed from and replaced into housing <b>2</b>, during typical maintenance operations.</p>
    <p>Because surface <b>90</b> is recessed from end surface <b>69</b>, in extension between edge <b>91</b> and region <b>92</b>, any debris which may spread along end surface <b>69</b> during operations involving removal and insertion of filter elements into housing <b>2</b>, will not likely interfere with sufficient insertion of the element <b>21</b> into can <b>4</b> for the development of a good seal at region <b>77</b>. That is, some debris buildup along the bottom of base <b>63</b> is well tolerated.</p>
    <p>Also, secondary seal <b>80</b> will inhibit the likelihood of debris or moisture moving from pan <b>71</b> into surface <b>69</b>, or region <b>77</b>. This will also help facilitate removal of moisture from assembly <b>1</b>, since the moisture will tend to concentrate near drainage aperture <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p>In FIG. 6, the arrangement of FIG. 5 is shown exploded. From this, a preferred configuration for surface <b>75</b>, relative to circular (annular) sealing surface <b>67</b> will be understood. In particular, surface <b>75</b> includes steps <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> and <b>103</b>, with extensions <b>105</b> and <b>106</b> therebetween. Step <b>103</b> is approximately the same diameter as circular sealing surface <b>67</b>, and facilitates guidance of air cleaner element <b>21</b> into engagement with base <b>63</b>, during assembly. Step <b>102</b> is preferably slightly larger in diameter than circular sealing surface <b>67</b>, and step <b>101</b> is preferably slightly larger in diameter than step <b>102</b>, to enhance compression of end cap material in region <b>77</b>, as element <b>21</b> is inserted into base <b>63</b>, during assembly. In this manner, a good seal is formed. In general, for preferred embodiments the actual amount of compression of the end cap in region or step <b>102</b> is 3 mm±1 mm on diameter (or 1.5 mm at any location). The diameter of step <b>102</b> is preferably about 1.5 mm greater than step <b>101</b>, and about 3 mm greater than step <b>103</b>. The amount of compression in step <b>102</b> would preferably be about 21.4% (20%±3%).</p>
    <p>As indicated, the arrangement described with respect to FIGS. 1-7 generally utilizes a radial seal engagement in region <b>77</b>. Alternate sealing arrangements may be utilized. An example of such an arrangement is illustrated in the alternate embodiment of FIG. <b>8</b>.</p>
    <p>In FIG. 8 an alternate application of principles according to the Ser. No. 08/742,244 disclosure is provided. FIG. 8 illustrates an engagement between an air cleaner assembly base and a filter element, to provide advantages according to the present invention, in an arrangement which utilizes an “axial seal” between the filter element and the housing, at least at this location.</p>
    <p>In general, an axial seal is a seal which is maintained by forces directed along an axis of the filter element, as opposed to radial seal arrangements described with respect to FIGS. 1-7 which use forces directed radially around an axis. Axial seal arrangements have been widely utilized in filter elements in a variety of manners. Often a central yoke or axle is provided, along which forces are directed between the housing in the element. In other systems a bolt engagement between portions of the housing are used to compress the element against one end or both ends of the housing. The O-ring <b>54</b> in the embodiment of FIGS. 1-7, for example, provides sealing by axial compression.</p>
    <p>FIG. 8 is a fragmentary cross-sectional view of an alternate air cleaner assembly <b>115</b>. The air cleaner assembly <b>115</b> is also a reverse flow arrangement. Assembly <b>115</b> includes housing <b>116</b> and air filter element <b>117</b>. An inlet arrangement, not depicted, would be utilized to direct air flow into interior <b>118</b>. Air flow would then be through filter element <b>117</b> into clean air plenum <b>120</b>, and outwardly through a conventional outlet, not shown, into an air intake for an engine.</p>
    <p>In FIG. 8 the outer wall of the housing <b>116</b> or can, is generally shown at <b>121</b>. The housing end or base <b>123</b> is configured to perform functions generally analogous to those for base <b>63</b>, FIGS. 1-7.</p>
    <p>Still referring to FIG. 8, filter element <b>117</b> has a sheet metal end cap, such as end cap <b>125</b>. The filter element <b>117</b> includes filter media <b>126</b> potted within the end cap <b>125</b> (the opposite end cap not being shown in FIG. <b>8</b>). Element <b>117</b> includes inner and outer liners <b>127</b> and <b>128</b> respectively.</p>
    <p>Sealing between element <b>117</b> and base <b>123</b>, against air flow therebetween, is provided by gasket <b>130</b>. That is, an appropriate mechanism to apply axial forces in the direction of arrow <b>131</b> against element <b>117</b> should be provided, to compress gasket <b>130</b> between end cap <b>125</b> and base <b>123</b> and form a seal. This can be accomplished with bolts used to drive an end cover or inlet construction against an opposite end of element <b>117</b>. Preferably appropriate sizes and configurations of the element <b>117</b>, base <b>123</b> and gasket <b>130</b> are selected, so that the seal of gasket <b>130</b> will be sufficient to hold a pressure differential at least about 40 inches of H<sub>2</sub>O thereacross. In this manner, unfiltered air in region <b>132</b> is prevented from reaching clean air plenum <b>120</b>, in use.</p>
    <p>In general, the features of the preferred base <b>123</b> depicted are as follows. Base <b>123</b> is radially symmetric and includes outer flange <b>135</b>, for securement to can wall <b>121</b>, such as by welding. Base or recess area <b>136</b> is provided for a receipt of gasket <b>130</b> therein, during sealing. This is accommodated by recessed area <b>136</b> forming a trough <b>137</b>. Region <b>138</b>, of base <b>123</b>, is raised above trough <b>137</b>, and provides a raised surface <b>139</b> for provision of a secondary seal, as described below. Base <b>123</b> then defines pan <b>145</b>, by downwardly extending or declining wall <b>146</b>, towards a recessed central aperture <b>147</b>.</p>
    <p>With respect to the filter element, end cap <b>125</b> includes a downwardly slanted surface <b>149</b> toward central pan <b>150</b> having drainage aperture <b>151</b> therein.</p>
    <p>A secondary seal between end cap <b>125</b> and surface <b>139</b> is provided by secondary seal gasket <b>155</b>. This gasket <b>155</b> is intended to inhibit the migration of moisture and debris from recessed pan <b>145</b> into region <b>137</b>, whereat it could interfere with seal gasket <b>130</b>. Secondary gasket <b>155</b> need only provide a seal sufficient to inhibit substantial migration of moisture and debris, and does not need to be a primary air seal. Thus, gasket <b>155</b> need only be compressed sufficiently to withstand a pressure differential of up to about 2-4 inches of H<sub>2</sub>O thereacross.</p>
    <p>Operation of assembly <b>115</b> will now be apparent. When assembled, sufficient axial pressure is applied along the direction of arrow <b>131</b>, to provide an air seal end at gasket <b>130</b> and a secondary seal at gasket <b>155</b>. Debris and moisture directed into interior <b>118</b> will generally collect in pan <b>150</b>. In general, moisture collecting along recessed surfaces <b>149</b> will be directed downwardly toward and through aperture <b>151</b>, into pan <b>145</b> of base <b>123</b>, and eventually through drainage aperture <b>147</b> and outwardly from assembly <b>115</b>. It will be understood that a trough system (analogous to that described for FIGS. 1-7) may be utilized in pan <b>150</b>, if desired, to inhibit the likelihood of drainage aperture <b>151</b> becoming closed or plugged by debris.</p>
    <heading>Materials Described in Ser. No. 08/742,244</heading> <p>According to U.S. Ser. No. 08/742,244, while a wide variety of materials may be utilized in the constructions, the principles described were particularly developed for use, to advantage, with systems constructed from certain preferred materials. In general, the constructions were designed for utilization with sheet metal housing systems, or stainless steel housing systems; i.e., arrangements wherein the housing, in particular the inlet assembly, the can and the base, are formed from sheet metal or stainless steel parts which are secured to one another as by welding. Materials useful for such fabrication include 0.075-0.025 (incorrectly stated as 0.75-0.25 in the earlier disclosures) inches thick stainless steel or sheet metal, although other thickness are useable.

    <p>For the arrangement of FIGS. 1-7, the preferred end cap material described in U.S. Ser. No. 08/742,244 for forming the regions in the end cap that need to be compressed to form a seal is a soft polymeric material such as foamed polyurethane. Such materials include the following polyurethane, processed to an end product having an as molded density of 14-22 pounds per cubic foot (lbs/ft<sup>3</sup>).</p>
    <p>The preferred polyurethane described in Ser. No. 08/742,244 comprises a material made with I35453R resin and I3050U isocyanate.

    <p>The materials I35453R and I3050U are available from BASF Corporation, Wyandotte, Mich. 48192.</p>
    <p>For the arrangement shown in FIG. 8, the filter element includes sheet metal end caps with a fluted filter paper media element potted therein. Conventional arrangements such as potted in plastisol may be used.</p>
    <heading>Dimensions of a Typical Embodiment Described in U.S. Ser. No. 08/742,244</heading> <p>Consider an air cleaner arrangement such as depicted in FIG. 1 used on a over the highway truck (heavy duty truck). The housing would be about 13-15 inches in diameter and about 32 inches long. The element would be about 11-13 inches in diameter and about 23-26 inches long. The I.D. of the smallest rib on the sealing portion of the end cap with the inlet tube (prior to compression) would be about 6.78-7.44 inches. The I.D. of the annular surface in the housing base whereat the radial seal with second end cap occurs would be about 11.28-12.94 (incorrectly stated as 19.94 in U.S. Ser. No. 08/742,244) inches. The O.D. of the largest step on the second end cap, for sealing with the base, would be about 11.4-13.06 inches. The bead on the base for engagement with the second end cap would be large enough to extend into the trough on the end cap about 0.35 inches. The declination angle in the second end cap from its outer rim to the recess engaging the bead would be about 1.75°. The declination angle on the inside of the second end cap would be about 4°±2°.</p>
    <heading>Description Added to Disclosure of U.S. Ser. No. 08/742,244</heading> <p>It is first noted that there has been developed a preference for application of the techniques described in U.S. Ser. No. 08/742,244 since the time of filing of that application. In particular, it is desirable, when molding end cap <b>24</b>, to provide for a media stand-off to ensure that the media <b>25</b> is supported above a remaining portion of a bottom surface of the mold, when the molding occurs. The mold can be provided with a circular, raised, media stand-off positioned in a portion of the mold underneath the media <b>25</b>, during molding, to provide for this. The end cap <b>24</b> would, in general, show an indent ring corresponding to the mold stand-off, at a location aligned with media <b>25</b>, as a result of this.</p>
    <p>Also, hereinbelow a preferred material for use with the embodiment of FIGS. 9-15, as the urethane material, is provided. Such a preferred material and processes for its use, may also be used with the embodiment of FIGS. 1-7, for both end caps.</p>
    <p>It is also noted that the specific overall depiction of FIGS. 9, <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> included herein, were not part of the disclosure of U.S. Ser. No. 08/742,244. Description related to them, has been added.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 9-15 concern a variation in which the “closed” end cap having the drainage aperture therein, while it comprises polymeric material into which the ends of the inner and outer supports or liners and media are potted, further comprises a composite of polymeric material and a pre-formed insert. (By “pre-formed” in this context, reference is made to the fact that the insert was formed before a remainder of the end cap was molded.) As a result of a preferred embodiment for achieving this, shown in FIGS. 9-15, the inner surface of this end cap (which comprises the drainage surface to the aperture), is physically an inner surface of the end cap insert. This too will be understood by reference to FIGS. 9-15 and the descriptions hereinbelow.</p>
    <p>A principal difference for the embodiment of FIGS. 9-14, from the embodiment of FIGS. 1-7, concerns the referenced insert and the specifically recited composite nature of the closed end cap having the drainage aperture therein. There are, however, some further modifications in an exterior surface of the insert. These too will be described in connection with FIGS. 9-15.</p>
    <p>Attention is first directed to FIG. <b>9</b>. FIG. 9 is a fragmentary cross-sectional view of an assembly according to this alternate embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 9, assembly <b>201</b> comprises a combination of can <b>204</b> and element <b>221</b>. In FIG. 9, reference numeral <b>260</b> generally designates an end of can wall <b>261</b>. Within end <b>260</b> is positioned a cover or base <b>263</b> of can <b>204</b>. Can <b>204</b>, including base <b>263</b>, is configured analogously to can <b>4</b> and base <b>63</b> of FIG. 5, and thus includes, analogously: a configuration which is preferably radially symmetric around a central axis <b>233</b>; end flange <b>265</b>; center <b>266</b>; sealing surface <b>267</b>; bend or corner <b>268</b>; end surface <b>269</b>; secondary seal bead or ridge <b>270</b>; end recess <b>271</b>; and, in center <b>266</b>, a drainage aperture <b>218</b>. Positioned within aperture <b>218</b>, is evacuation valve <b>219</b>.</p>
    <p>Still referring to FIG. 9, filter element <b>221</b> includes end cap <b>224</b> thereon. End cap <b>224</b> comprises an appropriate material, and is of appropriate size, so that when it is pushed into and against base <b>263</b>, an outer circumferential surface <b>275</b> of the end cap <b>224</b> engages surface <b>267</b> of base <b>263</b> in a sealing manner. That is, an annular seal <b>276</b> is formed in region <b>277</b>, circumferentially around end cap <b>224</b>. As with the embodiment of FIG. 5, this is facilitated by preferably providing surface <b>267</b> in a cylindrical configuration extending generally parallel to axis <b>233</b>. As a result of the circumferential seal <b>276</b>, sealing against flow of air is not required between any other portions of filter element <b>221</b> and base <b>263</b>. A secondary seal <b>280</b>, analogous to seal <b>80</b>, FIG. 5, is provided, however, between end cap <b>224</b> and base <b>263</b>. The secondary seal <b>280</b> inhibits movement of debris or water into region <b>281</b>, between element <b>221</b> and base <b>263</b>.</p>
    <p>It is noted that the particular configuration of outer circumferential seal surface <b>275</b> of end cap <b>224</b>, for the arrangement shown in FIG. 9, differs from the analogous surface <b>67</b> in the embodiment of FIG. 5. A preferred configuration for surface <b>267</b> (and surface <b>67</b> if applied in the embodiment of FIG. 1) is described hereinbelow in connection with the mold FIG. <b>13</b>.</p>
    <p>Still referring to FIG. 9, end cap <b>224</b> includes a circular recess or trough <b>285</b> therein. Trough <b>285</b>, analogously to trough <b>85</b>, FIG. 5, is sized and configured to receive and sealingly engage bead <b>270</b>. Trough <b>285</b>, which, in the preferred embodiment depicted has somewhat of an inverted “V” configuration (with a rounded apex) when viewed in cross-section, should be sized, relative to bead <b>270</b>, such that when element <b>221</b> is pressed against base <b>263</b>, bead <b>270</b> is pushed into trough <b>285</b> to form a seal therewith, capable of holding a pressure differential at least up to about 2-4 inches of H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
    <p>Analogously to end cap <b>24</b> of the arrangement shown in FIG. 5, end cap <b>224</b> comprises a soft, polymeric material. However, unlike end cap <b>24</b> shown specifically in FIG. 5, end cap <b>224</b> is a composite. In particular, end cap <b>224</b> comprises: section <b>399</b> of compressible, polymeric material <b>400</b>; and, insert <b>401</b>. Advantages which result from the provision of the insert <b>401</b>, as part of the end cap <b>224</b>, will be apparent from further descriptions hereinbelow.</p>
    <p>A more detailed description of the manner of construction, to provide insert <b>401</b>, is also provided hereinbelow. In general, the insert <b>401</b> is secured to the “filter pack” which would typically comprise media <b>225</b> (which is pleated paper in the preferred embodiment shown), inner support <b>226</b>, and outer support <b>227</b>. Supports <b>226</b> and <b>227</b> could comprise, for example, conventional perforated metal or expanded metal media liners. Inner liner <b>226</b> defines inner chamber <b>235</b> (which is cylindrical in the preferred embodiment shown). During assembly, after the filter pack comprising the liners <b>226</b>, <b>227</b> and media <b>225</b> is prepared, insert <b>401</b> would be positioned in one end of that filter pack, closing an end <b>235</b> <i>a </i>of chamber <b>235</b>. The assembly comprising a filter pack and insert would then be potted within the polymeric material which is then cured to form material <b>400</b>, FIG. <b>9</b>. In a typical operation, this potting would be achieved by positioning the filter pack and insert <b>401</b> in an appropriate mold and distributing within the mold the uncured polymeric material, which is then cured. As a result of the process, again described in more detail below, the insert <b>401</b> becomes permanently embedded within the material <b>400</b>, to become secured within the filter element <b>221</b> (between material <b>400</b> and liner <b>226</b>) as a part of the composite end cap <b>224</b>. In the final product, region <b>400</b> covers an underside of insert <b>401</b>, except in some instances for selected portions as described below.</p>
    <p>Attention is now directed to FIGS. 10 and 11 in which the details of the preferred insert <b>401</b> are depicted in detail, and from which advantages which result from utilization of the insert <b>401</b> can be understood. Referring first to FIG. 10, which is a top plan view of the insert <b>401</b>, the insert <b>401</b> has an outer perimeter <b>410</b> (circular in the preferred embodiment shown) with depending legs <b>411</b>. The specific insert <b>401</b> depicted in FIG. 10 includes twelve evenly radially (i.e., separated radially by 30°) spaced legs <b>411</b>, each of which terminates in a foot <b>412</b>. Of course, alternate numbers and specific configurations of legs <b>411</b> and feet <b>412</b> may be used.</p>
    <p>In general, insert <b>401</b> includes an upper surface <b>415</b>, FIG. 10, and an opposite, bottom surface or lower surface <b>416</b>, FIG. <b>11</b>.</p>
    <p>In general, upper surface <b>415</b> of insert <b>401</b> will, when element <b>221</b> is assembled, generally comprise the inner surface of composite end cap <b>224</b>. Thus, surface <b>415</b> will include thereon the inner drainage surface for directing fluid to central aperture <b>296</b> in element <b>224</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 11, insert <b>401</b> includes, on surface <b>415</b>, an apex or upper ridge <b>420</b>. Ridge <b>420</b> is preferably a perimeter ridge, and is circular. Preferably surface <b>415</b> includes funnel section <b>421</b> therein, tapering downwardly from apex or ridge <b>420</b> to central drainage aperture <b>422</b>. A downward taper of 2 to 6°, typically 4°, will be preferred. Aperture <b>422</b> forms drainage aperture <b>296</b>, FIG. 9, in element <b>221</b>. As with aperture <b>96</b>, FIG. 5, aperture <b>422</b> is substantially smaller in internal dimension, i.e., diameter if round, than an internal dimension (diameter) of internal volume <b>235</b>. Preferably, as with aperture <b>296</b>, aperture <b>422</b> is circular, having a diameter within a range of about 0.12-1 inch, typically about 0.47 inches, whereas an internal diameter of inner liner <b>226</b> is typically 6-8.5 inches, typically, 6.02, 7.78, or 8.43 inches.</p>
    <p>Referring again to FIG. 10, insert <b>401</b> includes standing ribs or ridges <b>425</b>. The ridges <b>425</b> are directed generally from outer perimeter <b>410</b> toward aperture <b>422</b>. No ridge <b>425</b>, however, extends completely to aperture <b>422</b>, in the preferred embodiment shown.</p>
    <p>Also in the preferred embodiment shown, ridges <b>425</b> form pairs comprising two sets of channels or troughs: troughs <b>428</b>, of which there are four depicted in the preferred embodiment; and, troughs <b>429</b>, of which there are also four in the preferred embodiment shown. For the preferred embodiment shown, troughs <b>428</b> are identical to one another, and are separated radially by 90°. Troughs <b>429</b> are also identical to one another and are separated radially by 90°. Each one of troughs <b>429</b> is evenly spaced between two adjacent ones of troughs <b>428</b>. Each of troughs <b>429</b> and <b>428</b> comprises a pair of ridges <b>425</b>.</p>
    <p>Troughs <b>428</b> differ from troughs <b>429</b> in that troughs <b>428</b> are longer; that is, troughs <b>428</b> extend a greater percentage of the distance toward aperture <b>422</b> from perimeter ridge <b>420</b>. Troughs <b>429</b> are shorter (in elongated extension), primarily in order to leave open spaces <b>431</b> for liquid flow on surface <b>415</b> toward aperture <b>422</b>.</p>
    <p>Between the ridges <b>425</b> defining any given trough, <b>428</b>, <b>429</b>, an aperture hole through insert <b>401</b> is provided. Thus, there are two sets of apertures: apertures <b>433</b> in troughs <b>428</b>; and, apertures <b>434</b> in troughs <b>429</b>. Apertures <b>433</b> and <b>434</b> are generally oval-shaped, and act as free rise apertures to allow for free rise of polymeric material <b>400</b> therethrough, during the molding process. This helps secure the insert <b>401</b> as part of the composite end cap <b>224</b>. It also facilitates a controlled molding process, as described below. The ridges <b>425</b> help contain the rising polymeric material <b>400</b>, during the molding process, in part to maintain substantial portions of surface <b>415</b> open, for free fluid flow thereacross.</p>
    <p>Note that as a result of the ridges <b>425</b> being raised above surface <b>415</b>, improvement in liquid flow across surface <b>415</b> is provided. This is in part because leaf material, paper material, etc., which settles into element <b>221</b> may, at least in some instances, be supported above surface <b>415</b> by the ridges <b>425</b>.</p>
    <p>Attention is now directed to FIG. <b>11</b>. From FIG. 11, it can be understood that depending legs <b>411</b> generally bow outwardly from ridge <b>420</b>, depending from surface <b>416</b>. Preferably, each leg <b>411</b> is about 0.625 inches long in extension between ridge <b>420</b> to the bottom tip of beads <b>440</b>, FIG. <b>11</b>.</p>
    <p>Preferably an outer radius defined by the perimeter of the legs at regions <b>430</b>, is slightly larger than the inner dimension (diameter) of liner <b>235</b>; and, legs <b>411</b> are sufficiently thin to flex inwardly somewhat, when pressed into an end of inner liner <b>235</b>, during assembly. This “spring” effect can be used to temporarily secure insert <b>401</b> to liner <b>235</b> in the filter pack, during the molding operation, as described below. Preferably, the outer radius of the legs at regions <b>430</b> is about 0.25 inches.</p>
    <p>Each leg <b>411</b> extends slightly outwardly from the vertical. This is to help facilitate manufacturing of the insert <b>401</b>, so that it may be more easily pulled from its mold. Preferably, each leg <b>411</b> extends at an angle of about 5° from vertical.</p>
    <p>Each leg <b>411</b> includes a tapered rib <b>413</b> extending therefrom. Each rib <b>413</b> extends from just above an upper surface <b>441</b> of each foot <b>412</b> to just below the radiussed surface <b>430</b>. Ribs <b>413</b> help to temporarily secure insert <b>401</b> to liner <b>235</b> in the filter pack, during the molding operation, as described below. Preferably, each rib <b>413</b> is about 60 thousandths of inch thick, and extends a length of about 0.3 inches. Each rib <b>413</b> extends about 1° from vertical.</p>
    <p>Still referring to FIG. 11, each foot <b>412</b> includes a bottom bead <b>440</b> thereon. The bottom bead <b>440</b> operates as a mold stand-off, during molding. In particular, bottom beads <b>440</b> will support a reminder of insert <b>401</b> above a lower surface of a mold, during a molding operation, to help ensure that a remainder of insert <b>401</b> will be embedded within the resin, during the molding operation. After molding, beads <b>440</b> will either be slightly exposed in the molded end cap, or they will be covered by a thin layer of molded material, depending upon the molding operation. Either condition is acceptable. Preferably, each bead <b>440</b> extends at a radius of about 0.06 inches.</p>
    <p>Each foot also includes an upper surface <b>441</b>. The upper surface is preferably at least 0.375 inches long, and, during assembly, will extend beyond the filter pack inner liner <b>235</b> to positions underneath the filter media <b>225</b>. As a result of being positioned underneath the filter media <b>225</b> during assembly with a filter pack, upper surfaces <b>441</b> of the feet <b>412</b> will operate as media stand-offs, during molding. This will prevent the media <b>225</b> from dropping all the way to the bottom of the mold cavity.</p>
    <p>Still referring to FIG. 11, attention is directed to a portion of surface <b>416</b> which circumscribes aperture <b>422</b>. That portion or region is indicated generally at reference numeral <b>450</b>. Within this region is located a circular trench <b>451</b>. (Circular when viewed in bottom plan view.) The circular trench <b>451</b> preferably has a semi-circular cross-section as shown in FIG. 11, although alternative configurations can be used. During the molding operation, trench <b>451</b> will be aligned with, and receive, a bead in the mold. This will inhibit, during molding, flow of resin along the direction indicated generally by arrows <b>452</b>, past surface <b>450</b> and into aperture <b>422</b>. The result will be an inhibition of polymeric flash at, or in, aperture <b>422</b>.</p>
    <p>As a result, it is anticipated that after a molding operation, certain portions of surface <b>450</b>, indicated generally at <b>455</b> between trough <b>451</b> and aperture <b>422</b>, will generally be exposed, except perhaps for some small amount of flash from the molding operation. The exposed surface <b>455</b> is viewable in FIG. 14, a bottom plan view of element <b>221</b>.</p>
    <p>Advantages to a composite end cap <b>224</b> including an insert such as that shown in FIGS. 10 and 11, result from at least two related concerns. First, it is anticipated that insert <b>401</b> will typically be manufactured from a material that can be molded, for example a molded, rigid, polystyrene or similar material. As a result of such a molding, specific configurations can be readily provided to surface <b>415</b> to achieve advantageous fluid flow effects and similar effects without relying upon control of conditions used to mold material <b>399</b>, <b>400</b>. Thus, the surface features of surface <b>415</b> are not achieved during the same operation in which the soft, polymeric material for the remainder of end cap <b>224</b>, i.e., material <b>400</b>, is formed.</p>
    <p>In addition, the molding process to provide for polymeric material <b>400</b> is facilitated. This is because a “closed mold” process is not required. Rather, free rise of the polymeric material <b>399</b> is accommodated because insert <b>401</b>, including apertures <b>433</b> and ridges <b>425</b>, will control and direct rise. The free rise will not effect the downward slant in regions <b>421</b>, to achieve a desirable drainage effect in insert <b>401</b>, since the inner surface <b>415</b> of the end cap <b>224</b> is pre-formed.</p>
    <p>In general, when the end cap <b>424</b> comprises a composite of an insert <b>401</b> and polymeric material <b>400</b> as described herein, the polymeric material may comprise the preferred polyurethane described in application U.S. Ser. No. 08/742,244, and previously herein, molded end or similar conditions.</p>
    <p>However, preferably the urethane comprises a material made with Elastofoam I36070R resin and Elastofoam I3050U isocyanate as described below. The material should be mixed as described above, except with I36070R, replacing the I35453R resin. For this material, the mold temperature should preferably be about 105°-150° F.</p>
    <p>The resin material I36070R has the following:</p>
    <p>(a) Average molecular weight</p>
    <p>1) Base polyether polyol=500-15,000</p>
    <p>2) Diols=60-10,000</p>
    <p>3) Triols=500-15,000</p>
    <p>(b) Average functionality</p>
    <p>1) total system=1.5-3.2</p>
    <p>(c) Hydroxyl number</p>
    <p>1) total systems=100-300</p>
    <p>(d) Catalysts</p>
    <p>1) amine=Air Products 0.1-3.0 PPH</p>
    <p>(e) Surfactants</p>
    <p>1) total system=0.1-2.0 PPH</p>
    <p>(f) Water</p>
    <p>1) total system=0.03-3.0 PPH</p>
    <p>(g) Pigments/dyes</p>
    <p>1) total system=1-5% carbon black</p>
    <p>The Elastofoam I3050U isocyanate description is as follows:</p>
    <p>(a) NCO content—22.4-23.4 wt. %</p>
    <p>(b) Viscosity, cps at 25° C.=600-800</p>
    <p>(c) Density=1.21 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>at 25° C.</p>
    <p>(d) Initial boiling pt.—190° C. at 5 mm Hg</p>
    <p>(e) Vapor pressure=0.0002 Hg at 25° C.</p>
    <p>(f) Appearance—colorless liquid</p>
    <p>(g) Flash point (Densky-Martins closed cup)=200° C.</p>
    <p>The materials Elastofoam I36070R and Elastofoam I3050U are available from BASF Corporation, Wyandotte, Mich. 48192.</p>
    <p>Preferably the insert comprises a rigid material, such as molded polystyrene. Of course, a variety of specific configurations and alternatives to the arrangement shown in FIGS. 10 and 11 can be used. However, preferred configurations and dimensions are provided herein.</p>
    <p>With respect to the liner material, no particular preference is made. In general, it is foreseen that the liner will comprise either perforated metal or expanded metal, for example G60 galvanized steel, having a thickness of about 0.03 inches. Such liners are commonly used in other types of large filter elements for trucks, for example.</p>
    <p>As to the filter material, with respect to the principles of the present invention, no particular preference exists. The principles of the present invention can be applied with any of a wide variety of materials. For example, pleated paper or cellulose materials, such as conventionally used in truck filters, may be used. Synthetic materials, or cellulose materials, having synthetic (polymeric or glass) fibers applied thereto, may also be used. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene layers, applied on a surface, or in composites, may be used. In addition, nonwoven fibrous constructions, or composites of nonwoven fibrous media and pleated media, may also be used. Indeed, arrangements not existing and yet to be developed can be accommodated, by composite end caps made according to the processes described herein. This will be apparent, from a more detailed description of the method of assembly.</p>
    <p>In FIG. 12, a schematic representation of a preferred process for manufacturing a filter element according to the composite of FIGS. 9, <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> is provided.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 12, a filter pack is indicated generally at <b>500</b>. The filter pack comprises outer liner <b>227</b>, media <b>225</b>, and inner liner <b>226</b>. The filter pack <b>500</b> is shown aligned to receive insert <b>401</b> therein, with feet <b>411</b> positioned under media <b>225</b>, and with a remainder of insert <b>401</b> positioned within inner chamber <b>235</b>. The combination of filter pack <b>500</b> and insert <b>401</b> would then be positioned within mold <b>501</b>. The appropriate resin mix would be positioned in the mold as well, and cured. Again, free rise conditions for curing are allowable, due in part to the design of insert <b>401</b>.</p>
    <p>Attention is directed to FIG. 13, which indicates a schematic cross-section of a usable mold <b>501</b>. Note the mold includes bead <b>502</b> for engagement with trough <b>451</b> in insert <b>401</b>, FIG. 11, discussed above. Center post <b>503</b> fits through aperture <b>422</b> in insert <b>401</b>, and ensures a proper positioning as well as inhibition of flash within the aperture <b>422</b>. Note the positioning of bead <b>504</b>, which will generate trough <b>285</b>, FIG. <b>9</b>. Also note the positioning of stand-off <b>505</b>, which is formed as a ring in mold <b>501</b>. Stand-off <b>505</b> will receive beads <b>440</b> positioned thereon, during molding. This is illustrated in FIG. 15, schematically, in which insert <b>401</b> is shown positioned within mold <b>501</b>.</p>
    <heading>Some Preferred Dimensions for Arrangements According to FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>15</b> </heading> <p>Consider an air cleaner arrangement such as depicted in FIG. 1 used on a over the highway truck (heavy duty truck). The housing would be about 11-15 inches in diameter and about 32 inches long. The element would be about 9-13 inches in diameter and about 22-26 inches long. The I.D. of the smallest rib on the sealing portion of the end cap with the inlet tube (prior to compression) would be about 5.15 inches. The I.D. of the annular surface in the housing base whereat the radial seal with second end cap occurs would be about 9.52 inches. The O.D. of the largest step on the second end cap, for sealing with the base, would be about 9.64 inches. The bead on the base for engagement with the second end cap would be large enough to extend into the trough on the end cap about 0.35 inches. The declination angle in the second end cap from its outer rim to the recess engaging the bead would be about 1.75°. The declination angle on the inside of the second end cap would be about 4°±2°.</p>
    <p>The standing ribs or ridges <b>425</b> on the insert would have a height of about 0.077 inches, and a thickness at a distal end (free end) of about 0.042 inches. Each of the ridges <b>425</b> between the base proximate to the regions <b>421</b> and the free end would be curved on a radius of about 0.062 inches. The distance between a pair of free ends of two of the ridges would be about 0.4 inches. Apertures <b>433</b> and <b>434</b> would have radii at each respective end of about 0.125 inches.</p>
    <p>Circular trench <b>451</b> would have a semi-circular cross-section. The radius of the cross-section would be about 0.031 inches. The diameter of circular trench <b>451</b> would be about 0.736 inches.</p>
    <p>The diameter for the insert extending from the outermost end tip of one of the feet to the outermost end tip of a diametrically opposite foot would be about 9.265 inches. The diameter of the insert extending from the outermost part of one of the legs (not including the foot) to the outermost part of a diametrically opposite leg (not including the foot) would be about 8.515 inches. The inner radius of each leg <b>411</b> as it bends from a top surface of the insert down toward its foot would be about 0.187 inches. The outer radius of each leg <b>411</b> as it bends from a top surface of the insert down toward its foot would be about 0.25 inches. The radius of each leg <b>411</b> as it bends from its substantially vertically extension to its foot would be about 0.03 inches. The radius of each bead <b>440</b> would be about 0.06 inches. The angle of declination at ramp section <b>453</b> would be about 30° from horizontal, and on a radius of about 0.125 inches.</p>
