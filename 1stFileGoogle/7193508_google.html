<p num="p-0002">This application claims priority to U.S. provisional application 60/544,008, filed Feb. 12, 2004, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading>FIELD</heading> <p num="p-0003">This invention relates to security systems. In particular, this invention relates to portable security systems having self-contained data acquisition, storage, and transfer capabilities, as well as remote control capability.</p>
  <heading>BACKGROUND</heading> <p num="p-0004">The typical construction site includes a variety of valuable items, including equipment, tools and materials. These items are often expensive to replace or repair if damaged by vandals or stolen. In addition, the time required to repair or replace the items can cause a construction project to lag behind it projected schedule. This is a particular concern for construction projects governed by contracts that include penalties for delays, or where progress payments to the construction company are based upon completion of certain phases of the project.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">Construction sites can also be hazardous environments for unauthorized personnel. For example, safety devices such as handrails may not yet be installed. Further, some unfinished structures may appear to be sturdy, but are in fact not yet capable of bearing the weight of a person. In addition, construction crews often leave large openings in walls and floors to facilitate the installation of subsystems such as wiring and plumbing. These openings can cause falls and serious injury to the uninitiated. Thus, there is a desire to secure the construction site to dissuade intruders.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">Portable fencing is often used to secure a construction site. However, fences are easily breached by determined trespassers. One or more guards may be posted at the site, but this is an expensive solution, particularly if round-the-clock security is required. As an alternative, many construction sites include one or more surveillance cameras attached to a stationary object such as a telephone pole. However, the observable range of such cameras is necessarily fixed by the location of the pole. Even the addition of a servomotor mount to remotely reposition the camera may be unsatisfactory if the pole is not located near the area to be secured. In addition, the installation and wiring of such security cameras must be custom-configured to the peculiarities of the site, making installation time-consuming and difficult to move or disassemble when no longer needed.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">Modern construction projects can be complex and involve personnel that are located remotely from the site, even in another state. Examples of such personnel include architects, material suppliers, construction supervisors, and the owner of the project. It is desirable for those personnel to be able to observe the construction site without having to be present at the site.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">Surveillance systems are well-known in the art, such as the trailer-mounted surveillance system disclosed by Kaylor et al. in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 2003/0025791. Such systems are typically employed to provide a means for monitoring a predetermined area. However, surveillance systems, particularly portable surveillance systems, lack the capability to provide security to the area. Thus, while illegal and destructive activities, such as trespassing, theft and vandalism, may be detected by surveillance systems, little can be done to prevent these activities from occurring or to defend against them.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">Others have attempted to provide portable security systems to protect a defined area, such as in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,850,180, 6,049,273 and 6,831,557 to Hess. Such systems monitor alarm inputs, such as motion sensors and wireless switches, and contact a remote control station via a telephone link if a security breach is detected. However, known portable security systems do not provide remote users with the capability of surveilling conditions at a secured site in real-time, obtaining stored monitoring data relating to the site, changing security and monitoring protocols at the site, and actively changing or controlling conditions at the site to deter and/or thwart unauthorized activities.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">There is a need for a portable security system that can be easily transported to a construction site and set up, then easily moved about the site as needed. There is a further need for a portable security system that requires little oversight. There is a still further need for a portable security system to provide visual contact with the construction site by personnel located remotely. There is a yet further need for a portable security system which overcomes the drawbacks of surveillance systems. A further need exists for a portable security system that can detect activity in a particular portion of a field of view and react by automatically providing notification to a designated authority through wired or wireless communication means and providing remotely located personnel with the capability to intervene and deter and/or thwart unauthorized activities.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY</heading> <p num="p-0011">The present invention is a self contained, vandal-resistant portable security system having the capability to monitor a defined area with closed-circuit TV cameras, record the video and retain it for later review and use. The portable security system is mounted in its entirety to a transportable trailer with a collapsible telescopic mast for placement of cameras and other data input devices in a position to view the defined area. The system can be quickly erected and placed into operation. Likewise, it can be quickly stowed for travel.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">The portable security system includes one or more data input devices such as cameras, a trailer with a telescopic mast, a battery power supply, a solar battery charging circuit, a digital video recorder, a server, and controls to activate the system. Data may be downloaded and reviewed using a conventional personal computer.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">The portable security system further includes a cabinet mounted to the trailer that houses a communication subsystem, a data input subsystem, a control subsystem, a data server, a data storage subsystem and an output subsystem. The data server receives and digitally stores video and/or audio data. The server may be configured to overwrite the oldest stored data to conserve memory. In addition, a wired or wireless communication link may be coupled to the communication subsystem to facilitate transfer of various data such as video, audio, alarms, diagnosis, battery status and fault information from the portable security system to remote sites for review and storage. The communication link may also permit remote control of the portable security system, such as camera panning/focus, data uploading/downloading, server control, and activation of various output devices at the site, such as lights, alarms, motorized doors and locks, and so on.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">In various embodiments the portable security system may include wireless Ethernet connectivity, Global Positioning System (GPS) interface with position reporting, cell phone integration for call-out on alarm notification, integration with Passive Infrared (“PIR”) motion detectors and acoustical sensors for alarm inputs, and software growth capability for future functions such as biometric recognition, vehicle recognition, or smoke recognition. The design of the system also enables securing of large areas through use of a plurality of portable security systems networked together. Anti-theft and anti-vandalism protection is also provided to prevent harm to the portable security system by intruders and to preserve the integrity of data stored in the server.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">An object of the present invention is a portable security system. The portable security system includes a wheeled trailer and a telescopic mast that is coupled to the trailer.

Indicator lights <b>42</b> an exterior surface of cabinet <b>30</b> may be included to provide users with a positive indication that portable security system <b>10</b> is on and armed. Data from inputs <b>82</b> (such as cameras <b>28</b>) is acquired and routed to data input subsystem <b>80</b>. Control subsystem <b>50</b> instructs server <b>60</b> to route the data to data storage <b>70</b> for storage. Monitoring personnel at any remote site may then retrieve at least a portion of the stored data at any time for review by issuing a request to control subsystem <b>50</b> in a predetermined format, via communication link <b>36</b> and communications subsystem <b>100</b>. Control subsystem <b>50</b> in turn instructs server <b>60</b> to retrieve the requested data from data storage subsystem <b>70</b> and forward it to communications subsystem <b>100</b> for transmission to the requester.</p>
  <p num="p-0051">In one embodiment data from data storage subsystem <b>70</b>, such as video, can be flexibly reviewed at varying forward and reverse speeds, single paused images, single-stepping forward and reverse a sequence of images, from a specified time and date, from specific events held in an event database portion of the storage subsystem. Data in data storage subsystem can be cleared as desired.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">Alternatively, personnel at a remote location may issue a request to control subsystem <b>50</b> to receive real-time input data. Control subsystem <b>50</b> accordingly instructs server <b>60</b> to forward real-time data received from data input <b>80</b> to communications subsystem <b>100</b>. Communications subsystem <b>100</b> transmits the real time data to the requester via a communication link <b>36</b>. The requested real-time data may concurrently be stored in data storage subsystem <b>70</b>, if desired.</p>
  <p num="p-0053"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–4</figref> may be referred to in combination for the following paragraphs, which detail some example embodiments of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">In one embodiment of the present invention, the data received by data input <b>80</b> may be date and time-stamped to correlate the data to the date and time the data was acquired.</p>
  <p num="p-0055">In another embodiment of the present invention, a motion detector <b>34</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) may be used to detect the presence of unauthorized personnel within a secured area. Motion detector <b>34</b> may be used as a manual or automatic trigger for various system functions, such as directing, focusing and zooming cameras <b>28</b> towards the region of a detected intruder, sounding alarms such as siren <b>122</b>, transmitting alerts to monitoring personnel at remote sites, and activating output devices <b>92</b> such as floodlights <b>124</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">In yet another embodiment, a communication link <b>36</b> may be used to transmit and receive various commands and control functions to and from portable security system <b>10</b>. For example, monitoring personnel at any remote site may issue commands to configure portable security system <b>10</b>, monitor input devices <b>82</b>, activate output devices <b>92</b>, download data from data storage subsystem <b>70</b>, change the instructions used by control <b>50</b>, and reposition cameras <b>28</b>. Similarly, portable security system <b>10</b> may issue system status and component fault information to personnel in a predetermined manner. Example output devices <b>92</b> include, without limitation, sirens <b>122</b>, floodlights <b>124</b>, signaling devices such as strobe lights <b>128</b>, electrically actuated devices <b>130</b> such as doors, gates and latches, visual and aural alarms and annunciators <b>136</b> such as alarm lights and prerecorded messages, camera <b>28</b> focusing and servo-motor positioning devices <b>138</b>, and night vision imaging equipment <b>140</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0057">In still another embodiment, a global positioning satellite (“GPS”) receiver <b>110</b> may be made part of portable security system <b>10</b>. GPS receiver <b>110</b> may be used to provide remote monitoring personnel with various data relating to the installation site for portable security system <b>10</b>, such as position and elevation. Control subsystem <b>50</b> may also be configured to receive and interpret National Marine Electronics Association (“NMEA”) data from GPS receiver <b>110</b>. In various embodiments GPS receiver <b>110</b> can, via determinable user settings, be adapted to report to remote monitoring personnel via communications subsystem <b>100</b> and communication link <b>36</b>, and log in data storage subsystem <b>70</b> the position of portable security system <b>10</b> at predetermined distance and/or time intervals. In addition, GPS data may be used to report to remote monitoring personnel via communication link <b>36</b> when portable security system <b>10</b> is being moved or enters and leaves predetermined areas or zones. GPS receiver <b>110</b> may also be adapted to track the location of portable security system <b>10</b> with reference to predetermined routes, and reporting to monitoring personnel if the portable security system deviates from those routes by a predetermined amount. The present invention may further encode the NMEA positional, directional and speed readings into each individual image header of a camera <b>28</b> image data, enabling moving-map displays on image playback of portable security system <b>10</b> on a remote control <b>120</b>. GPS receiver <b>110</b> may also include conventional Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) capability for greater positional accuracy. Thus, GPS data can be used to continuously track the location of portable security system <b>10</b> both at various points within a particular site and also when the system is being transported between sites. The aforementioned GPS capability may also be used to provide information regarding the accurate location of at least one particular portable security system <b>10</b> in an area-securing arrangement which utilizes a plurality of portable security systems.</p>
  <p num="p-0058">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, portable security system <b>10</b> may include Video Motion Detection (“VMD”) capability. VMD provides the user with the ability to establish security zones over a predetermined portion of the field of view of at least one specific camera <b>28</b>, which can be automatically monitored by the portable security system. When an object such as a person or a vehicle passes through the zone, causing a change in the monitored image, portable security system <b>10</b> may be adapted to detect the change in the image and undertake a predetermined course of action, such as sounding an alarm and/or notifying remote monitoring personnel via wired or wireless communication links <b>36</b>, and/or recording a time notation for the event in a database portion of data storage <b>70</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">Portable security system <b>10</b> can be configured to secure one or more defined zones. Each zone may be identified by a logical user-determined title so that data for each zone may logically ordered at data input subsystem <b>80</b> and/or data storage subsystem <b>70</b>. Various parameters may be established for securing each zone. For example, alarm input signals from input devices <b>82</b> may be used to either trigger an alarm for a particular zone or to inhibit a zone-based alarm. Conditional alarm zones may also be configured, such as requiring two alarm inputs to trigger a zone. Each zone may be linked to any camera <b>28</b> for capturing images of a security breach, or create a text only alarm event entry noting the event by control subsystem <b>50</b> for storage in data storage subsystem <b>70</b>. Each alarm zone may record an event, such as a security breach, as a database entry in data storage subsystem <b>70</b>. Each alarm zone may be configured such that data from input devices <b>82</b> for each zone is recorded a slow rate during secured conditions to conserve battery power and the capacity of data storage subsystem <b>70</b>, and record at a faster rate when a security breach is detected. Each alarm zone may trigger control subsystem <b>50</b> to notify a remote control <b>120</b> and/or law enforcement personnel in the event of a security breach. Each alarm zone may be individually configured to operate on a 24-hour basis night-time only, or a defined period of time. Data for each zone may be segregated within data storage subsystem <b>70</b>, and may be individually archived and/or downloaded for review at a remote control <b>120</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0060">In another embodiment of the present invention, a reference video image of a predetermined portion or zone of an area to be secured may be captured and stored in data storage <b>70</b>. Subsequent images of the zone may then be periodically captured and compared to the stored reference image. Differences between the reference image and the subsequent images may be analyzed and interpreted by control subsystem <b>50</b> in accordance with a set of predetermined instructions, such as a computer program. If the differences fall within predetermined criteria, such as the addition or deletion of particular shapes, changes in lighting, and changes in shading, the analyzed differences may be interpreted as an unauthorized entry, vandalism or theft whereupon portable security system <b>10</b> automatically undertakes a predetermined course of action, such as sounding an alarm and/or notifying remote monitoring personnel via wired or wireless communication links <b>36</b>, or recording a time notation for the event in data storage subsystem <b>70</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">An advantage of portable security system <b>10</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention is a capability for the system to function as a standalone unit without auxiliary power for a period of days, such as about ten days or more, without a need for intervention by users or maintenance personnel. Solar array <b>32</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) may be used to augment power supply <b>40</b> and/or charge batteries in the power supply. In addition, control subsystem <b>50</b> may operate in accordance with a predetermined set of instructions, such as a computer program, to turn off various components of portable security system <b>10</b> when they are not needed. For example, electrical power may be removed from input devices <b>82</b> and cameras <b>28</b> that are not being used. Further, subsystems such as data server <b>60</b> and data storage <b>70</b> may be placed in a standby or “sleep” mode when not needed, in order to conserve power. The various components of portable security system <b>10</b> may be turned on and off by control subsystem <b>50</b> in this fashion as needed to carry out a predetermined security routine while conserving electrical power. Alternatively, various portions of portable security system <b>10</b> may be turned on and off by either local control or remote control by a user via a wired or wireless communication link <b>36</b>. Other power conservation strategies include extending the operational life of batteries <b>33</b> by controlling components within the security system and/or ancillary equipment attached to the system. For example, portable security system can be configured to turn off after a predetermined period of time, when batteries <b>33</b> reach a threshold set nominal voltage or a threshold discharge voltage.</p>
  <p num="p-0062">Portable security system <b>10</b> may be configured with various self-defense capabilities to prevent theft of the system or damage, as well as fending off attempts to defeat the system. For example, cameras <b>28</b> and motion detectors <b>34</b> may be used to monitor for the presence of unauthorized personnel in proximity to portable security system <b>10</b> and undertake a predetermined course of action, such as sounding an alarm and contacting remote monitoring personnel via wired or wireless communication link <b>36</b>. Additional sensors including, without limitation, audio pickups <b>126</b>, infrared links <b>132</b> and vibration/shock detectors <b>134</b> may also be used to detect the presence of unauthorized personnel proximate portable security system <b>10</b> and/or attempts to tamper with the portable security system.</p>
  <p num="p-0063">A particular advantage of an embodiment of the present invention is its capability for reconfiguration. Various operational parameters of portable security system <b>10</b> may be added deleted and changed as needed by appropriate modification of the instructions utilized by control subsystem <b>50</b>. Operational parameters include, without limitation, areas that are defined as security zones, selection of input devices <b>82</b>, power control and management, types and frequency of data acquisition, control of output devices <b>92</b>, types and timing of reports transmitted to remote sites, data storage upload/download, and operational instructions. Thus, the operational aspects of portable security system <b>10</b> as described herein may be configured to provide remote accessibility, as well as providing the portable security system with a wide range of options for reconfiguration of operational characteristics such that the operation of the portable security system can be tailored to the needs of a particular site to be secured or modified as the needs of the secured site change.</p>
  <p num="p-0064">Portable security system <b>10</b> may be configured and/or reconfigured remotely. For example, a conventional network or PPP link may be used. In addition, portable security system <b>10</b> can provide diagnostics and debug information via the network connection or PPP dial up. In one embodiment the configuration parameters of portable security system <b>10</b> may be set and/or changed using a set of web pages that can be accessed by a network PC using a web browser. Control subsystem <b>50</b> may be controlled externally by means of conventional Common Gateway Interface (“CGI”) interface commands, enabling integration with various software control packages.</p>
  <p num="p-0065">Similarly, the operational parameters of portable security system <b>10</b> may be reconfigured locally by a user by means of a local port <b>104</b> of communications subsystem <b>100</b>. Local port <b>104</b> may be a conventional computer parallel or serial interface, such as RS232, and may be located within cabinet <b>30</b> for protection from the elements and/or tampering. Alternatively, local port <b>104</b> may be externally accessible through a hinged or detachable cover that is lockable to prevent tampering. Other local control means include, without limitation, analog and digital controls such as potentiometers and switches.</p>
  <p num="p-0066">Likewise, the reconfiguration capability may be used in conjunction with a wired or wireless communication link <b>36</b> to enable troubleshooting, fault isolation and repair of portable security system <b>10</b>. A user may send and receive troubleshooting data to portable security system <b>10</b>, determine a faulty hardware component, remotely electrically disconnect the faulty component, and remotely electrically connect alternate or spare components. Software problems may likewise be analyzed, isolated and repaired from a remote site by downloading software patches, fixes or new programs to portable security system <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0067">Portable security system <b>10</b> may be provided with a wide range of configurability parameters. With one parameter, real-time data from input devices <b>82</b> can be tailored to suit individual needs. For example, data from camera <b>28</b> can be configured for high, medium and low resolution. Use of a lower resolution will reduce the consumption of the capacity of data storage subsystem <b>70</b>, at the expense of image quality. Data stored in data storage subsystem <b>70</b> may be in a standard format compatible with the type of data, such as conventional “MJP” or “AVI” data formats for images, or in a proprietary format. One or more users may remotely access live data at data input subsystem <b>80</b> and or data stored in data storage subsystem <b>70</b>. The live data may be obtained without interrupting storage of the data. A user adjustable rate and duration may be selected, as well as a user adjustable alarm recording rate. Differing recording rates and alarm record rates may be designated for each input device <b>82</b>. User configurable alarm pre-trigger record rates may be selected for individual input devices <b>82</b>, as well as pre-trigger pictures for individual input devices. Data storage subsystem <b>70</b> may optionally include a user configurable ramdisk to store pre-trigger pictures. A user configurable recorded image resolution may be selected based on the number of pixels sampled. A user configurable recorded image target file size in bytes may be selected. Portable security system <b>10</b> may be configured with a predetermined video expiry period, and automatically exclude images that have expired. This conforms to a requirement of some jurisdictions that image data is not to be stored for longer than a set period.</p>
  <p num="p-0068">While portable security system <b>10</b> provides a capable surveillance platform, a key advantage of the system is its additional capability to secure a predetermined area so as to actively prevent unauthorized personnel from carrying out undesired activities in the secured area. The sensing capabilities of portable security system <b>10</b> are used to detect the presence of unauthorized personnel. Unauthorized personnel may be placed on notice of the portable security system by the activation of various output devices <b>92</b> to drive off the intruder or intruders. Portable security system <b>10</b> may further notify security personnel (such as private security or local police) via communications subsystem <b>100</b> and communication link <b>36</b> to capture persistent intruders. In one embodiment of the present invention, portable security system <b>10</b> may be adapted to forego an annunciated alarm and only alert security personnel (i.e., a “silent alarm”), increasing the chances of capturing the intruders, who may not even be aware of the presence of the portable security system.</p>
  <p num="p-0069">Portable security system <b>10</b> is easily moved about and set up. Installation of the system requires only that it be moved to a convenient location at the site to be secured. Outriggers <b>20</b> are engaged to the ground or other mounting surface to stabilize portable security system <b>10</b>. If the cameras <b>28</b> or other equipment have been removed for transport, they are re-installed. Then, mast <b>22</b> is pivoted to an upright position, secured and extended. Any desired auxiliary power and communication links are coupled to system <b>10</b>, then the system is activated as a “turn-key” to begin securing the area in accordance with a predetermined configuration (i.e., a computer program and associated input and output devices). Since portable security system <b>10</b> may be pre-configured and re-configured either locally or from a remote site as discussed above, the portable security system may be quickly and easily set up and deployed by personnel having a only limited knowledge of how to operate the system. In essence, personnel such as a construction crew may simply transport and set up portable security system <b>10</b> as discussed above, without a need for complex and time-consuming system configuration. Such configuration may be predetermined by a set of instructions, such as a computer program already stored in control subsystem <b>50</b> and/or data storage subsystem <b>70</b>. Alternately, configuration or re-configuration of portable security system <b>10</b> may be accomplished at any time by a user, either locally or at a remote site via wired or wireless communication means <b>36</b>. This capability also allows for tailoring of portable security system <b>10</b> to the characteristics of a particular site, and to change operational parameters of the portable security system as needed, as the characteristics of the site become better known or the characteristics of the site change, such as a demolition or construction site.</p>
  <p num="p-0070">Portable security system <b>10</b> may be used to secure either an interior or exterior site. In many cases, the portable security system will be exposed to the elements. As such, portable security system <b>10</b> is adapted to withstand the extremes or weather, including low and high temperatures, precipitation, and solar energy. Residual heat generated by at least some of the components in cabinet <b>30</b> is used to help warm all of the components during operation in cold temperatures, aiding to keep the components within their rated operating temperature range. A supplemental heating device, controlled by control subsystem <b>50</b>, may optionally be added. Various conventional devices may be employed to maintain the operating temperature of components of the system within a desired range, such as thermostatically-controlled heaters and fans (not shown). The heaters and fans may also be controlled locally by control subsystem <b>50</b> in cooperation with temperature sensors located at one or more points of portable security system <b>10</b> or remotely using wireless communication means <b>36</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0071">A plurality of portable security systems <b>10</b> may be employed to secure a site. Accordingly, a remote control <b>120</b> may be used to monitor and control the plurality of portable security systems <b>10</b> at a particular site or at plurality of sites. In these embodiments of the present invention, each portable security system <b>10</b> of a multi-system arrangement is adapted to transmit and receive signals in a conventional addressed format, such that each portable security system responds only to control signals corresponding to a predetermined address or other unique identifier for that system received via communication link <b>36</b>. Alternatively, a plurality of communication links <b>36</b> may be used to individually communicate with each portable security system <b>10</b>. Remote control <b>120</b> provides means for obtaining data relating to portable security system <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0072">If portable security system <b>10</b> is deployed in an area not having wireless internet service, data from the system can be obtained with a conventional “wireless G” type connection operating in “infrastructure mode.” To accomplish this a user configures communications subsystem <b>100</b> with a wireless Ethernet interface and an associated computer program to operate the Ethernet interface. The Ethernet interface and computer program will survey for available connections and will locate a default “infrastructure” connection. The user then launches a computer program resident on a remote control <b>120</b> and enters the address of the portable security system <b>10</b> to be contacted. The corresponding portable security system <b>10</b> will respond by asking for a username and password. Once the proper user name and password are entered, live and recorded video from portable security system <b>10</b> will be available for viewing and download. If portable security system <b>10</b> is to be used as part of a networked hub, it can be combined with other like units to secure a large area, perimeter, or a line of sight such as a border or property line. Each portable security system <b>10</b> can be programmed with a specific IP address and can be monitored or interrogated from a remote position. By using multiple portable security systems <b>10</b>, a large area can be secured.</p>
  <p num="p-0073">If portable security system <b>10</b> is deployed in an area having internet service, data can be sent to and received from the system via a standard “Wireless G” type communication link <b>36</b> operating in “infrastructure mode.” To accomplish this a user configures communications subsystem <b>100</b> with a wireless Ethernet interface. Communications subsystem <b>100</b> is configured with a fixed address that can be accessed via the internet. The user then launches a computer program on a remote control <b>120</b> connected to the internet and enters the address of the portable security system <b>10</b> to be contacted. The selected portable security system <b>10</b> will then respond by asking for a user name and password. Once the proper user name and password are entered, live and stored data, such as video data, will be available for viewing and download from virtually anywhere in the world. A similar connection can be configured by use of a wireless modem.</p>
  <p num="p-0074">Some cities and urban areas are now being supplied with relatively long-range wireless Ethernet service. The area of service of one of these access points is generally referred to as a “Hot Zone.” With a portable security system <b>10</b> deployed within one of these areas, data can be sent to and received from one or more portable security systems after making arrangements with the provider of the hot zone to utilize the service. Once access to the hot zone is available, data can be sent to and received from security systems <b>10</b> over the internet. The user launches an associated computer program on a remote control <b>120</b> connected to the internet and enters the address of the portable security system <b>10</b> to be contacted. Portable security system <b>10</b> will respond by asking for a user name and password. Once the proper user name and password are entered, data such as live and recorded video will be available for viewing and download from virtually anywhere in the world.</p>
  <p num="p-0075">In another embodiment of the present invention portable security system <b>10</b> may be adapted to operate autonomously in accordance with a predetermined set of instructions, such as a computer program. Aspects of autonomous operation may include, without limitation, operation in accordance with a predetermined configuration, automatically altering operational aspects of portable security system <b>10</b> in response to external stimuli such as changes in the status of input devices <b>82</b>, automatically detecting, isolating and repairing internal faults, and automatically altering operational aspects in response to internal conditions, such as temperature and battery capacity.</p>
  <p num="p-0076">Portable security system <b>10</b> can be variously configured to send data to a remote control <b>120</b> upon the occurrence of an event, such as an alarm input, at a set time, at set data storage capacity levels, or whenever the system is connected to a remote control.</p>
  <p num="p-0077">Portable security system <b>10</b> can be configured to maintain log files relating to operational parameters, all connections to the system from remote controls <b>120</b>, illegal attempts to access data, all web pages of the system, e-mails, sent messages, received SMS messages, and FTP downloads. Portable security system <b>10</b> may also maintain an anonymous FTP log of all anonymous FTP logs.</p>
  <p num="p-0078">Portable security system <b>10</b> may also be used as a support tool for a construction project. As previously discussed, remotely-located personnel, such as engineers and architects, may utilize portable security system <b>10</b> to monitor activities and progress at the site, either in real-time or from data stored in data storage subsystem <b>70</b>. If problems arise at the site, remotely-located personnel may use portable security system <b>10</b> to gather data needed to resolve the problem. For example, if there are apparent defects in building materials delivered by a supplier, remotely located personnel may use a video input from a camera <b>28</b> to inspect the materials and make a determination as to their acceptability, thereby minimizing time delays caused by a need for the personnel to travel to the site and inspect the materials. Other support-related activities utilizing portable security system <b>10</b> may include use as a “site management tool” to keep records of crew arrivals, departures and activities, as well as material deliveries and consumption.</p>
  <p num="p-0079">While this invention has been shown and described with respect to a detailed embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail thereof may be made without departing from the scope of the claims of the invention.</p>
