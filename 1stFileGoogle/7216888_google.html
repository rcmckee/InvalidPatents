One embodiment of a ski binding includes a toe receiving member and a releasable system. The toe receiving member is configured to engage the toe portion of the boot. The releasable system is configured to couple the toe receiving member to the ski in at least two independent operational states. A first state corresponds to a state in which the toe receiving member is allowed to freely rotate with respect to the ski. The first state is particularly useful in minimizing the necessary energy output for uphill travel. A second state corresponds to a state in which the toe receiving member is locked with respect to the ski. The second state is particularly useful in high performance downhill travel. The releasable system further includes an engagement mechanism and a switching mechanism. Additional states may also be included such as a third state in which both the toe receiving member and a heel portion of the boot are fixed with respect to the ski.</div>

<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0002">The invention generally relates to binding systems. In particular, the invention relates to multi-state binding systems.</p>
  <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">A binding is used to couple or retain a user's foot to a particular object. Bindings are commonly used in athletic activities that incorporate an underfoot platform. These activities include skiing, snowboarding, surfing, wakeboarding, kiteboarding, skateboarding, etc. Various features and systems are incorporated into bindings depending on the particular activity for which they are primarily designed. These features may include states of operation, releasable responses, switching mechanisms, and various response characteristics. States of operation refer to a feature in which a binding may be configured to switch between different functions and/or states of operation that provide independent characteristics. For example, an Alpine Touring binding includes a free pivoting tour state and a restrained locked ski state. Releasable responses refer to various releasable mechanisms incorporated on a binding. For example, a releasable system may be incorporated on a ski binding to automatically disengage a boot from a ski in response to a particular force. Switching mechanisms refer to systems that switch or control the characteristics of a binding. For example, a switching device may be configured to enable a user to increase biasing forces or switch between states of operation. Response characteristics refer to any type of response or transfer of forces from a user's foot to the platform upon which it is bound.</p>
  <p num="p-0004">Ski bindings in particular are designed to retain a user's boot to a ski in an optimal skiing position. The optimal position depends on the user and the particular subset of skiing in which they are engaged. Downhill skiing requires that a user's boot be retained to a ski at both the toe and heel. Whereas, Telemark and Cross-country skiing require only a portion of the boot to be coupled to the ski thereby allowing the boot to rotate or pivot with respect to the ski. Other activities such as Alpine Touring or Randonee skiing require a binding that can switch between two states of operation to accommodate both uphill and downhill travel. The uphill state must allow the boot to pivot with respect to the ski while the downhill state preferably retains the boot to the ski at both the toe and heel.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">In addition to Alpine Touring, other types of skiing such as Telemark skiing may involve both uphill and downhill travel. The optimal binding characteristics for uphill and downhill travel are dramatically different from one another. Conventional Telemark bindings have generally compromised performance characteristics for uphill travel to provide an optimized binding for downhill travel. A few Telemark bindings have attempted to provide optimal characteristics for both uphill and downhill travel but include inefficient or cumbersome switching mechanisms. Therefore, there is a need in the industry for a skiing binding system that allows for optimal performance in multiple states of operation and includes an efficient and reliable switching mechanism for switching between the states.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0006">The present invention relates to a ski binding that retains a boot to a ski in at least two independent operational states. One embodiment of a ski binding includes a toe receiving member and a releasable system. The toe receiving member is configured to engage the toe portion of the boot. The releasable system is configured to couple the toe receiving member to the ski in at least two independent operational states. A first state corresponds to a state in which the toe receiving member is allowed to freely rotate with respect to the ski. The first state is particularly useful in minimizing the necessary energy output for uphill travel. A second state corresponds to a state in which the toe receiving member is locked with respect to the ski. The second state is particularly useful in high performance downhill travel. The releasable system further includes an engagement mechanism and a switching mechanism. Additional states may also be included such as a third state in which both the toe receiving member and a heel portion of the boot are fixed with respect to the ski. In one embodiment, the releasable system is configured to engage the second locked state in the event of any form of operational failure including failures resulting from damage to the releasable system or decoupling between the switching mechanism and the engagement mechanism. In a second embodiment, the engagement system includes an under-boot rotatable latching mechanism. In a third embodiment, the switching mechanism is configured to switch between the first and second states in response to a similarly aligned force. In a third embodiment, the binding includes a replaceable flex system that provides a biasing force against the boot as it pivots away from the ski in the second state. In a fourth embodiment, the binding includes a climbing rotation point about which the toe receiving member is free to rotate with respect to the ski in the first state, and a pivot point about which a heel portion of the boot is allowed to pivot with respect to the ski in the second state.</p>

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0017">The present invention relates to a ski binding that retains a boot to a ski in at least two independent operational states. One embodiment of a ski binding includes a toe receiving member and a releasable system. The toe receiving member is configured to engage the toe portion of the boot. The releasable system is configured to couple the toe receiving member to the ski in at least two independent operational states. A first state corresponds to a state in which the toe receiving member is allowed to freely rotate with respect to the ski. The first state is particularly useful in minimizing the necessary energy output for uphill travel. A second state corresponds to a state in which the toe receiving member is locked with respect to the ski. The second state is particularly useful in high performance downhill travel. The releasable system further includes an engagement mechanism and a switching mechanism. Additional states may also be included such as a third state in which both the toe receiving member and a heel portion of the boot are fixed with respect to the ski. In one embodiment, the releasable system is configured to engage the second locked state in the event of any form of operational failure including failures resulting from damage to the releasable system or decoupling between the switching mechanism and the engagement mechanism. In a second embodiment, the engagement system includes an under-boot rotatable latching mechanism. In a third embodiment, the switching mechanism is configured to switch between the first and second states in response to a similarly aligned force. In a third embodiment, the binding includes a replaceable flex system that provides a biasing force against the boot as it pivots away from the ski in the second state. In a fourth embodiment, the binding includes a climbing rotation point about which the toe receiving member is free to rotate with respect to the ski in the first state, and a pivot point about which a heel portion of the boot is allowed to pivot with respect to the ski in the second state. Also, while embodiments of the present invention are directed at ski bindings, it will be appreciated that the teachings of the present invention could be applied to other areas.</p>
  <p num="p-0018">The following terms are defined as follows:</p>
  <p num="p-0019">Under boot—an elevational position located below the surface of the boot. For example, a cable that runs under the sole of the boot is an under-boot cable. A particular lateral position is considered under-boot if it is below the boot at that particular lateral position. Therefore, if the heel portion of the boot is substantially lower than the remainder of the boot, a device disposed below the toe portion of the boot but above or in line with a heel portion of the boot may still be considered under-boot.</p>
  <p num="p-0020">Toe portion of a boot—the region of the boot in front of the location at which the ball of a users foot is disposed. For example, the toe portion of a ski boot would include the duckbill, a toe portion of the sole, and a toe portion of the upper casing.</p>
  <p num="p-0021">Hand replaceable—an item is hand replaceable if it can reasonably be replaced without the use of additional tools.</p>
  <p num="p-0022">Rotation point—a point about which a boot is able to rotate with respect to the ski with little or no resistance.</p>
  <p num="p-0023">Pivot point—a point about which a boot is able to pivot with respect to the ski against a biasing force. A pivoting motion includes the ability to raise the heel portion of a boot with respect to the ski while the toe portion of the boot remains fixed or substantially fixed to the ski.</p>
  <p num="p-0024">Pin line—a standardized boot location corresponding to a particular distance in front of the toe region of the boot. On Telemark 3-pin boots, the pin line is the lengthwise ski location of connection between the boot and the binding.</p>
  <p num="p-0025">Front of the boot—a lateral location corresponding to the forward most portion of a boot; on most ski boots this position is the front portion of the duckbill. However, on non-duckbill boots, the front of the boot may be located closer to the toe box.</p>
  <p num="p-0026">75 mm boot—a boot that complies with the international Telemark boot standard of requiring a 75 mm duckbill toe portion.</p>
  <p num="p-0027">Independent operational states—states in which a boot is coupled to a ski so as to provide independent performance characteristics. For example, a tour/free state refers to an operational state in which a boot is able to rotate with respect to the ski with a minimal amount of frictional resistance. Likewise, a skiing/locked state refers to an independent operational state in which at least a portion of a boot is fixed with respect to the ski.</p>
  <p num="p-0028">Reference is initially made to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which illustrates an exploded view of one embodiment of a binding in accordance with the present invention including a toe receiving member <b>140</b> and a releasable system, designated generally at <b>100</b>. The illustrated binding <b>100</b> includes a base <b>110</b>, a toe receiving member <b>140</b>, a heel attachment system <b>160</b>, and a releasable system (<b>120</b>, <b>150</b>). These components operate together to provide a binding <b>100</b>, which is capable of engaging multiple independent operational states. An operational state is a particular configuration that can be used by a user to configure the binding <b>100</b> to particular performance characteristics. The releasable system further includes a switching mechanism <b>120</b> and an engagement mechanism <b>150</b> to facilitate switching between and engaging the particular operational states. The base <b>110</b> is an elongated member fixably coupled directly to a ski (not shown). The base <b>110</b> provides a platform upon which the other components are configured to operate. In addition, an optional heel base <b>180</b> is included to provide a platform for the heel portion of a boot that is substantially the same height as the toe receiving member's <b>140</b> boot supporting surface. Likewise, a base cover <b>128</b> is included to protect a portion of the base <b>110</b> from debris.</p>
  <p num="p-0029">The toe receiving member <b>140</b> is configured to receive and engage a toe portion of a boot (not shown). Boots are configured in a variety of standardized shapes depending on their particular application including the Telemark 75 mm boot standard. The illustrated toe receiving member <b>140</b> is configured to match the 75 mm boot standard meaning that it is compatible with the majority of existing Telemark boots. However, the teachings of the present invention are consistent with alternatively shaped toe receiving members that are capable of accommodating other boot standards. The toe receiving member <b>140</b> is shaped to releasably engage the toe portion of a boot by matching the shape and allowing the duckbill portion of the boot to slide under a crossbar member.</p>
  <p num="p-0030">The toe receiving member <b>140</b> further includes a toe housing <b>122</b>, a toe base <b>124</b>, and a rotation axle <b>126</b>. As described above, the toe housing <b>122</b> and toe base <b>124</b> are shaped to encircle the toe portion of a boot in a manner to releasably engage the boot. The boot is forced forward by the heel attachment system <b>160</b> therein coupling the boot to the binding <b>100</b>. The toe housing <b>122</b> includes two side members and a crossbar that engages a top portion of the duckbill of a boot. Alternative designs may incorporate flanges or smaller crossbar members that are designed to couple with boots that do not contain a 75 mm duckbill. The toe receiving member <b>140</b> is coupled to the base <b>110</b> via the rotation axle <b>126</b>. The rotation axle <b>126</b> allows the toe housing <b>122</b> and the toe base <b>124</b> to pivot with respect to the base. The toe base <b>124</b> further includes a latch receiving member <b>158</b> which is part of the engagement mechanism <b>150</b>. As will be described in more detail below, when the engagement mechanism is engaged with the toe base <b>124</b>, the toe receiving member is restricted from rotating about the rotation axle <b>126</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0031">The toe receiving member <b>140</b> is coupled to the heel attachment system <b>160</b> via the front cables <b>168</b>. The attachment between the toe receiving member <b>140</b> and the heel attachment system <b>160</b> is accomplished at an under-boot location. Therefore, when the toe receiving member <b>140</b> is restricted from rotating with respect to the base <b>110</b>, the heel attachment system <b>160</b> will be able to pivot about a particular cable exit location on the toe receiving member <b>140</b>. It is important to note that the location of the cable exit location is different from the rotation axle <b>126</b>. The location of the cable exit location/pivot point will be described in more detail in the paragraphs below.</p>
  <p num="p-0032">The switching mechanism <b>120</b> is part of the releasable system that allows the binding <b>100</b> to switch between the independent operational states. The switching mechanism <b>120</b> is disposed at a frontal under-boot location with respect to the toe receiving member <b>140</b>. The frontal location allows a user to easily switch between operational states without reaching behind the binding <b>100</b>. This also provides a user with a convenient visual indicator corresponding to which operational state the binding is currently engaged in. The switching mechanism <b>120</b> generally includes a toggle member <b>102</b>, a switch housing <b>104</b>, and a switch cable <b>106</b>. The switch housing <b>104</b> is fixably coupled to the base <b>110</b> and includes an enclosed channel recess on either side. The toggle member <b>102</b> includes two protrusions that extend into the enclosed channel recesses of the switch housing <b>103</b>. The toggle member <b>102</b> is shaped to pivot about two positions as the protrusions slide along the enclosed channel recess. Therefore, the toggle member <b>102</b> acts as a dual position toggle pivot switch within the switch housing <b>104</b>. The switch cable <b>106</b> is coupled to an underside of the toggle member <b>102</b> such that it is extended or retracted a particular translational distance as the toggle member <b>102</b> pivots within the switch housing <b>104</b>. The pivoting motion of the toggle member <b>102</b> with respect to the switch housing <b>104</b> allows the switching mechanism <b>120</b> to be switched between the operational states with substantially the same directional force. In the illustrated embodiment, this switching force is a downward pushing force but other configurations could be designed such that the switching force is an elevational pulling force, a translational force, or some other similarly aligned force. From a user convenience and efficiency standpoint, it is advantageous to provide a switching mechanism in which the force required to switch between the operational states is directionally aligned.</p>
  <p num="p-0033">The engagement mechanism <b>150</b> is also part of the releasable system that operates with the switching mechanism <b>120</b> to allow the binding <b>100</b> to switch between the operational states. The engagement mechanism <b>150</b> is located at a rear under-boot location with respect to the toe receiving member <b>120</b>. The engagement mechanism <b>150</b> is configured to releasably secure the toe receiving member <b>120</b> to the base <b>110</b> in a fixed operational state. In a free rotation state, the engagement mechanism is configured to allow the toe receiving member <b>120</b> to rotate without interference so as to minimize frictional forces upon the toe receiving member <b>120</b> as it rotates with respect to the base <b>110</b>. The engagement mechanism <b>150</b> is coupled to the switching mechanism <b>120</b> via the switch cable <b>106</b>. The engagement mechanism <b>150</b> includes a latch <b>152</b>, a latch receiving member <b>158</b>, a latch axle <b>156</b>, and a latch spring <b>154</b>. The latch <b>152</b> is configured to rotationally hook onto the latch receiving member <b>158</b>. The latch receiving member <b>158</b> is disposed on the toe base <b>124</b> and the latch <b>152</b> is coupled to the base <b>110</b>. Therefore, when the latch <b>152</b> hooks onto the latch receiving member <b>158</b>, toe receiving member <b>120</b> is prevented from rotating about the rotation axle <b>126</b>. As illustrated, the latch <b>152</b> rotates about a latch axle <b>156</b> in a direction substantially parallel to the longest dimension of the base <b>110</b> and ski (not shown).</p>
  <p num="p-0034">The latch <b>152</b> is spring biased into an engaged or hooked position by the latch spring <b>154</b>. The latch spring <b>154</b> is coupled to both the latch <b>152</b> and base in a manner to provide the bias of the latch <b>152</b> towards the engaged position. The switch cable <b>106</b> is routed below and around the base <b>110</b> in a manner to provide a constant downward pulling force on the latch <b>152</b> when the switch is configured to engage the free rotation operational state. A swage/chocking system may be used to couple the switch cable <b>106</b> to the latch <b>152</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0035">The heel attachment system <b>160</b> is coupled to the toe receiving member <b>140</b> to releasably retain the heel portion of a boot. The heel attachment system <b>160</b> is configured to exert a retention force upon the boot which forces the toe portion of the boot <b>140</b> forward effectively engaging the toe receiving member <b>140</b>. In addition, the heel attachment system <b>160</b> extends primarily under the boot of a user. The heel attachment system <b>160</b> further includes a pair of front cables <b>168</b>, a pair of spring cartridges <b>162</b>, a rear cable <b>164</b>, and a heel throw <b>166</b>. The heel attachment system <b>160</b> also acts as a biasing system that exerts a biasing force upon a heel portion of the boot as it pivots independently of the toe portion of the boot. Therefore, if the toe portion of the boot is fixed (ie. the toe receiving member <b>140</b> is locked with respect to the base <b>110</b>), the heel is allowed to pivot upward against the biasing force generated by the heel attachment system <b>160</b>. The spring cartridges <b>162</b> act as the biasing elements that generate the biasing force against the heel portion of the boot. The spring cartridges <b>162</b> also exert the retention force to secure the boot into the toe receiving member <b>140</b>. The spring cartridges <b>162</b> include a spring and a cover and may be configured to adjust the amount of force they exert. The inclusion of two spring cartridges <b>162</b>/biasing elements is advantageous in providing consistent biasing forces upon the boot during lateral movements. The spring cartridges <b>162</b> may also be adjustable so as to increase or decrease the amount of biasing force they generate. One type of adjustment system allows for a simple rotation of the cartridge to effectuate the increase or decrease of spring tension depending on the direction or rotation. The spring cartridges <b>162</b> may further include releasable coupling mechanisms for attachment to the front cables <b>168</b> and the rear cables <b>164</b>. These releasable mechanisms allow for the convenient replacement of the spring cartridges <b>162</b>. A cable swage/chocking system may again be used to provide this releasable coupling mechanism between the spring cartridges <b>162</b> and the cables <b>168</b>, <b>164</b>. The replacement system described above allows the spring cartridges <b>162</b> to be reasonably replaceable as opposed to requiring extensive tooling and/or dismemberment. In addition, the spring cartridges <b>162</b> can be designed to be hand replaceable.</p>
  <p num="p-0036">The front cables <b>168</b> are coupled to the toe receiving member <b>140</b> in a manner that allows them to be hand releasable. For example a swage/chocking system can be used such that when the front cables <b>168</b> are not under tension, they can easily be unchocked and disengaged from the toe receiving member <b>140</b>. Naturally, various other coupling systems can be used between the front cables <b>168</b> and the toe receiving member <b>140</b> and remain consistent with the present invention. The front cables <b>168</b> are releasably coupled to the spring cartridges <b>162</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0037">The rear cable <b>164</b> and the heel throw <b>166</b> operate to couple the heel attachment system <b>160</b> to the heel portion of a boot. Almost all boots contain a ledge or protrusion which is commonly used to attach various boot accessories such as a binding. The heel throw <b>166</b> is shaped and configured to hook over a rear protrusion on the boot and allow a user to generate a particular amount of separational force via a lever motion. The generated separational force provides the necessary force to overcome the spring cartridges' retention forces and thereby couple the heel attachment system <b>160</b> to the boot. Likewise, the illustrated heel attachment system <b>160</b> provides a mechanism for releasing the boot from the binding <b>100</b> if particular forces are imposed. It is beneficial to allow a boot to release from a binding so as to prevent or minimize injury to a user.</p>
  <p num="p-0038">Reference is next made to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>7</b>, which illustrate various views of the binding of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in a locked operational state in which the toe receiving member is fixed to the base. The locked operational state refers to a state in which the toe receiving member <b>140</b> is fixed and/or prevented from rotating with respect to the base <b>110</b> and ski. The locked operational state may also be referred to as a ski state, a locked state, a downhill state, a fixed state, or a Telemark state. By locking the toe receiving member <b>140</b> to the base <b>110</b>, the toe portion of a boot is also locked to the base <b>110</b>. However, many boots are designed to articulate or pivot in a manner similar to how a user's foot articulates. It is a natural movement for a user's toe and ball region to remain flush with a surface while the heel is lifted. The locked state is designed to mimic this natural motion. The heel portion of the boot is allowed to pivot with respect to the ski about a particular pivot point <b>172</b>, which substantially corresponds to the ball of a user's foot. The location of the pivot point <b>172</b> is extremely important for skiing performance.</p>
  <p num="p-0039">Telemark skiing by definition involves pivoting a boot with respect to the ski. Using this pivoting to turn a ski in the snow is often referred to as a “Telemark turn”. For downhill skiing purposes, it is desirable to position the pivot point <b>172</b> as close to the ball of a user's foot as possible. Conventional Telemark bindings were forced to balance the benefits of an under ball pivot with the inefficiencies it may produce for uphill travel. Since the binding described herein is a multi-operational state binding, a separate state is dedicated to uphill travel and it is not necessary to compromise the location of the pivot point <b>172</b>. Therefore, the pivot point <b>172</b> is disposed away from the rotation point <b>170</b> by at least 30 mm as designated by <b>174</b>. In addition, the pivot point <b>172</b> is disposed away from the front of a boot by at least 24 mm. And further, the pivot point <b>172</b> is disposed away from the pin line by at least 10 mm.</p>
  <p num="p-0040">In operation, the locked state is engaged by a series of interconnected operations. The specific interrelation of the various components is best illustrated in the cross-sectional view illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The locked state is accomplished by selecting the locked state on the switching mechanism via a downward pushing force in the illustrated embodiment. The switching mechanism is particularly configured to accept the downward force via a ski pole. The locked configuration corresponds to the toggle member <b>102</b> being flush with the switch housing <b>104</b>, as shown. The locked configuration of the switching mechanism extends or releases tension in the switch cable <b>106</b> to the engagement mechanism <b>150</b>. Since the latch <b>152</b> is spring biased into the engaged position, the extension of the switch cable <b>106</b> allows the latch <b>152</b> to hook over the latch receiving member <b>158</b> of the toe receiving member <b>140</b>. It should be noted that if the toe receiving member <b>140</b> is rotated up when switching is executed, it will be necessary to compress the toe receiving member <b>140</b> toward the base <b>110</b>. This compression will forcibly slide the latch receiving member <b>158</b> under the latch <b>152</b> causing engagement. This may also be referred to as a step-in engagement of the locked state.</p>
  <p num="p-0041"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates how the heel attachment system <b>160</b> is able to pivot about the toe receiving member <b>140</b> in the locked state. Since the heel attachment system <b>160</b> is coupled to the toe receiving member <b>140</b> via the front cables <b>168</b>, the articulation point of the front cables <b>168</b> is in effect the pivot point <b>172</b>. The toe receiving member <b>140</b> has been specifically designed to position the pivot point <b>172</b> about a location consistent with optimal downhill Telemark performance. This location is often referred to as a “high performance pivot” in the industry. As the heel portion of the boot pivots, a biasing force is exerted by the biasing system contained in the heel attachment system <b>160</b>. Pivoting causes a particular under-boot distance between the heel of a boot and the toe portion to increase, therein requiring an elongation of the spring cartridges <b>162</b>. Naturally, the further a boot is pivoted away from the ski, the more biasing force will be exerted. In addition, the dual spring cartridges have the ability to exert different biasing forces on the boot if the boot is rotated or articulated to the side in some manner.</p>
  <p num="p-0042">Reference is next made to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>6</b>, and <b>8</b>, which illustrate various views of the binding of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in a free rotation operational state in which the toe receiving member is free to rotate with respect to the base. The free rotation operational state refers to a state in which the toe receiving member is allowed to rotate about a rotation point <b>170</b> with respect to the base <b>110</b> and the ski. The free rotation state may also be referred to as a climbing state, a free state, an uphill state, or a rotational state. By allowing the toe receiving member <b>140</b> to rotate with respect to the base <b>110</b>, the boot is also allowed to freely rotate. It is desirable in many skiing activities to allow a boot to freely rotate with respect to the ski to allow for efficient snow travel and equipment longevity. By allowing the entire boot to rotate, the boot is able to remain substantially rigid thereby preserving its pivoting lifetime for the locked state only.</p>
  <p num="p-0043">In many skiing activities it is necessary to ascend snow covered slopes. If a slope is not too steep, it is most efficient to skin up a slope using a pair of skins affixed to the bottom of the skis. Skinning up as slope includes alternately sliding each ski forward so as to cause an upward movement. It is necessary for both the front and rear boot to be able to articulate in some manner with respect to the ski. The more a boot is able to rotate with respect to the ski, the less energy is required to generate the forward movements. Therefore, uphill skinning is optimized in an operational state in which the boot is allowed to rotate free with respect to the ski about a rotation point <b>170</b>. Free rotation includes minimizing biasing and frictional forces that would restrict a boot from rotating with respect to the ski. In addition, the rotation range is another factor in uphill skinning performance. For example, a binding that allows a boot to rotate 70 degrees will require more force to ascend a slope than a binding which allows a boot to rotate 90 degrees. Therefore, the rotation point <b>170</b> is positioned to maximize rotational freedom.</p>
  <p num="p-0044">In operation, the free state is engaged by a series of interconnected operations. The specific interrelation of the various components is best illustrated in the cross-sectional view illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The free state is accomplished by selecting the free state on the switching mechanism via a downward pushing force in the illustrated embodiment. The switching mechanism is particularly configured to accept the downward force via a ski pole. The locked configuration corresponds to the toggle member <b>102</b> being rotated out away from the switch housing <b>104</b>, as shown. The toggle member <b>102</b> is configured to frictionally engage the free state after receiving the pushing force. The free configuration of the switching mechanism increases tension and/or pulls the switch cable <b>106</b> coupled to the engagement mechanism <b>150</b>. Since the latch <b>152</b> is spring biased into the engaged position, the increased tension of the switch cable <b>106</b> retracts the latch <b>152</b> away from the latch receiving member <b>158</b> located on the toe receiving member <b>140</b>. The latch <b>152</b> is held away from the latch receiving member <b>158</b> by the latch cable <b>106</b>. Therefore, if the latch cable <b>106</b> is severed or the operation of the switch is compromised, the latch <b>152</b> would rotate back into the engaged position causing the binding to assume the locked state. By ensuring that the locked state is the default state of the binding, an operational failure of the releasable system will not result in a complete binding failure.</p>
  <p num="p-0045"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</figref> illustrate the manner in which the toe receiving member <b>140</b> is able to rotate with respect to the base <b>110</b> in the free state. The toe receiving member <b>140</b> rotates about a rotation point <b>170</b> located under-boot from the toe receiving member <b>140</b>. The rotation point <b>170</b> corresponds to the rotation axle <b>126</b> of the toe receiving member. Since the entire boot is allowed to rotate with respect to the base <b>100</b> and ski, the biasing system will not impose a biasing force that restricts the rotation in any way. The heel attachment system <b>160</b> will maintain the retention force on the boot while it rotates about the rotation point <b>170</b> such that the toe portion of the boot is engaged into the toe receiving member <b>140</b>. The latch <b>152</b> is held out of the rotational path of the toe receiving member <b>140</b> such that there is no interference during rotation. The switching mechanism <b>120</b> is designed to maintain a low profile that will not interfere with the rotation of the boot and toe receiving member in the free state.</p>
