A robotic disk pickup head on the pivotal transport tower is encompassed by a set of disk spindle members arranged in a symmetric semi-circular pattern around the central tower, the disk pickup head being connected to the pivotal transport tower with an elevator mechanism for lifting and transporting compact disks among the disk spindle members and any selected one of the stacked recordable disk drive members. The microprocessor concurrently directs the movement of the disk pickup head and the copying of data to the CD-R disks in the disk drive members. After a disk copy operation is completed, the computer software and microprocessor may direct the stacked recordable disk drive members to inspect the burned CD-R disks for copy errors and further direct the disk pickup head to remove and eject defective burned CD-R disks and place properly burned CD-R disks on a specified disk spindle member. The system allows for source data to be read from multiple master compact disks inserted in specified stacked recordable disk drive members to provide for random access copying from the multiple master compact disks.</div>

    <heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading> <p>This application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/152,815, filed Sep. 14, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,141,198, issued Oct. 31, 2000, which is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 08/816,257, filed Mar. 13, 1997, abandoned.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Digital compact disks were originally conceived in the early 1980's as a technique to accurately copy and preserve audio recordings intended for sale to a mass market of consumers. As computing power has increased exponentially since that time, information processing tasks unthinkable only a few years ago have become commonplace and require large amounts of data most economically and conveniently stored on digital compact disks.</p>
    <p>Until recently the transfer of data onto compact digital disks was a costly procedure economically feasible only when manufacturing a large quantity of copies. Users whose applications required relatively few copies or required frequent data updates could not reap the benefits of this technology, even though lowcost disk-readers were readily available.</p>
    <p>The advent of recordable digital compact disks, generally referred to as “CD-R” disks, was intended to allow users to record their own disks and thereby achieve significant savings. Unlike a common compact disk that has been pressed by a mold, a CD-R has a dye layer that is etched by a laser contained in the CD-R disk drive. Once etched, the “burned” CD-R disk is unalterable and will retain data for approximately 75 years.</p>
    <p>Several practical problems have prevented CD-R users from attaining maximal efficiency in the copy process, especially when attempting to make multiple disk copies in a short amount of time. The primary problem occurring in this situation is that the data throughput from the data source, such as a file on a hard disk drive or a master compact digital disk, to the write head of the CD-R drive is interrupted during the copy process. Many times when this occurs the data buffer to the write head of the CD-R drive is exhausted and null data is written onto the CD-R disk, making the CD-R disk irrevocably defective.</p>
    <p>The frequency of such a defective CD-R disk write increases at least linearly as the drive speed of the CD-R writing head is increased. The industry standard speed is approximately 150K Bytes per second. Some CD-R disk drives can write data at four times this standard speed, but while this increased speed lowers the total copying time, the frequency of defective CD-R disk writes increases as data throughput from the data source is increased.</p>
    <p>An additional problem in a volume copying process is the necessity for direct human supervision to prepare CD-R disks for copying, remove the disks from the CD-R disk writer once copying is complete, and then prepare the disks for inspection to ensure no defective CD-R disks are retained in the completed set of copies. Aside from the tedium involved that may indirectly add errors, requiring human attention in this process adds a significant labor cost that is added to the end-user price.</p>
    <p>The copy speed versus accuracy problem described above is solved when the CD-R disk writer is configured to concurrently copy the data onto multiple CD-R disks. For example, the total copy time for two CD-R disk drives concurrently copying data at 150K Bytes per second is the same as one CD-R disk drive serially copying two CD-R disks at 300K Bytes per second, and the frequency of disk write errors using the concurrent disk drives is approximately half that of the serial disk drive.</p>
    <p>This system uses the concurrent copying method described above and also eliminates the necessity of direct human supervision of the copy process through the unique circular arrangement of CD-R disk spindle members around a pivotal transport tower containing a disk pickup head that lifts a blank disk from a disk spindle member and transports the disk to one of the available stacked CD-R disk drives. After the recording process is complete the disk pickup head retrieves and transports the burned CD-R disk copy to a specified disk spindle member for copied disks.</p>
    <p>The electrical and physical configuration of this system provides several additional benefits to users. The semi-circular arrangement of disk spindle members around the pivotal transport tower minimizes the number of moving parts needed to construct the disk transport assembly. A system having more disk spindle members can be constructed by increasing the radius of the circle formed by the disk spindle members. Similarly, the arrangement of two stacked sets of recordable disk drives allows for a scaleable design permitting the user to make low-cost upgrades.</p>
    <p>Prior disk copy methods only provided for lineal copying of a single source disk. The configuration of this system allows for several master compact disks to be transportable by the disk hub to a selected disk read head so that the copy process from the master compact disks is a random access process.</p>
    <p>Yet another benefit provided by this system is the system's ability to test burned CD-R disks for disk write errors, and through use of the pivotal transport tower, eject a defective CD-R disk isolating the defective CD-R disks from the set of properly burned CD-R disks.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The programmable, automatic compact disk duplication system of this invention includes a copy unit, a host computer, and computer software. The host computer and computer software provide an interface allowing the user to pre-program the copy unit to perform a completely unattended copy and data verification operation upon blank CD-R disks pre-loaded in the copy unit.</p>
    <p>While not required for operation of the duplication system, it is preferred that the duplication system use an IBM PC-clone running a DOS or Windows operating system so that users need not purchase additional computer hardware to operate the duplication system. Hardware-specific computer components necessary to describe the duplication system will reference IBM PC and Windows specifications; however the duplication system is not intended to remain limited to these specifications and a designer skilled in the art would be able to translate these specifications into hardware and software equivalents for systems using Apple, UNIX, or IBM protocols.</p>
    <p>The Copy Unit</p>
    <p>The copy unit has a main copy assembly with an external vacuum pump. The primary components inside a housing for the main copy assembly include a microprocessor, a set of disk spindle members, a pivotal transport tower, a data transfer unit, a vacuum regulator and an air filtration unit. The external vacuum pump is connected to the vacuum regulator by an air hose leading to a disk suction pickup unit affixed to the pivotal transport tower.</p>
    <p>1. The Microprocessor</p>
    <p>The microprocessor is an internal control unit for the copy unit and is electrically connected to the host computer, the pivotal transport tower, and all CD-R disk drive heads. In the preferred embodiment, a 8031 microprocessor is used, but any 8-bit microprocessor capable of processing a command set of about 20 commands could be used.</p>
    <p>The microprocessor receives user input generated by the software that is executed on the user's host computer. The computer software processes the user input into a set of ASCII commands sent to microprocessor via an RS-232 interface. The ASCII command set used is a variant of the Trace Mountain protocol that is often used to interface software to hardware copy devices. Commands sent by the computer software to the microprocessor consist of one letter or one letter and two digits.</p>
    <p>Once the microprocessor is sent a command by the host computer, the microprocessor parses the command and sends an electrical signal to the pivotal transport tower.</p>
    <p>Depending on the command sent by the computer software, the microprocessor will transmit back to the computer software a “ready” indication, an echo of the command received, or a status indication that command received was successfully or unsuccessfully executed. This status indication is then interpreted by the computer software into user readable information displayed on the host computer's video output display.</p>
    <p>2. The Disk Spindle Members</p>
    <p>A set of disk spindle members are located on a front horizontal deck of the copy unit. The bottom of each disk spindle member is affixed to the horizontal deck of the copy unit and projects vertically from the deck. The diameter of each disk spindle member is slightly smaller than the center hole of a CD-R disk, allowing for free vertical movement of the CD-R disk when the disk is located on the disk spindle member.</p>
    <p>The disk spindle members are affixed to the horizontal deck of the copy unit along an arc of a circle around the axis of the pivotal transport tower. It is expected that at least two disk spindle members are affixed to the horizontal deck of the copy unit, allowing one disk spindle member to hold blank CD-R disks and the other disk spindle member to hold burned CD-R disks. The radius of the circle is selected such that CD-R disks located on adjoining spindles do not touch each other.</p>
    <p>3. The Pivotal Transport Tower</p>
    <p>The pivotal transport tower is centrally located in the copy unit at the radial center of the arc formed by the disk spindle members. The pivotal transport tower is cylindrically shaped, with a vertically displaceable arm projecting radially from the pivotal transport tower. Inside the pivotal transport tower is an axle along the vertical axis of the pivotal transport tower. The axle is affixed to the base of the pivotal transport tower. Connected to the axle is a first drive motor capable of pivoting the pivotal transport tower about its vertical axis. Control of the first drive motor is also supplied from electrical signals sent by the microprocessor.</p>
    <p>An arm for a disk pickup head projects radially from the pivotal transport tower. One end of the arm is connected to a belt running vertically along the inside of the pivotal transport tower. The bottom of the belt travels around a set of gears that are connected to a second drive motor. When the second drive motor rotates the belt, the arm is raised or lowered depending on the direction of rotation of the belt.</p>
    <p>The other end of the arm supports a disk pickup head which has a disk suction pickup unit. The disk suction pickup unit is triangle-shaped and has a circular aperture located at its apex. The diameter of the aperture is slightly wider than the diameter of a disk spindle member. Located on the underside of the disk suction pickup unit near each vertice of the disk suction pickup unit is one suction member and one rubber stopper member. A sensor also protrudes downward from the underside of the disk suction pickup unit and relays an electrical signal back to the microprocessor indicating the presence of a target disk near the disk suction pickup unit.</p>
    <p>Additionally, during operation of the disk suction pickup unit, RAM memory located in the microprocessor or electrically connected to the microprocessor retains data for each disk spindle member corresponding to the approximate vertical distance the disk suction unit must travel before retrieving a blank CD-R disk or placing a burned CD-R disk back onto the disk spindle member.</p>
    <p>When the disk suction pickup unit is operated, the suction members draw in air, causing the target disk to adhere to the suction members, holding the target disk horizontally against the rubber stopper members.</p>
    <p>The size and placement of the arm and the disk suction pickup unit are chosen so that during a disk pick-up or drop-down operation the selected disk spindle member passes through the aperture as the arm lowers below the top of the selected disk spindle member.</p>
    <p>In a typical disk transport operation, the microprocessor issues a sequential set of electrical signals that are translated into a sequential set of operations performed by the second drive motor, the first drive motor, and the disk suction pickup unit. For example, the following sequential operations controlled by the microprocessor occur when the copy unit transfers the top CD-R disk from a stack of CD-R disks surrounding a selected spindle to the data transfer unit:</p>
    <p>the first drive motor raises the disk suction pickup unit to a height such that all components of the disk suction pickup unit are above the top of all disk spindle members;</p>
    <p>the second drive motor pivots the pivotal transport tower to position the disk suction pickup unit over the selected disk spindle member, placing the aperture directly above the disk spindle member;</p>
    <p>the first drive motor lowers the disk suction pickup unit along the disk spindle member until the suction members make contact with the CD-R disk;</p>
    <p>the suction members engage and hold the CD-R disk;</p>
    <p>the first drive motor raises the disk suction pickup unit along the disk spindle member until the CD-R disk held by the suction members is above the top of all disk spindle members;</p>
    <p>the second drive motor pivots the pivotal transport tower, positioning the CD-R disk held by the suction members for transfer into the data transfer unit.</p>
    <p>4. The Data Transfer Unit</p>
    <p>The data transfer unit comprises two stacked disk drive receptacle members and a variable number of stacked recordable disk drive members. The two stacked disk drive receptacle members are affixed on opposite sides of the back horizontal deck of the copy unit and positioned along the arc of the circle formed by the disk spindle members at a distance greater than the diameter of a CD-R disk. Each stacked recordable disk drive member fits in a slotted receptacle member located in one of the two stacked disk drive receptacle members and is positioned on the perimeter of the circle formed by the disk spindle members, making each stacked recordable disk drive member capable of receiving a disk transported by the arm.</p>
    <p>Each stacked recordable disk drive member sends and receives binary data with the computer software via a standard 50-pin SCSI connection between the stacked recordable disk drive member and the host computer. Manual loading and unloading of a CD-R disk in every stacked recordable disk drive member is accomplished through an input-output tray member that is a standard feature of recordable and read-only disk drives; control of the input-output tray member is also communicated through each stacked recordable disk drive member's SCSI connection.</p>
    <p>In the preferred embodiment, the top of the main copy assembly located in the void between the two stacked recordable disk drive members has a disk reject slide that is constructed at a downward angle, allowing the combination of the pivotal transport tower and the two stacked recordable disk drive members to eject defective CD-R disks out of the main copy assembly by dropping them onto the disk reject slide. Gravity pulls the defective CD-R disk downward along disk reject slide and the defective CD-R disk leaves the main copy assembly.</p>
    <p>An additional hardware item easily added to the data transfer unit is a standard disk printer that affixes printed labels or imprints the top side of any burned CD-R disk. In this configuration, the disk printer is placed along the rear wall of the copy unit so that the input/output loading tray of the disk printer opens into the void between the two stacked recordable disk drive members.</p>
    <p>5. The Vacuum Regulator and the External Vacuum Pump</p>
    <p>The vacuum regulator is housed inside the main copy assembly and is connected to the suction members by a set of internal air hose members. An external air hose connects the vacuum regulator to the external vacuum pump that is physically separated from the main copy assembly in order to reduce vibrations inside the main copy assembly. The vacuum regulator maintains a constant pressure vacuum and is controlled by the microprocessor.</p>
    <p>6. The Air Filtration Unit</p>
    <p>The air filtration unit creates a flow of filtered air through the inside of the main copy assembly to significantly reduce CD-R disk read or write errors caused by dust or other contaminants that may be in the air surrounding the duplication system. The air filtration unit comprises a set of electric fan members, an air filter, a set of outflow vents, and an outer cover covering the outside of the main copy assembly. The electric fan members are positioned along the back vertical face of the main copy assembly and when operated draw air into the inside of the main copy assembly.</p>
    <p>Positioned along the inside vertical face of the main copy assembly is an air filter that filters air drawn in by the electric fan members before it can circulate through the inside of the main copy assembly. The filtered air then exits the main copy assembly through the outflow vents.</p>
    <p>The Host Computer</p>
    <p>No particular type of host computer is necessary to support the copy unit and the computer software. A conventional personal computer equipped with a SCSI throughput interface and a hard disk drive capable of retaining an image of the master data will suffice.</p>
    <p>The Computer Software</p>
    <p>In the preferred embodiment, the computer software necessary to direct the data transfer operations is written in the “C” programming language running under a Windows operating system. However, the computer software could be written using any computer language and operating system compatible with the computer used, provided Trace Mountain—type protocols can be sent to the copy unit via an RS-232 or SCSI connection between the host computer and the copy unit.</p>
    <p>These and other features will become apparent from a consideration of the Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p>Referring to FIG. 1, the programmable automatic compact disk duplication system of this invention is designated generally by the reference numeral <b>10</b>. The duplication system <b>10</b> includes a host computer <b>12</b>, shown schematically, connected to a copy unit <b>20</b>. The host computer <b>12</b> comprises a programmable computer that includes computer software for providing a user interface for operating the copying process of the copy unit <b>20</b>. It is to be understood that the host computer may be incorporated into the copy unit <b>20</b> with the copy unit having a keyboard or other input device such as a control panel for managing the operation of the copy unit <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 2, the copy unit <b>20</b> includes an internal microprocessor <b>24</b> that is electrically connected to the host computer <b>12</b> for controlling the electromechanical operations of the copy unit <b>20</b>. The copy unit <b>20</b> is constructed with a housing <b>14</b> having a deck <b>16</b> housing the electronics and drive assemblies, and a cabinet <b>18</b> housing the copying and printing components.</p>
    <p>The deck <b>16</b> has a base platform <b>22</b> for a pivotal transport tower <b>58</b> and a series of disk spindle members <b>52</b> disposed in an arcuate arrangement around the transport tower <b>58</b>. A removable transparent cover <b>59</b>, shown in FIG. 2, encloses the tower <b>58</b> and disk spindle members <b>52</b> to protect the system from dust contamination during operation and allow for functioning of an air filtration circuit as later described.</p>
    <p>In the preferred embodiment of FIGS. 1 and 2, the copy unit <b>20</b> has four disk spindle members <b>52</b>. In such a configuration two of the disk spindle members <b>52</b> may hold blank CD-R disks, one disk spindle member designated as a master disk spindle member <b>52</b> <i>a </i>may hold one or more master compact disks. The remaining disk spindle member is designated as a master output spindle <b>52</b> <i>b </i>and is used to hold the master compact disks after source data has been transferred from the master disk.</p>
    <p>The pivotal transport tower <b>58</b> is located in the center of the arc formed by the disk spindle members <b>52</b> and rotates about its longitudinal axis passing directly through the center of the arc. Attached to the pivotal transport tower <b>58</b> is an arm <b>56</b> that rotates along the arc as the pivotal transport tower <b>58</b> pivots and also travels vertically along the pivotal transport tower <b>58</b>. A vertical aperture <b>64</b> having its center correspond to the arc is located on the arm <b>56</b>.</p>
    <p>As described below, the underside of the arm <b>56</b> has several components allowing the arm <b>56</b> to temporarily affix a compact disk to the underside of the arm <b>56</b> and retain the compact disk as the arm <b>56</b> travels radially or vertically. Other means including mechanical pickup mechanisms may be substituted for the preferred pneumatic unit of the described embodiment.</p>
    <p>In FIG. 2., the arm <b>56</b> is positioned above one disk spindle member that is holding a stack of CD-R disks <b>50</b>. For illustration purposes this disk spindle member is designated as the master disk spindle <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, but it is to be understood that the physical transfer of compact disks from all disk spindle members is identical. At the base of each disk spindle member <b>52</b> is a removable spindle base <b>51</b> allowing the user to insert or remove a stack of compact disks held in place by the disk spindle member <b>52</b>.</p>
    <p>Upon activation of a motor housed inside the copy unit <b>20</b>, the arm <b>56</b> descends with the disk spindle member <b>52</b> passing through the aperture <b>64</b>, until a sensor <b>66</b> located on the underside of the arm <b>56</b> detects the presence of a compact disk <b>50</b>. Then suction supplied by disk suction pickup unit <b>54</b> affixes the compact disk <b>50</b> to the underside of the arm <b>56</b>, the suction remaining constant until the compact disk <b>50</b> is transported to its resting place. The suction then terminates and the compact disk <b>50</b> is released from the arm <b>56</b> by gravitational force.</p>
    <p>Located opposite the disk spindle members <b>52</b> are two sets of stacked disk drive receptacle members <b>82</b>. Each stacked disk drive receptacle member <b>82</b> accepts a standard stacked recordable disk drive member <b>84</b>. Each stacked recordable disk drive member <b>84</b> has an autoloading tray <b>85</b> that, when fully opened, positions the center of a compact disk <b>87</b> along the radius arc defined by the arc of the disk spindle members <b>52</b>. This geometrical configuration allows the arm <b>56</b> to place and retrieve compact disks in any of the stacked recordable disk drive members in the same manner as the arm <b>56</b> places and retrieves compact disks on the disk spindle members <b>52</b>.</p>
    <p>For clarity, in FIG. 2 the components located inside the main copy assembly <b>20</b> are designated schematically by hatched rectangles, and where necessary, detailed drawings of these components are shown in other figures.</p>
    <p>The deck <b>22</b> of the main copy assembly <b>20</b> in box-shaped, having a flat rectangular bottom and sides perpendicular to the bottom. Inside the deck <b>22</b> is a microprocessor <b>24</b> that is connected by an electrical connection <b>26</b> to an RS-232 port <b>28</b>. A stepper motor <b>32</b> receives signals sent by the microprocessor <b>24</b> through an electrical connection <b>30</b>. A shaft <b>34</b> leaving the stepper motor <b>32</b> connects to a gearing unit <b>36</b>. Connected to the gearing unit <b>36</b> is an axle <b>38</b> that rotates when the stepper motor <b>32</b> is engaged. An external air hose <b>74</b> enters an opening in the deck <b>22</b> and terminates at a connection to a vacuum regulator <b>72</b>.</p>
    <p>A female power receptacle <b>40</b> allows for attachment of an electrical cord (not shown) providing standard 120V AC to a transformer <b>44</b> through an electrical line <b>42</b>. As detailed below, the transformer <b>44</b> supplies power to components throughout the main copy assembly <b>20</b>; inside the deck <b>22</b>, the microprocessor <b>24</b> receives power through electrical line <b>46</b> and the stepper motor <b>36</b> receives power through electrical line <b>48</b>.</p>
    <p>Compact disks <b>50</b> sit on the top of the deck <b>22</b> and are held in place by one of the disk spindle members <b>52</b> until retained by the disk suction pickup unit <b>54</b> that is located on the underside of the arm <b>56</b>. An aperture <b>64</b> through the arm <b>56</b> allows the disk suction pickup unit <b>54</b> to travel downward with the selected disk spindle member <b>52</b> passing through the aperture <b>64</b> as the disk suction pickup unit <b>54</b> travels downward below the vertical height of the top of the disk spindle member <b>52</b>.</p>
    <p>The disk suction pickup unit <b>54</b> has suction members <b>60</b> creating sufficient suction to hold one disk against the rubber stopper members <b>62</b> that keep the disk in a horizontal position. The vacuum hose <b>70</b> is positioned along the inside wall of the pivotal transport tower <b>58</b> and one end is connected to the vacuum regulator <b>72</b>. The other end of the vacuum hose <b>70</b> has three connector members <b>71</b> allowing the air flow to branch into each attached suction member <b>60</b>. A sensor <b>66</b> is attached to the disk suction pickup unit <b>54</b> and sends a signal back to the microprocessor indicating the presence of a disk near the disk suction pickup unit <b>54</b>.</p>
    <p>The arm <b>56</b> is affixed to the pivotal transport tower <b>58</b> and rotation of the arm <b>56</b> is accomplished through pivoting of the pivotal transport tower <b>58</b> The other end of the arm <b>56</b> is secured around the axle <b>38</b>, allowing for radial movement of the pivotal transport tower <b>58</b> when the axle <b>38</b> rotates.</p>
    <p>Behind the pivotal transport tower <b>58</b> is the data transfer unit, designated generally by the numeral <b>80</b>. Sitting on each of the two rear corners of the deck <b>22</b> is a stacked disk drive receptacle member <b>82</b> containing slotted receptacles <b>83</b> for holding a variable number of stacked recordable disk drive members <b>84</b>, allowing the user vary the total number of recordable disk drives available to burn disks. Each stacked disk drive receptacle member <b>82</b> can also hold a read-only disk drive permitting very fast transfer of data from master disks.</p>
    <p>The stacked disk drive receptacle members <b>82</b> are placed on top of the deck <b>22</b> along the outside of the perimeter of the circle formed by the disk spindle members <b>52</b> such that the arm <b>56</b> may transfer a disk to the space between the two stacked disk drive receptacle members <b>82</b>. A disk transported to this region may then be inserted into any of the stacked recordable disk drive members <b>84</b> provided the stacked recordable disk drive members <b>84</b> have a standard motorized loading tray <b>85</b>.</p>
    <p>Located at the bottom of the region between the stacked disk drive receptacle members <b>82</b> on the top of the deck <b>22</b> is a disk reject slide <b>92</b> slanting downward out of the rear of the data transfer unit <b>80</b> that receives defective CD-R disks dropped down by the arm <b>56</b> in the region between the stacked disk drive receptacle members <b>82</b>. Defective CD-R disks dropped onto disk reject slide <b>92</b> fall out of the main copy assembly <b>20</b> by gravity.</p>
    <p>The system can also be equipped with an optional print application unit <b>93</b> that is placed behind the stacked disk drive receptacle members and loads and unloads CD-R disks in the space between the two stacked disk drive receptacle members <b>52</b> and directly above the disk reject slide <b>92</b>. In this configuration, the print application unit <b>93</b> is electrically connected to the host computer <b>12</b> and imprints markings or printed labels to the top side of a burned CD-R disk.</p>
    <p>The optional print application unit <b>93</b> is shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B. The print application unit comprises an ink jet printer or a thermal printer to imprint a blank disk with markings or labels. Where disk blanks are previously printed with markings <b>94</b>, such as designs <b>94</b> <i>a</i>, and a label window <b>94</b> <i>b </i>as shown in FIG. 5B, it is necessary to rotate the disk or rotate the virtual bit mapping of the new marking or labels to be added, so that the new printing registers with the pre-existing printing. It is common, for example, for blank CD-R disks to have company names and logo's pre-printed by a silk screening process by the disk supplier or an intermediary. New material may comprise titles or added decorative work requiring registration coordination. Since disks are symmetrical and consistently positioned, proper angular orientation is all that is required to achieve registration.</p>
    <p>In FIG. 5B, a disk <b>95</b> is positioned on retractable printer tray <b>96</b> and is preprinted with an angular registration mark, such as dot mark <b>94</b> <i>C </i>adjacent the hub hole. A digital camera <b>97</b> retrieves a digital image of at least the center portion of the disk, and the limited field area where the mark must necessarily be found is analyzed by a software program to locate the registration dot mark <b>94</b> <i>c </i>and to determine its angular orientation. The virtual image in memory is rotated accordingly before or while the reoriented bit map is printed to disk.</p>
    <p>By use of a simple registration mark positioned in a predetermined annular area, image analysis is greatly simplified and equipment costs are reduced. Furthermore, by consistent placement of the mark with respect to the angular orientation of the original printing, an initial run for image loading of the original printing is avoided.</p>
    <p>When the print application unit is a thermal printer, the newly printed image or markings requires little or no time to cure before the disk can be robotically handled and moved to the output spindle. Ink jet printing requires a bit longer for the deposited ink to dry before handling. Ordinarily, with simple labels and text titles, the limited ink deposit dries during the time another disk is being recorded in a single station duplication system. In a multiple station system as is presently disclosed, accelerated drying is prefereed to insure proper drying.</p>
    <p>In the duplication system of this invention, accelerated drying for ink jet printing is aided by an elongated thermal element <b>98</b> at the lower edge of the partially shrouded opening <b>99</b> of the application unit <b>93</b>. Heated air passing to an external vent member <b>90</b> <i>a </i>at the back top of the print unit <b>93</b> accelerates the drying of the ink. The system is preferably programmed to allow the disk <b>95</b> to remain in the extended tray <b>96</b> as long as possible after printing before pickup by the pickup unit <b>54</b> on the transport tower <b>58</b> and deposit on the output spindle.</p>
    <p>Located at the rear of the stacked disk drive receptacle members <b>82</b> are one or more electric fan members <b>86</b> that draw in air to ventilate the main copy assembly <b>20</b> preventing heat build-up created by the stacked recordable disk drive members <b>84</b>. An air filter <b>88</b> is positioned on the interior rear wall of the data transfer unit <b>80</b> that filters the air drawn in by the electric fan members <b>86</b> before the air travels through the interior of the main copy assembly <b>20</b>. The filtered air then exits the interior of the main copy assembly <b>20</b> through vent members <b>90</b> <i>b </i>located on the deck <b>22</b>.</p>
    <p>In systems having the optional print application unit <b>93</b>, the filtered and warmed air is passed through the printer to exit the auxiliary vent member <b>90</b> <i>a </i>as described. The circulated air aids in drying of the printed disk deposited on the top of the output spindle as well.</p>
    <p>In a system having a mechanical pickup unit that engages the disk hole and does not contact the newly printed surface, the thermal element and programmed delay of pickup may be unnecessary, and drying accomplished by the component warmed air circulated over the printed disk when on the printer tray and on the output spindle.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 3, a side view of the mechanical linkages that allow for movement of the pivotal transport tower is shown. The pivotal transport tower <b>58</b> has a cylindrical outer shell <b>100</b> that is oriented vertically and sits on a circular rotating base <b>102</b>. Affixed to the bottom of the center of the rotating base <b>102</b> is an axle <b>38</b> that allows for radial movement of the pivotal transport tower <b>58</b>.</p>
    <p>The axle <b>104</b> passes through an aperture <b>106</b> in the top of the base platform <b>22</b> and also passes through an aperture <b>108</b> in a horizontal frame member <b>110</b>. The end of the axle <b>38</b> is affixed to the center of a pulley wheel member <b>112</b>. Rotation of the pulley wheel member <b>112</b> is controlled by a belt <b>114</b> surrounding a second pulley wheel member <b>116</b>.</p>
    <p>Affixed to the center of the second pulley wheel member <b>116</b> is one end of an axle <b>118</b>. The other end of the axle <b>118</b> is affixed to the center of a third pulley wheel member <b>120</b>. Rotation of the third pulley wheel member <b>120</b> is controlled by a belt <b>122</b> that also surrounds the perimeter of a fourth pulley wheel member <b>124</b>.</p>
    <p>Rotation of the fourth pulley wheel member <b>124</b> is controlled by one end of a shaft <b>34</b> that is affixed to the center of the fourth pulley wheel <b>124</b>. The other end of the axle <b>34</b> is connected to the stepper motor <b>32</b> that is the source of all rotation of the pivotal transport tower <b>58</b>. Attached to the frame <b>110</b> is an encoder sensor <b>131</b> that is electrically connected to the stepper motor <b>32</b> and prevents over-rotation of the pivotal transport tower <b>58</b>.</p>
    <p>An aperture <b>130</b> through the cylindrical outer shell <b>100</b> allows for movement of the arm <b>56</b> along the vertical axis of the pivotal transport tower <b>58</b>. The back <b>134</b> of the arm <b>56</b> is affixed to a belt <b>132</b> that travels vertically and raises or lowers the arm <b>56</b> as the belt <b>132</b> moves.</p>
    <p>The top end of the belt <b>132</b> travels around a pulley wheel member <b>136</b>. The outer side of the rear face of the belt <b>132</b> makes contact with a pulley wheel member <b>138</b> that makes the rear face of the belt <b>132</b> travel towards the rear of the pivotal transport tower <b>58</b>.</p>
    <p>The inner side of the rear face of the belt <b>132</b> then travels around a pulley wheel member <b>140</b> that is connected to a stepper motor <b>142</b> that rotates the pulley wheel member <b>140</b> when the stepper motor <b>142</b> is engaged.</p>
    <p>The inner side of the rear face of the belt <b>132</b> then travels around a pulley wheel member <b>144</b> that changes the direction of the travel of the belt <b>132</b> back to vertical.</p>
    <p>The stepper motor <b>142</b> is electrically connected to a limit sensor <b>146</b> placed above the pulley wheel member <b>136</b> and disengages the stepper motor <b>142</b> when the limit sensor <b>146</b> detects the presence of a limit flag <b>148</b> placed on the top of the arm <b>56</b>.</p>
    <p>One end of the air line <b>150</b> is connected to a vacuum line valve <b>152</b> that controls the flow of air through the air line <b>150</b>. The air line <b>150</b> travels through the inside of the pivotal transport tower <b>58</b> and through the arm <b>56</b> and the disk suction pickup unit <b>54</b>, with openings connected to each disk suction member <b>60</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIGS. 4A through 4D, a flowchart of the procedures performed in a disk copy operation, are shown. The logic necessary to perform a disk copy operation is programmed into the computer software on the host computer and programmed into the microprocessor located inside the copy unit.</p>
    <p>A user begins a disk copy operation by loading master disks on a disk spindle member designated as the master disk spindle member <b>52</b> <i>a </i>and loading blank recordable disks onto other disk spindle members <b>52</b>. The user then supplies power to the copy unit <b>20</b> and starts the computer software located in the host computer <b>12</b>. These initialization subprocedures are indicated in item step <b>200</b>. A display <b>13</b> connected to the host computer <b>12</b> then prompts the user for information regarding the selection of the master disk spindle <b>52</b> <i>a </i>and the location of the blank CD-R disks. The user also selects a master output spindle <b>52</b> <i>b </i>that will hold master disks after the data transfer from each master disk to the host computer <b>12</b>. The user also supplies instructions indicating the tracks on the master disks to be copied. This operation is indicated in item step <b>210</b>.</p>
    <p>When first powered on, the internal microprocessor <b>24</b> sends electrical signals to test the operation of the arm <b>56</b>, as indicated in item step <b>220</b>. The microprocessor <b>24</b> sends a set of flags back to the computer software to signal the status of the hardware located on the copy unit <b>20</b>, as indicated in item step <b>230</b>. If the computer software receives a status flag indicating hardware failure, the computer software issues a display error message for the user to decode, and the copy process is terminated, as indicated in item step <b>240</b>.</p>
    <p>If the computer software receives status flags indicating the hardware is operational, the computer software sends instructions to the microprocessor that comprise a data acquisition subprocedure. The beginning of the data acquisition subprocedure is indicated in item step <b>250</b> and comprises item steps <b>260</b> through <b>340</b>.</p>
    <p>In item step <b>260</b>, the computer software checks if a disk drive on the host computer contains an image of the master data. If an image file already exists, control of the software is transferred to item step <b>360</b>. Otherwise, control of the computer software is transferred to item step <b>270</b>.</p>
    <p>As indicated in item step <b>270</b>, the computer software first compares the number of disk drives to the number of master disks loaded on the master disk spindle member <b>53</b>. If the number of stacked recordable disk drives <b>84</b> is greater than or equal to the number of master disks, the computer software sends a command set to the microprocessor <b>24</b> to transfer each master disk to an available stacked recordable disk drive <b>84</b>, as indicated in item step <b>280</b>.</p>
    <p>The computer software then sequentially issues read commands to each stacked recordable disk drive <b>84</b> containing a master disk and transfers the source data from each master disk to the host computer <b>12</b>. These commands are summarized in item step <b>290</b>. Once the data transfer process is completed, the computer software sends a command set to the microprocessor to transfer each master disk back to the master output spindle <b>55</b>, as indicated in item step <b>300</b>, and the data acquisition subprocedure is complete.</p>
    <p>If the number of stacked recordable disk drives <b>84</b> is less than the number of master disks, the computer software must loop through item steps <b>310</b> through <b>340</b> until all master disks have been transferred to an available stacked recordable disk drive <b>84</b>.</p>
    <p>This loop begins when the computer software sends a command set to the microprocessor <b>24</b> to transfer the maximum number of remaining uncopied master disks held by the input spindle from the master disk spindle member <b>52</b> <i>a </i>to the stacked recordable disk drives <b>84</b>, as indicated in item step <b>310</b>. Then in item step <b>320</b>, data is transferred from the master disks to the host computer <b>12</b> in the same manner as in item step <b>280</b>.</p>
    <p>After all data from the master disks loaded in stacked recordable disk drives <b>84</b> has been transferred to the host computer <b>12</b>, the master disks are either transferred to the master output spindle <b>55</b>, or are ejected onto the disk reject slide <b>92</b>, as indicated in item step <b>330</b>.</p>
    <p>The computer software completes this loop as indicated in item step <b>340</b> by comparing the number of uncopied master disks with zero, and returning to the top of the loop at item step <b>310</b> if any uncopied master disks remain. Once the data acquisition subprocedure is completed, control of the computer software is transferred to the beginning of the data transfer subprocedure, indicated as item step <b>360</b>.</p>
    <p>At the beginning of the data transfer subprocedure, the computer software will, if necessary, reformat the image of the source data located on the hard drive of the host computer to ensure optimal recording speed and accuracy. This computation is indicated in item step <b>370</b>. A variable containing the number of copies made is initialized to zero, as indicated in item step <b>380</b>.</p>
    <p>Item steps <b>390</b> through <b>430</b> correspond to a loop over all selected stacked recordable disk drives <b>84</b> whereby the computer software first issues commands to the microprocessor <b>24</b> to query the hardware status of each stacked recordable disk drive <b>84</b>, as indicated in item step <b>400</b>. The computer software will alert the user of any stacked recordable disk drive <b>84</b> that the microprocessor <b>24</b> has identified as non-operational, as indicated in step <b>410</b>. Otherwise, the computer software will set a flag indicating that the queried CD-R drive is operational, as indicated in item step <b>420</b>.</p>
    <p>Once the hardware test loop is completed, the computer software branches on a test of the number of operational stacked recordable disk drives <b>84</b>, as indicated in item step <b>440</b>. The computer software will exit the copy process if no stacked recordable disk drives <b>84</b> are operational, as indicated in item step <b>450</b>. Otherwise, the computer software initializes to zero a variable containing the number of copies made, as indicated in item step.<b>460</b>.</p>
    <p>The computer software then enters a main copy loop, indicated in item step <b>470</b>, that repeats until the number of copies made equals the desired number of copies. This comparison operation is made in item step <b>480</b>, and the proper termination of the copy process occurs in item step <b>490</b>.</p>
    <p>If the number of copies made is less than the number of copies desired, the computer software initializes to zero a variable containing the number of copies currently loaded in the stacked recordable disk drives <b>84</b>, as indicated in item step <b>500</b>. The computer software then enters an inner loop comprising item steps <b>510</b> through <b>580</b>, with each cycle of the inner loop corresponding to the transfer of a blank disk to an available operational stacked recordable disk drive <b>84</b>.</p>
    <p>This inner loop begins with a comparison of the number of copies desired with the sum of the copies already made plus the number of disks loaded the current batch transfer, as indicated in item step <b>520</b>. If the sum of the copies already made plus current number of disks loaded into the stacked recordable disk drives <b>84</b> equals the number of copies desired, the inner loop terminates, as indicated in item step <b>530</b>.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, the computer software issues a set of commands to the microprocessor <b>24</b> to transfer a blank disk to the next available stacked recordable disk drive <b>84</b>, as indicated in item step <b>540</b>. The computer software then checks the status of the disk transfer, as indicated in item step <b>550</b>, and will terminate or otherwise commence other error handling subprocedures if the disk transfer failed, as indicated in item step <b>560</b>. Otherwise, the variable containing the number of disks loaded is incremented by one, as indicated in item step <b>570</b>.</p>
    <p>Once the inner loop terminates at item step <b>580</b>, the stacked recordable disk drives <b>84</b> have been loaded with the maximum number of blank disks, the computer software sends electrical signal instructions that activate the physical transfer of source data to each blank disk loaded in the loaded stacked recordable disk drives <b>84</b>, as indicated in item step <b>590</b>. The computer software then examines copy status flags from each loaded stacked recordable disk drive <b>84</b>, as indicated in item step <b>600</b>, and issues a command set to the microprocessor <b>24</b> to discard burned CD-R disks corresponding to any bad copy status flags, as indicated in item step <b>610</b>.</p>
    <p>In item step <b>620</b>, the user can optionally configure the computer software to perform a data verification on each burned disk that is currently loaded in the stacked recordable disk drives <b>84</b>. In this subprocedure, the computer software would direct each stacked recordable disk drive <b>84</b> to read the data off the burned disk and compare it to the source data residing on the hard drive of the host computer <b>12</b>. Defective burned CD-R disks would be ejected from the copy unit in the same manner as in item step <b>610</b>.</p>
    <p>In item step <b>630</b>, the user can optionally configure the copy unit to include a print application unit that imprints or labels the top of each burned CD-R disk with information transferred from the computer software. In this subprocedure, the burned CD-R disk is ejected from its stacked recordable disk drive <b>84</b> and vertically transported by the disk suction pickup unit <b>54</b> and then loaded into the input tray <b>96</b> of the print application unit <b>93</b>.</p>
    <p>The printer has internal software to effect the printing tasks including optional analysis of a preprinted disk and orientation of a virtual print image under command of the software of the copy unit. If optional print step is affirmative the print unit is ordered to extend the print tray <b>96</b> at step <b>632</b>. The copy unit loads a correctly burned disk at step <b>633</b>. If the print image must be oriented to register with a preprinting of the disk at option step <b>634</b>, then the photo image step <b>635</b> takes an image of the disk which is analyzed at step <b>636</b> by the software to locate the orientation mark and calculate the angular orientation of the to-be printed image for proper registration at step <b>637</b>. This accomplished, or if not required, the print disk step <b>638</b> is executed. After printing, the tray is extended at step <b>639</b>, and a delay pickup decision at step <b>641</b> is made. If pickup is to be delayed, for example, to allow ink jet printing ink an extended opportunity to dry, the pickup is delayed at step <b>643</b> is made. If no, or after delay the print option loop returns to the main path at step <b>640</b> where the disk is eventually transferred to the output spindle or spindles.</p>
    <p>The variable containing the number of loaded stacked recordable disk drives is reset to equal the number of properly burned CD-R disks, as indicated in item step <b>640</b>. The total number of copies made is then incremented by the number of properly burned CD-R disks, as indicated in step <b>650</b>. The computer software then issues a command set to the microprocessor <b>24</b> directing the transfer of the properly burned CD-R disks to one of the designated output spindles, as indicated in step <b>660</b>. The computer software receives a status signal from the microprocessor <b>24</b> indicating whether the transfer occurred properly, as indicated in item step <b>670</b>, and will display an error message and exit if a disk transfer failed, as indicated in step <b>680</b>. Otherwise, control of the computer software drops to the bottom of the main loop <b>690</b> and then returns to the top of the main loop at item step <b>470</b>.</p>
    <p>While, in the foregoing, embodiments of the present invention have been set forth in considerable detail for the purposes of making a complete disclosure of the invention, it may be apparent to those of skill in the art that numerous changes may be made in such detail without departing from the spirit and principles of the invention.</p>
