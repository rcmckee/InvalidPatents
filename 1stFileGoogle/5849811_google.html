extended-wear for periods of at least one day on the eye without a clinically significant amount of corneal swelling and without substantial wearer discomfort. The lens has a balance of oxygen permeability and ion or water permeability, with the ion or water permeability being sufficient to provide good on-eye movement, such that a good tear exchange occurs between the lens and the eye. A preferred lens is a copolymerization product of a oxyperm macromer and an ionoperm monomer. The invention encompasses extended wear contact lenses, which include a core having oxygen transmission and ion transmission pathways extending from the inner surface to the outer surface.</div>

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>This invention relates broadly to lenses and polymeric materials useful in optic and ophthalmic arts. More specifically, this invention relates to polymeric materials and treatment processes useful in the manufacture of contact lenses. Still more specifically, this invention relates to contact lenses useful as extended-wear contact lenses.</p>
    <p>2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p>A wide variety of research has been conducted in the field of biocompatible polymers. The definition of the term "biocompatible" depends on the particular application for which the polymer is designed. In the field of ophthalmic lenses, and in particular in the field of contact lenses, a biocompatible lens may be generally defined as one which will not substantially damage the surrounding ocular tissue and ocular fluid during the time period of contact. The phrase "ophthalmically compatible" more appropriately describes the biocompatibility requirements of ophthalmic lenses.</p>
    <p>One ophthalmic compatibility requirement for contact lenses is that the lens must allow oxygen to reach the cornea in an amount which is sufficient for long-term corneal health. The contact lens must allow oxygen from the surrounding air to reach the cornea because the cornea does not receive oxygen from the blood supply like other tissue. If sufficient oxygen does not reach the cornea, corneal swelling occurs. Extended periods of oxygen deprivation causes the undesirable growth of blood vessels in the cornea. "Soft" contact lenses conform closely to the shape of the eye, so oxygen cannot easily circumvent the lens. Thus, soft contact lenses must allow oxygen to diffuse through the lens to reach the cornea.</p>
    <p>Another ophthalmic compatibility requirement for soft contact lenses is that the lens must not strongly adhere to the eye. Clearly, the consumer must be able to easily remove the lens from the eye for disinfecting, cleaning, or disposal. However, the lens must also be able to move on the eye in order to encourage tear flow between the lens and the eye. Tear flow between the lens and eye allows for debris, such as foreign particulates or dead epithelial cells, to be swept from beneath the lens and, ultimately, out of the tear fluid Thus, a contact lens must not adhere to the eye so strongly that adequate movement of the lens on the eye is inhibited.</p>
    <p>While there exist rigid gas permeable ("RGP") contact lenses which have high oxygen permeability and which move on the eye, RGP lenses are typically quite uncomfortable for the consumer. Thus, soft contact lenses are preferred by many consumers because of comfort. Moreover, a contact lens which may be continuously worn for a period of a day or more (including wear during periods of sleeping) requires comfort levels which exclude RGP lenses as popular extended-wear candidates.</p>
    <p>In order to balance the ophthalmic compatibility and consumer comfort requirements in designing a daily wear soft contact lens, polymers and copolymers of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) were developed. These hydrophilic polymers move well on the eye and provide sufficient oxygen permeability for daily wear. Certain soft contact lenses have been approved by the FDA for extended wear periods of up to about 6 nights of overnight wear and seven days of daily wear. However, the consumer cannot safely and comfortably wear these poly(HEMA) lenses for extended periods of seven days or more, because the oxygen permeability is insufficient. True extended wear (i.e., seven days or more) of these lenses may result, at a minimum, in corneal swelling and development of surface blood vessels in the cornea.</p>
    <p>In order to improve oxygen permeability, polymers containing silicone groups were developed. A variety of siloxane-containing polymers have been disclosed as having high oxygen permeability. For example, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,228,741; 3,341,490; 3,996,187; and 3,996,189. However, polysiloxanes are typically highly lipophilic. The properties (e.g., lipophilicity, glass transition temperature, mechanical properties) of known polysiloxanes has resulted in contact lenses which adhere to the eye, inhibiting the necessary lens movement. In addition, polysiloxane lipophilicity promotes adhesion to the lens of lipids and proteins in the tear fluid, causing a haze which interferes with vision through the lens.</p>
    <p>There have been attempts to blend the desirable hydrophilic properties of hydrophilic polymers, formed from monomers such as HEMA, with the desirable oxygen permeability of polymers formed from siloxane-containing monomers. For example, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,808,178; 4,136,250; and 5,070,169. However, prior attempts at producing a true extended wear contact lens have been unsuccessful, either because of the effect of the extended-wear lens on corneal health or because the lens would not move on the eye. Thus, there remains a need for an ophthalmically compatible, transparent polymeric material which is suited to extended periods of continuous contact with ocular tissue and tear fluid.</p>
    <heading>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>An object of the invention is to provide a material having a balance of oxygen permeability, ion permeability, on-eye movement and tear exchange, all of which are sufficient for corneal health and wearer comfort during extended periods of continuous wear.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p>One embodiment of the present invention is an ophthalmically compatible, transparent lens suited to extended periods of continuous contact with ocular tissue and tear fluids. A particularly preferred embodiment of the invention is an extended-wear vision correction lens suited for safe and comfortable long term wear without removal. In order to properly describe the invention and to delineate the metes and bounds of the claims, a set of basic terms will be defined at the outset.</p>
    <p>I. DEFINITION OF TERMS</p>
    <p>An "ophthalmic lens", as used herein, refers to lenses which are placed in intimate contact with the eye or tear fluid, such as contact lenses for vision correction (e.g., spherical, toric, bifocal), contact lenses for modification of eye color, ophthalmic drug delivery devices, ocular tissue protective devices (e.g., ophthalmic healing promoting lenses), and the like. A particularly preferred ophthalmic lens is an extended-wear contact lens, especially extended-wear contact lenses for vision correction.</p>
    <p>A "polymerizable material which is capable of polymerizing to form a polymer having a high oxygen permeability", as used herein, refers to monomers, oligomers, macromers, and the like, and mixtures thereof, which are capable of polymerizing with like or unlike polymerizable materials to form a polymer which displays a relatively high rate of oxygen diffusion therethrough. For convenience of reference, these materials will be referred to herein as "oxyperm polymerizable materials" and the resultant polymers will be referred to herein as "oxyperm polymers".</p>
    <p>The "oxygen transmissibility"of a lens, as used herein, is the rate at which oxygen will pass through a specific ophthalmic lens. Oxygen transmissibility, Dk/t, is conventionally expressed in units of barrers/mm, where t is the average thickness of the material  in units of mm! over the area being measured and "barrer" is defined as:</p>
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"> (cm<sup>3</sup> oxygen)(mm)/(cm<sup>2</sup>)(sec)(mm Hg)!×10<sup>-9</sup> </pre>
    
    <p>The "oxygen permeability", Dk, of a lens material does not depend on lens thickness. Oxygen permeability is the rate at which oxygen will pass through a material. Oxygen permeability is conventionally expressed in units of barrers, where "barrer" is defined as:</p>
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"> (cm<sup>3</sup> oxygen)(mm)/(cm<sup>2</sup>)(sec)(mm Hg)!×10<sup>-10</sup> </pre>
    
    <p>These are the units commonly used in the art. Thus, in order to be consistent with the use in the art, the unit "barrer" will have the meanings as defined above. For example, a lens having a Dk of 90 barrers ("oxygen permeability barrers") and a thickness of 90 microns (0.090 mm) would have a Dk/t of 100 barrers/mm ("oxygen transmissibility barrers"/mm).</p>
    <p>A "polymerizable material which is capable of polymerizing to form a polymer having a high ion permeability", as used herein, refers to monomers, oligomers, macromers, and the like, and mixtures thereof, which are capable of polymerizing with like or unlike polymerizable materials to form a polymer which displays a relatively high rate of ion or water permeation therethrough. For convenience of reference, these materials will be referred to herein as "ionoperm polymerizable materials" and the resultant polymers will be referred to herein as "ionoperm polymers".</p>
    <p>A "macromer", as used herein, refers to a polymerizable material which has a molecular weight of at least about 800 grams/mol. The term "macromer", as used herein, also encompasses oligomers.</p>
    <p>A "monomer", as used herein refers to a polymerizable material which has a molecular weight of less than about 800 grams/mol.</p>
    <p>A "phase", as used herein, refers to a region of substantially uniform composition which is a distinct and physically separate portion of a heterogeneous polymeric material. However, the term "phase"does not imply that the material described is a chemically pure substance, but merely that certain bulk properties differ significantly from the properties of another phase within the material. Thus, with respect to the polymeric components of a lens, an ionoperm phase refers to a region composed of essentially only ionoperm polymer (and water, when hydrated), while an oxyperm phase refers to a region composed of essentially only oxyperm polymer.</p>
    <p>A "continuous phase", as used herein, refers to a region of substantially uniform composition which forms a continuous pathway from one surface of an article to another surface of an article.</p>
    <p>"Co-continuous phases", as used herein, refers to at least two regions, each of substantially uniform composition which differs from the other, and each of which forms a continuous pathway from one surface of an article to another surface of an article. Thus, an ophthalmic lens having co-continuous phases of oxyperm polymer and ionoperm polymer will have two continuous pathways or sets of continuous pathways extending from the inner surface of the lens to the outer surface of the lens.</p>
    <p>"Morphology", as used herein, refers to the structure and relationship of the phases of a material.</p>
    <p>"Ophthalmically compatible", as used herein, refers to a material or surface of a material which may be in intimate contact with the ocular environment for an extended period of time without significantly damaging the ocular environment and without significant user discomfort. Thus, an ophthalmically compatible contact lens will not produce significant corneal swelling, will adequately move on the eye with blinking to promote adequate tear exchange, will not have substantial amounts of lipid adsorption, and will not cause substantial wearer discomfort during the prescribed period of wear.</p>
    <p>"Ocular environment", as used herein, refers to ocular fluids (e.g., tear fluid) and ocular tissue (e.g., the cornea) which may come into intimate contact with a contact lens used for vision correction, drug delivery, wound healing, eye color modification, or other ophthalmic applications.</p>
    <p>"Hydrophilic", as used herein, describes a material or portion thereof which will more readily associate with water than with lipids.</p>
    <p>A "hydrophilic surface ", as used herein, refers to a surface which is more hydrophilic and lipophobic than the bulk or core material of an article. Thus, an ophthalmic lens having a hydrophilic surface describes a lens having a core material having a certain hydrophilicity surrounded, at least in part, by a surface which is more hydrophilic than the core.</p>
    <p>The "outer surface"of a lens, as used herein, refers to the surface of the lens which faces away from the eye during wear. The outer surface, which is typically substantially convex, may also be referred to as the front curve of the lens. The "inner sure" of a lens, as used herein, refers to the surface of the lens which faces towards the eye during wear. The inner surface, which is typically substantially concave, may also be referred to as the base curve of the lens.</p>
    <p>"TRIS", as used herein, refers to 3-methacryloxypropyltris(trimethylsiloxy)silane, which is represented by CAS No. 17096-07-0. The term "TRIS"also includes dimers of 3-methacryloxypropyltris(trimethylsiloxy)silane.</p>
    <p>"Molecular weight" of a polymeric material (including monomeric or macromeric materials), as used herein, refers to the number-average molecular weight unless otherwise specifically noted or unless testing conditions indicate otherwise.</p>
    <p>A. Oxyperm Polymerizable Materials</p>
    <p>Oxyperm polymerizable materials include a wide range of materials which may be polymerized to form a polymer displaying a relatively high oxygen diffusion rate therethrough. In addition, these materials must be relatively ophthalmically compatible. These oxyperm polymerizable materials include, without limitation thereto, siloxane-containing macromers and monomers, fluorine-containing macromers and monomers, and carbon-carbon triple bond-containing macromers and monomers. The oxyperm macromer or monomer may also contain hydrophilic groups.</p>
    <p>Preferred oxyperm polymers are those formed from a siloxane-containing macromer. Macromers having dialkyl siloxane groups, especially dimethyl siloxanes, are particularly preferred. These macromers are broadly referred to as poly(dimethyl siloxanes) (also, PDMS). The siloxane-containing macromer may also include hydrophilic groups. Examples of suitable siloxane-containing macromers include, without limitation thereto, the Materials A, B, C, and D as described herein.</p>
    <p>The oxygen transmissibility (Dk/t) of the lens is preferably at least 70 barrers/mm, more preferably at least 75 barrers/mm, and most preferably at least 87 barrers/mm. The lens center thickness is typically more than about 30 microns, preferably about 30 to about 200 microns, more preferably about 40 to about 150 microns, even more preferably about 50 to about 120 microns, and most preferably about 60 to about 100 microns.</p>
    <p>The oxygen transmissibility of the extended-wear lens from the outer surface to the inner surface must be sufficient to prevent any substantial corneal swelling during the period of extended wear. It is known that the cornea swells approximately 3% to 4% during overnight periods of sleep when the eyelids are closed, as a result of oxygen deprivation. It is also known that wearing a typical contact lens, such as ACUVUE (Johnson &amp; Johnson), for a period of about 8 hours (overnight wear) causes corneal swelling of about 11%. However, a preferred extended-wear contact lens will produce, after wear of about 24 hours, including normal sleep periods, corneal swelling of less than about 8%, more preferably less than about 6%, and most preferably less than about 4%. A preferred extended-wear contact lens will produce, after wear of about 7 days, including normal sleep periods, corneal swelling of less than about 10%, more preferably less than about 7%, and most preferably less than about 5%. Thus, the extended-wear lens must have oxyperm polymer in an amount sufficient to produce oxygen diffusion pathways from the outer surface to the inner surface of the lens which are sufficient to yield the above properties relating to corneal swelling. Preferably, the extended-wear lens has a continuous phase of oxyperm polymer extending from the outer surface to the inner surface of the lens.</p>
    <p>B. Ionoperm Polymerizable Materials</p>
    <p>Ionoperm polymerizable materials include a wide range of materials which may be polymerized to form a polymer displaying a relatively high ion diffusion rate therethrough. In addition, these materials must be relatively ophthalmically compatible. These ionoperm polymerizable materials include, without limitation thereto, acrylates and methacrylates, such as 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, acrylamide, methacrylamide, and dimethylacrylamide; poly(alkylene glycols), such as poly(ethylene glycol); N-vinyl pyrrolidones such as N-vinyl-2pyrrolidone; and the like and mixtures thereof. Other ionoperm materials are disclosed in the specific embodiments of Materials A-D, described below.</p>
    <p>C. Weight Ratios</p>
    <p>The ratios of oxyperm to ionoperm polymerizable materials may vary substantially, depending on the selected balance of oxygen permeability and ion permeability for the chosen end-use of the molded polymeric article. Preferably, the volumetric ratio of oxyperm to ionoperm material (including water) in the fully hydrated lens is about 40 to about 60 to about 60 to about 40. However, weight percentages, based on the total weight of the lens, will be defined because weight percentages are more conveniently utilized in lens fabrication. Preferably, the extended-wear contact lenses having substantially only ionoperm and oxyperm materials will have about 60 to about 85 weight percent oxyperm polymerizable material and about 15 to about 40 weight percent ionoperm polymerizable material in the prepolymerization mixture, based on total polymerizable material weight. More preferably, the prepolymerization mixture will contain about 70 to about 82 weight percent oxyperm polymerizable material and about 18 to about 30 weight percent ionoperm polymerizable material, based on total polymerizable material weight.</p>
    <p>A wide variety of additional polymerizable materials may be included in the mixture prior to polymerization. Cross-linking agents, such as ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), may be added to improve structural integrity and mechanical strength. Antimicrobial polymerizable materials such as poly(quaternary ammonium) salts may be added to inhibit microbial growth on the lens material. Also, additional ionoperm monomers or macromers and oxyperm polymerizable materials may be added to adjust the oxygen permeability and ion permeability of the final molded article. An especially advantageous polymerizable material is TRIS, which may act both to increase oxygen permeability and to improve the modulus of elasticity.</p>
    <p>A preferred prepolymerization mixture will include (a) about 30 to 60 weight percent oxyperm macromer, (b) about 20 to 40 weight percent ionoperm polymerizable material, and (c) about 1 to 35 weight percent TRIS, based on the total lens weight. More preferably, the amount of TRIS is about 10 to 33 weight percent, based on the total prepolymerization mixture weight.</p>
    <p>In a preferred embodiment, the prepolymerization mixture includes less than about 5 weight percent cross-linking agent based on the total prepolymerization mixture weight. More preferably, the prepolymerization mixture includes less than about 2 weight percent cross-linking agent, based on the total prepolymerization mixture weight. Even more preferably, the prepolymerization mixture includes substantially no cross-linking agent. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the prepolymerization mixture includes no added cross-linking agent.</p>
    <p>The previously described ranges for oxyperm polymerizable materials, ionoperm polymerizable materials, and TRIS are offered to enable the reader to better comprehend the invention. However, it should be noted that the specific weight or volume percentages of oxyperm and ionoperm polymerizable materials are not the most critical factors to consider in preparing a good extended-wear ophthalmic lens. More importantly, the lens must have sufficient ion permeability for good on-eye movement and sufficient oxygen permeability for good corneal health during the extended wear period.</p>
    <p>D. Morphology</p>
    <p>One requirement of the lens material is that the lens allow a high visible light transmission from the outer to inner surface of the lens. A lens morphology which includes large phase separated regions will reduce visible light transmission and cause substantial undesirable image distortion, thereby destroying the value of the lens as a vision correction device. Thus, the lens must have a morphology which allows at least about 80%, more preferably about 90%, visible light transmission and does not produce any significant undesirable image distortion.</p>
    <p>In one preferred embodiment, the lens material has at least two phases: the phases including at least one oxyperm phase and at least one ionoperm phase. While there may be two distinct phases, it is believed that there may be a transition phase, or interphase, in which the material composition and the material properties are a blend of those of the oxyperm and ionoperm materials. Thus, there may exist a distinct oxyperm phase or plurality of distinct oxyperm phases, a distinct ionoperm phase or a plurality of distinct ionoperm phases, and an amphipathic phase mixture or blend of oxyperm and ionoperm phases. In one preferred embodiment, the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the oxyperm phase is less than about -115° Celsius.</p>
    <p>The existence of separate oxyperm and ionoperm phases, rather than a complete blend of oxyperm and ionoperm phases, is believed to be advantageous in promoting the diffusion of oxygen and ions. Oxygen will diffuse predominantly through the oxyperm polymer, while the ionoperm polymer provides a higher barrier to oxygen diffusion. Similarly, ions will diffuse well through the ionoperm polymer, but the oxyperm polymer provides a higher resistance to ion diffusion. Thus, one homogeneous oxyperm/ionoperm phase will provide undesirable resistance to both oxygen and ion diffusion, while two separate oxyperm and ionoperm phases will provide low resistance pathways for transmission of both oxygen and ions or water. Thus, the ideal extended-wear lens has a pathway or series of pathways from the outer surface to the inner surface for transmission of oxygen therethrough, and an analogous continuous pathway or series of pathways for transmission of water or ions therethrough. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the lens has two co-continuous phases, one an oxyperm phase and the other an ionoperm phase, allowing for permeation of water or ions and oxygen between the front and base curves of the lens.</p>
    <p>E. Bulk Water Content</p>
    <p>The measurement of water content is difficult because the removal of adhered surface droplets, without affecting the bulk lens water content, is difficult. In addition, water may evaporate from the lens surface quickly, thereby lowering the water content from the equilibrium level. Accordingly, a discussion of the bulk water content of a lens warrants a discussion of the measurement technique used to determine the water content.</p>
    <p>The preferred bulk water content of the hydrated lens will be a function of the lens material properties. The material properties are dependent on the prepolymerization macromers and monomers and polymerization conditions. Thus, the preferred water content for a lens including a fluorine-containing oxyperm material may be different from that of a lens including a siloxane-containing oxyperm material. Accordingly, while general ranges for bulk water content are offered for a better understanding of the invention, the invention is not generally limited to specific bulk water contents.</p>
    <p>One method of measuring the water content of a lens formed in accordance with the present invention, referred to herein as the "Bulk Technique", is as follows. First the lens is thoroughly hydrated in a physiological saline solution, such that the water in the lens is in equilibrium with the surrounding water. Next the lens is gently blotted between two lint-free blotting cloths to remove surface moisture. The lens is quickly placed on an aluminum weighing pan and the first wet weight, W<sub>1</sub>, is measured. Next, the aluminum pan with lens is placed in a oven at 36° C. for a period of at least 24 hours. After heat treating, the pan with lens is removed, placed in a desiccator, and allowed to cool to room temperature (about 22° C.). The pan with lens is weighed again to determine the dry weight, W<sub>d</sub>. The lens is re-equilibrated in physiological saline solution and a second wet weight W<sub>2</sub> is determined thereon. The wet weights (W<sub>1</sub> and W<sub>2</sub>) are averaged to yield an average wet weight, W<sub>W</sub>. The bulk water content is determined by the following equation:</p>
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation">Percent water content=(W<sub>w</sub> -W<sub>d</sub>)/W<sub>w</sub> ×100</pre>
    
    <p>A preferred lens bulk water content, determined by the "Bulk Technique", is less than about 32 weight percent. More preferably, the lens has a water content of about 10 to 30 weight percent, based on the total lens weight. A particularly preferred lens water content is about 15 to about 25 weight percent.</p>
    <p>F. Ion and Water Permeability</p>
    <p>Unexpectedly, it has been determined that the ion permeability through the lens correlates well with on-eye movement. As discussed earlier, it is known that on-eye movement of the lens is required to ensure good tear exchange, and ultimately, to ensure good cornea health. While the invention is not bound by theory presented herein, it may be useful to discuss some theory for a better understanding of ways to practice the invention.</p>
    <p>It is theorized that water permeability is an exceptionally important feature for an extended-wear lens which includes oxyperm polymers such as those disclosed herein. Siloxane-containing oxyperm materials tend to adhere strongly to the eye, thereby stopping on-eye movement. The ability to pass water through the lens is believed to allow a siloxane-containing polymeric lens to move on the eye, where the movement occurs via forces exerted by water being squeezed out of the lens. The water permeability of the lens is also believed important in replenishing lens water content once pressure is removed. Further, the permeability of ions is believed to be directly proportional to the permeability of water. Thus, ion permeability is a predictor of on-eye movement.</p>
    <p>However, regardless of whether the water permeability theory is a correct understanding of the actual on-eye movement phenomenon, it has been unexpectedly found that above a certain threshhold of ion permeability through a lens, from the inner surface of the lens to the outer, or vice versa, the lens will move on the eye, and below the threshhold the lens will adhere to the eye. Thus, the present innovative extended-wear contact lenses provide a balance between the relatively high oxygen permeability (and associated high binding capacity) of oxyperm materials with the low binding capacity (high on-eye movement) of ionoperm materials. It is believed that this is accomplished by providing a plurality of continuous ion transmission pathways for ion and water movement through the lens.</p>
    <p>It should be noted that ions may move through the lens via these ion pathways by a number of means. For example, ions may diffuse through the lens because of concentration differences from one surface to another. Ions may also be forced through the ion pathways by the mechanical action of blinking, with the concomittent compression forces on the lens essentially squeezing water out of the lens. In addition, the charge nature of the surfaces may provide an electromotive force which drives ion permeation through the lens. At times, one of these driving forces may be larger than the others, while at other times the relative magnitude may reverse. This discussion is presented to clarify that the invention is not restricted by the method or driving force by which ions move through the lens.</p>
    <p>Neither the measurement of water permeability nor ion permeability through an ophthalmic lens is considered a routine matter of testing in the industry. Accordingly, a discussion of the preferred ion or water permeability ranges warrants a discussion of the measurement techniques used to determine the permeability.</p>
    <p>The water permeability of a lens may be determined from the rate of water permeation through the lens, from one surface to another surface. The water permeability of a lens may be determined by positioning a lens between two reservoirs holding solutions having known, and different, initial concentrations of radiolabeled water (e.g., tritiated water), and then measuring concentration of radiolabeled water in the "receiving" reservoir (the reservoir towards which the net flow of radiolabeled water is positive) as a function of time.</p>
    <p>The relative ion permeability of a lens may be determined from the rate of ion permeation through the lens, from one surface to another surface. The rate of ion permeation may be determined by positioning a lens between two reservoirs holding solutions having known, and different, initial ion concentrations, and then measuring conductivity in the "receiving" reservoir (the reservoir towards which the net flow of ions is positive) as a function of time. The concentration of ions, such as sodium, can be measured accurately using a pH meter and an ion-selective electrode. Ions are believed to be transmitted through a lens, from inner to outer surfaces and vice versa, primarily by the diffusion of ions through water pathways in the lens. Ion permeability through a lens is believed to be directly proportional to water permeability through a lens.</p>
    <p>1. Ionoflux Measurement Technique</p>
    <p>The following technique, referred to herein as the "Ionoflux Technique", is a preferred method for determining the ion permeability of a lens. This technique may be used to determine the likelihood of adequate on-eye movement.</p>
    <p>The "Ionoflux Technique" involves the use of a conductometer (LF 2000/C, catalog no. 300105, Wissenschaftlich-Technische Werkstatten GmbH (WTW), Germany), an electrode equipped with a temperature sensor (LR 01/T, catalog no. 302 520, WTW), a donor chamber containing a salt solution, a receiving chamber containing about 60 ml of deionized water, a stir bar and a thermostat.</p>
    <p>The donor chamber is specially designed for sealing a contact lens thereto, so that the donor solution does not pass around the lens (i.e., ions may only pass through the lens). The donor chamber is composed of a glass tube which is threaded at the end which is immersed in the receiving solution. The glass tube includes a centrally located hole of about 9 mm in diameter. A lid, which is threaded to mate with the glass tube, holds a lens-retaining member which includes a centrally located hole of about 8 mm in diameter. The lens-retaining member includes a male portion adapted to mate with and seal the edges of the inner (concave) surface of a lens and a female portion adapted to mate with and seal the edges of the outer (convex) surface of a lens.</p>
    <p>The lens to be measured is placed in the lens-retaining member, between the male and female portions. The male and female portions include flexible sealing rings which are positioned between the lens and the respective male or female portion. After positioning the lens in the lens-retaining member, the lens-retaining member is placed in the threaded lid. The lid is screwed onto the glass tube to define the donor chamber. The donor chamber is filled with 16 ml of 0.1 molar NaCl solution. The receiving chamber is filled with 60 ml of deionized water. The leads of the conductivity meter are immersed in the deionized water of the receiving chamber and a stir bar is added to the receiving chamber. The receiving chamber is placed in a thermostat and the temperature is held at about 35° C. Finally, the donor chamber is immersed in the receiving chamber.</p>
    <p>Measurements of conductivity are taken every 20 minutes for about three hours, starting 10 minutes after immersion of the donor chamber into the receiving chamber. The Ionoflux Diffusion Coefficient, D, is determined by applying Fick's law as follows:</p>
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation">D=-n'/(A×dc/dx)</pre>
    
    <p>where</p>
    <p>n'=rate of ion transport (mol/min)</p>
    <p>A=area of lens exposed (mm<sup>2</sup>)</p>
    <p>D=Ionoflux Diffusion Coefficient (mm<sup>2</sup> /min)</p>
    <p>dc=concentration difference (mol/L)</p>
    <p>dx=thickness of lens (mm)</p>
    <p>An Ionoflux Diffusion Coefficient of greater than about 6.4×10<sup>-6</sup> mm<sup>2</sup> /min is preferred for achieving sufficient on-eye movement. More preferably, the Ionoflux Diffusion Coefficient is greater than about 2.6×10<sup>-6</sup> mm<sup>2</sup> /min, while most preferably, the Ionoflux Diffusion Coefficient is greater than about 1.5×10<sup>-6</sup> mm<sup>2</sup> /min. It must be emphasized that the Ionoflux Diffusion Coefficient correlates with ion permeability through the lens, and thereby is a predictor of on-eye movement.</p>
    <p>2. Ionoton Measurement Technique</p>
    <p>The following technique, referred to herein as the "Ionoton Technique", is another preferred method for determining the relative ion permeability of a lens. The technique is based on measurement of the diffusion of sodium chloride through a lens.</p>
    <p>The "Ionoton Technique" involves the use of a pH meter (Beckman, VWR catalog no. BK123142), a VSC-1 Diffusion Cell Drive Console (Crown-Bio, Somerville, N.J.), a DCB-100B Diffusion Cell (Crown-Bio), and a 6 cm sodium ion-specific electrode (Microelectronics, Londonderry, N.H., catalog no. MI414P). The technique is not limited to the aforementioned instruments or materials; equivalent instruments or materials may be used.</p>
    <p>First, a contact lens is mounted onto an orifice of the DCB-100B cell chamber, the donor chamber. Next, the connecting cell chamber (receptor chamber) is placed against the cell chamber containing the contact lens and tightly clamped on the clamp holder supplied with the VSC-1 Drive Console. Then, a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Mediatech catalog no. 21-031-LV) is placed into the receptor side of the cell chamber. Stir bars are added to each cell chamber. The 6 cm electrode is placed into the PBS saline receptor side. After the electrode has equilibrated in the PBS saline, the pH meter is placed in the mV function to establish the 0 mV point. PBS which has been saturated with sodium chloride is added to the donor chamber.</p>
    <p>The millivolt signal is recorded at 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minute intervals. The millivolt signal is converted to a sodium ion concentration by a standard curve of sodium ion concentration vs. millivolt signal. The Ionoton Ion Permeability Coefficient, P, is then determined in accordance with the following equation:</p>
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation">ln (1-2C(t)/C(0))=-2APt/Vd</pre>
    
    <p>where:</p>
    <p>C(t)=concentration of sodium ions at time t in the receiving cell</p>
    <p>C(0)=initial concentration of sodium ions in donor cell</p>
    <p>A=membrane areas i.e., lens area exposed to cells</p>
    <p>V=volume of cell compartment (3.0 ml)</p>
    <p>d=average lens thickness in the area exposed</p>
    <p>P=permeability coefficient</p>
    <p>The average thickness of the lens in the exposed test area may be determined by averaging a number of readings, e.g., 10 readings, with a low-pressure thickness-measuring instrument, such as a Mitotoya micrometer VL-50, or equivalents thereof. The Ionoton Ion Permeability Coefficient, P, having units of cm<sup>2</sup> /second, may be determined from the slope of a plot of time (t) v. In(1-2 C(t)/C(0))×(-2At/Vd).</p>
    <p>An Ionoton Ion Permeability Coefficient, P, of greater than about 0.2×10<sup>-6</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> /sec is preferred, while greater than about 0.3×10<sup>-6</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> /sec is more preferred and greater than about 0.4×10<sup>-6</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> /sec is most preferred. It must be emphasized that the Ionoton Ion Permeability Coefficient correlates with ion permeability through the lens, and thereby is a predictor of on-eye movement.</p>
    <p>3. Hydrodell Water Permeability Technique</p>
    <p>The following technique, referred to herein as the "Hydrodell Technique", is a preferred method for determining the water permeability of a lens. This technique may be used to determine the likelihood of adequate on-eye movement.</p>
    <p>The Hydrodell Technique involves the measurement of the rate of transfer of the radiolabeled solutes THO (<sup>3</sup> H--HO or tritiated water) and <sup>14</sup> C-glucose across the contact lens using a two-chamber apparatus. <sup>14</sup> C-glucose is used in this measurement technique to reveal any leak in the system during testing. The lens is mounted between chambers, which are stirred at a controllable rate. Chamber I contains a solution with a high concentration of labeled solute. Chamber II, the "receiving chamber", contains an identical solution but without the labeled solute. Samples of the solution in chambers I and II are taken at intervals over the test period. The radioactivity in the samples is measured. The permeability of the lens is calculated from the measured radioactivity, the sample times, the chamber volumes and the lens area exposed to the solutions. A more detailed description of the Hydrodell Technique follows.</p>
    <heading>a. Solution Preparation</heading> <p>Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) is prepared by first dissolving, sequentially, about 160 g sodium chloride (NaCl), about 4 grams potassium chloride (KCl), about 23 grams disodium hydrogen orthophosphate (Na<sub>2</sub> HPO<sub>4</sub>), about 4 grams potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate (KH<sub>2</sub> PO<sub>4</sub>), and about 10 grams sodium azide in a liter of reverse-osmosis (MilliQ) water. Then, the pH is adjusted to about 7.3 by adding appropriate amounts of HCl. Finally, the buffer solution is diluted to 1:20 (50 ml buffer solution with 950 ml reverse-osmosis water), and allowed to degas either in a screw capped container overnight or under vacuum.</p>
    <p>A Cold Glucose buffer solution is prepared by adding about 0.1 grams D-glucose to one liter of DPBS, followed by sterilization via filtration through a 0.2 μl millipore filter and storage at 4° C. until use.</p>
    <p>The Chamber I solution is prepared by adding about 6 μl THO (TR53, 1.0 mCi/ml activity, available from Amersham Australia, located in North Ryde NSW Australia) and about 16 μ<sup>14</sup> C-glucose (in ethanol, available from Amersham Australia) to about 12 ml of the Cold Glucose buffer solution. Preferably, this solution is used within about 24 hours of preparation. The Chamber II solution is DPBS.</p>
    <heading>b. Apparatus Preparation</heading> <p>The chambers have a volume sufficient to hold about 12 ml of solution during testing. While the exact shape of the chambers is not critical, both chambers have rectangular cross-sections for ease of construction. The chambers may be made from a variety of water-proof rigid materials, preferably clear (e.g., acrylic plates, FX Plastics, Marrickville NSW Australia) so that samples may be observed during testing. Each chamber has a circular aperture of about 7 mm diameter appropriate for mounting a lens between the chambers for contact with solutions held within the chambers. Some affixing means, such as a set of mounting bolts, are necessary to securely affix one chamber to the other with the lens mounted in between.</p>
    <p>A test contact lens is mounted symmetrically over the aperture of Chamber II. Folds and wrinkles are manually removed from the lens. Chamber I is positioned adjacent the aperture and mounted lens of Chamber II, and the chambers are secured to one another using mounting bolts.</p>
    <p>About 12 ml (V2) of DPBS is placed in Chamber II. About 12 ml of the Chamber I labeled solution is placed in Chamber I, at which point time t=0 is established. Stirrers are added to both chambers and the stirrer speed is set at about 1200 rpm.</p>
    <heading>c. Sampling</heading> <p>Sampling generally starts at time t<sub>0</sub> =5 minutes. The final sample time, t<sub>f</sub>, is usually at about 50 minutes for high water content lenses and about 120 minutes for low water content lenses, although these times are not critical.</p>
    <p>At time t<sub>0</sub> =5 minutes, two samples of about 0.2 ml volume are pipetted from Chamber I, and two 0.2 ml aliquots of DPBS are added to Chamber I to restore the volume. These samples are placed into plastic counting tubes with about 4 ml Ultima Gold™ cocktail (available from Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, Conn.) and about 0.9 ml DPBS.</p>
    <p>Also at time t<sub>0</sub>, one sample of about 1.0 ml volume is pipetted from Chamber II and one 1.0 ml aliquot of DPBS is added to Chamber II to restore the volume. The sample is placed into a plastic counting tube with about 4 ml Ultima Gold™ cocktail.</p>
    <p>At intermediate times between t<sub>0</sub> and t<sub>f</sub> (e.g., every 10 minutes), one sample of about 1.0 ml volume is pipetted from Chamber II and one 1.0 ml aliquot of DPBS is added to Chamber II to restore the volume. Each sample is placed into a plastic counting tube with about 4 ml Ultima Gold™ cocktail.</p>
    <p>At time t<sub>f</sub>, two samples of about 0.2 ml volume are pipetted from Chamber I. These samples are placed into plastic counting tubes with about 4 ml Ultima Gold™ cocktail and about 0.9 ml DPBS.</p>
    <p>Also at time t<sub>f</sub>, two samples of about 1.0 ml volume are pipetted from Chamber II. These samples are placed into plastic counting tubes with about 4 ml Ultima Golds™ cocktail.</p>
    <heading>d. Measurements</heading> <p>The activity of the samples are measured by liquid scintillation counting, or other appropriate technique. Liquid scintillation counting may be advantageously accomplished by using protocol number 6 for <sup>3</sup> H/<sup>14</sup> C on a Tri-Carb Liquid Scintillation Analyzer (1900TR, available from Packard Instrument Co.).</p>
    <p>Three standards containing about 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> cpm THO in reversed-osmosis (MilliQ) water are prepared. Three standards containing about 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> cpm <sup>14</sup> C glucose in reversed-osmosis (MilliQ) water are also prepared. A blank containing MilliQ water is prepared.</p>
    <p>The scintillation analyzer settings are LLA=0 KeV and ULA=12 KeV for <sup>3</sup> H ("1") in channel 1 and LLB=12 KeV and ULB=156 KeV for <sup>14</sup> C ("2") in channel 2. The standards and blank are counted three times during each counting of samples, and the counts are averaged. The following denote the relevant measured sample activities:</p>
    <p>b<sub>1</sub> =measured activity of blank sample in channel 1</p>
    <p>b<sub>2</sub> =measured activity of blank sample in channel 2</p>
    <p>S'<sub>11</sub> =measured activity of standard <sup>3</sup> H sample in channel 1</p>
    <p>S'<sub>12</sub> =measured activity of standard <sup>14</sup> C sample in channel 2</p>
    <p>S'<sub>21</sub> =measured activity of standard <sup>3</sup> H sample in channel 1</p>
    <p>S'<sub>22</sub> =measured activity of standard <sup>14</sup> C sample in channel 2</p>
    <p>y<sub>1</sub> =measured activity of test sample (both <sup>3</sup> H and <sup>14</sup> C) in channel 1</p>
    <p>y<sub>2</sub> =measured activity of test sample (both <sup>3</sup> H and <sup>14</sup> C) in channel 2</p>
    <heading>e. Water Permeability Calculation</heading> <p>In order to calculate the actual activity of a sample, the measured activities of the isotopes, <sup>3</sup> H and <sup>14</sup> C, must first be corrected to remove the cross-contamination error due to the presence of both isotopes in one sample. Without explaining the mathematical derivations, the following stepwise procedure is offered as an example of one method of determining water permeability from the above measurements:</p>
    <p>(1) Calculate S<sub>11</sub>, S<sub>12</sub>, S<sub>21</sub>, and S<sub>22</sub>, from the following equations:</p>
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation">S<sub>11</sub> =S'<sub>11</sub> -b<sub>1</sub> </pre>
    
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation">S<sub>12</sub> =S'<sub>12</sub> -b<sub>1</sub> </pre>
    
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation">S<sub>21</sub> =S'<sub>21</sub> -b<sub>2</sub> </pre>
    
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation">S<sub>22</sub> =S'<sub>22</sub> -b<sub>2</sub> </pre>
    
    <p>(2) Calculate a<sub>12</sub> and a<sub>21</sub> from the following equations:</p>
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation">a<sub>12</sub> =S<sub>12</sub> /S<sub>22</sub> </pre>
    
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation">a<sub>21</sub> =S<sub>21</sub> /S<sub>11</sub> </pre>
    
    <p>(3) Calculate corrected concentrations of <sup>3</sup> H ("1") and <sup>14</sup> C ("2") from the following equations:</p>
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation">c<sub>1</sub> = (y<sub>1</sub> -b<sub>1</sub>)-a<sub>12</sub> (y<sub>2</sub> -b<sub>2</sub>)!/(1-a<sub>12</sub> a<sub>21</sub>)V</pre>
    
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation">c<sub>2</sub> = (y<sub>2</sub> -b<sub>2</sub>)-a<sub>21</sub> (y<sub>1</sub> -b<sub>1</sub>)!/(1-a<sub>12</sub> a<sub>21</sub>)V</pre>
    
    <p>where V is the volume of the test sample.</p>
    <p>(4) Calculate water permeability for an interval from t<sub>1</sub> to t<sub>2</sub> as follows:</p>
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation">P=V<sub>II</sub>  c<sub>II</sub> (t<sub>2</sub>)-c<sub>II</sub> (t<sub>1</sub>)!/A(c<sub>I</sub> -c<sub>II</sub>)(t<sub>1</sub> -t<sub>2</sub>)</pre>
    
    <p>where V<sub>II</sub> is the volume of Chamber II, c<sub>II</sub> (t<sub>2</sub>) is the concentration of <sup>3</sup> H in Chamber II at time t<sub>2</sub>, c<sub>II</sub> (t<sub>1</sub>) is the concentration of <sup>3</sup> H in Chamber II at time t<sub>1</sub>, A is the area of lens exposure, c<sub>I</sub> is the average concentration of <sup>3</sup> H in Chamber I over the time period t<sub>1</sub> to t<sub>2</sub> and c<sub>II</sub> is the average concentration of <sup>3</sup> H in Chamber II over the time period t<sub>1</sub> to t<sub>2</sub>.</p>
    <p>The ophthalmic lenses of one embodiment of the present invention have a Hydrodell Water Permeability Coefficient of greater than about 0.2×10<sup>-6</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> /sec. The ophthalmic lenses in a preferred embodiment of the invention have Hydrodell Water Permeability Coefficient of greater than about 0.3×10<sup>-6</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> /sec. The ophthalmic lenses in a preferred embodiment of the invention have Hydrodell Water Permeability Coefficient of greater than about 0.4×10<sup>-6</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> /sec.</p>
    <p>G. Oxygen Transmissibility and Permeability</p>
    <p>As mentioned earlier, the cornea receives oxygen primarily from the cornea surface which is exposed to the environment, in contrast to other tissues which receives oxygen from blood flow. Thus, an ophthalmic lens which may be worn on the eye for extended periods of time must allow sufficient oxygen to permeate through the lens to the cornea to sustain corneal health. One result of the cornea receiving an inadequate amount of oxygen is that the cornea will swell. In a preferred embodiment, the oxygen transmissibility of the present ophthalmic lenses is sufficient to prevent any clinically significant amount of corneal swelling from occurring.</p>
    <p>A preferred ophthalmic lens material will have an oxygen transmissibility, Dk/t, of at least 70 (cm<sup>3</sup> oxygen)(mm)/mm-cm<sup>2</sup> ×(sec/mm Hg)×10<sup>-9</sup> or (barrers/mm), more preferably at least 75 barrers/mm, and most preferably at least 87 barrers/mm.</p>
    <p>The oxygen permeability of a lens and oxygen transmissibility of a lens material may be determined by the following technique. Oxygen fluxes (J) are measured at 34 C in a wet cell (i.e., gas streams are maintained at about 100% relative humidity) using a Dk1000 instrument (available from Applied Design and Development Co., Norcross, Ga.), or similar analytical instrument. An air stream, having a known percentage of oxygen (e.g., 21%), is passed across one side of the lens at a rate of about 10 to 20 cm<sup>3</sup> /min., while a nitrogen stream is passed on the opposite side of the lens at a rate of about 10 to 20 cm<sup>3</sup> /min. The barometric pressure surrounding the system, P<sub>measured</sub>, is measured. The thickness (t) of the lens in the area being exposed for testing is determined by measuring about 10 locations with a Mitotoya micrometer VL-50, or similar instrument, and averaging the measurements. The oxygen concentration in the nitrogen stream (i.e., oxygen which diffuses through the lens) is measured using the DK1000 instrument. The oxygen permeability of the lens material, D<sub>k</sub>, is determined from the following formula:</p>
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation">D<sub>k</sub> =Jt/(P<sub>oxygen</sub>)</pre>
    
    <p>where</p>
    <p>J=oxygen flux (microliters O<sub>2</sub> /cm<sup>2</sup> -minute)</p>
    <p>P<sub>oxygen</sub> =(P<sub>measured</sub> -P<sub>water</sub> vapor)×(% O<sub>2</sub> in air stream) (mm Hg)=partial pressure of oxygen in the air stream</p>
    <p>P<sub>measured</sub> =barometric pressure (mm Hg)</p>
    <p>P<sub>water</sub> vapor =0 mm Hg at 34 C (in a dry cell) (mm Hg)</p>
    <p>P<sub>water</sub> vapor =40 mm Hg at 34 C (in a wet cell) (mm Hg)</p>
    <p>t=average thickness of the lens over the exposed test area (mm)</p>
    <p>where D<sub>k</sub> is expressed in units of barrers, i.e., ((cc oxygen)(mm)/cm<sup>2</sup>)×(sec/mm Hg)×10<sup>-10</sup>.</p>
    <p>The oxygen transmissibility (D<sub>k</sub> /t) of the material may be calculated by dividing the oxygen permeability (D<sub>k</sub>) by the average thickness (t) of the lens.</p>
    <p>H. Mechanical On-eye Movement Parameters</p>
    <p>On-eye movement of a lens may be predicted from the mechanical properties of a lens, the ion or water permeability through the lens, or both the mechanical properties and ion or water permeability. In fact, on-eye movement may be predicted more accurately from a combination of mechanical properties and ion or water permeability.</p>
    <heading>1. Tensile Modulus and Short Relaxation Time</heading> <p>Tensile mechanical testing may be performed on lens materials to determine mechanical properties. A procedure for preparing a test sample from a lens for subsequent mechanical testing includes the following steps:</p>
    <p>1. Cut a parallel-sided strip through the center of the lens. A suitable width for the strip is about 3.1 mm.</p>
    <p>2. Immerse the test strip in a phosphate-buffered saline solution (approximating ocular fluid osmolality) for a period of about 24 hours before testing.</p>
    <p>3. Conduct mechanical testing with the test strip immersed in phosphate-buffered saline at ambient temperature (about 23° C.).</p>
    <p>Tensile modulus may be measured by applying a stain rate of about 100% per minute to the test strip and recording the resultant stress. However, the procedure may be used at differing strain rates.</p>
    <p>Stress relaxation is measured by applying a constant strain of about 5% to the test strip and recording the resultant stress for about 5 minutes. A useful mechanical testing instrument for this type of testing is the Vitrodyne V-200 from Liveco Biomechanical Instruments, located in Burlington, Vt.</p>
    <p>In order to analyze stress relaxation data, a three element Maxwell-Wiechert model (a spring and two spring-dashpot elements in parallel) may be assumed for the polymer material. For this model the stress relaxation modulus is given by the following equation:</p>
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation">E(t)=E<sub>0</sub> +E<sub>1</sub> exp (-t/t<sub>1</sub>)+E<sub>2</sub> exp (-t/t<sub>2</sub>)</pre>
    
    <p>Stress v. time curves may be normalized to the maximum (initial) stress induced in the samples. These curves may be analyzed by a variety of commercially available software (for example, ORIGIN software) by fitting the double exponential equation:</p>
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation">y(t)=y<sub>0</sub> +A<sub>1</sub> exp (-t/t<sub>1</sub>)+A<sub>2</sub> exp (-t/t<sub>2</sub>)</pre>
    
    <p>in order to obtain the stress relaxation parameters y<sub>0</sub>, t<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>, and A<sub>2</sub>.</p>
    <p>It has been determined that the tensile modulus (modulus of elasticity, E) and the short relaxation time constant (t<sub>1</sub>) correlate well with on-eye movement. In order to have appropriate on-eye movement, a lens preferably has a tensile modulus of less than about 3 MPa More preferably, E is about 0.4 to about 2.5 MPa while a particularly preferred E is about 0.5 to about 1.5 MPa.</p>
    <p>A preferred short relaxation time constant (t<sub>1</sub>) is greater than about 3.5 seconds. More preferably, t<sub>1</sub> is greater than about 4 seconds, while a particularly preferred t<sub>1</sub> is greater than about 4.5 seconds.</p>
    <heading>2. Tangent Delta</heading> <p>Lenses may also be evaluated by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) methods. It has been determined that a factor known as tan δ (i.e., tangent delta), also known as mechanical loss factor, correlates well with on-eye movement. It has been observed that lens materials which move on the eye exhibit a distinct increase in tan δ with increasing frequency from about 0.1 to 10 Hz when these materials are tested by dynamic mechanical analysis. The tan δ of a preferred lens material is above about 0.2 at 0.1 Hz and increases to about 0.25 or more at about 10 Hz. A tan δ of about 0.3 or greater at 10 Hz is more preferred, while a tan δ of about 0.5 or greater at 10 Hz is even more preferred.</p>
    <p>DMA measurements may be determined in accordance with the following procedure. A disk of lens material having a diameter of about 3.0 mm and a thickness of about 0.50 mm is formed. The disk is placed in a Perkin-Elmer DMA-7 instrument. The disk is immersed in a solution buffered to a pH of about 7.2 and held isothermally for a period of about 10 minutes or more prior to testing, at a temperature of about 23° to 35° C. The instrument is set to a compression measuring mode and the strain on the sample is adjusted to about 2% to 4%, depending on the sample response. The amplitude of compression is about 2 to 4 μm. Measurements of the modulus of elasticity and tan δ are taken at frequencies of about 0.1, about 1, and about 10 Hz.</p>
    <heading>3. Parameter Combinations</heading> <p>In order to assure appropriate movement of the lens on the eye, one may select materials which have a combination of the above-discussed properties. Therefore, a preferred group of extended-wear contact lens materials have (a) a modulus of elasticity (E) of about 1.5 MPa or less, (b) a short time relaxation constant (t<sub>1</sub>) of greater than about 4 seconds, and (c) an Ionoton Ion Permeability Coefficient of greater than about 0.3×10<sup>-6</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> /sec and/or an Ionoflux Diffusion Coefficient greater than about 6.4×10<sup>-6</sup> mm<sup>2</sup> /min.</p>

At about room temperature (about 20°-25 C.), poly(dimethylsiloxane)dialkanol having hydroxyalkyl (e.g., hydroxy-sec-butyl) or hydroxyalkoxy (e.g., hydroxyethylpropoxy) end groups and having a molecular weight of about 2000 to 3000 preferably about 2200, i.e., having about 28 repeating siloxane groups) is reacted with isophorone diisocyanate at about a 1:2 molar ratio, using about 0.2 weight percent (based on polydimethylsiloxane)dibutyltin dilaurate added as a catalyst The reaction is carried out for about 36 to 60 hours. To this mixture is added poly(ethylene glycol) having a molecular weight of about 400 to 1200 (more preferably about 500 to 700) at about a 2:1 or 2.1:1 molar ratio with respect to the PDMS, about 0.4 to 0.5 weight percent dibutyltin dilaurate (based on polyethylene glycol weight), and chloroform sufficient to ensure substantial mixture homogeneity. The mixture is agitated for about 12 to 18 hours, then held at a temperature of about 44° to 48° C. for about 6 to 10 hours. Excess chloroform is evaporated therefrom at about room temperature to produce a composition having about 50 weight percent solids. Then, isocyanatoethyl methacrylate is added to the mixture in about a 2:1 to 2.3:1 molar ratio with respect to PDMS. The mixture is agitated at room temperature for about 15 to 20 hours. The resulting solution contains a polysiloxane macromer having the composition described above and a number-average molecular weight of about 2000 to 10,000, more preferably about 3000 to 5000.</p>
    <p>An advantageous polymeric material formed from the Material A macromer of the present invention is a copolymer of the aforementioned Material A macromer; an acrylated or methacrylated siloxane monomer, preferably methacryloxypropyltris (trimethylsiloxy)silane (referred to herein as "Tris"); a hydrophilic monomer, preferably 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA); and preferably, a cross-lining agent such as ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA). The final copolymer composition includes about 10 to 90, preferably 70 to 90, weight percent polysiloxane macromer; about 5 to 60, preferably about 8 to 20, weight percent siloxane monomer; about 1 to 30, preferably about 1 to 5, weight percent acrylate or methacrylate monomer; and 0 to about 5, preferably up to about 2 weight percent cross-linking agent (e.g., EGDMA) based on a total dry copolymer weight. A more preferred composition includes about 80 to 84 polysiloxane macromer, about 12 to 15 weight percent TRIS, about 3 to about 4 weight percent 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, and about 0.7 to about 1.2 weight percent ethylene glycol dimethacrylate.</p>
    <p>The advantageous copolymers of the present invention may be formed from the previously-described polysiloxane macromer in the following manner. A monomeric solution is formed by adding Tris, HEMA, DAROCUR® 1173 (a photoinitator available from Ciba-Geigy Corporation), and optionally, EGDMA to the polysiloxane macromer solution. The resulting polymer precursor solution preferably contains about 83 to about 95 weight percent polysiloxane macromer solution, about 5 to about 10 weight percent Tris, about 0.5 to about 5 weight percent HEMA, about 0.1 to about 1.0 weight percent DAROCUR® 1173, and about 0.1 to about 1.0 weight percent EGDMA. More preferably, the monomer solution contains about 87 to about 93 weight percent polysiloxane macromer solution, about 7 to about 8 weight percent Tris, about 2 to about 4 weight percent HEMA, about 0.3 to about 0.7 weight percent DAROCUR® 1173, and about 0.3 to about 0.7 weight percent EGDMA. The monomer solution is preferably agitated for about 8 to about 24 hours prior to the polymerization step.</p>
    <p>Contact lenses may be prepared from the monomer solution by applying the monomer solution to appropriate lens molds and applying sufficient ultraviolet (UV) radiation to initiate polymerization. The ultraviolet light may be applied for a period of a few minutes to about 5 hours, depending on the intensity of light applied. Subsequent to polymerization, the contact lens may be extracted with a solvent, e.g., isopropanol, to remove unreacted monomers.</p>
    <p>Thus, generally, one embodiment of the present invention is a method of forming a molded polymeric article suitable for ophthalmic applications (especially a contact lens), including the following steps:</p>
    <p>(a) contacting a poly(dialkylsiloxane)dialkanol with a diisocyanate compound in the presence of a first catalyst at conditions sufficient to cause reaction of said dialkanol with said diisocyanate, thereby forming a first mixture;</p>
    <p>(b) contacting said first mixture with poly(alkylene glycol), a second catalyst, and sufficient solvent to ensure mixture homogeneity, thereby forming a second mixture;</p>
    <p>(c) evaporating sufficient solvent from said second mixture to generate a third mixture having a solids content of about 40 to 60 weight percent;</p>
    <p>(d) adding isocyanatoalkyl methacrylate to said third mixture, thereby forming a fourth mixture containing a polysiloxane macromer;</p>
    <p>(e) adding to said fourth mixture 3-methacryloxypropyltris(trimethylsiloxy)silane (TRIS), a hydrophilic monomer, a cross-linking agent and a photoinitiator, thereby forming a fifth mixture;</p>
    <p>(f) placing said fifth mixture into a mold; and</p>
    <p>(g) applying sufficient radiation to copolymerize said monomers, thereby forming said polymeric material into a molded polymeric article.</p>
    <p>The hydrophilic copolymers of the present invention are especially advantageous in the formation of "soft" contact lenses. In the use of the copolymers in the contact lens field, the lenses have a water content of about 10 to about 50 weight percent, more preferably about 10 to about 30 weight percent, and most preferably about 15 to about 22 weight percent, based on total hydrophilic polymer weight. Preferably, the fully-hydrated contact lens has an oxygen transmissibility (D<sub>k</sub> /t) of greater than 70 barrers/mm (i.e.,  (cc oxygen)(mm)/cm<sup>2</sup> !× sec/mm Hg!×10<sup>-10</sup>), more preferably greater than about 75 barrers/mm, and most preferably greater than about 87 barrers/mm.</p>

    <p>in which Y<sub>2</sub> is a functional radical which is coreactive with X<sub>3</sub> and is preferably --OH, --NH<sub>2</sub>, --COOH, --COCl, --COOR<sub>5</sub>, --CONCO or --NCO, and the variables are as defined above, and in which X<sub>1</sub> is formed from the reaction of X<sub>3</sub> with X<sub>4</sub> and Y is formed from the reaction of Y<sub>2</sub> with X<sub>3</sub>.</p>
    <p>The starting materials of formula (IV) for the preparation of the perfluoroalkyl ethers are known and many are commercially available. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,810,875 and European Patent No. 0211237 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,746,575) describe such compounds. Ausimont, Italy, markets perfluoroalkyl ether dimethanols under the name Fomblin, for example Fomblin ZDOL and Fomblin ZDOL-FX. Further Fomblin derivatives of the formula (IV) are commercially available, including, for example, Fomblin ZDISOC, in which the radical --Z--X<sub>3</sub> in the formula (IV) is CONH--C<sub>6</sub> H<sub>3</sub> (CH<sub>3</sub>)--NCO; Fomblin ZDEAL, in which the radical Z--X<sub>3</sub> in the formula (IV) is --COOR<sub>5</sub> ; and Fomblin ZDIAC, in which the radical --Z--X<sub>3</sub> in the formula (IV) is --COOH.</p>
    <p>Bifunctional radicals having a substitution pattern as per formula (V) exist in large numbers and are commercially available. Examples include, without limitation thereto: diisocyanates, such as isophorone diisocyanate and 2,2,4-trimethylhexane 1,6-diisocyanate; diols, such as glycol and cyclohexane-1,2-diol; dicarboxylic acids, such as adipic acid and maleic acid; diamines, such as ethylenediamine and hexamethylenediamine, diesters, such as diethyl phthalate and dibutyl malonate; derivatives containing various functional groups, such as 2aminoethanol, monomethyl malonate, glycolic acid, salicylic acid, glycine and glycine methyl ester.</p>
    <p>Preference is given to bifunctional derivatives of the formula (V) which have different reactivities irrespective of the nature of their functional radicals X<sub>4</sub>. In the case of identical radicals X<sub>4</sub>, this is achieved, for example, through different steric requirements in the direct vicinity of a radical X<sub>4</sub>. Examples thereof are isophorone diisocyanate, 2,2,4-trimethylhexane 1,6-diisocyanate and toluene 2,4-diisocyanate. The advantage of using bifunctional derivatives of formula (V) of different reactivity is that the chain length of polymer Q (number of segments (a), (b) and (c)) is easily adjustable and controllable.</p>
    <p>α,ω-substituted siloxanes of formula (VII) are likewise commercially available, for example α,ω-hydroxypropyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane KF6001 from Shin-Etsu.</p>
    <p>The novel compounds can be prepared in the presence or absence of a solvent. It is advantageous to use a substantially inert solvent, i.e., one which does not participate in the reaction. Suitable examples thereof are ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), diethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether or dioxane, halogenated hydrocarbons, such as chloroform or methylene chloride, bipolar aprotic solvents, such as acetonitrile, acetone, dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), hydrocarbons, such as hexane, petroleum ether, toluene or xylene, and furthermore pyridine or N-methylmorpholine.</p>
    <p>In the preparation of novel compounds, the reactants are advantageously employed in stoichiometric amounts. The reaction temperature can be, for example, from -30° C. to 150° C., preferably from 0° to room temperature. The reaction times are in the range of about 15 minutes to 7 days, preferably about 12 hours. If necessary, the reaction is carried out under argon or nitrogen as protective gas. In urethane-forming reactions, a suitable catalyst, for example, dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTDL), is advantageously added.</p>
    <p>The present Material "B" furthermore relates to a polymer comprising a product of the polymerization of at least one compound of formula (I) as defined above and, if desired, at least one vinylic comonomer (a). In a preferred composition of a novel copolymer, the proportion by weight of a compound of formula (I) is in the range of 100 to 0.5%, in particular in the range of 80 to 10%, preferably in the range of 70 to 30%, based on the total polymer.</p>
    <p>In a preferred polymer comprising a product of the polymerization of at least one compound of the formula (I), comonomer (a) is absent and the polymer is a homopolymer.</p>
    <p>A comonomer (a) present in the novel polymer can be hydrophilic or hydrophobic or a mixture thereof. Suitable comonomers are, in particular, those which are usually used in the production of contact lenses and biomedical materials. A hydrophobic comonomer (a) is taken to mean a monomer which typically gives a homopolymer which is insoluble in water and can absorb less than 10% by weight of water. Analogously, a hydrophilic comonomer (a) is taken to mean a monomer which typically gives a homopolymer which is soluble in water or can absorb at least 10% by weight of water.

    <p>Preference is given, for example, to acrylonitrile, C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>4</sub> alkyl esters of vinylically unsaturated carboxylic acids having 3 to 5 carbon atoms or vinyl esters of carboxylic acids having up to 5 carbon atoms.</p>
    <p>Examples of suitable hydrophobic comonomers (a) are methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, isopropyl acrylate, cyclohexyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, propyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate, vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl butyrate, vinyl valerate, styrene, chloroprene, vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, acrylonitrile, 1-butene, butadiene, methacrylonitrile, vinyltoluene, vinyl ethyl ether, perfluorohexylethylthiocarbonylaminoethyl methacrylate, isobornyl methacrylate, trifluoroethyl methacrylate, hexafluoroisopropyl methacrylate, hexafluorobutyl methacrylate, tristrimethylsilyloxysilylpropyl methacrylate (TRIS), 3-methacryloxy propylpentamethyldisiloxane and bis(methacryloxypropyl)tetramethyldisiloxane.</p>
    <p>Preferred examples of hydrophobic comonomers (a) are methyl methacrylate, TRIS and acrylonitrile.</p>
    <p>Suitable hydrophilic comonomers (a) are, without this being an exhaustive list, hydroxyl-substituted lower alkyl acrylates and methacrylates, acrylamide, methacrylamide, (lower allyl)acrylamides and -methacrylamides, ethoxylated acrylates and methacrylates, hydroxyl-substituted (lower alkyl)acrylamides and -methacrylamides, hydroxyl-substituted lower alkyl vinyl ethers, sodium vinylsulfonate, sodium styrenesulfonate, 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid, N-vinylpyrrole, N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone, 2-vinyloxazoline, 2-vinyl4,4'-dialkyloxazolin-5-one, 2- and 4-vinylpyridine, vinylically unsaturated carboxylic acids having a total of 3 to 5 carbon atoms, amino(lower alkyl)- (where the term "amino" also includes quaternary ammonium), mono(lower alkylamino)(lower alkyl) and di(lower alkylamino)(lower alkyl)acrylates and methacrylates, allyl alcohol and the like. Preference is given, for example, to N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone, acrylamide, methacrylamide, hydroxyl-substituted lower alkyl acrylates and methacrylates, hydroxy-substituted (lower alkyl)acrylamides and -methacrylamides and vinylically unsaturated carboxylic acids having a total of 3 to 5 carbon atoms.</p>

    <p>The novel polymers are synthesized in a manner known per se from the corresponding monomers (the term monomer here also including a macromer according to the definition of the formula (I)) by a polymerization reaction customary to the person skilled in the art. Usually, a mixture of the abovementioned monomers is warmed with addition of a free-radical former. Examples of such free-radical formers are azoisobutyronitrile (AIBN), potassium peroxodisulfate, dibenzoyl peroxide, hydrogen peroxide and sodium percarbonate. If, for example, said compounds are warmed, free radicals form with homolysis, and can then initiate, for example, a polymerization.</p>
    <p>A polymerization reaction can particularly preferably be carried out using a photoinitiator. In this case, the term photopolymerization is used. In the photopolymerization, it is appropriate to add a photoinitiator which can initiate free-radical polymerization and/or crosslinking by using light. Examples thereof are customary to the person skilled in the art; suitable photoinitiators are, in particular, benzoin methyl ether, 1-hydroxycyclohexylphenyl ketone, Darocur and Irgacur products, preferably Darocur® 1173 and Irgacur® 2959. Also suitable are reactive photoinitiators, which can be incorporated, for example, into a macromer, or can be used as a specific comonomer (a). Examples thereof are given in European Patent No. 0632329. The photopolymerization can then be initiated by actinic radiation, for example light, in particular UV light having a suitable wavelength. The spectral requirements can, if necessary, be controlled appropriately by addition of suitable photosensitizers.</p>
    <p>A polymerization can be carried out in the presence or absence of a solvent. Suitable solvents are in principle all solvents which dissolve the monomers used, for example water, alcohols, such as lower alkanols, for example ethanol or methanol, furthermore carboxamides, such as dimethylformamide, dipolar aprotic solvents, such as dimethyl sulfoxide or methyl ethyl ketone, ketones, for example acetone or cyclohexanone, hydrocarbons, for example toluene, ethers, for example THF, dimethoxyethane or dioxane, halogenated hydrocarbons, for example trichloroethane, and also mixtures of suitable solvents, for example mixtures of water and an alcohol, for example a water/ethanol or water/methanol mixture.</p>
    <p>A polymer network can, if desired, be reinforced by addition of a crosslinking agent, for example a polyunsaturated comonomer (b). In this case, the term crosslinked polymers is used. The invention, therefore, furthermore relates to a crosslinked polymer comprising the product of the polymerization of a macromer of the formula (I), if desired with at least one vinylic comonomer (a) and with at least one comonomer (b).</p>
    <p>Examples of typical comonomers (b) are allyl(meth)acrylate, lower alkylene glycol di(meth)acrylate, poly(lower alkylene)glycol di(meth)acrylate, lower alkylene di(meth)acrylate, divinyl ether, divinyl sulfone, di- and trivinylbenzene, trimethylolpropane tri(meth)acrylate, pentaerythritol tetra(meth)acrylate, bisphenol A di(meth)acrylate, methylenebis(meth)acrylamide, triallyl phthalate and diallyl phthalate.</p>
    <p>The amount of comonomer (b) used is expressed in a proportion by weight based on the total polymer and is in the range from 20 to 0.05%, in particular in the range from 10 to 0.1%, preferably in the range from 2 to 0.1%.</p>
    <heading>3. Material "C"</heading> <p>Material "C" polymers are formed by polymerizing polymerizable macromers which contain free hydroxyl groups. Macromers which are built up, for example, from an aminoalkylated polysiloxane which is derivatized with at least one polyol component containing an unsaturated polymerizable side chain are disclosed. Polymers can be prepared on the one hand from the macromers according to the invention by homopolymerization. The macromers mentioned furthermore can be mixed and polymerized with one or more hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic comonomers. A special property of the macromers according to the invention is that they function as the element which controls microphase separation between selected hydrophilic and hydrophobic components in a crosslinked end product. The hydrophilic/hydrophobic microphase separation is in the region of less than 300 nm. The macromers are preferably crosslinked at the phase boundaries between, for example, an acrylate comonomer on the one hand and an unsaturated polymerizable side chain of polyols bonded to polysiloxane on the other hand, by covalent bonds and additionally by reversible physical interactions, for example hydrogen bridges. These are formed, for example, by numerous amide or urethane groups. The continuous siloxane phase which exists in the phase composite has the effect of producing a surprisingly high permeability to oxygen.</p>

A carbohydrate is understood as meaning a mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, oligo- or polysaccharide. A carbohydrate lactone is understood as meaning the lactone of an aldonic or uronic acid. An aldonic or uronic acid is, for example, a carboxylic acid formed by oxidation of a mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, oligo- or polysaccharide. Examples of aldonic acid lactones are gluconolactone, galactonolactone, lactobionolactone or maltoheptaonolactone; examples of uronic acid lactones are glucuronic acid lactone, mannuronic acid lactone or iduronic acid lactone.

    <p>Suitable hydrophilic comonomers (a) include, without this list being conclusive, hydroxyl-substituted lower alkyl acrylates and methacrylates, acrylamide, methacrylamide, lower alkylacrylamides and -methacrylamides, ethoxylated acrylates and methacrylates, hydroxylsubstituted lower alkylacrylamides and -methacrylamides, hydroxyl-substituted lower alkyl vinyl ethers, sodium vinylsulfonate, sodium styrenesulfonate, 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid, N-vinylpyrrole, N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone, 2-vinyloxazoline, 2-vinyl-4,4'-dialkyloxazolin-5-one, 2- and 4-vinylpyridine, vinylically unsaturated carboxylic acids having a total of 3 to 5 carbon atoms, amino-lower alkyl (where the term "amino" also includes quaternary ammonium), mono-lower alkylamino-lower alkyl and di-lower alkylamino-lower alkyl acrylates and methacrylates, allyl alcohol and the like.

    <p>The polymers according to the invention are built up in a manner known per se from the corresponding monomers (the term monomers here also including a macromer according to the invention) by a polymerization reaction with which the expert is familiar. Usually, a mixture of the abovementioned monomers is heated, with the addition of an agent which forms free radicals. Such an agent which forms free radicals is, for example, azoisobutyronitrile (AIBN), potassium peroxodisulfate, dibenzoyl peroxide, hydrogen peroxide or sodium percarbonate. If the compounds mentioned are heated, for example, free radicals are then formed, by homolysis, and can then, for example, initiate a polymerization.</p>
    <p>A polymerization reaction can particularly preferably be carried out using a photoinitiator. Photopolymerization is the term used in this case. For photopolymerization, a photoinitiator which can initiate free radical polymerization and/or crosslinking by the use of light is suitably added. Examples of this are familiar to the expert, and specifically, suitable photoinitiators are benzoin methyl ether, 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone and Darocur and Irgacur types, preferably Darocur 1173® and Darocur 2959®. Reactive photoinitiators which can be incorporated, for example, into a macromer or can be used as a special comonomer (a) are also suitable. Examples of these are to be found in EP 632 329. The photopolymerization can then be triggered off by actinic radiation, for example light, in particular UV light of a suitable wavelength. The spectral requirements can be controlled accordingly, if appropriate, by addition of suitable photosensitizers.</p>
    <p>Polymerization can be carried out in the presence or absence of a solvent. Suitable solvents are in principle all solvents which dissolve the monomers used, for example water, alcohols, such as lower alkanols, for example ethanol or methanol, and furthermore carboxylic acid amides, such as dimethylformamide, dipolar aprotic solvents, such as dimethyl sulfoxide or methyl ethyl ketone, ketones, for example acetone or cyclohexanone, hydrocarbons, for example toluene, ethers, for example THF, dimethoxyethane or dioxane, and halogenated hydrocarbons, for example trichloroethane, and also mixtures of suitable solvents, for example mixtures of water with an alcohol, for example a water/ethanol or a water/methanol mixture.</p>
    <p>If appropriate, a polymer network can be intensified by addition of a so-called crosslinking agent, for example a polyunsaturated comonomer (b). The invention furthermore relates to a polymer comprising the polymerization product of a macromer according to the invention with, if appropriate, at least one vinylic comonomer (a) and with at least one comonomer (b).</p>

    <p>The prepolymer mixture may be formed into lenses and other ophthalmic devices by any of a number of techniques known in the art and disclosed herein. Preferably, the prepolymer mixture is conveyed into a concave half of a lens mold, the convex mold half is mated with the concave mold half, and an appropriate amount of radiation is applied to initiate polymerization. While ultraviolet (UV) radiation is preferred, a number of other energy sources known in the art and disclosed herein may also be used.</p>
    <p>The Material D ophthalmic lens is preferably a polymerization product of the following macromeric and monomeric components, based on total weight of polymerizable material:</p>

    <p>In another preferred embodiment, about 0.2 to 1.0 weight percent MAA is used, together with the components (a), (b), and (c) in the above-cited amounts.</p>
    <p>II. OPHTHALMICALLY COMPATIBLE SURFACES</p>
    <p>The ophthalmic lenses of the present invention have a surface which is biocompatible with ocular tissue and ocular fluids during the desired extended period of contact. In one preferred embodiment, the ophthalmic lenses of the present invention include a core material, as defined above, surrounded, at least in part, by a surface which is more hydrophilic and lipophobic than the core material. A hydrophilic surface is desirable in order to enhance the compatibility of the lens with the ocular tissues and tear fluids. As surface hydrophilicity increases, undesirable attraction and adherence of lipids and proteinaceous matter typically decreases. There are factors other than surface hydrophilicity, such as immunological response, which may contribute to deposit accumulation on the lens. Deposition of lipids and proteinaceous matter causes haze on the lens, thereby reducing visual clarity. Proteinaceous deposits may also cause other problems, such as irritation to the eye. After extended periods of continuous or intermittent wear, the lens must be removed from the eye for cleaning, i.e., deposit removal. Therefore, increased surface hydrophilicity, and concomittent reductions in deposits of biological matter, allows increased wear time.</p>
    <p>"Surface treatment processes", as used herein, refers to processes to render a surface more ophthalmically compatible, in which, by means of contact with a vapor or liquid, and/or by means of application of an energy source (1) a coating is applied to the surface of an article, (2) chemical species are adsorbed onto the surface of an article, (3) the chemical nature (e.g., electrostatic charge) of chemical groups on the surface of an article are altered, or (4) the surface properties of an article are otherwise modified.</p>
    <p>There are a variety of methods disclosed in the art for rendering a surface of a material hydrophilic. For example, the lens may be coated with a layer of a hydrophilic polymeric material. Alternatively, hydrophilic groups may be grafted onto the surface of the lens, thereby producing a monolayer of hydrophilic material. These coating or grafting processes may be effected by a number of processes, including without limitation thereto, exposing the lens to plasma gas or immersing the lens in a monomeric solution under appropriate conditions.</p>
    <p>Another set of methods of altering the surface properties of a lens involves treatment prior to polymerization to form the lens. For example, the mold may be treated with a plasma (i.e., an ionized gas), a static electrical charge, irradiation, or other energy source, thereby causing the prepolymerzation mixture immediately adjacent the mold surface to differ in composition from the core of the prepolymerization mixture.</p>
    <p>A preferred class of surface treatment processes are plasma processes, in which an ionized gas is applied to the surface of an article. Plasma gases and processing conditions are described more fully in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,312,575 and 4,632,844, which are incorporated herein by reference. The plasma gas is preferably a mixture of lower alkanes and nitrogen, oxygen or an inert gas.</p>
    <p>In a preferred embodiment, the lens is plasma treated in the presence of a mixture of (a) a C<sub>1-6</sub> alkane and (b) a gas selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, argon, oxygen, and mixtures thereof. In a more preferred embodiment, the lens is plasma treated in the presence of a mixture of methane and air.</p>
    <p>IV. UTILITY</p>
    <p>A. Ophthalmic Lenses</p>
    <p>The novel polymers or crosslinked polymers can be converted into ophthalmic moldings in a manner known in the art, in particular into contact lenses, for example by carrying out the photopolymerization or photocrosslinking of the novel polymers in a suitable contact lens mold. Examples of novel ophthalmic moldings, in addition to contact lenses, include without limitation thereto, contact lenses for vision correction, contact lenses for eye color modification, ophthalmic drug delivery devices, ophthalmic wound healing devices, and the like.</p>
    <p>B. Contact Lenses</p>
    <p>A specific embodiment of the invention is directed to contact lenses which comprise essentially a novel polymer or polymeric network. Such contact lenses have a range of unusual and extremely advantageous properties. Amongst these properties are, for example, their excellent compatibility with the human cornea (if necessary after suitable surface treatment (coating)) and with tear fluid, which is based on a balanced ratio between water content and water permeability, oxygen permeability and mechanical and adsorptive properties. This balance of desirable properties results in high comfort and the absence of irritation and allergenic effects. Owing to their favorable permeability properties with respect to various salts, nutrients, water and diverse other components of tear fluid and gases (CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>), the novel contact lenses have no effect, or virtually no effect, on the natural metabolic processes in the cornea. In contrast to many other siloxane-containing contact lenses, the present innovative extended-wear lenses have chemical and mechanical properties and ion permeability sufficient to avoid the undesired binding effect. Furthermore, the novel contact lenses have high dimensional stability and shelf life.</p>
    <p>It must be emphasized that this balance of properties, especially the high ion permeability in combination with the high oxygen permeability, is key to producing a true extended-wear contact lens. The high oxygen permeability is required to prevent corneal swelling, thereby reducing the likelihood of ocular damage and wearer discomfort during periods of extended wear. The high ion permeability enables the lens to move on the eye such that corneal health is not substantially altered and wearer comfort is acceptable during a period of extended, continuous contact with ocular tissue and ocular fluids.</p>
    <p>The preferred extended-wear contact lenses of the present invention are those which are comfortable over the period of extended wear. If the lens diameter is too small, the eyelids will not cover any portion of the lens when the eye is open. Thus, the eyelids will contact the edge of the lens each time the eyelid is closed. This repeated eyelid-lens interaction typically causes irritation, wearer discomfort, and lens dislodgement. Accordingly, the preferred contact lens diameters are those which are sufficiently large to minimize eyelid-lens interaction and the associated irritation. Preferably, the contact lens has a diameter of about 12 to about 16 millimeters, more preferably about 13 to 15 mm, and most preferably about 13.5 to 14.8 mm.</p>
    <p>V. METHODS OF USE AS EXTENDED-WEAR LENSES</p>
    <p>The above-described ophthalmic lenses have special utility as extended-wear contact lenses. Contact lenses having sufficient oxygen and water transmission rates from inner (base curve) to outer (front curve) surface may be continuously worn for long periods of time without substantial cornea swelling or wearer discomfort. The method of wear includes (a) applying the lens to the eye and (b) allowing the lens to remain in intimate contact with the eye and tear fluids for a period of at least 24 hours without substantial adverse impact on cornea health or wearer comfort.</p>
    <p>A preferred method includes additional steps of (c) removing the lens from the ocular environment; (d) treating the lens (i.e., disinfecting or cleaning the lens); (e) re-applying the lens to the eye; and (f) allowing the lens to remain in intimate contact with the eye and tear fluids for a period of at least an additional 24 hours without substantial adverse impact on corneal health or wearer comfort.</p>
    <p>In a preferred embodiment, the lens is worn for a continuous period of at least four (4) days without substantial corneal swelling or wearer discomfort. In another preferred embodiment, the lens is worn for a continuous period of at least seven (7) days without substantial corneal swelling or wearer discomfort. In another preferred embodiment, the lens is worn for a continuous period of at least 14 days without substantial corneal swelling or wearer discomfort. In yet another preferred embodiment, the lens is worn for a continuous period of at least 30 days without substantial corneal swelling or wearer discomfort</p>
    <p>VI. METHODS OF MANUFACTURE</p>
    <p>The ophthalmic lens may be manufactured, generally, by thoroughly mixing the oxyperm and ionoperm polymerizable materials, applying an appropriate amount of the mixture to a lens mold cavity, and initiating polymerization. Photoinitiators, such as those commercially available photoinitiators disclosed above, may be added to the prepolymerization mixture to aid in initiating polymerization. Polymerization may be initiated by a number of well known techniques, which, depending on the polymerizable material, may include application of radiation such as microwave, thermal, e-beam and ultraviolet. A preferred method of initiating polymerization is by application of ultraviolet radiation.</p>
    <p>It has been discovered that the ion and/or water permeability of some of the aforementioned core materials may be increased by initiating and completing polymerization in an atmosphere which is substantially free of oxygen. Suitable gases which are readily commercially available include, without limitation thereto, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the oxyperm and ionoperm polymerizable materials are polymerized in an atmosphere having less than about 10000 ppm oxygen. More preferably, the atmosphere surrounding the polymerizable material contains less than about 1000 ppm oxygen. Even more preferably, the surrounding atmosphere contains less than about 100 ppm oxygen, while the most preferred oxygen content is less than about 20 ppm.</p>
    <p>In the aforementioned embodiment, the prepolymer mixture must be degassed prior to polymerization. The degassing may be accomplished by a number of techniques known in the art. One technique for degassing the prepolymer mixture involves the use of a series of freezing and thawing steps which are repeated until the appropriate gas concentration level is achieved in the prepolymer mixture. This freeze/thaw method involves cooling the prepolymer mixture until the mixture solidifies, applying a vacuum to the solidified prepolymer mixture, discontinuing the vacuum, and thawing the prepolymer mixture until the mixture is again in liquid form. While this degassing technique is advantageous in a laboratory setting, other degassing techniques known in the art may be more advantageous for commercial lens manufacturing processes.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, the atmosphere surrounding the lens mold may include oxygen, under certain conditions. For example, if the lens mold halves seal adequately to one another and the lens mold material has a low rate of oxygen permeability (e.g., polypropylene), it is possible to polymerize a degassed prepolymer mixture in a mold surrounded by ambient air without reaching prepolymer oxygen concentrations sufficiently high to substantially reduce ion or water permeability of the final lens. Thus, in another preferred embodiment of double-sided molding, the lens is formed by the following steps: (1) the prepolymer mixture is degassed, (2) a lens mold half is filled with the prepolymer mixture, (3) the mold halves are sealed to one another, and (4) the polymerization is initiated to form the lens, where the lens mold halves are formed from a material having a low oxygen permeability and steps (2)-(4) may occur in the presence or absence of oxygen. In this embodiment, it is preferred that the lens molds are stored in an inert substantially oxygen-free atmosphere, e.g., nitrogen or carbon dioxide, prior to use.</p>
    <p>An essential feature of the manufacturing methods of the present innovative lenses is that a balance of high oxygen permeability and high ion permeability is achieved. Manufacturing techniques and conditions which result in lowering either the oxygen permeability or the ion permeability below levels sufficient to maintain good corneal health and on-eye movement during periods of extended wear are unacceptable to produce the innovative extended-wear contact lenses of the present invention.</p>
    <p>Preferably, the manufacturing method produces a contact lens having a Dk/t of at least 70 barrers/mm and a Ionoton Ion Permeability Coefficient of at least 0.2×10<sup>-6</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> /sec. More preferably, the manufacturing method produces a contact lens having a Dk/t of at least 75 barrers/mm and a Ionoton Ion Permeability Coefficient of at least 0.3×10<sup>-6</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> /sec. The manufacturing method preferably provides a contact lens having a Dk/t of at least 87 barrers/mm and a Ionoton Ion Permeability Coefficient of at least 0.4×10<sup>-6</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> /sec.</p>
    <p>The previous disclosure will enable one having ordinary skill in the art to practice the invention. In order to better enable the reader to understand specific embodiments and the advantages thereof, reference to the following examples is suggested. However, the following examples should not be read to limit the scope of the invention.</p>
    <p>Examples A-D are arranged in accordance with the materials defined above. Thus, Examples A-1, A-2, etc. relate to Material "A" as defined above, Examples B-1, B-2, etc. relate to Material "B" as defined above, Examples C-1, C-2, etc. relate to Material "C", and Examples D-1, D-2, etc. relate to Material "D". Temperatures are stated in degrees Celsius unless otherwise specified.</p>
    <p>Examples E, F and G are directed to demonstrating a correlation between on-eye movement and the Ionoton Ion Permeability Coefficient, the Ionoflux Ion Permeability Coefficient, and the Hydrodell Water Permeability Coefficient, respectively.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE A-1</heading> <p>A polysiloxane macromer is prepared by reacting, at room temperature (about 21 C.), one mole equivalent (about 100 grams) of poly(dimethylsiloxane)dialkanol (Shin Etsu Chemical Co., Tokyo, Japan) having hydroxyethyl propoxy end groups with 2 mole equivalents (about 21.2 grams) of isophorone diisocyanate (Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis.) in the presence of about 0.2 grams dibutyltin dilaurate catalyst (Pfaltz &amp; Bauer, Inc., Waterbury, Conn.). After about 48 hours reaction time, 2.02 mole equivalents (about 38.7 grams) of poly(ethylene glycol) ("PEG", about 610 g/mol Mn, Dow Chemical Corp., Midland, Mich.) and about 0.17 grams of dibutyltin dilaurate (about 0.43% by weight PEG) are added to 80 grams of the reaction product from the prior step. Sufficient chloroform (Aldrich Chemical Co.) is added to the mixture to make the mixture homogeneous. This mixture is stirred at room temperature for about 15 hours. Next, the mixture is stirred for about 8 hours at a temperature of about 44 to 48 C., with the temperature held substantially constant by a surrounding oil bath. The chloroform is then evaporated, in order to achieve a final concentration of about 50% by weight solids, by stirring the mixture at room temperature for about 8 hours. Then, about 2.14 mole equivalents (about 10.4 grams) of isocyanatoethyl methacrylate ("IEM", Monomer Polymer, Inc., Feasterville, Pa.) is added to the mixture. Finally, the mixture is covered with aluminum foil and stirred at room temperature for about 17 hours, yielding a polysiloxane-containing macromer having a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of about 4000 grams per mole.</p>
    <p>The macromeric solution is then polymerized, in the presence of about 0.5 weight percent DAROCUR® 1173 photoinitiator (Ciba-Geigy Corporation, Ardsley, N.Y.) to form contact lenses. Polypropylene contact lens molds are filled with the copolymer precursor solution. Ultraviolet light (about 300 to 400 nm) at about 3-6 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> is applied to the solution in the mold for about 3 hours at room temperature. The UV light, in conjunction with the photoinitiator, causes polymerization, thereby allowing the solution to form a contact lens having the shape of the mold. The lenses are extracted with isopropanol to remove the remaining chloroform solvent and any unreacted components. The product is a polysiloxane-containing polymeric contact lens.</p>
    <p>Prior to taking oxygen permeability measurements, the lenses are hydrated by placing the lenses in isotonic buffered saline solution for at least eight hours. After hydration, if necessary because of handling, each lens is cleaned with MIRAFLOW® Daily Cleaner (CIBA Vision Corporation, Duluth, Ga.) to remove grease and lipids prior to testing. Excess MIRAFLOW® cleaner is removed by rinsing with saline or purified water.</p>
    <p>Oxygen fluxes (J) are measured at 34 C in a wet cell (i.e., gas streams are maintained at about 100% relative humidity) using a Dk 1000 instrument. Oxygen transmissibility, D<sub>k</sub> /t, is determined as outlined in the portions of the specification relating to oxygen permeability and transmissibility.</p>

    <p>The copolymer precursor solution is then polymerized to form contact lenses. Polypropylene contact lens molds are filled with the copolymer precursor solution. Ultraviolet light (about 300 to 400 nm) at about 3-6 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> is applied to the solution in the mold for about 3 hours at room temperature. The UV light causes polymerization, thereby allowing the solution to form a contact lenses having the shape of the mold. The lens are extracted with isopropanol to remove remaining chloroform solvent and any unreacted components. A preferred resulting polymer contains about 81.8 weight percent polysiloxane macromer, about 13.6% TRIS, about 3.6% 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, and about 0.9% EDGMA.</p>

Microtitration shows 0.36 meq/g of hydroxyl groups (theory 0.37 meq/g). 13.78 g (88.9 mmol) of 2-isocyanatoethylmethacrylate (IEM) are added under argon to 247 g of the α,ω-hydroxypropyl-terminated polysiloxane-perfluoropolyether-polysiloxane three-block copolymer (a three-block copolymer on stoichiometric average, but other block lengths are also present). The mixture is stirred at room temperature for three days. Microtitration then no longer shows any isocyanate groups (detection limit 0.01 meq/g). 0.34 meq/g of methacryl groups are found (theory 0.34 meq/g).</p>
    <p>The macromer prepared in this way is completely colourless and clear. It can be stored in air at room temperature for several months in the absence of light without any change in molecular weight.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE B-2</heading> <heading>Macromer synthesis</heading> <p>The first step of the macromer synthesis described under Example B-1 is repeated. An isocyanate titration of the perfluoropolyether reacted with IPDI gives a content of 1.33 meq/g of NCO (theory 1.35 meq/g).</p>
    <p>In a second step, 87.1 g of the α,ωhydroxypropyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane TegomerH-Si2111 (Th. Goldschmidt AG, Essen) having a mean molecular weight of 890 g/mol (2.25 meq/g of hydroxyl groups according to titration) are dissolved in 87 ml of toluene. After the reaction has been carried out as indicated under B-<sub>1</sub> and the solvent has been removed, a hydroxyl group content of 0.66 meq/g is determined by microtitration (theory 0.60 meq/g). The resultant intermediate is in turn reacted with a stoichiometric amount of isocyanatoethyl methacrylate. Microtitration then no longer shows any isocyanate groups (detection limit 0.01 meq/g). 0.56 meq/g of methacryl groups are found (theory 0.53 meq/g). The macromer prepared in this way is completely colourless and clear and has a long shelf life.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE B-3</heading> <heading>Macromer synthesis</heading> <p>The first step of the macromer synthesis described under Example B- 1 is repeated, but using a different perfluoropolyether: Fomblin® ZDOLTX (from Ausimont S.p.A., Milan). This material is terminated by O--CF<sub>2</sub> --CH<sub>2</sub> --(OCH<sub>2</sub> CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub> --OH (where n=0, 1 or 2). The material used has a mean molecular weight of 1146 g/mol, and contains 1.72 meq/g of hydroxyl groups according to end-group analysis. An isocyanate titration of the perfluoropolyether reacted with IPDI shows a content of 1.23 meq/g of NCO (theory 1.25 meq/g).</p>
    <p>In the second step, a stoichiometric amount of Tegomer Hi-Si2111 and toluene are again added. After the reaction has been carried out as indicated under Example B-1 and the solvent has been removed, a hydroxyl group content of 0.63 meq/g is determined by microtitration (theory 0.58 meq/g). The resultant intermediate is in turn reacted with a stoichiometric amount of isocyanatoethyl methacrylate. Microtitration then no longer shows any isocyanate groups (detection limit 0.01 meq/g). 0.55 meq/g of methacryl groups are found (theory 0.51 meq/g). The macromer prepared in this way is completely colourless and clear and has a long shelf life.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE B4</heading> <heading>Macromer synthesis</heading> <p>The first step of the macromer synthesis described under Example B-1 is repeated, but 5.0 g of Fomblin/ZDOL and 2.18 g of IPDI are employed. When the reaction is complete, microtitration shows an isocyanate group content of 1.31 meq/g of hydroxyl groups (theory 1.36 meq/g).</p>
    <p>The second step of the synthesis described under Example B-1 is likewise carried out analogously, the stoichiometric ratio between isocyanate-terminated perfluoropolyether and hydroxypropyl-terminated polysiloxane being 2:3. After the reaction has been completed and the solvent has been removed, microtitration shows a content of 0.2 meq/g of hydroxyl groups (theory 0.1 8 meq/g).</p>
    <p>The third step of the synthesis described under Example B-1 is likewise carried out analogously, IEM being employed in a precisely stoichiometric ratio. After the reaction, free isocyanate groups can no longer be detected (detection limit 0.01 meq/g). 0.19 meq/g of methacryl groups are found (theory 0.19 meq/g).</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE B-5</heading> <heading>Production of contact lenses</heading> <p>13.0 g of macromer from Example B-1 are dissolved in 5.6 g of ethanol (Fluka, puriss. p.a.) (70% by weight solution). After complete homogenization of the solution, 5.2 g of 3-tris(trimethylsiloxy)silylpropyl methacrylate (TRIS from Shin-Etsu, product No. KF-2801), 7.8 g of freshly distilled dimethylacrylamide (DMA) and 160 mg of photoinitiator Darocur® 1173 (Ciba) are added. This solution is filtered through a Teflon membrane having a pore width of 0.45 mm under an argon pressure of from 1 to 2 atm. The filtered solution is frozen in a flask in liquid nitrogen, the flask is evacuated under a high vacuum, and the solution is returned to room temperature with the flask sealed. This degassing operation is repeated twice. The flask containing the macromer/comonomer solution is then transferred into a glove box with an inertgas atmosphere, where the solution is pipetted into dust-free contact-lens moulds made from polypropylene. The moulds are closed, and the polymerization reaction is effected by UV irradiation (15 mW/cm2, 5 min.), with simultaneous crosslinking. The moulds are then opened and placed in ethanol, causing the resultant lenses to swell out of the moulds. The lenses are extracted for 24 hours with constantly replenished distilled dichloromethane and subsequently dried in a high vacuum. The dried lenses are equilibrated in phosphate-buffered physiological saline solution in autoclave-resistant vials and then autoclaved at 120° C. for 30 minutes. All physical data measurements are carried out on autoclaved lenses.</p>
    <p>The lenses produced in this way are characterized by the following values: oxygen permeability (Dk) 77 barrer (determined by the "wet" method described below), water content of the equilibrated lenses 32 percent by weight, elongation at break at 35° C. 360%, modulus of elasticity 30° C. 0.5 MPa (measured using a Minimat from Polymer Laboratories, UK).</p>
    <heading>"Wet" measurement of the oxygen permeability</heading> <p>The oxygen permeability of a material is determined by the coulometric method. To this end, pre-autoclaved lenses are clamped in a holder and then covered on the upper side with a 2 cm layer of water. A gas mixture comprising 21% of oxygen and 790% of nitrogen is passed continuously through the water layer with swirling. The oxygen which diffuses through the lens is measured using a coulometric detector. The reference values are those measured on commercially available contact lenses using this method. Cibasoft® (CIBA-Vision, HEMA lens) gives a measurement of approx. 7-10 barrer, and Excelens® (CIBA-Vision, PVA lens) gives a measurement of approx. 22 barrer.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the oxygen permeability of, for example, contact lenses is frequently given in the literature as a straight Dk value without further definition and frequently without giving any reference material. These are usually values determined on dry material (dry measurement). A comparative measurement of the oxygen permeability of polymer B-5 shows the differences:</p>
    <p>a) "wet" measurement: 77 barrer</p>
    <p>b) dry measurement: 158 barrer</p>

Titration of the amino groups with perchloric acid indicates a reaction conversion of 99% (&lt;0.01 meq of NH2/g). Here also, a colourless optically clear macromer is obtained.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE C-9 and C-10</heading> <p>The reactions are carried out analogously to Example C-1.

Instead of DBTDL, catalytic amounts of 1,4-diazabicyclo(2.2.2)octane (DABCO) or 4 dimethylamino-pyridine (DMAP) are added and the reaction is continued as described under Example C-1. In both cases, an optically clear, colourless rubber-elastic macromer results in a manner corresponding to Example C-1.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE C-11</heading> <p>The reaction is carried out analogously to Example C-1 . In a manner corresponding to Example C-8, 0.1 mol of lactobionic acid 1,5-lactone is suspended in 50 ml of absolute THF and the suspension is added dropwise to a solution of amino-functionalized polydimethylsiloxane (KF-8003) in 180 ml of absolute THF and 20 ml of DMSO (pure, 99%). The reaction time is increased to about 48 hours. A residual content of 0.07 meq of NH<sub>2</sub> /g can be detected, and is reacted completely by addition of the corresponding molar amount of D(+)gluconic acid d-lactone to the reaction solution. The colourless highly transparent product has a residual content of amino groups of &lt;0.01 meq/g.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE C-12</heading> <p>52.09 g (9.78 mmol) of purified amino-functionalized polydimethylsiloxane (X-22-161-C, Shin Etsu JP), dissolved in 110 ml of absolute THF, are initially introduced into the reaction vessel under an inert gas atmosphere, and 1.14 g (6.52 mmol) of D-glucaro-1,4:6,3-dilactone, dissolved in 20 ml of absolute THF, are added. The reaction solution is stirred at room temperature for 15 hours and then worked up in a manner corresponding to Example C-1. The amine content is 0.134 meq/g. The terminal amino groups of the resulting penta-block macromer are reacted with gluconolactone in the following reaction step. 41.84 g (5.146 meq of NH2) of the above macromer and 0.917 g (5.15 mmol) of D(+)gluconic acid d-lactone are suspended in 300 ml of absolute THF and the suspension is stirred under nitrogen at 40° C. for 18 hours. The filtered solution is then concentrated and the residue is dried under 3 Pa (0.03 mbar) for 48 hours. A highly viscous optically clear substance having a residual content of amino groups of 0.013 meq/g results.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE C-13</heading> <p>Preparation of an amino- and perfluoroalkyl-functionalized polydimethylsiloxane</p>
    <p>3.0 ml of absolute toluene are added to 15 g of poly(dimethylsiloxane-co-methylhydrosiloxane) (Bayer Silopren U-230; 10,000 g/mol; 2.3 mmol of Si--H/g), and 1.72 g (9.2 mmol) of allylphthalimide  CAS Reg. No. 5428-09-1! are then added. The mixture is frozen several times and the flask evacuated and then brought to room temperature again. The flask is then let down with argon. 0.7 ml of a 0.005 molar solution of Lamoreaux catalyst (prepared in accordance with U.S. Pat. No. 3,220,972, General Electric) in absolute toluene (100 ppm of Pt/mol of Si--H) is added and the mixture is heated to 80° C. After a reaction time of half an hour, a colourless, clear to slightly cloudy solution, the 1H-NMR spectrum of which no longer shows resonances of allylic hydrogen atoms, is obtained.</p>
    <p>Thereafter, 6.2 g (15.3 mmol) of degassed allyl 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl ether are slowly added and the mixture is stirred at 80° C. for 2 hours. A 1H-NMR spectrum now shows a severely weakened resonance of the Si--H function at 4.6 ppm and an intense resonance at 0.5 ppm, which originates from Si--CH<sub>2</sub> hydrogen atoms.</p>
    <p>3.0 ml of 1-hexene are then added in order to react the remaining excess of Si--H groups, which could otherwise cause crosslinking of the polymer when air later has access. The mixture is further stirred at 80° C. for another half an hour. The reaction mixture is then left to stand overnight. The product is purified over a silica gel column with hexane/ethyl acetate (3:2), the solvent is stripped off and the macromer is dried under a high vacuum. A colourless, clear, viscous product is obtained. The macromer purified in this way is taken up in 20 ml of hexane 20 ml of methylamine (33% in ethanol) are added and the mixture is heated to 40° C. After 10-15 minutes, a white voluminous precipitate separates out. After 30 minutes, the suspension is cooled and filtered and the precipitate is washed with a little hexane. The filtrate is evaporated and the residue is then dried under a high vacuum. Thereafter, the content of amino groups is determined by titrimetry (perchloric acid).</p>
    <p>The resulting macromer is clear and viscous. The amino group content is 78.6% of theory. The total yield of macromer after the chromatographic purification is 75%.</p>
    <p>Preparation of a gluconamide</p>
    <p>17.3 g (corresponding to an amine content of 5.4 meq) of this aminoalkyl-substituted product are dissolved in 20 ml of dried THF. The solution is repeatedly frozen, degassed and let down with argon. All the following operations are carried out in an argon atmosphere. 712 mg of D(+)-gluconic acid d-lactone (4 mmol) are then added. Because of the low solubility of the lactone, a suspension is initially obtained. After stirring overnight at 50° C., the solution is clear and the lactone has been used completely. The stoichiometric remaining amount of D(+)-gluconic acid d-lactone (260 mg, 1.46 mmol) is then added and the mixture is stirred again at 50° C. overnight. A trace of unreacted lactone is observed. Completion of the reaction is monitored by means of thin layer chromatography on silica gel plates with the mobile phase 1-propanol/ethyl acetate/water (6:1:3). The silica gel plates are developed by means of Ce(IV) sulfate/phosphoromolybdic acid solution. Subsequent titration on amino groups yields a residual amino content of &lt;0.1%. After filtration and removal of the solvent by distillation, a highly viscous clear macromer with 0.295 mequivalent of gluconamide per gram of macromer is obtained.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE C-14</heading> <p>Before the polymerization, the acrylates employed, isobutyl acrylate (IBA), N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA) and 3-methacryloyloxypropyl-tris(trimethylsilyloxy)silane (TRIS) are each freed from inhibitors by distillation. 0.32 g (2.76 mmol) of IBA, 0.80 g (8.1 mmol) of DMA and 1 .44 g (3.4 mmol) of TRIS are weighed into a 50 ml round-bottomed flask and the flask is flushed with N2 for half an hour, while cooling with ice. 1.44 g of macromer from Example C-1 are transferred to a round-bottomed flask with a nitrogen attachment, degassed under 3 Pa (0.03 mbar) for 24 hours and then dissolved in 2.7 g of ethanol which has been flushed with N2 for half an hour beforehand. The subsequent preparation of samples and the polymerization are carried out inside a glove box with exclusion of oxygen. The above monomer mixture and the macromer solution from Example C-1 are mixed, with the addition of 0.012 g (0.21 mmol) of Darocur® 1173 and the mixture is subjected to microfiltration (0.45 mm filter). 180 μl of this mixture are introduced into a polypropylene mould, which is then closed with an appropriate lid of polypropylene. The mixture is then irradiated with a UV-A mercury high pressure lamp in a nitrogen atmosphere in a UV oven equipped for this for 5 minutes. The lamps (5 each of the brand TLK40W/10R, Philips) are above and below the holder inserted. The irradiation intensity is 14.5 mW/cm2.</p>
    <p>The polypropylene mould is opened and the finished discs or lenses are removed by soaking by means of a solvent mixture of methylene chloride and ethanol (2:3). The lenses and discs are extracted in ethanol at room temperature in special polypropylene cages for 48 hours and then dried at 40° C. under 10 Pa (0.1 mbar) for 24 hours (autoclaving at 120° C., 30 minutes). The discs show an E modulus of 1.1 MPa, a permeability to oxygen of 183 barrier and a hardness (Shore A) of 53.</p>

    <heading>EXAMPLE D-1</heading> <heading>Macromer Synthesis</heading> <p>In a dry box under nitrogen atmosphere, about 200 grams of dry PDMS dipropoxyethanol (Shin-Etsu) is added to a container. Isocyanatoethyl methacrylate (IEM) in an amount equal to about 2 moles per mole PDMS dialkanol is added to the container. About 0.1 weight percent dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTL) catalyst, based on PDMS dialkanol weight, is added to the container along with a stir bar. The container is immersed in an oil bath atop a stir plate, and secured in place with a clamp. A stream of UPC air at about 2 psig is passed over the mixture. The mixture is agitated at room temperature (about 22° C.) for about 24 hours. An iterative procedure follows in which the mixture is analyzed for isocyanate content and IEM is added if the PDMS dialkoxyalkanol has not been completely reacted. The mixture is stirred about 24 hours more. The macromer produced is a siloxane-containing macromer.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE D-2</heading> <heading>Lens fabrication</heading> <p>A prepolymerization mixture is prepared by mixing about 56 grams of the macromer from Example D-1, about 14 grams of TRIS, about 29 grams N,N -dimethylacrylamide (DMA), about 1 gram methacrylic acid, about 0.5 grams Darocur® 1173 photoinitiator, and about 20 grams hexanol. The mixture is agitated for about 20 minutes at room temperature.</p>
    <p>Next, the mixture is degassed via a series of freezing and thawing steps. The container is placed in a liquid nitrogen bath until the mixture solidifies. A vacuum is applied to the container at a pressure of about 200 millitorr or less for about 5 minutes. Then, the container is placed in a bath of room temperature water until the mixture is liquid again. This process is performed a total of three times.</p>
    <p>The mixture is then polymerized to form contact lenses. The prepolymerization mixture is poured into polypropylene contact lens molds in a nitrogen atmosphere. The polymerization is effected by applying UV radiation (about 4-6 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) for a period of about 15 minutes.</p>
    <p>The resulting fully hydrated contact lens has a water content of about 23%. The lens has a Dk of about 115 barrers and a modulus of elasticity of about 2 MPa</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE D-3</heading> <heading>Lens fabrication</heading> <p>A contact lens is prepared in accordance with the procedure described in Example D-2, with the difference being that the composition is about 50% macromer of Example D-1, about 20% TRIS and about 30% DMA.</p>
    <p>The resulting fully hydrated contact lens has a water content of about 20%. The lens has a Dk of about 118 barrers and a modulus of elasticity of about 1.8 Mpa.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE E-1</heading> <heading>Material A</heading> <p>A contact lens is prepared substantially in accordance with the procedure described in Example A-2.

This degassing procedure is performed a total of three times on the prepolymerization mixture.</p>
    <p>The prepolymer mixture is cured in a nitrogen atmosphere to form the contact lens. The cured lens has an equilibrium water content of about 19%. Subsequent to curing, the lens is plasma treated for about 10 minutes in an atmosphere of methane and air at a 2:1 CH<sub>4</sub> :air volume:volume ratio.

    <p>Subsequent to ion permeability measurements, the lens surface is coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in accordance with the following procedure, using a glass plasma reactor equipped with an external ring electrode and a 27.13 MHz radio frequency (RF) generator for the generation of an inductively-coupled, cold glow discharge plasma.

After reduction of argon plasma gas flow to about 10 sccm, the argon carrier gas flow for the NVP monomer is also set to 10 sccm. The temperature of the NVP source (with the carrier gas bubbling through the liquid NVP) is held at about 40° C. The lenses are treated for about 10 minutes with a pulsing glow discharge plasma (1 μsec. on, 3 μsec. off) at about 0.35 mbar pressure and about 150 Watts power.</p>
    <p>After interrupting the glow discharge and the carrier gas flow, the reactor is continuously purged with a 20 sccm argon steam at a pressure of about 0.009 mbar for about 30 minutes, in order to remove residual monomer and activated species. The PVP coated contact lenses thus produced are highly wettable and show the following dynamic contact angles, measured with a KRUESS (Hamburg, Germany) K-12 instrument:</p>
