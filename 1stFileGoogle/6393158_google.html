At least one segment is associated with a plurality of links to other segments. The method includes playing at least one segment with the temporal flow, determining whether a content expansion is desired prior to reaching the second terminus. If the content expansion is desired, then linking to an expansion segment and playing the expansion segment. If the content expansion is not desired, then linking to a continuing segment and playing the continuing segment. The method includes an additional link from the expansion segment to the continuing segment such that the continuing segment is played after the expansion segment has been played. Other aspects of the invention include other methods for playing stored content, for capturing and playing content, capturing segment and linkage descriptions, storage devices of the segment content, storage mechanisms referencing the continuous media content by segments and linkages and apparatus for capturing and playing continuous media content.</div>

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading> <p>This invention pertains to the storage and interactive playing of segmented continuous play media sequences, and more particularly to digitally stored interactive multimedia content.</p>
    <p>Continuous play media (“multimedia”) can be defined as minimally containing a stream of image or text content forming a perceived continuity when presented to an observer/user. Continuous play media may further contain content streams forming perceived audio continuities when presented to an observer/user. Continuous play media may further contain other content streams including but not limited to closed captioned support for the acoustically impaired or closed captioned presentation of dialogue in one or more alternative languages.</p>
    <p>Image content streams as used herein will include but not be limited to motion video streams as well as streams of text moving with regards to the displayed view available to the user/observer. Programs may generate these image streams, where the displayed view is altered in a manner rendered essentially continuous. Implementation environments for such generating programs include but are not limited to language environments for C, C++, Java, Lingo™ by Macromedia as well as various low level machine independent and/or machine dependent assembly languages. Examples of such implementations include but are not limited to motion picture preambles and postambles, often incorporating still images, textual credits and copyrights often further accompanied by music with a motion background or moving text providing a sense of continuity to the user/observer. Such image content streams may be further accompanied by acoustic effects which augment, and in some cases, establish the sense of continuity experienced by the user/observer.</p>
    <p>Contemporary technology has driven down the cost of storing continuous play media, allowing the recording of large amounts of audio-video content onto a compact disk or DVD disk by a growing number of people, businesses and institutions. Continuously play media recordings and the playing of such recordings began in large numbers with the video tape players and their successors, Video Cassette Recorders (VCRs). Such technologies could record and play one to several hours of television grade audio-video content. The user could control the player to rewind, fast forward, pause, stop and start at a given moment in the recorded presentation. Many of these units could record material, usually received from a television signal, as well as play pre-recorded material. Standard implementations of this technology record or play only one multi-media stream at a time without multiplexing schemes supporting multiple simultaneous streams.</p>
    <p>More recently, digital continuous play media technologies based upon image compression techniques such as QuickTime™ by Apple, MPEG 1, MPEG 2 and DVD have become quite popular. Such technologies are typically used to create a single long playing sequence, such as a motion picture, documentary or training session. User controls for playing such recordings are very similar to earlier controls found on video tape players and VCRs. All of these prior methods of playing and storing continuous play media have a limitation in presenting complex subjects, namely that there presentation is flat, there is no way for the user/observer to alter the stream to delve into a topic as a contiguous part of the stream.</p>
    <p>The Internet and World Wide Web have accelerated the proliferation of hypertext documents. Hypertext possesses highlighted triggers embedded into a viewed document, which when selected, cause the document viewer to display a different view of either the same document or a different document. There is a “back” button on most hypertext viewing systems, which when pushed, causes the view to return to the previous view. These hypertext documents are rapidly creating a new class of interactive documents, allowing a much higher level of complexity to be traversed by readers of greatly varying backgrounds. People may follow many of the hypertext links, or few of the hypertext links depending upon their preferences. However, the approach of hypertext is not continuous play media, it does not create audio-visual streams, but screens of text and pictures primarily, which only move when the user/observer urges them to move. When a hypertext document references a continuous play media file, such as a Quicktime file, it is loaded and played with controls much as a VCR possesses.</p>
    <p>Television, long one of the dominant cultural forces in image content presentation has reached a difficult impasse. Television in the United States is largely supported by revenues from advertising. The Internet threatens such revenues. The reason is that many perceive the Internet as a better basis for advertising because people who are interested in a product can find out what they want to know about the product as they wish to find it out via hyper links. Today's television advertising is constrained to present sound bites of very short duration possessing no ability for the potential customer to direct an inquiry into facts they wish to know. Instead, television today forces repeated transmission of the same limited amount of information, never getting beyond the simplest of messages concerning a product. What is needed is a method by which an advertiser's purchased bandwidth can be more efficiently utilized to permit potential customers to query a larger cross section of information about the products advertised while insuring that the basic product pitch is seen.</p>
    <p>FIG. 1 displays a relevant prior art system comprising an enclosure <b>10</b>, housing a display device <b>12</b>, selector device <b>14</b>, and communication (<b>16</b> and <b>18</b>) between selector device and system plus speakers (<b>20</b>).

Keyboards may house touch pads and mouse sticks which in certain cases are the relevant selector device of that system.</p>
    <p>FIG. 2 displays a block diagram of an exemplary prior art system such as displayed in FIG. <b>1</b>. The units (<b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>36</b> and <b>44</b>) on the left side of this figure all have a major role in the input and output flows processed and controlled by the second column of units (<b>24</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>40</b> and <b>48</b>), respectively. The data transport mechanisms between units (<b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>36</b> and <b>44</b>) and units (<b>24</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>40</b> and <b>48</b>) are represented by arrows (<b>22</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>38</b> and <b>46</b>), respectively. These units interact with each other and an overall control circuit labeled digital processor <b>56</b> via arrows representing buses (<b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> and <b>54</b>). Digital processor <b>56</b> in turn has RAM <b>62</b> and Nonvolatile memory <b>66</b> which it controls and uses to direct the overall operation of relevant prior art systems via buses designated as arrows (<b>58</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>64</b> and <b>68</b>).</p>
    <p>Relevant prior art display devices <b>12</b> may present black and white or color images in either a vector or raster format representing images in either a 2-D, 3-D or multi-dimensional presentation view or collection of views. Relevant display data transport <b>22</b> includes but is not limited to NTSC, PAL or various HDTV television protocols of either analog or digital formats, as well as digital and analog RGB and various flat panel display interface protocols as are often used with computer displays. Many systems today possess a specialized display controller <b>24</b>, which often incorporates one or more temporary frame buffers and MPEG decoding acceleration technology as well as acceleration technology for a variety of graphics operation. The communication mechanism <b>26</b> by which these units interact with the rest of an exemplary prior art system include but are not limited to microcomputer busses such as PCI and AGP as well as dedicated communication paths represented within line <b>52</b>.</p>
    <p>The selector device <b>14</b>, selector device communication mechanism <b>16</b> and selector interface <b>18</b> have been discussed above. The communication between the selector interface <b>18</b> and the rest of the system is denoted by arrow <b>28</b>. Embodiments of arrow <b>28</b> include but are not limited to addressable interfaces on computer busses including but not limited to ISA, PCI and USB.</p>
    <p>Relevant prior art speakers <b>20</b> communicate with audio generator <b>32</b> via arrow <b>30</b>. Arrow <b>30</b> designates communication mechanisms including but not limited to analog signaling or digital signaling. Arrow <b>30</b> communications may be physically transported by wireline technology including but not limited to twisted wire pairs and coaxial cabling, as well as wireless technology including but not limited to short range radio and infra red mechanisms. Audio generator <b>32</b> may perform decoding functions such as translation of encoded MPEG audio streams delivered by arrow <b>34</b> from the overall internal communications network <b>52</b> possibly from the player controller <b>40</b> or external interface <b>48</b> or display controller <b>24</b>. Power amplification of the audio signals may be done either by audio generator <b>32</b>, within the speakers <b>20</b> or involve both. Embodiments of the audio generator interface <b>34</b> to the internal communications network <b>52</b> include but are not limited to addressable interfaces on computer busses including but not limited to ISA, PCI and USB.</p>
    <p>Relevant, prior art content player <b>36</b> communicates with content controller <b>40</b> via arrow <b>38</b>. Content player <b>36</b> embodiments include but are not limited to optical disk players and electromagnetic disk players of either a removable or non-removable media. These content players <b>36</b> embodiments further include but are not limited to CD ROM, MPEG and DVD players.

Relevant prior art communications mechanisms <b>38</b> include but are not limited to various SCSI, RAID, ISA and EISA interfaces.</p>
    <p>Relevant prior art player controllers <b>40</b> often, but not always, partition a continuous play media stream received via <b>38</b> from content player <b>36</b> into an audio stream and a video stream. The audio stream is sent via communication path (arrows <b>42</b> to <b>52</b> to <b>34</b>) to audio generator <b>32</b> to drive speakers <b>20</b>. This communication path may be incorporated into an overall bus protocol, or be a separate signal path, depending upon the specific implementation. The video stream would be sent via communication path (arrows <b>42</b> to <b>52</b> to <b>26</b>) to display controller <b>24</b> to drive display <b>12</b>. The actual decoding of the video stream is often done primarily in display controller <b>24</b>, but in certain instances, digital processor <b>56</b> and player controller <b>40</b> may contribute to the video decoding process. There are also situations in which relevant prior art systems employ display controller <b>24</b> to partition a continuous play media stream into separate one or more audio streams and at least one video stream. Such systems include many set top box architectures.</p>
    <p>Note that in relevant prior art systems, there may be more than one content player <b>36</b> with potentially distinct player controllers <b>40</b> and communication paths <b>38</b>. One content player <b>36</b> might support a writeable CD ROM using a SCSI <b>38</b> based controller <b>40</b> as well as a second DVD-ROM player with its own cabling <b>38</b> and player controller <b>40</b>.</p>
    <p>Another relevant source of continuous play media content is provided via external content <b>44</b> communicating with external interface <b>48</b> via arrow <b>46</b>. One relevant external interface <b>48</b> is a radio frequency (RF) tuner.

Relevant wireless physical transports <b>46</b> include contemporary broadcast television, High Definition TV (HDTV), as well as various radio frequency, microwave and infra red schemes which may well incorporate an antenna, sensor or array of antennas or sensors.</p>
    <p>Another relevant external interface <b>48</b> is a modem. Relevant modems include but are not limited to telephone line modems incorporating various transceiver rates which may not be the same for reception as for transmission, as well as various DSL, ADSL, XDSL, ISBN, Ethernet, Token Ring and ATM interfaces.

Wire line physical transport layers <b>46</b> include but are not limited to telephone lines, twisted pair wire lines, coaxial cabling and various optical fiber technologies. Wireless transport layers <b>46</b> include but are not limited to directional and non-directional radio, microwave, infrared and optical schemes.</p>
    <p>The external content <b>44</b> may be located a substantial distance away from the enclosure <b>10</b>. The external content <b>44</b> is often embodied in many circumstances within a server supporting a network of user systems via interconnections <b>46</b> of these external interfaces <b>48</b>. Such networks may well support TCP/IP thereby enabling support for the Internet. Such networks may further support one or more Intranets. Such networks may further support one or more Extranets.</p>
    <p>Another form of external content <b>44</b> includes video input devices. These often possess external interfaces <b>48</b>, which include video frame capturing circuitry. Such external interfaces <b>48</b> are now including advanced image processing, often further supporting MPEG compatible compression of the captured video stream.</p>
    <p>Note that in many relevant prior art systems, there is more than one kind of external content <b>44</b> and external interface <b>48</b> with potentially different communication paths <b>46</b>. A desktop box might possess both a RF tuner using an antenna as well as an optical fiber interface to a cable television provider. A notebook computer might well have both a telephone line modem and an Ethernet LAN interface.</p>
    <p>Relevant prior art digital processor <b>56</b> embodiments include but are not limited to one or more of the following: general purpose microprocessors, Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), parallel processors, embedded controllers and special purpose system controllers.

    <p>Relevant prior art digital processors <b>56</b> often possess local memory resources in the form of RAM <b>62</b> and nonvolatile memory <b>66</b>, interfaced via busses <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>64</b> and <b>68</b>. The RAM may include but is not limited to various forms of RAM and one or more caching banks of RAM. Relevant prior art digital processor <b>56</b> embodiments may include but are not limited to one or more of memory caches physically proximate to and possibly contained within the digital processor <b>56</b> package or packages. Memory caching may include but is not limited to separate caching of memory and data. Memory caching may further include but is not limited to multiple layers of cache structures. Distinct processors within the digital processor <b>56</b> may further possess distinct caches as well as further localized memory which may in turn include RAM and/or nonvolatile memory. Relevant prior art nonvolatile memory may include but is not limited to boot ROMs and flash memory circuits which may further emulate disk drives with a form of file management system. Such nonvolatile memory <b>66</b> embodiments may be used to initialize the system as well as provide security and accounting information or store content.</p>
    <p>From the user perspective, relevant prior art systems play continuous play media content recordings much as did predecessor VCR systems. They can start at the beginning, or partially through a sequence, and progress forward pausing, stopping and possibly rewinding. Internet access has allowed hypertext-based web sites to provide hot keys supporting the downloading and playing of continuous play media sequences, but again, once downloaded, the continuous play media sequence playing controls are essentially those found on a VCR. Modern television, particularly cable and satellite broadcast television possesses a fairly large number of channels, often over a hundred, to be multiplexed and modulated at the broadcast site and demodulated at the customer/user site into these separate channels. The signal protocols in common use deserve some discussion. These relevant, prior art television channels tend to employ an MPEG continuous play media stream, with an audio stream and a video stream component.</p>
    <p>Consider first what happens in the video stream. MPEG video compression mechanisms utilize an initializing video frame compressed in a manner similar to a still frame, followed by motion compensation data essentially transforming this initial frame into a succession of subsequent motion frames. Every so often, a new initializing frame is sent, followed by motion compensation data again transforming the new initial frame into a new sequence of subsequent motion frames. The compression ratios compared to the raw data are impressive, often a reduction in data size of 200 to 1 can be achieved without noticeable loss of visual clarity. This compression ratio enables this large number of channels to be cost effectively broadcast by satellite and cable television companies.</p>
    <p>Consider what happens when someone changes television channels. The MPEG stream of the new channel is isolated and demodulated from the television broadband transmission into a video stream and an audio stream. The video stream is scanned until the next initializing video frame is encountered. Once encountered, the MPEG video decoder initializes its output stream and motion video frames follow shortly from this initialization frame. These initialization frames occur frequently enough that there is a barely noticeable delay between when one turns to a new channel and the channel's video stream is being displayed. If at this point, the channel is again changed, a short time later there is another initialization video frame observed, the motion frame sequencing begins again. However, there is no mechanism to compensate for or retain whatever has transpired on the original channel. Once these motion frame sequences have passed by, they are gone.</p>
    <p>The audio streams also possess an initialization structure which is asserted from time to time, followed by the time varying incremental audio stream modifications. While the audio and video frames do not necessarily initialize simultaneously, there are synchronization controls between them to facilitate time-aligning them to each other. Taken collectively, there is a certain rationale in considering contemporary continuous play media to be segmented. The block coding used in both transmission and storage of digital continuous play media reinforces the sense of segmentation of continuous play media into short sequences of motion frames (video stream) and the associated audio stream. However, there are no embedded cues within these streams to indicate expansion possibilities or to direct such expansions, or direct the return to provide continuity with the original stream segments.</p>
    <p>What is needed is a method of playing and storing a segmented continuous play media stream which expands and contracts the viewing material based upon the user/observer's and/or system/agent(s)' selections.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>One aspect of the invention is implemented as a method for playing a stored content providing a plurality of segments which collectively contains the stored content. Each of the segments has a first terminus and a second terminus, where the content in each of the segments has a temporal flow from the first terminus to the second terminus. At least one segment is associated with a plurality of links to a corresponding plurality of other segments.</p>
    <p>The method includes playing at least one segment with the temporal flow, determining whether a content expansion is desired prior to reaching the second terminus. If the content expansion is desired, then linking to an expansion segment and playing the expansion segment. If the content expansion is not desired, then linking to a continuing segment and playing the continuing segment. The method includes an additional link from the expansion segment to the continuing segment such that the continuing segment is played after the expansion segment has been played.</p>
    <p>This method is advantageous in providing the user and content provider with a much greater degree of freedom in traversing the content provided. Topics can be expanded upon user request. The individual who wants to know about the gas ant mileage of an automobile shown in a commercial may find out about it, whereas someone interested in the safety features can delve into that while the advertiser is assured that the basic advertising pitch will be presented in a cinematic fashion.</p>
    <p>Another aspect of the invention includes a method for playing a stored content providing a plurality of segments which collectively comprise the stored content. Each of the segments has a first terminus and a second terminus and a continuity link associated with a member of the collection of a segment indicator and a non-segment indicator. Content in each of the segments has a temporal flow from the first terminus to the second terminus. At least one segment is associated with a plurality of expansion links to a corresponding plurality of other of the segments.</p>
    <p>The method of playing includes: Playing the at least one segment with the temporal flow. Determining whether a content expansion is desired prior to reaching the second terminus. If the content expansion is desired, then linking to an expansion segment, pushing the continuity link onto a link stack and playing the expansion segment. If the content expansion is not desired and if the continuity link indicates the continuing segment then linking to a continuing segment and playing the continuing segment.</p>
    <p>This method is advantageous in providing the user and content provider with a much greater degree of freedom in traversing the content provided. Topics can be expanded upon user request. The individual who wants to know about the gas mileage of an automobile shown in a commercial may find out about it, whereas someone interested in the safety features can delve into that while the advertiser is assured that the basic advertising pitch will be presented in a cinematic fashion.</p>
    <p>This method is further advantageous in providing the ability to share an expansion segment or collection of nested expansion segments in more than one segment designating the same expansion segment. Such segments capable of being shared as expansion segments are indicated by continuity segment links indicating a non-segment.</p>
    <p>Another aspect of the invention includes a storage device for a segmented continuous play media stream containing at least three segments. Each segment contains a first terminus and a second terminus. The segmented continuous play media stream within each segment progresses from the first terminus to the second terminus.</p>
    <p>At least one segment of the storage device contains a plurality of links to a corresponding plurality of other segments further comprising a continuation link and at least one expansion link. A cue is associated with each of the expansion links. Each cue may be stored in the containing segment substantially before the segmented continuous play media stream progresses to the second terminus of the containing segment. The segmented continuous play media stream of the containing segment progresses to the first terminus of the corresponding continuation link segment after progress to the containing segment second terminus. The segmented continuous play media stream of the containing segment progresses to the first terminus of the corresponding expansion link segment after progress to the containing segment second terminus.</p>
    <p>Such a storage device is advantageous for providing segmented continuous play media which may by played by the above methods which provide a much greater degree of freedom in traversing the stored content. Topics can be expanded upon user request. The individual who wants to know about the gas mileage of an automobile shown in a commercial may find out about it, whereas someone interested in the safety features can delve into that while the advertiser is assured that the basic advertising pitch will be traversed in a cinematic fashion.</p>
    <p>Another aspect of the invention includes a storage mechanism referencing a continuous play media stream segment store containing a collection of at least three segment descriptors and a collection of at least one expansion link element.</p>
    <p>Each of the segment descriptors of the storage mechanism contains a first terminus, a second terminus and a continuity link. The first terminus referencing a first time point of a continuous play media stream segment contained in the continuous play media stream segment store. The second terminus referencing a second time point of the continuous play media stream segment contained in the continuous play media stream segment store. The continuity link represents one of a collection containing an indicator of another of the segment descriptors and an indicator to a non-segment.</p>
    <p>Each of the expansion link elements of the storage mechanism contains an expansion segment indicator, an expansion cue indicator and an indicator of another of the expansion link elements or of a non-expansion link element. Each of the segment descriptors further contains an indicator of an expansion link element.</p>
    <p>Such a storage mechanism is advantageous for providing segmented continuous play media which may by played by the above methods which provide a much greater degree of freedom in traversing the stored content. Topics can be expanded upon user request. The individual who wants to know about the gas mileage of an automobile shown in a commercial may find out about it, whereas someone interested in the safety features can delve into that while the advertiser is assured that the basic advertising pitch will be traversed in a cinematic fashion.</p>
    <p>Such a storage mechanism is further advantageous in supporting more than one mechanism whereby alternative traversal of a common continuous play media library is provided. One traversal of a television soap opera library may focus on character evolution, whereas another may focus on family relationships and another, on adulterous relationships. Such traversals would reference the common continuous play media library, but establish at least partially divergent expansions.</p>
    <p>Another aspect of the invention includes a method for capturing and playing a continuous content including capturing a plurality of segments, playing at least one stored content segment, determining whether a content expansion is desired, linking to other segments and playing other segments.</p>
    <p>The method includes capturing of at least one continuous play media stream collectively contains the continuous content providing corresponding stored content segments each having a first terminus and a second terminus, where the content has a temporal flow from the first terminus to the second terminus. At least one segment is associated with a plurality of links to a corresponding plurality of the other segments.</p>
    <p>The method further includes playing the stored content segment with temporal flow and determining whether a content expansion is desired prior to reaching the second terminus. If the content expansion is desired then linking to an expansion segment and playing the expansion segment of stored content. If the content expansion is not desired then linking to a continuing segment of stored content and playing the continuing segment of stored content. There is an additional link from the expansion segment of stored content to the continuing segment of stored content such that the continuing segment of stored content is played after the expansion segment of stored content has been played.</p>
    <p>This method advantageously provides for the capturing of a continuous play media stream content and playing of that content. Different users can play and expand the content based upon their individual choices. By way of example, a viewer of a sporting event may chose to expand recent performances of a team or team member, whereas another viewer may chose to examine recent news and interviews with a coach or team manager.</p>
    <p>A further advantage of this method is the ability for selected advertising to gain in depth rather than just repeat or rotate the same prespecified commercial content with no added informational depth on demand. This supports a smarter use of advertising content, providing advertisers with the ability to build up information content, with a kinesthetic interface to expand and examine selected details otherwise unavailable through a media such as television as it is known today.</p>
    <p>Another aspect of the invention includes a method of capturing references to a continuous play media stream segment store including capturing a collection of at least three segment descriptors and capturing a collection of at least one expansion link elements.</p>
    <p>Each of the segment descriptors of the method includes a first terminus, a second terminus and a continuity link. The first terminus references a first time point of a continuous play media stream segment contained in the continuous play media stream segment store. The second terminus references a second time point of the continuous play media stream segment contained in the continuous play media stream segment store. The continuity link represents one of a collection including an indicator of another of the segment descriptors and an indicator to a non-segment.</p>
    <p>Each of the expansion link elements of this method includes an expansion segment indicator, an expansion cue indicator and an indicator of either an indicator of another of the expansion link elements and an indicator of a non-expansion link element. Each of the segment descriptors further includes one of the indicators of one of the expansion link element.</p>
    <p>This method advantageously provides for the capture of references to a continuous play media stream segment store supporting differing expansion services. In a sporting event expansion service: one service may support recent sporting performances, another might incorporate performance statistics and a third might support recent interviews and expert commentary related to specific players or teams.</p>
    <p>Another aspect of the invention includes an apparatus to store and play a continuous play media stream including an external interface circuit, a writeable content store, a digital controller, a display circuit and a selector circuit. The external interface circuit receives at least one continuous play media stream segment. The writeable content store is coupled to the external interface circuit by which the segments of the received continuous play media stream may be transferred and stored. The digital controller is coupled to the external interface circuit and is coupled to the writeable content store. The digital controller further contains a link segment association table. The display circuit is coupled to the digital controller. The display circuit is further coupled to the writeable content store. The selector circuit is coupled to the digital controller sending selector data to the digital controller.</p>
    <p>The digital controller of the apparatus controls the writeable content store and the display circuit to transfer the stored continuous play media stream segment to the display circuit based upon the selector data received by the digital controller and the link segment association table. The digital controller further controls the display circuit to play the transferred continuous play media stream segment by the display circuit based upon the selector data received by the digital controller and the link segment association table.</p>
    <p>The apparatus has the advantage of being able to capture a live stream and perform content expansions without losing the live content. This apparatus provides the necessary architectural capabilities to archive continuous stream segments locally to build a continuous play media store.</p>
    <p>Another advantage of this apparatus is the minimal network overhead to maintain and extend a continuous play media store for an ongoing series of performances such as sporting events, episodes of a television series, news reports and interviews with celebrities and experts.</p>
    <p>A further advantage of this apparatus is the ability for selected advertising to gain in depth rather than just repeat the same commercial content with no added informational depth. This apparatus supports a smarter use of advertising content, providing advertisers with the ability to build up information content on interested users local writeable content store, with a kinesthetic interface to expand and examine selected details otherwise unavailable through a media such as television as it is known today.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p>FIGS. 1 and 2 were discussed with reference to the prior related art. FIG. 3A diagrams a basic temporal flow either expanding or not expanding a segment in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Continuous play media segments <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> can either be played in that order, as indicated by arrow <b>106</b>, or playing continuous play media segment <b>102</b> can be followed by playing continuous play media segment <b>104</b> as indicated by the arrow composed of <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>. Component <b>108</b> indicates that continuous play media segment <b>100</b> is played. Component <b>110</b> indicates that segment <b>102</b> is not played, and that after at most a small amount of time, component <b>112</b> indicates that continuous play media segment <b>104</b> is played. Note that in certain preferred embodiments a transition between playing segment <b>100</b> to playing segment <b>102</b> may be observed by the user/observer. In certain other preferred embodiments, a transition between playing segment <b>102</b> to playing segment <b>104</b> may be observed by the user/observer.</p>
    <p>FIG. 3B schematically depicts the segment links between continuous play media segments of FIG. <b>3</b>A. Continuous play media segment <b>100</b> has two links <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> to other continuous play media segments. Continuous play media segment <b>100</b> contains a continuity link <b>114</b> to the start <b>120</b> of continuous play media segment <b>104</b>. The temporal start of a segment or frame sequence will be denoted as the first terminus and the temporal end of a segment or frame sequence will be denoted as the second terminus hereafter. Continuous play media segment <b>100</b> contains an expansion link <b>116</b> to continuous play media segment <b>102</b>. Continuous play media segment <b>102</b> contains a link <b>118</b> to continuous play media segment <b>104</b>. In certain preferred embodiments of the invention, the link <b>118</b> may be explicitly incorporated in segment <b>102</b>. In certain preferred embodiments, the link <b>118</b> may be implicitly derived from the remembered state of the content player during the playing of segment <b>100</b>. In certain further preferred embodiments of the invention, this implicit derivation may be determined by a stack included in the content player and the indication to do this in certain preferred embodiments is a continuity link not indicating a segment. Segment <b>104</b> further contains a second terminus with a continuity link <b>122</b> in certain preferred embodiments of the invention.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 4A, <b>4</b>B, <b>4</b>C and <b>4</b>D depict moments in a temporal flow as seen by an observer/user in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. FIG. 4A shows a continuous play sequence preceding the point of determining whether an expansion is desired in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Visual cue <b>132</b> is seen against the basic continuous play sequence <b>130</b>. By selecting this cue, the content of the continuous play expansion is chosen. The visual cue in certain preferred embodiments of the invention may be specifically chosen shapes. In certain preferred embodiments, the visual cues may be visually highlighted shapes. In certain preferred embodiments, the visual cues may be essentially stationary upon the viewed display. In certain preferred embodiments of the invention, the visual cues at least occasionally move with respect to the view display.</p>
    <p>FIG. 4B shows the user view of the linking to the continuous play expansion content in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Visual cue <b>132</b> is successively expanded as shown in sequence <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> so that the background <b>138</b> is rendered essentially trivial, if not actually non-existent from the user's perspective. Such a sequence in certain preferred embodiments acts as a transition between the played segment in which the expansion request is determined and the expansion segment which is played in response to the expansion request.</p>
    <p>FIG. 4C shows the user view of the start of the continuous play expansion content in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The expansion content is presented in region <b>140</b> of the display, with a minimal or non-existent background <b>142</b>. In certain preferred embodiments of the invention, the minimal background <b>142</b> is used for presenting limited content messages. In certain further preferred embodiments of the invention, the minimal background <b>142</b> is further used to present advertising or announcements such as broadcast television storm warnings.</p>
    <p>FIG. 4D shows the user view of the continuity segment after determination of whether to play the expansion content in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Item <b>144</b> indicates the basic content of the continuous play media of the continuing segment without the previous expansion cue being presented. Note that if there was no selection of the expansion content during the sequence shown in FIG. 4A, then the sequence shown in FIG. 4D would be what the user would see rather than the material shown in FIGS. 4B and 4C. Note that in certain preferred embodiments of the invention, a transition such as depicted in FIG. 4B displayed as a sequence from <b>140</b> to <b>136</b> to <b>134</b> to <b>132</b> to <b>144</b> can act as a transition from the playing of the desired transition segment to playing the continuing segment as depicted with FIG. <b>4</b>D.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 5A, <b>5</b>B, <b>5</b>C, <b>5</b>D and <b>5</b>E depict moments in a temporal flow as seen by an observer/user in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. FIG. 5A shows the user view of multiple expansion cues <b>152</b> and <b>156</b> further contained in an expansion cue container <b>150</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the invention where expansion cue <b>152</b> is being removed from expansion cue container <b>150</b>. The visual cue container <b>150</b> in certain preferred embodiments of the invention may be specifically chosen shapes. In certain preferred embodiments, the visual cue container <b>150</b> may be visually highlighted shapes. In certain preferred embodiments, the visual cue containers <b>150</b> may be essentially stationary upon the viewed display. In certain preferred embodiments of the invention, the visual cue containers <b>150</b> at least occasionally move with respect to the viewable display. In another preferred embodiment, the motion <b>154</b> is part of the continuous play media stream.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5B shows the user view of multiple expansion cues <b>152</b> and <b>156</b> with expansion cue <b>156</b> contained in an expansion cue container <b>150</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the invention where expansion cue <b>152</b> is further highlighted <b>160</b>. Visual cue <b>152</b> is highlighted as depicted by region <b>160</b>. Arrows <b>158</b> and <b>162</b> denote motion of the visual cue <b>152</b> with respect to the viewable display. Such motions <b>158</b> and <b>162</b> in certain preferred embodiments of the invention may be caused by the user's action. In certain other preferred embodiments, the motion depicted by arrows <b>162</b> and <b>158</b> depict motion partially the result of action by the user <b>158</b> and partially the response of the system <b>162</b>. In certain preferred embodiments of the invention, a visual cue <b>152</b> is only activated for response by removal from a visual cue container <b>150</b>. In certain other preferred embodiments of the invention, visual cues within a visual cue container <b>150</b> become activated for selection when the user selects a visual cue container <b>150</b>. Both motions <b>158</b> and <b>162</b> may be the result of the system responding to a selection regarding the expansion cue <b>152</b>. In another preferred embodiment, the motions <b>158</b> and <b>162</b> are part of the continuous play media stream.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5C shows the user view of multiple expansion cues <b>152</b> and <b>156</b> with expansion cue <b>156</b> contained in an expansion cue container <b>150</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the invention where expansion cue <b>152</b> is further highlighted <b>160</b>. In certain preferred embodiments, a visual cue <b>152</b> when highlighted <b>160</b> may be selected by a user.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5D shows the user view of multiple expansion cues <b>152</b> and <b>156</b> with expansion cue <b>156</b> contained in an expansion cue container <b>150</b> upon selecting expansion cue <b>152</b> and linking to expansion content is shown in sequence <b>162</b> and <b>164</b>. User selection of visual cue <b>152</b> causes the visual cue, in this case, a wallet, to cause a content expansion. This content expansion has a transition sequence depicted by <b>162</b> and <b>164</b>. The wallet is opened in <b>162</b> and then expands in size with <b>164</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5E shows the user view of multiple expansion cues <b>152</b> and <b>156</b> further contained in an expansion cue container <b>150</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the invention where expansion cue <b>152</b> is highlighted <b>160</b> and expansion cue <b>156</b> is removed from expansion cue container <b>150</b> and is further highlighted <b>166</b>. The user moves visual cue <b>156</b> outside the visual cue container <b>150</b> in certain preferred embodiments. Once outside the visual cue container, the visual cue <b>156</b> becomes highlighted <b>166</b>. In certain preferred embodiments of the invention the user can select to activate all the visual cues contained in a visual cue container by a specific selection. In certain preferred embodiments of the invention, the user can select to activate multiple visual cues contained in a visual cue container by a single selection. In certain further preferred embodiments of the invention, the activation of multiple visual cues may be done be selecting some shared property, including but not limited to performance statistics of the members of a sporting team or interviews with experts and stars, by way of example.</p>
    <p>In certain embodiments, the container <b>150</b> is not interactively accessible. Container <b>150</b> in such embodiments may move or be manipulated only as shown in the continuous play media stream. Objects inserted into and/or removed from such containers may be highlighted to indicate possible selection for expansion. By way of example, a person interviewed may pull something from their handbag and it may be highlighted for possible expansion. In certain further preferred embodiments, the user may select the expansion. In other further preferred embodiments, the expansion selection may be automated.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5F depicts various selector device motions which in certain embodiments may serve to select a visual cue without necessitating pushing a button. Selector device <b>170</b> is shown engaged by the user in a variety of different motions not necessarily involving button pushing by which content may be selected in accordance with various embodiments of the invention. Motion <b>172</b> shows a motion in a first direction with a sharp change to a second direction essentially opposing to the first direction in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Motion <b>174</b> shows a back and forth or zig-zag motion in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Motion <b>176</b> shows a motion in a first direction with a sharp change to a second direction essentially opposing to the first direction in accordance with an embodiment of the invention where the first and second directions are essentially opposite of the corresponding directions of the motion <b>172</b>. Motion <b>178</b> shows an essentially oval or circular motion in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Note that these motions have been shown as essentially planar for the purposes of illustration alone. The portrayed motions may further be seen as curves in three dimensions in accordance with other preferred embodiments of the invention. The specifics of which motions have been portrayed are not meant to limit the invention to these specific selector motions, but instead indicate that user selection may be achieved in certain preferred embodiments of the invention without the necessity of pushing one or more buttons.</p>
    <p>FIG. 6 is a flowchart of a method of playing segmented continuous play media content in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Operation <b>180</b> designates starting the method, which in certain preferred embodiments of the invention may include but is not limited to allocating system resources.</p>
    <p>Arrow <b>182</b> designates an iterative point in the method leading to the execution of operation <b>184</b>. Operation <b>184</b> designates playing a content having a temporal flow, starting at one point in time and progressing to a later point in time, a segment of continuous play media. Operation <b>186</b> designates determining whether additional content has been indicated. Arrow <b>188</b> is followed when additional content has not been indicated, leading to execution of operation <b>190</b>. Operation <b>190</b> designates playing the continuing content having the temporal flow without appreciable delay. In certain preferred embodiments of the invention, this entails a recursive execution of the operations starting at <b>180</b>. Arrow <b>192</b> leads to the execution of operation <b>194</b>, which determines if this method is done. If operation <b>194</b> determines that the method is not done, arrow <b>196</b> direct the execution to arrow <b>182</b>, which in turn leads to execution of operation <b>184</b> as discussed above. If operation <b>194</b> determines that the operations are done, arrow <b>198</b> leads to the end, where any necessary housekeeping type functions such as closing files, releasing allocated system resources, and the like may be performed to end the operations.</p>
    <p>If operation <b>186</b> determines that additional expansion content should be played, arrow <b>200</b> directs execution to operation <b>202</b>. Operation <b>202</b> designates playing expansion content having the temporal flow without appreciable delay. In certain preferred embodiments of the invention, this entails a recursive execution of the operations starting at <b>180</b>. Arrow <b>204</b> directs execution to arrow <b>188</b>, which directs execution to operation <b>190</b>, which plays continuing content having the temporal flow without appreciable delay. In certain preferred embodiments of the invention, this entails a recursive execution of the operations starting at <b>180</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 7A architecturally depicts part of a user interface for a continuous play media segment expansion in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The direction of temporal flow is indicated by arrow <b>212</b>. A preceding segment <b>210</b> and a succeeding segment <b>224</b> are shown by way of example. The discussion will focus on seamless expansion within segment <b>214</b>. Note that by way of example, the segment <b>214</b> is shown as a single contiguous segment within which expansion decision points <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, <b>220</b> and <b>222</b> occur. In certain preferred embodiments of the invention, each of these decision points is at the ending terminus of the segment it is in and the beginning terminus of the continuing segment. In certain alternative preferred embodiments, a single segment <b>214</b> can possess multiple expansion decision points <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, <b>220</b> and <b>222</b> successively located before or at the second terminus of the segment <b>214</b>.</p>
    <p>Note further that FIG. 7A shows expansion links <b>228</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>238</b> and <b>242</b> respectively pointing to termini <b>226</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>254</b> and <b>256</b>, which all share a common segment <b>250</b> and possess a common second terminus <b>246</b>.</p>
    <p>In certain preffered embodiments of the invention, terminus <b>252</b> acts as the second terminus of a segment with first terminus <b>226</b>, as well as terminus <b>252</b> acting as the first terminus for a segment with second terminus <b>254</b>. Terminus <b>254</b> can further act as the first terminus of a segment with second terminus <b>256</b>. Terminus <b>256</b> can act as the first terminus of a segment with second terminus <b>246</b>. In certain alternative embodiments of the invention there are multiple expansion points <b>226</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>254</b> and <b>256</b> successively arranged between the first terminus <b>226</b> and second terminus <b>246</b> of the segment.</p>
    <p>In certain situations, there may be many expansion links within a relatively short frame sequence. Such situations may be implemented as an additional kind of expansion link, possessing multiple decision points where expansion to other segments may be performed. These decisions may be as frequent as once per frame in certain embodiments. The referenced expansion segments may vary for each expansion decision point in certain further preferred embodiments. The first and/or second terminus of these referenced expansion segments may vary linearly with the frame and/or temporal distance from the starting expansion decision point in certain further preferred embodiments. In certain preferred embodiments, one or both of the termini may grow earlier or later temporally with regards to the continuous play content.</p>
    <p>FIG. 7B architecturally depicts part of a user interface for a different continuous play media segment expansion in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The direction of temporal flow is indicated by arrow <b>212</b>. A preceding segment <b>210</b> and a succeeding segment <b>224</b> are shown by way of example. The discussion will focus on seamless expansion within segment <b>214</b>. Note that by way of example, the segment <b>214</b> is shown as a single contiguous segment within which expansion decision points <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, <b>220</b> and <b>222</b> occur. In certain preferred embodiments of the invention, each of these decision points is at the ending terminus of the segment it is in and the beginning terminus of the continuing segment. In certain other preferred embodiments, a single segment <b>214</b> can alternatively possess multiple expansion decision points <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, <b>220</b> and <b>222</b> successively located before or at the second terminus of the segment <b>214</b>.</p>
    <p>Note further that FIG. 7B shows expansion links <b>228</b>, <b>230</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>238</b> and <b>242</b> respectively pointing to termini <b>226</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>254</b> and <b>256</b>, which all share a common segment <b>250</b> and possess a common second terminus <b>246</b>. Note that expansion decision point <b>218</b> possesses two expansion links <b>230</b> and <b>236</b>, expansion point <b>220</b> possesses two expansion links <b>232</b> and <b>238</b> and expansion point <b>222</b> possesses two expansion links <b>234</b> and <b>242</b>.</p>
    <p>In certain preferred embodiments of the invention, terminus <b>252</b> acts as the second terminus of a segment with first terminus <b>226</b>, as well as terminus <b>252</b> acting as the first terminus for a segment with second terminus <b>254</b>. Terminus <b>254</b> can further act as the first terminus of a segment with second terminus <b>256</b>. Terminus <b>256</b> can act as the first terminus of a segment with second terminus <b>246</b>. In certain alternative embodiments of the invention there are multiple expansion points <b>226</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>254</b> and <b>256</b> successively arranged between the first terminus <b>226</b> and second terminus <b>246</b> of the segment.</p>
    <p>FIG. 8A depicts segment expansion utilizing a landing sub-segment in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Segment <b>260</b> possesses expansion link <b>266</b> to the first terminus of segment <b>268</b>. The continuity link from segment <b>262</b> goes to the first terminus <b>264</b> of segment <b>274</b>. The continuation link after segment <b>268</b> goes not to segment <b>274</b>'s first terminus <b>264</b>, but to landing offset <b>272</b> temporally located after first terminus <b>264</b>. Several methods in accordance with various preferred embodiments of the invention supporting such situations will be discussed later in this document.</p>
    <p>FIG. 8B depicts multiple expansion segments in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Segment <b>276</b> at its second terminus possesses continuity link <b>278</b> and expansion links <b>280</b> and <b>282</b>. Expansion link <b>280</b> directs various embodiment of the invention to play segment <b>284</b>. Expansion link <b>282</b> directs various embodiment of the invention to play segment <b>286</b>. Premature contraction point <b>277</b> is temporally located after the first terminus of segment <b>276</b> and before the second terminus of segment <b>276</b>. Premature contraction point <b>277</b> has two links <b>294</b> and <b>296</b>. The user can select link <b>294</b>, which acts to skip the content between contraction point <b>277</b> and the second terminus of segment <b>276</b>, thus triggering the determination of whether to expand segment <b>284</b> or expand segment <b>286</b> or continue to segment <b>292</b>. The user can select link <b>296</b>, which acts to skip the content between contraction point <b>277</b> and the second terminus of <b>276</b> and continue playing segment <b>292</b>.</p>
    <p>The user choices in certain preferred embodiments may be automated to be performed under the user's direction, which may be further given at a substantially earlier time. An alternative preferred embodiment of the invention automates the expansion selection mechanism at the behest of the editor or producer of the content. A further preferred embodiment of the invention automates the expansion mechanism based upon system knowledge of the user. By way example, expansion content for a seven year girl may be substantially different than expansion content for a forty five year old architect.</p>
    <p>The second terminus of segment <b>284</b> directs playing to continue at the first terminus of segment <b>292</b>. Note that continuing to play at segment <b>292</b> can be caused by either an explicit reference to segment <b>292</b> or by use of a link stack and a continuity link for segment <b>284</b> indicating a non-segment as discussed with FIGS. 10 to <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p>The second terminus of segment <b>286</b> directs playing to continue at the first terminus of segment <b>292</b> via link <b>288</b>. Premature contraction point <b>287</b> is temporally located after the first terminus of segment <b>286</b> and before the second terminus of segment <b>286</b>. Premature contraction point <b>287</b> has one link <b>298</b>. The user can select link <b>298</b>, which acts to skip the content between contraction point <b>287</b> and the second terminus of segment <b>286</b>, and continue playing segment <b>292</b>. Note that continuing to play at segment <b>292</b> can be caused by either an explicit reference to segment <b>292</b> or by use of a link stack and a continuity link for segment <b>286</b> indicating a non-segment as discussed with FIGS. 10 to <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 8C depicts an annotation chart shown for use in designing a continuous play expansion segment system in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. One of the first stages in making an expansion segment content is the acquisition of continuous media stream components. As was previously discussed, MPEG streams can be addressed down to specific frames in a temporal sequence. It is to be noted that raw video streams may be digitally captured and are also addressable down to individual frames. This FIG. depicts the stage in the creation process when the designer has captured frame sequences <b>300</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>322</b>, <b>324</b>, <b>326</b>, <b>328</b> and <b>330</b>. The figure represents one conceptual model of an annotation system where the scope, content and duration of the frame sequences can be viewed in preparation for creating the links associated with the completed expansion media product. Note that the specific frame sequences <b>300</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>322</b>, <b>324</b>, <b>326</b>, <b>328</b> and <b>330</b> may be modified over time by the edit process of which this chart is but one component.</p>
    <p>In certain preferred embodiments of the invention, this chart uses a notation in which number of timing relation relationships can be derived. Two frame sequences may be temporally abutting, such as sequence <b>322</b> and sequence <b>324</b>, where the second terminus of frame sequence <b>322</b> and the first terminus of sequence <b>324</b> are essentially temporally adjacent to each other. Frame sequences <b>326</b> and <b>328</b> display a temporal gap, where the second terminus of frame sequence <b>326</b> occurs a perceptible time before the first terminus of frame sequence <b>328</b> occurs.</p>
    <p>Frame sequence <b>320</b> is nested within frame sequence <b>300</b>, where the first terminus of frame sequence <b>300</b> occurs at the same time or before the first terminus of <b>320</b>, and the second terminus of frame sequence <b>320</b> occurs at the same time or before the second terminus of frame sequence <b>300</b>. Frame sequences <b>322</b> and <b>326</b> share simultaneous starting times, where each frame sequence's first terminus occurs at essentially the same time. Frame sequences <b>328</b> and <b>330</b> share simultaneous ending times, where each frame sequence's second terminus occurs at essentially the same time.</p>
    <p>Frame sequences <b>324</b> and <b>328</b> overlap, where the first terminus of the first frame sequence <b>324</b> occurs before the first terminus of the second frame sequence <b>328</b> and the second terminus of the second frame sequence <b>328</b> occurs after the second terminus of the first frame sequence <b>324</b>.</p>
    <p>Frame sequence <b>320</b> spans frames sequences <b>322</b> and <b>324</b>, in that the first terminus of frame sequence <b>320</b> occurs before the second terminus of frame sequence <b>322</b> and the second terminus of frame sequence <b>320</b> occurs after the first terminus of frame sequence <b>324</b>. Another example of spanning frame sequences <b>322</b> and <b>324</b> could also include a segment starting at <b>306</b> and ending at <b>310</b> in certain preferred embodiments of the invention. Such a segment would have a first terminus <b>306</b> occurring before the second terminus of frame sequence <b>322</b> and the second terminus of frame sequence, <b>310</b> occurs after the first terminus of frame sequence <b>324</b>.</p>
    <p>In certain preferred embodiments of the invention, the end product of the segmentation design process is presentation upon a broadcast media, where bandwidth and local user content storage constraints may necessitate organizing priorities for transmission and storage of the edited content. To this end and by way of example, consider the following additional structural elements where the frame sequences are organized into horizontal rows for certain further preferred embodiments of the invention.</p>
    <p>Frame sequence <b>300</b> is the top level of the presentation. This is the basic material, which the designer wishes the users/observers to traverse. In a documentary setting, this is the basic information. In a fictional setting, such as a soap opera, drama or comedy, this is the basic episodic presentation. In an advertising setting, this is the basic pitch material, often limited to 20 to 30 seconds in duration, which is currently transmitted repetitiously many times with no additional content. In sports settings, this is the athletic event with commercials and intermission events, which possess no ability for the users/observers to focus the presentation upon their specific interests. This is the entirety of what can be presented today.</p>
    <p>The second horizontal layer contains a single frame sequence <b>320</b>. Note that at this stage in the editing process, no segment linkages have been determined, so that while the material of <b>320</b> is continuous, it may be subsequently partitioned into more than one segment. In other circumstances, frame sequence <b>320</b> may be provided with premature contraction points. Segmentation and premature contraction points can be advantageously placed in an advertising setting within say the sporting event presentation to allow the users to return to the sporting event when the action on the field resumes, by way of example. Note that in certain preferred embodiments, the second row may represent the preceding episode of a fictional, historical or documentary series. In certain other preferred embodiments, the second row might be the second highest priority information documenting a product or service in an advertisement.</p>
    <p>The third horizontal layer contains frame sequences <b>322</b> and <b>324</b>. In certain circumstances, these frame sequences may represent frame sequences from a previous episode which remain relevant, for instance, where the advertisers have stopped supporting a series, the removed frame sequences may be their previous advertisements. In certain other preferred embodiments, the content of the previous episode may have been rendered irrelevant by subsequent events and therefore no longer relevant to be stored. In certain other preferred embodiments of the invention, each layer has lower priority for transmission and/or storage, so that in various embodiments, the content of a layer may either be given a lower bandwidth budget or local user storage budget. Many of the compression technologies in use and under development support what is known as progressive encoding, which permits the allocation of varying amounts of bandwidth and/or storage for specific segments, or in the case, layers of segments.</p>
    <p>The fourth horizontal layer contains frame sequences <b>326</b> and <b>328</b>. In certain circumstances, these frame sequences may represent frame sequences from a previous episode which remain relevant, for instance, where the advertisers have stopped supporting a series, the removed frame sequences may be their previous advertisements. In certain other preferred embodiments, the content of the previous episode may have been rendered irrelevant by subsequent events and therefore no longer relevant to be stored.</p>
    <p>The fifth horizontal layer includes one frame sequence <b>330</b>. This may represent an archival frame sequence where the primary characters were introduced in certain preferred embodiments of the invention. This may also an archival frame sequence where the current dominant plot in a soap opera was introduced in certain preferred embodiments of the invention. In certain other preferred embodiments of the invention, this may represent an overview to an advertiser's product line.</p>
    <p>In certain alternative preferred embodiments of the invention, continuous play stream <b>300</b> is the “raw” continuous play stream, such the footage of interview, athletic event, or soap opera, by way of example. Segments <b>320</b>, <b>322</b>, <b>324</b>, <b>326</b>, <b>328</b> and <b>330</b> all reference the same raw footage. Segment <b>320</b> is a subsequence of sequence <b>300</b>, where the person being interviewed may discuss a specific handbag that they own. In sequence <b>322</b>, the subject is showing their wallet. In sequence <b>326</b>, the subject discusses how they acquired the wallet. In sequence <b>324</b>, the subject demonstrates one of the contents of the handbag, such as a concert ticket. In sequence <b>328</b>, the subject tells a story inspired by one of the contents of the handbag, such as the concert ticket discussed in sequence <b>324</b>. In sequence <b>330</b>, subject sings a song from the concert as told in sequence <b>328</b>. It should be noted that other annotations could be derived by other editors.</p>
    <p>The storage of the “raw” content need only be done once. The segment descriptions represent a very amount of data compared to the continuous play streams they reference. One second of MPEG 2 audio-video content is typically between one half to one megabyte. Each segment referencing that content would typically take less than a few hundred bytes in many preferred embodiments of the invention and might well reference many seconds of content. The separation of segment description tables from the storage of continuous play content is thus advantageous in certain preferred embodiment of the invention. The segment description tables may thus be supplied separately from the “raw” continuous play media stream in certain other preferred embodiments.</p>
    <p>FIG. 9A depicts components included in a description <b>340</b> of a segment in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. A segment description <b>340</b> includes but is not limited to a segment identifier <b>342</b>, first terminus <b>344</b>, second terminus <b>346</b>, continuity link <b>348</b> and expansion link pointer <b>350</b>. A segment identifier <b>342</b> in certain preferred embodiments is a number, an address within the addressing system, a file name in a file management system such as a disk drive or an offset into a stream recording system. A first terminus <b>344</b> represents the start of the displayable content of the segment in certain preferred embodiments of the invention. A second terminus <b>346</b> represents the end of the displayable content of the segment in certain preferred embodiments of the invention. A continuity link <b>348</b> direct the various methods of playing a successor segment when playing the current segment is completed and no segment expansion is requested. An expansion link pointer <b>350</b> points to an expansion link description as discussed hereafter.</p>
    <p>FIG. 9B depicts components included in a description of an expansion link <b>462</b>. In certain preferred embodiments, an expansion link description <b>462</b> includes but is not limited to an expansion segment identifier <b>352</b> and an expansion link pointer <b>356</b>. In certain further preferred embodiments, an expansion link description <b>462</b> further includes but is not limited to a cue definition <b>354</b>. In certain further preferred embodiments, an expansion link description <b>462</b> further includes but is not limited to a continuity link offset <b>358</b>. An expansion segment identifier <b>352</b> in certain preferred embodiments is a number, an address within the addressing system, a file name in a file management system such as a disk drive or an offset into a stream recording system. Expansion link pointer <b>356</b> either points to another expansion link description or else indicates that there is no expansion link description.</p>
    <p>A cue definition in certain preferred embodiment of the invention defines how an expansion link is selected. In certain further preferred embodiments of the invention, the cue definition further defines a discernible entity displayed within the segment, which may be selected to indicate selection of the associated expansion link. In certain further preferred embodiments of the invention, the cue definition may further indicate highlighting the discernible entity.</p>
    <p>FIG. 9C depicts a collection <b>420</b> of segment descriptions, a collection <b>460</b> of expansion links and a continuous play content store <b>470</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.

Continuous play content store <b>470</b> in certain preferred embodiments of the invention includes at least three segments of continuous play streams.</p>
    <p>FIG. 10 is a flowchart depicting playing one or more continuous play segments in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Start <b>500</b> may operate upon the systems resources, causing at least temporary allocation of the system resources needed for the operation of this method. Arrow <b>502</b> directs execution to operation <b>504</b>, which fetches a segment descriptor.</p>
    <p>Arrow <b>506</b> directs execution to operation <b>508</b>. Operation <b>508</b> performs beginning fetch of multimedia segment, fetching expansion link list (<b>510</b>), playing multimedia segment and optionally highlighting expansion cue. In certain preferred embodiments, beginning fetch of multimedia segment entails initiating an access to a multimedia store. Once such an initiation has begun, the data will be transferred by the access of the multimedia store for an extended length of time. In certain preferred embodiments of the invention, the fetching of the expansion link list occurs concurrently with the beginning of fetching the multimedia segment. In certain preferred embodiments, once the fetching of the multimedia segment has begun, playing the multimedia segment starts. In certain preferred embodiments of the invention optional highlighting of expansion cues starts when the fetch of multimedia segment has begun and the fetching of the expansion link list is completed and the playing of the multimedia segment starts.</p>
    <p>Operation <b>508</b> further plays a multimedia segment, highlighting optional expansion cues. Note that expansion cues may include but are not limited to a user numerically selecting the player number and team in a team sport in certain preferred embodiments. In certain other preferred embodiments a user may select a discernible entity. In certain further preferred embodiments, the display may highlight one or more of the discernible entity cues.</p>
    <p>Arrow <b>516</b> directs execution to start operation <b>518</b>, which determines whether an expansion cue has been selected. Note that arrow <b>516</b> must do this before operation <b>508</b> has completed playing the current continuous play segment in certain preferred embodiments of the invention. In certain further preferred embodiments of the invention, the arrow <b>516</b> schedules operation <b>518</b> at least a predetermined time interval before the completion of playing the multimedia segment.</p>
    <p>If an expansion cue has not been selected, arrow <b>520</b> directs execution to operation <b>522</b>, which determines whether the continuity link of the segment indicates a non-segment. If the continuity link indicates a segment, the current segment is set to the continuity link segment by operation <b>532</b> and execution is directed by arrows <b>530</b> and <b>502</b> to operation <b>504</b>, which fetches the segment descriptor and iterating the operations described above. If the continuity link indicates a non-segment execution is directed to operation <b>524</b>, which determines if the link stack is empty. If the link stack is empty, execution is directed to operation <b>526</b>, halting the playing of the multimedia segment at the second terminus of the segment. If the link stack is not empty, execution is directed to operation <b>528</b> which determines if the link stack has been fully processed. Operation <b>528</b> will be described in detail in the discussion of FIG. 12 below. If operation <b>528</b> determines that the link stack has been fully processed, execution is directed to halt the playing of the multimedia segment at the second terminus. If operation <b>528</b> determines that the link stack has not been fully processed, execution is directed by arrows <b>530</b> and <b>502</b> to iterate the above described operations starting at operation <b>504</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 11 is a flowchart depicting fetching an expansion link list used as operation <b>510</b> as part of operation <b>508</b> in FIG. 10 in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Execution begins with the initialization of LINK_PTR=SEGMENT.EXPANSION_LINK_PTR. This is a symbolic notation having a comparable meaning in many computer programming languages, where the current segment description incorporates an expansion link pointer, which is used to initialize a variable which will be used to traverse the expansion link list associated with this segment. Arrow <b>542</b> directs execution to operation <b>544</b>, which determines whether LINK_PTR is not the null link pointer. If LINK_PTR is the null link pointer, execution is directed to exit this flowchart and return to the other tasks to be done in operation <b>508</b>. Operations <b>548</b> fetches the expansion link at LINK_PTR to THIS_LINK, which in certain preferred embodiments of the invention is a memory buffer. The memory buffer THIS_LINK is then loaded into the expansion link table for the segment in certain preferred embodiments of the invention. Operation <b>552</b> then sets LINK_PTR to the EXPANSION_LINK_POINTER component of the expansion link description. Arrow <b>554</b> then directs execution to arrow <b>542</b> to repeat the operations described above starting with operation <b>544</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 12 is a flowchart depicting operation <b>528</b>, which determines whether the link stack has been fully processed in FIG. 10 in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Arrow <b>560</b> directs execution to operation <b>562</b>, which determines if the top of the link stack is a non-segment.</p>
    <p>If the top of the link stack is a segment, execution is directed to operation <b>564</b> which pops the link stack segment into segment, which is the next segment to be played. Execution is then directed to operation <b>572</b>, which returns a NO.</p>
    <p>If the top of the link stack is not a segment, execution is directed to operation <b>566</b>, which removes the top of the link stack. Execution is then directed to operation <b>568</b>, which determines if the link stack is non-empty. If the link stack is empty, execution is directed to operation <b>574</b>, which returns YES. If the link stack is not empty, arrows <b>570</b> and <b>560</b> direct execution to operation <b>562</b> iterating upon the operations described above.</p>
