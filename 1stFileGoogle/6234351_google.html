As the interply region inflates, an inner ply rises and becomes an advancing wall, raising the bulk material level in the bag, inclining the bottom of the bag, and pulling excess material away from the drain port all at the same time. In another embodiment, the pillow bag is made with half the initial number of layers folded in half to create the upper and lower plies and the non-fold edges are bonded. Where corner drain ports are used, the bag can be arranged so that an interlayer bond parallel to the fold is parallel to a diagonal of a tote in which the bag sits and so that the interlayer bond is opposite the drain port to enhance bag evacuation. An additional optional feature of the invention is the inclusion of an integral filling conduit or snout on the top of the bag, a mouth of which acts as a fill port to ease filling of the bag. The invention can also be applied to fitted bags.</div>

    <p>This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 60/072,815 and 60/072,816, both filed on Jan. 28, 1998, which provisional applications are incorporated by reference herein.</p>
    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading> <p>The invention relates to bags used for shipping bulk materials such as granular materials, powders, liquids, pastes, and other flowable and semi-flowable bulk materials. Specifically, the invention relates to devices and arrangements for evacuating the bags.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>In the bulk material shipping industry, where plastic bags in totes, such as plastic totes, are used to ship quantities of liquids, pastes, granular materials, powders, and other flowable and semi-flowable bulk materials, substantial quantities of the bulk material can be left in the bag when the bag has been nearly completely evacuated. This is true even where pumps are connected to the drain ports of the bags, and is especially true of more flow-resistant bulk materials, such as drywall paste and mayonnaise. This problem with bulk material shipper bags is created when the bag is evacuated and collapses, which leaves folds of bag material in the tote. When the excess folds are on the bottom near the drain, they can be sucked against the drain port, stalling the pump.</p>
    <p>To reduce the amount of bulk material wasted by being left in the bag, prior inventors have tried several approaches. One approach is to incline the bottom of the bag toward the drain port by tilting part or all of the base of the shipping container or even tilting the entire shipping container, plastic tote and all. This approach can be complicated and inefficient since it requires mechanical apparatus to tilt the container if it is not done manually. Additionally, since this approach does little, if anything, to hold the bag in place within the rigid container, the bag can slide when the bottom of the container is tilted. The sliding bag can block the drain port, which prevents removal of further bulk material from the bag and can cause pump stalling.</p>
    <p>Another approach is to use a special structure in the bag or in the rigid container to squeeze the residual contents out of the bag. In the case of special structures in the bag, one arrangement stiffens the bag near the drain port using battens or other stiffeners that add to the cost of the bag. Another arrangement adds a special chamber to the bag that can be filled with pressurized air to squeeze the contents from the primary chamber. This arrangement requires the addition of material to the bag solely for the purpose of squeezing the contents of the primary chamber, which increases cost and complexity of manufacture and is inelegant. Additionally, there is no way to prevent pump stalling by excess folds of bag material from blocking the drain port at low bulk material levels. Squeezing the bulk material from the bag in this manner also requires relatively high pressure. To resist the high pressure, reinforced bag material or external pressure-resistant containers must be used that are more expensive than conventional bags and containers.</p>
    <p>In the case of special structures in the rigid container, prior inventors have used piston arrangements, rollers, and other external squeezing arrangements. A more passive special rigid container is the pressure-resistant container discussed above. These clearly add significant cost and complexity to the rigid container. Though blockage of the drain port by excess bag material is not as prevalent in these arrangements as it is in arrangements using inflatable chambers, neither is there a way to prevent such blockage.</p>
    <p>Another technique for reducing blockage of the drain port is to leave the plunging arrow used to puncture the shipper bag through the drain port extended into the bag. When the bag is evacuated, the plunging arrow presents itself as an obstacle to blockage of the drain port. This delays or reduces the amount of blockage, but a significant amount of bulk material is still left in the bag.</p>
    <p>Another prior art device, known as an antivacuum device, can be attached to the drain port to reduce and/or delay blockage of the drain port. The antivacuum device is a cylinder that extends into the bag interior from the drain fitment. A plurality of holes are cut in the sides of the cylinder so that bulk material can flow through the holes if the main opening of the cylinder is blocked by folds of bag material. While this does reduce or delay blockage of the drain port and the amount of wasted bulk material, a significant amount of bulk material is left behind. Additionally, the antivacuum device undesirably increases the cost and complexity of bag manufacture.</p>
    <p>A disadvantage of all prior attempts to enhance evacuation of shipper bags and reduce wasted bulk material is that they generally require human intervention during evacuation. Prior arrangements cannot simply be hooked up and allowed to operate until all bulk material that can be has been evacuated. Rather, a human attendant must do something during evacuation to initiate the evacuation enhancement.</p>
    <p>With the disadvantages of the prior art, there is a need for a simple, inexpensive, and elegant way to enhance shipper bag evacuation. There is also a need for a liquid shipper arrangement that avoids or at least significantly delays sucking of excess bag material against the drain port of the bag. An enhanced-evacuation shipper bag that does not require human intervention during evacuation is also needed.</p>
    <p>An additional problem with pillow-type shipper bags is that they generally lack a filling conduit or snout that would enhance ease of filling the bags. Typically, pillow bags include fitments in their tops for filling the bags through fill hoses that can be connected to the fitments. This arrangement is meant for users who can pump bulk material into the bag through the fill hoses. However, many users either do not want or cannot pump their bulk material and instead pour their bulk material into bags, such as open-top pillow bags and fitted bags equipped with snouts. Open-top pillow bags tend to be more difficult to close than snout-equipped fitted bags and are more susceptible to contamination, but snout-equipped fitted bags are more expensive than open-top pillow bags. In addition, prior attempts to incorporate snouts into pillow-type bags have failed for one reason or another. Consequently, there is a need for a new pillow-type bag that solves the problems associated with shipper bag evacuation as enumerated above and that includes a snout for easy filling of the bag.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>My invention takes advantage of existing shipper bag construction to provide an inflatable chamber that enhances evacuation of shipper bag contents without requiring human intervention during evacuation. In one embodiment, I add an air input port and conduit to the lower half of a pillow bag and opposite the drain port. The input port allows inflation of an interply region between two lower plies of the pillow bag using low pressure air. The air input conduit is preferably connected to a source of pressurized air at the outset of evacuation. The interply region inflates as the bulk material is removed from the bag through the drain port. As the interply region inflates, the inner ply or plies rise near the air input port so that the part beneath the bag contents in that area effectively lifts the fluid and becomes an advancing wall. Unlike prior arrangements, however, the advancing wall doesn't squeeze the bag contents out the drain port. Rather, the advancing wall simply inclines the bottom of the bag a little at a time and raises the level of the bag contents so that the drain port is always completely covered by bulk material. Because the level of the contents is kept above the drain port until very near the end of evacuation, folds of material that collect as the bag collapses float or ride on the surface of the bulk material and do not block the drain port. Additionally, the inner ply is kept taut at all times by the air pressure, pulling the bag material away from the drain port and further preventing or at least significantly delaying drain port blockage. The combination of the drain port and the plumped interply region also holds the bag in place so that it does not slide around in the container if the container is moved.</p>
    <p>In another embodiment, I slightly modify the construction of a pillow bag to enhance the performance of the inflatable chamber. Here I use half the initial number of layers of material as in conventional pillow bags, fold them in half to form the upper and lower plies, and bond the non-fold edges of the plies. Depending on particular needs, I can leave the fold unbonded, bond all plies together very near the fold, bond the layers on the fold, or bond one set of plies parallel to the fold at an advantageous location. This adds little to the cost and complexity of manufacture, yet can greatly improve performance of my invention. To enhance performance of this embodiment when it includes a corner drain port, I rotate the bag 45° relative to the tote upon insertion of the bag in the tote so that the bond defining the interply regions is parallel to a diagonal of the tote.</p>
    <p>An additional optional feature of my invention is the incorporation of an integral filling conduit, which I prefer to call a snout, into evacuation-enhancing pillow-type bags. I have found a way to include a snout on such pillow bags without significantly increasing cost or difficulty of manufacture. When used in my inflatable, evacuation-enhancing pillow bag, I prefer to form seals between the plies of the bag: one along the side(s) of the bag opposite the drain port and one along the side(s) including (and nearest to) the drain port. The seal opposite the drain port is preferably formed at a point on the side of the bag below the snout. The amount of bag material leading to the drain on either side of the seal is preferably substantially equal, though the exact position can vary depending on the particular application. The other seal is at the midpoint of the bag. The air input port is formed just below the seal opposite the drain. The result of this configuration is a minimization of bulk material left in the bag when no more bulk material can be discharged, significantly increasing the amount of bulk material evacuated from the bag, thus saving the user bulk material, time, and money. I take two or more rectangular layers of material and bond their edges into a shape that will yield a bag with a snout, such as a rectangle with the long base of a trapezoid on one side. Flaps of material are left next to the sides of the trapezoid, and I cut these off to facilitate handling and filling of the bag. Alternatively, I can use one or more rectangular layers of material folded in half, then bond their edges along the sides to form the same trapezoid/rectangle shape. In this alternative, the fold lies on the side of the rectangle opposite the long base of the trapezoid and may not need to be sealed, depending on the particular application and the desires of the user. A drain can be included in one side of either variation of the bag to allow discharge of the bag's contents.</p>
    <p>With the sides of the evacuation-enhancing snout bag thus sealed, it is ready for use. As with the other forms of my evacuation-enhancing pillow-type bulk material shipper bags, I position the bag in a rigid container, such as a plastic shipping tote, so that the seams lie at the midpoints of opposing sides of the container. Alternatively, I can position the bag so that the seams lie in the corners of the tote, depending on the particular needs of the user. The position of the seams must be taken into account when making the bag, however, to ensure adequate material for proper sizing of the bag. With the bag positioned as desired, I then attach the snout to a source of bulk material, preferably using a spanner bar, and fill the bag. When the bag is full, I remove the snout from the spanner bar (if used), tie it off, and ship it. My invention thus provides a much less costly snout bag than prior art arrangements.</p>
    <p>All of my embodiments overcome all the disadvantages of the prior art discussed above. I enhance evacuation of the bags while keeping costs low and achieving a level of elegance of use. An additional benefit is that, when the interply region is substantially fully inflated, a portion of the bag rises out of the rigid container and acts as an indicator that the bag is empty. My bag and system can be used in any system that uses bags in rigid or semi-rigid containers using a bag with at least two plies, including any bulk material shipping system using, for example, closed-top pillow bags, open-top pillow bags, and fitted bags, that have a drain port in, at, or near the bottom of the container, though a drain port is not necessarily required. I do not employ external bladders, tilting bottoms, stiffening battens, or a pressure-resistant outer container as do prior art devices. Instead, I take advantage of the structure of the bags to form an inflatable air chamber between the plies of the bags using edge and other seals, bonds, or seams, the air chamber extending beneath some or all of the contents of the bag. My invention can be used with liquids, powders, pastes, or any other suitable bulk materials. Additionally, evacuation enhancement occurs automatically as bag contents level decreases so that no human intervention is required between setup and take down of the bag.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>My invention can be applied to most bulk material shipper bags including closed pillow bags, snorkel-top pillow bags, open-top pillow bags, and fitted bags. Bulk material shipper bags commonly include at least two edge seals (heat seal, tie off, or other type) on opposite sides or ends of the bag. Optionally, they can have a seal around the full perimeter of the bag. In my case, I prefer to form seals down the edges of the layers of material used to make the bag. I add a third seal to connect the two edge seals, if such a third seal is not already present. This third seal can be another edge seal or an internal seal or interply bond through the plies on one side of the bag. The seal should be placed roughly opposite the drain port at a distance of one half the smallest dimension of the container or more away from the drain port. The third seal should also be somewhere above the floor of the container, preferably at or above the midplane of the container.</p>
    <p>A fourth seal completes an inflatable air chamber in the interply region, and I add a fourth seal if it is not already present. One way to form the fourth seal is to use the weight of the bag contents, such as by placing the fold on the bottom of the container, so that the contents hold the plies together in a quasi-seals. Alternatively, a physical seal can be formed connecting the two edge seals positioned under the contents or on the opposite side of the contents from the third seal. Other seals can also be employed, or the seals can be combined into one or more continuous seals, but the four seals discussed above are the minimum required. The connection to the air chamber can be made at any point in the air chamber, but the air chamber inflates sooner and grows larger if the connection is made higher in the container.</p>
    <p>Referring to the accompanying Figures and using closed-top pillow bags as an exemplary embodiment, my invention comprises a multiple-ply bag <b>10</b> that is formed with an air input port <b>14</b> and an air input conduit <b>15</b> that allow air <b>6</b> from a source of pressurized air <b>2</b> to enter an inflatable air chamber formed in an interply region <b>204</b>, <b>205</b> of the bag <b>10</b>, lying between an outer ply <b>202</b>, <b>212</b> and an inner ply <b>201</b>, <b>211</b>, when certain conditions are met. The bag <b>10</b> is preferably of the pillow type and can be made with some variations, though my preferred embodiment shows the best performance. In all cases, a fill port <b>11</b> is included through the upper plies <b>24</b> and I prefer that a drain or exit port <b>12</b> be formed in the lower plies <b>25</b> in a manner consistent with the state of the art to allow appropriate connections to be made while preventing leakage. For closed-top pillow bags, the fill port <b>11</b> includes a fitting onto which a cap can be placed to seal the bag after filling. For snorkel-top bags, the fill port <b>11</b> is the opening of the snorkel and must be held open with a spanner bar on a fill head until the bag is filled, at which point the spanner bar is removed and the snorkel is tied off to close the bag. For open-top bags, the fill port <b>11</b> is simply the opening left by the absence of a top. For closed-top bags, I prefer to have the fill port <b>11</b> centrally located in the upper plies <b>24</b> so that it sits in the center of the top of the filled bag <b>10</b>. While the drain port <b>12</b> can be formed anywhere in or near the bottom <b>4</b> of the bag <b>10</b>, I prefer to form the drain port <b>12</b> so that it will sit near the bottom <b>4</b> in one of the sides of the filled bag <b>10</b>. While I show the bag <b>10</b> as having two upper plies <b>24</b> and two lower plies <b>25</b>, my invention can be used in a bag <b>10</b> that uses more plies. Also, while I show the plies as being rectangular, they can have any suitable shape that allows my invention to perform in a satisfactory manner. Where I speak of bonds and seams, these can be made in any manner consistent with the art, though I prefer to use heat sealing to create the bonds and seams for simplicity of manufacture and cost reduction. Further, the terms “upper” and “lower” are not meant to limit the orientation of the bag in use but are used to aid in the description of the exemplary embodiment.</p>
    <p>In one form of my invention, best seen in FIGS. 1A, <b>3</b>-<b>6</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, and <b>25</b>, I form the bag <b>10</b> by taking four layers of plastic and bonding their edges together to form seams <b>16</b>-<b>18</b> and <b>192</b>. The four layers can be made from two rectangular layers <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> cut in half as shown in FIGS. 20 and 23 and stacked as shown in FIG. <b>25</b>. The top two layers become upper plies <b>24</b> of the bag <b>10</b> and carry the fill port <b>11</b>. The other two become lower plies <b>25</b> of the bag <b>10</b> and carry the drain port <b>12</b>. The seams <b>16</b>-<b>18</b> and <b>192</b> form an equator seam of the bag <b>10</b> that seals an upper interply region <b>203</b> between the upper plies <b>24</b> of the bag <b>10</b> from a lower interply region <b>204</b> between the lower plies <b>25</b> of the bag <b>10</b>. The equator seam is the equivalent of the four seams discussed above. The air input port <b>14</b> in this embodiment is formed in the lower plies <b>25</b> and allows access to the lower interply region <b>204</b>. I prefer to form the air input port <b>14</b> by placing it between the lower plies <b>25</b> across what will be one of the seams before the plies are bonded as shown in FIG. <b>5</b>B. Alternatively, the input port <b>14</b> can be cut from the outer ply <b>212</b> as shown in FIG. <b>5</b>A and can include a fitting similar to that used in drain ports in the art.</p>
    <p>The air input port <b>14</b> can be kept sealed using a piece of air-tight flexible material, such as plastic film, and another piece of material, such as an elastomeric band, to hold the air-tight material on the air input port <b>14</b>. The outside end of the air input port <b>14</b> can include a fitting for easier attachment of the air input conduit <b>15</b>. The air input port <b>14</b> itself can be constructed from one or more plies of the same material used to make the bag <b>10</b>. Where more that one ply are used, the plies should be bonded together at the ends of the air input port <b>14</b>. In use, the air input conduit <b>15</b> can be held on the air input port <b>14</b> using an elastomeric band because of the low pressures within the joint between the air input port <b>14</b> and the air input conduit <b>15</b>.</p>
    <p>In a variation of the first embodiment best seen in FIGS. 20-25, I form the pillow bag <b>10</b> from two layers <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> of material cut into rectangles and fold the layers <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> in half to form four rectangular plies <b>201</b>, <b>202</b>, <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>. As they appear in the FIGS., the left halves of the layers <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> become the lower plies <b>25</b> and carry the exit port <b>12</b>, while the right layers become the upper plies <b>24</b> and carry the fill port <b>11</b>. After folding the layers <b>20</b>, <b>21</b>, I bond the non-fold edges of the plies together to form seams <b>16</b>-<b>18</b> which make a partial equator seam on the bag <b>10</b>. Here, opposing seams <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> are the first and second seams discussed above, and the intermediate seam is the second seam. The fold side <b>19</b> of the bag <b>10</b> can be treated in one of three ways: the layers of material can be bonded to each other along the fold <b>19</b> in an interlayer bond <b>191</b>; the layers can be bonded at the fold so that a seam or interply bond <b>192</b> can be formed with all four plies along or near the fold; or the layers can be bonded parallel to the fold in a top interlayer bond <b>23</b>, but some distance away from the fold <b>19</b>. Any of these three treatments of fold side <b>19</b> is the equivalent of the fourth seam discussed above.</p>
    <p>The bag <b>10</b> can be oriented with the equator seam horizontal, as shown in FIGS. 1A-10, or vertical, as shown in FIGS. 1B, <b>1</b>C, <b>2</b>B, and <b>2</b>C. In the vertical orientation, the bag can be arranged with the vertical seals <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> at the midpoints of the sides of the container <b>1</b> as seen in FIGS. 1B and 2B. For bags using corner drain ports, I prefer to place the vertical seals <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> at the corners of the container <b>1</b>, as seen in FIGS. 1C and 2C, when I orient the equator seam or partial equator seam vertically.</p>
    <p>Where I bond the layers <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> along the fold, best illustrated in FIGS. 21 and 24, I form the interlayer bond <b>191</b> before folding. The interlayer bond <b>191</b> completes the equator seam and seals the upper interply region <b>203</b> from the lower interply region <b>204</b> in the completed bag <b>10</b>. In both of these variations, I still form the air input port <b>14</b> in the lower plies <b>25</b> to allow access to the lower interply region <b>204</b>.</p>
    <p>I prefer to bond the layers of material parallel to the fold and between the fold and the fill port <b>11</b> so that the interlayer bond <b>23</b> is a boundary of two interply regions <b>205</b>, <b>206</b> of different dimensions, as is best seen in FIGS. 2A, <b>2</b>B, <b>2</b>C, <b>7</b>-<b>19</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>31</b>. The larger of the interply regions is a trans-fold interply region <b>205</b> that extends away from the fill port <b>11</b> on the top of the filled bag <b>10</b>, down the side of the filled bag <b>10</b>, along the bottom <b>4</b> of the filled bag <b>10</b>, and up the lower halves of the non-fold sides of the filled bag <b>10</b> to the partial equator seam including seams <b>16</b>-<b>18</b>. In this case, the plies are continuous from the interlayer bond <b>23</b> to the seam <b>17</b> opposite the fold line, but I will still refer to the upper portions of the plies as “upper plies” and to the lower portions of the plies as “lower plies” for the sake of simplicity. I prefer to form my air input port <b>14</b> to allow access to the larger interply region <b>205</b>, preferably in one of the seams <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> between the interlayer bond <b>23</b> and the fold line <b>19</b>. Alternatively, the air input port <b>14</b> can be cut through the outer ply <b>202</b> in the top of the bag <b>10</b> and include a fitting. To further enhance performance of the invention, I form diagonal seams <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> from the exit side of the bag <b>10</b> to the sides extending between the exit side and the fold side. The seams join all four plies and form two pieces or flaps <b>28</b>, <b>29</b> of extra material that can be trimmed away.</p>
    <p>My invention can be applied to typical multiple-ply fitted bags, as shown in FIGS. 1D and 1E, in much the same fashion as I apply it to pillow bags. The typical fitted bag will be cut from nested gussetted tubes of bag material. Adjacent cut gusset edges will be sealed to form the top and the bottom of the bag, each with gusset lines that are visible when the bag is filled, as is known in the art. The bottom seals are made on the individual plies prior to nesting, as is also known in the art. Of course, what I refer to as the top and bottom of the bag can be sides of the bag if the user wishes to change the bag's orientation. For a fitted bag with gusset lines on the top and bottom, the plies on the top have already been sealed to form interply bond <b>16</b>. I apply additional interply bonds <b>17</b>, <b>192</b> down opposite corners of the bag to define the interply regions. In a fitted bag with the gussets on the sides, I form one interply bond <b>16</b>′ along a top edge, another interply bond <b>17</b>′ on one gusset lined side from a corner at the end of the first interply bond to the lower opposite corner, and I use the sealed cut gusset edges of the other gusset lined side as a third interply bond <b>192</b>′ to define the interply regions. These three interply bonds <b>16</b>′, <b>17</b>′, and <b>192</b>′ are the equivalents of the interply bonds <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, and <b>192</b> of FIG. <b>1</b>D. The air input port passes through one of the interply bonds <b>16</b>, <b>16</b>′, <b>17</b>, <b>17</b>′, <b>192</b>, <b>192</b>′. Additional interply bonds can be added to enhance evacuation in much the manner described above.</p>
    <p>In use, I place one of my bags <b>10</b> in a rigid container <b>1</b>, such as a plastic tote, and align its exit port <b>12</b> with a hole in the tote. In many cases, this is best accomplished by using a cassette to hold the bag <b>10</b> during insertion and filling. The cassette is configured to hold the bag as it fills so that a minimum of bag material is trapped in the container during filling, which could reduce the shipped amount of bulk material. The cassette is typically made of an inexpensive, lightweight material, such as cardboard, and is particularly useful with closed-top pillow bags. With closed-top pillow bags, I place the bag <b>10</b> on its cassette in the bottom of the container <b>1</b>, attach a fill hose, and fill the bag <b>10</b> with bulk material or viscous contents <b>5</b>, the bag <b>10</b> unfolding as it fills. For best evacuation results with bags using corner drain ports, I place the bag <b>10</b> in the tote so that the side of the bag <b>10</b> opposite the drain port <b>12</b> is parallel to a diagonal of the tote (a 45° rotation of the bag <b>10</b> relative to the tote). I also situate the bag <b>10</b> so that there is more bag material near the air input port side of the tote. Once the bag <b>10</b> is full, I seal the fill port <b>11</b> in whatever manner is appropriate for the particular type of bag <b>10</b> used. The filled bag <b>10</b> and plastic tote <b>1</b> are then shipped to a customer, who connects the drain port <b>12</b>, if present, to a drain conduit <b>13</b> and starts using the contents <b>5</b>, beginning evacuation of the bag <b>10</b>. For some contents <b>5</b>, the customer also attaches a pump <b>3</b> to draw the contents <b>5</b> from the bag <b>10</b>. Other bulk materials <b>5</b> do not require a pump <b>3</b> and can simply be allowed to exit the bag <b>10</b> under the influence of gravity. For open-top bags without drain ports, the contents <b>5</b> can be drained using a hose connected to a pump <b>3</b> or acting as a siphon.</p>
    <p>The air input conduit <b>15</b> can be connected to a source of pressurized air <b>2</b> at any time, though I prefer that it be connected during initial set up at the site of bag evacuation when the exit port <b>12</b> is connected to the drain conduit <b>13</b>. The customer could also wait to connect the air input port <b>14</b> until the contents <b>5</b> had reached a particular level or until it became difficult to evacuate, but this requires human intervention that my invention intends to eliminate. Connecting the air input conduit <b>14</b> to the source of pressurized <b>2</b> air at any time other than initial setup is less efficient than my preferred choice of connecting the air input port <b>14</b> at initial set up since the alternatives require the customer to go back to the bag <b>10</b> to connect the air input conduit <b>15</b>, check the level of the contents <b>5</b>, monitor difficulty of contents evacuation, and/or wait until the pump <b>3</b> stalls.</p>
    <p>The source of pressurized air preferably provides enough pressure for my invention to work, yet not so much as to burst the bag <b>10</b>. I have found that the pressure required varies with the strength of the bag and as the inverse of the bag size. Bag strength is, of course, directly proportional to the total thickness of the plies of the bag and the strength of the bag material. The particular pressure ρ<sub>desired </sub>of the air provided by the source of pressurized air <b>2</b> will thus vary depending on the particular material strength τ of the bag (I prefer to use yield strength), total thickness t of the bag's plies, and the smallest diameter D of the bag when the bag is expanded and can be approximated using the formula <maths> <math overflow="scroll"> <mrow> <msub> <mi>p</mi> <mi>desired</mi> </msub> <mo>∝</mo> <mrow> <mfrac> <mrow> <mi>τ</mi> <mo></mo> <mstyle> <mtext> </mtext> </mstyle> <mo></mo> <mi>t</mi> </mrow> <mi>D</mi> </mfrac> <mo>.</mo> </mrow> </mrow> </math> <div class="patent-image small-patent-image"> <a href="//patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/US6234351B1/US06234351-20010522-M00001.png"> <img id="EMI-M00001" file="US06234351-20010522-M00001.TIF" img-content="math" img-format="tif" src="//patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/US6234351B1/US06234351-20010522-M00001.png" class="patent-full-image" alt="Figure US06234351-20010522-M00001"> </a> </div> <attachments> <attachment idref="MATHEMATICA-00001" attachment-type="nb" file="US06234351-20010522-M00001.NB"> </attachment> </attachments> </maths> </p>
    <p>For a typical shipper bag-in-box arrangement, this formula indicates that the source of pressurized air <b>2</b> preferably should provide air at a pressure of no more than from about 1 psig to about 5 psig. I prefer to use a pressure in the range of from about 0.05 psig to about 0.5 psig (about 0.2 psig, for example), which works quite well for the typical arrangement, using an intermediate bulk container in the 300 gallon range and using a total film thickness of about twelve thousandths of an inch (mils). Whatever pressure is used, as long as it does not exceed the value given by the formula above, it will be far less than the pressure required by the prior art for the same container size and total ply thickness. A pressure regulator can be used to ensure that the appropriate pressure is maintained. The source <b>2</b> can be depressurized shop air or can be a separate source, such as a compressor or fan.</p>
    <p>My invention begins to more noticeably enhance evacuation when the level of the contents <b>5</b> drops to a point where air <b>6</b> can enter the interply region <b>204</b>, <b>205</b>. Using the lower interply region <b>204</b> of the equator-seamed pillow bag <b>10</b>, air <b>6</b> begins to enter the interply region <b>204</b> when the pressure exerted on the inner ply <b>211</b> by the air <b>6</b> is greater than the pressure exerted on the inner ply <b>211</b> by the contents <b>5</b> of the bag <b>10</b>. Using the trans-fold interply region <b>205</b>, the interply region <b>205</b> fills in a much more complex manner that depends in part on exactly how the bag <b>10</b> is positioned and filled in the tote <b>1</b>, as well as the particular location of the air input port <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p>With particular reference to FIGS. 8-10 and <b>26</b>-<b>31</b>, for the preferred connection of the air input port <b>14</b> to the interply region <b>205</b>, the interply region <b>205</b> fills as the contents <b>5</b> of the bag <b>10</b> are evacuated. Initially, the top part of the outer ply <b>202</b>, <b>212</b> balloons or plumps up and the top part of the inner ply <b>201</b>, <b>211</b> urges the contents <b>5</b> to move away from the side wall as seen in FIG. 9, much like a wedge. As the bag contents level continues to drop, it is urged farther and farther from the side wall. Eventually the bag contents level drops enough and the interply region plumps enough that the bottom part of the inner ply <b>201</b>, <b>211</b> is pulled up and toward the drain port <b>12</b> as seen in FIGS. 9, <b>10</b>, and <b>28</b>-<b>31</b>.</p>
    <p>The plumping of the interply regions <b>204</b>, <b>205</b> of both variations has numerous effects. First, the bottom <b>4</b> of the bag <b>10</b> above the interply region <b>204</b>, <b>205</b> effectively gradually becomes a moving wall portion <b>31</b> of the bag <b>10</b> that urges the contents <b>5</b> toward the drain port <b>12</b> in the direction indicated by the arrows in FIGS. 6, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>, and <b>27</b>-<b>31</b>. In the process of becoming the moving wall portion <b>31</b>, the bottom <b>4</b> of the bag <b>10</b> inclines, allowing gravity to act on the contents <b>5</b> for a reduction in the amount or material retained in the bag <b>10</b> when no more material can be removed.</p>
    <p>Because the volume of the bag <b>10</b> interior is effectively reduced by the moving wall portion <b>31</b>, the level of the bag contents <b>5</b> in the remaining interior is kept above the top of the drain port <b>12</b> until nearly all of the contents <b>5</b> have been evacuated. In ordinary shipper bags, evacuation of the contents without allowing air into the interior of the bag causes the bag to collapse, yielding piles and folds of material floating on the free surface of the contents. The drain port of the ordinary shipper bag can become blocked by the folds and piles of bag material when the contents level drops below the top of the drain port. Drain port blockage can cause pump stalling and trap a significant amount of bag contents within the bag. However, the inflation of the interply region <b>205</b> of my shipper bag significantly delays or eliminates this blockage by keeping the level of the contents <b>5</b> above the drain port <b>12</b> longer. As the interply region <b>204</b>, <b>205</b> inflates, it also pulls any folds <b>30</b> of the inner ply <b>201</b>, <b>211</b> taut to reduce the number of folds <b>30</b>. The elimination of folds <b>30</b> of the inner ply <b>201</b>, <b>211</b> further reduces the risk of stalling the pump <b>3</b> since it prevents or at least significantly delays the folds <b>30</b> from being sucked against the drain port <b>12</b>. This eliminates the need for antivacuum devices and leaving the plunging arrow extended to prevent suction of the folds <b>30</b> against the drain port <b>12</b>. Alternatively, my invention enhances the effectiveness of antivacuum devices and extension of the plunging arrow if they are still employed. As an added benefit particularly shown in FIG. 10, the plumped bag <b>10</b> extends considerably above the top of the tote when the bag <b>10</b> is nearly empty so that it acts as a bag-empty indicator.</p>
    <p>To summarize the preferred operation of the invention with particular reference to FIGS. 26-31, prior to discharge of the bag contents, I connect the air chamber to a source <b>2</b> of low pressure air just sufficient to lift the contents <b>5</b> (less than one psig for a four-foot container). During discharge of the contents <b>5</b>, the inner ply <b>211</b> of the air chamber, mostly interply region <b>205</b>, moves the contents <b>5</b> to the drain port <b>12</b> so that the bag <b>10</b> is completely or nearly completely evacuated without human attendance. The air <b>6</b> expands the air chamber until a force balance is reached with the weight of the bulk material <b>5</b> (this can also be expressed as a pressure balance between air pressure and bulk material pressure on the inner ply). Since the air chamber extends down the wall of the container and under the bulk material <b>5</b>, it pushes the bulk material <b>5</b> away from the wall as it inflates. As the volume of the bag contents <b>5</b> diminishes, the air chamber continues to expand by inflation.</p>
    <p>The air chamber and the bag <b>10</b> are configured so that the air chamber expands to the greatest extent in a region of the container away from the drain <b>12</b>, thus forcing the contents <b>5</b> toward the drain <b>12</b>. As the chamber expands, the increased area on which the air pressure acts increases the force exerted on the bulk material <b>5</b> by the inner ply(ies) <b>201</b>, <b>211</b> of the bag. The force reaches a maximum when the bag is nearly completely evacuated, at which point the bag material would normally obstruct the drain <b>12</b>. However, the bulk material <b>5</b> at the drain <b>12</b> floats adjacent bag material above the drain <b>12</b>, preventing the bag material from blocking the drain <b>12</b> and trapping bulk material <b>5</b> in the bag. Additionally, the inflation of the air chamber pulls the bag material taut so that the drain <b>12</b> remains unobstructed.</p>
    <p>The fitting of the drain <b>12</b> is locked in the container and seals through the bag plies <b>201</b>, <b>202</b>, <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>. This anchors or ties the bag <b>10</b> down at one point in, at, or near the floor of the container <b>1</b>. This also limits the inflation of the air chamber at and around the drain port <b>12</b>. The air chamber is also configured so that its expansion pulls the layers <b>201</b>, <b>202</b>, <b>211</b>, <b>212</b> of the bag taut. When the volume of bulk material <b>5</b> left in the bag <b>10</b> is insufficient to float the bag material above the drain <b>12</b>, this tension helps to prevent the bag material from closing off the drain <b>12</b>. The air chamber is optimally configured so that, near the end of evacuation, all the remaining bulk material <b>5</b> is lifted off the floor of the container <b>1</b>, above the level of the drain <b>12</b>. This allows the bulk material <b>5</b> to flow down into the drain <b>12</b> as if it were in a funnel. The bulk material <b>5</b> can be used as a fourth quasi-seal, as seen in FIGS. 26-31. If the bulk material <b>5</b> is used as a fourth quasi-seal, then air seeps under the bulk material <b>5</b> and expands into air chambers, including interply region <b>206</b>, on both sides of the bulk material <b>5</b> formed in the main air chamber by the presence of the bulk material <b>5</b>. This action pulls the bag layer in front of the drain up at an angle, providing a gap for flow of the remaining bulk material <b>5</b> to the drain port.</p>
    <p>I can also include an integral filling conduit <b>110</b> in my exemplary embodiment of an evacuation enhanced pillow bag <b>10</b>′, as particularly shown in FIGS. 32-36. I also refer to the integral filling conduit as a snout. With respect to this aspect of the invention, I make reference to my U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/238,338, filed concurrently herewith, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. This form of my invention is very similar in its construction and use to that shown in FIGS. 2A, <b>2</b>B, <b>2</b>C, <b>7</b>-<b>19</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>31</b>. To make my bag with a snout, I prefer to start with two pieces of material <b>100</b>′, <b>100</b>″ very much as described above and stacked so that, when folded in half, one half of each piece of material <b>100</b>′, <b>100</b>″ forms a back layer or ply <b>101</b>′, <b>101</b>″, and the other half of each piece of material <b>100</b>′, <b>100</b>″ forms a front layer or ply <b>102</b>′, <b>102</b>″. Alternatively, the back and front layers can each be their own separate pieces of material rather than halves of larger pieces of material. Preferably, the layers of material <b>100</b>′, <b>100</b>″ are rectangular. I then take the two back layers <b>101</b>′, <b>101</b>″ and bond them together to form a rear interlayer or interply bond <b>23</b>′, which is similar in location and function to the top interlayer bond <b>23</b> mentioned above. I also form the rear snout interlayer bond <b>111</b>′. I insert an air input conduit <b>15</b>′ between the back layers <b>101</b>′, <b>101</b>″ to allow access to a back interply region <b>120</b> between the back layers <b>101</b>′, <b>101</b>″ as seen particularly in FIG. <b>35</b>. The back interply region <b>120</b> is similar in form and function to the smaller interply region <b>206</b> described above.</p>
    <p>Next I take the two front layers <b>102</b>′, <b>102</b>″ and bond them together to form a front interlayer or interply bond <b>108</b>, as well as the front snout interlayer bond <b>111</b>″. I then bond all four layers <b>101</b>′, <b>101</b>″, <b>102</b>′, <b>102</b>″ together to form the sides and base of the rectangle and the sides of the trapezoid with seams or seals <b>16</b>′, <b>18</b>′, <b>26</b>′, <b>27</b>′. Depending on the particular application of the bag, I can also seal along the fold line <b>19</b>′. If this is done before the pieces of material <b>100</b>′, <b>100</b>″ are folded, then an interply bond <b>191</b>′ is formed between the pieces of material <b>100</b>′, <b>100</b>″. If this is done after the pieces of material <b>100</b>′, <b>100</b>″ are folded, or if this is done where each layer <b>101</b>′, <b>102</b>′, <b>101</b>″, <b>102</b>″ is its own piece of material, then an interply bond <b>192</b>′ is formed between all four layers <b>101</b>′, <b>102</b>′, <b>101</b>″, <b>102</b>″. I form the drain port <b>12</b>′ in the front layers <b>102</b>′, <b>102</b>″.</p>
    <p>The seams <b>16</b>′, <b>18</b>′, <b>26</b>′, <b>27</b>′, the rear interlayer bond <b>23</b>′, and front interlayer bond <b>108</b> define the back interply region <b>120</b> and a front interply region <b>130</b>. While I prefer to include the front interlayer bond <b>108</b> to improve performance of the enhanced snout bag <b>10</b>′, it can be left out, in which case the fold <b>19</b>′is used to delineate the two interply regions <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> in much the same way as the variation of my enhanced pillow bag of FIGS. 2A, <b>2</b>B, <b>2</b>C, <b>7</b>-<b>19</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>31</b>, and the bulk material <b>5</b> acts to seal the regions from each other.</p>
    <p>The rear and front interply bonds <b>23</b>′, <b>108</b>, along with the side seams <b>16</b>′, <b>18</b>′, <b>26</b>′, and <b>27</b>′, define an inflatable air chamber in the back and rear interply regions <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>. The air chamber extends from the back interply bond <b>107</b> down the side of the bag <b>10</b>′, under the contents of the filled bag <b>100</b>′, and up the opposite side of the bag <b>10</b>′ to the front interply bond <b>108</b>. When a user is ready to discharge the contents of the filled bag <b>10</b>′, he or she connects the air input conduit <b>15</b>′ to a source of pressurized air. As the contents of the bag <b>10</b>′ are discharged, the air chamber inflates, expanding the interply regions <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>. The inflation of the air chamber pulls up on the inner ply <b>101</b>″, <b>102</b>″ along the side and bottom of the bag <b>100</b>′.</p>
    <p>Here, as shown particularly in FIG. 9, I prefer to arrange the bag <b>10</b>′ with the edge seams <b>16</b>′, <b>18</b>′, <b>26</b>′, and <b>27</b>′ in the corners of the rigid container <b>1</b>′ and the drain port <b>12</b>′ protruding from a hole in the rigid container <b>1</b>′. Once the bag <b>10</b>′ is filled, the air input conduit <b>15</b>′ runs up between the side of the bag <b>10</b>′ and the side of the container <b>1</b>′ and over the edge of the container <b>1</b>′.</p>
    <p>Prior to discharge of the bag contents, I connect the air chamber to a source of low pressure air just sufficient to lift the contents (preferably less than one psig for a four-foot container). During discharge of the contents, the inner ply <b>101</b>′, <b>102</b>′ of the air chamber moves the contents to the drain <b>12</b>′ so that the bag <b>10</b>′ is completely or nearly completely evacuated without human attendance. The air expands the air chamber until a force balance is reached with the weight of the fluid (this can also be expressed as a pressure balance between air pressure and fluid pressure on the inner ply). Since the air chamber extends down the wall of the container and under the fluid, it pushes the fluid away from the wall as it inflates. As the volume of the bag contents diminishes, the air chamber continues to expand by inflation.</p>
    <p>The air chamber and the bag are preferably configured so that the air chamber expands to the greatest extent in a region of the container away from the drain, thus forcing the contents toward the drain. As the chamber expands, the increased area on which the air pressure acts increases the force exerted on the fluid by the inner ply(ies) of the bag. The force reaches a maximum when the bag is nearly completely evacuated, at which point the bag material would normally obstruct the drain. However, the fluid at the drain floats adjacent bag material above the drain, preventing the bag material from blocking the drain and trapping fluid in the bag. Additionally, the inflation of the air chamber pulls the bag material taut so that the drain remains unobstructed.</p>
    <p>The drain fitting is locked in the container and seals through the bag plies. This anchors or ties the bag down at one point in, at, or near the floor of the container. This also limits the inflation of the air chamber at and around the drain port. The air chamber is also configured so that its expansion pulls the layers of the bag taut. When the volume of fluid left in the bag is insufficient to float the bag material above the drain, this tension prevents the bag material from closing off the drain. The air chamber is optimally configured so that, near the end of evacuation, all the remaining fluid is lifted off the floor of the container, above the level of the drain. This allows the fluid to flow down into the drain as if it were in a funnel. The fluid can be used as a fourth quasi-seal. If the fluid is used as a fourth quasi-seal, then air seeps under the fluid and expands into chambers on both sides of the fluid formed in the main air chamber by the presence of the fluid. This action enhances the evacuation by pulling the bag layer in from the of drain up at an angle. This angle provides a gap for flow of the remaining fluid to the drain port.</p>
