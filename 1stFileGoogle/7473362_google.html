    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <heading>Field of the Invention</heading> <p num="p-0002">There has been a need for individuals to hydrate themselves when away from the convenience of municipal water for some time. Initially, sport bottles and other small containers were employed simply to store and take water away from home. As people became aware of the problems initially of chlorine and later lead that was present in municipally treated water, sport bottles with a variety of different filters were developed and marketed to the consumer for the past fifteen years or more. For the most part they have been effective at removing taste and odor, and in one or more cases heavy metals such as lead and mercury. More recently, a second series of portable products have been introduced to reduce the contamination of protozoa cysts and bacteria. A few may make claims pertaining to bacteria, but under the scrutiny of the test data independently developed by third parties, fail in one or more categories. Typically, virus have proven to be the most difficult as their size prevents conventional filtration by size exclusion. Thus, products incorporating iodinated resin providing an iodine residual have been introduced to the market.</p>
    <p num="p-0003">To devitalize the organism with residual iodine requires several minutes of contact time, which is not provided in a Sport Bottle configuration where the user drinks directly from the bottle. Other products using an ultra violet light make excellent claims for bacteria and virus, but neglect the largest of the biological contaminants, protozoa cysts, the most important to the domestic user in the United States and Canada. The UV is not as effective against the heavier shelled protozoa, nor in highly turbid water. Battery life also becomes a consideration as is the quantity of water that may continuously be treated.</p>
    <p num="p-0004">These problems are further exasperated by military requirements which must either transport large quantities of treated water prior to dispensing to the canteens of the individual soldier, or use slow and marginally effective means to treat surface waters that may be encountered in the field. To fill the anticipated requirements of the military it becomes a requirement to remove both biological and chemical contaminants, and to the degree possible nuclear contaminants that could be present. A recently developed filtration media termed Charged Layered Membrane Technology circumvents a myriad of problems, most particularly the elimination of most all-biological contamination. For military purposes this is combined with technology know as “Static Filtration” for the removal of chemical and potentially nuclear contaminants.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">The deficiencies found in portable filtration devices are now overcome through the use of Charged Layered Membrane Technology, a new type filter normally formed as an accordion pleated closed end cylinder, either structurally independent or enclosed within an out filter body for attachment directly or indirectly to the bottle or canteen top and drinking spout. The uniqueness of this filter is that it consists primarily of Nano glass fibers onto which charged alumina fibers are permanently bonded. The alumina exhibiting a sufficiently strong positive charge potential to attract and hold dipole and negatively charged organisms and particles. As a result the media removes the biological contaminants consisting of protozoa cysts, bacteria, and virus as well as turbid particulate matter when properly applied. In addition this membrane structure may contain activated carbon for the removal of certain chemical species.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">Chemical elements adsorbed by activated carbon including chlorine, taste and odor are reduced within the specifications established by NSF meeting the criteria for NSF Standard 42. The carbon content is extremely fine, ˜8 micron, and is integrated within the membrane body equaling 30 percent, by weight of the total membrane weight. It is particularly effective as none of the adsorption sites are blinded, not being retained by a polymer binder, as found in the manufacture of carbon block filters. With the charged membrane, using NSF testing protocol, 1500 gallons of prepared 2 ppm chlorine effluent water will pass through 1 ft<sup>2 </sup>of membrane surface being reduced to less than 0.5 ppm, the NSF standard at a flow exceeding 1 GPM. The encapsulated activated carbon component provides an 800 fold improvement for iodine recovery over a comparable carbon element. The exceptional performance is the result of two unique features. One, the powder is exceptionally fine, 99 percent of the carbon is smaller than 325 sieve size, and 90 percent is smaller than 625 sieve size providing several orders of magnitude more adsorption sites, none of which are blinded.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">The charged membrane consists of two layers of heat bonded polyspun scrim containing the body of the membrane with a thickness, not limited to, but ideally between 0.8 mm and 1.1 mm. The contained glass-alumina fiber matrix exhibit the very strong positive charge potential of 50μν which spans the entire pore diameter. The density of the Nano alumina fibers is 2.7 g/c<sup>3</sup>. The thusly formed membrane assembly has a high absorbent capacity for biological contaminants and turbidity, all contaminants exhibiting a negative or diapole charge potential. The membrane exhibits good absorbent potential in the pH. range of 3-10. The membrane structure is 90 percent void volume and 10 percent solids with a nominal pore size of ˜1 micron enhancing the ready flow of water through the membrane. However, each pore contains some 400 individual and independent filtration attraction sites within the membrane core. Flow rates, with a pressure drop of only 0.2 to 0.3 psig, will exceed the flow required in a sport bottle 10 to 30 ml/sec, once wetted. The very small contaminant elements such as bacteria, virus, and fine turbidity, are retained principally by electro adhesion, the result of the positive charge potential within the membrane cross section, rather than physical entrapment upon the surface based upon particle size. The media has a high dynamic response for adsorption, without the use of anion exchange resins, allowing several orders of magnitude of purification within a very shallow bed, and doing so at pressures below 15 psig and at flow rates an order of magnitude or greater than can be achieved with an ultra porous membrane. For instance, a charged membrane filter depth of 1.8 mm will retain 6 LRV of MS2 virus at a flow rate of 10 ml/cm2/min (100 Liters/m2/min). The residence time is about 1 second.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">The charged membrane is formed by placing the membrane material, in either or both sheet and accordion pleated form, for increased surface area, over an open supporting grid. Alternatively, a secondary internal molded or non-woven media filter containing complementing capability may be incorporated. The secondary filter is used to remove lead and mercury through the application of ATS, which is available from BASF. Other media for the removal of arsenic, available from BASF, and the elimination of radionuclides may be affected through the use of available polymer extraction technology originally developed by The Los Alamos National Laboratory and licensed from the University of California, the operating contractor, may be applied. The membrane is preferably applied in accordion pleated form, but may be applied in simple cylindrical form with reduced surface area. The membrane ends are potted or molded into the end components to form a sealed unit. In filters with a relatively large base diameter. The base may also be applied as a filtration surface. The basic membrane media is available from Ahlstrom Corporation and is sold under the trade name Disruptor™.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">The Static liquid treatment media disposed within the inner body functions differently than the typical hollow block carbon dynamic filter normally used in filtration devices. The media consists of fine non-woven polyester fibers, which are specially treated to permit bonding upon their entire surface a layer of activated carbon, zeolytes, ion exchange resins, or other treatment media in fine powder form in such a manner as to retain the media to the fibers with minimum blinding of the active sites. Functionally, the water being treated is continually in contact with the media. There are voids within the coated fiber matrix containing the water. As the contaminants are removed from the water in contact with the media coated fibers, the remaining contaminants seeking equilibrium migrate into the area adjacent to the fibers and are in turn removed. Thus, the process of contaminant dispersion caused by the search for equilibrium rapidly removes most all of the contaminants from the contained water. No other process is as effective, nor provides the extended residence time that static filtration does given extended residence time. In a portable product the movement of the water within the device further enhances dispersion and contact with the treatment fibers.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">In a preferred embodiment the static filtration media comprises a nonwoven mat of a material capable of meeting 21 CFR 177.2260, having a weight of between about 4-7 oz/sq. yd., and a coating comprising about 100-200 percent of the weight of the mat, and including, by weight, or about 60-85 percent activated carbon, about 10-20 percent binder, and about 0-25 percent zeolite. Desirably the static filtration media has been compressed in one dimension about 25-75 percent, e.g. about 40-60 percent, so as to provide a substantially uniform pore size, and has an RDV-IBV ratio of about 0.3-0.8, as measured by the cessation of streaming flow and a porosity of at least 90 percent.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">As applied to water treatment devices, when used in conjunction with the charged layered technology, the products are designed to retain sufficient water within the void area of the fiber matrix to satisfy the normal quantity of water removed by drinking at any one instant. This may be referred to as the normal periodic demand cycle.</p>

    <p num="p-0038"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the outer housing <b>1</b>, with the separate base element <b>2</b>, snapped into the housing at location <b>10</b>. The base <b>2</b> contains spacing pins <b>13</b> to elevate the membrane assembly <b>7</b> to provide water access to the base of the filter <b>11</b>. The base is preferably covered with flat membrane sheeting providing flow up through the base as well as radially as a result of the water access chamber <b>15</b>. Alternatively, the base <b>11</b> may be solid for economy. The filter body <b>7</b> is preferably formed with accordion pleats increasing the radial surface area. However, the body <b>7</b> may also be formed from straight sheet stock. The filter body <b>7</b> is contained between molded sealing ends <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>. The filter assembly <b>9</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>8</b> is pressed into the housing <b>1</b> forming an “O” ring seal at <b>14</b>, and welded to the outer housing <b>1</b> by means of a raised rib for this purpose <b>6</b>. The water enters <b>5</b> when the bottle is tipped allowing water to flow into the reservoir <b>15</b> which in turn forces the water under minimal pressure through the membrane <b>7</b>. The treated water hence flowing out of the open center of the charged membrane filter assembly at <b>12</b> to exit at <b>4</b>. The housing <b>1</b> has threads <b>12</b> molded onto the body <b>1</b> for attaching to the bottle.</p>
    <p num="p-0039">Section A-A is a cross section of the membrane assembly in normal construction. Section AA-AA is a cross section with a secondary media filter contained within.</p>
    <p num="p-0040"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> A-A is a cross section drawing showing the charged membrane <b>7</b>, formed into an accordion pleated form. In a single media format, the membrane is formed and supported by an inner plastic cage <b>16</b>, providing strength to resist the radial force of the water being forced through the membrane. The cage <b>16</b> also provides axial strength for designs which may choose to have a press fit of the assembled filter to the housing. The base end of the membrane <b>7</b> is encapsulated and sealed in (molded in) the end cap <b>9</b>. A similar end cap is used at the top, as well. The base is preferably a flat sheet of the charged membrane sealed and held in place by the end cap <b>9</b>. This provides the opportunity to increase the available membrane surface area. For economical reasons the base may be closed by redesigning the plastic end cap <b>9</b> to encompass the entire base.</p>
    <p num="p-0041"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> AA-AA is identical to the preceding description with the exception that a closed base end composite filter <b>17</b>, replaces the cage <b>16</b> of the preceding drawing. This composite filter and its composite base add a secondary filter with varying characteristics such as to remove lead through the inclusion of ATS as supplied by BASF, or PEXT for the removal of radio active matter as produced by (np) Energy Nevada. An activated carbon block filter is also a natural secondary filter if the carbon, or sufficient carbon, is not incorporated within the primary charged membrane <b>7</b>.</p>

To drink, the high flow valve <b>34</b> is elevated, pulled open, and the bottle is tilted. To aid the flow of water, the bottle <b>30</b> is squeezed and negative pressure may be added by sucking. The top <b>31</b> with the filter <b>22</b> assembled is attached to the bottle <b>30</b> by the threaded connection <b>38</b>. A seal <b>37</b> assures a secure leak-less assembly between the bottle <b>30</b>, and top <b>31</b>, filter <b>22</b>, assembly. An air relief valve <b>32</b> aids in the re-inflation of the bottle without draining water from the filter <b>22</b>.</p>

Particle filter <b>45</b> is employed to catch any fines, which may sluff off the internal static filtration media. The open space between the outer housing <b>42</b> and membrane <b>41</b> is a water reservoir <b>43</b>, which delivers the water to the entire membrane surface <b>41</b> regardless of the quantity of water within the canteen with equal pressure to the membrane.
