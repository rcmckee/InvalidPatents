The IMD includes a catheter having one or more ports, each of which is individually controlled by a respective pair of conductive members located in proximity to the port. According to the invention, a voltage potential difference generated across a respective pair of conductive members is used to control drug delivery via the respective port. In one embodiment of the current invention, each port includes a cap member formed of a conductive material. This cap member is electrically coupled to one of the conductive members associated with the port to form an anode. The second one of the conductive members is located in proximity to the port and serves as a cathode. When the cap member is exposed to a conductive fluid such as blood, a potential difference generated between the conductors causes current to flow from the anode to the catheter, dissolving the cap so that a biologically active agent is released to the body. In another embodiment of the invention, each port is in proximity to a reservoir or other expandable member containing a cross-linked polymer gel of the type that expands when placed within an electrical field. Creation of an electric field between respective conductive members across the cross-linked polymer gel causes the gel to expand. In one embodiment, this expansion causes the expandable member to assume a state that blocks the exit of the drug from the respective port. Alternatively, the expansion may be utilized to assert a force on a bolus of the drug so that it is delivered via the respective port. Drug delivery is controlled by a control circuit that selectively activates one or more of the predetermined ports."><meta name="DC.date" content="2003-5-27" scheme="issued"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4140121" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4793825" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4902278" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5016646" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5165403" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5292338" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5305745" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5306293" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5314430" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5368704" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5551849" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5609622" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5651979" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5662689" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5700481" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5797898" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5817131" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5820589" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5845396" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5876741" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5893881" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5935159" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5968087" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:6002955" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:6178349" scheme="references"><meta name="citation_reference" content="&quot;Glue&#39; for Biochips Developed,&quot; Medical Device &amp; Diagnostic Industry, p. 20 (Nov. 2000)."><meta name="citation_reference" content="&quot;Smart&#39; Implants Could Assist Patient Medication,&quot; Medical Device &amp; Diagnostic Industry, p. 21-22 (Nov. 2000)."><meta name="citation_reference" content="Bae et al., &quot;Pulsatile Drug Release by Electric Stimulus,&quot; ACS Symposium Series, Ch. 8, 545, p. 98-110 (1994)."><meta name="citation_reference" content="Kwon et al., &quot;Electrically Erodible Polymer Gel for Controlled Release of Drugs,&quot; Nature, vol. 354, p. 291-294 (1991)."><meta name="citation_reference" content="Li et al., &quot;Reversal of Reflex-Induced Myocardial Ischemia by Median Nerve Stimulation: A Feline Model of Electroacupuncture,&quot; Circulation, 97(12), p. 1186-1194 (Mar. 31, 1998)."><meta name="citation_patent_number" content="US:6571125"><meta name="citation_patent_application_number" content="US:09/781,750"><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.google.com/patents/US6571125"/><meta property="og:url" content="http://www.google.com/patents/US6571125"/><meta name="title" content="Patent US6571125 - Drug delivery device"/><meta name="description" content="An Implantable Medical Device (IMD) for controllably releasing a biologically-active agent such as a drug to a body is disclosed.

The IMD includes a catheter having one or more ports, each of which is individually controlled by a respective pair of conductive members located in proximity to the port. According to the invention, a voltage potential difference generated across a respective pair of conductive members is used to control drug delivery via the respective port. In one embodiment of the current invention, each port includes a cap member formed of a conductive material. This cap member is electrically coupled to one of the conductive members associated with the port to form an anode. The second one of the conductive members is located in proximity to the port and serves as a cathode. When the cap member is exposed to a conductive fluid such as blood, a potential difference generated between the conductors causes current to flow from the anode to the catheter, dissolving the cap so that a biologically active agent is released to the body. In another embodiment of the invention, each port is in proximity to a reservoir or other expandable member containing a cross-linked polymer gel of the type that expands when placed within an electrical field. Creation of an electric field between respective conductive members across the cross-linked polymer gel causes the gel to expand. In one embodiment, this expansion causes the expandable member to assume a state that blocks the exit of the drug from the respective port. Alternatively, the expansion may be utilized to assert a force on a bolus of the drug so that it is delivered via the respective port. Drug delivery is controlled by a control circuit that selectively activates one or more of the predetermined ports.</div>

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention concerns a system for treating a physiological disorder using a drug delivery catheter; and, more particularly, relates to an implantable medical device to remotely deliver drugs, and in some instances, electrical stimulation, to a patient to regulate the heart, the vascular system, and other bodily systems.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Drug delivery therapies are often a primary component of an overall patient health plan. The successful use of many drugs is often dependent upon the manner in which the drugs are administered. Some therapies require that the drug be delivered in response to specific biofeedback indicators. Other treatments prescribe the use of predetermined drugs over a long period of time. This makes the selection of a proper drug delivery method problematic. Additionally, lack of patient compliance may render a drug therapy program ineffective. Drug delivery also becomes problematic when the drugs are too potent for systemic delivery.</p>
    <p>For all of the foregoing reasons, it is often desirable to utilize an implantable drug delivery system. Implantable drug delivery systems are in widespread use to provide site-specific and/or sustained delivery of beneficial agents to address adverse patient conditions. Such delivery systems may include implantable infusion pumps, which typically include a pressurized drug reservoir and some form of fluid flow control.</p>
    <p>While implantable drug delivery systems are known, such systems are generally not capable of accurately controlling the dosage of drugs delivered to the patient. This is particularly essential when dealing with drugs that can be toxic in higher concentrations. One manner of controlling drug delivery involves using electro-release techniques for controlling the delivery of a biologically-active agent or drug. The delivery process can be controlled by selectively activating the electro-release system, or by adjusting the rate of release. Several systems of this nature are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,876,741 and 5,651,979 which describe a system for delivering active substances into an environment using polymer gel networks. Another drug delivery system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,797,898 to Santini, Jr. which discusses the use of switches provided on a microchip to control the delivery of drugs. Yet another delivery device is discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,368,704 which describes the use of an array of valves formed on a monolithic substrate that can be selectively activated to control the flow rate of a substance through the substrate.</p>
    <p>None of the foregoing references describe a manner of utilizing an electro-release system within an implantable medical device such as a catheter. Therefore, what.is needed is an improved electro-release system for selectively delivering drugs alone, or in combination with, electrical stimulation to a patient to provide an optimal therapy that is not dependent on patient compliance.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The current invention provides an Implantable Medical Device (IMD) for controllably releasing a biologically-active agent such as a drug to a body. In one embodiment, the IMD includes a catheter having one or more ports, each of which is individually controlled by a respective pair of conductive members located in proximity to the port. According to the invention, a voltage potential difference generated across a respective pair of conductive members is used to control drug delivery via the respective port.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of the current invention, each port includes a cap member formed of a conductive material. This cap member is electrically coupled to one of the conductive members associated with the port to form an anode. The second one of the conductive members is located in proximity to the port and serves as a cathode. When the cap member is exposed to a conductive fluid such as blood, a potential difference may be generated to cause current flow from the anode to the catheter. This causes the cap member to oxidize and dissolve in the blood, which allows a biologically-active agent to be released from the catheter into the blood.</p>
    <p>In another embodiment of the invention, each port is in proximity to a reservoir or other expandable member containing a cross-linked polymer gel of the type that expands when placed within an electrical field. Generation of a voltage potential difference in the respective conductive members associated with the port creates an electric field across the cross-linked polymer gel, causing it to expand. This expansion exerts a force on the walls of reservoir or expandable member containing the gel, which may, in turn, be used to control the release of the biologically-active agent. According to one embodiment, the expandable member is a disk having an aperture in the center that swells to a closed state upon generation of the electric field. When the aperture is in the closed state, the biologically-active agent is prevented from exiting the port. According to another embodiment, the swelling of the polymer gel exerts a force against a flexible member that forms at least a portion of the reservoir containing the polymer gel. As a result, the flexible member covers the catheter port, preventing delivery of the drug through the port. In an alternative configuration, force exerted by expansion of the polymer exerts force against a slidable member that forms at least one wall of the reservoir. As a result, slidable member exerts a force against a bolus of a drug that is located within a second reservoir of the catheter, forcing a dosage of the drug from the port.</p>
    <p>The catheter of the current invention may include local reservoirs containing the biologically-active agents. These local reservoirs are located in proximity to a respective port. Each of the reservoirs may contain the same, or a different, biologically-active agent as compared to the other local reservoirs. Alternatively, a storage reservoir may be located remotely within an IMD coupled to the proximal end of the catheter. In this case, the remote storage reservoir may be coupled to a drug infusion pump that pumps the agent contained within the remote reservoir to one or more of the ports via-an internal lumen within the catheter body.</p>
    <p>According to another aspect of the current invention, the IMD may include a control circuit to selectively activate one or more of the conductor pairs, thereby controlling the delivery of one or more drugs via the respective ports.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of the invention, the catheter may include one or more electrodes to provide electrical stimulation to the body. The control circuit of the IMD may include means to coordination this electrical stimulation with the drug delivery therapy. For example, an analgesic agent may be delivered to the body at a predetermined time prior to the delivery of cardioversion/defibrillation stimulation to thereby minimize patient discomfort associated with the electrical stimulation.</p>
    <p>In another embodiment of the invention, the catheter may include one or more biological sensors to provide one or more biological signals to the control circuit of the IMD. The control circuit may include means to control the delivery of the electrical stimulation and/or drug delivery therapy based on the one or more biological signals provided by the biological sensors.</p>
    <p>According to yet another aspect of the invention, the ports of the catheter may be of varying sizes. By selectively allowing drug delivery to be performed via a predetermined combination of these ports, a precise drug dosage may be released to the body.</p>
    <p>Other aspects of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following description and the accompanying drawings.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p>The present invention provides an Implantable Medical Device. (IMD) that is adapted to controllably deliver one or more biologically-active agents to a body from a local and/or remote source. In one embodiment, this IMD includes a catheter including, or coupled to, one or more reservoirs storing the one or more biologically-active agents. These agents are controllably released upon generation of control signals by the control circuitry of the IMD, as is discussed in detail below.</p>
    <p>FIG. 1 is a plan view of an implantable medical device <b>2</b> and drug delivery system according to one embodiment of the invention. According to this embodiment, the inventive system is employed to deliver drugs to selected nerves to control a patient's heart rate. FIG. 1 includes an illustration of a patient's vascular system, diagramming heart <b>4</b> and the associated vascular and nervous system. The heart pumps oxygenated blood out through the aortic arch <b>6</b>, which leads to a right subclavian artery <b>8</b>, a right common carotid <b>10</b>, a left common carotid <b>12</b>, a left subclavian artery <b>14</b>, and a thoracic aorta <b>16</b>. The bifurcation of the carotid arteries <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> leads to external carotid arteries <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>, respectively, and further to internal carotid arteries <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>, respectively.</p>
    <p>FIG. 1 further shows vagus nerves <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> that are intercoupled to the aortic arch <b>6</b> via cardiac depressor nerves <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>, respectively. The areas immediately above the bifurcations of the carotid arteries <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> are referred to as the carotid sinus bodies <b>38</b> and <b>40</b>. A number of nerves extend from the stretch receptors at the bifurcation of the carotid arteries in the carotid sinus. For example, nerve branches <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> extend from the carotid sinus bodies <b>38</b> and <b>40</b>, respectively, and join the ganglions <b>46</b> and <b>48</b>, respectively, of the vagus nerves. Other nerve fibers comprising the carotid sinus nerve branches <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> of the glossopharyngeal nerves <b>54</b> and <b>56</b>, respectively, also extend from the carotid sinus bodies <b>38</b> and <b>40</b>.</p>
    <p>According to one use of the current inventive system, an implantable medical device (IMD) 2 is provided to control the remote delivery of biologically-active agents such as veratrum alkaloid to the vagus nerves. IMD 2 is shown coupled to two catheters <b>54</b> and <b>56</b>, although only one, or more than two, catheters may be used. These catheters, which may be of any of the embodiments discussed below, are shown implanted in the proximity of the right and left carotid sinus nerves <b>50</b> and <b>52</b>, respectively. The specific location of these catheters may be varied along the carotid sinus nerves, and it is contemplated that in the practice of the present invention it may be possible to place such stimulators in the vicinity of any of the nerves shown in FIG. 1, such as any of the nerves associated with the myocardial baroreceptors.</p>
    <p>The IMD 2 includes internal circuitry and an electrically-activated power source for selectively controlling the delivery of one or more biologically-active agents via catheters <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> in a manner to be described below. The power source may assume a wide variety of forms, such as a battery, a large capacitor with a slow discharge rate, or various other mechanical devices. Further, as described elsewhere, the IMD 2 may include additional circuitry for sensing and interpreting cardiovascular activity, and for activating and deactivating electrodes provided on catheters <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> to provide electrical stimulation to predetermined nerves in conjunction with the delivery of biologically-active agents.</p>
    <p>The exemplary use of the current invention in accordance with FIG. 1 provides a marked improvement over previous stimulation systems incorporating only an electrode. By controlling heart rate through the chemical and electrical stimulation of selected nerves, the required level and/or duration of electrode stimulation is greatly reduced, thereby improving battery life and avoiding nerve desensitization. Further, where the nerve stimulating drug is a veratrum alkaloid, direct application of the veratrum alkaloid to the selected nerve avoids the toxicity and side effects encountered with systemic delivery. Finally, by coordinating electrical stimulation as provided by the one or more electrodes provided by catheters <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> with the drug therapy, optimized treatment can be achieved. Various mechanisms for coordinating electrical stimulation and drug therapy are described in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,178,349 issued Jan. 23, 2001 entitled “Drug Delivery Neural Stimulation Device for Treatment of Cardiovascular Disorders” incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
    <p>IMD 2 may further include a pulse generation circuit to deliver pacing or cardioversion stimulation pulses discussed further below. The pulse generation circuit may be of a type commonly known in the art and may include-an indifferent case electrode <b>60</b>, and one or more electrodes positioned within the patient's vascular system. The embodiment of IMD 2 shown in FIG. 1 is coupled to two leads <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> implanted within a patient's right ventricle <b>66</b> and within the coronary sinus <b>68</b>, respectively. Leads <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> may carry one or more sensors to provide an indication of performance of the heart <b>4</b>, or any of the biological feedback indicators known in the art. For example, in one preferred embodiment, sensor <b>70</b> is carried on lead <b>62</b> to measure pH and/or blood oxygen levels.</p>
    <p>Lead <b>64</b> is further shown carrying tip electrode <b>72</b> and ring electrode <b>74</b> to delivery pacing pulses and to sense electrical activity within the patient's heart. Alternatively, the electrode <b>72</b> may be positioned in the right atrium to sense atrial activity. This sensed electrical activity may be used by IMD 2 to determine the appropriate drug delivery therapy to be utilized according to the closed-loop mode of operation discussed below.</p>
    <p>It will be appreciated that the afore-mentioned use of the current inventive system is by way of example only, and many therapies may be provided by the inventive drug delivery system. For example, IMD 2 may be useful as a response to ischemic conditions, such that the catheters <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> are placed about the median nerves. Cardiovascular regulation via median nerve stimulation is described, for example, in Li et al., “Reversal of Reflex-Induced Myocardial Ischemia by Median Nerve Stimulation: A Feline Model of Electroacupuncture,” <i>Circulation </i>97(12), pp. 1186-94 (Mar. 31, 1998), hereby incorporated by reference. Finally, while the device <b>2</b> is shown as preferably including two catheters <b>54</b> and <b>56</b>, it is possible that only a single device need be provided.</p>
    <p>FIG. 2 illustrates an alternative embodiment of the present invention wherein the drug delivery catheters are located within the heart or the associated vasculature. In this embodiment, IMD 2 is coupled to two catheters <b>82</b> and <b>84</b> that are drug delivery catheters for delivering biologically-active agents directly to the chambers of the heart. Catheters <b>82</b> and <b>84</b> further are shown to carry electrodes for providing electrical stimulation to the heart that may be performed alone, or in conjunction, with the drug delivery. For example catheter <b>82</b> includes tip and ring electrodes <b>86</b> and <b>88</b>, respectively. In one embodiment, IMD 2 is capable of monitoring various physiological parameters using sensors carried on the body of catheters <b>82</b> and <b>84</b>. For example, cardiac, blood or cardiovascular parameters may be monitored. Changes in CO<sub>2 </sub>or oxygen levels, in pH, the concentration of lactice acid, alpha or beta myosin, catecholamines, endothelin, concentration of various ions such as potassium, calcium, or sodium ions, and/or certain coagulants or anticoagulants are just some of the other parameters that may be monitored. In response to changes in these physiological parameters, various types of drug delivery therapy and/or electrical stimulation may be provided.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, therapy may include delivery of an agent for dissolving a forming blood clot. Such a device may prevent the establishment of a vascular haemorrhage or thrombosis by detecting blood coagulation and thereafter delivery thrombin inhibitors comprising small molecules such as, for example, D/N-methyl-phenylglycyl-Pro-arginal 0.5 mg/kg and/or hirudin 0.25 mg/kg, and/or aspirin 0.02 g or alternatively an inhibitor of factor XIII, such as a derivative of iodacetamide (for example fluoracetamide, 1 mg), or the delivery of a low dose of tPA. Such an inhibition of thrombin may control the tPA potential of the body so that the blood clot is dissolved. This type of therapy may be useful in preventing, or lessening the severity of, a stroke. Such therapies are discussed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,306,293 and 5,305,745 to Zacouto.</p>
    <p>In another embodiment, one or more parameters indicative of cardiac failure may be monitored, with drug therapy being delivered based on a predetermined therapy schedule in response to the detected parameters. Other embodiments and/or uses for this type of system are discussed in the '<b>293</b> and '<b>745</b> patents to Zacouto referenced above.</p>
    <p>Returning to FIG. 2, catheter <b>84</b> is shown to include a ring electrode <b>90</b> that may be used to provide electrical stimulation to the right atrium. Catheter <b>84</b> is further shown to include defibrillation coil electrode <b>92</b> positioned within the coronary sinus for delivering cardioversion and/or defibrillation stimulation to a patient. For example, a cardioversion shock may be delivered between coil electrode <b>92</b> and a second subcutaneous electrode (not shown) implanted below the skin of the patient's chest or back. Alternatively, one or more additional defibrillation electrodes may be carried on either of leads <b>82</b> and <b>84</b> and positioned within the superior vena cava <b>93</b>, and/or the pulmonary artery <b>95</b>,so that a cardioversion/defibrillation pulse may be applied between a predetermined pair of the defibrillation electrodes. Improved implantable atrial defibrillator and lead systems to terminate arrhythmias in this manner are described in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,165,403, 5,292,338, and 5,314,430 incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p>
    <p>According to one embodiment of the invention, drug delivery may be coordinated with the delivery of cardioversion/defibrillation shocks to reduce, or eliminate, the pain associated with this therapy. For example, upon detection of atrial or ventricular fibrillation, IMD <b>2</b> may begin delivery of pain medication in preparation for delivery of the shock. The cardioversion shock is only delivered after sufficient time has elapsed to allow the medication to take effect. Systems of this nature are described in.commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,817,131 to Elsberry entitled “Method and Apparatus for Alleviating Cardioversion Shock Pain”, and in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,893,881 and 5,662,689 both entitled “Method and Apparatus for Alleviating Cardioversion Shock Pain by Delivering a Bolus of Analgesic”, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p>
    <p>In yet another embodiment, drug delivery associated with the delivery of cardioversion/defibrillation shocks delivers biologically-active agents to reduce the defibrillation threshold, as discussed in the '<b>131</b> patent referenced above. An agent such as D-salo-tol, Procainamide or Quinidine may be delivered as an alternative to, or in conjunction with, delivery of the pain alleviating therapies discussed above. The reduction of defibrillation threshold in such a case would provide the possibility of a reduced amplitude, less painful, cardioversion pulse. The delivery of a threshold reducing agent can therefore be employed as a pain alleviating therapy or as part of a pain alleviating therapy. In a more complex embodiment, two separate IMDs employing separate drug delivery devices might be employed to allow delivery of the threshold reducing agent alone or in conjunction with an analgesic. The threshold reducing agent may be delivered systemically, by means of catheters located in a peripheral blood vessel or the pericardial sac or may be retroperfused from the distal coronary sinus.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, drug delivery catheters used to reduce pain during cardioversion/defibrillation may be located in proximity to spinal nerves, as discussed further in conjunction with FIG. <b>3</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 3 illustrates the use of drug delivery catheters located near the region of the T<b>1</b>-T<b>4</b> segments of the spine. The IMD 2 is capable of the sequential intrathecal delivery of a pain alleviating analgesic at therapeutic levels in the region of the T<b>1</b>-T<b>4</b> segments of the spinal cord via one or more catheters <b>96</b>. This drug therapy may be followed by delivery of atrial cardioversion electrical energy pulses or shocks of sufficient amplitude and duration to effectively cardiovert the heart <b>4</b> that has entered atrial fibrillation. This may be accomplished via one or more leads <b>98</b> carrying electrodes positioned in the chambers of the heart or associated vasculature. In another embodiment, the one or more catheters <b>96</b> may be used to deliver pain-relief drugs to this region of the body to alleviate pain that is not associated with a cardioversion shock, or to delivery drugs for reasons other than pain relief.</p>
    <p>FIG. 4 is a plan view illustrating one embodiment of a drug delivery catheter assembly <b>102</b> as may be used in accordance with the present invention. Catheter assembly <b>102</b> includes broadly a catheter <b>104</b> extending from a proximal assembly <b>106</b>. Proximal assembly <b>106</b> includes a handle <b>108</b> to which an electrical connector <b>110</b> is mounted. One or more additional ring connectors may be provided on proximal assembly <b>106</b>, such as ring connectors <b>111</b> and <b>113</b> discussed further below. Catheter may include longitudinally slidable manipulator wire control elements <b>112</b> <i>a </i>and <b>112</b> <i>b </i>and/or a rotatable core wire control element <b>114</b> that are movably mounted to handle <b>108</b> and that may be used to manipulate catheter <b>104</b> as described in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,002,955.</p>
    <p>Catheter <b>104</b> includes a main body portion <b>116</b>, typically about 50 to 100 cm long, and a tip portion <b>118</b>, typically about 5 to 25 cm long. While both main body portion <b>116</b> and tip portion <b>118</b> are flexible, tip portion <b>118</b> may be more flexible than main body portion <b>116</b>. According to the invention, tip portion <b>118</b> includes a controllable drug eluting system to be described further below. Tip portion <b>118</b> may further include an electrode <b>120</b> which may be of any of the electrode configurations known in the art for providing electrical stimulation to body tissue. For example, electrode <b>120</b> may be a porous platinized electrode assembly. In one embodiment of the invention, additional electrodes such as ring electrodes may be provided by tip portion <b>118</b>. In another embodiment, the catheter assembly need not provide any electrodes.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5 is system block diagram of a control circuit <b>200</b> that may be used to deliver drug therapy and/or electrical stimulation to a patient. Control circuit <b>200</b> may be included within any implantable medical device (IMD) known in the art, such as IMD 2 of FIG. <b>1</b>. Control circuit <b>200</b> includes circuitry for delivering electrical stimulation for pacing, cardioversion, and/or defibrillation purposes on electrical stimulation outputs <b>203</b> <i>a </i>and <b>203</b> <i>b</i>. Control circuit may include a communications circuit <b>201</b> such as a telemetry system, counter/timer circuit <b>202</b>, a processing circuit <b>204</b>, and a storage device <b>206</b>. Counter/timer circuit <b>202</b> may be utilized to generate the pacing and/or cardioversion/defibrillation pulses that are delivered via electrical stimulation outputs <b>203</b>. Processing circuit <b>204</b> may be a microprocessor or other processing circuit as is known in the art. Storage device may comprise Random Access Memory (RAM), Read-Only Memory, registers, a combination thereof, or any other type of memory storage device suitable for use in implantable medical devices. Control circuit <b>200</b> may further include an Analog-to-Digital (A-to-D) converter <b>208</b>, which receives input signals from one or more implantable sensors implanted at various locations within a body.</p>
    <p>An IMD used in accordance with the current drug delivery system may also include a drug infusion pump such as pump <b>209</b> coupled to one or more drug delivery catheters such as catheter assembly <b>102</b>. Pump <b>209</b> pumps a biologically-active agent stored within remote storage reservoir <b>213</b> through an inner lumen of catheter <b>102</b> in a manner prescribed by a predetermined drug therapy-regimen. Such a pump may be an implantable drug infusion pump with a programmable flow rate such as the SynchroMed pump commercially available from Medtronic Corporation. The SynchroMed is an internally powered programmable pump having features which allow physicians to change fluid delivery parameters, such as flow rate, infusion period, ramp time, and bolus volume. As an alternative, an implantable pump such as that described in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,820,589, incorporated herein by reference, may be utilized. This alternative design provides a pump that is programmed noninvasively by means of a programmer that communicates flow rate information by means of radio frequency telemetry or other methods of non-invasive telemetry. The programmer also supplies power to the implantable pump during programming so that battery power is not required. An exemplary pump assembly is discussed further below with respect to various embodiments of the current drug delivery system.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, storage reservoir <b>213</b> coupled to the infusion pump may be refillable. For example, IMD 2 may include a port for receiving a syringe. The syringe may be inserted through subcutaneous tissue into the port to refill reservoir when the reservoir become partially or completely empty. An audible or other type of alarm may be provided to notify a patient when the reservoir has reached a predetermined fill level.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5 further shows catheter <b>102</b> coupled to infusion pump <b>209</b>. As illustrated in FIG. 4, catheter <b>102</b> may include one or more electrodes such as electrode <b>120</b>. This electrode is coupled to electrical stimulation output <b>203</b> <i>a </i>that is shown carried on the body of the catheter <b>102</b>. Additional electrodes may be provided by catheter <b>102</b>. The catheter may also carry one or more biological sensors as shown in FIG. <b>2</b>. In this instance, one or more of the sensor inputs <b>210</b> are also coupled to conductors carried by the lead body.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of the invention, the drug delivery system operates in a closed-loop mode wherein one or more physiological signals that are received from one or more of the sensor inputs <b>210</b> triggers the delivery of biologically-active agents to a patient. In this mode, one or more physiological signal may be amplified by amplifier circuit <b>212</b>, converted to digital format by A-to-D converter <b>208</b>, and provided to processing circuit <b>204</b>. Operating under software and/or hardware control, processing circuit analyzes the received signal(s) to determine a course of action. Based on this analysis, processing circuit may provide a predetermined address on bus <b>214</b> to decode circuit <b>216</b>, which may be a demultiplexer. This, in turn, causes decode circuit <b>216</b> to drive one or more control signals shown as control lines <b>218</b>, <b>220</b>, and <b>222</b>, which are normally in a high-impedance state. These control lines, which may extend to distal tip <b>118</b> of catheter <b>102</b>, control the delivery of biologically-active agents according to the current invention. This will be discussed below in detail.</p>
    <p>In the closed-loop system discussed above, many different biological signals may be monitored on sensor input(s) <b>210</b>. For example, implanted sensors (not shown in FIG. 5) may monitor a patient's electrocardiam signals to detect a heart rate that is irregular, or that is too fast or too slow. Pressure, temperature, flow rate, motion, and/or activity sensors located within the heart or other areas of the body may monitor other physiological conditions. Still other sensors may be utilized to monitor a patient's blood chemistry to detect variations in hormone or other chemical levels, for example. This is discussed above in regards to the '293 and '745 patents to Zacouto. Processing circuit <b>204</b> may be programmed to respond to one or more trigger events sensed by the one or more sensors to active drug delivery and/or electrical stimulation in the manner discussed above.</p>
    <p>In another embodiment of the invention, drug delivery may be performed in an open-loop manner that does not depend on bio-feedback. For example, counter/timer circuit <b>202</b> may be utilized to trigger drug delivery based on a programmed pre-selected time interval. Alternatively, an external programming circuit <b>230</b> may be used to initiate drug delivery via a communication with communication circuit <b>201</b> for example.</p>
    <heading>Drug Delivery Control Systems According to the Current Invention</heading> <p>As discussed above, the present invention provides an IMD that is adapted to controllably deliver biologically-active agents to a body. The IMD is coupled to a drug delivery catheter that may take the form of one of the embodiments discussed in the following paragraphs.</p>
    <p>FIG. 6 is a side cutaway view of tip portion <b>118</b> of catheter assembly <b>102</b> according to one embodiment of the current invention. In this embodiment, catheter assembly <b>102</b> includes a central lumen <b>250</b> that extends to electrode <b>120</b>. Central lumen <b>250</b> carries a conductor <b>252</b> that couples electrode to connector <b>110</b> (FIG. <b>4</b>). This conductor may be a coiled conductor, or a single or multi-filar stranded conductor of any of the configurations known in the art.</p>
    <p>Central lumen <b>250</b> is defined by outer jacket <b>256</b> that may be formed of any biocompatible material that may be etched, such as polyethylene glycol or polytetrfluroethylene (PTFE) or a similar material. The outer jacket may be treated with a material to prevent tissue in-growth. For example, the outer jacket may be coated with a porous Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) layer such as may be formed of expanded PTFE (e-PTFE) having a pore size of less than 10 microns or smaller. This is described in U.S. Pat. 5,609,622.</p>
    <p>In this embodiment, etching of the jacket may be performed to create local reservoirs <b>260</b> and <b>262</b> which are each local to a respective drug delivery port. Although only two reservoirs are shown in the current example, any number of reservoirs may be provided on tip portion <b>118</b>, and/or on body portion <b>116</b> of catheter assembly <b>102</b>. Etching of the jacket may be accomplished using a chemical surface modification process, such as an etching process commercially performed by the Zeus Corporation, or, alternatively, by using a plasma or corona etching process. Reservoirs may be formed in any shape and depth that can be accommodated by the size of the tip portion <b>118</b> of catheter assembly.</p>
    <p>Reservoirs <b>260</b> and <b>262</b> are filled with biologically-active compounds shown as compounds <b>264</b> and <b>266</b>, respectively. Each of the reservoirs may be filled with the same, or a different, compound. Biologically-active compounds may include, but are not limited to, prodrugs, antisense, oligonucleotides, DNA, antibodies, vaccines, other recombinant proteins, anti-ADS substances, anti-cancer substances, antibiotics, immunosuppressants (e.g. cyclosporine) anti-viral substances, enzyme inhibitors, neurotoxins, opioids, hypnotics, antihistamines, lubricants tranquilizers, anti-convulsants, muscle relaxants and anti-Parkinson substances, anti-spasmodics and muscle contractants, miotics and anti-cholinergics, antiglaucoma compounds, anti-parasite and/or ant-iprotozoal compounds, anti-hypertensives, analgesics, anti-pyretics and anti-inflammatory agents such as NSAIDs, local anesthetics, ophthalmics, prostaglandins, anti-depressants, anti-psychotic substances; antiemetics, imaging agents, specific targeting agents, neurotransmitters, proteins, cell response modifiers, and vaccines. Other biologically-active compounds may include analgesics, anesthetics, spinal opiates, drugs adapted to increase the efficacy of defibrillation pulses or to reduce defibrillation thresholds such as D-solotal, Procainamide, or Quinidine, anti-seizure drugs, or any other biologically-active compound for which controlled, remote delivery may be applicable.</p>
    <p>The biologically-active agents may be deposited within reservoirs using an injection process. The agents may be deposited in a pure form, such as a liquid solution or gel. Alternatively, these agents may be encapsulated within, or by, a release system. Use of a release system may be necessary to control the rate at which the biologically-active agents are released into the body. In this case, selection of the release system is dependent on the desired rate of release of the molecules. Both non-degradable and degradable release systems can be used for delivery of molecules. Suitable release systems include polymers and polymeric matrices, non-polymeric matrices, or inorganic and organic excipients and diluents such as, but not limited to, calcium carbonate and sugar. Release systems may be natural or synthetic, although synthetic release systems are preferred due to the better characterization of release profiles. The release system is selected based on the period over which release is desired, generally in the range of at least three to twelve months for in vivo applications. In contrast, release times as short as a few seconds may be desirable for some in vitro applications. In some cases, continuous (constant) release from a reservoir may be most useful. A further description of release systems is provided in U.S. Pat. No. 5,797,898 to Santini, Jr. et al entitled “Microchip Drug Delivery Devices”, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
    <p>After the biologically-active agents are deposited within the reservoirs of the catheter assembly <b>102</b>, reservoir cap members <b>270</b> and <b>272</b> are deposited over each of the reservoirs <b>260</b> and <b>262</b>, respectively. Reservoir caps prevent the biologically-active agents from being released by the reservoirs until the selectable release is desired, as controlled by a control circuit to be discussed below. In one embodiment, each of the reservoir caps consists of thin films of conductive material sized to cover the respective reservoir, as shown by reservoir cap <b>270</b>. In another embodiment, the thin film may extend beyond the edge of the reservoirs to partially cover the non-etched portion of jacket <b>256</b>, as shown by reservoir cap <b>272</b>. Any conductive material that can oxidize, is biocompatible and bio-absorbable, and that may be dissolved in solution such as blood upon application of an electric potential can be used for the fabrication of the anodes and cathodes. Examples of such materials include copper, gold, silver, and zinc, and some polymers, as described, for example, by I. C. Kwon et al., Electrically erodible polymer gel for controlled release of drugs”, Nature, 1991, 354, 291-93; and Y. H. Bae et al., “Pulsatile drug release by electric stimulus”, ACS Symposium Series, 1994, 545, 98-110.</p>
    <p>Reservoir caps may be formed by injection or spin coating. Alternatively, each reservoir can be capped individually by capillary action, by drawing the material into the reservoir with a vacuum or other pressure gradient, by melting the material into the reservoir, by centrifugation and related processes, by inserting solids into the reservoir, or by any combination of these or similar methods.</p>
    <p>Each of the reservoir caps is electrically and mechanically coupled to a respective conductor, which may be a wire. These conductors, which will be referred to as anode connectors for reasons to be discussed.below, are shown as conductors <b>280</b> and <b>282</b> of FIG. <b>6</b>. These conductors <b>280</b> and <b>282</b> extend to the proximal assembly <b>106</b> to couple to a respective one of ring connectors <b>111</b> and <b>113</b> of FIG. <b>4</b>. In one embodiment, each of the reservoir caps is coupled to a different one of the ring connectors. In an alternative embodiment, one or more reservoir caps may be electrically coupled to the same ring connector.</p>
    <p>In addition to the conductors that are electrically coupled to the reservoir caps, additional “cathode” conductors are provided for each of the reservoirs. Each of these additional cathode conductors, shown in cross-section as conductors <b>284</b> and <b>286</b>, are located adjacent to, but electrically and mechanically isolated from, a respective reservoir. The manner in which cathode conductors are routed is discussed below. Each of the cathode conductors is coupled to a respective connector on proximal assembly so as to form a complete circuit when a voltage difference is generated between the anode and the cathode conductors, and the cap member is placed in a conductive solution, as is discussed further below.</p>
    <p>After conductors <b>280</b>, <b>282</b>, <b>284</b>, and <b>286</b> are routed on an outer surface of jacket <b>256</b>, an additional layer <b>290</b> of bio-compatible material may be provided.over a predetermined portion of jacket to cover portions of the conductors and hold them in place, but allowing the reservoir caps <b>270</b> and <b>272</b> and at least a portion of each cathode conductor to remain exposed. A layer of silicone may be extruded over parts of the main body portion <b>116</b> and tip portion <b>118</b>, for example. Alternatively, an additional layer of PTFE may be deposited over jacket <b>256</b> and the conductors at selected locations.</p>
    <p>As discussed above, each of the anode and cathode conductor pairs such as conductors <b>280</b> and <b>284</b> are adapted to form a circuit. This circuit is closed when the catheter is placed in a conductive solution such as blood or other bodily fluids. A voltage potential created between an anode conductor and a respective cathode conductor causes electrons to pass from the anode conductor to the cathode conductor through the conductive solution. This, in turn, causes the reservoir cap, which may be considered the anode of the circuit, to oxidize and dissolve into the surrounding fluids, exposing the biologically-reactive agent to surrounding body fluids for delivery.</p>
    <p>The control of the conductor pairs via IMD 2 can be understood more clearly by returning to FIG. <b>5</b>. Each of the conductor pairs <b>218</b>, <b>220</b> and <b>222</b> of FIG. 5 are shown being carried by catheter <b>102</b>, although it will be understood that some of the conductor pairs may be coupled to one or more additional catheters. Each of these conductor pairs corresponds with a respective reservoir in the manner discussed above. For example, conductor pair <b>218</b> of FIG. 5 may correspond to conductors <b>280</b> and <b>284</b>, and reservoir <b>260</b> of FIG. <b>6</b>. Fewer or more conductor pairs may be provided depending on the selected application. Processing circuit <b>204</b> provides a selected combination of signals on bus <b>214</b> to demultiplexer <b>216</b> to cause a voltage to be applied across a selected one of these conductor pairs. This results in a selected one of the reservoir caps being dissolved to release a desired biologically-active agent into the body. In one embodiment, processing circuit may cause decode circuit <b>216</b> to drive multiple conductor pairs in parallel or in sequence in response to sensor input so that multiple biological agents are released.</p>
    <p>FIG. 7 is a top plan view of tip portion <b>118</b> of catheter assembly <b>102</b> illustrating reservoir cap <b>270</b> and the associated conductors before any additional layer <b>290</b> of biocompatible material is applied to the catheter assembly. This view shows the manner in which wire <b>284</b>, which serves as the-cathode conductor, is adjacent to, but electrically isolated from, reservoir <b>270</b>. Wire <b>280</b> is mechanically and electrically coupled to reservoir <b>270</b> in the manner discussed above.</p>
    <p>The foregoing example discusses an embodiment wherein the anode and cathode conductors are provided external to jacket <b>256</b>. In another embodiment, these conductors may be provided within inner lumens of the catheter assembly <b>102</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 8 is a side cutaway view of an alternative embodiment of the inventive catheter assembly. In this embodiment, jacket <b>256</b> <i>a</i>, which may be formed of PTFE or other bio-compatible material, surrounds an inner tubular member <b>300</b>, which may be formed of silicone, for example. Tubular member is formed to define reservoir <b>260</b> <i>a</i>, which is filled with a selected biologically-active agent. Reservoir <b>260</b> <i>a </i>is capped by reservoir cap <b>270</b> <i>a </i>formed in an etched or cutaway region of jacket <b>256</b> <i>a </i>using any of the methods and materials discussed above. Reservoir cap <b>270</b> <i>a </i>is coupled to anode conductor <b>280</b> <i>a</i>, which is embedded within tubular member <b>300</b>. Cathode conductor <b>284</b> <i>a </i>is also embedded within tubular member, and extends through jacket <b>256</b> <i>a </i>via an opening in the jacket as may be formed by etching, or cutting away, a portion of jacket <b>256</b> <i>a</i>. Cathode conductor <b>284</b> <i>a </i>is proximate to reservoir cap in a manner similar to that shown in FIG. 7 discussed above. In this embodiment, anode and cathode conductors <b>280</b> <i>a </i>and <b>284</b> <i>a</i>, respectively, may take the form of insulated wires. In one embodiment, these wires may comprise a twisted pair of wires.</p>
    <p>FIG. 8 further shows conductor <b>252</b> embedded within tubular member <b>300</b> and coupled to electrode <b>120</b>. In yet another embodiment, tubular member may include one or more inner lumens to carry one or more of the conductors. For example, a first lumen may be provided to carry conductor <b>252</b>, and a second lumen may be provided to carry a twisted pair of conductors <b>280</b> <i>a </i>and <b>284</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p>As the number of reservoirs (and conductors) increases, the required number of mutually insulated conductors within the lead body correspondingly increases. Additional embodiments of the lead may include embedding multiple conductors within the wall of an insulative lead body, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,968,087 issued to Hess, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,016,646 issued to Gotthardt, et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,845,396 issued to Altman et al. An additional alternative approach is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,935,159 issued to Cross et al, in which individual conductors are separated from one another by means of a central strut having laterally extending projections, serving to space and insulate adjacent conductors from one another, within a tubular outer sheath. Yet another approach is described below with respect to FIG. 16, and involves the use of a selection control circuit to selectably enable one or more of the multiple conductor pairs.</p>
    <p>The foregoing embodiments of the inventive catheter assembly selectably release biologically-active agents by programmably causing the ionization of one or more conductive membranes. In another embodiment of the invention, the selectable release of biologically-active agents is triggered using a permanently cross-linked polymer gel of the type described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,651,979 and 5,876,741 incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. These polymer gels exhibit a reversible volume change when exposed to external environmental conditions. Of particular interest are known cross-linked polymer gels that swell to up to 300% of their volume when exposed to an electric field. Ones of these gels are biologically compatible, and are therefore suitable for use within implantable medical devices. For a more complete description of cross-linked polymer gels, see, for example, Tanaka Phys. Rev. Lett. 40(820), 1978; Tanaka et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 38(771), 1977; Tanaka et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 45(1636), 1980; llavsky, Macromolec. 15(782), 1982; Hrouz et al., Europ. Polym. J. 17, p361, 1981; Ohmine et al., J. Chem. Phys. 8(6379), 1984; Tanaka et al., Science 218(462), 1982; llavsky et al., Polymer Bull. 7(107), 1982; Gehrke “Responsive Gels:, Volume Transitions II”, Dusek (ed.), Springer-Verlag, New York, p81-144, 1993; Liet al., Ann.

    <p>Preferred responsive polymer gel network materials include polysaccharide chains cross-linked with a multifunctional carboxylic add obtainable from an acyl halide derivative of the acid. The preferred polymer chains are polysaccharides (e.g., starch or cellulose ethers) and the preferred multifunctional carboxylic acid is selected from the group consisting of adipic acid, sebacic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, 1, 2, 3, 4-butanetetracarboxylic acid, and 1, 10 decanedicarboxylic acid. Particularly preferred polymers are cellulose ethers selected from the group consisting of hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose. It is preferred that the gel exhibits substantially pressure independent volume changes at hydrostatic pressures in the range of 0.30-1.3 atmospheres. Methods of making cross-linked polymer networks are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5,651,979 references above.</p>
    <p>FIG. 9 is a side cutaway view of another embodiment of tip portion <b>118</b> of catheter assembly <b>2</b> which includes a cross-linked polymer gel of the type disclosed above to facilitate selectable delivery of biologically-active agents to a patient. Tip portion <b>118</b> includes an outer jacket <b>256</b> <i>c</i>, which may be of any of the constructions discussed above. Jacket <b>256</b> <i>c </i>surrounds a tubular member <b>300</b> <i>c </i>that may be formed of silicone, for example. Jacket <b>256</b> <i>c </i>includes a porous portion <b>348</b> containing one or more micropores <b>350</b> that are in fluid communication with reservoir <b>352</b>. Porous portion of jacket <b>256</b> <i>c </i>may be formed of a microporous structure such as porous Polytefrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which may be an expanded PTFE (e-PTFE). Alternatively, porous portion <b>348</b> may be created by puncturing jacket <b>256</b> <i>c </i>at predetermined locations to create openings of a desired size and shape.</p>
    <p>Porous portion <b>348</b> provides one or more sides of reservoir <b>352</b>, which may contain any of the biologically-active agents discussed above, either in a pure gel, solid, or liquid form, or incorporated into a release system so that time-release of the agent may be possible. At least one wall of reservoir <b>352</b> is provided by a movable member <b>354</b>, which in this embodiment slidably engages with walls <b>356</b> <i>a </i>and <b>356</b> <i>b </i>of reservoir <b>352</b>. Movable member <b>354</b> is in communication with a second reservoir <b>358</b> that contains-one of the biologically-compatible cross-linked polymer gels discussed above that is responsive to electrical fields.</p>
    <p>On at least two opposing sides of reservoir <b>358</b> is provided conductive members <b>360</b> and <b>362</b>, each coupled to a respective one of conductors <b>364</b> and <b>366</b>. Conductors <b>364</b> and <b>366</b> may be insulated wires as shown in FIG. <b>9</b>. The conductive members may be embedded in tubular member <b>300</b> <i>c</i>, or alternatively may-be carried by an internal lumen provided within tubular member <b>300</b> <i>c</i>. A voltage potential applied between conductors <b>364</b> and <b>366</b> creates an electric field as indicated by arrow <b>370</b>, causing the gel contained in reservoir <b>358</b> to swell. This, in turn, exerts a force against movable member <b>354</b>, which pressurizes the biologically-active agent, dilating the pores <b>350</b> to release the biologically-active agent resident in reservoir <b>352</b>. When a voltage difference between the conductor pairs <b>364</b> and <b>366</b> is no longer present, the gel resumes the original volume so that an agent resident in reservoir <b>352</b> is no longer forced through the micropores. It may be noted that in this embodiment, generation of the electric field across reservoir <b>358</b> involves little or no current drain, making this embodiment attractive for use in an implantable medical device.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of the invention, catheter assembly <b>102</b> includes a lumen <b>371</b> in fluid communication with remote storage reservoir <b>213</b> coupled to infusion pump <b>209</b> of FIG. <b>5</b>.</p>
    <p>In an embodiment including a pump, a liquid biologically-active agent may be pumped into reservoir <b>352</b> via a one-way valve <b>372</b>, as indicated by arrow <b>374</b>. Pressure created in lumen <b>370</b> by the activation of the pump opens the one-way value <b>372</b> to infuse an agent into reservoir <b>352</b>. One-way valve then closes when the pump is de-activated. This provides a mechanism to re-fill reservoir <b>352</b> with an additional amount of a selected agent. In a preferred embodiment, pump is activated when gel in reservoir <b>358</b> is in the unexpanded state. A sensor may be provided in communication with reservoir <b>352</b> to indicate when the reservoir is empty.</p>
    <p>FIG. 10 is a side cutaway view of another embodiment of the inventive system that includes a cross-linked polymer gel to facilitate selectable drug delivery. In this embodiment, jacket <b>256</b> <i>c </i>defines an inner space that includes a flexible member <b>380</b>. Flexible member may extend within tip portion <b>118</b>, and may further extend within all, or a portion of, body portion <b>116</b>. Flexible member defines one or more walls of reservoir <b>382</b>, which is filled with a cross-linked polymer gel. In this embodiment, catheter assembly further includes a lumen <b>392</b> extending from porous portion <b>348</b> to the proximal assembly <b>106</b>, which is coupled to infusion pump <b>209</b> (FIG. <b>5</b>). Pump assembly includes a pump control circuit <b>396</b> coupled to reservoir <b>213</b>. This pump may operate as described in U.S. Pat. 5,820,589 referenced above.</p>
    <p>In the embodiment of FIG. 10, drug delivery is accomplished when the gel in an unexpanded state within reservoir <b>213</b>. Infusion pump <b>209</b> is activated to deliver biologically-active agent within reservoir <b>213</b> to lumen <b>392</b>. Pressure created within lumen <b>392</b> by operation of the pump forces the agent from pores <b>350</b>. To disable the delivery of the agent, the pump is turned off, and an electric field is created across reservoir <b>382</b>. This causes the cross-linked polymer gel in reservoir <b>382</b> to expand, forcing the flexible member <b>380</b> to collapse against porous portion <b>348</b> so that delivery of an agent within lumen <b>392</b> is interrupted.</p>
    <p>FIG. 11 is a cross-sectional view of the catheter assembly of FIG. 10 at line <b>11</b>—<b>11</b> illustrating operation of the system when the polymer gel is in a non-expanded state. Lumen <b>392</b>, which is partially defined by flexible member <b>380</b>, is open to allow the flow of biologically-active agents to pores <b>350</b> under pressure developed by the infusion pump <b>209</b>. This view shows conductors <b>410</b> and <b>412</b> embedded within jacket <b>256</b> <i>c</i>. These conductors extend to a control circuit such as shown in FIG. 5 located in IMD 2. For example, all of conductors <b>410</b> may be electrically coupled to one another, and to one of the conductors included in a conductor pair of FIG. <b>5</b>. Likewise, conductors <b>412</b> may all be electrically coupled to one another, and to the other conductor in the same conductor pair. Thus, by selectively activating a predetermined one of the conductor pairs shown as <b>218</b>, <b>220</b>, and <b>222</b> of FIG. 5, the electrical field may be generated across the polymer gel, as discussed below.</p>
    <p>FIG. 12 is a cross-sectional view of the catheter assembly of FIG. 10 at line <b>11</b>—<b>11</b> illustrating operation of the system when the polymer gel is in an expanded state. The polymer gel expands in response to the electric field created by a voltage potential difference existing between conductors <b>410</b> and <b>412</b>, as shown by arrow <b>414</b>. This forces flexible member <b>380</b> to collapse against pores <b>350</b>, interrupting the delivery of an agent present within lumen <b>392</b>. In the preferred embodiment, when the electric field is generated, infusion pump <b>209</b> is turned off.</p>
    <p>As noted above, the inventive catheter system may be used in any application wherein the controlled delivery of biologically-active agents to a body is desirable. In one embodiment, multiple ones of the inventive catheters may be used to deliver biologically-active agents to predetermined nerves in a patient's body to control the rate of a patient's heart.</p>
    <p>FIG. 13 is a top view of yet another embodiment of a catheter for use in selectably delivering biologically-active agents using polymer gels. FIG. 13 illustrates tip portion <b>118</b> of the catheter assembly, including an electrode <b>120</b>. Catheter includes one or more apertures such as aperture <b>420</b>. Aligned with aperture and embedded within the wall of the catheter is a disk member <b>422</b> (shown dashed). The disk is defined by a flexible, expandable material which is shaped like “donut”. The disk is filled with a polymer gel that expands when placed in an electrical field, as discussed above. A pair of conductors <b>424</b> and <b>426</b> (shown dashed) are also embedded within the wall of the catheter, and are positioned so that an electrical field may be generated across disk <b>422</b> to control expansion of the polymer gel contained by the disk. This expansion thereby prevents the biologically-active agent from exiting the catheter via aperture <b>420</b>. Because the embodiment of FIG. 13 provides a mechanism to close the aperture <b>420</b>, this embodiment has the advantage of prevent the ingress of body fluids into the catheter. For example, the closure of the disk aperture prevents the ingress of blood which could subsequently form clots, preventing further use of aperture <b>420</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 14A is a top plan view of disk <b>422</b> when the polymer gel contained by the disk is not located within an electrical field. Because the polymer gel is not in the electrical field, the gel contracts, allowing aperture <b>430</b> to open and provide a passage for the delivery of a drug bolus.</p>
    <p>FIG. 14B is a top plan view of disk <b>422</b> when the polymer gel contained by the disk is located within an electrical field, causing the gel to expand so that aperture <b>430</b> is closed.</p>
    <p>FIG. 14C is a side plan view of disk <b>422</b> when the disk is in either the expanded or contracted state. It may be noted that to prevent the overall size of the disk from expanding when the polymer gel expands, the outer walls of the disk may be made of a material that is more rigid than the inner walls of the disk that surround the aperture. Both the inner and outer walls may be made of a material such as rubber selected to have a desired stiffness, for example.</p>
    <p>FIG. 15 is a side cutaway view of the embodiment of catheter of FIG. 13 along line <b>15</b>—<b>15</b>. This view illustrates jacket <b>256</b> <i>d</i>, which may be formed of a polymer or silicon, forming the walls of catheter in the manner discussed above. This view further illustrates inner lumen <b>432</b> that is in fluid communication with a reservoir (FIG. 5) for storing biologically-active agents. When an infusion pump is activated, the biologically-active agents are pumped into lumen in the manner shown by arrow <b>434</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 15 illustrates the manner in which disk <b>422</b> is embedded within the wall of the catheter. In this view, disk <b>422</b> is in an expanded state so that aperture <b>430</b> is closed. As discussed above, the expansion is causes by the generation of an electrical field between conductors <b>424</b> and <b>426</b>. When in the expanded state, disk <b>422</b> prevents the biologically-active agents contained in inner lumen <b>432</b> from exiting catheter lumen <b>420</b>.</p>
    <p>The catheter of the present embodiment may include multiple apertures within the catheter wall in tip portion <b>118</b>, and/or in the body portion <b>116</b>, of the catheter assembly. As with any of the embodiments described above, these apertures may be staggered around the circumference of the catheter to ensure that one of the apertures is always available to perform drug delivery regardless of the manner in which the catheter is positioned within the body. For example, in some instances, one or more of the apertures may be blocked because of close contact with body tissue. By providing multiple apertures at various staggered locations around the body of the catheter, it is more likely one of the apertures will not be blocked, and will be available to deliver the biologically-active agents. For example, FIG. 15 illustrates a second aperture <b>440</b> aligned with disk <b>442</b>. Disk <b>442</b> is in an unexpanded state because no electrical field is being generated between conductors <b>444</b> and <b>446</b>. As such, the material within lumen <b>432</b>, which is under pressure because of the operation of infusion pump <b>209</b>, is allowed to exit aperture <b>440</b>.</p>
    <p>In any of the embodiments of the drug infusion catheter discussed above, the pores or apertures through which the drugs are delivered may be a varying sizes. By selectably controlling drug delivery through one or more apertures of differing sizes, a precise, selectable quantity of a drug may be delivered to the body. In one embodiment, a catheter may include multiple apertures, wherein ones of the apertures have a cross-sectional area that is twice the size of a respective other one of the apertures. In this manner, the apertures may comprise a binary-sized array. A control circuit may be provided in IMD 2 that is similar to decode circuit <b>216</b> that allows a predetermined combination of apertures to be activated to deliver a precise dosage of a biologically-active agent to a patient's body.</p>
    <p>FIG. 16 is a top plan view of a distal portion of a catheter body including a binary array of apertures. Each of the apertures may be controlled in a manner similar to that described with respect to the disk members of FIGS. 13 and 15, or using any of the other control mechanisms discussed above. Although only four apertures are shown in FIG. 16, it is understood fewer, or more, than the number of apertures shown may be used in this embodiment. Aperture <b>450</b> has a cross-sectional area that is twice as large as aperture <b>452</b>, which has a cross-sectional area that is twice as large as aperture <b>454</b>, which, in turn, has a cross-sectional area that is twice as large as aperture <b>456</b>. Although this type of array is shown for use with a catheter that utilizes a cross-linked polymer gel, it is understood this type of array could be included in any of the embodiments of the current invention, including those embodiments that utilize a dissolvable conductive cap member to selectively accomplish drug delivery. U.S. Pat. No. 5,368,704 entitled “Micro-electrochemical Valves and Method” discloses a binary valve configuration for controlling flow in a precise manner such as controlled by the aperture array of the embodiment shown in FIG. <b>16</b>.</p>
    <p>In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 16, each of the apertures is associated with a respective pair of conductors (shown dashed) to provide individual control of the flow through the associated aperture. For example, the regulation of the flow through aperture <b>450</b> is controlled by conductors <b>458</b> and <b>460</b> in a manner similar to that discussed above with respect to FIG. <b>15</b>. Each of the conductor pairs may extend to the proximal end of the catheter assembly in the manner described above. However, as the number of conductor pairs increases, an alternative conductor configuration as shown in FIG. 16 may be more desirable. According to this aspect of the invention, a control circuit <b>462</b> may be included at a location within main body portion II <b>6</b> or tip portion <b>118</b> of the catheter assembly. A single pair of conductors <b>464</b> and <b>466</b> extends from control circuit <b>462</b> to the proximal end of the catheter assembly, and may be driven by a circuit in IMD 2. That is, a voltage potential difference is provided on lines <b>464</b> and <b>466</b> to control circuit <b>462</b>. The control circuit then transfers the potential difference to one or more of the conductor pairs at its output as determined by a set of control lines <b>468</b> which may also be driven by IMD 2. In one embodiment, control circuit <b>462</b> is a multiplexer for driving a predetermined one of the conductor pairs at a time. In this embodiment, the multiplexer may be controlled to sequentially enable predetermined ones of the conductor pairs, and to thereby deliver the desired drug dosage to a patient. In another embodiment, control circuit may be a combinational logic circuit capable of enabling predetermined multiple ones of the conductor pairs in parallel. In either case, the use of the control circuit eliminates the need to have all of the conductors in the conductor pairs extend to the proximal end of the catheter assembly. The catheter assembly may therefore be reduced in size. This type of control circuit may be readily incorporated into any of the embodiments of the invention described herein.</p>
    <p>Although for ease of illustrate, the embodiment of FIG. 16 depicts the apertures substantially aligned, it may be preferable to stagger the apertures around the circumference of the catheter. This arrangement minimizes the generation of unintentional electric fields in the vicinity of one or more of the apertures as a result of the existence of potential differences generated in conductor pairs associated with other ones of the apertures.</p>
    <p>Although use of the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes can be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the current drug delivery system may further include any of the aspects of the system described in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,178,349 issued Jan. 23, 2001 entitled “Drug Delivery Neural Stimulation Device for Treatment of Cardiovascular Disorders” incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
