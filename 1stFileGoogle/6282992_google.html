    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>The present invention relates to a biasing arrangement for a pawl of a reversible ratchet-type wrench to provide reliable ratcheting. The present invention also relates to an improved head structure for a ratchet-type wrench to lower the manufacture cost.</p>
    <p>2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p>U.S. Pat. No. 2,957,377 issued to Hare on Oct. 25, 1960 discloses a reversible ratchet type wrench comprising a body <b>10</b> having a handle <b>11</b> and a head <b>12</b>. A cap <b>39</b> and an annular wall <b>44</b> are provided to upper side and lower side of the head <b>12</b>, respectively. Yet, this increases the assembly time and the manufacture cost and adversely affects the appearance. A shifting lever <b>35</b> is retained in place by a spring <b>33</b> that is located in a cylindrical opening <b>34</b>. Nevertheless, formation of the cylindrical opening <b>34</b> that extends upward at an incline is relatively difficult. In addition, formation of the cavity <b>16</b> having converging straight sides <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> which diverge in the direction of the periphery of rotatable member <b>14</b> requires expensive and accurate computer-numeric-control (CNC), which further results in an increase in the cost together with a low production rate. This is why such a reversible ratchet type wrench is hardly seen in the market.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 10 and 11 illustrate another conventional ratchet type wrench comprising a handle <b>12</b>′ and a head <b>11</b>′. The head <b>11</b>′ is machined to form four consecutive compartments for receiving the drive member <b>20</b>′, the pawl <b>30</b>′ and the shifting lever <b>40</b>′, wherein three of the compartments can be formed by cutting, yet the remaining one must be machined by CNC. Further, the resultant head structure is relatively weak and thus has a poor torque-bearing capacity. In addition, the movement of the pawl <b>30</b>′ for changing ratcheting direction is found unreliable, as it is achieved via transmission of the hook end <b>442</b>′ of a spring <b>44</b>′ attached to the shifting lever <b>40</b>′.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p>Referring to FIGS. 1 through 9 and initially to FIGS. 1, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>6</b>, a ratchet-type wrench <b>10</b> in accordance with the present invention generally includes a handle <b>12</b> and a head <b>11</b> having a hole <b>13</b>. An inner periphery <b>132</b> defining the hole <b>13</b> of the head <b>11</b> includes an annular groove <b>131</b> in a lower portion thereof. A web <b>17</b> is defined between the head <b>11</b> and the handle <b>12</b>. A cavity <b>14</b> is defined in the web <b>17</b>. Also defined in the web <b>17</b> is a compartment <b>15</b> that is substantially L-shape and includes an inner end communicated with the cavity <b>14</b> and an outer end communicated with outside, thereby leaving a bridge <b>16</b> on the web <b>17</b>. The outer end of the compartment <b>15</b> is preferably circular. The bridge <b>16</b> increases the strength of the head <b>11</b> and the handle <b>12</b>, thereby providing a higher torque-bearing capacity.</p>
    <p>A drive member (in the form of a gear wheel <b>20</b> in this embodiment) is mounted in the head <b>11</b> and includes an inner periphery <b>24</b> for driving a fastener (not shown) and an outer periphery <b>25</b>. The outer periphery <b>25</b> includes a recessed upper end portion <b>22</b>, a lower end portion <b>23</b>, and a middle portion with a plurality of recessed teeth <b>21</b>. The lower end portion <b>23</b> includes an annular groove <b>231</b>. A C-clip <b>30</b> is received in the annular groove <b>231</b> of the lower end portion <b>23</b> and the annular groove <b>131</b> of the head <b>11</b>, thereby rotatably retaining the gear wheel <b>20</b> in the head <b>11</b> of the wrench <b>10</b>, best shown in FIG. <b>2</b>.</p>
    <p>A pawl <b>40</b> is mounted in cavity <b>14</b> in the web <b>17</b> and includes ratchet teeth <b>41</b> on a side thereof for engaging with teeth <b>21</b> of the gear wheel <b>20</b>. The other side of the pawl <b>40</b> further includes a recess <b>42</b> having two ends <b>421</b> and <b>422</b>, which will be described later.</p>
    <p>Still referring to FIGS. 1 through 3, a switch member <b>50</b> is rotatably mounted to the second end of the compartment <b>15</b>. In this embodiment, the switch member <b>50</b> includes a turn-piece <b>51</b> outside the compartment <b>15</b> for manual operation and an actuating plate <b>52</b> extended from the turn-piece <b>51</b> and having a receptacle <b>521</b> that faces the cavity <b>14</b>. A biasing means <b>60</b> is mounted in the receptacle <b>521</b> and includes an elastic element <b>62</b> and a peg <b>61</b>. In this embodiment as illustrated in FIG. 2, the elastic element <b>62</b> includes a first end <b>621</b> configured to bias an end <b>612</b> of the peg <b>61</b>. A second end <b>622</b> of the elastic element <b>62</b> is configured to have a larger diameter so as to bear against and thus be attached to the actuating plate <b>52</b> in an area surrounding an opening section (not labeled) of the receptacle <b>521</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>3</b>.</p>
    <p>In assembly, the switch member <b>50</b> is mounted in the compartment <b>15</b> and the biasing means <b>60</b> is mounted into the receptacle <b>521</b> of the switch member <b>50</b> via the cavity <b>14</b> with the elastic element <b>62</b> surrounding a part of the peg <b>61</b>. The end <b>612</b> of the peg <b>61</b> bears against the first end <b>621</b> of the elastic element <b>62</b>. The pawl <b>40</b> is mounted into the cavity <b>14</b> with the other end <b>611</b> of the peg <b>61</b> extended into the recess <b>42</b> of the pawl <b>40</b>. The C-clip <b>30</b> is placed into the hole <b>13</b> and the gear wheel <b>20</b> is then mounted in the hole <b>13</b> with the C-clip <b>30</b> received in the annular grooves <b>131</b> and <b>231</b>, thereby completing the assembly. Thus, the assembly procedure is simple and can be accomplished quickly by a C-clip <b>30</b> without the aid of any screw or cover.</p>
    <p>The ratchet-type wrench in FIG. 3 is in a status allowing counterclockwise ratcheting (free rotation in clockwise direction), in which the other end <b>611</b> of the peg <b>61</b> bears against an end <b>422</b> of the recess <b>42</b> of the pawl <b>40</b>, and an end <b>44</b> of the pawl <b>40</b> bears against a wall portion defining the cavity <b>14</b>. When a change in the ratcheting direction is required, the user may switch the turn-piece <b>51</b> and thus cause the biasing means <b>60</b> to move. FIG. 4 shows a transition position for the ratchet-type wrench that allows free rotation in both directions. As illustrated in FIG. 4, the elastic element <b>62</b> is stretched during rotational movement of the turn-piece. When the turn-piece <b>51</b> reaches its predetermined position shown in FIG. 5, the other end <b>611</b> of the peg <b>61</b> bears against the other end <b>421</b> of the recess <b>42</b> of the pawl <b>40</b>, and the other end <b>43</b> of the pawl <b>40</b> bears against another wall portion defining the cavity <b>14</b>. Thus, the ratchet-type wrench is in a status allowing clockwise ratcheting and free rotation in the counterclockwise direction.</p>
    <p>FIG. 7 illustrates a second embodiment in accordance with the present invention, wherein the gear wheel <b>20</b> is replaced by a drive member <b>70</b> having a drive column <b>73</b> with an engaging means <b>80</b> for releasably engaging with a socket (not shown). The drive member <b>70</b> includes an outer periphery having a plurality of teeth <b>71</b> for engaging with the ratchet teeth <b>41</b>. An annular groove <b>731</b> is defined in a lower portion of the outer periphery of the drive member <b>70</b> for engaging with the C-clip <b>30</b>, which is identical to that disclosed above. In addition, the drive member <b>70</b> includes a stub <b>72</b> on top thereof, and the upper portion of the head <b>11</b> is modified to include an end wall <b>133</b> with an opening <b>134</b> for rotatably receiving the stub <b>72</b> of the drive member <b>70</b>, thereby providing stable rotational movement for the drive member <b>70</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 8 illustrates a third embodiment in accordance with the present invention. It is noted that the biasing means (now designated by <b>90</b>) in this embodiment includes a pin <b>91</b> having a receptacle <b>911</b> for receiving an end of the elastic element <b>92</b>. Thus, the elastic element <b>92</b> is attached between an end wall (not labeled) defining the receptacle <b>911</b> of the pin <b>91</b> and an end wall (not labeled) defining the receptacle <b>521</b> of the switch member <b>50</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 9 illustrates a fourth embodiment in accordance with the present invention. It is noted that the biasing means <b>90</b> in the fourth embodiment is identical to that of the third embodiment, and the drive member <b>70</b> in the fourth embodiment is identical to that of the second embodiment.</p>
    <p>Although the invention has been explained in relation to its preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that many other possible modifications and variations can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as hereinafter claimed.</p>
