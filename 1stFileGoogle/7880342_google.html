    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading> <p num="p-0002">This disclosure generally relates to power transmission networks. More specifically, this disclosure relates to operating a DC power system from one or more AC or DC power generators. Even more specifically, this disclosure relates to regulation of energy transfer between an AC and DC power network.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">Power transmissions networks can be made of AC systems, DC systems, or a combination of the two. AC power networks have conventionally been used throughout the world. However, DC power networks have certain advantages. DC power networks are easier to design and implement because they introduce no reactance into the power system. Higher efficiencies from generators can be achieved in DC systems because only real power is transmitted. Additionally, parallelization of power supplies is simple because the operating frequency of DC power supplies is 0 Hz. Therefore, no synchronization is required when additional supplies or loads are brought onto the network.</p>
    <p num="p-0004">The conventional use of AC power networks is a result of the ease of transmitting AC power over long distances and handling voltage changes using transformers. However, over short distances, such as those in isolated environments, a DC power transmission network could be beneficial for the reasons previously explained. High-power generators available today typically produce AC power. Therefore, operation of a DC transmission network powered by AC generators requires conversion from AC to DC and vice versa.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">Reliable operation of a power network is a critical element of many electronic systems, for example, on drilling platforms or vessels to operate onboard thrusters. Drilling vessels are not anchored in the ocean but are dynamically controlled to maintain a desired position in the ocean. Thrusters are used to maintain a position within specified tolerances of a drilling apparatus. Thrusters are propeller drives which can have variable rotation speed and azimuthal angle of the blades. These thrusters are operated by a power supply onboard the drilling vessel. Any failure of the power supply can lead to displacement of the vessel out of the tolerances of the drilling apparatus. In such a case, the drilling apparatus would need to be mechanically decoupled and recoupled after the power supply is restored and the position of the drilling vessel is corrected.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">One method of facilitating a reliable power supply is to utilize a DC bus for powering thrusters and other components. Such a power transmission system is demonstrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In such a system, the power supply is generally made of AC generators coupled to an AC-to-DC converter. The AC-to-DC converter places power from the AC generators on an intermediate DC bus. The intermediate DC bus may be augmented with DC generators or a battery backup system. Each motor or thruster, as well as other devices utilizing the intermediate DC bus, on board the drilling vessel is coupled to the intermediate DC bus through a DC-to-AC converter.</p>
    <p num="p-0007"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a conventional DC voltage bus coupling multiple AC voltage generation systems to various loads. Power system <b>100</b> includes generators <b>102</b>. Generators <b>102</b> couple to AC bus <b>104</b> through isolators <b>106</b>. Isolators <b>106</b> allow generators <b>102</b> to be removed from the bus when they are not needed or are malfunctioning. AC bus <b>104</b> couples to transformer <b>108</b> to condition the power for transmission to line <b>110</b>. AC-to-DC converter <b>112</b> couples to line <b>110</b> and converts AC power to DC power for output onto intermediate DC bus <b>120</b>. Coupled to DC bus <b>120</b> are DC-to-AC converters <b>130</b>. DC-to-AC converters <b>130</b> convert DC power to AC power which most components are designed to use. Coupled to DC-to-AC converters <b>130</b> is line <b>132</b> to which loads may be connected. Motor <b>134</b> is coupled to line <b>132</b>, and motor <b>134</b> could be, for example, a thruster. Additionally, transformer <b>135</b> is coupled to line <b>132</b> to condition power for load <b>136</b>. Load <b>136</b> could be, for example, a light bulb.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">There are several methods for implementing the AC-to-DC converter necessary for placing power from the AC generators on the intermediate DC bus. These methods conventionally employ the use of either diodes, silicon-controlled rectifiers (SCRs), or transistors.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">One apparatus for AC-to-DC power conversion is a diode rectifier (or a diode pack). The are several forms of diode rectifiers commonly known. One typical diode rectifier is a full-wave diode rectifier. The AC power systems on drilling vessels typically utilize a three-phase waveform such that a six diode rectifier configuration is typically used. Diodes conduct current only when the voltage at the anode of the diode is greater than the voltage at the cathode of the diode. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic illustrating a conventional diode full-wave rectifier for three-phase AC power. Diode rectifier <b>200</b> accepts input from three-phase AC source <b>202</b>. The rectifier <b>200</b> includes diodes <b>204</b> for rectifying the first phase, diodes <b>206</b> for rectifying the second phase, and diodes <b>208</b> for rectifying the third phase. Two diodes are needed in each case to produce output from both the positive AC cycle and the negative AC cycle. Diodes <b>204</b>, diodes <b>206</b>, and diodes <b>208</b> are coupled between the AC source <b>202</b> and the DC bus <b>210</b>. Capacitor <b>212</b> is coupled to the DC bus <b>210</b> to average voltage ripples on DC bus <b>210</b>. While rectifier <b>200</b> is shown as a single rectifier arrangement, several individual arrangements of one power capacity may be placed in parallel to create a rectifier <b>200</b> with a higher power capacity.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">Diode rectifiers are commercially available from various vendors or can be constructed by arranging individually-purchased diodes. The advantages to diode rectifiers are the low cost of the components. Individual diodes and complete rectifiers are relatively inexpensive for high-power configurations, i.e., several megawatts (MW). Diodes are also relatively small devices compared to other available solutions at an equivalent power load. Diode rectifiers, however, have no ability to regulate the output voltage or current. Additionally, they only conduct in one direction.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">As a result of the inability to regulate output voltage or current from diode rectifiers, SCRs, also known as thyristor rectifiers, have largely been used in their place. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic illustrating a conventional arrangement of SCRs for three-phase AC-to-DC conversion. SCR pack <b>300</b> accepts input from three-phase AC source <b>302</b>. SCR pack <b>300</b> includes SCRs <b>304</b> for converting the first phase, SCRs <b>306</b> for converting the second phase, and SCRs <b>308</b> for converting the third phase. Each individual SCR includes a gate terminal <b>305</b> for accepting input. Two SCRs are needed in each case to produce output from both the positive AC cycle and the negative AC cycle. SCRs <b>304</b>, SCRs <b>306</b>, and SCRs <b>308</b> are coupled to AC source <b>302</b> and to DC bus <b>310</b>. Capacitor <b>312</b> is coupled to the DC bus <b>310</b> to average ripples on DC bus <b>310</b>. While SCR pack <b>300</b> is shown as a SCR arrangement, several individual arrangements of one power capacity may be placed in parallel to create a SCR pack <b>300</b> with a higher power capacity.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">Output current may be regulated in the SCRs by controlling through gate terminal <b>305</b> when in the AC cycle they turn on. SCRs also offer the low cost, small size, and reliability of diodes. The disadvantage of SCRs is their slow switching time that must occur in synchronization with the AC power supplies. As a result, they are not well suited to handle the power load changes experienced during instability in the power system. Additionally, once the SCR is turned on through gate terminal <b>305</b>, it may not be turned off through gate terminal <b>305</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0013">Transistors offer yet another solution for AC-to-DC power conversion. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic illustrating a conventional arrangement of transistors for three-phase AC-to-DC power conversion. Transistor pack <b>400</b> accepts input from three-phase AC source <b>402</b>. Transistor pack <b>400</b> includes transistors <b>404</b> to convert the first phase, transistors <b>406</b> to convert the second phase, and transistors <b>408</b> to convert the third phase. Additionally, diodes <b>405</b> are coupled on both sides to transistors <b>404</b> to protect transistors <b>404</b> from damaging voltages which may develop across transistors <b>404</b> and complete the power transfer circuit. This setup is repeated for diodes <b>407</b> coupled to transistors <b>406</b> and diodes <b>409</b> coupled to transistors <b>408</b>. Inductors <b>403</b> condition the power before reaching transistors <b>404</b>, transistors <b>406</b>, and transistors <b>408</b>. Transistors <b>404</b>, transistors <b>406</b>, transistors <b>408</b> are coupled to AC source <b>402</b> and to DC bus <b>410</b>. Capacitor <b>412</b> is coupled to the DC bus <b>410</b> to average ripples on DC bus <b>410</b>. While transistor pack <b>400</b> is shown as a transistor arrangement, several individual arrangements of one power capacity may be placed in parallel to create a transistor pack <b>400</b> with a higher power capacity.</p>
    <p num="p-0014">Transistors possess faster switching characteristics than SCRs as well as the ability to control on and off timing, making them a better solution under transients resulting from real loads. Additionally, transistors allow power flow in both directions through the converter. This allows power to be moved back from the DC bus to the AC bus. It is typically required that multiple transistor-based conversion devices be placed in parallel to handle large loads. Transistors are expensive devices relative to diodes and SCRs and occupy significantly larger amounts of space. Additionally, transistors are fragile and break easily.</p>
    <p num="p-0015">Thus, there is a need for a power system that has the fast switching capability of transistors and the low cost, durability, and small footprint of diodes or SCRs.</p>

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0037">Fast switching characteristics in a DC bus regulator are more likely to be needed at some times than others. Under certain conditions it is more likely that the load scenario can be unpredictable and experience rapid changes making fast switching necessary to maintain the stability of the power system. For example, in the case of a power system on an offshore drilling rig, the power system tends to be unstable where the loads are small compared to the online generator capacity. Under these unstable conditions, the quick reaction time of transistors is desirable. However, when the power system is stable, fast switching may not be required. Where the fast switching of transistors is not needed, diodes or SCRs may be a more durable and cost-effective solution for power conversion.</p>
    <p num="p-0038">By recognizing that the fast switching ability of transistors are only needed during certain system conditions, such as low power load as compared to generator capacity scenarios for an offshore drilling rig power system, a system may be designed to include transistors capable of only handling a fraction of the total power load along with diode or SCRs to handle the remaining load. Thus, such a hybrid system may be reduced in size and cost as compared to an all transistor system for the same total power load while still maintaining fast switching ability when needed. Realization of such a system is not possible by simply combining the two technologies since both technologies perform generally the same function. Rather, creation of a hybrid system requires utilizing a control system that recognizes power conditions during which fast switching is more likely to be needed and power conditions during which the system is likely to be more stable.</p>

    <p num="p-0040"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic illustrating an exemplary DC bus regulator utilizes transistor packs and diode packs according to one embodiment of the invention. Regulator <b>600</b> may be used to implement the operational graph shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Regulator <b>600</b> accepts input from three-phase AC source <b>602</b> conditioned by transformer <b>604</b>. A typical value for AC source <b>602</b> in one application may be 11 kV. Transformer <b>604</b> outputs voltage onto line <b>610</b> and line <b>620</b>. A typical value for lines <b>610</b> and <b>620</b> is 600 V, but they need not be equal. Transistor pack <b>612</b> may be coupled to line <b>610</b> and DC bus <b>614</b>. Transistor pack <b>612</b> may be implemented, at least partially, using transistor pack <b>400</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Diode pack <b>622</b> may be coupled to line <b>610</b> and DC bus <b>614</b>. Diode pack <b>622</b> may be implemented, at least partially, using diode rectifier <b>200</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Microcontroller <b>613</b> is operatively connected to transistor pack <b>612</b> to control the current flow through and output voltage of transistor pack <b>612</b>. Microcontroller <b>613</b> may be any control system capable of controlling transistor pack <b>612</b> such as, for example, a programmable microprocessor, a digital signal processor (“DSP”), field programmable gate array (“FPGA”), application specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”), or any other logical device. Microcontroller <b>613</b> may be integrated with transistor pack <b>612</b> or may be separate. In another embodiment, transistor pack <b>612</b> may independently monitor the voltage of DC bus <b>614</b> and regulate current flow through transistor pack <b>612</b>. In yet another embodiment, loads connected to regulator <b>600</b> may be configured to provide input to microcontroller <b>613</b> about future power demands.</p>
    <p num="p-0041">Turning to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in region of operation <b>511</b>, a substantial portion of the total energy passing through regulator <b>600</b> will pass through transistor pack <b>612</b>. In a preferred embodiment, this is accomplished by microcontroller <b>613</b> controlling transistor pack <b>612</b> such that the voltage on DC bus <b>614</b> is at a level below the voltage on line <b>620</b>, causing the diodes to not conduct. Microcontroller <b>613</b> may control the system such that all current flows through transistor pack <b>612</b> or simply such that a substantial portion flows through transistor pack <b>612</b> and a smaller portion flows through diode pack <b>622</b>. When the power load increases such that region of operation <b>512</b> is entered, additional energy will flow through diode pack <b>622</b>. This may be accomplished in a preferred embodiment by microcontroller <b>613</b> configuring transistor pack <b>612</b> to modify the voltage on DC bus <b>614</b> to enable conduction through diode pack <b>622</b>. When operation re-enters region <b>511</b>, microcontroller <b>613</b> configures transistor pack <b>612</b> to modify the voltage on DC bus <b>614</b> to disable or substantially reduce conduction through diode pack <b>622</b>. When operating in region <b>512</b>, power conduction through transistor pack <b>612</b> may, in some embodiments, be significantly reduced or terminated. As discussed in detail below, this may allow transistor pack <b>612</b> or some portion thereof to be used in other operations around the distribution network. It should be noted that the border between regions <b>511</b> and <b>512</b> need not be the absolute capacity of the available transistors. Rather, the border may be an appropriate value taking into account the available resources of regulator <b>600</b> and the operating characteristics of the system.</p>
    <p num="p-0042">Another embodiment of a system that converts AC-to-DC power combines transistor packs and SCR packs. Advantages of this design are the fast response time of the transistors and the high capacity, low cost, and controllable current of the SCRs.

Transistor pack <b>612</b> is coupled to line <b>610</b> to DC bus <b>614</b>, similar to regulator <b>600</b>.

In region of operation <b>511</b>, a substantial portion of the total energy passing through regulator <b>700</b> will pass through transistor pack <b>612</b>. In a preferred embodiment, microcontroller <b>613</b> may control power flow through transistor pack <b>612</b> in order to regulate the voltage on DC bus <b>614</b>. In one embodiment, microcontroller <b>613</b> also couples to SCR pack <b>722</b>. Microcontroller <b>613</b> may control the gates of the SCRs in SCR pack <b>722</b> to enable power flow through SCR pack <b>722</b>. Alternatively, the microcontroller <b>613</b> may control a second microcontroller (not illustrated) that controls the SCRs.</p>
    <p num="p-0044">Another embodiment of a system that converts AC to DC power combines transistors with diodes or SCRs and resistors. Diodes and SCRs as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> may be used to augment the capacity of transistors when the forward power exceeds the transistor's capacity. However, diodes and SCRs only conduct in one direction preventing them from allowing reverse power flow. In operating region <b>522</b>, resistors, batteries, capacitors, or other storage devices may be added to remove power from DC bus.</p>
    <p num="p-0045"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a schematic illustrating an exemplary DC bus regulator using resistors according to one embodiment of the invention. Regulator <b>800</b> accepts input from AC source <b>602</b> after conditioning by transformer <b>604</b> into line <b>610</b> and line <b>620</b>. Transistor pack <b>612</b> couples line <b>610</b> to DC bus <b>614</b> and diode pack <b>822</b> couples line <b>620</b> to DC bus <b>614</b>. An SCR pack could be used in place of diode pack <b>822</b> to achieve similar results, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Additionally, transistor pack <b>832</b> couples resistors <b>834</b> to DC bus <b>614</b>. Transistor pack <b>832</b> may be comprised of transistors which may be similar to the transistors used in transistor pack <b>612</b>, or may be any other switching component with the necessary operational characteristics. Transistor pack <b>832</b> may be controlled by microcontroller <b>613</b> to enable or disable resistors <b>834</b>. In reverse power operation region <b>521</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, power may flow through transistor pack <b>612</b> back to AC source <b>602</b>. When the power capacity of transistor pack <b>612</b> is reached, microcontroller <b>613</b> may enable transistor pack <b>832</b> allowing power to flow to resistors <b>834</b> and dissipate as heat. When operation returns to region <b>521</b>, microcontroller <b>613</b> may turn off transistor pack <b>832</b> and power flow occurs only through transistor pack <b>612</b>. As discussed above, the border between regions <b>521</b> and <b>522</b> need not be the absolute capacity of the available transistors. Rather, the border may be an appropriate value taking into account the available resources of regulator <b>800</b> and the operating characteristics of the system.</p>
    <p num="p-0046">Although resistors provide power consumption when power needs to be taken off the DC bus, the power is lost in heat dissipation. Since generators consume resources to generate the energy taken off the DC bus, it would be preferable to store the energy in such a means that the energy may be put back on the DC bus at a later time. Such a configuration would increase efficiency and reduce the cost of operating the generators for the power system. Additionally, stored energy may respond more dynamically to changes in power loads. Sudden increases in power demand are difficult to accommodate with AC generators due to the length of response time required to increase fuel consumption to generate the needed power. Furthermore, autonomy from the generators is obtained, because a sudden failure of the AC generators may be compensated by the stored power.</p>
    <p num="p-0047"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a schematic illustrating an exemplary DC bus regulator using a resistor and capacitor for reverse power regulation according to one embodiment of the invention. Regulator <b>900</b> accepts input from AC source <b>602</b> after conditioning by transformer <b>604</b> into line <b>610</b> and line <b>620</b>. Transistor pack <b>612</b> couples line <b>610</b> to DC bus <b>614</b> and diode pack <b>822</b> couples line <b>620</b> to DC bus <b>614</b>. An SCR pack could be used in place of diode pack <b>822</b> to achieve similar results. Additionally, switch <b>942</b> couples capacitors <b>944</b> and resistors <b>946</b> to DC bus <b>614</b>. Switch <b>942</b> may be controlled by microcontroller <b>613</b> to enable or disable capacitors <b>944</b>. Additionally, switch <b>950</b> and switch <b>952</b> coupled to capacitors <b>944</b> and resistors <b>946</b>, respectively, allow energy to be stored in capacitors <b>944</b> or dissipated through resistors <b>946</b>. In reverse power operation region <b>521</b> power may flow through transistor pack <b>612</b> back to AC source <b>602</b>. When the power capacity of transistor pack <b>612</b> is reached, microcontroller <b>613</b> may enable <b>942</b> allowing power to flow to capacitors <b>944</b>. When operation returns to region <b>521</b>, microcontroller <b>613</b> may turn off switch <b>942</b> and power flow occurs only through transistor pack <b>612</b>.

    <p num="p-0048">Although the present disclosure has described in detail using three-phase AC sources, one skilled in the art may readily modify the disclosure in this application to operate on a two phase or other AC system, or from DC generators.</p>
    <p num="p-0049">In the design of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> multiple AC-to-DC converters are required as are multiple DC-to-AC converters and DC-to-DC converters. For example, motor <b>134</b> may operate on AC power and therefore it is necessary to convert the power on the DC bus back to AC before it may be utilized by motor <b>134</b>. One skilled in the art will recognize that DC-to-AC power conversion may be accomplished using similar components as are used for AC-to-DC power conversion. For example, transistor pack <b>612</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> may be configured to perform DC-to-AC conversion. Also, DC-to-DC power conversion may be accomplished using similar components as DC-to-AC and AC-to-DC power conversion.</p>
    <p num="p-0050">In the different regions of operation exemplarily shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, as power flow is diverted from transistors to diodes or SCRs, at least a portion of the transistor pack no longer in use may be switched from converting AC-to-DC power for the DC bus to convert DC-to-AC power for an attached load, energy storage device, or resistor. Such a configuration may reduce the number of transistors required for the power system illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> thereby reducing the space requirements and the cost of the overall power system.</p>
    <p num="p-0051"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a swing pack for AC-to-DC, DC-to-AC, and DC-to-DC conversion according to one embodiment of the invention. Power system <b>1000</b> includes bank of converters <b>1002</b>. Bank of converters <b>1002</b> may be any number or combination of devices capable of AC-to-DC, DC-to-AC, and DC-to-DC conversion, such as transistor pack <b>400</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Bank of converters <b>1002</b> are coupled on one side to DC bus <b>1020</b> and on another side to isolators <b>1004</b>. Isolators <b>1004</b> when closed couple one converter of bank <b>1002</b> to line <b>1014</b> leading to AC or DC generators or to line <b>1012</b> leading to AC or DC loads. The isolators may be controlled, for example, by a microcontroller or other control system that may be separate or the same as microcontroller <b>613</b>.

The selection of which power consumption units are engaged in generator to DC bus power transfer or DC bus to load may be based on the process at hand.
