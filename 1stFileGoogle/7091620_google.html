with wirings connected at first ends thereof to the connection terminals, and bump electrodes connected to the other ends of the wirings. The connection terminals may be at a center part or in peripheral part(s) of the chip main surface and both the elastic structure and wiring substrate are not provided at locations of connection terminals. A resin body seals at least the connection terminals and the exposed first ends of wirings (leads). In a scheme in which the connection terminals are located in a peripheral part of the chip main surface, the wiring substrate protrudes beyond the chip boundary where the connection terminals are arranged, and the resin body shape is restricted by the protruding part of the wiring substrate.</div>

No. 6,307,269; and the entire disclosures of all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">The present invention relates, generally, to a semiconductor device technique such as for the manufacture of a semiconductor integrated circuit device and, in particular, relates to a technique useful in the manufacture of a semiconductor device such as a semiconductor integrated circuit device to be applied to portable equipment, such as portable telephones and handy type personal computers, for which there is a strong trend toward reducing the size, the weight and the thickness of the product and, also, to such technique which leads to the manufacture of a relatively low cost semiconductor device such as a low cost semiconductor integrated circuit device package with improved seal properties in the package such as a CSP (Chip Size Package), although not limited thereto.</p>
    <p num="p-0004">1. Recently, a trend toward reducing the size, the weight and the thickness of the product has become vigorous for electronic equipment along with an improved function and performance. This is largely due to a rapid increase in the use of personal equipment, such as personal telephones or handy type personal computers in recent years. Further, man-machine interface functions have been increased in personally manipulated equipment, for which easy handlability and operability have been considered increasingly important. It is considered that the trend will become more and more conspicuous in expected regular multimedia areas.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">Under such circumstances, development for increasing the density and the degree of integration of semiconductor chips has progressed continuously; however, in addition to the size and the number of electrodes of the semiconductor chips being increased, the size of the packages have also increased rapidly. Accordingly, narrowing of the pitch of terminal leads has been promoted for facilitating the size reduction of the packages, which makes mounting of the package more difficult.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">In view of the above, it has been proposed in recent years to provide high density packages with super-multiple pins having the same area as that of the semiconductor chips, and such packaging techniques are mentioned, for example, in various publications, such as “Nikkei Microdevices” p 98–p 102, issued on May 1, 1994, “Nikkei Microdevices” p 96–p 97, issued on Feb. 1, 1995 by Nikkei BP Co. and “Electronic Material”, p 22–p 28, issued on Apr. 1, 1995 (Heisei 7) by Kogyo Chosakai. One example of the structures produced with such packaging techniques, for example, as described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> of the “Electronic Material” publication, has a package structure in which a flexible wiring substrate is disposed by way of an elastomer (elastic material) on the surface of a semiconductor chip, leads on one end of wirings of the flexible wiring substrate are electrically connected with bonding pads on the surface of the semiconductor chip, and bump lands on the other end of the wirings of the flexible wiring substrate are electrically connected with the solder bumps.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">The package structure has an outer size about equal to or greater than that of a semiconductor chip by the size of a protection frame optionally attached to the periphery of the chip, for which a flexible wiring substrate formed with solder bumps is used. The wiring pattern of the wiring substrate is made of a Cu foil having a Au plating on one side, the top ends of which to be connected with the pad of the chip constitute a lead pattern which is only composed of Au as a result of etching the Cu foil. In this structure, the flexible wiring substrate is bonded by an elastomer on the surface of the semiconductor chip and then the Au leads are connected with the bonding pads of the semiconductor chip.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">2. A CSP, for example, which is a thin, compact semiconductor device of chip size, is often used in printed circuit boards built into portable electronic devices such as that referred-to above. The general structure of a CSP comprises a thin film wiring substrate on which are mounted bump electrodes which are external terminals, leads electrically connected to electrode pads of a semiconductor chip, an elastomer (elastic structure/elastic structural material) arranged between the semiconductor chip and the thin film wiring substrate and having approximately the same size as the thin film wiring substrate, and sealing parts which seal the electrode pads and the leads of the thin film wiring substrate connected to it.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">Structures of CSPs studied by the inventors for comparison purposes, also, are described, for example, in “Nikkei Microdevices” Apr. 1, 1997, No. 142, pp. 44–53, published by Nikkei BP Co. on Apr. 1, 1997, and, in particular, the next generation CSP structure (comparison examples) described in FIG. 6, on page 48 thereof. This CSP comprises a semiconductor chip having electrode pads formed on its main surface, bump electrodes which are external terminals over the main surface of the semiconductor chip, and a contour ring outside the semiconductor chip.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0010">In a study made by the present inventors of the package structure as described in part 1 above, a number of problems were recognized. For example, since the flexible wiring substrate in the package structure described above has a structure typically represented by a TCP (Tape Carrier Package) in which a Cu wiring pattern is formed on the surface of a polyimide tape, and an elastomer is formed to the wiring substrate on the side of the wiring surface, it is difficult to mount the elastomer uniformly and stably because of unevenness of the wiring pattern on the flexible wiring substrate. That is, there exist such problems that voids not filled with the elastomer are formed near both sides of the protrusions of the wiring pattern upon coating or appending the elastomer on the flexible wiring substrate, and the step of bonding the semiconductor chip can not be conducted stably since the size and the shape of the elastomer are not stable.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">Further, bump electrodes are formed on the wiring substrate on the side of the tape. That is, a bump electrode is connected with the wirings by way of a through hole formed in the tape. Since the thickness of the tape is relatively large, for example, as much as 50 μm, if the pitch between the bump electrodes is smaller than the thickness of the tape, the aspect ratio of the through hole is increased to bring about a concern that the bump electrode and the wiring will not be connected. Accordingly, there is a concern that an increase in the number of pins of the package may be restricted.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">In view of the above, an object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor integrated circuit device capable of mounting an elastic structural material to a wiring substrate stably with a high accuracy and making the bonding step of a semiconductor chip stable, thereby enabling assembling with a high yield.</p>
    <p num="p-0013">Another object of the present invention is to provide a technique for promoting an increase in the number of pins in a package.</p>
    <p num="p-0014">An object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor integrated circuit device capable of obtaining excellent electrical properties in view of noise resistance by the adoption of a multiple wiring layer structure.</p>
    <p num="p-0015">An object of the present invention is to prevent wiring from becoming contaminated ingredients of an elastic structural material.</p>
    <p num="p-0016">An object of the present invention is to prevent a semiconductor chip from being damaged, improve the reliability of the semiconductor chip, as well as prevent connection failure between an elastic structural material and the semiconductor chip, worsening of the flatness of the wiring substrate and lowering of reliability.</p>
    <p num="p-0017">An object of the present invention is to eliminate a requirement for a soft-modified special wire bonder and to effect a shortening of the contact time upon bonding by further simplifying the trace of the bonding tool.</p>
    <p num="p-0018">An object of the present invention is to solve a problem concerning disconnection of wirings.</p>
    <p num="p-0019">An object of the present invention is to reduce any damage to a passivation layer or a semiconductor chip therebelow and further improve the bondability by preventing contamination of the wirings.</p>
    <p num="p-0020">An object of the present invention is to increase the bonding strength between wirings and a substrate material and obtain a stable notch cutting performance.</p>
    <p num="p-0021">An object of the present invention is to suppress warp of a wiring substrate and improve bondability with a bonding material, so as to achieve a package having excellent moisture proofness and reliability.</p>
    <p num="p-0022">An object of the present invention is to improve the groove-fillage capability of an elastic structural material, capable of increasing the strength of a metal mask, by using a plurality of one side bridging portions, and further improving the groove-fillage capability by the formation of a stopping dam for sealant flow.</p>
    <p num="p-0023">An object of the present invention is to improve the bondability and prevent damage to a semiconductor chip in an inner lead bonding technique.</p>
    <p num="p-0024">An object of the present invention is to form a suitable S-shaped configuration with no return of a bonding tool but by merely driving the bonding tool vertically using a wiring design which takes into consideration a bending stress ratio.</p>
    <p num="p-0025">An object of the present invention is to reduce the occurrence of cracks in wirings per se and moderate bonding damage to a semiconductor chip.</p>
    <p num="p-0026">An object of the present invention is to suppress bleeding of low molecular weight ingredients of an elastic structural material and further avoid a disadvantage involving the creation of voids upon forming the elastic structural material by surface flattening.</p>
    <p num="p-0027">An object of the present invention is to improve the fabrication accuracy for hole diameter for connection of a bump electrode in a method of manufacturing a semiconductor integrated circuit.</p>
    <p num="p-0028">An object of the present invention is to provide a technique for forming a semiconductor package which is capable of bonding bump electrodes more satisfactorily, reducing the pitch of the bump electrodes and which provides output terminals at a higher density in a method of manufacturing a semiconductor integrated circuit device.</p>
    <p num="p-0029">These and other objects, as well as novel features of the present invention will become apparent by consideration of the descriptions in the specification with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="p-0030">Among the featured aspects disclosed in the present application, a summary of typical examples thereof is given below.</p>
    <p num="p-0031">That is, one of the semiconductor integrated circuit devices according to the present invention provides a package structure applied to a semiconductor integrated circuit device in which a wiring substrate is disposed by way of an elastic structural material on a main surface of a semiconductor chip, lead portions on one end of the wirings of the wiring substrate are electrically connected with external terminals on the main surface of the semiconductor chip, and land portions on the other end of the wirings of the wiring substrate are electrically connected with bump electrodes, wherein the wiring substrate has wirings formed on a first, main surface of a substrate base material (tape), and an elastic structural material is disposed on a second surface of the substrate base material, opposite the main surface thereof.</p>

    <p num="p-0035">Further, in a semiconductor integrated circuit device of the present invention, the size of the end of the elastic structural member of the semiconductor chip on the side of the external terminals and the end of the substrate base material of the wiring substrate are determined based on the ingredients of the elastic structural material.</p>

    <p num="p-0038">Further, in a semiconductor integrated circuit device of the present invention, the wirings of the wiring substrate are formed as a cantilever structure fixed at one side to the substrate base material of the wiring substrate.</p>
    <p num="p-0039">Further, in a semiconductor integrated circuit device of the present invention, the size of the end of an opening in a surface protection film on the semiconductor chip is determined within such a range that the wirings do not interfere with the surface protection film at least on the side thereof on which a bonding tool is driven down.</p>
    <p num="p-0040">Further, in a semiconductor integrated circuit device of the present invention, the wirings of the wiring substrate are formed such that an effective area of a wiring portion of the wiring on the side of the notch terminal end is made larger. Particularly, the wiring portion on the side of the notch terminal end is connected with an opposed land portion of the wirings, or is extended longitudinally or laterally in a vacant region of the wirings, or adjacent wirings are connected with each other.</p>
    <p num="p-0041">Further, in a semiconductor integrated circuit device of the present invention, the elastic structural material is formed within a range greater over the entire circumference at least by more than the width of a protrusion at the outer circumferential portion formed in the elastic structural material.</p>
    <p num="p-0042">Further, in a semiconductor integrated circuit device of the present invention, when the elastic structural material is formed in two parts so as not to be bonded on the external terminals of the semiconductor chip, each of the ends of spaces to which the divided elastic structural materials are opposed is formed in a groove-shape. Particularly, a plurality of grooves are formed at each of the ends of the elastic structural material, or a stepping dam for sealant flow is formed beforehand during a sealing step.</p>
    <p num="p-0043">Further, in a semiconductor integrated circuit device of the present invention, the connection structure between the external terminals of the semiconductor chip and the wirings of the wiring substrate are formed by pre-forming stud bumps on the external terminals of the semiconductor chip, and the external terminals of the semiconductor chip and the wirings of the wiring substrate are connected by way of the stud bumps.</p>
    <p num="p-0044">Further, in a semiconductor integrated circuit device of the present invention, the connection structure between the external terminals of the semiconductor chip and the wiring substrate is formed by supplying solder beforehand so as to surround the wirings of the wiring substrate and the external terminals of the semiconductor chip, and the external terminals of the semiconductor chip are connected by way of the solder.</p>
    <p num="p-0045">Further, in a semiconductor integrated circuit device of the present invention, the connection structure between the external terminals of the semiconductor chip and the wirings of the semiconductor substrate are formed by connecting the wirings of the wiring substrate and the external terminals of the semiconductor chip by way of stud bumps by using stud bumps of solder or Au ball so as to surround the wirings of the wiring substrate from above.</p>
    <p num="p-0046">Further, in a semiconductor integrated circuit device of the present invention, the connection structure between the external terminals of the semiconductor chip and the wirings of the wiring substrate are formed by connecting the wirings of the wiring substrate and the external terminals of the semiconductor chip by using Al, solder or Au wire.</p>
    <p num="p-0047">Further, in a semiconductor integrated circuit device of the present invention, the wiring structure of the wiring substrate is formed by narrowing the lateral size of the wirings from the end of the substrate base material of the wiring substrate to the top end of the wirings, such that the bending stress ratio α is represented by:
<br>α=σ1/σ0<br>
where σ<b>0</b> is bending strength caused at the end of the substrate base material and σ1 is maximum stress caused at an intermediate portion between the end of the substrate base material and the top end of the wirings, and wherein the lateral size is made constant particularly from a predetermined position, and the size and the shape of the wirings are determined such that the bending stress ratio α is from 1.2 to 1.5 in a case where the bending stress ratio α is represented by the following formula:
<br>α=<i>b</i>1×(<i>L</i>2<i>−L</i>1)/(<i>b</i>2<i>×L</i>2)<br>
in which L<b>1</b> is a taper length, L<b>2</b> is a wiring length, b<b>1</b> is a taper width and b<b>2</b> is a wiring width.
</p>
    <p num="p-0048">Further, in a semiconductor integrated circuit device of the present invention, the wiring structure of the wiring substrate is formed by using an electroconductive material as a core material and applying Au plating on the surface.</p>
    <p num="p-0049">Further, the wiring structure of the wiring substrate is formed by using Cu as a core material, applying Au plating on the surface and making at least one end connected with the external electrodes of the chip into an S-shaped configuration.</p>
    <p num="p-0050">Further, in a semiconductor integrated circuit device of the present invention, a flattening insulation film is formed on the wiring substrate on the side of the wirings and an elastic structural material is disposed on the insulation film.</p>
    <p num="p-0051">Further, a method of manufacturing a semiconductor integrated circuit device according to the present invention comprises a step of forming an elastic structural material on the rear face of a wiring substrate (tape side) in which wirings are formed on the substrate base material (tape), a step of bonding a semiconductor chip to the surface of the elastic structural material so as to oppose the wiring substrate, a step of connecting one end of the wirings to the external terminals of the semiconductor chip, a step of forming an insulation film thinner than the substrate base material on a main surface of the wirings, a step of forming openings to the insulation film each at a position corresponding to the other end of the wirings to be joined with the bump electrodes, and a step of forming the bump electrodes being joined to the other end of the wirings by way of the wirings.</p>
    <p num="p-0052">Additionally, in a semiconductor device package structure like the CSP having the aforesaid general structure, discussed in part 2 above, problems due to resin flow of the package sealant arise. For example, a sealing resin easily flows onto the sides of the semiconductor chip. This impairs the precision of the contour size of the CSP so that, in some cases, it could not be inserted in its socket. In other words, a problem arises in that the contour shape of the CSP does not remain fixed.</p>
    <p num="p-0053">If the amount of sealing resin is reduced in an attempt to solve such a problem in the case of the aforementioned CSP, the leads of the thin film wiring substrate may be exposed. This would adversely affect the sealing properties of the package. Namely, the sealing properties of the sealing parts would become inadequate, and humidity resistance would no longer be reliable.</p>
    <p num="p-0054">In the comparison of CSP structures of the prior art, if the contour ring is made a separate structure, manufacturing costs increase.</p>
    <p num="p-0055">In a CSP having the usual structure, during solder reflow in forming the bump electrodes, the internal pressure rises due to expansion of moisture and gas in the elastomer, and, as a result, the seal part is destroyed causing a “popcorn” phenomenon.</p>
    <p num="p-0056">It is, therefore, also an object of this invention to provide a chip size semiconductor device of lower cost and improved sealing properties, and a method of manufacturing such a device.</p>
    <p num="p-0057">It is a further object of this invention to provide a semiconductor device and manufacturing method which prevents occurrence of the aforementioned popcorn phenomenon.</p>

    <p num="p-0220">The semiconductor integrated circuit device representing Embodiment 1 of the present invention is in the form of a 40 pin ball grid array type semiconductor package, comprising a semiconductor chip <b>1</b> having a plurality of semiconductor elements and a plurality of bonding pads formed on a main surface, and an elastomer <b>2</b> (elastic structural material) bonded on the main surface of the semiconductor chip excepting for the portions forming the bonding pads, a flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> (wiring substrate) formed with wirings connected at one end to the bonding pads of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>, a solder resist <b>4</b> (insulation film) formed on a main surface of the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b>, and bumps <b>5</b> (bump electrodes) formed on a main surface of the solder resist <b>4</b> and connected to the other end of the wirings by way of openings in the solder resist <b>4</b>, to constitute a package structure in which the bonding portion of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> is covered by a sealant <b>6</b>, such as a resin.</p>
    <p num="p-0221">The semiconductor chip <b>1</b> has, for example, a center pad structure as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in which a plurality of bonding pads <b>7</b> (external terminals) are formed in one row at a central portion in the longitudinal direction, and the bonding pads are arranged at non-uniform intervals. Predetermined integrated circuits, such as memory circuits and logic circuits, are formed in the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>, for example, on a semiconductor substrate, such as made of silicon, and the bonding pads <b>7</b> made of a material such as Al are disposed as the external terminals for such circuits.</p>
    <p num="p-0222">The elastomer <b>2</b> is made of an elastic material, for example, a silicone resin, which is formed on the main surface of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>, being bisected longitudinally of the chip <b>1</b> to provide the portion formed with the bonding pads <b>7</b>, and is bonded to the main surface of the chip <b>1</b> by way of the adhesive <b>8</b>. The elastomer <b>2</b> is provided for moderating stress concentration on the soldering bumps <b>5</b> mainly caused by the difference in the heat expansion coefficients of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> and the package mounting substrate.</p>
    <p num="p-0223">The flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> comprises, for example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a tape <b>9</b> as a basic material of the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> (substrate base material) and wirings <b>10</b> bonded on the main surface of the tape <b>9</b> by an adhesive <b>9</b>′, in which leads <b>11</b> on one end of the wirings <b>10</b> are connected to the bonding pads <b>7</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>, and bump lands <b>12</b> on the other end are connected with the soldering bumps <b>5</b>. In the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b>, the rear face of the tape <b>9</b> (on the side opposite to the surface formed with the wirings <b>10</b>) is bonded to the elastomer <b>2</b>, and the solder resist <b>4</b> is formed on the main surface of the wirings <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0224">The tape <b>9</b> constituting the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> is made of a material, for example, a polyimide resin, and a material such as Cu is used as the core material for the wiring <b>10</b>. A portion of the lead <b>11</b> serving as one end of the wiring <b>10</b> is formed with an Ni plating layer so as to cover the surface of the core material, and an Au plating layer is formed further so as to cover the surface of the Ni plating layer.</p>
    <p num="p-0225">The solder resist <b>4</b> is made of an insulation material, such as a light sensitive epoxy resin, and the solder bumps <b>5</b> are formed on the main surface of the wirings <b>10</b> of the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> by way of the openings in the solder resist <b>4</b> for a predetermined range of the wirings <b>10</b>, except for the connection portion connected to the bump lands.</p>
    <p num="p-0226">The soldering bumps <b>5</b> are made of a material, for example, a Pb(60%)-Sn(40%) solder or an alloyed solder mainly composed of Pb—Sn, and is connected to the bump lands <b>12</b> of the wirings <b>10</b> constituting the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b>. The solder bumps <b>5</b> are arranged in two rows in the regions on both side of the bonding pads <b>7</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0227">The thus constituted semiconductor integrated circuit device is mounted, for example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, as a semiconductor integrated circuit device of a chip size package <b>13</b>, for example, a DRAM, together with a semiconductor integrated circuit device of QFP type package <b>14</b>, onto a mounting substrate <b>15</b>, which is made, for example, of glass or epoxy, on a memory card and can be retractably mounted with respect to portable equipment, such as a portable telephone or a handy type personal computer by way of external connection terminals <b>16</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0228">For the function of the Embodiment 1 of the present invention, an outline of the steps of assembling the semiconductor package will be explained on the basis of the process flow shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0229">At first, before assembling the semiconductor package, wirings <b>10</b> are formed on the tape <b>9</b>, the flexible wiring substrates having the leads <b>11</b> formed by etching a portion of the wirings <b>10</b>. Further, the elastomer <b>2</b>, the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> formed with predetermined integrated circuits and provided with the bonding pads <b>7</b> as external terminals, the sealant <b>6</b>, and flux and solder forming the solder balls <b>17</b> are provided.</p>
    <p num="p-0230">The flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> can be prepared, for example, as typically represented by the technique of a TAB (Tape Automatic Bonding) tape, by bonding a thin metal foil such as Cu on a tape <b>9</b> made of a polyimide resin by means of an adhesive, forming a required pattern by photoresist on the metal foil using a photographic technique, then forming a desired wiring pattern <b>10</b> by etching (including also leads <b>11</b>) and, further, applying Ni—Au plating treatment to the surface thereof, for example, by an electric field plating method.</p>
    <p num="p-0231">Then, for example, the elastomer <b>2</b> is formed by printing to a thickness of 50 to 150 μm on the tape <b>9</b> of the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b>, and a silicone type adhesive <b>8</b> is coated and printed on the surface of the elastomer <b>2</b> (steps <b>501</b>, <b>502</b>). The elastomer <b>2</b> is not always printed, but an elastomer previously formed into a film-shape may be cut into a predetermined shape and bonded to the rear face of the tape <b>9</b> by means of the adhesive <b>8</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0232">Further, the leads <b>11</b> at one end of the wirings <b>10</b> of the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> and the bonding pads <b>7</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> are aligned such that their relative positions coincide with each other, and the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> is appended by adhesion to the elastomer <b>2</b> printed on the tape <b>19</b> of the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> (step <b>503</b>).</p>
    <p num="p-0233">Then, the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> and the tape <b>9</b> of the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> in a state appended by way of the elastomer <b>2</b> are turned upside down in the lead bonding step, the lead <b>11</b> is driven down on the bonding pad <b>7</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> while being deformed into a S-shaped configuration by a bonding tool <b>18</b>, as shown by the cross section in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and the lead <b>11</b> and the bonding pad <b>7</b> are connected, for example, by a method of supersonic thermal press bonding (step <b>504</b>).</p>
    <p num="p-0234">Successively, in the sealing step, the lead bonding portion of the bonding pad <b>7</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> and the lead <b>11</b> of the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> are resin encapsulated, for example, by coating a sealant <b>6</b>, such as an epoxy resin, from a dispenser <b>19</b> to thereby enhance the reliability at the junction portion between the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> and the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> (step <b>505</b>).</p>
    <p num="p-0235">Subsequently, in the cutting step for the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b>, the outer edge portion of the tape <b>9</b> is cut along a position somewhat outside the edge of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>, to form a package outer shape of CSP (Chip Size Package or Chip Scale Package) (step <b>506</b>).</p>
    <p num="p-0236">Then, in the bump attaching step of the solder bump <b>5</b>, the bump <b>5</b> is formed by joining a solder ball <b>17</b> to the corresponding bump land <b>12</b> of the wirings <b>10</b> of the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> to form the bump <b>5</b> and, finally, by way of the selection and marking, the step of assembling the semiconductor package in the Embodiment 1 according to the present invention is finished (step <b>507</b>, <b>508</b>).</p>
    <p num="p-0237">In the step of assembling the semiconductor package, the order of the tape cutting step (step <b>506</b>) and the bump attaching step (step <b>507</b>) may be reversed.</p>
    <p num="p-0238">Thus, the Embodiment 1 has a semiconductor package structure in which bonding pads <b>7</b> are arranged concentrically in one row along a central portion of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>, and the solder bumps <b>5</b> are disposed at the inside of the outer circumference of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> connected by way of the wirings <b>10</b> of the flexible wiring substrate from the bonding pads <b>7</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0239">Now, the feature of the package structure for the semiconductor integrated circuit device of the Embodiment 1 will be explained by comparison with a package structure formed by a technique studied by the present inventors including the structure and the process with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref> successively.</p>
    <p num="p-0240">1. Surface Wiring Structure (a Structure in Which the Elastomer is Formed on the Wiring Substrate on the Side of the Tape and the Bump Electrodes are Formed on the Side of the Wirings)</p>
    <p num="p-0241">To assist in providing technical explanation of the surface wiring structure, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a cross sectional view of a main portion illustrating the surface wiring structure, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a cross sectional view of a main portion illustrating the rear face wiring structure (a structure in which bump electrodes are formed to the wiring substrate on the side of the tape and the elastomer is formed on the side of the wirings) and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a cross sectional view of a main portion illustrating wirings on both surfaces.</p>
    <p num="p-0242">The package structure of the Embodiment 1 is a so-called “surface wiring structure” as shown in an enlarged scale in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in which an elastomer <b>2</b> is bonded to a flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> on one side of a tape <b>9</b> (on the side facing the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>) and a solder resist <b>4</b> and a bump electrode <b>5</b> are formed on the other side of the wirings <b>10</b>. On the other hand, there is a technique studied by the present inventor which may be referred to as a so-called “rear face wiring structure”, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in which an elastomer <b>2</b> is bonded on one side of the wiring <b>10</b> and a solder bump <b>5</b> is formed on the other side of the tape <b>9</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an Au plating <b>11</b> <i>a </i>is formed, for example, by an electric field plating on the surface of a lead <b>11</b> on one end and on the surface of a land <b>12</b> on the other end of the wiring <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0243">In the rear face wiring structure described above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a through hole <b>12</b> <i>b </i>for joining the bump <b>5</b> is formed, for example, by punching out an opening in the tape <b>9</b>, which is made of a material such as a polyimide resin, whereas in the surface wiring structure of the Embodiment 1, as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a solder resist <b>4</b> made of a material such as a light sensitive epoxy resin is coated on the main surface of the wiring <b>10</b>, and a connection hole <b>12</b> <i>a </i>of a desired size is formed at a desired position by a photographic process, such as exposure and development, so that the following advantages can be expected.</p>
    <p num="p-0244">(1) Since the opening for the solder bump <b>5</b> is formed by exposure and development of the solder resist <b>4</b>, the fabrication accuracy for the hole diameter can be improved compared with a case of puncturing an opening in the tape <b>9</b> of the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> in the rear face wiring structure by machining.</p>
    <p num="p-0245">(2) While the minimum thickness of the tape <b>9</b>, in practice, is about 50 μm, the solder resist <b>4</b> can be coated to a thickness of about 10 to 20 μm stably depending on the coating condition, so that a smaller solder ball <b>17</b> can be joined satisfactorily.</p>
    <p num="p-0246">For example, in a case of forming a solder bump of about 30 μm diameter, which is less than the thickness of the tape <b>9</b>, the aspect ratio of the through hole is excessively large in the rear face wiring structure, thereby possibly resulting in a connection failure. On the other hand, the aspect ratio can be lowered to cope with such a problem in the surface wiring structure.</p>
    <p num="p-0247">(3) Since the pitch of the solder bumps <b>5</b> can be made smaller in the surface wiring structure as compared with the rear face wiring structure, a semiconductor package having output terminals for the solder bumps arranged with a higher density can be obtained.</p>
    <p num="p-0248">(4) Since an elastomer <b>2</b> is disposed on the flat surface at the back of the tape <b>9</b>, the elastomer <b>2</b> can be mounted (coated or appended) in a voidless manner stably with a high accuracy. Further, since the size and the shape of the elastomer <b>2</b> are stabilized, the step of bonding the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> is also stable, thereby making it possible to conduct assembling at a higher yield.</p>
    <p num="p-0249">As described above, the technique of forming the rear face wiring structure results in problems, such as in the formation of the opening in the tape <b>9</b> of the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> and in the bondability between the wirings <b>10</b> of the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> and the elastomer <b>2</b>, whereas such problems can be solved by adopting the surface wiring structure as provided in the Embodiment 1.</p>
    <p num="p-0250">Further, in the wiring structure of the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b>, it is possible to use a flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> having a double face wiring structure, for example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, that is, having layered wirings on both surfaces of the tape <b>9</b>, in addition to the single face wiring structure as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and it can be applied further to three or more layered wiring structures.</p>
    <p num="p-0251">In the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a first wiring <b>20</b> is used as a signal wiring while the second wiring <b>21</b> is used as a ground plane, in which the second wiring <b>21</b> and the bump <b>5</b> or the first wiring <b>20</b> are electrically connected by way of a via hole <b>22</b>. Such a structure has the advantage of obtaining an excellent electric characteristic, for example, from the point of view of noise resistance.</p>
    <p num="p-0252">2. Optimization of Tape Edge Position Relative to Elastomer</p>
    <p num="p-0253">To assist in providing a technical explanation of the optimization of tape edge position relative to the elastomer, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a plane view illustrating window openings, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a cross sectional view illustrating a window opening in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a cross sectional view for assisting in the explanation of the size of the window opening portion and the edge portion of the semiconductor chip.</p>
    <p num="p-0254">The package structure of the Embodiment 1, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, has a BGA (Ball Grid Array) structure in which the solder bumps <b>5</b> are arranged in a matrix on the main surface of the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b>. In this example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the semiconductor <b>1</b> has a center pad arrangement in which a window opening portion <b>23</b> is disposed longitudinally at a central portion, and the portion and the peripheral edge of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> are resin capsulated by the sealant <b>6</b> to attain a structure of high moisture proofness and reliability in the final structure.</p>
    <p num="p-0255">By the way, in the technique studied by the present inventor, when the end of the elastomer <b>2</b> (on the side of the window opening <b>23</b>) is brought closer to the edge of the tape <b>9</b>, that is, if the length L<b>1</b> between the end of the elastomer <b>2</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> on the side of the bonding pad <b>7</b> and the end of the tape <b>9</b> is reduced, contamination to the lead <b>11</b> results due to a bleeding ingredient and volatile ingredient of the elastomer <b>2</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0256">On the other hand, if the length L<b>1</b> is made larger, that is, if the elastomer is excessively retracted (i.e., recessed) from the edge of the tape <b>9</b>, the length L<b>2</b> between the end of the elastomer <b>2</b> and the solder bump <b>5</b> is reduced, and since the elastomer <b>2</b> is not present below the innermost portion of the solder bump <b>5</b>, this may possibly increase the variation in the height of the solder bump <b>5</b> or widen the encapsulation region for the window opening <b>23</b>, making it difficult to fill in the sealant <b>6</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0257">On the other hand, in the Embodiment 1, these problems can be solved simultaneously by selecting an appropriate length for L<b>1</b> so as to set the end of the elastomer <b>2</b> at an optimal position between the end of the tape <b>9</b> and the solder bump <b>5</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0258">That is, in order to eliminate the foregoing problems related to the window opening <b>23</b>, the length L<b>1</b> is defined as indicated below. For example, in this embodiment, the printing accuracy of the elastomer <b>2</b> is defined as about ±100 μm. Accordingly, if the length L<b>1</b> is less than 100 μm, since it may extend outside of the tape <b>9</b> due to a printing deviation, it must be greater than the printing accuracy (100 μm) at the least.</p>
    <p num="p-0259">Further, since there is no problem from contamination to the lead <b>11</b> by a bleeding ingredient or volatile ingredient of the elastomer <b>2</b> if it is actually spaced by about 300 μm from the actual edge, the length L<b>2</b> is set, for example, at 300 μm as a minimum. However, a design with a minimum value of about 100 μm is possible if an elastomer <b>2</b> of less contamination and bleeding is used or a countermeasure, for example, cleaning of the contamination, is adopted.</p>
    <p num="p-0260">As described above, contamination to the lead <b>11</b> caused by bleeding ingredients or volatile ingredients of the elastomer <b>2</b> can be prevented, the variation in the height of the solder bumps <b>5</b> can be made stable and the sealing region of the window opening <b>23</b> can be filled with ease by selecting an appropriate length L<b>1</b> as provided in the Embodiment 1.</p>
    <p num="p-0261">3. Optimization of the Outer Size of the Package</p>
    <p num="p-0262">To assist in providing a technical explanation of the optimization of the outer size of the package, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a cross sectional view for explaining the size of the window opening and the edge portion of the semiconductor chip, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a cross sectional view illustrating a concave portion of the elastomer after printing and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a cross sectional view illustrating warp in the tape after appending a semiconductor chip.</p>
    <p num="p-0263">For example, in the technique studied by the present inventor, looking to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> and assuming that the distance between the end of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> on the outer circumference of the package and the end of the tape <b>9</b> of the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> is M<b>1</b> and the distance between the end of the elastomer <b>2</b> and the end of the tape <b>9</b> is M<b>2</b>, the following problems are present:</p>
    <p num="p-0264">(1) If M<b>1</b>&lt;0, since the outermost circumference of the package is represented by the wall of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>, there is a great possibility of inducing cracks in the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> during the assembling step, particularly upon insertion and withdrawal of the chip from a receptacle, during tray transportation and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0265">(2) If M<b>1</b>&lt;0, M<b>2</b>&gt;0, since the circuit surface of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> will be exposed to the outside, a problem may be caused which affects the reliability and the sealing for preventing this, although this possibly leads to an increase of the fabrication steps.</p>
    <p num="p-0266">(3) If M<b>1</b>−M<b>2</b>&lt;0, peripheral protrusions of the elastomer <b>2</b> after printing, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, interferes with the bonding portion of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, so as to cause bonding failure upon appending, reducing the flatness of the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> and causing a reduction of the reliability.</p>
    <p num="p-0267">(4) If M<b>2</b>=0, it is necessary to cut the elastomer <b>2</b>, which causes a problem due to the difficulty of the cutting.</p>
    <p num="p-0268">On the other hand, in the Embodiment 1, the foregoing problems can be overcome by determining the relationship for the distance between the end of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> or the end of the elastomer <b>2</b> and end of the tape <b>9</b> as: M<b>1</b>&gt;M<b>2</b>&gt;0. That is, in the explanatory view illustrating the edge portion of the package in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, since the cutting error in the tape cutting step for determining the final outer shape is about 100 μm, it is desirable to ensure that M<b>2</b> is more than 100 μm in order that the cutting jig does not reach the elastomer <b>2</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0269">By the way, the cross sectional shape after forming the elastomer <b>2</b> by printing and hardening the same by baking is as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, which shows that a peripheral portion tends to be higher as a result of being pulled by the mask upon leaving the plate after printing in a case of a material having a thixotropic property which is higher to some extent. For example, if the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> is appended to the elastomer <b>2</b> under the condition that M<b>1</b>&lt;M<b>2</b> so that the end of the semiconductor chip extends past the end of the elastomer <b>2</b>, a problem occurs in that the surface of the tape <b>9</b> warps to conform to the cross sectional shape of the elastomer <b>2</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0270">In order to prevent this, it is effective to eliminate the high peripheral portion of the elastomer <b>2</b> at the outside of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> by setting M<b>1</b>&gt;M<b>2</b>. For instance, since the width of the protrusion is about 200 μm, it is desirable for (M<b>1</b>−M<b>2</b>) to be 240 μm and the distance M<b>1</b> to be about 360 μm in view of the distance M<b>2</b>=100 μm being provided for the cutting property.</p>
    <p num="p-0271">Cutting the tape <b>9</b> at the outer circumference as described above provides advantages in that the outer shape error is reduced, and peripheral jigs such as a receptacle or a tray need not be changed to change the size to some extent of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0272">As described above, in the Embodiment 1, it is possible to avoid cracking and chipping of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> to improve the cutting margin during the cutting step. Further, the circuit surface of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> can be entirely disposed below the elastomer <b>2</b> to provide the advantage of improving the moisture proofness and eliminating the requirement for sealing the outer circumferential portion.</p>
    <p num="p-0273">4. Planar S-shaped Lead</p>
    <p num="p-0274">To assist in providing a technical explanation of the planar S-shaped lead, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a plan view illustrating a planar S-shaped lead, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a cross sectional view as seen in the direction of arrow B in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a cross sectional view as seen in the direction of arrow A in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a cross sectional view illustrating the trace of a bonding tool upon forming a standard S-shaped lead and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a cross sectional view illustrating the trace of a bonding tool upon forming a planar S-shaped lead.</p>
    <p num="p-0275">The S-shaped configuration is such that the length of a lead <b>11</b> at one end of a wiring <b>10</b> is substantially longer than the linear distance between a pad <b>7</b> of a chip <b>1</b> and the edge portion <b>11</b> <i>b </i>of the tape <b>9</b>, so that stresses on the lead <b>11</b> can be reduced.</p>
    <p num="p-0276">For example, in the technique of forming a standard S-shaped lead <b>24</b> as studied by the present inventor, the lead which is employed is a linear notch lead or a beam lead, as shown by the dotted line in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, and in order to form a sag (S-shaped configuration) sufficient to withstand thermal deformation during bonding, as shown by a fine line in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, it is necessary to employ a motion along a special bonding tool trace <b>25</b> which involves first driving down the lead <b>11</b> just above the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>, then laterally displacing the lead and then again driving it down onto the bonding pad <b>7</b>, which operation may require a special wire bonder.</p>
    <p num="p-0277">On the other hand, in the Embodiment 1, the foregoing problem can be solved by preparing the lead <b>11</b> of the wiring <b>10</b> so that it does not have a linear shape, but is a planar lead <b>26</b> of a S-shaped configuration in which the base portion of the wiring <b>10</b> and the bonding portion at the top end are previously displaced at least by more than the width of the lead <b>11</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, upon forming the wiring <b>10</b> on the tape <b>9</b> of the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0278">As described above, by such forming of the planar S-shaped lead <b>26</b>, a lead having a stable and suitable S-shaped configuration can be formed by a bonding tool trace <b>25</b> by simply driving down a typical wire bonder, as shown in FIG. <b>18</b>, since a sag due to the original planar S-shaped configuration is formed as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, although a straightened shape as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is formed.</p>
    <p num="p-0279">Thus, a planar S-shaped lead <b>26</b> of stable S-shaped configuration can be found with no requirement for a soft-modified special wire bonder and, further, an effect for shortening the contact time upon bonding can also be expected since the bonding tool trace <b>25</b> can also be simplified.</p>
    <p num="p-0280">5. Beam Lead</p>
    <p num="p-0281">To assist in providing a technical explanation of the beam lead, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a plan view for explaining a notch lead and a beam lead, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a plan view illustrating a notch lead in a portion A of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a plan view illustrating a beam lead.</p>
    <p num="p-0282">For example, in the technique studied by the present inventor, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, which is an enlarged view of the lead <b>11</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the lead <b>11</b> is formed with a notch <b>27</b>, for example, of a V-shaped cut at a cutting portion. A portion slightly inside of the notch <b>27</b> is driven downwardly by a bonding tool <b>18</b> upon bonding, to cut the lead <b>11</b> at the portion of the notch <b>27</b>. However, the width of the notch <b>27</b> changes due to varied etching for the wiring <b>10</b> in the manufacturing step for producing the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b>, leading to the possibility that the lead will not be cut upon bonding.</p>
    <p num="p-0283">Further, even if it is cut, there still may be a problem in that the lead may be cut at a portion different from the desired notch <b>27</b>, or the notch may be too narrow resulting in the lead being disconnected before the plating step of the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b>, so that the plating can not be accomplished.</p>
    <p num="p-0284">On the other hand, in the Embodiment 1, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the problem upon cutting the lead <b>11</b> as described above can be overcome by forming the lead with a cantilever beam structure, namely, a so-called beam lead <b>28</b> in which one end is fixed to the tape <b>9</b> of the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> and the other end as the cutting side formed with the notch <b>27</b> is left open.</p>
    <p num="p-0285">6. Passivation Size for the Periphery of the Bonding Pad</p>
    <p num="p-0286">To assist in providing a technical explanation of the size of the passivation film at the periphery of the bonding pad, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is a cross sectional view illustrating a lead bonding portion, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is a plan view illustrating a lead bonding portion, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is a cross sectional view illustrating a tool landing point at the portion in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> in an enlarged scale, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is a cross sectional view illustrating a bonding portion improved for the size of the passivation opening and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> is a plan view illustrating a bonding portion of a two way lead.</p>
    <p num="p-0287">In a memory chip typically represented by a DRAM or the like, a passivation film <b>29</b> made of a polyimide type resin is formed on the chip for preventing soft errors caused by α-rays.</p>
    <p num="p-0288">For example, in the technique studied by the present inventor, since the lead <b>11</b> is first driven downwardly just above the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>, then displaced laterally and again driven downwardly on the bonding pad <b>7</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>, as shown by the bonding tool trace <b>25</b> in the bonding sequence in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, there is the possibility of a problem in that the passivation film <b>29</b> on the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> or the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> therebelow may undergo damage during the first driving down operation, or ingredients of the passivation film <b>29</b> may be deposited to contaminate the bonding portion on the lower surface of the lead <b>11</b> to degrade the bondability.</p>
    <p num="p-0289">On the other hand, in the Embodiment 1, the foregoing problems can be solved by setting the distance L<b>3</b> from the edge of the bonding pad <b>7</b> to the edge of the passivation film <b>29</b> on the side of the bonding pad <b>7</b>, as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, such that the passivation opening <b>30</b> is extended and enlarged, whereby the lead <b>11</b> does not interfere with the passivation film <b>29</b> at least on the side thereof where the bonding tool <b>18</b> is driven down, resulting in an improvement, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0290">That is, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the size L<b>3</b> is about 25 μm in an example of a semiconductor chip <b>1</b>, for example, a memory device. In this regard, since the size of the bonding pad <b>7</b> is 100 μm square and the size of the top end of the bonding tool <b>18</b> is equal to or less than that, the distance L<b>3</b> of the passivation film <b>29</b> from the pad <b>7</b>, as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, is desirably, for example, more than 125 μm.</p>
    <p num="p-0291">As described above, a suitable bonding property can be attained without the risk of damage to the passivation film <b>29</b> on the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> or to the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> or without deposition of ingredients of the passivation film <b>29</b> onto the bonding portion at the lower surface of the lead <b>11</b> which could result in contamination.</p>
    <p num="p-0292">Further, in a case where the leads <b>11</b> extend in both directions, the problem can also be coped with similarly by enlarging the distance from the opening edge of the bonding pad <b>7</b> to the edge of the passivation film <b>29</b> on the side of the bonding pad <b>7</b> at least on the side where the bonding tool is driven down. Enlargement of the space between the edges causes no problem even if applied to the opposite side to such an extent as to avoid exposing the circuit surface of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0293">7. Improvement of the Anchor Wiring</p>

    <p num="p-0295">For example, in the technique studied by the present inventors, in a pattern of a standard anchor wiring <b>31</b> on the terminal end of a notch, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, if the notch <b>27</b> is formed to be smaller than a designed value, there is a possibility that the lead will not be cut at the portion of the notch <b>27</b>, but the bonding strength between the wiring <b>10</b> and the tape <b>9</b> ahead of the notch in the standard anchor wiring <b>31</b> may not be sufficient to prevent a portion of the standard anchor wiring <b>31</b> to be peeled from the tape <b>9</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0296">On the other hand, in this Embodiment 1, the bonding strength between the wiring <b>10</b> and the tape <b>9</b> can be increased to obtain a stable cutting performance of the notch <b>27</b> by providing an enlarged anchor wiring <b>32</b> for enlarging the effective area in the portion for the anchor wiring at the terminal end as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0297">That is, the following improved examples of enlarged anchor wirings <b>32</b> are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0298">(1) An enlarged anchor wiring <b>32</b> is connected to a bump land <b>12</b> to an opposing wiring <b>11</b>.</p>

    <p num="p-0303">To assist in providing technical explanation of the wide elastomer structure, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> is a perspective view illustrating a structure of a standard elastomer, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> is a perspective view illustrating the state of appending a semiconductor chip to a standard elastomer, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> is a perspective view illustrating the structure of a wide elastomer, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> is a perspective view illustrating the state of appending a semiconductor chip to the wide elastomer and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> is a cross sectional view illustrating the state of appending a semiconductor chip to the wide elastomer.</p>
    <p num="p-0304">In the technique studied by the present inventors, the elastomer is bonded on both sides of a bonding pad <b>7</b> of a semiconductor chip <b>1</b> and, in a structure using a standard elastomer <b>33</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, there is a possibility that warping will occur in the flexible wiring substrate due to the effect of peripheral protrusions in a structure in which the surface of the elastomer <b>2</b> is smaller than that of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, and that the warping brings about a problem, for example, during the forming of the solder bumps <b>5</b> and the mounting of the substrate.</p>
    <p num="p-0305">On the other hand, in the structure of a wide elastomer <b>34</b> which is larger than the outer size of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> in the embodiment as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, the peripheral protrusions of the wide elastomer <b>34</b> are outside of the edges of the semiconductor chip, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, after appending the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>, and since the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> is bonded substantially to a flat portion of the wide elastomer <b>34</b>, warping of the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> can be avoided.</p>
    <p num="p-0306">Further, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, since a wide coating area of an adhesive <b>8</b> can be employed, the portion in which the adhesive <b>8</b> is not provided and which is left unbonded is reduced in size, and since the adhesive will extrude uniformly at the periphery of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> to form an adhesive bead <b>35</b>, it is possible to constitute a package of excellent moisture proofness and reliability without applying peripheral sealing.</p>
    <p num="p-0307">More particularly, the width of the protrusions at the periphery of the wide elastomer <b>34</b> is, for example, about 200 to 300 μm depending on the physical property of the material and, accordingly, the wide elastomer <b>34</b> extends over a larger range at the entire circumference at least by more than the protrusion width afforded by the chip size of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> in the Embodiment 1.</p>
    <p num="p-0308">Further, while the flatness is improved by forming the wide elastomer <b>34</b> sufficiently large, if the tape <b>9</b> is to be cut just at the outer circumference of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>, the tape <b>9</b> will be cut together with the wide elastomer <b>34</b> along a cutting line <b>36</b>, which is necessary to define the package outer shape.</p>
    <p num="p-0309">As described above, by using the wide elastomer <b>34</b> which is larger than the outer size of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>, warping of the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> can be suppressed, and the bondability of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> can be made stable to improve the moisture proofness and the reliability of the package.</p>

    <p num="p-0311">To assist in providing a technical explanation of the groove-filling technique of the elastomer, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> are perspective views illustrating the structure of the wide elastomer and the state of appending the semiconductor chip as described above, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> is a perspective view illustrating the structure after appending a semiconductor chip to a standard elastomer, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> is a cross sectional view thereof, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> is a perspective view illustrating a structure after appending a semiconductor chip to a wide elastomer, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> is a cross sectional view thereof, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> is a cross sectional view illustrating the concept of metal mask printing, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> is a plan view illustrating a metal mask of a standard elastomer, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> is a plan view illustrating a metal mask of a wide elastomer, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref> is a plan view illustrating a printed shape of a wide elastomer having plural bridge portions and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> is a plan view illustrating a potting position for groove-filling of the wide elastomer.</p>
    <p num="p-0312">For example, in the structure of a standard elastomer <b>33</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, in the technique studied by the present inventor, when an elastomer is formed by printing using a metal mask <b>37</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, in the structure of the standard elastomer <b>33</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, since a bridge portion <b>39</b> is always present across the printing area opening <b>38</b> of the metal mask <b>37</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, a groove <b>40</b> (space) surrounded by walls of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> and the elastomer is present below the tape suspended portion.</p>
    <p num="p-0313">Accordingly, when the window opening <b>23</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) is resin-encapsulated in a structure in which the groove <b>40</b> remains at the ends of the space defined by the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> and the elastomer, the sealant <b>6</b> will leak through the groove <b>40</b>, and so it is necessary to previously seal the open end portions by a method such as separate potting and then seal the window opening <b>23</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0314">As described above, the concept of printing by use of a metal mask <b>37</b> is designed to form the elastomer for a desired range to a desired thickness, by positioning and disposing a metal mask <b>37</b> having a printing area opening <b>38</b> at a predetermined position with respect to a flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b>, only for the printed portion as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> in the case of the standard elastomer <b>33</b> and as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> in the case of the wide elastomer <b>34</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0315">Accordingly, in the Embodiment 1, the wide elastomer <b>34</b> described above and shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> is printed by a metal mask <b>37</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>, in which a groove <b>40</b> surrounded by the walls of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> and the elastomer <b>2</b> can be narrowed by printing the elastomer having a restricted bridge portion <b>39</b> for the printing area opening <b>38</b> of the metal mask <b>37</b>. For example, the minimum value for the width of the groove <b>40</b> determined by the strength of the bridge portion <b>39</b> of the metal mask <b>37</b> is about 200 μm.</p>
    <p num="p-0316">Further, in a case of a structure in which the semiconductor chip is appended to the elastomer by coating the adhesive <b>8</b> on the main surface of the elastomer <b>2</b>, if the adhesive <b>8</b> is coated in a sufficient amount, excessive adhesive <b>8</b> will fill the groove <b>40</b> in response to the pressure created upon appending to make the window opening <b>23</b> a closed space, so that the window opening <b>23</b> can be sealed without applying sealing.</p>
    <p num="p-0317">Further, the groove-fillage can be improved by restricting the bridge portion <b>39</b> of the metal mask <b>37</b> thereby narrowing the groove <b>40</b>, but this results in a side effect of lowering the strength of the metal mask <b>37</b>. However, by providing a plurality of bridge positions on one side to produce the construction as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>, the strength of the metal mask <b>37</b> can be improved without changing the width of the groove <b>40</b> although the number of the grooves <b>40</b> is increased.</p>
    <p num="p-0318">Further, with an aim toward improving the groove-fillage, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>, when resin, adhesive or the like is potted, for example, at the potting position <b>42</b> of the groove <b>40</b> of the elastomer to form a stopping dam for the sealant flow just before appending the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>, the groove-fillage can be improved still further.</p>
    <p num="p-0319">Further, in a case of filling by potting before sealing the window opening <b>23</b> after appending and bonding of the semiconductor chip as in the technique studied above, the sealing performance can be improved outstandingly by restricting the width of the groove <b>40</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0320">As described above, the groove-fillage can be improved, particularly, by restricting the bridge portion <b>39</b> of the metal mask <b>37</b> thereby narrowing the groove <b>40</b> of the elastomer and, further, the groove-fillage can be improved even more by previously forming a stopping dam for the sealant flow to the potting position <b>42</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0321">10. Inner Lead Bonding Technique</p>
    <p num="p-0322">To assist in providing an explanation of the inner lead bonding technique, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref> is a cross sectional view illustrating a bonding portion produced by a standard lead bonding, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref> is a cross sectional view illustrating a bonding portion produced by using a stud bump, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref> are a cross sectional view and a plan view, respectively, illustrating a lead connection using soldering, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> are a cross sectional view and a perspective view, respectively, illustrating a lead connection using a solder or Au ball, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref> is a cross sectional view illustrating a connection using an Al or solder wire and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref> is a cross sectional view illustrating a connection using an Au wire.</p>
    <p num="p-0323">For example, in the technique studied by the present inventor, a lead <b>11</b> on which Au plating is provided is directly driven onto a bonding pad <b>7</b> and thermally press bonded using supersonic waves. In this case, if the bonding condition is poor or the shape of the bonding tool <b>18</b> is inadequate, there is the possibility of a problem in that the bonding strength is low or the bonding pad for a portion therebelow is subject to damage.</p>
    <p num="p-0324">On the contrary, in the Embodiment 1, the problems, for example, of bondability or damage caused by the bonding condition and the shape of the bonding tool <b>18</b> as described above can be overcome by adopting the following feature for the bonding state.</p>
    <p num="p-0325">That is, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref> shows an example of using a stud bump <b>43</b>. This example has a feature of using a semiconductor chip <b>1</b> having the stud bump <b>43</b> formed previously by a plating method or a ball bonding method onto a bonding pad <b>7</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>, causing the bondability to be improved and, further, preventing damage to the bonding pad.</p>
    <p num="p-0326">Further, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref> are examples of a connection for the lead <b>11</b> using solder and showing a connection state in which the lead <b>11</b> is surrounded with solder <b>44</b>. This example concerns a technique for connecting a bonding pad <b>7</b> comprising Al or the like of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> and an electrode of the tape <b>9</b> such as TAB as a CSP substrate. A method of feeding the solder in this example includes a method of connecting the solder <b>44</b> with the bonding pad <b>7</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> using the tape <b>9</b> on which the solder <b>44</b> is already present so as to surround the lead <b>11</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0327">For the connection method, it is desirable for the shape of the solder <b>44</b> provided on the tape <b>9</b>, such as a TAB, to be made as flat as possible at the surface in contact with the bonding pad <b>7</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> in the connection method by pressurizing and heating using a bonder. Further, in a connection method using a reflow furnace, solder paste or flux is provided at the surface of the bonding pad <b>7</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> so as to be in contact with the solder <b>44</b> of the tape <b>9</b>, such as a TAB.</p>
    <p num="p-0328">Then, in the case of feeding the solder <b>44</b> using solder paste, the solder paste may be provided at the surface of the bonding pad <b>7</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> by printing or by using a syringe. In this case, the tape <b>9</b>, such as a TAB, may be bonded previously or subsequently providing that the lead <b>11</b> of the tape <b>9</b> is in contact with the solder <b>44</b> when the tape <b>9</b> is bonded to the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0329">Further, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> show a connection technique having a feature of connecting a lead <b>11</b> of a tape <b>9</b>, such as a TAB, onto a bonding pad <b>7</b> of a semiconductor chip <b>1</b> by using a stud bump, such as a solder or Au ball <b>45</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0330">Further, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref> shows an example of connecting a wiring <b>10</b> of a flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> and a bonding pad <b>7</b> of a semiconductor chip <b>1</b> by using an Al or solder wire <b>46</b>. Further, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref> shows an example of connecting a wiring <b>10</b> of a flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> and a bonding pad <b>7</b> of a semiconductor chip <b>1</b> by using an Au wire <b>47</b>. In the connection examples, the connection is enabled not by way of the inner lead bonding, such as a TAB, but under the concept of a typical wire bonding.</p>
    <p num="p-0331">11. Lead Design Technique Capable of Forming an S-shape with No Tool Return</p>
    <p num="p-0332">To assist in providing an explanation of the lead design technique capable of forming an S-shape with no tool return, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a cross sectional view illustrating a trace of a bonding tool upon forming a standard S-shaped lead as explained previously, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref> is a perspective view for explaining the lead design, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref> is a perspective view illustrating deformation of a lead after bonding, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref> is a chart illustrating a relationship between a lead size and a bending stress ratio and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 80</figref> are cross sectional views illustrating the deformed shape of a lead in accordance with the bending stress ratio.</p>
    <p num="p-0333">More particularly, as explained also in connection with the technique for the planar S-shaped lead <b>26</b> in the technique studied by the present inventor, it is necessary for forming the S-shaped configuration of the lead <b>11</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, to laterally displace the bonding tool <b>18</b>, namely, a special bonding tool trace <b>25</b> including a tool return is required.</p>
    <p num="p-0334">On the contrary, in the Embodiment 1, if the size of a lead <b>11</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref> is defined, for example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref>, the bending stress ratio α will fall within a desired range of from 1.2 to 1.5 and a suitable S-shaped configuration for the lead <b>11</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref> can be formed by merely driving down the bonding tool <b>18</b> vertically with no tool return. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>, there are shown a tape end <b>48</b>, an end <b>49</b> on the side of the tape and an end <b>50</b> on the side of the chip.</p>
    <p num="p-0335">For example, in the example of embodiment (1), the bending stress ratio α=1.26 at the size: taper length L<b>1</b>=100 μm, wiring length L<b>2</b>=380 μm, taper width b<b>1</b>=65 μm, lead width b<b>2</b>=38 μm and lead thickness h=18 μm. In the same manner, the ratio is 1.25 in the embodiment (2), 1.26 in the embodiment (3), 1.31 in the embodiment (4) and 1.46 in the embodiment (5).</p>
    <p num="p-0336">On the contrary, in the studied technique, at the size: taper length L<b>1</b>=100 μm, wiring length L<b>2</b>=280 μm, taper width b<b>1</b>=60 μm, lead width b<b>2</b>=38 μm and lead thickness h=18 μm, the bending stress ratio α is 1.02, for example, in the example (1) and 1.13 in the example (2) which is out of the range of 1.2 to 1.5.</p>
    <p num="p-0337">As described above, since the bending stress is concentrated to an intermediate portion of the lead <b>11</b> in the wiring operation within the range of the bending stress ratio α from 1.2 to 1.5, a moderately distorted satisfactory wiring state is attained. On the other hand, if the bending stress ratio α is less than 1.2 as in the studied technique, since the bending stress is concentrated at the tape end <b>48</b> of the lead <b>11</b>, it results in a stiffened state. Further, if the ratio exceeds 1.5, the bending stress is concentrated only at the intermediate portion of the lead <b>11</b> resulting in a state of a small radius of curvature which can not be said to be a satisfactory wiring state.</p>
    <p num="p-0338"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 80</figref> show the deformed shape of the lead in accordance with the bending stress ratio α concretely. At first, when the bonding tool <b>18</b> is merely driven down vertically to contact the lead of initial shape before wiring shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref>, since the bending stress is concentrated on the tape end <b>48</b> of the lead <b>11</b>, for example, in the wiring operation at α&lt;0.9, an extremely stiffened wiring state is formed as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref>. Accordingly, since high repeating stresses are exerted on the lead <b>11</b> during the temperature cycle after wiring, the fatigue life is extremely shortened.</p>
    <p num="p-0339">Further, since the bending stress is concentrated at the tape end <b>48</b> of the lead <b>11</b> in the wiring operation at 0.9≦α&lt;1.2 as in the technique studied by the present inventor, a somewhat stiffened wiring state is formed as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 78</figref>. Accordingly, since high repeating stresses are exerted on the lead <b>11</b> during the temperature cycle after the wiring, fatigue life is shortened.</p>
    <p num="p-0340">On the contrary, since the bending stress is concentrated at an intermediate portion of the lead <b>11</b> during the wiring operation at 1.2≦α&lt;1.5 as in the Embodiment 1, a moderately distorted wiring state as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 79</figref> is formed. Accordingly, since no high repeating stresses are exerted on the lead <b>11</b> during the temperature cycle after the wiring, the fatigue life is increased.</p>
    <p num="p-0341">Further, during wiring operation at 1.5&lt;α with an increased bending stress ratio, since the bending ratio is concentrated only at the intermediate portion of the lead <b>11</b>, a wiring state with a small radius of curvature as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 80</figref> is formed. Accordingly, since the initial strength of the bent portion is lowered, the fatigue life during the temperature cycle after wiring is shortened.</p>
    <p num="p-0342">As a result, an optimal wiring state with only a moderately distorted wiring shape is formed when the bending stress ratio is set within a range: 1.2≦α&lt;1.5 as in the Embodiment 1, and the temperature cycle life of the lead <b>11</b> can be increased.</p>
    <p num="p-0343">The bending stress ratio α is defined as a value formed by dividing the stress σ1 generated at the end <b>49</b> of the lead <b>11</b> on the side of the tape by a stress σ0 generated at the tape end <b>48</b> of the lead <b>11</b> upon conducting the operation of raising the lead <b>11</b> just above the bonding pad <b>7</b> with the bonding tool <b>18</b>. That is, the bending stress ratio α can be represented by the following formula based on the size of the lead <b>11</b> having a feature in the tapered shape:
<br>α=σ1/σ0<i>=b</i>1×(<i>L</i>2<i>−L</i>1)/(<i>b</i>2<i>×L</i>2)</p>
    <p num="p-0344">As described above, when the size and the shape of the lead <b>11</b> are designed such that the bending stress ratio α is from 1.2 to 1.5, a stable and suitable S-shaped wiring state can be formed by a simple driving down movement of a wire bonder like that in the technique for the planar S-shaped lead <b>26</b> described previously. Accordingly, since no special soft-modified wire bonder is required and the bonding tool trace <b>25</b> can also be simplified, an effect of shortening the contact time upon bonding can also be expected.</p>
    <p num="p-0345">12. Ni-platingless Lead</p>
    <p num="p-0346">To assist in providing a technical explanation of the Ni-platingless lead, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref> is a cross sectional view illustrating a connection portion of the lead, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref> is an enlarged cross sectional view illustrating a bent portion of a lead, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref> is an enlarged cross sectional view illustrating a bent portion of an Ni-platingless lead, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref> is an enlarged cross sectional view illustrating a press contact portion of a lead and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref> is an enlarged cross sectional view illustrating a press-contact portion of the Ni-platingless lead.</p>
    <p num="p-0347">As an example, in the technique studied by the present inventor, in the case of a cross sectional structure of a lead <b>11</b> in which Ni-plating is applied to a surface of a Cu core and an Au plating is applied thereon, wherein a Cu core lead is employed instead of a pure Au lead, since the Ni-plating layer is hard and brittle, if it is intended to produce an S-shaped lead configuration, there is the possibility of causing a crack <b>51</b> to occur at the bent portion of the lead <b>11</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref>, or the bonding pad <b>7</b> or a portion therebelow may be subjected to damage <b>52</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref>. The Ni-plating is formed as a barrier layer for preventing Cu atoms from diffusing to the Au plating surface.</p>
    <p num="p-0348">On the contrary, in the Embodiment 1, since both the hardness and the brittleness are reduced by using an Ni-platingless lead <b>11</b> in order to obtain the S-shaped configuration, the crack <b>51</b> is less likely to form the lead per se and, in addition, the damage <b>52</b> to the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> at the counter-bonding face can also be moderated.</p>
    <p num="p-0349">That is, in the connection state of the lead <b>11</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>, in the lead having the constitution of a Cu core <b>53</b>+Ni plating <b>54</b>+Au plating <b>55</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref> as an enlargement of the portion A in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>, the crack <b>51</b> is liable to be caused as the radius of curvature in the bent portion is smaller.

    <p num="p-0350">Further, also in a press-contact portion of the lead <b>11</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref>, illustrating an enlargement of the portion B in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>, the lead <b>11</b> has a constitution comprising: Cu core <b>53</b>+Ni plating <b>54</b>+Au plating <b>55</b>, and so damage <b>52</b> is liable to be caused at the periphery of a bonding pad <b>7</b>.

    <p num="p-0351">As described above, it is possible to suppress the occurrence of a crack <b>51</b> in the lead <b>11</b> and moderate the damage <b>52</b> to the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> while obtaining the S-shaped configuration, by constituting the lead <b>11</b> such that only one plating layer, for example, an Au plating is formed on the core material of the Cu core <b>53</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0352">Therefore, according to the semiconductor integrated circuit device in the Embodiment 1, excellent effects can be obtained as already explained by comparison with the package structure studied by the present inventor, in the CSP package technique of substantially the identical size with that of the semiconductor chip, in each of the technical items, namely: 1. Surface wiring structure, 2. Optimization of the tape edge position relative to the elastomer, 3. Optimization of outer size of the package, 4. Planar S-shaped lead, 5. Beam lead, 6. Peripheral PIQ size of bonding pad, 7. Improvement of anchor wiring, 8. Wide elastomer structure, 9. Elastomer groove-fillage technique, 10. Inner lead bonding technique, 11. Lead design technique capable of forming S-shaped configuration with no tool return and 12. NI-platingless lead.</p>
    <p num="p-0353">In the Embodiment 1, although various explanations have been made with reference to the drawings and the contents of various techniques on the premise of a particular surface wiring structure, the technical items 2 to 12 are not limited to the described surface wiring structure, but the technique of this invention is applicable also to general package structures, such as a rear face wiring structure. Accordingly, it can be expected that the same effect as explained with reference to all of the items can be obtained when the invention is applied to a general package structure.</p>
    <p num="p-0354">The package structure of the Embodiment 1 (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is shown for a case in which the elastomer <b>2</b> is larger than the outer shape of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>. In a case where the elastomer <b>2</b> is smaller than the outer shape of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 81</figref>, an improvement of the moisture proofness or the like can be obtained by forming a package structure in which the lateral sides of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> and the elastomer <b>2</b> are covered with a sealant <b>6</b>.</p>
    <heading>Embodiment 2</heading> <p num="p-0355"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref> are a cross sectional view and a perspective view, respectively, illustrating a rear face wiring solder resist structure in the semiconductor integrated circuit device of Embodiment 2 according to the present invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0356">The semiconductor integrated circuit device of the Embodiment 2 is a ball grid array type semiconductor package like that of the Embodiment 1, but it is different from the Embodiment 1 in that it is not based on the surface wiring technique, but is based on and provided for improving a rear face wiring structure. For instance, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref>, in a structure comprising an elastomer <b>2</b> (elastic structural material) bonded on a main surface of a semiconductor chip (not shown) and a flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> (wiring substrate) bonded to a main surface of the elastomer <b>2</b>, a solder resist <b>56</b> (insulation film) is formed on the rear face of the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0357">That is, the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> comprises a tape <b>9</b> (substrate base material) serving as a base material for the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> and wirings <b>10</b> bonded to the rear face of the tape <b>9</b>, in which the rear face of the wiring <b>10</b> is bonded by way of the solder resist <b>56</b> to the elastomer <b>2</b>. The solder resist <b>56</b> is composed of an insulation material, such as a light sensitive epoxy resin like that in the Embodiment 1.</p>
    <p num="p-0358">The feature of the package structure of the semiconductor integrated circuit device in the Embodiment 2 will be explained, including the structure and the process of manufacture in comparison with a package structure employing a technique studied by the present inventor.</p>
    <p num="p-0359">For instance, in the rear face wiring structure shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in the Embodiment 1 as the technique studied by the present inventor, since the elastomer <b>2</b> is formed directly on the main surface of the wirings <b>10</b> of the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b>, low molecular weight ingredients of the elastomer <b>3</b> bleed directly to the lead <b>11</b> and if they bleed as far as the bonding point of the lead <b>11</b>, there is a likelihood of extremely deteriorating the bondability (wire bonding stress) due to the contamination.</p>
    <p num="p-0360">Further, compared with the direct plating surface of the lead <b>11</b>, the surface of the tape <b>9</b> in which the wirings <b>10</b> are etched out between the leads <b>11</b> suffers from violent bleeding since the surface of the tape <b>9</b> is roughened also with an aim of improving the bondability between the tape <b>9</b> and the wirings <b>10</b>, and bleeding tends to be most violent at the edge portion of the lead <b>11</b> together with the effect of the surface tension.</p>
    <p num="p-0361">Further, in the rear face wiring structure in which the elastomer <b>2</b> is formed on an uneven surface of the wirings <b>10</b> caused by different levels between the portions with or without the wirings <b>10</b>, voids are liable to be left, for example, in the gap between the wirings, which may cause a degrading of the reliability.</p>
    <p num="p-0362">On the contrary, in the Embodiment 2, since the solder resist <b>56</b> is formed on the wirings <b>10</b> after forming the wirings <b>10</b> in the manufacturing step for the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b>, direct contact of the elastomer <b>2</b> with the wirings <b>10</b> can be prevented. In the same manner, contact of the elastomer <b>2</b> to the roughened surface of the tape <b>9</b> can also be prevented. This can suppress bleeding of the low molecular weight ingredients of the elastomer <b>2</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0363">Further, by coating the solder resist <b>56</b> on the uneven surface of the wirings <b>10</b> of the flexible wiring substrate, the surface of the wirings <b>10</b> is flattened to avoid a disadvantage, such as the creation of voids upon forming the elastomer <b>2</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0364">Accordingly, in the semiconductor integrated circuit device of the Embodiment 2, since the solder resist <b>56</b> is formed on the wirings <b>10</b> of the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> in the CSP semiconductor package technique based on the rear face wiring structure, it is possible to prevent the lowering of the bondability while preventing contamination to the lead <b>11</b>, thereby providing a package structure of high reliability with no voids.</p>

    <p num="p-0366">A semiconductor integrated circuit device in the Embodiment 3 adopts, instead of a semiconductor package having a structure in which the bonding pad is formed approximately at the center of the chip, as in the Embodiments 1 and 2 described above, a packaging structure using a semiconductor chip <b>1</b> <i>a </i>in which a pad is formed to the periphery of the chip, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</figref>, and in which bumps <b>5</b> <i>a </i>connected to the bonding pads to the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> <i>a </i>are disposed in a region inward of the outer circumference of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> <i>a</i>. The Embodiment 3 also has a structure which adopts the techniques from “1. Surface wiring structure” to “12.

    <p num="p-0367">That is, the semiconductor integrated circuit device in the Embodiment 3 is, for example, a 24 pin ball grid array type semiconductor package structure, in which an elastomer <b>2</b> <i>a </i>(elastic structural material), a flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> <i>a </i>(wiring substrate) having wirings <b>10</b> <i>a </i>formed on a tape <b>9</b> <i>a </i>and a solder resist <b>4</b> <i>a </i>(insulation film) are disposed on a main surface of a semiconductor chip <b>1</b> <i>a </i>formed with a plurality of bonding pads <b>7</b> <i>a </i>(external terminals), solder bumps <b>5</b> <i>a </i>(bump electrodes) are formed to an opening of the solder resist <b>4</b> <i>a</i>, and a portion for forming the bonding pads <b>7</b> <i>a </i>and lateral sides of the elastomer <b>2</b> <i>a </i>and the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> <i>a </i>are covered with a sealant <b>6</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0368">The semiconductor chip <b>1</b> <i>a </i>has a peripheral pad structure, for example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</figref>, in which a plurality of bonding pads <b>7</b> <i>a </i>are arranged in a square pattern along the outer circumference of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> <i>a</i>. Each bonding pad <b>7</b> <i>a </i>of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> <i>a </i>is connected electrically with a solder bump <b>5</b> <i>a </i>by way of the wiring <b>10</b> <i>a </i>of the flexible wiring substrate <b>3</b> <i>a</i>, which is connected at one end of the lead <b>11</b> <i>a </i>to the pad <b>7</b> <i>a </i>and joined at the bump land <b>12</b> <i>a </i>at the other end of the wiring <b>10</b> <i>a </i>to the bump <b>5</b> <i>a</i>.

    <p num="p-0369">Accordingly, in the semiconductor integrated circuit device of the Embodiment 3, excellent effects can be obtained for each of the technical items as explained for the Embodiments 1 and 2, although there is a difference in the semiconductor package structure relating to the fan-in peripheral pads. Particularly, in the fan-in package structure, a CSP structure package about the same size as the semiconductor chin <b>1</b> <i>a </i>can be attained similar to that in the Embodiments 1 and 2.</p>

    <p num="p-0392">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82</figref> or <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 83(</figref> <i>c</i>), when the elastomer <b>3</b>′ is attached to the thin film wiring substrate <b>4</b>′, the elastomer protruding parts <b>3</b> <i>b</i>′ which protrude beyond the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>′ in the elastomer <b>3</b>′ are laid over the substrate protruding parts <b>4</b> <i>b</i>′ of the thin film wiring substrate <b>4</b>′.</p>
    <p num="p-0393">The sealing parts <b>5</b>′ are formed by sealing the electrode pads <b>1</b> <i>b</i>′ of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>′ and the leads <b>4</b> <i>c</i>′ connected to them, the whole of the opposite side faces <b>1</b> <i>c</i>′ in the short side direction of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>′, and the area near both ends of the two opposite side faces <b>1</b> <i>c</i>′ in the longitudinal direction of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>′ with sealing resin. As the substrate protruding parts <b>4</b> <i>b</i>′ of the thin film wiring substrate <b>4</b>′ are formed in the vicinity of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>′, the sealing resin forms a bridge between (straddles) the substrate protruding parts <b>4</b> <i>b</i>′ and the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>′ in the sealing parts <b>5</b>′.</p>
    <p num="p-0394">The specification of each part of the CSP<b>11</b>′ (materials, dimensions and thickness, etc.) will now be described referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 84(</figref> <i>a</i>, b, c, d). It should, however, be understood that these specifications are only given as examples, and the invention is not to be construed as being limited in any way by them.</p>
    <p num="p-0395">The tape which is the base material of the thin film wiring substrate <b>4</b>′ is formed of polyimide resin, and its thickness is of the order of 25 to 75 μm. The wiring <b>4</b> <i>d</i>′ (comprising the leads <b>4</b> <i>c</i>′ and bump lands <b>4</b> <i>f</i>′) provided in the thin film wiring substrate <b>4</b>′ is copper foil having a thickness of the order of 18 to 25 μm. The wiring <b>4</b> <i>d</i>′ is plated with Au plating to a thickness of 1.5 μm on both sides, or Au/Ni plating of different thickness on the side of the electrode pad <b>1</b> <i>b </i>and the side of the bump electrode <b>2</b>′.</p>
    <p num="p-0396">In the thin film wiring substrate <b>4</b>′ used in the sixth embodiment, the wiring <b>4</b> <i>d</i>′ is a single layer structure as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 83(</figref> <i>a</i>). It is also “single layer back wiring” wherein the wiring <b>4</b>D′ is formed only on the under surface of the tape base material (tape base material <b>4</b> <i>g</i>′ in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 87(</figref> <i>a</i>)).</p>
    <p num="p-0397">The elastomer <b>3</b>′ is a three-layer structure (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 128</figref>) comprising a base layer (skeleton layer <b>3</b> <i>d</i>′, referred to also as core layer) having adhesive layers <b>3</b> <i>e</i>′ on both sides. Examples of its application are specification (1) and specification (2) shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 84(</figref> <i>a</i>, b, c, d). Details of specification (1) are given in Japanese Patent Application No. Hei 9-149106 and details of specification (2) are given in Japanese Patent Application No. Hei 8-136159.</p>
    <p num="p-0398">The elastomer <b>3</b>′ used in the first embodiment is also colorless, therefore the elastomer <b>3</b>′ according to the first embodiment is an effectively transparent structure which transmits light.</p>
    <p num="p-0399">From the viewpoints of porosity and water repelling properties, it is also desirable that the base layer (skeleton layer <b>3</b> <i>d</i>′) of the elastomer <b>3</b>′ is formed of a porous fluoride resin, i.e. it is desirable to use the elastomer of specification (1).</p>
    <p num="p-0400">Herein, the elastomer <b>3</b>′ formed from a porous fluoride resin comprises a skeleton layer <b>3</b> <i>d</i>′ having a 3-dimensional mesh structure.</p>
    <p num="p-0401">This 3-dimensional mesh structure is a non-woven fabric formed by 3-dimensional entwining of a fibrous compound.</p>
    <p num="p-0402">The sealing resin, which is the sealing material for forming the sealing parts <b>5</b>, has the specification (1) or the specification (2) shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 84(</figref> <i>a, b, c, d</i>).</p>
    <p num="p-0403">During cure bake after sealing, voids tend to form in the solvent type liquid resin when the solvent vaporizes, and it is therefore desirable to use the resin of specification (1).</p>
    <p num="p-0404">The sealing resin used in the CSP<b>11</b>′ of the first embodiment is a material of relatively high volatility. However, it is possible to use sealing resin of high volatility by increasing the displacement time of a potting nozzle, not shown, during the coating step (e.g. approximately 30 seconds for coating the six electrode pads <b>1</b> <i>b</i>′ on one side of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>′), or by heating the sealing resin, and it is thus possible to form a bridge of sealing resin between the substrate protruding parts <b>4</b> <i>b </i>and semiconductor chip <b>1</b>′.</p>
    <p num="p-0405">It is also preferable to use a resin containing silica to reduce residual stress due to contraction during seal cure, and more preferable to use a resin containing at least 50 weight percent silica.</p>
    <p num="p-0406">The material of the bump electrode <b>2</b>′ is Sn/Pb eutectic solder or other high melting point solder, or Au-plated Ni or the like, and its diameter is of the order of 0.3–0.6 mm.</p>
    <p num="p-0407">The CSP<b>11</b>′ (semiconductor device) of the first embodiment offers the following advantages.</p>
    <p num="p-0408">The substrate body <b>4</b> <i>a</i>′ and substrate protruding parts <b>4</b> <i>b</i>′ of the thin film wiring substrate <b>4</b>′ are formed in a one-piece construction. As the substrate protruding parts <b>4</b> <i>b</i>′ are not a separate structure from the substrate body <b>4</b> <i>a</i>′, it is not necessary to form the substrate protruding parts <b>4</b> <i>b</i>′ from costly materials.</p>
    <p num="p-0409">Therefore, the cost of manufacturing the CSP<b>11</b>′ (semiconductor device) is reduced.</p>
    <p num="p-0410">As the substrate protruding parts <b>4</b> <i>b</i>′ protrude beyond the openings <b>4</b> <i>e</i>′ in the thin film wiring substrate <b>4</b>′, the sealing parts <b>5</b>′ may be formed as a bridge between the substrate protruding parts <b>4</b> <i>b</i>′ and the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>′ when the sealing resin is applied via the openings <b>4</b> <i>e′. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0411">As a stable seal is obtained sealing properties are improved and, as a result, humidity resistance is more reliable.</p>
    <p num="p-0412">The sealing resin contains at least 50 weight percent silica, so residual stress due to contraction in cure bake can be reduced. Therefore, the reliability of the sealing parts <b>5</b> is improved.</p>
    <p num="p-0413">The base layer of the elastomer <b>3</b>′ which forms the elastic structure is constructed of a porous fluoride resin, and the two opposite side faces <b>3</b> <i>a </i>of the elastomer <b>3</b>′ in the same direction as the longitudinal direction of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>′ are exposed to the outside. Therefore, water vapor due to moisture absorbed during reflow can be released to the outside, reflow properties are improved, and entry of water into the CSP<b>11</b>′ can be prevented by the water repelling properties of the fluoride in the porous fluoride resin. As a result, degradation of electrical properties of the CSP<b>11</b>′ is reduced.</p>
    <p num="p-0414">Next, the method of manufacturing the CSP<b>11</b>′ (semiconductor device) of the first embodiment will be described together with the advantages gained therefrom.</p>
    <p num="p-0415">The method will be described in the sequence shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 104</figref> referring to the process conditions shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0416">The elastomer <b>3</b>′ shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 91</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 93</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94</figref> comprises openings <b>3</b> <i>c</i>. These figures describe the method of manufacturing the CSP<b>16</b>′, <b>17</b>′ of the Embodiments 11 or 12 to be described later, but since the Embodiment 6 is the same as regards the basic manufacturing method, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 91</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 93</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94</figref> will be used also in the Embodiment 6.</p>
    <p num="p-0417">First, the thin film wiring substrate <b>4</b>′ comprising the substrate body <b>4</b> <i>a</i>′ comprising the wiring <b>4</b> <i>d</i>′, and the substrate protruding parts <b>4</b> <i>b</i>′ which protrude beyond the openings <b>4</b> <i>e</i>′ in which the leads <b>4</b> <i>c</i>′ are connected to the wiring <b>4</b> <i>d</i>′, is provided.</p>
    <p num="p-0418">The method of manufacturing the thin film wiring substrate <b>4</b>′ will be described referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 87</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 89</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0419">First, the tape base material <b>4</b> <i>g</i>′ comprising the polyimide resin shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 87(</figref> <i>a</i>) is prepared. An adhesive for attaching the copper foil <b>4</b> <i>h</i>′ shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 88(</figref> <i>b</i>) is coated on the top and under surfaces of this base tape <b>4</b> <i>g′. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0420">Next, preparing holes <b>4</b> <i>i</i>′ for tape feed are formed at an approximately equal interval on both sides of the tape base material <b>4</b> <i>g</i>′ as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 87(</figref> <i>b</i>).</p>
    <p num="p-0421">Next, twelve bump openings <b>4</b> <i>j</i>′ and two wiring join holes <b>4</b> <i>e</i>′ on both sides are formed by stamping as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 88(</figref> <i>a</i>) and the copper foil <b>4</b> <i>h</i>′ is laminated on the tape base material <b>4</b> <i>g</i>′ as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 88(</figref> <i>b</i>).</p>
    <p num="p-0422">The copper foil <b>4</b> <i>h</i>′ is then fashioned into a desired pattern by etching as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 89(</figref> <i>a</i>) so as to form a wiring pattern.</p>
    <p num="p-0423">This forms the bump lands <b>4</b> <i>f</i>′ and a power supply line <b>4</b> <i>k′. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0424">In order to make the aforesaid gold plating electrically react after plating the copper foil <b>4</b> <i>h</i>′, adjacent power supply lines <b>4</b> <i>k</i>′ must be connected together.</p>
    <p num="p-0425">After etching the copper foil <b>4</b> <i>h</i>′ to form the wiring pattern, the copper foil <b>4</b> <i>h</i>′ is gold plated. The specification of this gold plating is that of the wiring plating shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 84(</figref> <i>a</i>, b, c, d). It may be gold plating having a thickness of 1.5 μm (wiring plating (<b>1</b>) shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 84(</figref> <i>a, b, c, d</i>)), gold/nickel differential thickness plating (wiring plating (<b>2</b>) shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 84(</figref> <i>a, b, c, d</i>)), or another type of plating.</p>
    <p num="p-0426">The wiring leads which are connected together as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 89(</figref> <i>a</i>) are then cut by a punch die <b>6</b> <i>a</i>′ of a cutter <b>6</b>′ shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 92(</figref> <i>a</i>) so as to separate the leads <b>4</b> <i>c</i>′ as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 89(</figref> <i>b</i>).</p>
    <p num="p-0427">As regards the width of the cutting blade of the punch die <b>6</b>′, it is desirable to use a small cutting blade having a width of the order of 50 to 200 μm and more preferably 100 to 150 μm so that the leads <b>4</b> <i>c</i>′ can be fashioned into a beam shape <b>41</b>′ after cutting as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 92(</figref> <i>b</i>).</p>
    <p num="p-0428">By using a small cutting blade of the order of 125 μm, the cut parts of the leads <b>4</b> <i>c</i>′ can be formed with a dimension of the order of 125 μm, and as a result, the distance between the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>′ and the substrate protruding parts <b>4</b> <i>b</i>′ can be shortened when the semiconductor chip <b>1</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82</figref>) is mounted.</p>
    <p num="p-0429">The sealing areas of the sealing parts <b>105</b> can therefore be made narrow, so sealing properties are improved.</p>
    <p num="p-0430">Also as the distance between the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>′ and the substrate protruding parts <b>4</b> <i>b</i>′ can be made short, the CSP<b>11</b>′ can be made compact.</p>
    <p num="p-0431">By cutting so as to fashion the leads <b>4</b> <i>c</i>′ into the beam shape <b>41</b>′ shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 92(</figref> <i>b</i>), the thin film wiring substrate <b>4</b>′ shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 89(</figref> <i>b</i>) is produced.</p>
    <p num="p-0432">The detailed structure of the thin film wiring substrate <b>4</b>′ used in the sixth embodiment will now be described referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 89</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 108</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0433">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 108</figref>, four long holes <b>4</b> <i>q</i>′ effectively corresponding to the four sides of the substrate body <b>4</b> <i>a</i>′ are formed around the substrate body <b>4</b> <i>a′. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0434">The purpose of these holes <b>4</b> <i>q</i>′ is to reduce the cross-sectional area when the substrate body <b>4</b> <i>a</i>′ is cut off, improve ease of cutting, and to lessen distortion when winding up or cutting the thin film wiring substrate <b>4</b>′ which is in the form of a long thin tape.</p>
    <p num="p-0435">Positioning holes <b>4</b> <i>p</i>′ for positioning during cutting are provided outside the upper and lower long holes <b>4</b> <i>q</i>′ of the substrate body <b>4</b> <i>a</i>′ (according to this embodiment a total of three holes is provided, i.e. one upper one and two lower ones), but there is no limit on the number of these positioning holes <b>4</b> <i>p</i>′ if they are provided outside both the upper and lower long holes <b>4</b> <i>q′. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0436">Recognition patterns <b>4</b> <i>n</i>′ formed of the same copper foil as the wiring pattern are also provided in these upper and lower long holes <b>4</b> <i>q</i>′ of the substrate body <b>4</b> <i>a′. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0437">These recognition patterns <b>4</b> <i>n</i>′ are used to recognize the position of the thin film wiring substrate <b>4</b>′ during cutting, etc., and are such that they can be recognized also from the reverse side of the thin film wiring substrate <b>4</b>′ (side on which there is no wiring pattern) during bonding. Specifically, they straddle the ends of the long holes <b>4</b> <i>q</i>′ so that they can be recognized from the top surface and under surface of the thin film wiring substrate <b>4</b>′.</p>
    <p num="p-0438">The thin film wiring substrate <b>4</b>′ shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 108</figref> comprises plural substrate bodies <b>4</b> <i>a</i>′ arranged horizontally in a row with respect to the feed direction, however plural rows of the substrate bodies <b>4</b> <i>a</i>′ (e.g. two) may be arranged horizontally.</p>
    <p num="p-0439">In this case, the efficiency of manufacturing the CPU<b>11</b> may be improved.</p>
    <p num="p-0440">Subsequently, thin film wiring substrate supply <b>20</b>′ and elastomer supply <b>21</b>′ shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85</figref> are performed, and elastomer attachment <b>22</b>′ is performed.</p>
    <p num="p-0441">To attach the elastomer <b>3</b>′, the substrate body <b>4</b> <i>a</i>′ of the thin film wiring substrate <b>4</b>′ and elastomer <b>3</b>′ are joined as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90(</figref> <i>a</i>) based on elastomer attachment conditions whereof an example is given in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 86</figref>. In this way, the thin film wiring substrate <b>4</b> is assembled with the elastomer <b>3</b>′. When the elastomer <b>3</b>′ is attached, there may be three positional relationships of the elastomer <b>3</b>′ and substrate body <b>4</b> <i>a</i>′ as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 93(</figref> <i>a</i>), <b>93</b>(<i>b</i>), <b>93</b>(<i>c</i>).</p>
    <p num="p-0442">First, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 93(</figref> <i>a</i>) shows the case where the edge of the substrate body <b>4</b> <i>a</i>′ protrudes beyond the elastomer <b>3</b>′ by an protruding amount P.</p>
    <p num="p-0443"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 93(</figref> <i>b</i>) shows the case where the edge of the substrate body <b>4</b> <i>a</i>′ and the edge of the elastomer are perfectly aligned. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 93(</figref> <i>c</i>) shows the case where the edge of the substrate body <b>4</b> <i>a</i>′ falls short of the elastomer <b>3</b>′ by an amount Q.</p>
    <p num="p-0444">In general, during heat curing after applying a sealing material (herein, a sealing resin), volatile components of the sealing material are produced as volatile gases. As the specific gravity of these volatile gases is less than that of the sealing material, the volatile gases escape to the outside from the upper part of the sealing material.</p>
    <p num="p-0445">However, when a P value predetermined range described hereafter is exceeded and the edge of the elastomer <b>3</b>′ does not protrude to the edge of the substrate body <b>4</b> <i>a</i>′ (P&gt;300 μm), volatile gases produced further inside than the edge of the substrate body <b>4</b> <i>a</i>′ cannot escape to the outside of the sealing material as the upper part is obstructed by the edge of the substrate body <b>4</b> <i>a</i>′, so these gases remain as bubbles in the sealing material.</p>
    <p num="p-0446">After heat curing of the sealing material, part of the components of the volatile gases in the bubbles gradually escape to the outside through minute (intermolecular) gaps in the sealing material, so the internal pressure of the bubbles is released.</p>
    <p num="p-0447">As a result, voids are formed in the sealing material where the bubbles occur.</p>
    <p num="p-0448">The voids create unfilled spaces in areas which should be filled by sealing material, and have an adverse effect on the humidity resistance and temperature cycle reliability of the semiconductor device.</p>
    <p num="p-0449">It is therefore desirable that the value of P lies within a P value predetermined range of O≦P≦300 μm, and preferably O≦P≦100 μm, so that the escape path of the volatile gases is not obstructed by the substrate body <b>4</b> <i>a</i>′, and so that the volatile gases produced can be released outside the sealing material.</p>
    <p num="p-0450">If this is done, voids are not formed in the sealing material.</p>
    <p num="p-0451">On the other hand, when a Q value predetermined range described hereafter is exceeded and the edge of the elastomer <b>3</b>′ protrudes beyond the edge of the substrate body <b>4</b> <i>a</i>′ (Q&gt;100 μm), part of the leads <b>4</b> <i>c</i>′ is fixed by the elastomer <b>3</b>′, so a correct wiring configuration cannot be formed when the leads <b>4</b> <i>c</i>′ are bonded.</p>
    <p num="p-0452">This has an adverse effect on temperature cycle reliability.</p>
    <p num="p-0453">It is therefore desirable that the position of the edge of the elastomer <b>3</b>′ relative to the edge of the substrate body <b>4</b> <i>a</i>′ is within a Q value predetermined range of for example 0≦Q≦100 μm, and preferably 0≦Q≦50 μm, so that correct bonding of the leads <b>4</b> <i>c</i>′ can be performed.</p>
    <p num="p-0454">Hence, by ensuring that P and Q are within the predetermined ranges, a CSP<b>11</b>′ of high reliability can be manufactured free of voids in the sealing material and wherein the leads <b>4</b> <i>c</i>′ are correctly bonded.</p>
    <p num="p-0455">Subsequently, chip supply <b>23</b>′ (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85</figref>) is performed wherein the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>′ is supplied having the electrode pads <b>1</b> <i>b</i>′ on the outer periphery of the main surface <b>1</b> <i>a</i>′ as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 83(</figref> <i>a</i>). Chip attachment <b>24</b>′ shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85</figref> is then performed based on the chip attachment conditions shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 86</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0456">Herein, in the chip attachment <b>24</b>′, the main surface <b>1</b> <i>a</i>′ of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>′ is joined to the elastomer <b>3</b>′ as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 83(</figref> <i>a</i>) leaving the electrode pads <b>1</b> <i>b</i>′ of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>′ exposed in the openings <b>4</b> <i>e</i>′ of the thin film wiring substrate <b>4</b>′, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0457">Specifically, the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>′ is attached to the top of the elastomer <b>3</b>′ as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90(</figref> <i>b</i>).</p>
    <p num="p-0458">Subsequently, an elastomer cure bake <b>25</b>′ shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85</figref> is performed based on the post-chip attachment cure conditions shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 86</figref> so as to raise the joining strength of the elastomer <b>3</b>′ and semiconductor chip <b>1</b>′.</p>
    <p num="p-0459">Next, inner lead connections <b>26</b>′ shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85</figref> is performed based on the inner lead connection conditions shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 86</figref>. Two sets of inner lead connection conditions (1) and (2) are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 86</figref>, however the inner lead connection conditions are not limited to this.</p>
    <p num="p-0460">First, a bonding tool <b>7</b>′ is lowered to a predetermined position as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94(</figref> <i>a</i>), then one of the leads <b>4</b> <i>c</i>′ of the thin film wiring substrate <b>4</b>′ is pressed onto the corresponding electrode pad <b>1</b> <i>b</i>′ on the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>′ by the bonding tool <b>7</b>′ so that the lead <b>4</b> <i>c</i>′ and the electrode pad <b>1</b> <i>b</i>′ are electrically connected.</p>
    <p num="p-0461">The bonding method of the first embodiment is single bonding.</p>
    <p num="p-0462">After bonding, the lead <b>4</b> <i>c</i>′ is pushed up by the bonding tool <b>7</b>′ so that it is just above the electrode pad <b>1</b> <i>b</i>′. If a value obtained by dividing the stress produced in the taper-shaped tip of the lead <b>4</b> <i>c</i>′ by the stress produced at the edge of the substrate body <b>4</b> <i>a</i>′ is defined as a bending stress ratio alpha, this bending stress ratio α is given by the following expression from the dimensions of the taper-shaped lead <b>4</b> <i>c′:</i>
<br>(α=: <i>L</i>×(<i>K−J</i>)/(<i>M×K</i>)(FIG. <b>94</b>(<i>a</i>)).</p>
    <p num="p-0463">The dimensions and shape of the lead <b>4</b> <i>c</i>′ are therefore designed such that the bending stress ratio α is within the range 1.0 to 1.75.</p>

    <p num="p-0667">The remaining features of the construction of the semiconductor device (CSP) according to Embodiment 17 are identical to those of the CSP shown in Embodiments 6 to 16, so their description will not be repeated.</p>
    <p num="p-0668">It should be noted that it is not absolutely necessary for the elastomer <b>3</b>′ in the CSP of the twenty-second embodiment to contain a coloring agent. However, by arranging for the elastomer <b>3</b>′ to contain a predetermined amount of coloring agent according to the twenty-second embodiment, the transmittance of the elastomer <b>3</b>′ can be lowered without affecting basic properties of the elastomer <b>3</b>′ such as elastic modulus, thermal expansion coefficient, flame-retarding properties and humidity absorption. In this way, the circuit of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>′ may be obscured from light. As a result, ultraviolet radiation, etc. which may cause incorrect operation of the semiconductor chip <b>1</b>′ can be blocked, and stability of the electrical circuit of the CSP is enhanced.</p>
    <p num="p-0669">By using carbon as coloring agent, a predetermined light obscuring effect may be obtained by a small addition amount, so deterioration of the basic characteristics of the elastomer <b>3</b>′ may be suppressed to the minimum.

    <p num="p-0673">In an elastomer <b>3</b>′ wherein the outer upper and lower layers are film layers, the use of this five layer structure further reduces the rigidity of the film layers (adhesive layers <b>3</b> <i>e</i>′).

Typical applications of these devices are modules and cards, but it will be understood that they may be applied to products other than modules and cards.</p>
    <p num="p-0799">The techniques in the Embodiments 1–30, also, can be combined as required.</p>
    <p num="p-0800">The number of the solder bumps serving as external connection terminals of the semiconductor package and the bonding pads serving as external terminals of the semiconductor chip electrically connected with the solder bumps are not restricted only to those described in connection with the embodiments, but they may be properly modified depending on or in accordance with the specification of the packages, such as the integrated circuits formed on the semiconductor chip.</p>
    <p num="p-0801">Further, regarding the materials, for example, for the elastomer forming the elastic structural material, the tape for the flexible wiring substrate, the wiring and lead plating, the solder resist serving as the insulation film and the solder bump serving as a bump electrode, the invention is also applicable in a case of using other materials having respective properties.</p>
    <p num="p-0802">For example, as the solder resist, there can be mentioned a resin mixture comprising an acrylic resin and an epoxy resin, the resin mixture described above with addition of a filler, melamine, acryl, polystyrol and polyimide, as well as polyurethane and silicone; although, it is necessary that they have a property of withstanding the soldering temperature and have a resistance to the exposure of a flux and a cleaning solvent.</p>
    <p num="p-0803">Advantageous effects obtained by typical examples among those disclosed, although not limited thereto, in accordance with the present invention are briefly explained below.</p>
    <p num="p-0804">(1) Since the elastic structural material is disposed on the flat surface on the rear face of the substrate base material by adopting a surface wiring structure in which the elastic structural material is disposed on the rear face of the substrate base material of the wiring substrate, and the insulation film is formed on the main surface of the wirings formed on the main surface of the substrate base material, the elastic structural material can be mounted with a higher accuracy and stably to the substrate base material in a voidless manner and, since the size and the shape of the elastic structural material are made stable, the bonding step for the semiconductor chip is also stable, thereby enabling assembling at a higher yield.</p>
    <p num="p-0805">(2) Since the signal wiring layer and the power source ground wiring layer can be separated into different layers by making the wirings of the wiring substrate into a multi-wiring layer structure, an excellent electric characteristic in view of noise resistance can be attained.</p>
    <p num="p-0806">(3) Since external terminals of the semiconductor chip can be disposed at the central portion or the peripheral portion, and the bump electrodes connected to the external terminals can be disposed to the inside, outside or both of the regions outward of the outer circumference of the semiconductor chip, the invention is applicable to package structures of various types and variations.</p>
    <p num="p-0807">(4) Since the edge position of the substrate base material can be optimized relative to the elastic structural material by setting the distance between the end of the elastic structural material of the semiconductor chip on the side of the external terminals and the end of the substrate base material of the wirings substrate based on the ingredients of the elastic structural material, a variation in the height of the bump electrodes is not caused, thereby avoiding any difficulty in filling the sealant caused by an enlarged sealing region for the opening of the elastic structural material and it is possible to prevent contamination of wirings caused by the bleeding of ingredients or evaporative ingredients of the elastic structural material.</p>
    <p num="p-0808">(5) Since the outer size of the package can be optimized by setting the relation for the distance M<b>2</b> between the end of the substrate base material of the wiring substrate and the end of the elastic structural material and for the distance M<b>1</b> between the end of the semiconductor chip and the end of the substrate base material at the outer circumference of the semiconductor integrated circuit device within a range: M<b>1</b>&gt;M<b>2</b>&gt;0, the outermost circumference of the package is not formed by the semiconductor chip, so that a possibility of inducing chip cracks is reduced during the assembling step, as well as during withdrawal and insertion of receptacles and tray transportation, and the circuit surface of the semiconductor chip is not exposed to the outside, thereby making it possible to improve the reliability. Further, since the peripheral protrusions of the elastic structural material after printing do not interfere with the bonding portion of the semiconductor chip, it is possible to prevent bonding failure upon appending the chip, worsening of the flatness of the wiring substrate and lowering of the reliability.</p>
    <p num="p-0809">(6) Since the planar S-shaped wiring can be obtained by forming the wiring of the wiring substrate such that the fixed portion with the substrate base material and top end portion connected to the external terminal of the semiconductor chip are displaced at least by more than the width of the wiring, a stable and suitable S-shaped lead can be formed because a sag due to the original planar S-shaped configuration can be obtained by a simple driving down movement of a typical wire bonder, so that a stable S-shaped configuration can be formed for the lead with no requirement of a soft-modified special wire bonder, and further, the contact time upon bonding can also be shortened since the bonding tool trace can also be simplified.</p>
    <p num="p-0810">(7) Since the beam wiring can be attained by forming the wiring of the wiring substrate as a cantilever structure which is fixed at one end to the substrate base material, it is possible to overcome such problems as occur in notched wirings wherein cutting is often impossible during bonding due to the variation of the size of the notches and, even if the wiring can be cut, it may be cut at a portion different from the desired notch, or it may be cut before the plating step for the wiring substrate because of the excessively narrowed portion, thereby failing to deposit plating.</p>
    <p num="p-0811">(8) Since the end of the opening of the surface protection film on the semiconductor chip is set to a size within a range wherein the wiring does not interfere with the surface protection film when the bonding tool is driven down, it is possible to overcome the problem that the surface protection film or the semiconductor chip suffers from damages (on the semiconductor chip) by the driving down pressure of the tool, and the ingredients of the surface protection film are prevented from being deposited on the bonding portion at the lower surface of the lead to cause contamination and to worsen the bondability.</p>
    <p num="p-0812">(9) Since the effective area of the wired portion can be enlarged by connecting the wiring on the notch terminal end of the wiring substrate to an opposing land portion of the wiring, longitudinally or laterally extending the wiring in the vacant regions of the wirings or connecting the adjacent wirings to each other, it is possible to increase the bonding strength between the wiring and the substrate base material and obtain a stable notch cutting performance.</p>
    <p num="p-0813">(10) Since a wide elastic material structure can be attained by forming the elastic structural material in a larger range over the entire circumference at least by more than the width of the protrusions on the outer circumference formed in the elastic structural material as compared with the outer size of the semiconductor chip, protrusions on the periphery of the elastic structural member are located outside of the semiconductor chip after the appending of the semiconductor chip, and it can be bonded substantially on the flat portion of the elastic structural material, whereby the warping of the wiring substrate is suppressed. Further, since a large coating area of adhesive can be provided, a not bonded portion caused by insufficient adhesive is less likely to occur, and the adhesive tends to extrude out uniformly around the periphery of the semiconductor chip, so that a package of excellent moisture proofness and reliability can be constituted with out applying an additional peripheral sealing.</p>
    <p num="p-0814">(11) In a case of forming the elastic structural material as divided portions which are spaced so as to be not bonded on the external terminals of the semiconductor chip, when each end of the spaces at which the divided elastic structural materials are opposed is formed as a grooved shape, the metal mask bridge portion can be restricted to narrow the groove of the elastic structural material in the groove-fillage technique of the elastic structural material, so that the groove-fillage of the elastic structural material can be improved.</p>
    <p num="p-0815">(12) If a plurality of grooves are formed at each of the ends of the elastic structural material, the strength of the groove-forming metal mask can be improved.</p>
    <p num="p-0816">(13) When a stopping dam for sealant flow is previously formed at the grooves at each of the ends of the spaces at which the divided structural materials are opposed, the groove-fillage in the sealing step can further be improved.</p>
    <p num="p-0817">(14) By pre-forming stud bumps on the external terminals of the semiconductor chip and connecting the external terminals of the semiconductor chip and the wirings of the wiring substrate by way of the stud bumps, problems in the bondability and the possibility of damage can be solved in the inner lead bonding technique, whereby the bondability is improved by the stud bumps and, further, the possibility of damage can be prevented.</p>
    <p num="p-0818">(15) By supplying the solder so as to previously surround the wirings of the wiring substrate and connecting the external terminals of the semiconductor chip and the external terminals of the wiring substrate by way of the solder, bondability can be improved and damage can be suppressed in the bonding technique.</p>
    <p num="p-0819">(16) By using the stud bumps, for example, made of solder or Au so as to surround the wirings of the wiring substrate, and by connecting the wirings of the wiring substrate and the external terminals of the semiconductor chip by way of the stud bumps, the bondability can be improved and the possibility of damage can be suppressed in the bonding technique.</p>
    <p num="p-0820">(17) By connecting the wirings of the wiring substrate and the external terminals of the semiconductor chip by using an Al, solder or Au wire, the problem, for example, of bondability or damage can be solved, and it is possible to attain connection by the concept of a typical wire bonding, not by the inner lead bonding, such as a TAB.</p>
    <p num="p-0821">(18) By forming the lateral size of the wiring of the wiring substrate such that the size is gradually narrowed from the end of the substrate base material of the wiring substrate to the top end of the wiring and the lateral size is made constant from a predetermined position, and setting the size and the shape of the wiring such that the bending stress ratio α is from 1.2 to 1.5, since a suitable S-shaped configuration can be formed by merely driving down the bonding tool vertically with no return of the bonding tool, a lead of a stably shaped configuration can be formed without requiring a special soft-modified wire bonder; and, further, the contact time upon bonding can also be shortened since the trace of the bonding tool can be simplified.</p>
    <p num="p-0822">(19) By using the electroconductive material as a core material for the wiring structure of the wiring substrate and applying only Au plating to the surface, since both the hardness and the brittleness of the lead are lowered as compared with a case of applying Ni-plating between the core material of the conductive material, such as Cu, and Au plating, cracks are less likely in the lead itself, and damage to the semiconductor chip at the counter bonding face can also be moderated.</p>
    <p num="p-0823">(20) By forming the wirings on the rear face of the substrate base material of the wiring substrate, forming the insulation film on the rear face of the wirings and disposing the elastic structure material on the rear face of the insulation film, since a rear face wiring insulation film structure can be obtained, direct contact of the elastic structural material with the wiring can be prevented and contact of the elastic structural material to the roughened surface of the substrate base material can also be prevented, so that bleeding of the low molecular weight ingredients of the elastic structure material can be suppressed and, further, the uneven wiring surface can be flattened by coating the insulation film making it possible to avoid disadvantages, such as the creation of voids upon forming the elastic structural material.</p>
    <p num="p-0824">(21) In the surface wiring structure, since the opening of the insulation film is formed by defining the coating range of the insulation film material, the fabrication accuracy for the hole diameter can further be improved as compared with a case of forming the opening by machining the substrate base material of the wiring substrate of the rear face wiring structure.</p>
    <p num="p-0825">(22) By setting the thickness of the insulation film by determining the coating condition for the insulation film material in the surface wiring structure, since the film can be coated stably at a further reduced thickness and the bump land disposed at a higher density with a small diameter can be formed as compared with the substrate base material, a smaller bump electrode can be joined more satisfactorily.</p>
    <p num="p-0826">(23) In the surface wiring structure, since the pitch for the arrangement of the bump electrodes can be reduced as compared with the rear face wiring structure, it is possible to constitute a semiconductor package having output terminals at higher density.</p>
    <p num="p-0827">(24) As the substrate body and substrate protruding parts of the thin film wiring substrate in the semiconductor device (CSP) are formed in a one-piece construction, the substrate protruding-parts are not formed independently and, therefore, do not have to be formed of costly materials. This lowers the cost of manufacturing the semiconductor device.</p>
    <p num="p-0828">(25) By providing the substrate protruding parts outside the openings in the thin film wiring substrate, when a sealing resin is applied via the openings, the sealing parts are formed as a bridge between the substrate protruding parts and the semiconductor chip. In this way, a stable seal can be obtained, sealing properties are improved, and consequently humidity resistance is improved.</p>
    <p num="p-0829">(26) When the bump electrodes are formed, even if the semiconductor device is subjected to reflow after it absorbs moisture, water vapor produced during reflow can be released to the outside via the elastic structure as the side faces in a predetermined direction of the elastic structure are exposed to the outside, and reflow tolerance is thereby improved.</p>
    <p num="p-0830">(27) By forming the elastic structure of a porous fluoride resin, the water vapor produced during reflow can be released to the outside and at the same time, penetration of moisture into the semiconductor device is prevented by the water repelling properties of the fluoride resin. As a result, deterioration of the electrical characteristics of the semiconductor device is reduced.</p>
    <p num="p-0831">(28) By incorporating a coloring agent in the elastic structure, transmittance of light in the elastic structure can be reduced without affecting the basic physical properties of the elastic structure. In this way, the circuit of the semiconductor chip can be shielded from light, ultraviolet light which would cause incorrect operation of the semiconductor chip is blocked, and operational stability of the electrical circuit of the semiconductor device is improved.</p>
    <p num="p-0832">(29) In the thin film wiring substrate, by making the connections between the wiring and bump lands wide, concentration of stress in the connections is prevented. Hence, even if the wiring deforms due to thermal contraction and expansion together with the tape base material during temperature cycles, rupture of leads is prevented in the connecting parts <b>4</b> <i>s </i>between the wiring and bump lands.</p>
    <p num="p-0833">(30) By forming the exposed parts in the elastic structure, even when the internal pressure of the elastic structure rises as during reflow for example, gas can be released to the outside from the exposed parts of the elastic structure. In this way, occurrence of the popcorn phenomenon which damages the sealing parts, etc., is prevented, and as a result the reliability of the semiconductor device is improved.</p>
