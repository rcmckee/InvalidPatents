    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention relates to a veneer lathe (peeling machine) for cutting (peeling) a veneer by making use of a cutting knife from a rotating log.</p>
    <p>As disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,219,060; U.S. Pat. No. 4,221,247; and Japanese Patent S59-45484, there is known a veneer lathe comprising a roller disposed substantially parallel with the linear cutting edge of the knife and provided with a large number of driving members which are arranged at intervals along the axial direction of the roller, each driving member being provided along the circumference thereof with a large number of piercing projections, and a guiding member for guiding a veneer that has been cut by the knife to run along the driving members.</p>
    <p>The aforementioned conventional veneer lathe is constructed as shown in FIG. 13 illustrating a partial enlarged view thereof and also in FIG. 14 illustrating a partial cross-sectional view as it is viewed in the direction of the arrow from the dot and dash line K—K in FIG. <b>13</b>. By the way, a veneer <b>111</b> to be explained hereinafter is omitted in FIG. <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIGS. 13 and 14, the veneer lathe comprises a cutting knife <b>103</b>, and a roller disposed substantially parallel with the linear cutting edge of the knife <b>103</b> and provided with a large number of piercing rolls <b>105</b> each functioning as a driving member which are arranged, through the interposition of a ring-shaped spacer <b>106</b>, at intervals along the axial direction of a rotary shaft <b>107</b> to be rotationally driven by a driving source (not shown), each piercing roller <b>105</b> being provided along the circumference thereof with a large number of piercing projections <b>105</b> <i>a</i>, and both knife <b>103</b> and roller being mounted on a knife carriage <b>101</b>. This roller is positioned so as to enable the piercing projections <b>105</b> <i>a </i>to pierce not only the outer peripheral wall portion of a log <b>109</b> in the vicinity of the cutting edge of the knife <b>103</b> but also a portion of the veneer <b>111</b> which is located immediately after the cutting thereof during the cutting operation of the log <b>109</b>.</p>
    <p>In the space between neighboring piercing rolls <b>105</b>, there is disposed a nose bar <b>113</b>, upper end portion of which is fixed to a portion of the knife carriage <b>101</b> and the lower end of which is designed to be press-contacted with an outer peripheral wall portion of the log <b>109</b> which is located immediately before being cut by the cutting knife <b>103</b>.</p>
    <p>In conformity with each nose bar <b>113</b>, a stripping member <b>115</b> having a stripping face <b>115</b> <i>a </i>for separating the veneer <b>111</b> from the piercing projections <b>105</b> <i>a </i>of piercing rolls <b>105</b> is attached to the knife carriage <b>101</b>. Furthermore, a concaved member <b>101</b> <i>a </i>and a guiding member, both of which are designed to guide the veneer <b>111</b> that has been cut by the cutting knife <b>103</b> to run along the piercing rolls <b>105</b>, are attached to the knife carriage <b>101</b>.</p>
    <p>In this case, as explained hereinafter, the veneer <b>111</b> is completely press-contacted with the stripping face <b>115</b> <i>a </i>of stripping member <b>115</b> so as to form slits <b>111</b> <i>a </i>on front surface of the veneer <b>111</b>, or the surface facing the stripping face <b>115</b> <i>a</i>, and furthermore, for the purpose of enhancing the effect of flattening the veneer, the distance between the tip end of the piercing projections <b>105</b> <i>a </i>and the concaved member <b>101</b> <i>a </i>or the guiding member <b>117</b> is usually made smaller than the thickness of the veneer <b>111</b>.</p>
    <p>By making use of the veneer lathe having the aforementioned structure, the piercing rolls <b>105</b> is allowed to rotate and at the same time, the log <b>109</b> is allowed to rotate by means of a spindle (not shown) while controlling a synchronizing mechanism (not shown) in such a manner that the peripheral speed of the log <b>109</b> becomes always identical with the peripheral speed of the piercing rolls <b>105</b>, under which conditions, the knife carriage <b>1</b> is moved at ratio of 3.5 mm per rotation of the log <b>109</b>.</p>
    <p>As a result, as shown in FIG. 13, the outer peripheral wall of the log <b>109</b> is permitted to be pierced by the piercing projections <b>105</b> <i>a </i>of the piercing rolls <b>105</b> as shown in FIG. 13, thereby giving a rotational force to the log <b>109</b> also from the piercing rolls <b>105</b> and allowing the log <b>109</b> to be cut by the knife <b>103</b> with the peripheral surface of the log <b>109</b> being pressed by the chip <b>113</b> <i>a </i>of nose bar <b>113</b>, thus obtaining the veneer <b>111</b> having a thickness of 3.5 mm for instance.</p>
    <p>In this case, the veneer <b>111</b> is pierced by the piercing projections <b>105</b> <i>a </i>and allowed to move as guided by the concaved member <b>101</b> <i>a </i>and the guiding member <b>117</b> to the stripping member <b>115</b>, which enables the veneer <b>111</b> to be separated from the piercing projections <b>105</b> <i>a </i>and bent to form slits <b>111</b> <i>a </i>in the veneer <b>111</b>. As a result, it is possible to obviate the generation of so-called curling phenomenon or a phenomenon of causing the veneer to be rounded into a cylindrical configuration, thus making it possible to obtain a flat veneer, which makes it easy to work the veneer in the following steps.</p>
    <p>As explained above, the provision of these concaved member <b>101</b> <i>a</i>, guiding member <b>117</b> and stripping member <b>115</b> is certainly important in the aforementioned veneer lathe. However, due to the piercing by the piercing projections <b>105</b> <i>a </i>of piercing rolls <b>105</b>, a large number of scars are caused to be formed on the front surface of the veneer <b>111</b>.</p>
    <p>As in a case where a face sheet to be employed as a front sheet of plywood for example is to be produced in the aforementioned veneer lathe, it is sometimes desired to obtain a veneer <b>111</b> having a flat front surface which is free from any pierced scar due to the piercing projections <b>105</b> <i>a </i>of piercing rolls <b>105</b>. According to the conventional veneer lathe however, even if the rotational axis <b>107</b> of the piercing rolls <b>105</b> is moved away from the log <b>109</b> from the state shown in FIG. 13, i.e. moved in the rightward direction in FIG. 13, thus separating the piercing projections <b>105</b> <i>a </i>from the log <b>109</b> as shown in FIG. 15, it is impossible, due to fact that the concaved member <b>101</b> <i>a </i>constituting a guide member and the guiding member <b>117</b> are located along the transferring direction of veneer, to avoid the pierced scar by the piercing rolls <b>105</b> from being formed in the front surface of the veneer <b>111</b>.</p>
    <p>Namely, in the state shown in FIG. 15, the log <b>109</b> can be prevented from being pierced by the piercing projections <b>105</b> <i>a</i>. However, since the distance between the tip end of the piercing projections <b>105</b> <i>a </i>of the piercing rolls <b>105</b> and the concaved member <b>101</b> <i>a </i>or the guiding member <b>117</b> cannot be changed substantially, the veneer <b>111</b> is caused to be pierced by the piercing projections <b>105</b> <i>a </i>as it passes through the concaved member <b>101</b> <i>a </i>or the guiding member <b>117</b>, thereby leaving pierced scars on the surface of the veneer <b>111</b>.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The object of the present invention is to provide a veneer lathe which is capable of producing a veneer which is free from the aforementioned pierced scars in spite of facts that the veneer lathe is provided with a driving member such as the aforementioned piercing rolls <b>105</b> and with a guiding member such as the concaved member <b>101</b> <i>a </i>or the guiding member <b>117</b>.</p>
    <p>Namely, the veneer lathe according to the present invention comprises; a knife for cutting a log; a roller disposed substantially parallel with the linear cutting edge of the knife and provided with a large number of driving members which are arranged at intervals along the axial direction of the roller, each driving member being provided along the circumference thereof with a large number of piercing projections; a driving mechanism attached to the roller; a pressure member disposed at a location which enables the pressure member to press-contact with the outer peripheral wall of the log through a plurality of spaces formed between said driving members neighboring to each other of the roller; a guiding member for guiding a veneer which is cut by means of said knife to move along said driving members; a knife carriage for mounting thereon said knife, said roller, said driving mechanism, said pressure member and said guiding member; a spindle rotatably supporting a log; and a driving for rotating said spindle; wherein said roller is enabled to take a first position wherein said piercing projections of the driving member is enabled to pierce not only the outer peripheral wall portion of a log in the vicinity of said cutting edge of said knife but also a portion of the veneer which is cut by said cutting knife and is not yet passed through said guiding member, as well as to take a second position wherein said piercing projections of the driving member is not allowed to contact with not only the outer peripheral wall portion of the log but also said portion of the veneer or wherein the tip ends of said piercing projections are contacted only with the outer peripheral wall portion of the log in the vicinity of said cutting edge, said rollers being designed to be fixed at said first position or at said second position.</p>
    <p>According to the veneer lathe of the present invention, the roller is kept at the first position on the occasion of ordinary cutting operation. However, when it is desired to obtain a veneer having a flat smooth surface as in the case where a face sheet to be employed as a front sheet of plywood is desired to obtain, the roller is moved from the first position to the second position. As a result, it becomes possible to avoid the veneer to be cut from being pierced by the piercing projections, thus obtaining a veneer free from any piercing scar.</p>
    <p>Although there is not any particular limitation regarding the means for moving the roller from the first position to the second position and vice versa, and for fixing the roller at these positions, the means should preferably be constituted by a first reciprocating member mounted on the knife carriage for enabling the roller to be reciprocatively moved to take a position permitting the piercing projections to pierce the outer periphery of log in the vicinity of the cutting edge of the knife or to take a position where the piercing projections are kept away from the outer periphery of log, and by a second reciprocating member mounted on the knife carriage for enabling the roller to be reciprocatively moved to take a position where a distance between the tip end of the piercing projections and the guiding member located in the vicinity of the cutting edge of the knife and in the running direction of the log is smaller than the thickness of the veneer being cut, and to take a position where said distance is larger than the thickness of the veneer being cut.</p>
    <p>As for the first reciprocating member, it may be constituted by a reciprocating member which enables the roller to be reciprocatively moved to take a position permitting the piercing projections to pierce the outer periphery of log in the vicinity of the cutting edge of the knife or to take a position where the tip ends of piercing projections are allowed to contact with the outer periphery of log in the vicinity of the cutting edge.</p>
    <p>In this veneer lathe, the first reciprocating member may be constituted by an air cylinder. Further, the second reciprocating member may be constituted by an eccentric cam, wherein the roller is rotatably secured to a lower end portion of an arm which is enabled to be moved to take, through the rotation of this eccentric cam, a position which is close to the guiding member or a position which is away from the guiding member.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, the first reciprocating member may be constituted by a reciprocating member which enables the roller to be reciprocatively moved to take a position permitting the piercing projections to pierce the outer periphery of log in the vicinity of the cutting edge of the knife, to take a position where the tip ends of piercing projections are allowed to contact with the outer periphery of log in the vicinity of the cutting edge, or to take a position where the piercing projections are kept away from the outer periphery of log.</p>
    <p>In this veneer lathe, the first reciprocating member may be constituted by an air cylinder provided with an intermediate stopping mechanism.</p>

    <p>FIG. 1 shows a side view schematically illustrating the knife carriage <b>1</b> and spindle <b>2</b> of a veneer lathe; FIG. 2 shows a partial front view of the right side of the knife carriage <b>1</b> which is viewed from the direction of arrows of the dot and dash line A—A of FIG. 1 wherein a log <b>3</b> of FIG. 1 is omitted for the convenience of explanation; FIG. 3 shows a partial cross-sectional view as it is viewed from the direction of arrows of the dot and dash line B—B of FIG. 2; FIG. 4 shows a partial cross-sectional view as it is viewed from the direction of arrows of the dot and dash line C—C of FIG. 2; FIG. 5 shows a partial cross-sectional view as it is viewed from the direction of arrows of the dot and dash line D—D of FIG. 2; and FIG. 6 shows a partial cross-sectional view as it is viewed from the direction of arrows of the dot and dash line E—E of FIG. <b>2</b>.</p>
    <p>In the same manner as in the case of the conventional veneer lathe, a veneer lathe <b>1</b> is designed to be moved at a speed which enables to obtain a predetermined thickness of veneer that can be produced through the cutting by a knife <b>5</b> as explained hereinafter. For this purpose, a male screw P to be rotated by means of a motor (not shown) is engaged with a female screw (not shown) attached to the knife carriage <b>1</b>, thereby enabling the veneer lathe <b>1</b> to horizontally move toward a log <b>3</b> at a distance equal to the thickness of veneer per revolution of the log <b>3</b> which is supported by the spindle <b>2</b> to be rotated in the direction of the arrow by means of a motor <b>2</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p>This veneer lathe <b>1</b> is provided with various constituent components as explained below.</p>
    <p>Namely, a pillow bearing <b>7</b> shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 is fixedly attached to the upper mount <b>10</b> of a nose bar table <b>1</b> <i>a</i>, and a first rotational axis <b>9</b> is rotatably sustained by the pillow bearing <b>7</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 6, a sprocket <b>11</b> is fixed to the first rotational axis <b>9</b> by means of a key <b>13</b> and a key seat <b>13</b> <i>a</i>, both of which are known in structure. In this case, the rotation of a servo-motor <b>14</b> provided with a tacho-generator (not shown) for detecting the quantity of rotation is transmitted to the sprocket <b>11</b>, thereby permitting the first rotational axis <b>9</b> to rotate up to any desired angle within the range of from 0 to 180 degrees.</p>
    <p>Further, the first rotational axis <b>9</b> is coaxially provided at one end thereof with a small diametral portion <b>9</b> <i>a</i>, on which a cylindrical second rotational axis <b>17</b> is fixed by means of a key and a key seat (both not shown) under the condition as explained below. Namely, the outer diameter of the second rotational axis <b>17</b> is smaller than that of the first rotational axis <b>9</b> by 1 mm for instance, and the second rotational axis <b>17</b> is eccentrically attached to the small diametral portion <b>9</b> <i>a</i>, so that when the through-hole thereof having an inner diameter which is equal to the outer diameter of the small diametral portion <b>9</b> <i>a </i>is secured to the small diametral portion <b>9</b> <i>a</i>, the outer periphery of the second rotational axis <b>17</b> is contacted at only one point with the outer periphery of the first rotational axis <b>9</b>. As a result, when the first rotational axis <b>9</b> is rotated, the level of the uppermost portion of the outer periphery of the second rotational axis <b>17</b> can be altered in the elevational direction of FIGS. 2 and 3 by 2 mm at maximum for instance.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 14, an upper end portion of arm <b>19</b> is sustained through a first bearing <b>21</b> to the second rotational axis <b>17</b>, so that the arm <b>19</b> is permitted to rotate in relative to the second rotational axis <b>17</b>.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, an lower end portion of arm <b>19</b> is rotatably sustained through a second bearing <b>23</b> to the third rotational axis <b>25</b>.</p>
    <p>A fourth rotational axis <b>26</b> having a larger outer diameter than the outer diameter of the third rotational axis <b>25</b> is formed coaxially and integral with the third rotational axis <b>25</b>, and as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, a large number of disc-like piercing rolls <b>27</b> each having along the outer peripheral wall thereof a large number of piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>and representing one example of a driving member are mounted at predetermined intervals along the longitudinal direction and coaxially on the fourth rotational axis <b>26</b> by means of a key and a key seat (both not shown), thus constructing one embodiment of the roller.</p>
    <p>Since the roller is constructed in this manner, when the first rotational axis <b>9</b> is rotated by means of the servo-motor <b>14</b> so as to render the level of uppermost portion of the outer periphery of the second rotational axis <b>17</b> to take the lowest state, i.e. a state shown in FIG. 3, the piercing rolls <b>27</b> are kept on standby at the lowest level. On the other hand, when the first rotational axis <b>9</b> is rotated 180 degrees further from the state shown in FIG. 3 by means of the servo-motor <b>14</b> so as to render the level of uppermost portion of the outer periphery of the second rotational axis <b>17</b> to take the highest state, the piercing rolls <b>27</b> are kept on standby at the highest level.</p>
    <p>Between each pair of the piercing rolls <b>27</b> neighboring to each other in the axial direction of the fourth rotational axis <b>26</b>, there is interposed, as shown in FIG. 3, a nose bar <b>29</b> representing one example of the pressure member with the upper end portion of the nose bar <b>29</b> being fixed to the nose bar table <b>1</b> <i>a</i>. By the way, as explained hereinafter, the nose bar <b>29</b> is detachably provided at the lower end thereof with a chip <b>29</b> <i>a </i>which is to be press-contacted with the outer peripheral wall of the log <b>3</b> at a position immediately before the knife <b>3</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 7 illustrating an enlarged view of the cutting edge portion of the knife <b>5</b> shown in FIG. <b>3</b> and also shown in FIG. 8 illustrating a partial cross-sectional view of the cutting edge portion as it is viewed from the direction of arrows of the dot and dash line F—F of FIG. 7, a stripping member <b>8</b> having a stripping face <b>8</b> <i>a </i>which is disposed to intersect with an imaginary circle interconnecting the tip ends of the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>is attached at each interspace between neighboring piercing rolls <b>27</b> of the nose bar table <b>1</b> <i>a</i>. By the way, the nose bar <b>29</b> is omitted in FIG. 7 for the convenience of explanation.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 5, a sprocket <b>33</b> is secured to one end portion of the third rotational shaft <b>25</b>, and a chain <b>37</b> for transmitting the motive power of the motor <b>35</b> mounted on the nose bar table <b>1</b> <i>a </i>to the sprocket <b>33</b> is disposed therebetween while being engaged with the sprocket <b>36</b> which is secured to the rotational axis of the motor <b>35</b>, with a driven sprocket <b>39</b> which is mounted, through each bearing member, on the small diametral portion <b>9</b> <i>a </i>and the mount <b>10</b>, and with a driven sprocket <b>41</b>. The sprocket <b>36</b> of the motor <b>35</b> is ordinary rotated in the direction indicated by the arrow, thereby causing the sprocket <b>33</b> to rotate in the direction indicated by the arrow. As a result, the piercing rolls <b>27</b> are caused to rotate ordinary in the direction indicated by the arrow in FIG. <b>7</b>.</p>
    <p>In order to enable the piercing rolls <b>27</b> to reciprocatively move in the direction to contact with or separated away from a portion of the log <b>3</b> disposed in the vicinity of the cutting edge of the knife <b>5</b>, the roller is constructed as follows.</p>
    <p>Namely, as shown in FIG. 4, a coupling member <b>19</b> <i>a </i>is attached to one side of the arm <b>19</b> which is opposite to the side facing the knife <b>5</b>. Further, an air cylinder <b>43</b> is rotatably mounted through the terminal end portion thereof on a portion of the nose bar table <b>1</b> <i>a</i>, and a flange <b>43</b> <i>b </i>having a larger diameter than that of the piston rod <b>43</b> <i>a </i>is attached to the distal end portion of the piston rod <b>43</b> <i>a </i>which is made retractable, wherein the coupling member <b>19</b> <i>a </i>and the flange <b>43</b> <i>b </i>are rotatably interconnected with each other by means of a pin <b>44</b>.</p>
    <p>By the way, the air cylinder <b>43</b> is attached to the nose bar table <b>1</b> <i>a </i>in such a manner that when the piston rod <b>43</b> <i>a </i>is advanced fully from the main body of the air cylinder <b>43</b>, the tip ends of the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>of the piercing rolls <b>27</b> mounted on the fourth rotational shaft <b>26</b>, which are located close to the log <b>3</b>, are enabled to take a first position which coincides with an imaginary cut line which is assumed to be cut by the knife <b>5</b>, i.e. the two dots and dash line X—X which is extended perpendicularly upward from the cutting edge of the knife <b>5</b> as shown in FIG. <b>7</b>.</p>
    <p>Additionally, a cylindrical stopper <b>46</b> into which the piston rod <b>43</b> <i>a </i>is enabled to be inserted is provided, so that when the piston rod <b>43</b> <i>a </i>is moved back to the main body of the air cylinder <b>43</b>, the flange <b>43</b> <i>b </i>is caused to contact with the stopper <b>46</b>, whereby the positioning of the piston rod <b>43</b> <i>a </i>is effected by this stopper <b>46</b>. As a result, the piercing rolls <b>27</b> are enabled to be stopped and kept on standby at the second position which is shifted 10 mm rightward from the first position as shown in FIG. <b>4</b>.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, as shown in FIG. 3, the knife <b>5</b> for cutting the log <b>3</b> which is rotatably supported by the spindle <b>2</b> (the rotation of the log <b>3</b> is effected by means of the motor <b>2</b> <i>a </i>shown in FIG. 1) is mounted on a knife holder table <b>1</b> <i>b </i>(which constitutes a lower portion of the knife carriage <b>1</b>) in such a manner that as in the case of the conventional veneer lathe, the knife <b>5</b> is sustained by a <b>5</b> <i>a</i>, etc. with the cutting edge thereof being directed upward.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 7, a concave portion <b>4</b> is formed on the surface of the knife holder table <b>1</b> <i>b </i>facing the piercing rolls <b>27</b>, and a guide member <b>6</b> is inserted into and fixed to a cut-out portion <b>6</b> <i>a </i>which is formed on a surface portion of the knife holder table <b>1</b> <i>b </i>facing the piercing rolls <b>27</b>. Specifically, the guide member <b>6</b> is disposed in such a manner that a portion thereof is protruded upward from the cut-out portion <b>6</b> <i>a </i>and is positioned to face the stripping member <b>8</b>. Namely, these concave portion <b>4</b> and guide member <b>6</b> constitute together with the backing plate <b>5</b> <i>a </i>one example of guiding member.</p>
    <p>By the way, when the piercing rolls <b>27</b> are placed at the lowest level in the elevational direction thereof and at the same time, at the first position in the horizontal direction thereof, each surface of the backing plate <b>5</b> <i>a</i>, concave portion <b>4</b> and the guiding member <b>6</b>, which faces the piercing rolls <b>27</b>, is designed to constitute a portion of concentric circle of the piercing rolls <b>27</b> with a distance between said each surface and the tip ends of the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>being set to about 2 mm.</p>
    <p>Further, as shown in FIG. 2, when the connecting member <b>1</b> <i>d </i>attached to the nose bar table <b>1</b> <i>a </i>and the connecting member <b>1</b> <i>c </i>attached to the knife holding table <b>1</b> <i>b </i>are connected with each other through a connecting body <b>1</b> <i>e</i>, these tables <b>1</b> <i>a </i>and <b>1</b> <i>b </i>can be integrated, thus forming a knife carriage <b>1</b>.</p>
    <p>By the way, although the right side portion of the roller is shown in FIG. 2 illustrating the front view of the knife carriage <b>1</b>, the left side portion of the roller is symmetrical to the right side portion of the roller is shown in FIG. 2, so that components of the same kinds as shown in FIG. 2 are disposed therein.</p>
    <p>When, for instance, the piercing rolls <b>27</b> are placed at the highest level in the elevational direction thereof and at the same time, at the second position in the horizontal direction thereof in the structure of roller shown in FIG. 7, the servo-motor <b>14</b> is actuated at first so as to rotate the first rotational shaft <b>9</b>, thereby rendering the piercing rolls <b>27</b> to take and keep a state as shown in FIG. 3 or a state where the piercing rolls <b>27</b> are positioned at the lowest level, and at the same time, in order to keep the piercing rolls <b>27</b> in a state of standby at the first position, the piston rod <b>43</b> <i>a </i>of the air cylinder <b>43</b> is advanced toward the log <b>3</b> to thereby perform the initialization.</p>
    <p>As a result, the piercing rolls <b>27</b> are kept on standby at the position shown in FIG. 7, and hence, the distance between the tip ends of the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>of the piercing rolls <b>27</b> and the backing plate <b>5</b> <i>a</i>, concave portion <b>4</b> and the guiding member <b>6</b>, which faces the piercing rolls <b>27</b>, can be set to about 2 mm.</p>
    <p>Under these conditions, the piercing rolls <b>27</b> are rotated in the direction indicated by the arrow by means of motor <b>35</b>, and at the same time, the knife carriage <b>1</b> is shifted toward the log <b>3</b> at a rate of 3.5 mm per revolution of the log <b>3</b>, the rotation of the log <b>3</b> being effected by means of the spindle <b>2</b> while controlling a synchronization mechanism (not shown) so as to make the peripheral speed of the log <b>3</b> coincide all the time with the peripheral speed of the piercing rolls <b>27</b>.</p>
    <p>As a result, in the same manner as in the case of the conventional apparatus of FIG. 13, the outer peripheral wall of the log <b>3</b> as indicated by a two dots and dash line is permitted to be pierced by the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>of the piercing rolls <b>27</b> as shown in FIG. 7, thereby giving a rotational force to the log <b>3</b> also from the piercing rolls <b>105</b> and allowing the log <b>3</b> to be cut by the knife <b>5</b> with the peripheral surface of the log <b>3</b> being pressed by the chip <b>29</b> <i>a </i>of nose bar <b>29</b>, thus obtaining the veneer T having a thickness of 3.5 mm for instance.</p>
    <p>Since the distance between the tip ends of the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>of the piercing rolls <b>27</b> and the surfaces of backing plate <b>5</b> <i>a</i>, concave portion <b>4</b> and guiding member <b>6</b> is set as mentioned above, the veneer T is kept pierced by the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>due to its own weight, etc. and allowed to pass through the portions of backing plate <b>5</b> <i>a</i>, concave portion <b>4</b> and guiding member <b>6</b> until the veneer T is contacted with the stripping member <b>8</b>, at which point the veneer T is removed from the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>and transferred to the next step.</p>
    <p>The veneer T thus obtained is accompanied with a large number of pierced scars due to the piercing by the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>of the piercing rolls <b>27</b>.</p>
    <p>Next, the production of a veneer which is desirably free from any external scars such as pierced scars as in the case of the veneer to be employed as a front sheet for constituting an outermost layer of laminate body such as plywood will be explained.</p>
    <p>In this case, in relative to the positions of the members shown in FIG. 7, the motor <b>14</b> is rotated at first, i.e. before starting the cutting operation, thereby causing the first rotational shaft <b>9</b> to turn 180 degrees. As a result, the position of the second rotational shaft <b>17</b> relative to the first rotational shaft <b>9</b> is changed from the state shown in FIG. 3 to the state shown in FIG. <b>9</b>. Namely, the arm <b>19</b> supported by the second rotational shaft <b>17</b> is caused to be raised as a whole by a height of 2 mm and at the same time, the piercing rolls <b>27</b> fixed to the fourth rotational shaft <b>26</b> is also caused to be raised by a height of 2 mm, thus keeping them in a state of standby at the highest position thereof.</p>
    <p>Then, the piston rod <b>43</b> <i>a </i>of the air cylinder <b>43</b> is moved backward so as to enable the coupling member <b>43</b> <i>b </i>to press-contact with the stopper <b>46</b>, thereby shifting the piercing rolls <b>27</b> from the first position to the second position where the piercing rolls <b>27</b> are kept on standby.</p>
    <p>As a result, the relationship between the piercing rolls <b>27</b> and other members would become as shown in FIG. 10 showing an enlarged view of FIG. <b>7</b>. Namely, the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>are kept away from the log <b>3</b> and the distance between the tip ends of the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>of the piercing rolls <b>27</b> and the surfaces of concave portion <b>4</b> and guiding member <b>6</b> becomes about 2 mm.</p>
    <p>By the way, the nose bar <b>29</b> and the chip <b>29</b> <i>a </i>are shown in FIG. <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>Under this condition, in the same manner as described above, the piercing rolls <b>27</b> are rotated in the direction indicated by the arrow, and at the same time, the knife carriage <b>1</b> is shifted toward the log <b>3</b> at a rate of 1 mm per revolution of the log <b>3</b>, the rotation of the log <b>3</b> being effected by means of the spindle <b>2</b> while controlling the spindle <b>2</b> so as to make the peripheral speed of the log <b>3</b> coincide all the time with the peripheral speed of the piercing rolls <b>27</b>.</p>
    <p>As a result, as shown in FIG. 10, the outer peripheral wall of the log <b>3</b> is prevented from being pierced by the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>of the piercing rolls <b>27</b>, thereby receiving the rotational force from only the spindle <b>2</b> and allowing the log <b>3</b> to be cut by the knife <b>5</b> with the peripheral surface of the log <b>3</b> being pressed by the chip <b>29</b> <i>a </i>of nose bar <b>29</b>, thus obtaining the veneer T<b>1</b> having a thickness of 1 mm for instance.</p>
    <p>The veneer T<b>1</b> is then allowed to pass through spaces between the tip ends of the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>of the piercing rolls <b>27</b> and the surfaces of concave portion <b>4</b> and guiding member <b>6</b>, and after being contacted with the stripping member <b>8</b>, the veneer T<b>1</b> is transferred to the next step. Since the distance between the tip ends of the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>of the piercing rolls <b>27</b> and the surfaces of backing plate <b>5</b> <i>a</i>, concave portion <b>4</b> and guiding member <b>6</b> is set to about 2 mm during the transfer of this veneer T<b>1</b>, the veneer T<b>1</b> is prevented from being pierced by the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>during the passage thereof through these spaces, thus making it possible to obtain the veneer T<b>1</b> free from any pierced scars.</p>
    <p>In the case of producing the veneer T<b>1</b> which is free from any pierced scars, the veneer T<b>1</b> can be produced without necessitating the rotation of the piercing rolls <b>27</b>. However, the rotation of the piercing rolls <b>27</b> during the production of the veneer T<b>1</b> would be advantageous due to the following effects.</p>
    <p>Generally, the generation of so-called curling phenomenon or a phenomenon of causing the veneer to be rounded into a cylindrical configuration tends to occur in the production of a veneer through the cutting of a log. However, even if this curling phenomenon to round up the lower end portion located downstream side in the transferring direction of the veneer T<b>1</b> tends to be generated during the transfer thereof until it is contacted with the stripping member <b>8</b>, the lower end portion of the veneer T<b>1</b> is permitted to be contacted with the tip ends of the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>of the piercing rolls <b>27</b> which are being rotated, whereby the lower end portion of the veneer T<b>1</b> is enabled to be guided toward the stripping member <b>8</b>. As a result, the veneer T<b>1</b> is prevented from being clogged at an interface between the piercing rolls <b>27</b> and the concave portion <b>4</b> or guiding member <b>6</b>.</p>
    <p>Moreover, once the interface between the log <b>3</b> and the nose bar <b>29</b> is clogged with wood chips (waste), a wedging effect may be generated at the interface, so that a large pushing force is imposed on the log <b>3</b>, thus giving rise to the generation of a continuous groove-like flaw on the surface of the veneer thus obtained. Even in this case, as long as the piercing rolls <b>27</b> is kept rotated, the wood chips existing at the interface can be pierced by the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>of the piercing rolls <b>27</b> and allowed to pass through a space between the chip <b>29</b> <i>a </i>and the log <b>3</b> due to the rotational force of the piercing rolls <b>27</b> and to contact with the stripping member <b>8</b>. As a result, the wood chips can be removed from the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a</i>. Furthermore, even if a recessed portion is partially generated on the surface of veneer due to the wood chips during the transfer of the veneer, the recessed portion would not become a continuous flaw.</p>
    <p>The production of a veneer which is desirably free from any external scars such as pierced scars as in the case of the veneer to be employed as a front sheet for constituting an outermost layer of laminate body such as plywood may be performed in the following manner.</p>
    <p>In this case also, in relative to the positions of the members shown in FIG. 7, the motor <b>14</b> is rotated at first, i.e. before starting the cutting operation, thereby causing the first rotational shaft <b>9</b> to turn 180 degrees so as to keep the piercing rolls <b>27</b> in a state of standby at the highest position thereof. Additionally, the position where the piercing rolls <b>27</b> is shifted away from the log and kept on standby through the actuation of the air cylinder <b>43</b> is selected to be such as described below.</p>
    <p>Namely, the piercing rolls <b>27</b> is kept in a state of standby at the position where the distance between the tip end of the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>of piercing rolls <b>27</b> which are disposed close to the log <b>3</b> and the aforementioned imaginary line X—X would become identical with the thickness of the veneer being cut, e.g. about 1 mm as shown in FIG. 11 at the moment when the flange <b>43</b> <i>b </i>is contacted with the stopper <b>46</b> as the piston rod <b>43</b> <i>a </i>is moved backward through the actuation of the air cylinder <b>43</b> from the position of the piercing rolls <b>27</b> shown in FIG. <b>7</b>.</p>
    <p>For this purpose, the length of the stopper <b>46</b> installed as shown in FIG. 4 is extended along the moving direction of the piston rod <b>43</b> <i>a</i>. For example, the interval between the flange <b>43</b> <i>b </i>and the stopper <b>46</b> in FIG. 4 is set to about 1 mm.</p>
    <p>As described above, the piercing rolls <b>27</b> are kept in a state of standby at the uppermost position thereof through the rotation of the motor <b>14</b> and then, the distance between the tip end of the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>and the imaginary line X—X is set to about 1 mm, after which the piercing rolls <b>27</b> are rotated in the direction indicated by the arrow as shown in FIG. 11, and at the same time, the knife carriage <b>1</b> is shifted toward the log <b>3</b> at a rate of 1 mm per revolution of the log <b>3</b>, the rotation of the log <b>3</b> being effected by means of the spindle <b>2</b> while controlling the spindle <b>2</b> so as to make the peripheral speed of the log <b>3</b> coincide all the time with the peripheral speed of the piercing rolls <b>27</b>.</p>
    <p>As a result, as shown in FIG. 11, the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>of the piercing rolls <b>27</b> is allowed to rotate at the same speed as that of the log <b>3</b> while the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>are contacted with the outer peripheral wall of the log <b>3</b> being rotated, whereby the force required for the cutting of the log <b>3</b> is substantially given by the spindle <b>2</b>, and the log <b>3</b> is cut by the knife <b>5</b> with the peripheral surface thereof being always pressed by the chip <b>29</b> <i>a </i>of nose bar <b>29</b>, thus obtaining the veneer T<b>1</b> having a thickness of 1 mm for instance.</p>
    <p>The surface of veneer T<b>1</b> thus obtained is substantially free from any pierced flaws, and even if a space between the log <b>3</b> and the nose bar <b>29</b> is clogged with wood chips as in the aforementioned example, the wood chips would be deeply pierced by the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a</i>, thereby making it possible to reliably remove the wood chips after allowing the wood chips to pass through a space between the log <b>3</b> and the chip <b>3</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p>Where it is desired to cut the log <b>3</b> while allowing the log <b>3</b> to be pierced by the piercing rolls <b>27</b> in the aforementioned example, the outer peripheral wall of the log <b>3</b> is enabled to be press-contacted with the piercing rolls <b>27</b> through the adjustment of the force of the air cylinder <b>43</b>, so that the pressure of the piercing rolls <b>27</b> to be imposed on the log <b>3</b> can be suitably adjusted depending on the magnitude of the hardness of the log <b>3</b>.</p>
    <p>For example, if a hard log is to be treated, the cutting resistance to be imposed on the knife <b>5</b> would be increased. In such a case, the pressure of the air cylinder <b>43</b> is increased so as to allow the log to be fully pierced by the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>of the piercing rolls <b>27</b>, thus making it possible to increase the driving force to be given to the log <b>3</b> from the piercing rolls <b>27</b> and hence to perform an excellent cutting. On the other hand, if a relatively soft log is to be treated, the cutting resistance to be imposed on the knife <b>5</b> would be small, so that the pressure of the air cylinder <b>43</b> is minimized so as to allow the log to be slightly pierced by the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>of the piercing rolls <b>27</b> in the cutting operation of the log <b>3</b>.</p>
    <p>The aforementioned examples can be modified as follows.</p>
    <p>1. The operation of shifting the piercing rolls <b>27</b> from the position where the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>are pierced into the surface of log <b>3</b> as shown in FIG. 7 to the position where the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>are kept away from or contacted with the log <b>3</b> as shown in FIG. 10 or <b>11</b>; or on the contrary, the operation of shifting the piercing rolls <b>27</b> from the position where the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>are kept away from or contacted with the log <b>3</b> to the position where the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>are pierced into the surface of log <b>3</b> may be performed without interrupting the cutting operation of the log <b>3</b>. Namely, without necessitating the interruption of the rotation of the log <b>3</b>, i.e. the interruption of the revolution of the log <b>3</b>, the magnitude of shifting the knife carriage <b>1</b> per revolution of the log <b>3</b> can be changed or the position of the piercing rolls <b>27</b> can be changed through the actuation of servo-motor <b>14</b> and air cylinder <b>43</b>.</p>
    <p>2. The depth of the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>of the piercing rolls <b>27</b> in the surface of the log <b>3</b> as shown in FIG. 7, as well as the distance to keep the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>away from the log <b>3</b> as shown in FIG. 10 can be suitably selected.</p>
    <p>3. In addition to the position where the piston rod <b>43</b> <i>a </i>is fully advanced from the main body of the cylinder <b>43</b> and to the position where the piston rod <b>43</b> <i>a </i>is retracted back into the main body of the cylinder <b>43</b>, the air cylinder <b>43</b> may be enabled to stop at a desired intermediate position between the aforementioned positions through the application of a braking action to the piston rod <b>43</b> <i>a</i>, thus modifying the air cylinder <b>43</b> into an air cylinder provided with an intermediate stopping mechanism, which can be employed as follows.</p>
    <p>Namely, the piercing rolls <b>27</b> are enabled to take and keep a position where the piston rod <b>43</b> <i>a </i>of the air cylinder is fully advanced thereby enabling the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>to pierce into the log <b>3</b> as shown in FIG. 7; a position where the piston rod <b>43</b> <i>a </i>is slightly retracted through the action of brake, thereby enabling the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>to contact with the log <b>3</b> as shown in FIG. 11; or a position where the piston rod <b>43</b> <i>a </i>is retracted through the release of brake, thereby enabling the flange <b>43</b> <i>b </i>to be contacted with the cylindrical stopper <b>46</b> so as to keep the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>away from the log <b>3</b> as shown in FIG. <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>4. As for the first reciprocating member for enabling the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>of piercing rolls <b>27</b> to take a position permitting them to pierce the outer periphery of log <b>3</b> or to take a position where the piercing projections are contacted with or kept away from the outer periphery of log <b>3</b>, and as for the second reciprocating member for enabling the piercing rolls <b>27</b> to move so as to change the distance between the tip end of the piercing projections <b>27</b> <i>a </i>and the guiding member such as the concave portion or the guiding portion, these reciprocating members may be formed by making use of a cam.</p>
    <p>5. In the aforementioned examples, the guiding member for guiding a veneer that has been cut by means of a knife so as to move it along the driving members is constituted as one example by three components comprising the backing plate <b>5</b> <i>a</i>, the concave portion <b>4</b> and the guiding member <b>6</b>. However, the guiding member may be constituted by a single component or a suitable number of components.</p>
    <p>6. The cutting operation of the log <b>3</b> while allowing the outer peripheral wall of log <b>3</b> to be pierced by the piercing projections of the piercing rolls <b>27</b> as shown in FIG. 7 may be performed in the following manner.</p>
    <p>Namely, as shown in FIG. 12, a pair of driven rollers <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> disposed parallel and respectively having a rotational center which is located (spaced apart from each other by a predetermined distance) along the vertical direction orthogonally intersecting a horizontal imaginary line passing through the rotational center of the spindle <b>2</b> are disposed on the side of the log <b>3</b> which is opposite to where the knife carriage <b>1</b> is positioned. More specifically, these driven rollers <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> are contacted with the outer peripheral wall of the log and designed to be horizontally moved toward the spindle <b>2</b> at the same shifting rate as that of the knife carriage <b>1</b> during the cutting operation of the log <b>3</b>. In this construction, even if the spindle <b>2</b> is moved away from the log <b>3</b> after these rollers <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> are contacted with the outer peripheral wall of the log, the log <b>3</b> can be kept sustained by these rollers <b>31</b> and <b>33</b>, and at the same time, the driving power required for the cutting can be supplied from only the piercing rolls <b>27</b>, so that the log <b>3</b> can be cut even after the diameter of the log <b>3</b> has become smaller than that of the spindle <b>2</b>.</p>
    <p>In this case, with a view to supplement the driving force required for the cutting of the log <b>3</b>, at least one of these rollers <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> may be constituted by a driving roller.</p>
    <p>7. The stripping member <b>8</b> may be also provided with a shifting member for allowing the stripping member <b>8</b> to reciprocatively move in the direction orthogonally intersecting the running direction of the log <b>3</b> in the vicinity of the cutting edge of the knife <b>5</b>.</p>
    <p>According to the veneer lathe of the present invention which is provided, on the knife carriage, with driving members each having piercing projections such as piercing rolls, and with a guiding member such as a concave portion or a guiding portion for enabling a veneer to move along the driving members, since at least a portion of the driving force required for the cutting of the log can be supplied through the piercing of the piercing projections into the surface of the log, a veneer which is free or substantially free from piercing flaws can be produced.</p>
