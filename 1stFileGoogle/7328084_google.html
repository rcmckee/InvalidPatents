Each carrier which is to be employed within the system includes an identification device such as a radio frequency identification (RFID) chip which has stored thereon identification information for the carrier. Positioned throughout the system are communications devices such as antennas and readers which are employed to read and/or write identification information on the chip. When a carrier is put in the system, a destination location can be associated with the particular carrier ID. This associated information is then employed to, among many things, monitor and confirm identity of the carrier as it moves to its destination.</div>

<heading>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading> <p num="p-0002">This application is a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/991,303 entitled: “SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CARRIER IDENTIFICATION IN A PNEUMATIC TUBE SYSTEM” and having a filing date of Nov. 17, 2004, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/556,819 having a filing date of Mar. 27, 2004.</p>
<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">The present invention relates generally to the field of pneumatic tube carrier systems, and more particularly to a system and method for improved carrier handling in a pneumatic tube carrier system employing carrier identification carrier monitoring technology such as radio frequency identification (RFID).</p>
  <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0004">Pneumatic tube carrier systems are a well-known means for the automated transport of materials between a multitude of locations, any of which may be the origination location or destination location of a transport carrier. A typical system includes a number of pneumatic tubes interconnected in a network to transport carriers between a number of user stations. Various blowers and transfer units provide the force and path control means, respectively, for moving the carriers through and from tube-to-tube within the system.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">Directing traffic in a pneumatic tube carrier system is a system control center (SCC). An SCC may determine carrier paths, or routes, through a system, carrier location within a system, and carrier path change solutions in situations where gridlock conditions occur. In current systems, such determinations are largely based upon “predictions”, or inferences, as to where each carrier “should be” within a system given the times/locations of entry and intended transport paths of all carriers concurrently handled by the system.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">In current practice, however, carriers can be delivered to locations other than their intended destinations for several reasons. For example, a system may misdirect a given carrier as a result of equipment error. Alternatively, a system may misdirect numerous carriers as a result of the presence of a “floater” carrier (e.g., an unidentified carrier) within a system. That is, the presence of even a single, unaccounted for carrier may severely undermine the accuracy of a number of prediction-based determinations made by an SCC, thereby adversely impacting the handling of numerous carriers.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0007">Described herein is an improved system and method for carrier handling in a pneumatic tube carrier system. Included in the system are a plurality of communications devices such as antenna devices/readers which are positionable at locations throughout the system, wherein the communications devices are configured to communicate with identification devices positionable on carriers employed in the system. Further included in the system are a plurality of user interface devices positionable at various locations within the system (e.g., origination/destination locations), wherein the user interface devices are minimally configurable to receive destination information which may be associated with a particular carrier (e.g., as input by a user).</p>
  <p num="p-0008">The communications and interface devices are further connectable to a central controller, wherein the controller is configurable (i) to receive carrier identification information from communication devices and destination/routing information from the interface devices, and to (ii) associate the destination information and identification information for a particular carrier transport operation, wherein a “transaction record” may be initiated and stored. In turn, as one or more carriers move within the system, the central controller is able to monitor actual carrier location.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">The central controller may be configured to employ the identification information associated with the carriers in a number of different scenarios. In a typical scenario, the central controller may receive identification information for a carrier positioned at an origination location (e.g., via a communications device located at the origination station). In conjunction with the receipt of the identification information, destination information may be entered by a system user through a user interface device located at the origination station. The central controller may then associate the identification information with the destination information by one or more central database entries to initiate a carrier transaction record. In addition to identification, origination and destination information it will be appreciated that the database entries/transaction records may further include, inter alia, one or more of the following: date and/or time information (e.g., arrival/dispatch times), security information (e.g., access restrictions), status information, and/or carrier type information. The central controller may then employ preprogrammed control logic to process a given transaction. Most typically, the central controller may determine a path for carrier travel through the system and provide control instructions to routing controllers to control carrier transport operations.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">Once a carrier reaches a destination station, a communications device located at the destination station may be employed to extract the corresponding identification information and update transaction information associated with the carrier. Such transaction information may be stored in the identification device for a given carrier and/or otherwise maintained by the central controller in a central database (e.g., in a transaction record). In the latter case, if the actual destination of a given carrier is not the same as the intended destination, the central controller may provide alarm or other alert signals to user interfaces provided at either or both of the origination and destination stations.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">As mentioned above, the communications devices are positionable at various locations throughout the system. These locations may include origination/destination stations as well as intermediate locations (i.e., between origination and destination locations). For instance, system routing controllers, e.g., transfer stations, transfer control units (TCUs), and multi-linear transport units (MTUs) as well as the system's pneumatic tubes may incorporate one or more communications devices. Positioning the communications devices at various locations throughout the system provides for monitoring, or tracking, the actual location of carriers as they proceed through the system. Such functionality facilitates a number of system capabilities. For instance, such information (e.g., tracking information) can be used by central controller to address issues that may arise through unforeseen conditions in the system, such as the presence of a “floater”.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">In one configuration of the system, the plurality of communications devices is radio frequency identification (RFID) compatible, e.g., wherein each carrier may include a RFID identification chip which is configured to communicate with a plurality of antenna devices/readers. Both the antenna devices/readers and the identification chips may be programmed in a read-only configuration, wherein information is only readable off a RFID chip by a reader. Alternatively, readers and RFID chips may be provided for read/write operations, wherein information is readable from a chip as well as writeable thereon. Further, hybrid systems are employable which provide for both read and limited write functions for RFID chips (e.g., certain fields of information on the chips are only readable and other fields of information on the chips are readable/writable). However, it will be appreciated that other communication devices/readers may be utilized. Such devices include, without limitation, bar codes and optical readers.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">In one aspect of the present invention, the communication devices and identification devices allow for maintaining a predetermined inventory of carriers at different locations throughout the system. In this regard, records stored accessible by the central controller may include inventory records for each station and/or carrier within the system. Each time a carrier is dispatched and/or received by a station, a data entry associated with the quantity of available carriers for such that station may be updated. Likewise, the identity of the carrier received/dispatched may be cross-checked with the inventory records. In this regard, if a user physically transports a carrier between stations, the inventory records of both stations may be accurately adjusted to indicate their actual inventory. That is, the inventory of the station from which the carrier was removed may be adjusted even though the carrier was dispatched from another station.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">Based on the inventory record, spare carriers may be directed to a station having less than a predetermined inventory of carriers. In this regard, the system may be operative to dynamically maintain a predetermined inventory of carriers at each user station. Stated otherwise, a controller may be operative to automatically redistribute inventory carriers that are either located at carrier storage locations within the system or re-entered into the system in an empty state. Carrier storage locations may include, without limitation, system routing controllers (e.g., MTUs, TCUs, etc) as well as dedicated empty carrier storage repositories. Furthermore, such inventories may be established and maintained on a carrier-type specific basis, as will be discussed herein.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">In conjunction with providing inventory control of the carriers, the system may be operative to provide various user prompts/messages to the user stations in order to maintain desired inventories. For instance, a station having an excess number of carriers may receive a message or prompt requesting that an empty carrier be returned to the system for redistribution. As will be appreciated, the present aspect allows for maintaining a predetermined inventory of carriers at each user station without necessitating that each carrier be assigned to a particular station.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">In another aspect of the present invention, the system may be configured to differently route carriers of different types. For example, in certain situations a system operator may wish to use different types of carriers to carry different types of material (e.g., between different system zones). That is, the system may be operative to segregate general use and special use carriers without human intervention. For instance, in hospital applications, certain carriers may be designated for use in carrying biological materials (e.g., test samples) whereas other carriers may be utilized for general use (e.g., paperwork). Accordingly, in some instances it may be desirable to prevent co-mingling of different carriers types and/or utilizing the same transport tubes for different carrier types. In this regard, routing decisions for the carriers may be based on traffic conditions as well as carrier type.</p>
  <p num="p-0017">The system may utilize identification information from the carriers to identify a carrier type associated with the carriers. Based on the carrier type, one or more actions within the system may be restricted. For instance, a user may be prevented from sending a special use carrier to a general use station. That is, a carrier type may be compared to an allowable carrier type associated with a destination and/or present location of a carrier. Accordingly, an output may be generated, for example, a warning indicating that an incompatible carrier/user station combination exists. Such warning may be provided on a display device and/or as an audible alarm.</p>
  <p num="p-0018">In instances when an incompatible carrier/user station combination exists, the carrier may be dynamically routed to an acceptable recovery location. Preferably, identification of incompatible carrier may be provided to an intended destination station and/or to an origination station for such an incompatible carrier such that system users may take remedial steps to recover the carrier.</p>
  <p num="p-0019">In another aspect of the present invention, transaction records may be generated that provide actual travel path information for the carriers. In this regard, the transaction records may identification information, location information, and time information corresponding to when a carrier is located at a given location within the pneumatic carrier system (e.g., relative to a communications device). Accordingly, the time and location for the carrier may be stored to the transaction record on a computer readable storage medium. As the carrier travels through the system relative to various communication devices therein, additional entries may be added to the transaction record such that a travel path for the carrier may be generated. This travel path may be utilized for monitoring purposes to determine, for example, receipt of restricted items (e.g., controlled substances) as well as for system maintenance purposes, as will be discussed herein.</p>
  <p num="p-0020">In another aspect of the present invention, the system may be operative to facilitate remedial steps in the event of receipt of a suspect/compromised carrier. For instance, in the event that a received carrier is leaking its contents, a user may provide a suspect carrier input at the receiving user station.</p>
  <p num="p-0021">In response to this input, the system may obtain the identification information of the suspect carrier. Accordingly, this identification information may be correlated with the stored entry/transaction records that include travel path information through the system for the suspect carrier. Based on this travel path information, one or more portions of the travel path through the pneumatic carrier may be deactivated. Such deactivated portions of the system may then be treated in a remedial fashion by maintenance personnel. Furthermore, the system may be configured to access transaction records associated with all carriers traveling through the system during a period of time associated with the transport of the suspect carrier. For instance, all carriers subsequently passing through the travel path of the suspect carrier may be identified. In turn, instructive messages may be sent to corresponding user interfaces so that potentially affected carriers may be inspected and otherwise handled in accordance with pre-established protocols. As will be appreciated, messages may also be provided system wide to each user station and/or user interface. Alternatively, the travel path associated with each of those carriers may be deactivated for remedial purposes. Likewise, the entire system may be deactivated upon receipt of the suspect carrier input.</p>
  <p num="p-0022">According to another aspect of the present invention, the identification information associated with each carrier may be utilized to provide a confirmation of proper carrier location within the system. For instance, upon receiving a pneumatic carrier in the system the identification information from the identification device associated with the pneumatic carrier may be read. Accordingly, that identification information may be associated with a transaction record currently associated with the carrier. A destination location from the transaction record may then be compared with the current location of the pneumatic carrier such that the pneumatic carrier may be identified (1) as being at a correct location or (2) as being at an incorrect location. In one arrangement, when the carrier is at an incorrect location the method may further include dynamically re-routing the carrier to the location associated with the destination information. That is, the carrier may be automatically re-routed to its correct destination location. Alternatively and/or in addition, an output may be generated indicating the carrier is at an incorrect location. Such an output may be provided at the location of the carrier, the origination location of the carrier and/or an intended destination location for the carrier.</p>
  <p num="p-0023">In another aspect of the invention, the system may utilize carrier transaction information to facilitate re-initiation of the system after a power outage and/or an urgent off situation. That is, subsequent to an urgent off or power loss, each of the carriers in a system needs to be identified and routed to their intended destinations upon reinitiation. For such purposes, the central controller, which is in communication with the various communications devices, may read the identification information from the carriers in the system and then compare the identification information with database/transaction records. If the carriers and their corresponding records can be identified, their routing information is retrieved from memory and then employed to dynamically route the carriers to their destinations in a normal fashion. The controller may be configured to systematically read each carrier identification device in all the various temporary storage locations in the system such as the MTUs and TCUs until the traffic is cleared. If a carrier cannot be identified, it may be moved to a recovery zone. Once all the carriers are either routed to their destinations or a recovery zone, the system may resume normal operations.</p>
  <p num="p-0024">In a further aspect of the invention, the system may utilize carrier transaction information to facilitate scheduled carrier maintenance. By way of example, the central controller may utilize carrier transaction information from a database that keeps track of the number of transactions, or time in service, for each carrier, and compare such information to predetermined maintenance thresholds to determine whether a given carrier should be removed from the system for inspection/maintenance procedures. In the event a maintenance operation and inspection/maintenance operation is in order, the transaction information for a given carrier can be utilized to identify the location of the carrier and provide instructions to the corresponding user station (e.g., instructions to send the given carrier to a inspection/maintenance location within the system).</p>
  <p num="p-0025">In another aspect of the present invention, user interface devices located within the system (e.g., at origination and destination stations) may be provided to allow system users access and display transaction records associated with system carriers. Such records may include the dispatch and/or receipt information for a given carrier and/or for a given station. In this regard, a user may utilize the interface devices to review transaction histories for carriers and/or stations. Further, such interface devices may be used to provide information relating to the occurrence of an event within the system. For instance, a display device associated with such an interface device may be operative to provide a visual indication that a pneumatic carrier dispatched from an origination station has arrived at a second location in the system (e.g., a destination station). Likewise, the destination station may be operative to provide an indication that a pneumatic carrier is destined for that location and/or arrived at that location. Further, the user interface devices may provide indications regarding the location of one or more carriers as those carriers pass through the system (e.g., from an origination station to a destination system).</p>
  <p num="p-0026">The visual indications generated at the user interfaces regarding the occurrence of an event within the system may include text messages. Such text messages may indicate, inter alia, the origination location of a carrier, a destination location for the carrier, an identification of a sending party, an identification of a receiving party, the priority of the carrier, an indication of the contents of the carrier and/or a current status of the carrier (e.g., in transit, ETA, etc.). Preferably, such messages may be displayed proximate to the user stations for user convenience.</p>
  <p num="p-0027">In one particular arrangement of the present aspect, the display device may provide a graphical representation of the pneumatic carrier system. Such a graphical representation may include visual indicia (e.g., icons) that relate to system components such as destination/origination stations, transfer units, blowers, tubes etc. Accordingly, the position of one or more pneumatic carriers may be depicted on the graphical representation of the pneumatic carrier system. These positions may be updated such that the movement of the carriers through the system may be monitored (e.g., in substantially real-time).</p>
  <p num="p-0028">As will be appreciated, use of a graphical representation of the pneumatic carrier system may further allow for providing a visual indication of the current status of one or more systems within the system. For instance, if a portion of the system is offline or otherwise inactive, appropriate representation may be provided on the graphical representation. Furthermore, such a graphical representation may be provided on a user interface that is not associated with a particular destination and/or origination location. That is, such a graphical representation may be provided at a central controller/system administrator location such that overall status of the system may be monitored remotely. As will be appreciated, a graphical user interface may be incorporated in to the present arrangement to allow touch screen control of various system functions.</p>
  <p num="p-0029">Numerous additional configurations and advantages of the present invention as facilitated by the present invention would be apparent to those skilled in the art upon consideration of the further description that follows.</p>

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading> <p num="p-0045">Disclosed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a system diagram for a pneumatic carrier system <b>10</b> within which the invention described herein is employable. In general, the pneumatic carrier system <b>10</b> transport pneumatic carriers between various user stations <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, each such transport operation being referred to herein as a “transaction”. At each of the user stations <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, a user may insert a carrier, select/enter a destination address/identification and a transaction priority, and then send the carrier. The system determines an optimum path to route the carrier and begins directing the carrier through the system.</p>
  <p num="p-0046">Interconnected with each station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> is a transfer unit <b>20</b> which orders carriers arriving through different tubes from a different stations <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> into a single pneumatic tube. This pneumatic tube is further in connection with a vacuum by-pass transfer unit <b>21</b> (i.e., turn around transfer unit) and a blower <b>22</b> that provides the driving pneumatic force for container movement. A set of transfer units <b>20</b>, a blower <b>22</b> and one or more stations <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> typically define a single zone, with a corresponding by-pass transfer unit <b>21</b> being a point of connection to a network and the other zones connected thereto.</p>
  <p num="p-0047">Within the system <b>10</b> itself, one or more devices are employable for ordering and routing carriers to their selected destinations. One type of device is a traffic control unit (TCU) <b>14</b> which is employable to receive, temporarily store and release a number of carriers. In certain configurations, one or more TCUs <b>14</b> may be provided to operate as linear storage devices, e.g., on a first in first out (FIFO) basis or last in first out (LIFO) basis. In other configurations, one or more TCUs <b>14</b> may be provided to operate as matrix style storage devices which store carriers in two-dimensional matrixes, wherein each carrier is separately storable, retrievable and releasable without movement of other carriers stored in the matrix.</p>
  <p num="p-0048">Also included in the system <b>10</b> are multi-linear transfer units (MTUs) <b>12</b> which have functionality to direct carriers from one pneumatic tube to another. For example, a MTU <b>12</b> may receive a carrier released by a TCU <b>14</b> in a first tube and direct the carrier along a second pneumatic tube in the system <b>10</b> to complete a given transaction. The configuration of the TCUs <b>14</b> and MTUs <b>12</b> will be described in greater detail below.</p>
  <p num="p-0049">All of the components described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are electronically connected to a central controller which controls their operation. Disclosed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an electrical system diagram for the pneumatic carrier system <b>10</b> described herein. Providing centralized control for the entire pneumatic carrier system <b>10</b> is a system central controller (SCC) <b>30</b>. The SCC <b>30</b> may include a digital processor and memory. SCC <b>30</b> may be configured as one or more programmable digital computers. Connectable to the SCC <b>30</b> may be one or more user interfaces <b>32</b> through which a system user may monitor the operations of the system and/or manually enter one or more commands to control its operation. Typically, at least one user interface <b>32</b> is located at or within an area serviced by stations <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. For example, in a medical facility application, one or more user stations <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> and at least one user interface <b>32</b> may be provided within each emergency room, laboratory, nursing station, etc. In this regard, the user interface may be contained in the stations <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, or be stand-alone units.</p>
  <p num="p-0050">Each of the components described above in relation to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may include one or more electrical and/or electro-mechanical components which provide for the physical movement of a carrier within the system <b>10</b> and/or the obtainment/provision of information relating to the location of the carriers within the system <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0051">In this regard, components <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are representations of the various electrical and electromechanical systems that may be employed by the pneumatic carrier system <b>10</b>. Although in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> they are represented single blocks, one skilled in the art will realize that the block for each type of device represents the electronics for a number of the same or similar type of components positioned throughout the system which provides for its operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">Of note, incorporated into each of the user stations <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, MTUs <b>12</b> and TCUs <b>14</b> is at least one antenna device/reader <b>40</b> configured to energize and retrieve identification information from identification devices such as ID chips incorporated into each of the carriers. As will be appreciated, the utilization of antenna devices/readers <b>40</b> and carrier ID chips yield significant advantages in the described system <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0053">Disclosed in the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a view of a pneumatic system carrier <b>100</b> which includes at least one identification device, or, as shown ID chip <b>29</b>. Though shown as a small, integrated chip, it will be appreciated that other identification devices may be used and that the configuration and location of the identification device may vary. For instance, the identification device may be formed as a band disposed about the circumference of the carrier <b>100</b> to allow reading the identification device by an antenna device/reader <b>40</b> irrespective of the orientation of the carrier <b>100</b>. In a typical carrier, the carrier <b>100</b> includes first and second shell members <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> which are adjoinably cylindrical in cross-section for use in correspondingly cylindrical tubes of the system <b>10</b>. The shell members <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> may be pivotably interconnected by a hinge member (not shown), and latches <b>28</b> may be provided for securing the first shell member to the second shell member in a closed configuration. Also included as part of the carrier <b>100</b> are wear bands <b>44</b>, <b>48</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">Incorporated into one of the shell members <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> and/or wear bands <b>44</b>, <b>48</b> (e.g., disposed beneath one or both bands <b>44</b>, <b>48</b>) is the ID chip <b>29</b>. This ID chip <b>29</b> is configured to store and provide access to identification information written thereon. In one configuration of the system, the ID chip <b>29</b> may be a read-only chip. That is, an antenna device <b>40</b> may only read information off the ID chip <b>29</b>. Typically, these types of ID chips <b>29</b>, or tags, are sequentially numbered at a production facility to ensure that the customer gets tags with truly unique numbers. Further, such ID chips <b>29</b> may be encrypted or include encrypted information such as a code that may be, for example, specific to a given system <b>10</b>. Use of such encryption may prevent the use of non-authorized carriers <b>100</b> in the system <b>10</b>, which may not be correctly configured for the system <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0055">Alternatively, ID chips <b>29</b> may be provided so that an antenna <b>40</b> may write information to the ID chips <b>29</b> as well as read data therefrom. For example, information corresponding with an origination station, time of departure, intended destination station, actual destination station and/or time of arrival may be written into the chips <b>29</b>. Further, the identity of a person who has performed a certain operation in relation to a transported material can be written to the corresponding ID chip <b>29</b> along with the date and time the action was performed. When the carrier <b>100</b> containing the material moves from a first station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> to a second station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, information can be read off the ID chip <b>29</b> and sent to the SCC <b>30</b> (e.g., for storage). In some instances, the ID chips <b>29</b> may be read while the carrier <b>100</b> is in motion (i.e., on the fly). In this regard, antenna device/readers may be incorporated into pneumatic tubes within the system <b>10</b> as well as the system components such as <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>. In any case, data read from the ID chips <b>29</b> can then be stored and augmented and/or replaced by identity, date and time information corresponding with further actions performed at a second station location.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">Another alternative is a hybrid system that uses write capable ID chips <b>29</b> that are custom configured by the user in a read-only system. An example of the type of information that may be written on such an ID chip <b>29</b> may include a home station/identification address for each carrier <b>100</b>. In such arrangements, after a carrier <b>100</b> has reached a destination station, the corresponding home station information may be accessed and employed to automatically return the carrier <b>100</b> to a home station upon initiation of an empty send operation at the destination station.</p>
  <p num="p-0057">As was noted above, antennas devices/readers <b>40</b> may be incorporated into each of the various user stations <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, TCUs <b>14</b> and MTUs <b>16</b> of a pneumatic tube system. Disclosed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a breakaway view of an exemplary MTU <b>12</b> embodiment including an antenna device/reader <b>40</b>. As can be seen, the MTU <b>12</b> is interconnected with a number of incoming tubes <b>56</b> through which carriers are delivered to the MTU <b>12</b>. Exiting from the MTU <b>12</b> are a number of exit tubes <b>56</b> which direct a carrier to a destination zone. Included in the MTU <b>12</b> is a carrier delivery device <b>72</b> (e.g., a bucket <b>72</b>) which is moveable along guides <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> so as to receive carriers directed to the MTU <b>12</b> through pneumatic tubes <b>56</b> and then, in response to an instruction signal received from the SCC <b>30</b>, if necessary, move the received carrier along the guides <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> to align the carrier with a selected exit pneumatic tube <b>56</b>. Once a pneumatic vacuum force is applied to the selected exit tube <b>56</b>, the bucket <b>72</b> releases the carrier.</p>
  <p num="p-0058">Also included in the MTU <b>12</b> are one or more antenna devices/readers <b>40</b>. These antenna devices/readers <b>40</b> are in communication with the SCC and configured to perform the read functions and write functions, if so configured, in relation to the ID chips incorporated into carriers which pass through the MTU <b>12</b>. As can be seen, a number of antenna devices/readers <b>40</b> may be positioned relative to the pneumatic tubes <b>56</b> such that the movement of a carrier into and out of each of the pneumatic tubes <b>56</b> may be monitored.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">Disclosed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a breakaway view of an exemplary TCU <b>14</b> embodiment interconnected with a pneumatic carrier tube <b>56</b> within the system <b>10</b>. The TCU <b>14</b> includes a sleeve portion <b>50</b> which is sized to receive and hold a number of carriers <b>100</b>. The TCU <b>50</b> includes a receipt mechanism <b>60</b> which provides for the entry of carriers <b>100</b> into the sleeve portion <b>50</b>. Also included is an exit mechanism <b>52</b>, controllable by the SCC <b>30</b>, which provides for the release of a carrier <b>100</b> from the TCU <b>14</b>. Also includable in the TCU <b>14</b> is at least one antenna device/reader <b>40</b> which may be employable to identify carriers <b>100</b> received within the TCU <b>14</b> and provide this information to the SCC <b>30</b>. In one configuration, antenna device/reader <b>40</b> may encircle a portion of the TCU <b>50</b>, and when an ID chip <b>29</b> on a carrier <b>100</b> passes within proximity of the antenna device/reader <b>53</b>, the identification information may be extracted therefrom. In the configuration of the system where the TCU <b>14</b> is constructed of mostly metallic materials, the portion of the TCU <b>14</b> in which the antenna device/reader <b>40</b> is located may be constructed of a material that is different from the rest of the TCU <b>14</b>. For example, this portion may be made of a plastic material so as not to interfere with the operation of the antenna device/reader <b>40</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0060">Returning again to the electrical system diagram of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it may be seen that various transfer units <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> and blowers <b>22</b> are also electrically connectable to the SCC <b>30</b>. Through these connections, SCC <b>30</b> may send command signals to these devices so that they are actuated and operating at particular times and in particular sequences to affect the completion of the various carrier transactions. Other signals exchanged may include various monitoring signals that indicate the devices are operating as desired.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the SCC <b>30</b> is connectable to the various stations <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> throughout the pneumatic carrier system <b>10</b> which are the origination and destination points for carriers <b>100</b>. Signals transmitted between the SCC <b>30</b> and the stations <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> relate to carrier identification information. Further, signals transmitted between user interfaces <b>32</b> and the SCC <b>30</b> may relate to destination and priority information entered for particular transactions, indications that a transaction has been initiated and/or completed, and various operational signals (e.g., alarms) which relate to the operational status of a user station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0062">The SCC <b>30</b> is further connectable to a transaction archive <b>33</b>, or database, which is configured to store transaction information for carriers <b>100</b> moving within the system <b>10</b>. The transaction information may include identification information for carriers <b>100</b> moving through the system and destination information entered by a system user. Further, the transaction information may include location information obtained via tracking inputs received from antenna devices/readers <b>40</b> located at user stations <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, TCUs <b>12</b> and MTUs <b>16</b> along the travel path of a given carrier <b>100</b>. The transaction information may also include security information entered by system user to limit who may receive the carrier <b>100</b>. Still further, transaction information may also include a designation of a “type” of a carrier <b>100</b> as well as information as to whether a carrier <b>100</b> has reached a selected destination. The use of this transaction data will be described in greater detailed below.</p>
  <p num="p-0063">The external systems <b>35</b> connected may depend on the purpose of the pneumatic carrier system <b>10</b>. For example, the external systems <b>35</b> may include a lab information system, a pharmacy information system, a patient information system, as well as a security information system.</p>
  <p num="p-0064">In operation, the antenna devices/readers <b>40</b> positioned throughout the pneumatic carrier system identify carriers <b>100</b> as they pass from one location to another. Generally, when a carrier <b>100</b> is to be employed for carrying some type of object from an origination station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> to a destination station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, it may be identified using the antenna device/reader <b>40</b> at the origination station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. Once a destination is selected for the particular carrier <b>100</b>, the identification information may be associated with the path calculated for the carrier <b>100</b> through the pneumatic carrier system <b>10</b> and the destination. This information may be stored in a data entry (e.g., transaction record) within the transaction archive <b>33</b>. As the carrier <b>100</b> moves from one location to another, the antenna device/reader <b>40</b> at the various locations will energize the ID chip <b>29</b> and extract the identification information. Once a carrier <b>100</b> reaches a destination, the ID chip <b>29</b> information may then be confirmed against transactions that are intended to be received at the particular destination. Additionally, upon arrival at a destination, a confirmation may be provided to the origination station.</p>
  <p num="p-0065"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>6</b> <i>b </i>are front views of a station <b>16</b> which is employable in the pneumatic carrier system <b>10</b> described herein. As shown, the station <b>16</b> includes a dispatcher connected to a pneumatic tube <b>56</b> that is employable for transporting and delivering carriers <b>100</b> to and from the station <b>16</b>. Also included with the station <b>16</b> is a user interface <b>32</b> that includes a control panel <b>108</b> that has a number of interactive devices which a system user may employ for entering data including, for example, destination information, priority information, and security information (e.g., a personal identification number (PIN)). The control panel <b>108</b> is also employable for entering data for a carrier <b>100</b> received at a station. For example, if a carrier <b>100</b> has a security limitation associated with it, release authorization information can be entered to complete delivery of the carrier <b>100</b> at the destination location. Also included with the user interface <b>32</b> is a display <b>110</b> which is configured to present messages relating to transaction and system status which are viewable by a system user. The use of the user interface <b>32</b> will be described in greater detail below.</p>
  <p num="p-0066">Also positioned relative to the dispatcher <b>60</b> are a carrier holder <b>62</b> and an antenna device/reader <b>40</b>. As with the other antenna devices/readers <b>40</b> described above, this device is configured to read information, and write information if so configured, on an ID chip <b>29</b> incorporated into a carrier <b>100</b>. Though shown as utilizing a single antenna device/reader <b>40</b>, it will be appreciated that the station <b>16</b> may include two or more such devices. That is, the station <b>16</b> may include a first antenna device/reader for reading ID chips <b>29</b> on carriers that are received by the station <b>16</b> (e.g., prior to releasing the received carrier in response to an authorization code) as well as a second antenna device/reader <b>40</b> associated with the dispatcher <b>60</b>. The holder <b>62</b> is configured such that a system user may place a carrier on the holder <b>62</b> and enter destination information through the control panel <b>108</b>. Once all the appropriate information has been entered, the dispatcher <b>60</b> will move the carrier <b>100</b> into a pneumatic tube <b>56</b> for transport to a selected destination.</p>
  <p num="p-0067"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-11</figref> illustrate the use of the user interface <b>32</b> to perform various functions within the system <b>10</b>.

As shown, the user interface <b>32</b> includes the control panel <b>108</b> and a display <b>110</b>. The control panel <b>108</b> includes a number of “speed-dial” buttons <b>12</b> that may be programmed to allow a user to insert a carrier <b>100</b> into the dispatcher <b>60</b>, select a preprogrammed destination station by depressing a corresponding speed-dial button <b>112</b>, and dispatch the carrier <b>100</b> by depressing the send/enter button <b>114</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0068">In addition, the control panel <b>108</b> includes a numeric keypad <b>116</b> for use in manually entering, for example, destination station information. The control panel <b>108</b> also includes a number of general action buttons including, for example, an empty return/send button <b>118</b> that allows for returning an empty carrier <b>100</b> to the system <b>10</b> for distribution to stations <b>16</b> that may be deficient of carriers <b>100</b>. Further, the control panel <b>108</b> includes track carrier <b>120</b> and call carrier <b>122</b> functions, respectively, that will be discussed herein. Finally, the control panel <b>108</b> includes a menu button <b>124</b> that allows for accessing further system functions via the display <b>110</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0069">Illustrative functions that may be accessed via the menu button <b>124</b> in use of the display <b>110</b> may include, without limitation, special user functions, administrative functions, station operating help instructions, and/or a station directory for use in identifying destination stations. In this regard, upon depressing the menu button <b>124</b>, a list of options may be provided within the display <b>110</b>. The user may then use the up and down buttons <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> for use in scrolling through listed menu options. A desired option may be highlighted on the screen utilizing the buttons <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> and selected by depressing the send/enter button <b>114</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0070">Special functions may include activating and deactivating the station <b>16</b>. In this regard, a station <b>16</b> may be deactivated when a user is not present. Likewise, the station <b>16</b> may be reactivated when a user is present. Further, carriers <b>100</b> may be forwarded to another station in the system <b>10</b>. As will be appreciated, utilization of such special functions may require a user to enter a personal identification number (PIN) or other authorization code using, for example, the numerical keypad <b>116</b>. Additional functions that may be incorporated into the special functions menu may include viewing incoming carriers <b>100</b> (e.g., by depressing the call carrier button <b>122</b>), which may allow a user to identify, for example, how many carriers are destined for the station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, priority status for the carrier(s) and/or the origin of the incoming carrier(s). Further, the menu button <b>124</b> may be utilized to set a number of alarms or other audible indicators. Such indicators may include an indicator upon arrival of a carrier <b>100</b> that sounds each time a carrier <b>100</b> arrives, or a full station indicator that sounds when the station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> is full and cannot receive any additional carriers <b>100</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0071">The track carrier button <b>120</b> allows for a user of a station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> to track the progress of a carrier <b>100</b> as it proceed to its destination. In this regard, a user may place a carrier <b>100</b> in the station dispatcher <b>60</b> and depress the track carrier button <b>120</b> on the control pad <b>108</b>.

In this case, the carrier is identified as number <b>321</b>. Further, the display <b>110</b> may include such information as the station from which the carrier <b>100</b> was dispatched as well as the dispatch time, date, and carrier destination. The output of the display <b>110</b> may also be sent to the SCC <b>30</b> for storage in the transaction archive <b>33</b>. See <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In this regard, the output of the display <b>110</b> may correspond to a transaction record for the dispatch and receipt of a given carrier between stations.</p>
  <p num="p-0073"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates output of the display <b>110</b> upon the carrier <b>100</b> arriving at its destination station. In this regard, the display <b>110</b> output shows the time when the carrier <b>100</b> was received at the destination station. As will be appreciated, the destination station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> may utilize an antenna device/reader <b>40</b> to read the ID chip <b>29</b> of the carrier <b>100</b> received by that station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> to confirm the carrier <b>100</b> is indeed the carrier <b>100</b> (e.g., ID no. <b>321</b>) that was sent by the origination station <b>16</b>. That is, the information read from the carrier <b>100</b> may be checked against the transaction record, which may be stored at the archive <b>33</b>. Finally, it will be noted that the transaction record displayed by the departure station <b>16</b> may also be displayed at the arrival station (e.g., incoming carrier). Additionally, the transaction record may be stored within the archive <b>33</b> by the SCC <b>30</b> for future retrieval purposes. In this regard, all transactions occurring within the system <b>10</b> may be stored.</p>
  <p num="p-0074">As all transactions performed by the system may be stored within the archive <b>33</b>, users may have the ability to retrieve past transactions. As will be appreciated, such functionality may be desirable for auditing purposes and/or for system cleaning purposes upon detection of a leaking carrier. In this regard, through an interface <b>32</b>, a user may access previous dispatches and/or receipts (transactions) by an identified station. Such transactions may be provided in chronological order and/or by the order in which carriers passed through a selected portion of the system. Access to such information may require pass code authorization.</p>
  <p num="p-0075"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> show an alternate embodiment of a user interface <b>32</b> that may be utilized with the user stations <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> and/or in stand-alone user interfaces <b>32</b>. In particular, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> show a graphical user interface <b>132</b> that may be utilized in conjunction with a personal computer or other display device. For instance, such a graphical user interface <b>132</b> may be incorporated into the user stations <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> and may further utilize a touch screen monitor to allow for selecting system transaction options. As shown, the graphical user interface <b>132</b> may provide a graphical depiction of components within the system <b>10</b>. That is, the interface provides visual indicia, for example, icons that relate to the system components and lay out of the system <b>10</b>. For instance, the graphical user interface my provide visual indicia of the blower(s) <b>22</b>, bypass transfer units <b>21</b>, transfer units <b>20</b>, user stations <b>18</b>, etc. Furthermore, a position of a given carrier may be depicted on the graphical user interface <b>132</b>. In this regard, a user may visually monitor the progress of a given transaction as a carrier <b>100</b> passes through the system <b>10</b>. Accordingly, antennae devices/readers <b>40</b> may be incorporated throughout the system <b>10</b> for use in monitoring the progress of a given carrier transaction. The graphical user interface <b>132</b> may incorporate any of the functions discussed above in regard to the user interface of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0076">The graphical user interface <b>132</b> may further include a number of tabs <b>134</b> and/or pull down menus to allow a user to access different functions. For instance, by selecting the event log tab <b>134</b>A, a user may access transaction histories for an identified station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> and/or carrier <b>100</b>. It will be appreciated that the user station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> may be selected via the graphical user interface <b>132</b> (e.g., utilizing a mouse or touch screen system). Furthermore, it will be noted that a transaction record similar to that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> may be overlaid onto a portion of the graphical user interface <b>132</b> for monitoring purposes.</p>
  <p num="p-0077">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the system tab <b>134</b>B is selected such that the configuration of the entire system <b>10</b> is provided on the graphical user interface <b>132</b>. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, it will be noted that the riser tab <b>134</b>C is selected such that a single zone may be shown. Of course, variations may be made as deemed fit by a user and/or system administrator.</p>
  <p num="p-0078">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, it will be noted that the graphical user interface <b>132</b> allows for showing the status <b>136</b> of various sections of the system <b>10</b>. In this regard, by utilizing shading and/or color-coding, the status of various components within the system <b>10</b> may be visually indicated. For instance, if a user station is signed off (i.e., inactive), the graphical depiction on the graphical user interface may indicate that the particular user station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> is inactive by showing the station in a predetermined “inactive color,” or, by not displaying the inactive station. Further, if certain portions of the system <b>10</b> are clearing, down, partially active, purging carriers and/or loading carriers, appropriate visual indications may be provided on the screen.</p>
  <p num="p-0079">The use of a graphical user interface <b>132</b> provides an intuitive interface for users of the system. Furthermore, the graphical user interface <b>132</b> in conjunction with the ID chips <b>29</b> on the carriers allows for a system administrator to monitor all carrier traffic currently within the system and/or located at user station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> (e.g., awaiting processing).</p>
  <p num="p-0080">Further, the system <b>10</b> described herein is also employable for identifying carriers in case of non-typical circumstances. Some of the non-typical circumstances will be described in greater detail below.</p>
  <p num="p-0081">Disclosed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12</figref> <i>a </i>and <i>b </i>are flowcharts which describe the typical operation of the system when a carrier <b>100</b> is put in the system <b>10</b> at a station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> and a destination location is selected. As a first step of the process (<b>1200</b>), the system will read (<b>1202</b>) carrier information (e.g., identification) off the ID chip <b>29</b> incorporated into the carrier <b>100</b>. If there is a read failure at this point, that is, if ID information cannot be read (<b>1204</b>) from the ID chip <b>29</b>, an error message will be posted (<b>1208</b>) on the display <b>110</b> at the station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. If an ID is read, the destination information entered by a system user at the station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> is received (<b>1212</b>) and employed to create a transaction which is then associated (<b>1216</b>) with the carrier ID for the particular carrier <b>100</b>. This transaction may then be stored in the transaction archive <b>33</b> for future access. The SCC <b>30</b> will then calculate (<b>1220</b>) a path through the system <b>10</b> for the carrier <b>10</b> based on the destination information. The carrier <b>10</b> is then routed (<b>1224</b>) through the system <b>10</b> accordingly.</p>
  <p num="p-0082">One purpose of the present invention is to reduce the potential for misdirected carriers <b>100</b> in the system <b>10</b>. Many systems include multiple carrier lines and have generally higher overall traffic levels and as such, the incidence of a “floater” (i.e., an out of sync carrier) will greatly disrupt the typically first-in-first-out (FIFO) processing of transactions. As such, as a carrier <b>100</b> is routed through the system <b>10</b> in typical operations, an ID chip <b>29</b> may be read and analyzed at multiple locations in the system <b>10</b> to verify that the intended destination of the carrier <b>100</b> (the destination where the SCC will send carrier based on FIFO) is the same as the destination for the transaction associated with the carrier ID.</p>
  <p num="p-0083">The process (<b>1230</b>) performed by the system <b>10</b> during the routing and monitoring of the carrier <b>100</b> through the system <b>10</b> are described in the flowchart of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> <i>b</i>. As was mentioned above, antenna devices/readers <b>40</b> are located throughout the system in such locations as the MTUs and TCUs, and are employed to monitor the carriers <b>100</b>. At each of the locations, the antenna devices/readers <b>40</b> read the ID information of the ID chips <b>29</b> and provide this to the SCC <b>30</b>. Upon reading (<b>1240</b>) an ID chip <b>29</b> for a particular carrier <b>100</b> to obtain a particular carrier ID, transaction information for the particular carrier ID will then be retrieved (<b>1244</b>). The destination associated with the transaction information for the carrier <b>100</b> will be compared (<b>1248</b>) against the location of the carrier <b>100</b>. Every time the carrier ID is read at a location within the system <b>100</b>, a determination is made as to whether the particular carrier <b>100</b> matches the destination for the transaction currently being processed. For a match, the system processes the carrier <b>100</b> in a normal fashion (<b>1252</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0084">If the carrier ID does not match the destination information of the transaction being processed, a further query is made as to whether there is destination information stored in memory which is associated with the particular carrier ID (<b>1256</b>). If there is not any destination information associated with the particular carrier ID, the carrier <b>100</b> is then routed to a recovery station and a warning is posted (<b>1260</b>). If there is a destination associated with the carrier ID, the SCC <b>30</b> adjusts its traffic pattern and routes the carrier <b>100</b> accordingly (<b>1264</b>). At that point, the antenna device/reader <b>40</b> at the location is ready to process the next carrier <b>100</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0085">Traditional pneumatic carrier systems can have a maximum number of carriers in transit of approximately 1 carrier per zone plus the number of inter-zone storage lines. The system <b>10</b> described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may have a maximum number of carriers in transit approximately equal to the number of parking spaces (TCU slots) in addition to the pressure/vacuum transactions. During operation of a pneumatic carrier system, the system <b>10</b> may experience an urgent off or a power loss. In the event of an urgent off or a loss of system power the traffic pattern information may be lost and as such the carriers <b>100</b> within the system <b>10</b> need to be identified and re-routed to their intended destination. The carrier ID antenna devices/readers <b>40</b> are employable to obtain identification information for each of the carriers <b>100</b> in the system <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0086">Disclosed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref> <i>a </i>and <i>b </i>is a flowchart which describes in detail the process (<b>1300</b>) performed by the system <b>10</b> after an urgent off or a loss of power. Initially, the system <b>10</b> will detect (<b>1304</b>) that an urgent off or a power loss has occurred. At this point, the pressure/vacuum (P-V) zones will be purged and carriers found within the system will be moved (<b>1308</b>) to designated zones or to the nearest station for identification and redirection. The TCUs <b>14</b> may then be powered/vacuumed to allow carriers therein to reach a final or intermediate destination (<b>1312</b>). At this point, the slide gates of the MTUs <b>12</b> may be cleared (<b>1316</b>) and the bucket <b>72</b> may be checked (<b>1320</b>) for a carrier <b>100</b>. If a carrier <b>100</b> is detected in the bucket <b>72</b>, the carrier ID is read (<b>1324</b>). If no ID is read, the carrier <b>100</b> is sent (<b>1328</b>) to a recovery zone. A warning or alarm is posted by the SCC <b>30</b> indicating that this has been done.</p>
  <p num="p-0087">If the carrier ID is read (<b>1324</b>), the SCC <b>30</b> attempts accesses (<b>1332</b>) the achieve <b>33</b> and attempts to match the carrier ID with a particular transaction in the archive <b>33</b>. The SCC determines (<b>1334</b>) if there is an in progress transaction associated with the carrier ID. If there is no in progress transaction associated with the carrier ID, the carrier is sent (<b>1328</b>) to the designated MTU recovery zone. A warning or alarm may be posted indicating a transaction has been sent to the recovery zone. If there is an active transaction in progress that matches the carrier ID, the transaction is reinitiated (<b>1338</b>) and the carrier <b>100</b> is processed normally to its destination. The transaction may then be noted in an archive as being recovered.</p>
  <p num="p-0088">When the <b>12</b> MTU is determined (<b>1342</b>) to be clear of carriers <b>100</b>, each TCU <b>14</b> above each MTU <b>12</b> is checked (<b>1346</b>) for carriers <b>100</b>. In this regard, the TCU's <b>14</b> may be checked sequentially until all TCU's <b>14</b> have been checked (<b>1350</b>). More particularly, each TCU <b>14</b> is identified in a predetermined order (<b>1354</b>) and checked for carriers <b>100</b>. This may be accomplished by positioning (<b>1358</b>) the bucket <b>72</b> of the corresponding MTU <b>12</b> under the currently active TCU <b>14</b> and confirming that all slide gate and gripper assemblies in the TCU <b>14</b> are closed and then running (<b>1362</b>) the transfer belt in the TCU <b>14</b> for a designated in period of time sufficient to clear the TCU <b>14</b> of carriers(s). In this regard, the bucket <b>72</b> of the MTU <b>12</b> is monitored (<b>1366</b>) to detect a carrier that may be received from the TCU <b>14</b>. If a carrier <b>100</b> is detected in the bucket <b>72</b>, as was discussed above, the SCC <b>30</b> attempts to read (<b>1324</b>) the carrier ID, and then based on the success of the reading and the location of any associated transaction information in the archive <b>33</b>, either reinitiates deliver (<b>1338</b>) of the carrier <b>100</b> to its selected destination or sends (<b>1328</b>) the carrier <b>100</b> to a designated recovery zone.</p>
  <p num="p-0089">If no carrier <b>100</b> is detected in the bucket <b>72</b> after the belt running period, the SCC <b>30</b> then cycles through all the TCU's <b>14</b> above the MTU <b>12</b>. After each TCU <b>14</b> has been verified empty, each bi-pass transfer unit <b>21</b> and transfer unit <b>20</b> above the MTU <b>12</b> are checked sequentially for the number of carriers <b>100</b> present, if any. In this regard, a first transfer unit <b>20</b> is selected (<b>1372</b>) and a reader is utilized to read (<b>1392</b>) an ID chip of a carrier in the transfer unit <b>20</b>, if a carrier is present. If no carrier is present, the next transfer unit <b>20</b> is selected. If a carrier is present, the carrier ID of the carrier <b>100</b> compared with transaction files. If the carrier ID does not match a transaction file (<b>1380</b>), the carrier <b>100</b> is processed into the MTU and sent (<b>1384</b>) to the MTU recovery station. A warning may then be posted by the SCC indicating a transaction has been sent to the recovery station.</p>
  <p num="p-0090">If there is a transaction in the process transaction file that matches the carrier ID, the transaction is reinitiated and the carrier is processed (<b>1388</b>) normally to its destination. The transaction is noted in the archive as being recovered. Each TCU is then directed to identify (<b>1392</b>) any remaining carriers, one carrier at a time. The above-described steps are repeated until all the staged carriers have been processed (i.e., sent to the MTU recovery station or sent to the intended destination). After all the staged transactions have been processed, the system is available to process transactions normally.</p>
  <p num="p-0091">Another feature which may be incorporated in the system described herein is the means to accurately segregate general use and special use carriers without human intervention. In some systems it is desirable to limit the distribution of biohazards and carriers that had previously transported biohazards. General use carriers may be defined as those carriers that are used to transport only non-biohazard material while special use carriers may be defined as those characters that are used to transport only biohazards. For example, general areas such as pharmacy and administration may use general use carriers while laboratory related areas utilize only the special use carriers. Nursing areas may utilize a mix of general use and special use carriers.</p>
  <p num="p-0092">In order to implement such system, it may be required that the carrier ID be read at each station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, at each TCU <b>14</b> and at the MTU bucket <b>72</b>. Every carrier <b>100</b> must also be equipped with a carrier ID. Prior to start up or implementation of this capability, every carrier <b>100</b> must be identified to the SCC has either general use or special use. Additionally, every carrier must be physically identified as general use or special use. As new carriers are introduced into the system <b>10</b> there should be some maintenance function that allows a carrier to be identified as general use or special use.</p>
  <p num="p-0093">A process (<b>1400</b>) for controlling the routing of general use and special use carriers is described in the flowchart of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. In operation, a carrier <b>100</b> is initially inserted into a dispatcher <b>60</b> of a station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. At this point the carrier ID is read (<b>1404</b>) at the station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> and identified (<b>1408</b>) as either general use or special use. If no carrier ID is read the transaction is not allowed and a message posted at the origin station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> indicating that the carrier <b>100</b> does not include an ID and must be taken out of service (<b>1412</b>). Further, an alarm may also be provided to the SCC (<b>1412</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0094">If the carrier <b>100</b> does have an ID and an empty carrier return function is selected (<b>1416</b>) by a user, the carrier <b>100</b> may be identified as general use or special use. Then a destination may be identified (<b>1420</b>) based on the need for that carrier type at a particular station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. The SCC may then transmit (<b>1424</b>) the carrier to the identified station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0095">If it is determined that the carrier <b>100</b> does include an ID and the empty carrier return function is not selected, a destination may then be received through the user interface <b>32</b> and associated (<b>1428</b>) with the carrier ID. At this point, the SCC <b>30</b> may make the determination (<b>1432</b>) as to whether the destination accepts general use and/or special use carriers. It is possible that a particular destination may accept both types of carriers. If the carrier type is not allowed at the destination chosen, the transaction is disallowed and a message is posted (<b>1436</b>) at the origin station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> which states “destination station does not accept general use/special use carriers.” If the carrier type is allowed at the selected destination station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, the SCC <b>30</b> processed the carrier <b>100</b> normally (<b>1440</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0096">Another process performed by the system described herein is the verification of the successful completion of the transaction without human intervention. Additional capabilities include the SCC <b>30</b> flagging carriers <b>100</b> that did not arrive at their correct destination so that the SCC <b>30</b> will better assist maintenance personnel to ascertain the intended destination of carriers <b>100</b> after a system purge. This particular process also provides documentation and error reporting.</p>
  <p num="p-0097">A flow chart describing the steps performed in the flagging process (<b>1500</b>) is provided in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. The flagging process (<b>1500</b>) will require that the carrier ID be read at the dispatch and destination station, as well as at each TCU <b>14</b> and at the MTU bucket <b>72</b>. Additionally, every carrier <b>100</b> in the system must be equipped with the carrier ID chip <b>29</b>. Still further, the SCC transaction archive <b>33</b> must be modified to include a delivery confirmation field. Possible entries in this field may include: “N/A” indicates carrier ID has not been implemented on the system, “Yes” indicates a delivery of the carrier has been confirmed by validating the carrier ID at the destination station, “No” indicate the carrier ID at the destination station did not match the carrier ID associated with the transaction, and “No Read” indicates the station was unable to determine the carrier ID associated with the transaction delivered to the destination station.</p>
  <p num="p-0098">In operation, a carrier <b>100</b> will initially arrive at a slide plate above a station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> and set a sensor. At this point an attempt is made to read (<b>1504</b>) the carrier ID. A determination is made as to if the carrier ID can be read (<b>1508</b>). If no carrier ID is read after a certain amount of time, the slide plate is directed to open. The destination station will confirm to the SCC <b>30</b> the “No Read” and an alarm warning is posted (<b>1512</b>) at the SCC <b>30</b>. At this point the “No Read” is posted in the transaction delivery confirmation field. If the carrier ID is read, the slide plate is directed to open and the stations <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> provide (<b>1516</b>) the SCC <b>30</b> with the carrier ID. However, in situations where security information is associated with a transaction, this security information may have to be entered at the destination in order for the carrier <b>100</b> to be released.</p>
  <p num="p-0099">At this point the SCC <b>30</b> attempts to verify (<b>1520</b>) the carrier ID with the carrier ID associated with the transaction expected to be at the destination station <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. If the carrier ID's match a “Yes” is posted (<b>1524</b>) in the transaction delivery confirmation field. If the carrier ID's do not match an alarm may be initiated at the SCC <b>30</b>, origin station and/or the destination station. Further, a “No Delivery” is posted (<b>1528</b>) in the transaction delivery confirmation field. At this point the station is then able to receive the next carrier.</p>
