<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
  <p num="p-0003">The present invention relates to an operation method for a fuel cell that generates electricity using hydrogen gas and oxidant gas as reaction gases, and, in particular, to an operation method for a fuel cell that has excellent safety control against hydrogen leakages.</p>
  <p num="p-0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
  <p num="p-0005">One type of fuel cell that is mounted in a fuel cell vehicle or the like is formed as a stack in which a plurality of cells, each formed by interposing between an anode and a cathode a solid polymer electrolytic membrane (formed, for example, from a solid polymer ion exchange membrane or the like) such that the solid polymer electrolytic membrane is sandwiched on both sides by the anode and cathode, are arranged in layers. This fuel cell is provided with a hydrogen pole to which hydrogen gas is supplied as fuel gas, and an air pole to which air containing oxygen is supplied as an oxidant gas. In this fuel cell hydrogen ions generated by a catalytic reaction at the anode move to the cathode by passing through the solid polymer electrolytic membrane, and subsequently cause an electrochemical reaction with oxygen at the cathode so as to generate electricity.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">Because hydrogen gas is an inflammable gas it is necessary to take sufficient care that it does not leak into the atmosphere. Generally, in locations where hydrogen gas is handled, for safety control the hydrogen density is monitored and the necessary steps are taken in accordance with the size of the detected hydrogen density, and fuel cells that use hydrogen gas as fuel are not exceptional. However, because hydrogen is a highly permeating substance it is extremely difficult to seal it in completely. In particular, because the above described solid polymer electrolytic membrane type of fuel cell has a stack structure it is difficult to completely block the hydrogen from leaking out from the fuel cell. Moreover, it is difficult to prevent hydrogen leakages from joint portions such as where connections are formed in the hydrogen piping.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">Therefore, conventionally, a hydrogen sensor that detects the hydrogen density is installed in the vicinity of the fuel cell. When the hydrogen sensor detects a hydrogen density above a predetermined level a warning is issued and the operation of the fuel cell is halted.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">Moreover, as is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 8-31436, there is also a fuel cell that is housed inside a ventilated box. The hydrogen density inside the box is constantly monitored by installing a hydrogen sensor that detects the hydrogen density inside the box. When the hydrogen density detected by the hydrogen sensor exceeds a predetermined level a ventilation fan is operated and ventilation is forcibly performed, thereby reducing the hydrogen density inside the box.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">However, in a system such as the conventional one in which a warning is issued and the system halted when a predetermined hydrogen density is detected by the hydrogen sensor there are times when the system is suddenly halted without any prior warning. In the case of a fuel cell vehicle, if the operation of the fuel cell is suddenly halted like this the problem arises that the vehicle cannot be moved to a location where repairs can be made.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">Moreover, as is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 8-31436, in a system in which a ventilation fan is operated and the interior of the box is forcibly ventilated when a predetermined hydrogen density is detected by the hydrogen sensor, because the amount of hydrogen leakage is not suppressed the fear arises that the amount of hydrogen leakage will subsequently continue to increase.</p>
  <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0011">Therefore, the present invention provides a fuel cell operation method that makes use of the feature that the amount of hydrogen leakage from a fuel cell has a correlation with the operating pressure of the fuel cell (namely, with the reaction gas supply pressure) so that the higher the operating pressure the greater the amount of hydrogen leakage, and that limits the operating pressure such that the amount of hydrogen leakage from the fuel cell does not exceed a predetermined value.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">In order to solve the above problems, one embodiment of the present invention is a fuel cell operation method in which a fuel cell (for example, the fuel cell <b>11</b> in the embodiment described below) that generates power using hydrogen gas and oxidant gas as reaction gas is operated at an operating pressure that corresponds to a required power generation state, wherein a hydrogen sensor (for example, the hydrogen sensor <b>54</b> in the embodiment described below) that detects hydrogen density is provided in a vicinity of the fuel cell and a hydrogen flow passage, and based on values detected by the hydrogen sensor, the operating pressure (for example, the air supply pressure in the embodiment described below) is limited such that a hydrogen leakage amount from the fuel cell and hydrogen flow passage does not exceed a predetermined value (for example, the permissible hydrogen leakage amount Hlim in the embodiment described below).</p>
  <p num="p-0013">When the ventilation amount in the vicinity of a fuel cell is constant, a correlation exists between the amount of hydrogen leaking from the fuel cell and the hydrogen density in the vicinity of the fuel cell. Accordingly, it is possible to estimate the hydrogen leakage amount from the fuel cell based on values detected by a hydrogen sensor. Moreover, the characteristic exists that the hydrogen leakage amount from the fuel cell depends on the operating pressure of the fuel cell (namely, the supply pressure at which reaction gas is supplied), and the higher the operating pressure the greater the hydrogen leakage amount. Accordingly, it is possible to control the operation of the fuel cell by limiting the operating pressure such that the hydrogen leakage amount from the fuel cell does not exceed a predetermined value based on values detected by the hydrogen sensor.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">In another aspect of the present invention, in the above described aspect, based on characteristics of the fuel cell and the hydrogen leakage amount at a current operating pressure, an operating pressure (for example, the permissible operating pressure Plim in the embodiment described below) at which the hydrogen leakage amount will not exceed the predetermined value is predicted, and the operating pressure is limited to less than the predicted operating pressure.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">Because a correlation exists between the amount of hydrogen leaking from the fuel cell and the hydrogen density in the vicinity of the fuel cell when the ventilation amount in the vicinity of a fuel cell is constant, and the amount of the hydrogen leakage from the fuel cell depends on the operating pressure of the fuel cell (namely, on the supply pressure at which reaction gas is supplied), it is possible to predict an operating pressure at which the hydrogen leakage amount is less than the predetermined value from the current operating pressure of the fuel cell and the current hydrogen density detected by the hydrogen sensor, and it is possible to control the operation of the fuel cell by limiting the operating pressure to below the relevant operating pressure. Note that, in each of the above aspects of the present invention, it is possible to provide a hydrogen sensor for detecting hydrogen density not only in the vicinity of the fuel cell, but also on the hydrogen flow path.</p>

Note that the embodiment in this case is applied to a fuel cell mounted in a fuel cell vehicle.</p>
  <p num="p-0024"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic structural view of a fuel cell vehicle.</p>
  <p num="p-0025">The fuel cell vehicle <b>1</b> is provided with a hybrid type of power unit formed by a fuel cell <b>11</b> and a storage apparatus, for example, the capacitor <b>12</b>. The drive force of a traction motor <b>13</b> to which power is supplied from this power unit is transmitted to driving wheels W via a transmission T/M formed either by an automatic transmission or a manual transmission.</p>
  <p num="p-0026">When drive force is transmitted from the driving wheel W side to the traction motor <b>13</b> side as the vehicle is decelerating, the traction motor <b>13</b> functions as a power generator to generate what is known as regenerative braking force, and thereby recover the kinetic energy of the vehicle as electrical energy.</p>
  <p num="p-0027">The fuel cell <b>11</b> is formed as a stack in which a plurality of cells, each formed by interposing between an anode and a cathode a solid polymer electrolytic membrane (formed, for example, from a solid polymer ion exchange membrane or the like) such that the solid polymer electrolytic membrane is sandwiched on both sides by the anode and cathode, are arranged in layers. This fuel cell is provided with a hydrogen pole to which hydrogen gas is supplied as fuel gas, and an air pole to which air containing oxygen is supplied as an oxidant gas. Hydrogen ions generated by a catalytic reaction at the anode move to the cathode by passing through the solid polymer electrolytic membrane, and subsequently cause an electrochemical reaction with oxygen at the cathode so as to generate electricity.</p>
  <p num="p-0028">The air pole of the fuel cell <b>11</b> is provided with an air supply aperture <b>11</b> <i>a </i>through which air is supplied from an air compressor <b>21</b>, which forms an oxidant supply section, and an air discharge aperture <b>11</b> <i>b </i>through which air and the like inside the air pole is discharged to the outside. The hydrogen pole is provided with a hydrogen supply aperture <b>11</b> <i>c </i>through which hydrogen gas is supplied from a hydrogen tank <b>31</b> forming a fuel supply section, and a hydrogen discharge aperture <b>11</b> <i>d </i>through which hydrogen gas and the like inside the hydrogen pole is discharged to the outside.</p>
  <p num="p-0029">The air compressor <b>21</b> takes in air; for example, from outside the vehicle, performs adiabatic compression on this air, and supplies it to the air pole side of the fuel cell <b>11</b> as reaction gas. In addition, it also supplies the air as a pressure signal to a fuel supply control valve <b>32</b> (described below) and to an ejector bypass control valve <b>35</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0030">The air that has been compressed and heated by the air compressor <b>21</b> is able to be supplied to a cooler <b>22</b>, and in accordance with the operating state of the fuel cell <b>11</b>, for example, air that has been cooled by the cooler <b>22</b> to a predetermined temperature may be supplied to a cathode humidifier <b>24</b>, the fuel supply control valve <b>32</b>, and the ejector bypass control valve <b>35</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0031">A cooler bypass flow passage <b>22</b> <i>a </i>that bypasses the cooler <b>22</b> and a cooler bypass control valve <b>23</b> provided, for example, on the downstream side of the cooler <b>22</b> is provided on a flow passage that connects the air compressor <b>21</b> to the cathode humidifier <b>24</b>, the fuel supply control valve <b>32</b>, and the ejector bypass control valve <b>35</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0032">Namely, by closing the cooler bypass control valve <b>23</b> in accordance with the operating state of the fuel cell <b>11</b>, it is possible to supply air that has been compressed and heated by the air compressor <b>21</b> to the fuel cell <b>11</b>, the fuel supply control valve <b>32</b>, and the ejector bypass control valve <b>35</b> without this air being cooled.</p>
  <p num="p-0033">The cathode humidifier <b>24</b> is provided with a water permeable membrane such as, for example, a hollow fiber membrane, and discharged air that is discharged from the air discharge aperture <b>11</b> <i>b </i>of the fuel cell <b>11</b> is used as humidifying gas for the air that is supplied as reaction gas. Namely, if air is made to contact the discharged air via the water permeable membrane, then moisture (in particular, water vapor) contained in the discharged air is supplied to the air as water vapor after permeating through the membrane holes in the water permeable membrane.</p>
  <p num="p-0034">The humidified air is then supplied to the fuel cell <b>11</b> so that the ion conductivity of the solid polymer electrolytic membrane of the fuel cell <b>11</b> is kept in a predetermined state.</p>
  <p num="p-0035">Note that, as has been described below, discharged air that has been discharged from the air discharge aperture <b>11</b> <i>b </i>of the fuel cell <b>11</b> is supplied in sequence to an anode humidifier <b>36</b> and the cathode humidifier <b>24</b> as humidifying gas, while discharged air discharged from the cathode humidifier <b>24</b> is discharged outside the vehicle via a back pressure control valve <b>25</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0036">The opening and closing operation of the back pressure control valve <b>25</b> is controlled by an ECU <b>44</b> in accordance with the operating state of the fuel cell <b>11</b>. By setting the back pressure control valve <b>25</b> to a valve opening degree that conforms to a control signal input from the ECU <b>44</b>, the pressure of the air (air supply pressure) supplied as reaction gas to the inside of the fuel cell <b>11</b> is controlled so as to be at a predetermined pressure. Note that the air supply pressure is controlled so as to increase as the generated current from the fuel cell <b>11</b> increases.</p>
  <p num="p-0037">Hydrogen gas serving as fuel for the fuel cell <b>11</b> is supplied to the fuel supply control valve <b>32</b> from, for example, a high-pressure hydrogen tank <b>31</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0038">The fuel supply control valve <b>32</b> is, for example, a pneumatic type of proportional pressure control valve, and taking the pressure of the air supplied from the air compressor <b>21</b> as a signal pressure, the pressure at the point of exit from the fuel supply control valve <b>32</b> of the hydrogen gas passing through the fuel supply control valve <b>32</b> is controlled so as to be within a predetermined range that corresponds to the signal pressure.</p>
  <p num="p-0039">Hydrogen gas that has passed through the fuel supply control valve <b>32</b> is supplied to a heat exchanger <b>33</b>. In this heat exchanger <b>33</b>, hydrogen gas that has been set to a predetermined temperature in accordance with the operating state of the fuel cell <b>11</b> by, for example, a heat exchange reaction with a cooling material or the like is supplied to the hydrogen pole of the fuel cell <b>11</b> from the hydrogen supply aperture <b>11</b> <i>c </i>via, in this sequence, either an ejector <b>34</b> or the ejector bypass control valve <b>35</b>, and the anode humidifier <b>36</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0040">Further, unreacted discharged gas that has been discharged from the hydrogen discharge aperture <b>11</b> <i>d </i>of the fuel cell <b>11</b> is introduced into the ejector <b>34</b> via a storage tank <b>37</b> and hydrogen gas supplied from the heat exchanger <b>33</b> is mixed together with discharged gas discharged from the fuel cell <b>11</b> and the resultant gas is again supplied to the fuel cell <b>11</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0041">The ejector <b>34</b> suctions in discharged gas from the fuel cell <b>11</b> forming a sub-flow using negative pressure generated in the vicinity of the high-speed hydrogen gas flow flowing through the interior of the ejector <b>34</b>. This discharged gas is then mixed with hydrogen gas supplied via the heat exchanger <b>33</b> and the resultant gas is again supplied to the fuel cell <b>11</b>. As a result, discharged gas discharged from the fuel cell <b>11</b> is recirculated.</p>
  <p num="p-0042">In addition, an ejector bypass flow passage <b>34</b> <i>a </i>that bypasses the ejector <b>34</b> is provided in the flow passage connecting the heat exchanger <b>33</b> with the anode humidifier <b>36</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0043">Here, an ejector bypass control valve <b>35</b> formed, for example, as a pneumatic type of proportional pressure control valve is provided parallel to the ejector <b>34</b> on the ejector bypass flow passage <b>34</b> <i>a</i>. Taking the pressure of air supplied from the air compressor <b>21</b> as signal pressure, the pressure at the point of exit from the ejector bypass control valve <b>35</b> of the hydrogen gas passing through the ejector bypass control valve <b>35</b> namely, the hydrogen supply pressure is controlled so as to be within a predetermined range that corresponds to the signal pressure.</p>
  <p num="p-0044">Namely, taking the pressure of the air serving as oxidant gas as a reference pressure, control of the pressure flow by the fuel supply control valve <b>32</b> and the ejector bypass control valve <b>35</b> is performed such that the pressure flow amount characteristics <b>11</b>) is controlled in accordance with the operating state of the fuel cell <b>11</b>, and this of hydrogen gas passing through the ejector <b>34</b> are in a predetermined state. Moreover, the difference between the pressure of the fuel (i.e., the hydrogen supply pressure) and the pressure of the oxidant (i.e., the air supply pressure) on the solid polymer electrolytic membrane of the fuel cell <b>11</b>, namely, the differential pressure between the fuel pole and the air pole is controlled so as to be within a predetermined pressure difference range.</p>
  <p num="p-0045">Namely, the air supply pressure and the hydrogen supply pressure of the air and hydrogen supplied to the fuel cell <b>11</b> (namely, the operating pressure of the fuel cell <b>11</b>) is controlled in accordance with the operating state of the fuel cell <b>11</b>, and this control is performed such that the operating pressure of the fuel cell <b>11</b> increases as the generated current of the fuel cell <b>11</b> increases.</p>
  <p num="p-0046">The anode humidifier <b>36</b> is provided with a water permeable membrane such as, for example, a hollow fiber membrane, and discharged air that is discharged from the air discharge aperture <b>11</b> <i>b </i>of the fuel cell <b>11</b> is used as humidifying gas for the hydrogen gas. Namely, if hydrogen is made to contact the discharged air via the water permeable membrane, then moisture (in particular, water vapor) contained in the discharged air is supplied to the hydrogen gas as water vapor after permeating through the membrane holes in the water permeable membrane.</p>
  <p num="p-0047">The humidified hydrogen gas is then supplied to the fuel cell <b>11</b> so that the ion conductivity of the solid polymer electrolytic membrane of the fuel cell <b>11</b> is kept in a predetermined state.</p>
  <p num="p-0048">The storage tank <b>37</b>, separates the discharged gas that has been discharged from the hydrogen discharge aperture <b>11</b> <i>b </i>of the fuel cell <b>11</b> into gas and liquid, and separates out and stores the moisture in a liquid state contained in the discharged gas.</p>
  <p num="p-0049">The opening and closing operations of a discharge control valve <b>38</b> are controlled by the ECU <b>44</b> in accordance with the operating state of the fuel cell <b>11</b>, and, for example, excess moisture (mainly liquid water) in the discharged gas separated out in the storage tank <b>37</b> is discharged to the outside of the vehicle.</p>
  <p num="p-0050">Generated current output from the fuel cell <b>11</b> is input into a current controller <b>41</b>. The capacitor <b>12</b> formed, for example, by an electrical double layer condenser or electrolytic condenser serving as a storage device is connected to the current controller <b>41</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0051">Moreover, the fuel cell <b>11</b> and the capacitor <b>12</b> are connected in parallel via the current controller <b>41</b> and an output controller <b>42</b> to the traction motor <b>13</b> (i.e., an electrical load), a motor <b>43</b> that drives the air compressor <b>21</b>, and the like.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">The current controller <b>41</b> is provided with, for example, a DC-DC chopper or the like and, as is described below, based on a target generated current IFC output from the ECU <b>44</b>, namely, on a generation command to the fuel cell <b>11</b>, the current controller <b>41</b> controls the current value of generated current output from the fuel cell <b>11</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0053">The output controller <b>42</b> is provided respectively with PWM converters for the traction motor and the air compressor motor formed, for example, by switching elements such as IGBT or the like. As is described below, based on torque commands to the traction motor <b>13</b> and rotation speed commands to the air compressor <b>21</b> and the like output from the ECU <b>44</b>, the current power output from the fuel cell <b>11</b> and capacitor <b>12</b> via the current controller <b>41</b> is converted into three-phase alternating current power, and is then supplied to the traction motor <b>13</b> and the motor <b>43</b> that drives the air compressor <b>21</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">Note that the traction motor <b>13</b> and the motor <b>43</b> are formed, for example, by permanent magnet type three-phase alternating current synchronous motors that use permanent magnets for the magnetic field, and are controlled so as to be driven by three-phase alternating current power supplied from the output controller <b>42</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0055">The ECU <b>44</b> calculates the remaining capacity of the capacitor <b>12</b> based, for example, on temperature, terminal voltage, and output current output from the capacitor <b>12</b> forming a storage device, and controls the power supply to the loads of the traction motor <b>13</b>, motor <b>43</b>, and the like.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">Further, the ECU <b>44</b> controls the power conversion operations of the PWM inverters installed in the output controller <b>42</b>. For example, the ECU <b>44</b> calculates the desired motor output from the traction motor <b>13</b> based on a signal of the accelerator opening degree AC relating to the amount the accelerator pedal is depressed by the driver and the like. By inputting this motor output command to the output controller <b>42</b> a pulse width modulation signal that corresponds to the motor output command is input into the PWM inverter for the traction motor, and the respective phase current for generating the desired motor output is output to the respective phase of the traction motor <b>13</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0057">The ECU <b>44</b> also calculates the electrical load of the various auxiliary equipment needed to operate the fuel cell <b>11</b> and, based on this electrical load and the motor output required from the traction motor <b>13</b>, calculates a target generated current IFC for the generated current to be output from the fuel cell <b>11</b> into the current controller <b>41</b>, and inputs this into the current controller <b>41</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0058">Furthermore, based on the target generated current, the ECU <b>44</b> calculates, for example, a rotation speed N for the air compressor <b>21</b> as a required value for the flow amount of the reaction gas, and also calculates, for example, a valve opening degree θ for the back pressure control valve <b>25</b> as a required value for the pressure of the reaction gas. As a result of this rotation speed N then being input into the output controller <b>42</b>, the respective phase current that corresponds to the rotation speed N is output to the respective phase of the motor <b>43</b>. Moreover, as a result of the calculated valve opening degree θ being input into the back pressure control valve <b>25</b>, the valve opening degree of the back pressure control valve <b>25</b> is controlled.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">Feedback control of the valve opening degree θ of the back pressure control valve <b>25</b> and the revolution speed N of the air compressor <b>21</b> is also performed such that the respective deviations between the respective required values for the flow amount and pressure of the reaction gas and the flow amount and pressure of the reaction gas that is actually supplied to the fuel cell <b>11</b> are zero.</p>
  <p num="p-0060">As a result, the following signals are input into the ECU <b>44</b>. Namely, detection signals of the accelerator opening degree AC relating, for example, to the amount the accelerator pedal is depressed by the driver that are output from an accelerator opening degree sensor <b>14</b>; signals of flow amount detection values QN that are output from a gas amount sensor <b>46</b> that detects, for example, the flow amount of air (i.e., the mass flow amount) supplied from the air compressor <b>21</b>; and signals of pressure detection values PN that are output from a pressure sensor <b>47</b> that detects, for example, the pressure of air supplied to the air pole side of the fuel cell <b>11</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">Note that the gas amount sensor <b>46</b> is provided in the vicinity of an air discharge aperture <b>21</b> <i>a </i>of the air compressor <b>21</b>, while the pressure sensor <b>47</b> is provided in the vicinity of the air supply aperture <b>11</b> <i>a </i>of the fuel cell <b>11</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0062">Moveover, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in the fuel cell vehicle <b>1</b>, fuel cell and a hydrogen supply system device group <b>50</b> are housed inside a sealed box (referred to below as the FC box) <b>51</b>. Here, the hydogen supply system device group <b>50</b> includes the fuel supply control valve <b>32</b>, the heat converter, the ejecter <b>34</b>, the ejecter bypass control vavle <b>35</b>, the anode humidifier <b>36</b>, and the tubing and the like used to connect all of these.</p>
  <p num="p-0063">The FC box <b>51</b> is provided in order to control hydrogen leakages from the fuel cell <b>11</b>. Therefore, the FC box <b>51</b> has a ventilation intake aperture <b>52</b> and a ventilation outlet aperture <b>53</b> so that ventilation can be performed at a constant flow amount. In addition, a hydrogen sensor <b>54</b> that detects the hydrogen density is provided in the vicinity of the ventilation outlet aperture <b>53</b>. Hydrogen density detection value signals output from the hydrogen sensor <b>54</b> are input into the ECU <b>44</b>. Note that the position where the hydrogen sensor <b>54</b> is installed is not limited to the vicinity of the ventilation outlet aperture <b>53</b>, and the hydrogen sensor <b>54</b> may also be installed at any position inside the FC box <b>51</b> where it is thought that there may be a leaking hydrogen gas flow. For example, it is also possible for the hydrogen sensor <b>54</b> to be installed near the fuel cell <b>11</b>. It is also preferable that the FC box <b>51</b> has a small capacity as this increases the accuracy of the detection of hydrogen leakages.</p>
  <p num="p-0064">Next, the operating control principle of the fuel cell <b>11</b> with regard to hydrogen leakage control in the fuel cell vehicle <b>1</b> will be described.</p>
  <p num="p-0065">As is described above, in a solid polymer electrolytic membrane type of fuel cell <b>11</b> that uses hydrogen gas as a fuel, because hydrogen has a high degree of permeability and because of the stacked structure of the fuel cell <b>11</b>, there are cases in which hydrogen supplied to the fuel cell <b>11</b> permeates the structural members of the fuel cell <b>11</b> (for example, the solid polymer electrolytic membrane and the separators positioned on both sides thereof and the like) and leaks into the FC box <b>51</b>. This is because in a solid polymer electrolytic membrane type of fuel cell <b>11</b>, even if the fuel cell <b>11</b> is brand new with absolutely no defects, there are still cases when an extremely minute amount of leaking hydrogen is observed.</p>
  <p num="p-0066">Accordingly, even if a brand new fuel cell <b>11</b> with no defects is used, if the interior of the FC box <b>51</b> is not ventilated the hydrogen density inside the FC box <b>51</b> continually increases. Therefore, in the present embodiment ventilating air is introduced at a constant flow amount from the ventilation intake aperture <b>52</b> into the FC box <b>51</b> and is discharged from the ventilation outlet aperture <b>53</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0067">When the FC box <b>51</b> is ventilated at a constant flow amount in this way the linear function type relationship shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is established between the amount of the hydrogen leakage from the fuel cell <b>11</b> and the hydrogen density inside the FC box <b>51</b>. Accordingly, based on the hydrogen density inside the FC box <b>51</b> detected by the hydrogen sensor <b>54</b>, the amount of the hydrogen leakage from the fuel cell <b>11</b> and the hydrogen system device group and tubing can be estimated.</p>
  <p num="p-0068">In contrast, as is described above, the fuel cell <b>11</b> operates by changing the operating pressure in accordance with the required generation state (e.g., the required generated current corresponding to the accelerator opening degree) of the fuel cell <b>11</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an example of the relationship between the generated current and the operating pressure of the fuel cell <b>11</b>. It can be seen that the operating pressure is controlled so as to increase as the generated current increases. In addition, a maximum operating pressure Pmax is set for the operating pressure and the operating pressure is controlled so as to be less than this maximum operating pressure Pmax.</p>
  <p num="p-0069">It has been learned through experience that the amount of hydrogen leakage from the fuel cell <b>11</b> and the hydrogen system devices and tubing depends on the operating pressure. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an example of the results of experiments to determine the relationship between the operating pressure of the fuel cell <b>11</b> and the amount of hydrogen leakage. The solid line in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the characteristic of the average hydrogen leakage from a brand new fuel cell <b>11</b> with no defects. Namely, in the case shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the greater the operating pressure, the more the hydrogen leakage amount increases in the manner of a linear function. Moreover, according to experiments, there are cases when the hydrogen leakage characteristic of a particular fuel cell does not match the average hydrogen leakage characteristic of a brand new fuel cell <b>11</b> in spite of the fuel cells having the same specifications. This is due to solid irregularities in the fuel cell <b>11</b> or to the particular fuel cell deteriorating over time. In such cases as well it has been determined that the ratio of an increase/decrease in the hydrogen leakage amount (in other words, the trend in the hydrogen leakage characteristic line shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) relative to an increase/decrease in the operating pressure is the same.</p>
  <p num="p-0070">Note that, to describe it more accurately, the amount of any hydrogen leakage from the fuel cell <b>11</b> depends on the pressure of the hydrogen supply to the fuel cell <b>11</b>, however, as is described above, because in the fuel cell <b>11</b> the hydrogen supply pressure is controlled using the air supply pressure as a reference pressure, it can be said that the amount of the hydrogen leakage from the fuel cell <b>11</b> depends on the pressure of the air supply to the fuel cell <b>11</b>. With no change in the operating pressure of the fuel cell <b>11</b> in either the hydrogen supply pressure or the air supply pressure, the amount of the hydrogen leakage from the fuel cell <b>11</b> depends on the operating pressure.</p>
  <p num="p-0071">However, in the fuel cell <b>11</b> of the present embodiment, because the air supply amount and air supply pressure to the fuel cell <b>11</b> are used as parameters for controlling the generated current, and because the air supply amount is detected by the gas amount sensor <b>46</b> and the air supply pressure is detected by the pressure senor <b>47</b> in order to perform feedback control on these parameters, in the present embodiment, the air supply pressure is used as the operating pressure in the relationship with the hydrogen leakage amount.</p>
  <p num="p-0072">Because of this, in fuel cells <b>11</b> that have the same specifications, if the current hydrogen density Hn inside the FC box <b>51</b> detected by the hydrogen sensor <b>54</b> and the current operating pressure Pn detected by the pressure sensor <b>47</b> are known, then based on the hydrogen leakage characteristic shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is possible to predict the hydrogen leakage amount Hinf when the fuel cell <b>11</b> is operated at the maximum operating pressure Pmax. In addition, it is possible to predict the operating pressure Plim when a predetermined hydrogen leakage amount Hlim is reached. Here, the predetermined hydrogen leakage amount (referred to below as the permissible hydrogen leakage amount) Hlim is set to a value less than the maximum hydrogen leakage amount Hmax, and if control is performed so as to operate the fuel cell <b>11</b> below the operating pressure (referred to below as the permissible operating pressure) Plim corresponding to Hlim, it becomes possible to operate the fuel cell <b>11</b> while suppressing the hydrogen leakage amount from the fuel cell <b>11</b> to a level below the permissible hydrogen leakage amount Hlim.</p>
  <p num="p-0073">Note that because the hydrogen leakage amount is estimated based on the hydrogen density detected by the hydrogen sensor <b>54</b>, the hydrogen leakage amount on the vertical axis in the hydrogen leakage characteristic graph shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> can be replaced with a hydrogen density corresponding to the hydrogen leakage amount. Therefore, in order to simplify the description given below, the vertical axis shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> also shows the hydrogen density.</p>
  <p num="p-0074">Moreover, because the generated current and the operating pressure have a relationship such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it is possible to decide the generated current (referred to below as the permissible generated current) Ilim that corresponds to the permissible operating pressure Plim. Accordingly, instead of controlling the operation of the fuel cell <b>11</b> by limiting the operating pressure to below the permissible operating pressure Plim, it is also possible to control the operation of the fuel cell <b>11</b> by limiting the current output from the fuel cell <b>11</b> to below the permissible generated current Ilim.</p>
  <p num="p-0075">Next, the operation method of the fuel cell in the present embodiment will now be described with reference to the flow chart in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0076">Firstly, the current actual operating pressure Pn detected by the pressure sensor <b>47</b> is read (step S<b>101</b>), and the current actual hydrogen density Hn inside the FC box <b>51</b> detected by the hydrogen sensor <b>54</b> is read (step S<b>102</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0077">Next, based on the hydrogen leakage characteristic of this fuel cell <b>11</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), the predicted hydrogen density Hinf inside the FC box <b>51</b> when the fuel cell <b>11</b> is operating at the maximum operating pressure Pmax is calculated by map reference or by a computer (step S<b>103</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0078">Next, it is determined whether or not the current actual hydrogen density Hn read in step S<b>102</b> is higher than the maximum hydrogen density Hmax (for example 2%) (step S<b>104</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0079">If the result of the determination in step S<b>104</b> is YES (i.e., if Hn&gt;Hmax), a warning lamp is lit (step S<b>105</b>), and a halt system mode is executed (step S<b>106</b>). The execution of the current routine is then temporarily halted. Namely, in this case, because the current hydrogen density inside the FC box <b>51</b> (i.e., the current hydrogen leakage amount from the fuel cell <b>11</b>) already exceeds the maximum hydrogen density (i.e., the maximum hydrogen leakage amount) Hmax, an emergency stop is immediately executed for the fuel cell <b>11</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0080">If, however, the result of the determination in step S<b>104</b> is NO (i.e., if Hn≦Hmax), because it is not necessary to execute an immediate emergency stop for the fuel cell <b>11</b>, the routine moves the step S<b>107</b> where it is determined whether or not the predicted hydrogen density Hinf calculated in step S<b>103</b> is higher than the maximum hydrogen density Hmax.</p>
  <p num="p-0081">If the result of the determination in step S<b>107</b> is NO (i.e., if Hinf≦Hmax), it can be predicted that even when the fuel cell <b>11</b> is operating at the maximum operating pressure Pmax the hydrogen density is not more than the maximum hydrogen density Hmax and, therefore, the routine moves to step S<b>108</b>. In step S<b>108</b>, it is determined whether or not the actual hydrogen density Hn read in step S<b>102</b> is higher than a lower limit hydrogen density Hlow (for example, 0.5%), which is the threshold value of the hydrogen density safety range.</p>
  <p num="p-0082">If the result of the determination in step S<b>108</b> is NO (i.e., if Hn≦Hlow), the current hydrogen density inside the FC box <b>51</b> (i.e., the current hydrogen leakage amount from the fuel cell <b>11</b>) is sufficiently low so as to be within the safety range. Therefore, the routine moves to step S<b>109</b> where an output limit value (i.e., the permissible generated current Ilim) calculated in step S<b>113</b> described below is initialized, and the processing of the current routine is temporarily ended.</p>
  <p num="p-0083">If the result of the determination in step S<b>108</b> is YES (i.e. if Hn&gt;Hlow), the routine moves to step S<b>110</b> in which a warning lamp is lit and the processing of the current routine is temporarily ended. The reason for this is to issue a warning and alert the driver because the current hydrogen density inside the FC box <b>51</b> (i.e., the current hydrogen leakage amount from the fuel cell <b>11</b>) is below the maximum hydrogen density (i.e., the maximum hydrogen leakage amount) Hmax, but is in excess of the lower limit hydrogen density (i.e., the lower limit hydrogen leakage amount) Hlow.</p>
  <p num="p-0084">If, however, the result of the determination in step S<b>107</b> is YES (i.e., if Hinf&gt;Hmax), then although the current hydrogen density inside the FC box <b>51</b> (i.e., the current hydrogen leakage amount from the fuel cell <b>11</b>) is less than or equal to the maximum hydrogen density (i.e., the maximum hydrogen leakage amount) Hmax, because it is predicted that the hydrogen density inside the FC box <b>51</b> (i.e., the current hydrogen leakage amount from the fuel cell <b>11</b>) will exceed the maximum hydrogen density (i.e., the maximum hydrogen leakage amount) Hmax if the fuel cell <b>11</b> is operated at the maximum operating pressure Pmax, operating the fuel cell <b>11</b> at the maximum operating pressure Pmax should be avoided. Therefore, if the result of the determination in step S<b>107</b> is YES, in step S<b>111</b> the warning lamp is turned on. Thereafter, the routine moves to step S<b>112</b> where the permissible operating pressure Plim corresponding to the permissible hydrogen density (i.e., the permissible hydrogen leakage amount) Hlim (for example, 1.9%) is calculated by map reference or by computer. Note that, in the present embodiment, for reasons of safety the permissible hydrogen density (i.e., the permissible hydrogen leakage amount) Hlim is set slightly less than the maximum hydrogen density (i.e., the maximum hydrogen leakage amount) Hmax, however, it is also possible for both to have the same numerical value.</p>
  <p num="p-0085">Next, the permissible generated current Ilim corresponding to the permissible operating pressure Plim is calculated by map reference or by computer (step S<b>113</b>), and limited output operating mode is executed (step S<b>114</b>) using the permissible generated current Ilim as an output restricting value. The processing of the current routine is then temporarily ended. In the limited output operating mode control of the operation of the fuel cell is performed by limiting the current output from the fuel cell <b>11</b> to less than or equal to the permissible generated current Ilim.</p>
  <p num="p-0086"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a block diagram showing an operation control method for the fuel cell <b>11</b> in the fuel cell vehicle <b>1</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0087">In the fuel cell vehicle <b>1</b> the amount the accelerator pedal AP is depressed is detected as an accelerator opening degree by the accelerator sensor opening degree sensor <b>14</b>. Based on this detected accelerator opening degree, the ECU <b>44</b> calculates the motor output required from the traction motor <b>13</b>. In addition, the ECU <b>44</b> calculates the electrical load of various auxiliary equipment (for example, the air compressor <b>21</b> and the like) needed to operate the fuel cell <b>11</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0088">Based on the motor output required from the traction motor <b>13</b> and the electrical load of the auxiliary equipment, the target generated current IFC to be extracted from the fuel cell <b>11</b> by the current controller <b>41</b> is calculated, and based on this target generated current IFC, a target gas amount (i.e., a target air supply amount) and a target pressure (i.e. a target air supply pressure) are calculated.</p>
  <p num="p-0089">Next, based on this target gas amount, a rotation speed N for the air compressor <b>21</b> is calculated and the motor <b>43</b> of the air compressor <b>21</b> is controlled so as to rotate at the calculated rotation speed. In addition, feedback control of the rotation speed of the air compressor <b>21</b> is performed so that there is no difference between the actual gas amount (i.e., the actual air supply amount) detected by the gas amount sensor <b>46</b> and the target gas amount (i.e., the target air supply amount).</p>
  <p num="p-0090">At the same time as this, a valve opening degree θ for the back pressure control valve <b>25</b> is calculated based on the target pressure, and the opening degree of the back pressure control valve <b>25</b> is controlled to become the opening degree θ. In addition, feedback control of the valve opening degree θ of the back pressure control valve <b>25</b> is performed such that there is no difference between the actual air supply pressure detected by the pressure sensor <b>47</b> and the target pressure (i.e., the target air supply pressure).</p>
  <p num="p-0091">Moreover, based on the actual air supply pressure (namely, the actual operating pressure) detected by the pressure sensor <b>47</b> and the actual hydrogen density inside the FC box <b>51</b> detected by the hydrogen sensor <b>54</b>, if necessary, an operating pressure limit value (i.e., a permissible operating pressure) is calculated, and the target pressure is limited to equal to or less than the operating pressure limit value and a warning is also issued. Alternatively, instead of limiting the operating pressure, a generated current limit value (i.e., the permissible generated current) corresponding to the operating pressure limit value is calculated and the target generated current is limited to equal to or less than the generated current limit value (i.e., the broken arrow line in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). By employing a structure in which the target generated current is limited in this way, the current operating pressure can be estimated from the current generated current. Therefore, even if the pressure sensor <b>47</b> suffers a failure or the like, the limited operation of the fuel cell <b>11</b> is still possible. It is even possible to not provide the pressure sensor <b>47</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0092">By performing the control of the operation of the fuel cell <b>11</b> in this way it is possible to alert the driver by turning on a warning lamp if the amount of hydrogen leaking from the fuel cell <b>11</b> increases to a particular amount. If the hydrogen leakage amount from the fuel cell <b>11</b> increases even further so that if the operating pressure increases beyond the current operating state, in which there is no problem, and the fuel cell <b>11</b> is then operated, there is a fear that the hydrogen leakage amount will exceed maximum hydrogen leakage amount. At this time, by operating the fuel cell <b>11</b> while limiting the output from the fuel cell <b>11</b>, it is possible to reliably limit the hydrogen leakage amount such that it does not exceed the maximum hydrogen leakage amount. As a result, it becomes possible to operate the fuel cell vehicle <b>1</b> while predicting the condition of hydrogen leakage from the fuel cell <b>11</b>, and to markedly reduce the probability that the fuel cell <b>11</b> will suddenly make an emergency stop from the present probability. In addition, it becomes possible to move the fuel cell vehicle <b>1</b> to a predetermined location such as a repair shop or the like while performing the operation to limit the output from the fuel cell <b>11</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0093">Furthermore, if the hydrogen leakage amount from the fuel cell <b>11</b> exceeds the maximum hydrogen leakage amount even if the operation to limit the output from the fuel cell <b>11</b> is performed in this way, it is possible to perform an emergency stop of the fuel cell <b>11</b> so as to ensure safety.</p>
  <p num="p-0094">Note that in the above described embodiment the pressure of air supplied to the fuel cell <b>11</b> is taken as the operating pressure to be controlled, however, the operating pressure to be controlled may also be the pressure of hydrogen gas supplied to the fuel cell <b>11</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0095">As has been described above, according to the present invention, because the operating pressure is limited such that the hydrogen leakage amount from the fuel cell and from the hydrogen flow path does not exceed a predetermined value based on values detected by a hydrogen sensor, the excellent effect is achieved that the operation of the fuel cell can be maintained while suppressing the hydrogen leakage amount to less than the predetermined value.</p>
  <p num="p-0096">Moreover, according to the present invention, in addition to the above effect, because an operating pressure at which the hydrogen leakage amount does not exceed the predetermined value is predicted based on characteristics of the fuel cell and the hydrogen leakage amount at the current operating pressure, the limiting of the operating pressure does not come only after it has been detected that the hydrogen leakage amount has exceeded the predetermined value, but because the limited operating pressure is predicted and limited after the fuel cell is already generating a small current and the fuel cell is operated while the operating pressure is in a low state, the excellent effect is achieved that it is possible to reliably limit the hydrogen leakage amount to less than a predetermined value.</p>
