<heading>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading> <p num="p-0002">None.</p>
  <heading>BACKGROUND</heading> <p num="p-0003">After hydrocarbons have been removed from the ground, the fluid stream (e.g., crude oil, natural gas) is transported from place-to-place via pipelines. It is desirable to know with accuracy the amount of fluid flowing in the stream, and particular accuracy is demanded when the fluid is changing hands, or “custody transfer.” Ultrasonic flow meters may be used to measure the amount of fluid flowing in a pipeline, and ultrasonic flow meters have sufficient accuracy to be used in custody transfer.</p>
  <p num="p-0004">The value of gas “changing hands” at the point of custody transfer in a high volume natural gas pipeline may amount to a million dollars or more in a single day. Thus, in some custody transfer situations a single meter body houses two independent ultrasonic flow meters. Two meters enable redundancy in case one meter fails, and in situations where both flow meters are operational, the accuracy of recorded flow volumes may be verified by comparing the two independent measurements. However, having two independent ultrasonic flow meters on the same meter body may create difficulties in operation and/or measurement by the meters.</p>

  <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading> <p num="p-0028">The following discussion is directed to various embodiments of the invention. Although one or more of these embodiments may be preferred, the embodiments disclosed should not be interpreted, or otherwise used, as limiting the scope of the disclosure, including the claims. In addition, one skilled in the art will understand that the following description has broad application, and the discussion of any embodiment is meant only to be exemplary of that embodiment, and not intended to intimate that the scope of the disclosure, including the claims, is limited to that embodiment. Further, the various embodiments were developed in the context of measuring hydrocarbon flows (e.g., crude oil, natural gas), and the description follows from the developmental context; however, the systems and methods described are equally applicable to measurement of any fluid flow (e.g., cryogenic substances, water).</p>
  <p num="p-0029"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a perspective view of flow meter <b>100</b> comprising a sufficient number of transducer pairs that redundant flow measurements can be made. In particular, the meter body or spool piece <b>102</b> is configured for placement between sections of a pipeline, such as by connecting the spool piece <b>102</b> to the pipeline by way of the flanges <b>104</b>. The spool piece <b>102</b> has a predetermined size and defines a central passage <b>106</b> through which measured fluid flows. The flow meter <b>100</b> further comprises a plurality of transducer pairs. In the perspective view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, only one transducer of each of the illustrative eight transducer pairs is visible. In particular, transducer <b>108</b> in housing <b>110</b> is paired with a transducer (not visible) in housing <b>112</b>. Likewise, the remaining transducers in housing <b>110</b> are paired with transducers (not visible) in housing <b>112</b>. Similarly, transducer <b>114</b> in housing <b>116</b> is paired with a transducer (not visible) in housing <b>118</b>. Likewise, the remaining transducers in housing <b>116</b> are paired with transducers (not visible) in housing <b>118</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0030"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an overhead partial cut-away view of the system of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In particular, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows that an illustrative pair of transducers <b>108</b>A and <b>108</b>B is located along the length of spool piece <b>102</b>. Transducers <b>108</b>A and <b>108</b>B are acoustic transceivers, and more particularly ultrasonic transceivers, meaning that they both generate and receive acoustic energy having frequencies of above about 20 kilohertz. The acoustic energy is generated and received by a piezoelectric element in each transducer. To generate an acoustic signal, the piezoelectric element is stimulated electrically by way of a sinusoidal signal, and it responds by vibrating. The vibration of the piezoelectric element generates the acoustic signal that travels through the measured fluid in the central passage <b>106</b> to the corresponding transducer of the transducer pair. Similarly, upon being struck by acoustic energy (i.e., the acoustic signal and other noise signals) the receiving piezoelectric element vibrates and generates an electrical signal that is detected, digitized, and analyzed by electronics associated with the meter.</p>
  <p num="p-0031">A path <b>120</b>, sometimes referred to as a “chord” or a “chordal pathway”, exists between illustrative transducers <b>108</b>A and <b>108</b>B at an angle θ to a centerline <b>122</b>. The length of chord <b>120</b> is the distance between the face of transducer <b>108</b>A and the face of transducer <b>108</b>B. A fluid (e.g., crude oil, natural gas, liquefied natural gas) flows in a direction <b>150</b>. Initially, downstream transducer <b>108</b>B generates an acoustic signal that propagates across the fluid in the spool piece <b>102</b>, and is then incident upon and detected by upstream transducer <b>108</b>A. A short time later (e.g., within a few milliseconds), the upstream transducer <b>108</b>A generates a return acoustic signal that propagates back across the fluid in the spool piece <b>102</b>, and is then incident upon and detected by the downstream transducer <b>108</b>B. Thus, illustrative transducers <b>108</b>A and <b>108</b>B play “pitch and catch” with acoustic signals along chordal path <b>120</b>. During operation, this sequence may occur thousands of times per minute.</p>
  <p num="p-0032">The transit time of the acoustic signal between transducers <b>108</b>A and <b>108</b>B depends in part upon whether the acoustic signal is traveling upstream or downstream with respect to the fluid flow. The transit time for an acoustic signal traveling downstream (i.e., in the same direction as the fluid flow, defined by arrow <b>150</b>) is less than its transit time when traveling upstream (i.e., against the fluid flow, opposite the direction of arrow <b>150</b>). The upstream and downstream transit times can be used to calculate the average flow velocity of the fluid along and/or proximate to the chord, and the transit times can be used to calculate speed of sound in the measured fluid.</p>
  <p num="p-0033">In accordance with the various embodiments, the flow meter <b>100</b> performs two separate and independent flow measurements with transducers on the same spool piece. In particular, four of the illustrative eight transducer pairs are associated with a first flow measurement subsystem, and the remaining four of the illustrative eight transducer pairs are associated with a second flow measurement subsystem. In other embodiments, greater or fewer numbers of transducers pairs may be used by each measurement subsystem, and the number of transducers pairs as between the measurement subsystems need not be the same. Regardless of the number transducer pairs used by each measurement subsystem, when each flow measurement subsystem is in operation the separate flow measurements may be compared and thus used to verify fluid flow through the meter. In cases where one flow measurement subsystem is inoperable (e.g., a transducer pair fails), the second flow measurement subsystem may continue to be used for measuring the fluid flow.</p>
  <p num="p-0034"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an elevational end-view of one end of the flow meter <b>100</b> in relation to a first measurement subsystem. The first flow measurement subsystem of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> comprises four chordal pathways A, B, C and D at varying elevations within the spool piece <b>102</b>. In particular, chord A is an upper-most chord, chord B is an upper-middle chord, chord C is the lower-middle chord, and chord D is the lower-most chord. The elevation designations upper and lower, and the variants, are in reference to gravity. Each chordal pathway A-D corresponds to a transducer pair behaving alternately as a transmitter and receiver. Also shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is meter electronics <b>152</b> that acquire and process the data from the illustrative four chordal pathways A-D (and possibly others). Hidden from view in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, because of the flange, are the four pairs of transducers that correspond to chordal pathways A-D. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows only the elevational orientation of the illustrative four chords of the first measurement subsystem, and does not speak to whether those chords are parallel or co-planar.</p>
  <p num="p-0035"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an overhead view of the flow meter <b>100</b> (with the housings <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> not shown) to illustrate the relationships of the chords of a first measurement subsystem in accordance with at least some embodiments. In particular, a first pair of transducers <b>108</b>A and <b>108</b>B (which corresponds to the upper-most chord, chord A) defines a chordal pathway at a non-perpendicular angle θ to centerline <b>122</b> of spool piece <b>102</b>. Another pair of transducers <b>154</b>A and <b>154</b>B (which corresponds to upper-middle chord, chord B) defines a chordal pathway that loosely forms the shape of an “X” with respect to the chordal pathway of transducers <b>108</b>A and <b>108</b>B, and in some embodiments the chordal pathway for transducers <b>154</b>A and <b>154</b>B is perpendicular to the chordal pathway for transducers <b>108</b>A and <b>108</b>B. Similarly, a third pair of transducer <b>156</b>A and <b>156</b>B (which corresponds to the lower-middle chord, chord C) defines a chordal pathway parallel to the chordal pathway for transducers <b>108</b>A and <b>108</b>B, but lower in the central passage than the chordal pathway for either transducers <b>108</b>A and <b>108</b>B or transducers <b>154</b>A and <b>154</b>B. Not explicitly shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, because of the curvature of the illustrative spool piece <b>102</b>, is a fourth pair of transducers <b>158</b> (transducer <b>158</b>B shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) (which corresponds to the lower-most chord, chord D) defines a chordal pathway parallel to the chordal pathway for transducer ports <b>154</b>A and <b>154</b>B.</p>
  <p num="p-0036">Taking <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> together, for the first illustrative measurement subsystem the pairs of transducers are arranged such that the upper two pairs of transducers corresponding to chords A and B form an the shape of an “X”, and the lower two pairs of transducers corresponding to chords C and D also form the shape of an “X”. Chords A and B are non-planar, chords C and D are non-planar, chords A and C are parallel, and chords B and D are parallel. Other arrangements of the chords are possible, such as all the chords for the measurement subsystem residing in the same vertical plane. The first measurement subsystem determines the velocity of the gas proximate to each chord A-D to obtain chordal flow velocities, and the chordal flow velocities are combined to determine an average flow velocity across the entire central passage. From the average flow velocity and the known cross-sectional area of the central passage, the amount of gas flowing in the spool piece, and thus the pipeline, may be determined by the first measurement system.</p>
  <p num="p-0037">Turning now to the second measurement subsystem, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an elevational end view of one end of the flow meter <b>100</b> in relation to a second measurement subsystem. The flow measurement subsystem of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> comprises four chordal pathways E, F G and H at varying elevations within the spool piece <b>102</b>. In particular, chord E is an upper-most chord, chord F is an upper-middle chord, chord G is the lower-middle chord, and chord H is the lower-most chord. Each chordal path E-H corresponds to a transducer pair behaving alternately as a transmitter and receiver. Also shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is the meter electronics <b>152</b> that acquire and process the data from the illustrative four chordal pathways E-H (and possibly others). Hidden from view in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, because of the flange, are the four pairs of transducers that correspond to chordal pathways E-H. In accordance with at least some embodiments, the chords E-H are at the same elevations as chords A-D, respectively, while in other embodiments some or all of the chords E-H may be at different elevations than chords A-D. Moreover, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows only the elevational orientation of the illustrative four chords of the second measurement subsystem, and does not speak to whether those chords are parallel or co-planar.</p>
  <p num="p-0038"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an overhead view of the flow meter <b>100</b> (with the housings <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> not shown) to illustrate another aspect of the relationship of the chordal pathways used for the second illustrative flow measurement subsystem. In particular, a first pair of transducers <b>114</b>A and <b>114</b>B (which corresponds to the upper-most chord, chord E) defines a chordal pathway at a non-perpendicular angle θ to centerline <b>122</b> of spool piece <b>102</b>. Another pair of transducers <b>160</b>A and <b>160</b>B (which corresponds to upper-middle chord, chord F) defines a chordal pathway that loosely forms the shape of an “X” with respect to the chordal pathway of transducers <b>114</b>A and <b>114</b>B. Similarly, a third pair of transducer <b>162</b>A and <b>162</b>B (which corresponds to the lower-middle chord, chord G) defines a chordal pathway parallel to the chordal pathway for transducers <b>114</b>A and <b>114</b>B, but lower in the central passage than the chordal pathway for either transducers <b>114</b>A and <b>114</b>B or transducers <b>160</b>A and <b>160</b>B. Not explicitly shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, because of the curvature of the illustrative spool piece <b>102</b>, is a fourth pair of transducers <b>164</b> (transducer <b>164</b>A shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) (which corresponds to the lower-most chord, chord H) that defines a chordal pathway parallel to the chordal pathway for transducer ports <b>160</b>A and <b>160</b>B.</p>
  <p num="p-0039">Taking <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> together, for the second illustrative measurement subsystem the pairs of transducers are arranged such that the upper two pairs of transducers corresponding to chords E and F form an the shape of an “X”, and the lower two pairs of transducers corresponding to chords G and H also form the shape of an “X”. Chords E and F are non-planar, chords G and H are non-planar, chords E and G are parallel, and chords F and H are parallel. Other arrangements of the chords are possible, such as all the chords residing in the same vertical plane. The second measurement subsystem determines the velocity of the gas proximate to each chord E-H to obtain chordal flow velocities, and the chordal flow velocities are combined to determine an average flow velocity across the entire central passage. From the average flow velocity and the known cross-sectional area of the central passage, the amount of gas flowing in the spool piece, and thus the pipeline, may be determined by the second measurement subsystem.</p>
  <p num="p-0040"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref> only show transducers associated with the measurement subsystem being described. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an overhead view of the flow meter <b>100</b> (with the housings <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> not shown) to illustrate the relationship of at least some the transducer pairs as between measurement subsystems, and in accordance with at least some embodiments. In particular, the first measurement subsystem comprises transducer pair <b>108</b>A and <b>108</b>B, transducer pair <b>154</b>A and <b>154</b>B, and two other pairs not visible in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The second measurement subsystem comprises transducer pair <b>114</b>A and <b>114</b>B, transducer pair <b>160</b>A and <b>160</b>B, and two other pairs not visible in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Thus, in the embodiments shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the transducer pairs corresponding to the upper-most chords (chord A for the first measurement subsystem and E for the second measurement subsystem), are at the same axial position of the spool piece <b>102</b>. Likewise, the transducer pairs corresponding to the upper-middle chords (chord B for the first measurement subsystem and F for the second measurement subsystem), are at the same axial position of the spool piece <b>102</b>. However, other arrangements are possible, such as the second measurement subsystem being shifted axially along the spool piece <b>102</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0041">The specification now turns to meter electronics. In accordance with some embodiments, each measurement subsystem has a separate and independent set of control electronics. Returning briefly to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, the overall meter electronics <b>152</b> in those figures is illustrated as two separate control electronics <b>152</b>A and <b>152</b>B. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates control electronics <b>152</b>A associated with a single measurement subsystem in accordance with at least some embodiments. It will be understood, however, that in embodiments where each measurement subsystem has a separate and independent set of control electronics, the description in reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is equally applicable to the control electronics for each measurement subsystem. The control electronics <b>152</b>A may reside within an electronics enclosure, which electronics enclosure may couple to the spool piece <b>102</b>. Alternatively, the electronics enclosure that houses the control electronics <b>152</b>A may be equivalently mounted proximate (i.e., within a few feet) of the spool piece. The control electronics <b>152</b>A in these embodiments comprise a processor board <b>200</b> coupled to a data acquisition board <b>202</b>. The data acquisition board <b>202</b>, in turn, couples to the transducers for the measurement subsystem. Having a separate processor board <b>200</b> and data acquisition board <b>202</b> may be based on the data acquisition board <b>202</b> being in a location that requires to board <b>202</b> to be intrinsically safe (i.e., to reduce the likelihood of sparks or other energy igniting flammable gasses), and the processor board <b>202</b> being outside the intrinsically safe area. In other embodiments the functionality of the processor board <b>200</b> and the data acquisition board may be incorporated into a single electronics board.</p>
  <p num="p-0042">On the processor board <b>200</b> resides a processor <b>204</b> coupled to a random access memory (RAM) <b>206</b>, read only memory (ROM) <b>208</b> and multiple communication (COM) ports <b>210</b>A and <b>210</b>B. The processor <b>204</b> is the device within which programs execute to control measurement of fluid flow through the central passage for the particular measurement subsystem. The ROM <b>208</b> is a non-volatile memory which stores operating system programs, as well as programs to implement measuring fluid flow. The RAM <b>206</b> is the working memory for the processor <b>204</b>, and before execution some programs and/or data structures may be copied from the ROM <b>208</b> to the RAM <b>206</b>. In alternative embodiments, programs and data structures may be accessed directly from the ROM <b>208</b>. The communication port <b>210</b>A is the mechanism by which the meter communicates with other devices, such as the control electronics associated with the other measurement subsystems of the flow meter, flow computers (which may accumulate measured flow volumes from a plurality of flow meters) and/or a data acquisition system. While the processor <b>204</b>, RAM <b>206</b>, ROM <b>208</b> and communication ports <b>210</b> are illustrated as individual devices, in alternative embodiments microcontrollers are used, which microcontrollers integrally comprise a processing core, RAM, ROM and communication ports.</p>
  <p num="p-0043">Processor <b>204</b> couples to and controls the data acquisition board <b>204</b> in order to send and receive acoustic signals through the measured fluid. In particular, the processor <b>204</b> couples the data acquisition board through COM port <b>210</b>B. COM port <b>210</b>B may be a separate COM port as illustrated, or the processor board <b>200</b> may use a single COM port <b>210</b> to communicate both to other devices and the data acquisition board <b>202</b>. In some embodiments, the communication protocol between the processor board <b>200</b> and the data acquisition board <b>202</b> is RS-485, but other communication protocols may be equivalently used. By way of the illustrative COM port <b>210</b>B, the processor board <b>200</b> sends commands to the data acquisition board <b>202</b>, such as commands to begin sequential activation of each transducer pair of the measurement subsystem.</p>
  <p num="p-0044">Data acquisition board <b>202</b> comprises a state machine <b>212</b> coupled to a transducer driver <b>214</b>, receiver <b>216</b>, and two multiplexers <b>218</b> and <b>220</b>. The state machine <b>212</b> also couples to the multiplexers <b>218</b> and <b>220</b> by way of control lines <b>222</b> and <b>224</b>, respectively. In accordance with at least some embodiments, the state machine <b>212</b> is a state machine with a plurality of states that activate each transducer pair of the measurement subsystem in a predefined sequence. The state machine <b>212</b> also receives and digitizes acoustic signals incident upon each transducer, and sends the digital representations of the acoustic signals to the processor board <b>200</b>. In some embodiments, the state machine <b>212</b> is implemented as software executing on a processor <b>226</b> (e.g., software stored in ROM <b>228</b> and executed from RAM <b>230</b>), and in other embodiments the state machine <b>212</b> is an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field programmable gate array (FPGA).</p>
  <p num="p-0045">In some embodiments, the transducer driver <b>214</b> comprises an oscillator circuit and an amplifier circuit. In embodiments in which the transducer driver <b>214</b> has an internal oscillator, the transducer driver <b>214</b> creates an initial signal, amplifies the signal to sufficient signal strength to drive a transducer, and provides impedance matching with respect to the transducers. In other embodiments, the transducer driver <b>214</b> receives an alternating current (AC) signal of the desired frequency from the state machine <b>212</b> or other source, amplifies the signal and provides impedance matching with respect to the transducers. The receiver <b>216</b> likewise may take many forms. In some embodiments, the receiver <b>216</b> is an analog-to-digital converter which takes the analog waveform created by a transducer representative of the received acoustic energy, and converts the signal to digital form. In some cases, the receiver <b>216</b> filters and/or amplifies the signals prior to or after digitization. The digitized version of the received signal may then pass to the state machine <b>212</b>, and the digitized version of the received signal is passed to the processor board <b>200</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0046">The state machine <b>212</b> selectively controls the multiplexers <b>218</b> and <b>220</b> to couple each transducer of each transducer pair to the transducer driver <b>214</b> (to drive the transducer to create the acoustic signal) and to the receiver <b>216</b> (to receive the electrical signal created by the transducer in response to the acoustic energy). In some embodiments, the state machine <b>212</b>, within the span of a measurement period (e.g., one second), directs each transducer pair to send approximately 30 upstream acoustic signals and 30 downstream acoustic signals. Greater or fewer sets of upstream and downstream acoustic signals for each transducer pair, and longer or shorter measurement periods, may be equivalently used.</p>
  <p num="p-0047">Still referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and focusing particularly on transducer pair <b>108</b>A and <b>108</b>B as representative of all the transducer pairs. For purposes of this discussion, transducer <b>108</b>A is the sending transducer, and transducer <b>108</b>B is the receiving transducer; however, in actual operation these roles change alternately. Under control of the state machine <b>212</b>, the transducer driver <b>214</b> is coupled, through multiplexers <b>218</b> and <b>220</b>, to the transducer <b>108</b>A. An electrical signal generated and/or amplified by the transducer driver <b>214</b> propagates to and excites a piezoelectric element in transducer <b>108</b>A, and in turn transducer <b>108</b>A generates an acoustic signal. The acoustic signal traverses the distance between transducer <b>108</b>A and transducer <b>108</b>B in the measured fluid. For convenience of the drawing, the transducers <b>108</b>A and <b>108</b>B are not aligned, but in operation the pair would be substantially coaxial, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. During the flight time of the acoustic signal between transducer <b>108</b>A and transducer <b>108</b>B, the state machine <b>212</b> changes the configuration of the multiplexers <b>218</b> and <b>220</b> to couple transducer <b>108</b>B to the receiver <b>216</b>. Transducer <b>108</b>B receives the acoustic energy (i.e., acoustic signal and noise signals), and an electrical signal corresponding to the received acoustic energy propagates to the receiver <b>216</b>. The roles of transmitter and receiver are thereafter reversed, and the process starts anew on the next transducer pair, such as transducers <b>154</b>A and <b>154</b>B.</p>
  <p num="p-0048">In some embodiments, the state machine <b>212</b> also implements a register or counter <b>234</b>. The counter comes into play in embodiments (discussed more below) where activation of transducer pairs is based on predetermined time slots. The counter is periodically updated (e.g., every milli-second), and based on the counter the data acquisition board <b>202</b> activates transducer pairs in respective time slots. While the counter <b>234</b> is shown as part of the state machine <b>212</b>, in other embodiments the counter may be implemented as a register on the data acquisition board <b>212</b> that is periodically updated by the state machine <b>212</b> or other hardware. In embodiments where the state machine <b>212</b> is implemented as software, the counter <b>234</b> may be part of the software, or the counter may be a register of the processor <b>226</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0049">The state machine <b>212</b> sends, to the processor board <b>200</b>, digital representations of the acoustic signals received and indications of when each acoustic signal was launched. In some cases, the indication of when each signal was launched and the digital representation are combined in the same packet-based message. Based on the information provided from the data acquisition board <b>202</b>, the processor <b>204</b> determines an arrival time each received acoustic signal (e.g., a particular zero crossing of the initial movement), and determines a transit time of the acoustic signal. The process of receiving the information and determining transit times for each firing is repeated over each measurement period (e.g., one second) not only for upstream and downstream firings, but also for each chord of the subsystem. Based on the data determined, flow velocities proximate to each chord are calculated by the processor <b>204</b>, an average flow velocity is calculated by the processor <b>204</b>, and based on the spool piece <b>102</b> cross-sectional area a flow volume through the meter for the measurement period is calculated by the processor <b>204</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0050">In some circumstances, the acoustic signals from the first measurement subsystem may interfere with acoustic signals from the second measurement subsystem, causing differences in measured flow. For example, an acoustic signal launched by a first transducer not only propagates across the measured fluid along the chord, but also spreads circularly as the energy travels along the chord, similar to flashlight beam spreading from the focusing mirror. In some cases, because of the width of the beam and the flow of the measured fluid, the acoustic signals launched by a transducer of the first measurement subsystem may impinge upon a transducer of the second measurement subsystem, causing erroneous signals. As another example, while most of the acoustic energy created by a transducer is imparted to the measured fluid, some acoustic energy created by a transducer is coupled to the spool piece <b>102</b>. The speed of propagation of acoustic signals in the metallic structure of the spool piece <b>102</b> is significantly faster, in most cases, than the speed through the measured fluid, and thus parasitic acoustic energy in the spool piece <b>102</b> caused by firing of a transducer of the first measurement subsystem may be received by a transducer of the second measurement subsystem, causing erroneous signals.</p>
  <p num="p-0051">In order to reduce or eliminate interference between the measurement subsystems, flow meters in accordance with the various embodiments coordinate activation of transducers pairs. The coordination may take many forms and varying levels of sophistication. The discussion of coordination by the measurement subsystems begins with illustrative systems for exchanging synchronization signals, and then turns to the illustrative embodiments of synchronization.</p>
  <p num="p-0052"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates control electronics <b>152</b> in accordance with at least some embodiments. In particular, the control electronics <b>152</b> comprise a processor board <b>200</b>A and a data acquisition board <b>202</b>A for a first measurement subsystem, and a processor board <b>200</b>B and a data acquisition board <b>202</b>B for a second measurement subsystem. In the embodiments of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a signal line <b>250</b> couples between the data acquisition boards <b>202</b>, and a synchronization signal is exchanged between the data acquisition boards <b>202</b> across the signal line <b>250</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> also illustrates embodiments where each measurement subsystem comprises a processor board <b>200</b> and a data acquisition board <b>202</b>; however, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> the synchronization signal is exchanged between the measurement subsystems by way of a signal line <b>252</b> coupled between the processor board <b>200</b>A for the first measurement subsystem and the processor board <b>200</b>B for the second measurement subsystem.</p>
  <p num="p-0053"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates embodiments of control electronics <b>152</b> where the first measurement subsystem has a data acquisition board <b>202</b>A, and the second data acquisition board has a data acquisition board <b>202</b>B, but the control electronics <b>152</b> has only one processor board <b>200</b> that couples to and controls both data acquisition boards. Nevertheless, in the embodiments of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> signal line <b>250</b> couples between the data acquisition boards <b>202</b>, and the synchronization signal is exchanged between the data acquisition boards <b>202</b> across the signal line <b>250</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> also illustrates embodiments where each measurement subsystem has a separate data acquisition board <b>202</b>, but where the control electronics <b>152</b> has a single processor board <b>200</b> coupled to each data acquisition board <b>202</b>. However, in the embodiments of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> the synchronization signal is exchanged between the data acquisition boards <b>202</b> through the processor board <b>200</b>, and thus a separate signal line between the data acquisition boards <b>202</b> is not present.</p>
  <p num="p-0054"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates embodiments where each measurement subsystem has its own processor board <b>200</b> and data acquisition board <b>202</b>; however, in the embodiments of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> the synchronization signal exchanged between the data acquisition boards flows through another device. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the synchronization signal flows through a flow computer <b>256</b> coupled to the processor board <b>200</b> of each measurement subsystem, but the synchronization signal may flow through any upstream device, such as a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> also illustrates embodiments where each measurement subsystem comprises processor board <b>200</b> and data acquisition board <b>202</b>; however, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> the processor boards <b>200</b> are coupled by way of a computer network <b>258</b> (e.g., Ethernet Network), and the synchronization signal exchanged between the data acquisition boards flows through the processor boards <b>200</b> and the computer network <b>258</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0055">The specification now turns to illustrative examples of synchronization as between the measurement subsystems. Much like the different physical embodiments for exchange of the synchronization signal, the coordination of activation of transducer pairs as between measurement subsystems may take many forms. For purposes of discussion, the coordination is broken into control by a primary measurement subsystem, and each subsystem firing within predetermined time slots (with time base coordination). Control by a primary measurement subsystem is discussed first.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">In some embodiments one of the measurement subsystems is designated as primary, and the remaining measurement subsystem is designated as secondary. The selection of the primary measurement subsystem may be predetermined, or the measurement subsystems may elect among themselves a primary, such as by random number generation or based on a serial number of each subsystem. Regardless of the precise mechanism by which the primary measurement subsystem is selected, the primary measurement subsystem sends a synchronization signal to the secondary measurement subsystem contemporaneously with each activation of a transducer pair of the primary measurement subsystem. The secondary measurement subsystem receives the synchronization signal, and activates a transducer pair of the secondary measurement subsystem responsive to the synchronization signal. In some embodiments, the coordination between the measurement subsystem results in only a single transducer pair being activated at any one time on the flow meter <b>100</b>. In other embodiments, the coordination may involve having only one transducer launching an acoustic signal at any one time, but launching of one acoustic signal may take place while another acoustic signal is in flight. In yet still other embodiments, the coordination may involve simultaneous firings, but for transducers at different elevations such that interference is not an issue.</p>
  <p num="p-0057"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates a timing diagram in accordance with at least some embodiments using a primary/secondary system. In particular, the primary measurement subsystem activates a transducer pair (in this case, launches an acoustic signal by one transducer), as illustrated by block <b>1500</b>. Contemporaneously with the activation, the first measurement subsystem sends a synchronization signal, as illustrated by block <b>1502</b>. Sending of the synchronization signal may be by way of any of the mechanisms described above. The second measurement subsystem receives the synchronization signal and activates a transducer pair (in this case, launches an acoustic signal) a predetermined amount of time after receipt of the synchronization signal, as illustrated by time span <b>1504</b> and block <b>1506</b>. In the illustrative case of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the predetermined delay is set such that launching of the acoustic signal of the transducer of the second measurement subsystem is during the flight time of the acoustic signal launched by the first measurement subsystem, as illustrated by the receiving of the acoustic signal for the first measurement subsystem at block <b>1508</b>. Some time later, the acoustic signal launched by the second measurement subsystem is received, as illustrated by block <b>1510</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0058">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, in other embodiments the primary measurement subsystem sends the synchronization to more directly control the activation of transducer pairs in the secondary measurement subsystem. In particular, the primary measurement subsystem activates a transducer pair (in this case, launches an acoustic signal) as illustrated by block <b>1600</b>. Contemporaneously with activation (in particular, between launching and receiving of the acoustic signals), and at the point in time when the primary measurement subsystem desires the secondary measurement subsystem to activate a transducer pair, the primary measurement subsystem sends the synchronization signal. In the case of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the synchronization signal is sent during the flight time of the acoustic signal from the transducer of the first measurement subsystem, as illustrated by block <b>1602</b>. Sending of the synchronization signal may be by way of any of the mechanisms described above. Based on the command from the primary measurement subsystem, the secondary measurement subsystem immediately activates a transducer pair (in this case launches an acoustic signal), as illustrated by block <b>1604</b>. Thereafter, the acoustic signal launched by the first measurement subsystem is received (block <b>1606</b>), and then the acoustic signal launched by the second measurement subsystem is received (block <b>1608</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0059">In the embodiments of the synchronization described to this point, very little information need be carried by the synchronization signal. In particular, the synchronization signal may be a single Boolean value, and thus signal lines (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 11</figref>) may be a single wire (with a common ground), or perhaps a two-conductor twisted pair cable. Moreover, if the synchronization signal is delivered through a single or multiple processor boards (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 12</figref>), again the synchronization signal may be a single Boolean value. In embodiments where the synchronization signal is part of a packet-based message (e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> or <b>14</b>), then the data payload of the message may carry the Boolean value, or the mere fact a message was (regardless of payload, if any) received may represent a synchronization signal.</p>
  <p num="p-0060">In the embodiments discussed so far, while the primary measurement subsystem may control timing of the activation of transducer pairs in the secondary measurement subsystem, the primary measurement subsystem does not control which transducer pair of the secondary measurement subsystem is activated. In alternative embodiments, the primary measurement subsystem not only controls the timing, but also which transducer pair the secondary measurement subsystem is to activate. In embodiments where the primary measurement subsystem controls which transducer or transducer pair to activate, the synchronization signal may be more than a single Boolean value, and in fact may comprise a plurality of values to identify which particular transducer or transducer pair to activate (e.g., transducer A<b>1</b> could be associated with a value 000, transducer A<b>2</b> could be associated with value 001, and so forth). The plurality of Boolean values may be encoded on the signal lines (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 11</figref>). Moreover, if the synchronization signal is delivered through a single or multiple processor boards (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 12</figref>), again the synchronization signal may be a plurality of Boolean values encoded on the signal lines. In embodiments where the synchronization signal is part of a packet-based message (e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> or <b>14</b>), then the data payload of the message may carry the plurality of Boolean values identifying the transducer pair to activate.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">The discussion now turns to synchronization based on activation of transducer pairs within predetermined time slots. In particular, in the time slot embodiments each data acquisition board <b>202</b> implements a counter <b>234</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) that is the basis for time determinations. Each transducer or transducer pair is activated based on predetermined time slots ascertained by the time base held in the counter <b>234</b>. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates a timing diagram for embodiments that fire the transducers based on time slots. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates eight time slots (designated slot <b>1</b> through slot <b>8</b>). Within the first time slot, the first measurement subsystem (having illustratively labeled chords A, B, C and D) launches and receives an acoustic signal along chord A defined by a transducer pair (indicated as A<b>1</b>, block <b>1700</b>), and likewise the second measurement subsystem (having illustratively labeled chord E, F, G and H) launches and receives an acoustic signal along chord E defined by a transducer pair (indicated as E<b>1</b>, block <b>1702</b>). Thus, time slot one (or any of the time slots for that matter) are similar to the coordination between measurement subsystems shown with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> or <b>16</b>, except that no synchronization signal is exchanged to specifically identify the activation of the second measurement subsystem. In the next illustrative time slot, time slot two, the first measurement subsystem launches and receives an acoustic signal in the opposite direction along chord A (indicated as A<b>2</b>, block <b>1704</b>), and likewise the second measurement subsystem launches and receives an acoustic signal in the opposite direction along chord E (indicated as E<b>2</b>, block <b>1706</b>). The process continues in each time slot and for each transducer pair, ending in time slot eight of illustrative <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> with launching an acoustic signal along chord D (indicated as D<b>2</b>, block <b>1708</b>) and along chord H (indicated as H<b>2</b>, block <b>1710</b>). The timing diagram of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is merely illustrative, and any pattern of activating the transducers within the time slots may be equivalently used.</p>
  <p num="p-0062">In the various embodiments based on the time slots, while each data acquisition board <b>202</b> has its own counter <b>234</b>, even if the counters <b>234</b> start at the same value at power-up, slight differences in clock frequency may result in misalignment of the time slots as between the measurement subsystems. In order to address such a concern, the embodiments that utilize time slots periodically exchange a synchronization signal. Rather than directly indicating the activation of transducers, the synchronization signal in these embodiments aligns or substantially aligns the counters <b>234</b>. For example, upon receipt of the synchronization signal, a data acquisition board <b>234</b> may set the counter to a predetermined value (e.g., zero). In embodiments where the synchronization signal triggers the counters to a predetermined value, the synchronization signal may be a Boolean value delivered as discussed above, or the signal may be the merely receipt of a synchronization signal as a packet-based message.</p>
  <p num="p-0063">In other embodiments, the synchronization signal itself carries an indication of the value to which each counter should be set. For example, the synchronization signal sent along illustrative signal line <b>250</b> could comprise a series of Boolean values that directly or indirectly indicate the value to be placed in the counter. In other embodiments, the value to be placed in the counter could be carried as payload in a synchronization signal in the form of a packet-based message.</p>
  <p num="p-0064">In the embodiments implemented using time slots, the counters need only be periodically synchronized, with the period set by the accuracy of the clock system associated with the counters. If the clock systems on each data acquisition board stay sufficiently aligned for extended periods of time, then the synchronization signal need only be exchanged every week or every few days. On the other hand, if differences develop quickly between the counters, then a synchronization signal may be exchanged every few hours or few minutes. However, in the various embodiments the clock systems associated with the counters are sufficiently accurate that once aligned a synchronization signal need not be sent more often than a measurement period (e.g., one second). The synchronization signalizes between the measurements subsystems may be sourced by one of the measurement subsystems, or the synchronization signal may come from other sources, such a flow computer or SCADA system coupled to the flow meter.</p>
  <p num="p-0065"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates a method in accordance with at least some embodiments. In particular, the method starts (block <b>1800</b>), and proceeds to operating a first measurement subsystem of a flow meter, the first measurement subsystem comprising a first plurality of transducer pairs coupled to a spool piece (block <b>1804</b>). The method also comprises operating a second measurement subsystem of the flow meter, the second measurement subsystem comprising a second plurality of transducer pairs coupled to the spool piece (block <b>1808</b>). Finally, the method comprises coordinating activation of transducer pairs between the first and second measurement subsystems (block <b>1812</b>), and the method ends (block <b>1816</b>).</p>
