<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="P-00003">1. The Field of the Invention</p>
  <p num="P-00004">The present invention is related to a utility table, and more particularly, to a portable folding utility table having one or more center support assemblies and off-set support legs that selectively support the utility table above a surface.</p>
  <p num="P-00005">2. The Relevant Technology</p>
  <p num="P-00006">Portable folding utility tables are indispensable for groups or organizations that have limited floor space usable for multiple purposes. For example, foldable utility tables can be placed in a pre-determined configuration to meet the space requirements of a school gymnasium, a church multi-purpose room, or a hotel conference meeting room. Afterward, the tables can be neatly stored away and the conference or meeting room used for a different purpose. Thus, portable folding utility tables allow a group or organization to maximize the efficiency and utility of a particular space.</p>
  <p num="P-00007">Foldable utility tables can also provide an immediate temporary work space in a garage, tool shed, and the like. The portability and foldability of these utility tables allows a user to conveniently set up, take down, and store the table whenever and wherever the user chooses.</p>
  <p num="P-00008">A major drawback with many portable folding utility tables of the prior art, however, is their inherent size and bulkiness. Many such utility tables require two people to collapse and store the table after use. Moreover, some prior art portable folding utility tables are heavy enough to cause injury if dropped or mishandled. These unwieldy tables are usually made from hardwood, particle board, or similarly heavy materials. In an attempt to overcome this weight and bulkiness problem, some prior art portable utility tables are formed of lighter-weight materials. However, many of these light-weight utility tables generally lack the sturdiness of the heavier-weight prior art utility tables.</p>
  <p num="P-00009">Another disadvantage to prior art utility tables is the means used for attaching the table support legs or two or more support pedestals to the underside of the table. As will be appreciated, prior art table support legs are typically attached to the table top using threaded screws or bolts that are drilled into the underside of the table top. This means of attachment may include a form of bonding the table support legs as support pedestals directly against the surface of the table top. Often, however, this means of attachment by bonding weakens the structural integrity of the table top. Thus, when the table support legs fail, a portion of the material forming the table top may pull away at the point of the bonded attachment thereby making the table costly, if not impossible to repair.</p>
  <p num="P-00010">In an attempt to overcome the foregoing disadvantages, prior art utility tables were developed by those skilled in the art that are equipped with complex or heavy-duty attachment mechanisms that facilitate a secure attachment between the table support legs or the support pedestals and the table top. These types of attachment mechanisms, however, are normally heavier, more costly, more difficult to install, and typically require additional time to manufacture.</p>
  <p num="P-00011">The previously stated disadvantages are compounded by the fact that many prior art utility tables incorporate a separate and distinct attachment mechanism for attaching each table support leg or pedestal to the table top. As appreciated, most existing portable folding utility tables have two sets of support legs or pedestal supports, one at each end of the table. Each of these supports is typically attached to the underside of the table top at two places or points of contact. Correspondingly, many of these types of utility tables have at least four separate points of attachment, each attachment between the support legs or pedestal supports facilitated by a separate attachment mechanism. One particular problem with utility tables having separate and distinct attachment mechanisms is that they are generally susceptible to bowing in the center of the table top under stress. This is especially true with larger banquet-style tables.</p>
  <p num="P-00012">Yet another drawback with many prior art utility tables is that the hard materials used to maintain a sufficient rigidity and sturdiness of the table top often have sharp edges that may be uncomfortable for the user to lean against or rest their arms upon. Further, these materials may also be susceptible to damage or degradation from the elements of nature.</p>
  <p num="P-00013">In addition, smaller utility tables that are found in the prior art usually comprise shortened support legs that fail to provide sufficient height to the table top in relation to the underlying surface, thus these types of table are generally uncomfortable to users. In particular, when these prior art utility tables are configured in the folded position for storage, the table support legs are required to be short enough so not to interfere with each other when folded in a conventional fashion underneath the table top. Small folding utility tables of the prior art are also typically bulky when disposed in the folded position because complex and unwieldy mechanisms are generally required to accommodate the use of longer support legs that may be incorporated to overcome the inherent height deficit found in most smaller utility tables.</p>
  <p num="P-00014">From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that it would be an advancement in the art to provide a portable folding utility table that is durable enough to withstand the increased wear and tear that portable utility tables are subjected to over long periods of time and sturdy enough to support varying sized loads that will be placed on the table, while at the same time being light-weight enough to be easily set up and taken down.</p>
  <p num="P-00015">It would be another advancement in the art to provide a portable folding utility table having a leg or support pedestal attachment mechanism that does not involve a complex design, heavy-duty attachment hardware, or need to be screwed, bolted, or bonded to the under side of the table top. It would be a further advancement in the art to provide a portable folding utility table that minimizes the points of attachment to the surface of the table top and facilitates attachment mechanisms that interrelate with each other to support the table top above an underlying surface.</p>
  <p num="P-00016">Furthermore, it would be an advancement in the art to provide a portable folding utility table that may provide a smaller working surface than larger utility table, but that is comfortable to work at in relation to its height disposition and which is capable of withstanding the elements of nature.</p>
  <p num="P-00017">Finally, it would be an advancement in the art to provide a portable folding utility which the support legs or pedestals, having a length greater than the corresponding of the table top, can fold against the underside of the table top when disposed for without interfering with each other, so that smaller frames and table tops can be used commodate a sufficient height disposition in relation to the underlying support</p>
  <p num="P-00018">Such a portable folding utility table is disclosed and claimed herein.</p>
  <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="P-00019">The present invention is directed to a novel portable folding utility table having a center support assembly. The utility table includes a table top supported by a pair of support pedestals. In one presently preferred embodiment, the table top includes a mounting surface and a working surface formed opposite the mounting surface. The working surface may be textured and may include an outer periphery, at least a portion of which is beveled to provide comfort to a user.</p>
  <p num="P-00020">A first end of each support pedestal is preferably attached to the mounting surface of the table top. In one presently preferred embodiment, the support pedestals are pivotally attached to the mounting surface of the table top, to allow each support pedestal to be moved between a collapsed position and an extended position for supporting the table top above a surface. A securing member may also be attached to the mounting surface for releasably securing one or more support pedestals in the collapsed position.</p>
  <p num="P-00021">Additionally the utility table may include a first pivoting support brace attached to the first support pedestal at a proximal end and to the mounting surface at a distal end thereof. Similarly, a second pivoting support brace may be attached to the second support pedestal at a proximal end and to the mounting surface at a distal end thereof. In one presently preferred embodiment of the present invention, the distal ends of the first and second pivotal support braces are disposed contiguous to each other at a retention assembly attached to the mounting surface or, in the alternative, to a support frame.</p>
  <p num="P-00022">In one presently preferred embodiment of the present invention, the retention assembly may include a single cross-brace member disposed through openings formed at the distal ends of the pivotal support braces and secured to the mounting surface. The mounting surface may be configured such that opposing ends of the cross-brace member are introduced through openings disposed in opposing sides of the mounting surface of the table top and may further include a mount for receiving and retaining the cross-brace member therein. Thus, the distal ends of both support pedestals are preferably attached along the length of the cross-brace member which is secured to the mounting surface, thereby reducing the number of attachment mechanisms and interrelating the support pedestals to the table top to increase structural support and efficiency of manufacture.</p>
  <p num="P-00023">In another presently preferred embodiment, each support pedestal includes a first member pivotally engaging the mounting surface of the table top and a second member configured for telescoping engagement with the first member. This configuration permits the height of the support pedestal to be disposed between a lengthened position and a retracted position.</p>
  <p num="P-00024">In an alternative presently preferred embodiment, the table may include two cross-brace members providing separate attachment points for the first and second pivotal support braces. Such a configuration is particularly desirable for tables having an extended length, in which it may not be advantageous for each of the pivotal support braces to have lengths sufficient for extending into the center of the table top. Correspondingly, a dual cross-brace configuration may provide additional space for accommodating one or more user's legs under the table top.</p>
  <p num="P-00025">Moreover, in yet another presently preferred embodiment of the present invention, each support pedestal may include two legs slightly offset from the corresponding legs of the other support pedestal disposed on the opposing side of the table top, so that longer support legs can be accommodated under a smaller table top when disposed above an underlying surface. This off-set distance is sufficient to keep the support legs of the opposing support pedestal from interfering with one another, thus allowing displacement substantially against the mounting surface of the table top when disposed in the retracted position for storage.</p>
  <p num="P-00026">From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that the present invention provides a portable folding utility table that is durable enough to withstand increased wear and tear yet is light-weight for easy set up and take down The present invention also provides a novel center support assembly that provides increased structural stability to the table top with efficient design such that to allow the interrelation of the support pedestals. The center support assembly is also cost effective to manufacture and does not compromise the structural integrity of the table top. Further, the present invention provides a utility table that facilitates a height that is comfortable for one or more users to work at. The foregoing and other advantages and features of the present invention will become more fully apparent by examination of the following description of the presently preferred embodiments and appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

  <p num="P-00039">In one presently preferred embodiment, the mounting surface <b>14</b> of the table top <b>12</b> comprises opposing longitudinal interior side walls <b>48</b> and opposing orthogonal interior side walls <b>52</b> disposed along an interior periphery of the table top <b>12</b>. The first and second side rails <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> may be secured to respective opposing longitudinal side walls <b>48</b>, thus adding rigidity and strength to the structural integrity of table top <b>12</b>. In one presently preferred embodiment, the side rails <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> are secured to the opposing longitudinal side walls <b>48</b> by fasteners. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the side rails <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> may be secured to the opposing longitudinal side walls <b>48</b> of the mounting surface <b>14</b> using any number or variety of fasteners readily known in the art, such as, for example, screws, bolts, rivets, adhesives, or the like.</p>
  <p num="P-00040">The cross-section of the side rails <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> may be configured having an S-shape. In one presently preferred embodiment, the side rails <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> may be attached to the respective longitudinal side walls <b>48</b> so as to form respective channels <b>50</b> along the side rails <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> between the side rails <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> and the longitudinal side walls <b>48</b> (See FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>). In this configuration, the first end <b>22</b> of the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> may be positioned within opposing respective retaining apertures <b>46</b> formed in the side rails <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> abutting the longitudinal side walls <b>48</b> within the channels <b>50</b>, thereby substantially preventing lateral movement of the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> relative to the table top <b>12</b>.

  <p num="P-00041">Still referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the frame <b>40</b> may also comprise a first end rail <b>54</b> and an opposing second end rail <b>56</b>. Preferably, the first end rail <b>54</b> is disposed substantially parallel to the opposing end rail <b>56</b>. Each end rail <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> has a first end <b>58</b> and a second end <b>60</b> and is preferably positioned along the opposing orthogonal interior side walls <b>52</b> of the mounting surface <b>14</b> of the table top <b>12</b> In one presently preferred embodiment, the first end <b>58</b> of each end rail <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> is disposed within the channel <b>50</b> adjacent respective ends <b>62</b> <i>a</i>, <b>62</b> <i>b </i>of the first side rail <b>42</b>.

It will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art that, in this configuration, the tab members <b>66</b> act as levers with the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> (positioned within the channels <b>50</b> near the ends <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> of the respective side rails <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>), thus acting as corresponding fulcrums. In this manner, the end rails <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> strengthen respective ends <b>68</b> <i>a</i>, <b>68</b> <i>b </i>of the table top <b>12</b>, and protect against bowing of the table top <b>12</b> at the ends <b>68</b> <i>a</i>, <b>68</b> <i>b</i>. The first and second side rails <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> in combination with the first and second end rails <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> provide a means for structurally supporting the table top <b>12</b>, the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, and the pivotal support braces <b>24</b>, <b>30</b>. In this configuration, lighter weight table tops <b>12</b> may be used with this novel construction without losing rigidity or structural integrity.</p>
  <p num="P-00043">As will be appreciated, the end rails <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> may interrelate to the side rails <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> in a variety of ways to provide structural support for the utility table <b>10</b> and help protect against bowing under various loads that may be applied to the utility table <b>10</b>. For example, the end rails <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> may be welded to the side rails <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>. The end rails <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> may also be bonded to the side rails <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> using a variety of suitable epoxies or resins. Further, the end rails <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> and the side rails <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> may be formed as a single unitary piece configured to the desired size and shape. Moreover, it will be also appreciated that the end rails <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> and the side rails <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> need not interrelate at all, but could simply be attached to the respective a interior opposing side walls <b>48</b>, <b>52</b> of the mounting surface <b>14</b> of the table top <b>12</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00044">In one presently preferred embodiment of the present invention, the frame <b>40</b> is formed of a substantially sturdy, rigid material sufficient to provide structural integrity to the table top <b>12</b>. For example, the frame <b>40</b> may be formed of metal. However, it will be readily appreciated that the frame may be formed of a wide variety of other suitable materials that are consistent with the spirit and scope of the present invention. It will further be appreciated that the size and configuration of the frame <b>40</b> will depend, in part, on the size and configuration of the table top <b>12</b>. Accordingly, the table top <b>12</b> and the frame <b>40</b> may be configured in a variety of shapes and configurations, including, but not limited to, a circle, polygon, square, rectangle, triangle, or any other suitable geometrical configuration.</p>
  <p num="P-00045">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the shape and size of the frame <b>40</b> is configured to generally conform to the periphery of the mounting surface <b>14</b> of the table top <b>12</b>.

As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, a variety of other suitable means or methods for attaching the frame <b>40</b> to the mounting surface <b>14</b> of the table top <b>12</b> may be employed, including, but not limited to, rivets, screws, bolts, glues, epoxies, or other bonding materials.</p>
  <p num="P-00046">As can be best seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the mounting surface <b>14</b> of the table top <b>12</b> is preferably configured to facilitate the attachment of the frame <b>40</b> to the mounting surface of the table top <b>12</b>. In one presently preferred embodiment, the mounting surface <b>14</b> is configured with seats (not shown) positioned such that the end rails <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> may be positioned between respective opposing orthogonal interior walls <b>52</b> and the seats (not shown). In this configuration, the end rails <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> are substantially prevented from bowing inwardly toward the center of the utility table <b>10</b> under loads exerted upon the opposing ends of the table top.</p>
  <p num="P-00047">It will be readily appreciated that the mounting surface <b>14</b> need not have interior side walls <b>48</b>, <b>52</b> at all to practice the teachings of the present invention. In this regard, the teachings of the present invention may be practiced without a frame <b>40</b> if the table top <b>12</b> is sufficiently rigid. It will further be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the embodiments where there is <b>110</b> frame, the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> and cross brace member <b>36</b> may be attached to an interior portion of the mounting surface <b>14</b>. Further, in preferred embodiments where there are interior side walls <b>48</b>, <b>52</b> but no frame <b>40</b>, the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> and cross brace member <b>36</b> may be positioned directly in retaining apertures (not shown) formed within the interior side walls <b>48</b>, <b>52</b> of the mounting structure <b>14</b> of the table top <b>12</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00048">Referring back to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are pivotally attached to the mounting surface <b>14</b>, thereby permitting each of the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> to be moved between a collapsed position, in which each support pedestal <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> lies flat in substantially the same plane as the table top <b>12</b>, and an extended position, in which each support pedestal <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> is folded outward, substantially perpendicular to the plane of the table top <b>12</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00049">Each support pedestal <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> may include a pair of substantially parallel posts <b>80</b>. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the teachings of the present invention can be practiced if each support pedestal <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> has more or less than two posts <b>80</b>. Each pair of posts <b>80</b> comprises a first end <b>82</b> and a second opposing end <b>84</b>. In one presently preferred embodiment, the first end <b>82</b> of each respective pair of posts <b>80</b> is secured to a cross pole <b>86</b>. Respective ends <b>88</b> of each cross pole <b>86</b> are preferably positioned within opposing retaining apertures <b>46</b> disposed within the opposing side rails <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> of the frame <b>40</b> such that the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> may be disposed substantially parallel to each other. In this configuration, each cross pole <b>86</b> rotates within respective pairs of retaining apertures <b>46</b> when respective pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> move between the collapsed position and the extended position. In one presently preferred embodiment, a stabilizer arm <b>90</b> is preferably disposed between the respective pairs of posts <b>80</b> to assist in structurally maintaining the spaced-apart relationship of the posts <b>80</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00050">It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> may be configured in a variety of ways such that to practice the teachings of the present invention. For example, the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> may comprise a solid or integral piece or the posts <b>80</b> may be curved in a different manner (e.g., see, FIG. <b>3</b>). It will further be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> need not be in pivotal engagement with the table top <b>12</b> to be collapsible. For example, the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> may simply be detachably engaged in relation to the table top <b>12</b> such that when it is desired to collapse the utility table <b>10</b> for storage, the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are removed from selective engagement with the table top <b>12</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00051">As stated above, the first and second support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are preferably connected to the table top <b>12</b> by means of the first and second pivotal support braces <b>24</b>, <b>30</b>, respectively. In one presently preferred embodiment of the present invention, the proximal ends <b>26</b>, <b>32</b> of the respective pivotal support braces <b>24</b>,<b>30</b> are bifurcated to facilitate pivotal engagement with the posts <b>80</b> of the respective support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b>. The bifurcated proximal ends of the pivotal support braces <b>24</b>, <b>30</b> each preferably comprise a pair of angled members <b>100</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00052">Referring specifically to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the angled members <b>100</b> may include a tab member <b>102</b> which pivotally engages and partially overlaps a corresponding tab member <b>104</b> adjacent each of the distal ends <b>28</b>, <b>34</b> of the pivotal support braces <b>24</b>, <b>30</b>, respectively, at an overlapping portion <b>106</b>. When the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are in the extended position, the tabs <b>102</b> of the angled members <b>100</b> of the bifurcated proximal ends <b>26</b>, <b>32</b> are disposed substantially parallel to the tabs <b>104</b> adjacent each distal end <b>28</b>, <b>34</b> of the pivotal support braces <b>24</b>, <b>30</b>. When the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are in the collapsed position, the tabs <b>102</b> of the angled members <b>100</b> of the bifurcated proximal ends <b>26</b>, <b>32</b> are disposed substantially unparallel to the tabs <b>104</b> adjacent each distal end <b>28</b>, <b>34</b> of the pivotal support braces <b>24</b>, <b>30</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00053">The utility table <b>10</b> may include a pair of locking collars <b>108</b> which slidably engage respective pivotal support braces <b>24</b>, <b>30</b>.

With the locking collars <b>108</b> positioned over respective overlapping portions <b>106</b>, the bifurcated proximal ends <b>26</b>, <b>32</b> are prevented from moving relative to corresponding distal ends <b>28</b>, <b>34</b> of the pivotal support braces <b>24</b>, <b>30</b>, thus preventing the support pedestal supports <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> from being positioned in the collapsed position without first disengaging the locking collars <b>108</b>, respectively.</p>
  <p num="P-00054">It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that with the utility table <b>10</b> in an upright position and the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> in the extended position, the collars <b>108</b> may, under the force of gravity, position themselves about the overlapping portions <b>106</b>. It will be further appreciated that a variety of other locking mechanisms as assemblies may be utilized to lock the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> in the extended position that are consistent with the spirit and scope of the present invention, including latches or other fasteners.</p>
  <p num="P-00055">With reference now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the utility table <b>10</b> is shown having an alternative configuration of the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. In this alternate embodiment, each support pedestal <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> comprises a first member <b>114</b> pivotally engaged to the mounting surface <b>14</b> of the table top <b>12</b> and a second member <b>116</b> configured for telescoping engagement with the first member <b>114</b>, thereby permitting the height of each support pedestal <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> to be selectively disposed at a plurality of predetermined heights between a lengthened position and a retracted position.</p>
  <p num="P-00056">In one presently preferred embodiment, each first member <b>114</b> of the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> includes a pair of outer members <b>118</b> each having a proximal end <b>120</b> and a distal end <b>122</b>. The proximal end of each outer member <b>118</b> is connected to the table top <b>12</b> by means of the cross pole <b>86</b> to which they are preferably fixed (e.g. welded). The second member <b>116</b> of each support pedestal <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> includes a pair of inner members <b>124</b> each having a proximal end <b>126</b> and a distal end <b>128</b>. The proximal end <b>126</b> of the inner members <b>124</b> are configured in dimensional size and shape to engage the distal ends <b>122</b> of the outer members <b>118</b> in telescopic engagement. It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that one or more stabilizer arms <b>90</b> may be employed to support the telescopic pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00057">Preferably, the inner members <b>124</b> and outer members <b>118</b> are separated by a hard plastic bushing (not shown) to facilitate slidable movement of the inner members <b>124</b> relative to the outer members <b>118</b>. Each bushing may be held in place with two small extensions that extend through small holes (not shown) in the Outer members <b>118</b>. It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that there are a number of ways to facilitate the telescopic movement of the first member <b>114</b> relative to the second member <b>116</b> of each support pedestal <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00058">In the preferred embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> include means for locking the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> in preselected positions between the retracted position and the lengthened position. At least one of the inner members <b>124</b> is configured with a first hole <b>134</b>. A corresponding outer member <b>118</b> may be configured with at least one hole <b>136</b> and preferably a plurality of holes <b>136</b> positioned such that at a preselected table top <b>12</b> height, the first hole <b>134</b> in the inner member <b>124</b> may be aligned with a second hole <b>136</b> in the outer member <b>118</b>. In one presently preferred embodiment, a snap pin mechanism <b>138</b> may be positioned adjacent the first hole <b>134</b> within the inner member <b>124</b> such that the pin <b>138</b> is biased outwardly through the aligned holes <b>134</b>, <b>136</b>, thereby locking the inner and outer members <b>118</b>, <b>124</b> of the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> in a preselected position. By supplying sufficient force to the pin mechanism <b>138</b>, it may be disengaged and removed from the hole <b>136</b> in the outer member <b>118</b>, thereby permitting relative movement between the inner <b>124</b> and outer <b>118</b> members of the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> and allowing the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> to be selectively raised or lowered. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that a variety of other adjustment mechanisms as assemblies known in the art for locking the first and second support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> in an extended position may be utilized and are herein incorporated.</p>
  <p num="P-00059">As best shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b>, the distal ends <b>28</b>, <b>34</b> of each pivotal support brace <b>24</b>, <b>30</b> are engageably secured to the retaining assembly <b>36</b> (e.g., cross brace member). In one presently preferred embodiment of the present invention, the distal ends <b>28</b>, <b>34</b> of each pivotal support brace <b>24</b>, <b>30</b>, respectively, are pivotally attached to the retaining assembly <b>36</b>. Each of said distal ends <b>28</b>, <b>34</b> are configured with an opening <b>142</b> having an interior periphery sufficient for engaging at least a portion of the linear length of the cross-brace member <b>36</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00060">It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the retaining assembly <b>36</b> generally provides structural support to the center of the table top <b>12</b> of the utility table <b>10</b>. It will further be appreciated that with the distal ends <b>28</b>, <b>34</b> attached contiguous each other in retention to the cross brace member <b>36</b> forces applied to the table top <b>12</b> which would ordinarily be transferred through one of the support pivotal braces <b>24</b>, <b>30</b>, respectively, into the table top <b>12</b> causing it to bow, will substantially be nullified by the counter force provided by the opposing pivotal support brace <b>24</b>, <b>30</b>, respectively.</p>
  <p num="P-00061">For example, the horizontal component of a force applied by a user at one end <b>68</b> <i>a </i>of the table top <b>12</b> will act upon the pivotal support brace <b>18</b> and, because the distal ends <b>28</b>, <b>34</b> of the pivotal support braces <b>24</b>, <b>30</b>, respectively, are attached to the retaining assembly <b>36</b>, an equal and opposite horizontal force component applied by the other pivotal support brace <b>20</b> will substantially cancel out the horizontal component of the original force. Accordingly, the present invention provides increased structural support to the table top <b>12</b> with fewer parts. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the retaining assembly <b>36</b> can be disposed in a variety of configurations which are consistent with the spirit and scope of the present invention so as to allow the pivotal support braces <b>24</b>, <b>30</b> to supportably interrelate with each other. Such alternative configurations are discussed below.</p>
  <p num="P-00062">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b>, the table top <b>12</b> is preferably formed of a blow-molded plastic, and specifically, high density polyethylene.

  <p num="P-00063">Referring back to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in one presently preferred embodiment of the present invention, the working surface <b>16</b> of the table top <b>12</b> may be smooth or, in the alternative, textured, if desired. In addition, the working surface <b>16</b> may comprise an outer periphery <b>144</b> having at least a portion <b>146</b> that is beveled to increase the comfort of a person resting their arms against the edges of the table top <b>12</b>. In one presently preferred embodiment the entire outer periphery <b>144</b> of the working surface <b>16</b> of the table top <b>12</b> is beveled. The height of the blow-molded table top <b>12</b> of one presently preferred embodiment is about five centimeters, the thickness of any panel <b>13</b> of the blow-molded table top <b>12</b> is preferably about one-half of a centimeter to about three-quarters of a centimeter.</p>
  <p num="P-00064">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the mounting surface <b>14</b> may include at least one mounting member <b>148</b>. Preferably, a pair of mounting members <b>148</b> are attached to the mounting surface <b>14</b> to receive and retain the cross brace member <b>36</b> of the retaining assembly. In one presently preferred embodiment, each mounting member <b>148</b> includes a recess or groove <b>150</b> configured with a corresponding size and shape sufficient to retain the cross brace member <b>36</b> therein. For example, the cross brace member <b>36</b> may snap fit into the recess or groove <b>150</b> of the mounting member <b>148</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00065">Additionally, the mounting surface <b>14</b> of the table top <b>12</b> may further include one or more securing members <b>152</b> for securing each of the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, respectively.

Bach securing member <b>152</b> is generally configured and disposed relative to the mounting surface <b>14</b> such that when the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are in the collapsed position, at least one securing member <b>152</b> frictionally engages a support pedestal post <b>80</b> such that the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, respectively, may be maintained in the collapsed position, as illustrated in FIG. <b>3</b>. In one presently preferred embodiment of the present invention, a pair of securing members <b>152</b> are offset on opposing sides of a single support pedestal post <b>80</b> for securing each of the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, respectively, in the collapsed position. It will be apparent that other mechanisms may be constructed in accordance with the inventive principles set forth herein for securing the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> in the collapsed position. It is intended, therefore, that the examples provided herein be viewed as exemplary of the principles of the present invention, and not as restrictive to a particular structure for implementing those principles.</p>
  <p num="P-00066">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, a first manifold <b>154</b> and a second manifold <b>156</b> are preferably disposed at opposing ends <b>68</b> <i>a</i>, <b>68</b> <i>b </i>of the table top <b>12</b>. The manifolds <b>154</b>, <b>156</b> provide additional support for the ends <b>68</b> <i>a</i>, <b>68</b> <i>b </i>of the table top <b>12</b> and assist in facilitating the blow molding process by providing a means for uniformly dispersing air down the length of the table top <b>12</b>. The mounting surface <b>14</b> of the table top <b>12</b> may also include a plurality of depressions <b>158</b> (e.g., kiss-offs) which tend to add structural support and integrity to the table top <b>12</b>. In one presently preferred embodiment, these depressions <b>158</b> are uniformly distributed throughout the mounting surface <b>14</b> of the table top <b>12</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00067">The structural features of the table top <b>12</b>, including the beveled edges and/or textured working surface <b>16</b>, the mounting members <b>148</b>, the securing members <b>152</b>, the manifolds <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>, and the depressions <b>158</b> may be integral with the table top <b>12</b> and may be formed by means of a corresponding mold and blow-molding process. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that there are alternative ways to create and attach these features. For example, the mounting members <b>148</b>, securing members <b>152</b>, and manifolds <b>154</b>, <b>156</b> may be separate pieces that are attached to the mounting surface <b>14</b> by adhesive bonding or the use of conventional fasteners. Likewise, the texturing and/or beveling of the edges of the working surface of the table top and the introduction of depressions into the mounting surface may also be accomplished after the table top <b>12</b> is molded by a variety of conventional methods readily known in the art.</p>
  <p num="P-00068">As best illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when the utility table <b>10</b> is disposed in an upright position in relation to an underlying surface and the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> extended with the collars <b>108</b> placed over the overlapping portions <b>106</b> of the respective pivotal support braces <b>24</b>, <b>30</b>, the utility table <b>10</b> of the present invention is positioned for use. When a user desires to collapse the utility table <b>10</b> for storage, one presently preferred method for doing so is to invert the utility table <b>10</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>3</b>. With the utility table <b>10</b> in the inverted position, the collars <b>108</b> may be slid away from engagement with the overlapping portion <b>106</b> of the respective pivotal support braces <b>24</b>, <b>30</b>. This allows the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> to be folded inwardly toward the table top <b>12</b> into the collapsed position. With the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> in the collapsed position, the utility table <b>10</b> can easily be moved and stored.</p>
  <p num="P-00069">With reference now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, another presently preferred embodiment of the utility table of the present invention is generally designated at <b>210</b>. In this embodiment, the utility table <b>210</b> includes a table top <b>12</b> having a mounting surface <b>14</b> and a working surface <b>16</b> disposed opposite the mounting surface <b>14</b>. A first support pedestal <b>18</b> and a second support pedestal <b>20</b> are pivotally attached to the mounting surface <b>14</b> of the table top <b>12</b>. Preferably, the first and second support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are independently attached to a support bar <b>212</b> having opposing ends <b>211</b> configured to engage receiving apertures <b>46</b> formed in opposing side rails <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> of a rigid frame <b>40</b> supportably disposed in relation to the table top <b>12</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00070">In one presently preferred embodiment, the support bar <b>212</b> is configured having a bend formed at its opposing ends <b>211</b> to ensure that the first and second support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, respectively, fold properly against the mounting surface <b>14</b> of the table top <b>12</b> when disposed in the collapsed position. As appreciated, the slight bend formed at the opposing ends <b>211</b> of the support bar <b>212</b> has the structural effect of extending the central portion of the support bar <b>212</b> away from the axis of rotation of the support bar <b>212</b> relative to the frame <b>40</b> Moreover, the bending configuration of the support bar <b>212</b> at its opposing ends <b>211</b> provides additional safety, in proportion to the weight applied against the table top <b>12</b>, by maintaining the first and second support pedestals <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> in the extended position</p>
  <p num="P-00071">The support bar <b>212</b> may be omitted from engagement with the proximal end <b>120</b> of the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> in favor of a suitable attachment assembly designed to facilitate pivotal engagement between the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> and the mounting surface <b>14</b> of the table top <b>12</b>. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize other possible modifications and adaptations which are consistent with the spirit and scope of the present invention and which are herein contemplated by the present invention.</p>
  <p num="P-00072">Still referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the utility table <b>210</b> of the present invention may include each first member <b>114</b> of the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> having a pair of outer members <b>118</b> each having a proximal end <b>120</b> and a distal end <b>122</b>. The proximal end of each outer member <b>118</b> is connected to the table top <b>12</b> by means of the support bar <b>212</b> to which they are preferably fixed (e.g., welded). The second member <b>116</b> of each support pedestal <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> includes a pair of inner members <b>124</b> each having a proximal end <b>126</b> and a distal end <b>128</b>. The proximal end <b>126</b> of the inner members <b>124</b> are configured in dimensional size and shape to slidably engage the distal ends <b>122</b> of the outer members <b>118</b> in telescopic engagement.</p>
  <p num="P-00073">Preferably, the inner members <b>124</b> and outer members <b>118</b> are separated by a hard plastic bushing (not shown) to facilitate the slidable movement of the inner members <b>124</b> relative to the outer members <b>118</b>. Each bushing may be held in place with two small extensions that extend through small holes (not shown) in the outer members <b>118</b>. It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that there are numerous ways to facilitate the telescopic movement of the first member <b>114</b> relative to the second member <b>116</b> of each support pedestal <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> which are readily contemplated herein. It is also contemplated herein that the length of the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> may be fixed and, thus, not selectively adjustable to a plurality of heights.</p>
  <p num="P-00074">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an elongated foot member <b>213</b> may be rigidly attached at the distal end <b>128</b> of each of the inner members <b>124</b> of the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> so as to provide additional stability to the table top <b>12</b> when disposed in the upright position. Preferably, the foot member <b>213</b> facilitates a more even dispersion of the supportable weight of the utility table <b>210</b> over a greater portion of the underlying surface. In addition, because the length of the foot member <b>213</b> tends to span the distance between the first and second members <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, one or more stabilizer arms <b>90</b> may be unnecessary.</p>
  <p num="P-00075">Similar to the preferred embodiments of the utility table illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the utility table <b>210</b> includes a first pivotal support brace <b>224</b> having a bifurcated proximal end <b>226</b> attached to the first support pedestal <b>18</b> and a distal end <b>228</b> pivotally attached to a first retaining assembly <b>36</b> <i>a</i>. Similarly, a second pivotal support brace <b>230</b> having a bifurcated proximal end <b>232</b> attached to the second support pedestal <b>20</b> and a distal end <b>234</b> pivotally attached to a second retaining assembly <b>36</b> <i>b</i>. In one presently preferred embodiment, each of the retaining assemblies <b>36</b> <i>a</i>, <b>36</b> <i>b </i>comprise a cross-brace member having opposing ends and an intermediate body portion formed therebetween. Each of the distal ends <b>228</b>, <b>234</b> of the pivotal support braces <b>224</b>, <b>230</b> are configured with openings <b>242</b> having an internal periphery sufficient for engaging at least a portion of the length of the intermediate body portion of the cross-brace members <b>36</b> <i>a</i>, <b>36</b> <i>b</i>, respectively.</p>
  <p num="P-00076">The opposing ends of the first and second cross-brace members <b>36</b> <i>a</i>, <b>36</b> <i>b</i>, respectively, are configured so as to be introduced and retained within corresponding retaining apertures <b>46</b> formed in opposing side rails <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> of the frame <b>40</b> or, in the alternative, within opposing, interior side walls of the table top <b>12</b>. Preferably, the first and second cross-brace members <b>36</b> <i>a</i>, <b>36</b> <i>b </i>are separated by a central portion <b>216</b> of the table top <b>12</b>. Structurally, this central portion <b>216</b> of the table top <b>12</b> must have sufficient structural integrity to support a compressive load, either through the frame <b>40</b>, the entire surface of the table top <b>12</b>, or by some combination of the two, when weight is applied against the table top <b>12</b> to avoid bowing.</p>
  <p num="P-00077">The dual cross-brace supportable configuration of the utility table <b>210</b> of the present invention is advantageous because the pivotal support braces <b>24</b>, <b>30</b> obstruct less of the available space beneath the table top <b>12</b> and between the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. Consequently, more room is available to accommodate the legs of one or more users beneath the table top <b>12</b>, thereby making the utility table <b>210</b> more comfortable to users. Furthermore, the absence of the cross-brace members <b>36</b> <i>a</i>, <b>36</b> <i>b </i>from the central portion <b>216</b> of the table top <b>12</b> provides usable storage space to accommodate the foot members <b>213</b> when the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are disposed in the collapsed position. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the central portion <b>216</b> integrally formed in the mounting surface <b>14</b> of the table top <b>12</b> may be configured having a wider or narrower dimension than illustrated by way of example in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, depending on the overall extended length of the table top <b>12</b>, the supportable weight the table top is designed to bear, the size of the foot members <b>213</b>, and/or the need for usable space beneath the table top <b>12</b> when the utility table <b>210</b> is disposed in the usable position.</p>
  <p num="P-00078">In one presently preferred embodiment, a pair of locking collars <b>217</b> is provided which slidably engage respective overlapping portions of the pivotal support braces <b>224</b>, <b>230</b>. The locking collars <b>217</b> are preferably configured and sized such that when the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are selectively disposed in the extended position, the locking collars <b>217</b> may be engageably positioned in relation to the overlapping portions to prevent the bifurcated proximal ends <b>226</b>, <b>232</b> from moving relative to the corresponding distal ends <b>228</b>, <b>234</b> of the pivotal support braces <b>224</b>, <b>230</b>, thus preventing the support pedestal supports <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> from being positioned in the collapsed position without first disengaging the locking collars <b>217</b>, respectively.</p>
  <p num="P-00079">As with the previous preferred embodiments illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, a plurality of kiss-offs <b>218</b> may be formed in the mounting surface <b>14</b> of the table top <b>12</b> to add structural integrity and strength to the working surface <b>16</b> of the blow molded table top. In addition, a plurality of plateaus <b>219</b> and longitudinal trenches <b>220</b> may also be formed in the mounting surface <b>14</b> to further add stiffening and strength to the table top <b>12</b>. Correspondingly, these plateaus <b>219</b> and trenches <b>220</b> operably function to increase the section modulus of the table top <b>12</b> by moving material away from the neutral axis of the table top <b>12</b>, thus making it more difficult to bend the table top <b>12</b> in a longitudinal direction, as when a heavy load is positioned in the middle of the table top <b>12</b>. As will be appreciated, the kiss-offs <b>218</b> may be formed within the trenches <b>220</b> to ensure that the table top <b>12</b> can be made hollow without concern that the working surface <b>16</b> may have a tendency to flex inwardly toward the mounting surface <b>14</b> when a weight is placed on the table top <b>12</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00080">Additionally, an opening <b>222</b> may be formed in the table top <b>12</b> to provide means for introducing a support pole of an umbrella assembly (not shown) or the like. Although certain structural elements and components, such as: (1) one or more stabilizer arms <b>90</b> engageably disposed in relation to the first and second member <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> of the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> (see FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>); (2) one or more mounting members <b>148</b> for supportably retaining the retaining assembly <b>36</b> in relation to the mounting surface <b>14</b> of the table top <b>12</b> (see FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>); (3) one or more securing members <b>152</b> attached to the mounting surface <b>14</b> of the table top <b>12</b> for securing the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> in the collapsed position (see FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>); (4) one or more manifolds <b>154</b>, <b>156</b> that assist in facilitating the blow molding process by providing for uniform dispersion of air along the length of the blow molded table top <b>12</b> (see FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>); and (5) beveled edges and/or a textured working surface <b>16</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) have been omitted from the embodiment of the utility table <b>210</b> illustrated in FIG. <b>4</b>. It is contemplated herein that one or more of these structural features, however, may be incorporated into the alternate design of the utility table <b>210</b>, if desired.</p>
  <p num="P-00081">With reference now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, another presently preferred embodiment of the utility table of the present invention is “generally” designated at <b>310</b>. As shown, the utility table <b>310</b> includes a table top <b>12</b> having a mounting surface <b>14</b> and a working surface <b>16</b> disposed opposite the mounting surface. Structurally, the table top <b>12</b> is preferably supported above an underlying surface by a first support pedestal <b>18</b> and a second support pedestal <b>20</b> disposed at spaced-apart relationship to the first support pedestal. Both the first and second support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are preferably attached to the mounting surface <b>14</b> or, in the alternative, to a rigid support frame <b>40</b>. A first pivotal support brace <b>324</b> includes a proximal end <b>326</b> pivotally attached to the first support pedestal <b>18</b> and a distal end <b>328</b> pivotally attached to a retaining assembly <b>36</b>. Similarly, a second pivotal support brace <b>330</b> is shown having a proximal end <b>332</b> pivotally attached to the second support pedestal <b>20</b> and a distal end <b>334</b> pivotally attached to the retaining assembly <b>36</b>. As will be appreciated, the distal ends <b>328</b>, <b>334</b> of the first and second pivotal support braces <b>324</b>, <b>330</b>, respectively, may be pivotally attached to the mounting surface <b>14</b> by means of an engaging bracket (not shown).</p>
  <p num="P-00082">Because the alternate preferred embodiment of the utility table <b>310</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, is substantially similar in construction to the utility table <b>10</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, only those structural variations that exist between these two embodiments will be further disclosed hereinbelow.</p>
  <p num="P-00083">Specifically, one presently preferred embodiment of the utility table <b>310</b> includes a first support pedestal <b>18</b> having two support legs <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>. Each of the support legs <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> of the first support pedestal <b>18</b> may be formed having a proximate end <b>316</b> rigidly attached to a cross pole <b>86</b> mounted in pivotal relation to the frame <b>40</b> or, in the alternative, to the mounting surface <b>14</b> of the table top <b>12</b> independent of the other leg. Similarly, each of the support legs <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> of the second support pedestal <b>20</b> may be formed having a proximate end <b>316</b> rigidly attached to a cross pole <b>86</b> mounted in pivotal relation to the frame <b>40</b> or, in the alternative, to the mounting surface <b>14</b> of the table top <b>12</b> independent of the other leg.</p>
  <p num="P-00084">To accommodate a table top <b>12</b> having a length that is smaller than the fixed or extendable length of the legs <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> of the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, the relative disposition of the distal ends <b>318</b> of each of the support legs <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> of the first support pedestal <b>18</b> are offset from the corresponding distal ends <b>318</b> of each of the support legs <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> of the second support pedestal <b>20</b> disposed on an opposite side of the table top <b>12</b>. The distal end <b>318</b> of the first support leg <b>312</b> of the first support pedestal <b>18</b> is offset in a lateral direction <b>320</b> from the second support leg <b>314</b> of the first support pedestal. Similarly, the distal end <b>318</b> of the first support leg <b>312</b> of the second support pedestal <b>20</b> is offset in a lateral direction <b>320</b> from the second support leg <b>314</b> of the second support pedestal <b>20</b>. This offset configuration enables the use of a smaller table top <b>12</b> and frame <b>40</b> because the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> can include a length greater than the distance between the opposing ends of the table top <b>12</b>, and yet still fold into a parallel configuration relative to the mounting surface <b>14</b> of the table top <b>12</b> without interference by the distal ends <b>318</b> of each of the support legs <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> of the first and second support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00085">The foregoing function can be structurally accomplished in a variety of ways. For example, both the proximal and distal ends <b>316</b>, <b>318</b> of the support legs <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> may be laterally offset so that the legs <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> are always parallel to the frame <b>40</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>5</b>. Alternatively, the proximal ends <b>316</b> may remain aligned in the folded position, and the legs <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> may fold at an angle. This may be done by pivotally mounting the proximal ends <b>316</b> to the mounting surface <b>14</b> at an angle, or by mounting the cross pole <b>86</b> at a diagonal angle with respect to the frame <b>40</b> and table top <b>12</b>.</p>
  <p num="P-00086">As discussed above, the retaining assembly <b>36</b> generally provides structural support to the center of the table top <b>12</b> of the utility table <b>310</b>. It will be further appreciated that with the distal ends <b>328</b>, <b>334</b> attached contiguous each other in retention to the cross-brace member <b>36</b>, forces applied to the table top <b>12</b> which would ordinarily be transferred through one of the support pivotal braces <b>324</b>, <b>330</b>, respectively, into the table top <b>12</b> causing it to bow, will substantially be nullified by the counter force provided by the opposing pivotal support brace <b>324</b>, <b>330</b>, respectively.</p>
  <p num="P-00087">For example, the horizontal component of a force applied by a user at one end of the table top <b>12</b> will act upon the one of the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> and, because the distal ends <b>328</b>, <b>334</b> of the pivotal support braces <b>224</b>, <b>330</b>, respectively, are attached to the retaining assembly <b>36</b>, an equal and opposite horizontal force component applied by the other pivotal support brace <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> will cancel out the horizontal force component of the original force. Accordingly, although the support legs <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> of the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are offset, the structural configuration of the present invention provides increased structural support to the table top <b>12</b> with fewer parts. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the retaining assembly <b>36</b> may be disposed in a variety of configurations that are consistent with the spirit and scope of the present invention so as to allow the pivotal support braces <b>324</b>, <b>330</b> to supportably interrelate with each other. Moreover, the utility table <b>210</b>, which is shown in FIG. <b>4</b> and discussed in detail above, may include support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> that comprise spaced-apart support legs which are offset from the corresponding support legs of the opposing support pedestal to provide the advantages of overlapping the legs, if desired.</p>
  <p num="P-00088">Although certain structural elements and components, such as: (1) telescoping support legs operable to adjust the height of the table top <b>12</b> above an underlying surface, (2) a second cross-brace member <b>36</b> <i>b </i>formed independent of a first cross-brace member <b>36</b> <i>a</i>(see FIG. <b>4</b>); (3) a plurality of kiss-offs <b>158</b> formed in the mounting surface <b>14</b> of the table top <b>12</b> (see FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>), (4) one or more mounting members <b>148</b> for supportably retaining the retaining assembly <b>36</b> in relation to the mounting surface <b>14</b> of the table top <b>12</b> (See FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>), (5) one or more securing members <b>152</b> attached to the mounting surface <b>14</b> of the table top <b>12</b> for securing the support pedestals <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> in the collapsed position (see FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>); (6) one or more manifolds <b>154</b>, <b>156</b> that assist in facilitating the blow molding process by providing for uniform dispersion of air along the length of the blow molded table top <b>12</b> (see FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>); (7) a bend formed in the opposing ends <b>211</b> of the support bar <b>212</b> (see FIG. <b>4</b>); (8) beveled edges and/or a textured working surface <b>16</b> (See FIG. <b>1</b>); and (9) a plurality of plateaus <b>219</b> and longitudinal trenches <b>220</b> may also be formed in the mounting surface <b>14</b> to further add stiffening and strength to the table top <b>12</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) have been omitted from the embodiment of the utility table <b>310</b> illustrated in FIG. <b>5</b>. It is contemplated herein that one or more of the foregoing structural features, however, may be incorporated into the design of the utility table <b>310</b>, if desired.</p>
  <p num="P-00089">Many of the problems associated with prior art portable folding utility tables are addressed by the teachings of the present invention. From the above discussion, it will be appreciated that the present invention provides a novel portable folding utility table having a center support assembly that is durable enough to withstand increased wear and tear, yet is light-weight enough to easily set up and take down. The present invention also provides a utility table with a center support retaining assembly that provides increased stability and structural integrity with an efficient design that allows the interrelation of the support pedestals to each other. The center support retaining assembly of the utility table of the present invention is also cost effective to manufacture and does not compromise the structural integrity of the table top. The present invention also provides a portable folding utility table that includes a work surface disposed at a height that is comfortable to work at. Additionally, features are provided to improve the functionality of longer and smaller tables under various use and loading conditions.</p>
  <p num="P-00090">It should be appreciated that the apparatus of the present invention is capable of being incorporated in the form of a variety of embodiments, only a few of which have been illustrated and described above. The invention may be embodied in other forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope.</p>
