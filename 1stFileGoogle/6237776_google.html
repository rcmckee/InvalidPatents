    <heading>FIELD OF INVENTION</heading> <p>This application is a continuation application filed under 37 CFR § 1.53(b) of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/122,088 filed Jul. 24, 1988 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,092,661.</p>
    <p>This invention relates generally to portable packs that include a cooling compartment. In particular it relates to a kind of portable pack that can be used in a number of outdoor activities, such as, for example, while golfing.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>People enjoying outdoor activities often desire refreshment. In the summer the usual desire is for something cool to drink. In the spring or fall a warm beverage or snack may be preferred. It may be that those persons wishing refreshment are a considerable distance from the nearest tea shop or refreshment stand. They may have hiked some distance, or, in the case of golf, have reached a point far out on the course. In such circumstances it is convenient to be able to take a supply of cooled or heated refreshments along, for use as desired.</p>
    <p>Another related problem, particularly when golfing as a visitor, is that secure locker facilities may not be available. It is often uncomfortable to golf with a wallet or set of keys contained in one or another pants pocket. A golfer may wish to keep his or her valuables, such as a wallet and car keys, close at hand during a round of golf, in a container that is within the golfer's view. In recent times the growing popularity of cellular telephones has made it possible for golfers, hikers, cross country skiers, picnickers or others, to remain in touch with their business colleagues while enjoying their outdoor activities, often so smoothly that others may be scarcely aware that they are not at the office. A cellular telephone is another object that is uncomfortable to carry when golfing or skiing, for example. Cellular telephones are easily stolen and highly marketable. For both convenience of use and discouragement of theft they should be kept relatively close to the user. At the same time, the ability to carry, for example, extra golf balls, chocolate bars, or gum, and to carry a score card or map in a visible position, with enhanced accessibility are further common needs.</p>
    <p>It may be uncomfortable, or cumbersome to having a multiplicity of objects to carry. A number of items may fit within a golf bag, along with various clubs, but the golf bag may not be sufficiently large to carry some items, and some items may risk damage if placed in the golf bag itself. A golf bag is not generally a convenient place to have a cooling medium, such as ice cubes. Further, the prospect of spilling lemonade, carbonated drinks, or beer, however much by accident, inside either the golf bag amongst the woods and irons, or in a pocket of the golf bag, is not one that would be greeted with enthusiasm by many golfers. A segregated auxiliary carrying case that is separately washable, that is mountable to the golf bag, and that can be carried with it is preferable. It would be even more advantageous to have a pack that can be mounted with the golf bag when the bag is carried on a wheeled carriage or in a golf cart. In this way a golfer's hands are not further encumbered.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>In a first aspect of the invention there is a pack. It has an insulated compartment, an auxiliary compartment mounted next to the insulated compartment and a mount for attaching the pack to another object. The auxiliary compartment has a receptacle of a size for receiving a telephone handset, another receptacle of a size for receiving a wallet, and a closure securable in a closed position to conceal the contents of the receptacles.</p>
    <p>In an additional feature of that aspect of the invention, the pack has a breadth corresponding to the thickness of a golf bag. In another additional feature of that aspect of the invention, the pack has a second mount for inhibiting swaying of the pack relative to the other object. In a further additional feature of that aspect of the invention, the pack includes a see-through pocket mounted externally to the auxiliary compartment. The see-through pocket is of a size to receive a golf ball.</p>
    <p>In another additional feature of that aspect of the invention, the pack has a leading panel for placement adjacent to the golf bag, a pair of side regions, a trailing region, a bottom and a top. A see-through pocket is mounted to one of said side regions. The see-through pocket has an access lip that has a leading portion and a trailing portion. The leading portion has a greater altitudinal dimension relative to said pocket than said trailing portion.</p>
    <p>In a further additional feature of that aspect of the invention, the pack has a lid. The lid has a handle. The handle has a reinforced attachment to the lid, whereby, when closed, the pack can be carried by the handle.</p>
    <p>In a still further additional feature of that aspect of the invention, the insulated compartment has a substantially impermeable liner; and the liner can be inverted to facilitate washing. In yet another additional feature, the insulating compartment has a thermal transfer medium holder, and that holder is vented.</p>
    <p>In still another further additional feature of that aspect of the invention, the auxiliary compartment includes a key holder. In a still further feature of that additional feature, the key holder includes a lanyard secured within said auxiliary compartment.</p>
    <p>In another aspect of the invention, there is an insulated pack. It has an insulated compartment. It has a first mount, for carrying the weight of the pack. The first mount is located on an upper region of the pack and is for attaching the pack to another object. The pack also has a second mount located on a lower region of the pack for attaching to the other object at a different location than the first mount.</p>
    <p>In an additional feature of this aspect of the invention, the pack is reinforced at the location at which the first mount is attached to it. In another additional feature of the invention, the pack is reinforced at the location at which the second mount is attached to it. In a further additional feature, the first mount is a quick release-hanging mount and the second mount is a cinch strap.</p>
    <p>In another additional feature of that aspect of the invention, the pack further comprises a soft shell wall having leading portion, a trailing portion, a pair of side portions, and a bottom portion. The soft shell wall has an opening in the upper region. The opening has a rim. The pack has a lid for closing the opening, and an upper girth reinforcement for reinforcing said rim. It also has a lower girth reinforcement for reinforcing the lower region. In a further additional feature, the lid has a carrying handle, is moveable to a closed position, and has a securable closure whereby, when closed, the pack can be carried by the handle.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The description, which follows, and the embodiments described therein, are provided by way of illustration of an example, or examples of particular embodiments of the principles of the present invention. These examples are provided for the purposes of explanation, and not of limitation, of those principles and of the invention. In the description, which follows, like parts are marked throughout the specification and the drawings with the same respective reference numerals. The drawings are not necessarily to scale and in some instances proportions may have been exaggerated in order more clearly to depict certain features of the invention.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIGS. 1, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b>, an insulated pack having a shape that is generally similar to a golf bag, but on a smaller scale, is shown generally as <b>20</b>. It has a leading portion <b>22</b>, a trailing portion <b>24</b>, a pair of left and right hand side portions <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, a top portion <b>30</b> having a lid <b>32</b>, and a bottom portion <b>34</b>. The major part of pack <b>20</b> is an insulated compartment <b>36</b> bounded by a modestly flexible soft shell insulating wall, <b>38</b>, whose construction is shown in FIG. <b>7</b>. The breadth of pack <b>20</b>, that is, the overall width when viewed from the leading or trailing directions, is about 8½″ empty. When undeformed pack <b>20</b> has a gently bulging D-shaped cross section when seen from above, similar to a golf bag, although this may change somewhat when loaded. The breadth is roughly the same as the thickness of a middling to large size of golf bag. Referring briefly to the detail of FIG. 7, wall <b>38</b> has an outer covering <b>42</b> of webbed construction, and an internal closed cell foam layer <b>44</b> within covering <b>42</b>.</p>
    <p>Further, liner <b>46</b> is not, in the example illustrated, fixed to the bottom of compartment <b>36</b>, but can be pulled out of compartment <b>36</b> to an inverted position (while still remaining attached at rim <b>48</b>) to facilitate washing with soap, and to facilitate drying, to discourage the grow of fungus and so on. Liner <b>46</b> has a single circumferential seam to join a bottom face, and a single wall seam running from the circumferential bottom seam to rim <b>48</b>. In an optional alternative, liner <b>46</b> could be made from a polymer that has been impregnated with an antimicrobial compound prior to fabrication, a desirable feature for this kind of liner.</p>
    <p>The top of compartment <b>36</b> is formed by generally D shaped lid <b>32</b>. Lid <b>32</b> also has a through section structure of a flexible reflective inner layer, <b>52</b>, a flexible skin in the nature of a canvas or webbing covering, <b>54</b>, and a flexible closed cell insulation layer <b>55</b>, (similar to layer <b>44</b>, above) captured inbetween. Lid <b>32</b> is joined to the main body of pack <b>20</b>, along the roughly straight side of the ‘D’ shape, by a hinge in the nature of a flexible fabric hinge <b>56</b>, and a peripheral tracked closure in the nature of a zipper <b>58</b> having a pair of opposed zipper cars.</p>
    <p>Rim <b>48</b> has a resiliently spongy beaded lip <b>60</b> wrapped within the upper edge of liner <b>46</b>, adjacent to the set of zipper teeth <b>59</b> of zipper <b>58</b> that is mounted to the main body of pack <b>22</b>. Lid <b>32</b> has a mating generally ‘D’ shaped peripheral lip <b>62</b> immediately next to the set of zipper teeth <b>61</b> of zipper <b>58</b> mounted to lid <b>32</b>. When zipper <b>58</b> is closed, lip <b>62</b> is drawn down to bear on the outside surface of beaded lip <b>60</b>, encouraging a sealing contact to be formed.</p>
    <p>Within main compartment <b>36</b> a thermal transfer storage medium compartment is provided against a leading wall portion of insulating wall <b>38</b> by the use of a sack <b>64</b> for holding the thermal storage medium <b>66</b>. Thermal storage medium <b>66</b> may be used as a source of heat to be transferred into the contents of compartment <b>36</b>, that is, to maintain a warm temperature distribution in compartment <b>36</b>. Alternatively, the thermal storage medium <b>66</b> can be used as a heat sink to maintain a cool, chilled, or freezing temperature distribution in the contents of compartment <b>36</b>, as circumstances may require. Sack <b>64</b> has an array of perforations <b>68</b> to allow air to circulate through sack <b>64</b> more easily, facilitating drying of sack <b>64</b> after washing.</p>
    <p>The second major component of insulated pack <b>20</b> is an auxiliary compartment in the nature of a valuables compartment <b>70</b>, that is mounted to trailing portion <b>24</b>, externally of soft shelled insulating wall <b>38</b>. Compartment <b>70</b> has a pair of left and right hand side portions <b>72</b> and <b>74</b> that are connected to and extend vertically along, and rearwardly from the trailing portion of insulating wall <b>38</b>; and a single piece trailing wall <b>76</b> extending between the distal extremities of side portions <b>72</b> and <b>74</b>. In the preferred embodiment wall <b>76</b> is, like the rest of cover <b>42</b>, made of a 600 denier polyester fabric, treated, as are all external surfaces of pack <b>20</b>, to be stain and water resistant. Other wall fabrics can be used, such as leather or leather-like vinyl.</p>
    <p>Wall <b>76</b> has a lower or underside area <b>78</b> that meets, and is joined to, the trailing portion of insulating wall <b>38</b>. Underside area <b>78</b> forms the bottom of compartment <b>70</b>. Wall <b>76</b> also has a medial, outer area <b>80</b> that extends roughly ⅖ of the way up compartment <b>70</b>. An upper area <b>82</b> of wall <b>76</b>, in the nature of a flap, is contiguous with outer area <b>80</b> on one edge, and has closures on the remainder of its periphery. Two of those closures are left and right hand vertical zippers, <b>84</b> and <b>86</b>, that join with the uppermost parts of the distal edges of side portions <b>72</b> and <b>74</b>. The third is a hook and eye fabric closure <b>88</b> for releasably attaching end lip <b>90</b> of wall <b>76</b> to insulated wall <b>38</b> just below rim <b>48</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 3, in which closures <b>84</b>, <b>86</b> and <b>88</b> are undone, and upper area <b>82</b> lies open, a first receptacle, in the nature of a soft sided, durable fabric pocket <b>92</b> with a covering flap <b>93</b> has a horizontal hook and eye fastener part <b>96</b> mounted on its underside just inside its lip, for mating with a vertically aligned mating hook and eye fabric fastener part <b>97</b>, the combination of orientations providing an adjustable size, and flexibility in closure position. Pocket <b>92</b> is of a size for carrying a cellular telephone handset, having a girth of roughly 5½″ (roughly 1-¼″ deep sides and 3″ breadth) and a depth of 6½″ from bottom to lip. The interior of pocket <b>92</b> is lined with a cushioning material. Pocket <b>92</b> can be used for other objects than cellular telephones such as for sunglasses, a glasses case, or other item.</p>
    <p>An adjacent receptacle in the nature of a soft-sided, open top pocket <b>94</b>, without cover, has a convenient size (roughly 4½″ girth, 5½″ depth) for holding a deodorant container, or other object of similar size. It can, for example, be used as a storage space for a carrying strap. Adjacent to pocket <b>94</b> is a key holder in the nature of a lanyard <b>96</b> having one end fastened within compartment <b>70</b> just below rim <b>48</b>. At its other, depending end lanyard <b>96</b> has a quick-release spring clip <b>98</b> for hooking about the ring of a key chain. Use of a strap, such as lanyard <b>96</b>, makes it easy to retrieve keys, rather than having to fish around the bottom of compartment <b>70</b>. The remaining enclosed space within medial outer area <b>80</b> and above underside area <b>78</b> has a height of roughly 4 inches, and a width of roughly 7 inches between the piping along the outer edges of side portions <b>72</b> and <b>74</b>, leaving space for a wallet, or other items.</p>
    <p>Other arrangements of closures are possible for auxiliary compartment <b>70</b>. A single three sided zipper closure, with one or two zipper cars could be used, and the hook and eye fastener eliminated. Other kinds of fasteners, such as laces and grommets, interference fit seals, snaps, buttons, and so on are possible. The present arrangement is preferred. Similarly, other arrangements of receptacles and key holders, or like items can be used, although the present configuration is convenient, and preferred.</p>
    <p>A vented, see-through pocket <b>100</b> is mounted externally to medial outer area <b>80</b>, and is of a size for accommodating, for example, extra golf balls, gum, candy bars or other items. The open form mesh <b>102</b> permits objects in pocket <b>100</b> to dry more easily. Pocket <b>100</b> is closed by a sliding closure in the form of zipper <b>104</b>.</p>
    <p>A main attachment, suitable, for example, for hanging pack <b>20</b> from a golf bag, or for clipping pack <b>20</b> to a golf bag or golf cart, is shown as a quick release brass hook fitting <b>110</b> is mounted to an upper region of pack <b>20</b> on leading portion <b>22</b>. Hook fitting <b>110</b> is free to revolve within its hinge fitting, <b>112</b>, which itself is able to swing up and down within the confines of a broad loop of webbing <b>114</b>.</p>
    <p>A second attachment, suitable for tightening to another fastening location of a golf bag or golf cart, in the nature of an adjustable cinch strap <b>116</b> is mounted to a lower region of pack <b>20</b>, also on leading portion <b>22</b>. Strap <b>116</b> has a releasable catch <b>118</b>, and can be used to tighten the lower region of pack <b>20</b> to a golf bag, golf cart, or other object, to restrain its swaying motion about the main attachment at hook fitting <b>110</b>.</p>
    <p>It is anticipated that a significant use of main insulated compartment <b>36</b> will be for carrying cans of liquid, such as carbonated beverages, fruit drinks, or beer, whether or not accompanied by ice cubes or crushed ice. Inasmuch as the preferred embodiment illustrated has a capacity of 12 cans of 385 ml plus ice, a load of 10 to 12 Lbs. (50 to 55 N) would not be unexpected. The height of the preferred embodiment illustrated to the lip of rim <b>48</b> is roughly 12 inches. Liner <b>46</b> is not taut when lying against the inner walls of compartment <b>36</b>. That is, liner <b>46</b> has some slack, and is somewhat elastic in any event. Consequently load is taken up primarily, if not entirely, in soft shelled insulating wall, <b>38</b>, and more specifically, principally in outer covering <b>42</b> of wall <b>38</b>.</p>
    <p>The main attachment at hook fitting <b>110</b> is able to carry the entire weight of pack <b>20</b>, and the second attachment, at cinch strap <b>116</b>, inhibits swaying of pack <b>20</b> about the first attachment. Outer covering <b>42</b> has an upper reinforcing band <b>120</b> extending externally about the periphery of insulating wall <b>38</b> next to rim <b>48</b>. A lower reinforcing band <b>122</b> extends externally about the bottom edge of pack <b>20</b> where leading portion <b>22</b>, trailing portion <b>24</b>, and side portions <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> meet bottom portion <b>34</b>, that is to say, about the lower region of pack <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p>A pair of left and right hand web doublers, <b>124</b> and <b>126</b> commence at a relatively high location at the leading edges of respective side portions <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, extend across the surface of those sides, and terminate at a lower location on the trailing edge of side portions <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. That is, they extend from the leading edge of the upper region, to the trailing edge of a lower region of pack <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p>The attachment of hook fitting <b>110</b> to pack <b>20</b> is reinforced by an upper lateral reinforcing band <b>130</b>, in addition to upper reinforcing band <b>120</b>, the effect being to spread the stress concentration out. Lateral reinforcing band <b>130</b> ends at the leading edges of side portions <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, close to the leading ends of doublers <b>124</b> and <b>126</b>, yielding a reinforced load path between the lower region of pack <b>20</b> and hook fitting <b>110</b>.</p>
    <p>Similarly, each end of cinch strap <b>116</b> is sewn under a vertical left or right hand root reinforcement <b>132</b> or <b>134</b>, each of these in turn leading to either lower reinforcing band <b>122</b> or a lower lateral reinforcement band <b>136</b>, whose ends reach to the leading edges of side portions <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>.</p>
    <p>For ease and comfort of carrying pack <b>20</b> by hand, lid <b>32</b> is provided with a carrying handle <b>140</b> having a padded bail <b>142</b>, and a pair of webbing feet <b>144</b> and <b>146</b> that extend fully to opposite points on the periphery of lid <b>32</b>, such that loads carried through handle <b>140</b> are transmitted not only through the outer covering layer of lid <b>32</b> but also through the reinforcement of feet <b>144</b> and <b>146</b>. At the edge of lid <b>32</b> the presence of upper reinforcing band <b>120</b> helps to spread the load more evenly to and from the vertical sidewalls formed by portions <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>28</b>. Alternatively, pack <b>20</b> can be carried by a shoulder strap <b>148</b> fastened by spring clips to D-shaped rings <b>150</b> and <b>152</b>, mounted on either of sides <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>.</p>
    <p>Left hand side portion <b>26</b> is provided with a trapezoidally shaped external pocket <b>154</b> having a breathing, see-through mesh <b>156</b> similar to mesh <b>102</b>. A scorecard, or map, placed in this pocket can be seen for retrieval. Lip <b>158</b> of pocket <b>154</b> is set on a rake angle, yielding a somewhat larger opening for sliding a scorecard in, without having as carefully to fit it into a narrow opening as might otherwise be the case for a square cut pocket.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIGS. 4 and 5, a second insulated pack, is shown generally as <b>170</b>. In this embodiment, pack <b>170</b> is of a size for carrying 5 cans. It has a leading portion <b>172</b>, a trailing portion <b>174</b>, a pair of left and right hand side portions <b>176</b> and <b>178</b>, a top portion <b>180</b> having a lid <b>182</b>, and a bottom portion <b>184</b>. The major part of pack <b>170</b> is an insulated compartment <b>186</b> bounded by a modestly flexible soft shell insulating wall, <b>188</b>, whose wall construction is the same as that shown in FIG. <b>7</b> and discussed above. The breadth of pack <b>170</b>, that is, the overall width when viewed from the leading or trailing directions, is about 6½″ empty. When undeformed pack <b>170</b> has a gently bulging D-shaped cross section when seen from above again, not dissimilar in general appearance to a golf bag. The breadth is roughly the same as the thickness of a small size of golf bag, and, is such that pack <b>170</b> can nest comfortably within compartment <b>36</b> of pack <b>20</b>. This is shown in FIG. <b>6</b>.</p>
    <p>The top of compartment <b>186</b> is formed by generally D shaped lid <b>182</b>. Lid <b>182</b> has the same layered construction as lid <b>32</b>. Lid <b>182</b> is joined to the main body of pack <b>170</b>, along the roughly straight side of the ‘D’ shape, by a hinge in the nature of a flexible fabric hinge <b>206</b>, and a peripheral tracked closure in the nature of a zipper <b>208</b> having a pair of opposed zipper cars. The manner of closing lid <b>182</b> on compartment <b>186</b> of pack <b>170</b> is the same as for lid <b>32</b> of pack <b>20</b>. Further, the same kind of substantially impermeable liner and thermal storage medium are used. The thermal storage medium is held in a sack like sack <b>64</b>.</p>
    <p>The second major component of insulated pack <b>170</b> is an auxiliary compartment in the nature of a valuables compartment <b>220</b>, that is mounted to trailing portion <b>174</b>, externally of soft shelled insulating wall <b>188</b>. Compartment <b>220</b> has a generally downwardly opening, U-shaped member <b>221</b> that has pair of left and right hand side portions <b>222</b> and <b>224</b> that are connected to and extend vertically along, and rearwardly from the trailing portion of insulating wall <b>188</b> and a top cross portion <b>223</b> extending between them. Compartment <b>220</b> also has a single piece trailing wall <b>226</b> extending between the distal extremities of side portions <b>222</b> and <b>224</b>. Wall <b>226</b> is made of canvas. Wall <b>226</b> has a lower or underside area <b>228</b>, that meets and is joined to the trailing portion of insulating wall <b>188</b>. Underside area <b>228</b> forms the bottom and lower trailing face of compartment <b>220</b>. Wall <b>226</b> also has an upper area <b>232</b>, being a flap contiguous with underside area <b>228</b> on one edge. Upper area <b>232</b> has a three sided wrap-around closure, being a zipper <b>234</b> that joins the corresponding edge of U-shaped member <b>221</b>. As described above in the context of pack <b>20</b>, compartment <b>220</b> has internal receptacles lined with cushioning for receiving valuables, glasses, keys, and so on.</p>
    <p>A main attachment, suitable, for example, for hanging pack <b>170</b> from a golf bag, or for clipping pack <b>170</b> to a golf bag or golf cart, is shown as a quick release brass hook fitting <b>240</b>, mounted to an upper region of pack <b>170</b> on leading portion <b>172</b>. Hook fitting <b>240</b> is free to revolve within its hinge fitting, <b>242</b>, which itself is able to swing up and down within the confines of a broad loop of webbing <b>244</b>.</p>
    <p>A second attachment, suitable for tightening to another fastening location of a golf bag or golf cart, in the nature of an adjustable cinch strap <b>246</b> is mounted to a lower region of pack <b>170</b>, also on leading portion <b>172</b>, but in this case being rooted at the outside edges of leading portion <b>172</b> where they meet the leading edges of side portions <b>176</b> and <b>178</b>. Strap <b>246</b> has a releasable catch <b>248</b>, and can be used to tighten the lower region of pack <b>170</b> to a golf bag, golf cart, or other object, to restrain its swaying motion about the main attachment at hook fitting <b>240</b>.</p>
    <p>Outer covering <b>192</b> has an upper reinforcing band <b>250</b> extending externally about the periphery of insulating wall <b>188</b> next to rim <b>198</b>. A lower reinforcing band <b>252</b> extends externally about the bottom edge of pack <b>170</b> where leading portion <b>172</b>, trailing portion <b>174</b>, and side portions <b>176</b> and <b>178</b> meet bottom portion <b>184</b>, that is to say, about the lower region of pack <b>170</b>.</p>
    <p>A pair of left and right hand doublers, <b>254</b> and <b>256</b> commence at a relatively high location at the leading edges of respective side portions <b>176</b> and <b>178</b>, extend across the surface of those sides, and terminate at a lower location on the trailing edge of side portions <b>176</b> and <b>178</b>.</p>
    <p>The attachment of hook fitting <b>240</b> to pack <b>170</b> is reinforced by an upper lateral reinforcing band <b>260</b>, in addition to upper reinforcing band <b>250</b>, the effect being to spread the load out. Lateral reinforcing band <b>260</b> ends at the leading edges of side portions <b>176</b> and <b>178</b>, close to the leading ends of doublers <b>254</b> and <b>256</b>, yielding a reinforced load path between the lower region of pack <b>170</b> and hook fitting <b>240</b>.</p>
    <p>Lid <b>182</b> is provided with a carrying handle <b>270</b> having a padded bail <b>272</b>, and a pair of webbing feet <b>274</b> and <b>276</b> that extend fully to opposite points on the periphery of lid <b>182</b>, such that loads carried through handle <b>270</b> are transmitted not only through the outer covering layer of lid <b>182</b> but also through the reinforcement of feet <b>274</b> and <b>276</b>. At the edge of lid <b>182</b> the presence of upper reinforcing band <b>250</b> helps to spread the load more evenly to and from the vertical sidewalls formed by portions <b>172</b>, <b>174</b>, <b>176</b>, and <b>178</b>.</p>
    <p>Left hand side portion <b>176</b> is provided with a trapezoidally shaped external pocket <b>284</b> having a breathing, see-through mesh <b>286</b> similar to mesh <b>102</b>. Lip <b>288</b> of pocket <b>284</b> is set on a rake angle.</p>
    <p>A preferred embodiment has been described in detail and a number of alternatives have been considered. As changes in or additions to the above described embodiments may be made without departing from the nature, spirit or scope of the invention, the invention is not to be limited by or to those details, but only by the appended claims or their equivalents.</p>
