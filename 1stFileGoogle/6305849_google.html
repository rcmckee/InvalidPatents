The continuous ceramic sleeves have internal bores which are slightly larger than the outside diameter of the periphery of the termini, providing a clearance fit between the continuous ceramic sleeves and respective ones of the termini. The termini are independently gimbaled, with gimbal points being disposed distally from respective mating planes between opposing terminal ends of the termini. Floating seal assemblies extend around respective ones of the termini between the mating planes and the gimbal points, and seal between the respective ones of the termini and a connector housing. The floating seal assemblies each include an annular-shaped, floating collar having an aperture through which a respective one of the termini extends. The floating collar is free to move parallel to a longitudinal axis of the respective termini, and also transverse thereto. A first seal element seals between the aperture of the floating collar and the respective termini. The floating collar includes a face which extends transverse to the longitudinal axis of the respective termini. A second seal element extends around the longitudinal axis of the respective termini and is sealingly engaged between the face of the floating collar and a seal surface of a bore in the connector housing.</div>

    <heading>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading> <p>The present application is a continuation-in-part of, and claims priority to, U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/119,227, filed Feb. 9, 1999 and entitled “FIBER OPTIC CONNECTOR.”</p>
    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention relates in general to optical fiber light transmission systems, and in particular to connectors for use in coupling optical fiber conductors together.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Prior art fiber optic cable connectors have been provided for joining cables which contain optical fibers. The cables are coupled so that the optical fibers of the different cables are aligned for transmitting light signals therebetween. In some applications, the cable connectors are coupled and decoupled numerous times for temporary installations, and may also be exposed to contaminants such as moisture, dust, smoke and fumes. Such fiber optic connectors and cables have been provided for single-channel applications, in which only a single conductor fiber is coupled from each of matting cables, and multi-channel applications, in which each of the cables contains multiple conductor fibers which are coupled by mating connectors. Terminal ends of the optical fibers contained in such cables are included within termini. The termini typically include ferrules which extend over the terminal ends of the fibers and which are aligned to align the mating faces of the respective optical fibers being joined. The terminal end portions of the optical fibers pass through the ferrules, and usually fit flush with terminal ends of the ferrules. When two of the cables are coupled together, opposing ferrules are mated together in an abutting arrangement, with the terminal ends of the optical fibers coaxially aligned for transmitting light signals therebetween. The alignment between two of the mating ferrules is critical in order to eliminate transmission losses which occur due to diffusion and reflection of the light being transmitted from one optical fiber to another.</p>
    <p>In some single channel and multi-channel applications, light signals have been transmitted between opposing optical fibers using expanded beam type termini connections, in which the light signal from a first one of the optical fibers is expanded, or spread apart, and then collimated upon exiting a terminal end of a first one of the mating termini, and then is received and collected by a second one of the termini to focus the light signal into a second one of the optical fibers. Expanded beam type termini connectors have encountered losses in excess of <b>3</b>db, which is unacceptable in some fiber optic applications. The ferrules of the expanded beam type optical fiber termini have been coupled utilizing split sleeves. The split sleeves are each split along one side by a slot that runs the full longitudinal lengths of respective ones of the sleeves, typically parallel to the lengths of the optical fibers, so that the sleeve acts like a resilient, spring-like member to clamp down upon the exterior of the ferrules to align the two mating ferrules. The two mating termini are usually gimbaled at points which are spaced apart from the terminal ends thereof, such that the terminal ends of the termini are free to angularly move along arcuate paths which extend transversely to the longitudinal length of the sleeve and the light path. This allows the terminal ends of the termini, that is, the axes of the termini, and the optical fibers to be coaxially aligned when being fitted within the split sleeve. O-ring seals have been included to prevent contamination of the terminal ends surfaces of the termini. In some prior art connectors, O-ring seals have been used to seal against the respective ones of the termini, and also to simultaneously provide gimbal surfaces for allowing angular alignment of the axes of the termini, such that the terminal ends of the termini are aligned in parallel.</p>
    <p>Connection of male and female fiber optic cables in the field requires that the connecting fiber optic cables be arranged such that respective male and female connector ends of the cables are aligned for mating. The termini in the connectors are usually designated pin or socket, and can be fitted with springs on one or both. The distinguishing feature between a pin and a socket is that an outer alignment sleeve is associated with the socket and remains associated with the socket during normal mate and demate of the connectors, in which a pin termini engages within a socket termini. The male and female connectors typically have a respective pin termini or socket termini, and the connectors are connected to opposite ends of the fiber optic cables. Longer fiber optic cables may be used to prevent the higher transmission losses for connections between the cables by requiring fewer cable connections. If one of the longer cables has been laid out in the wrong orientation for connecting to an adjacent cable, then that one of the cables has to be gathered and then laid out a second time or a special female-to-female or male-to-male connector adapter is required to join two adjacent ends of the cables. Additional handling of connector ends can result in contamination of the termini, and use of special connector adapters results in additional line losses from the added fiber optic connections. To overcome this problem, hermaphroditic fiber optic cable connectors have been used to provide identical cable ends which may be mated together, such that either end of a first cable may be connected to either end of a second cable. Hermaphroditic connectors allow the fiber optic cables to be laid out without regard to the orientation of the cables, and also reduce line losses by not requiring special cable adapters for different cable ends. However, the termini in such connectors still typically remain either pin or socket termini, that is, with an outer alignment sleeve associated with one or the other.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>A multi-channel fiber optic cable connector is provided for coupling the terminal ends of mating pairs of fiber optic cables utilizing continuous ceramic sleeves to align the opposing termini of optical fibers included within respective ones of the cables. The continuous ceramic sleeves have internal bores which are slightly larger than the outside diameter of the periphery of the ferrules of the termini, providing a clearance fit between the continuous ceramic sleeves and respective ones of the termini. The termini are independently gimbaled, with gimbal points being disposed distally from respective mating planes between opposing terminal ends of the termini. Floating seal assemblies extend around respective ones of the termini between the mating planes and the gimbal points, and seal between the respective ones of the termini and an inner bore of the connector housing. The floating seal assemblies each include an annular-shaped, floating collar having an aperture through which a respective one of the tennini extends. The floating collar is free to move parallel to a longitudinal axis of the respective termini, but not transverse thereto. A first seal element seals between the aperture of the floating collar and the respective termini flange. The floating collar includes a face which extends transverse to the longitudinal axis of the respective termini. A second seal element extends around the longitudinal axis of the respective termini and is sealingly engaged between the radial edge of the floating collar and a seal surface of a shoulder of the connector housing.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>FIG. 1 is perspective view of a fiber optic coupling <b>10</b> which includes two fiber optic connectors <b>12</b>. Each of the fiber optic connectors <b>12</b> includes a connector housing <b>14</b>, to which is threadingly secured a coupling sleeve <b>16</b>. The fiber optic connectors <b>12</b> are hermaphroditic in that the mating connectors <b>12</b> are exact duplicates of one another, and the two identical connectors <b>12</b> mate with one another. The coupling sleeves <b>16</b> of each of the connectors <b>12</b> are threadingly secured to the connector housings <b>14</b> of respective ones of the connectors <b>12</b>. The coupling sleeves <b>16</b> are selectively adjusted to make one of the mating connectors <b>12</b> correspond to a male connector and the other of the connectors <b>12</b> correspond to a female connector to dispose one in a male mode and the other in a female mode, respectively. The ends of the connector housings <b>14</b> of respective ones of the connectors <b>12</b> each include an insert cap <b>17</b>, having three protuberant portions from which extend from a recessed face <b>19</b> of the insert cap to define a tower frame <b>18</b> and two tangs <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>. The tower frame <b>18</b> defines an outwardly offset face <b>21</b>, which is stepped outward of the recessed face of the insert cap <b>17</b>. The three protuberant portions <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> are arranged in an interlocking alignment with respective portions of a mating connector <b>12</b>, such that the two tangs <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> are disposed in a keyed arrangement relative to the tower frame <b>18</b> for fitting on opposite sides of the tower frame <b>18</b> of the insert cap <b>17</b> of the mating connector <b>12</b>. The tower frame <b>18</b> contains two apertures <b>24</b> for passing optical fibers, and aperiphery <b>26</b> which defines a recess <b>28</b> and exteriorly disposed side profiles <b>29</b>. The tang <b>20</b> has a periphery <b>30</b> and the tang <b>22</b> has a periphery <b>32</b>, with each of the peripheries <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> defining interiorly facing profiles <b>33</b>. The interiorly facing profiles <b>33</b> of the tangs <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> fit flush against mating contours of the exteriorly disposed side profiles <b>29</b> of the tower frame <b>18</b> of the insert cap <b>17</b>. Two termini <b>34</b> of optical fibers are shown disposed in the region between the insert cap tower <b>18</b> and respective ones of the two tangs <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>. A head of a screw <b>36</b> is shown extending within the same region. The recess <b>28</b> is fitted with a screw and is also is provided for receiving a second retaining screw <b>36</b> of a mating one of the connectors <b>12</b>. Two termini <b>34</b> (not shown) are disposed within respective ones of the apertures <b>24</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view of one of the connectors <b>12</b>, taken along section line <b>2</b>—<b>2</b> of FIG. <b>1</b>. Four of the termini <b>34</b> are shown for a four channel connector <b>12</b> of the preferred embodiment. The two retaining screws <b>36</b> are shown disposed at opposite sides of the face of the connector <b>12</b>. The profile <b>29</b> of the periphery <b>26</b> of a first one of the connectors <b>12</b> has arcuately-shaped surfaces which are configured for matingly engaging with the profiles <b>33</b> of the peripheries <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> of respective ones of the tangs <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> of the other of the connector <b>12</b>, for aligning the apertures <b>24</b> in the insert cap <b>18</b> of the first one of the connectors <b>12</b> with the termini <b>34</b> disposed adjacent to the tangs <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> of the second one of the connectors <b>12</b> for optically coupling the optical fibers of the two mating connectors <b>12</b>. Preferably, the mating portions of the profile <b>29</b> of the plug bodies <b>18</b> define an exteriorly facing, arcuately shaped sidewall surfaces <b>26</b> which mate substantially flush with interiorly facing, arcuately shaped sidewall portions of the profiles <b>33</b> of the tangs <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>, with a sliding clearance therebetween to allow the connectors <b>12</b> to be engaged and disengaged.</p>
    <p>FIG. 3 is a longitudinal sectional view of one of the connectors <b>12</b>, taken along section line <b>3</b>—<b>3</b> of FIG. <b>2</b>. The connector <b>12</b> has a longitudinal axis <b>40</b>. The connector housing <b>14</b> includes a sleeve <b>42</b> which provides a main connector body of the connector <b>12</b>, and is of a cylindrical shape which is coaxially disposed with the longitudinal axis <b>40</b>. The sleeve <b>42</b> has a threaded ends <b>44</b> and <b>45</b> for threadingly engaging the coupling sleeve <b>16</b> of a mating connector <b>12</b>, and an end cap <b>64</b>, respectively. The sleeve <b>42</b> has an exterior periphery <b>46</b> and an interior bore <b>48</b> which define two respective profiles for mating and coupling with other components of the connector <b>12</b>. The sleeve <b>42</b> has an annular-shaped shoulder <b>50</b> which is interiorly disposed to extend within the interior bore <b>48</b>, transverse to the longitudinal axis <b>40</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 4 is a top view of the main body sleeve <b>42</b>. The exterior periphery <b>46</b> of the sleeve <b>42</b> includes an annular-shaped protuberance which defines a fib <b>52</b> having an annular-shaped shoulder <b>53</b> which extends transverse to the longitudinal axis <b>40</b>. A slot <b>54</b> extends through the annular-shaped rib <b>52</b> to provide a window for passing a stop pin <b>62</b> through the rib <b>52</b>, to selectively non-rotatingly coupling the coupling sleeve <b>16</b> to the main body sleeve <b>42</b> when the coupling sleeve is disposed in a male position. Then, the stop in may pass through the slot <b>54</b> to pass through the rib <b>52</b> for moving the sleeve <b>16</b> into a female position, rotatable upon the housing sleeve <b>42</b> for disposing the connector <b>12</b> in a female mode for coupling to a mating connector <b>12</b> disposed in a male mode. A gland <b>56</b> is defined in the exterior periphery <b>46</b> for receiving an O-ring seal element <b>58</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring again to FIG. 3, the connector housing <b>14</b> further includes the end cap <b>64</b>, which is secured to the rearward end of the main body sleeve <b>42</b> by a threaded connection <b>66</b>. An annular-shaped lip <b>68</b> protrudes inwardly from the rearward-most end of the cap <b>64</b> and defines a shoulder <b>70</b>. The forward end of the cap <b>64</b> has forwardly facing annular-shaped recess <b>72</b> which defines a seal surface for receiving an O-ring <b>74</b>. The O-ring <b>74</b> acts as both a seal and a resilient spring when coupling sleeve <b>16</b> is pressed against it during connection mate-up.</p>
    <p>The coupling sleeve <b>16</b> has an O-ring seal <b>80</b> on a forward end thereof. The coupling sleeve <b>16</b> also has a hole <b>82</b> which extends in a radial direction with respect to the longitudinal axis <b>40</b> of the connector <b>12</b>. The stop pin <b>62</b> is press fit into the hole <b>82</b>, and protrudes inwardly into the interior of the sleeve <b>16</b> for fitting into the L-shaped slot <b>54</b> through the annular rib <b>51</b> when the connector <b>12</b> is disposed in the male mode (shown in FIG. <b>3</b>). The threads <b>84</b> are interiorly disposed on the forward end of the coupling sleeve <b>16</b>. A rearwardly facing interior shoulder <b>86</b> is provided for engaging a forwardly facing end of an annular shoulder <b>87</b> of the main body sleeve <b>42</b> when the coupling <b>16</b> is disposed in a retracted position relative to the main body <b>42</b>, which disposes the connector <b>12</b>, as shown in FIG. 3, in a male connector mode in which the coupling sleeve <b>16</b> is disposed in the male position. When the coupling sleeve <b>16</b> is disposed in an extended position (shown in phantom for the left-connector <b>12</b> of FIG. 1) to extend forward of the sleeve <b>42</b>, the coupling sleeve <b>16</b> is disposed in a female position; and the connector <b>12</b> is disposed in a female connector mode for coupling to a mating connector <b>12</b> which is disposed in a male connector mode (shown for the right-connector <b>12</b> of FIG. <b>1</b> and in FIG. 3) with the threads <b>84</b> of the coupling sleeve of the female mode connector <b>12</b> engaging the threaded end <b>44</b> of the main body sleeve <b>42</b> of the male mode connector <b>12</b>. The pin <b>62</b> is removed from within the slot <b>54</b> through the annular-shaped rib <b>52</b>, allowing the coupling sleeve <b>16</b> to move relative to the main body sleeve <b>42</b> such that the coupling sleeve <b>16</b> may be moved from the retracted, non-rotating position with the connector <b>12</b> disposed in the male mode, shown in FIG. 3, to an extended rotating position with the connector <b>12</b> disposed in a female mode, such as that shown for the left side connector <b>12</b> in FIG. <b>1</b>.</p>
    <p>An interior groove <b>88</b> is formed into the interior surface of the sleeve <b>16</b> for receiving a retainer ring <b>90</b>. When the coupling sleeve <b>16</b> is moved to an extended position (see the left-connector <b>12</b> of FIG. 1 for the position of the sleeve <b>16</b>), the retainer ring <b>90</b> abuts the rearwardly facing annular shoulder <b>52</b> of the main body sleeve <b>42</b>, and the threads <b>84</b> of the sleeve <b>16</b> engage the threaded end <b>44</b> of a mating one of a sleeve <b>42</b> of a second connector <b>12</b> to which the connector shown in FIG. 3 is being connected. The rearward end of the coupling sleeve <b>16</b> further includes a recess <b>92</b> provided by an annular-shaped groove formed into the interior surface of the sleeve <b>16</b> within which a wiper seal <b>94</b> is disposed for extending therefrom for sealing engaging against the exterior periphery <b>46</b> of the main body sleeve <b>42</b>. A groove <b>95</b> is provided for retaining a retainer ring <b>96</b>.</p>
    <p>A retainer assembly <b>100</b> includes a retainer body <b>102</b>, a wedge member <b>104</b> and a threaded nut <b>106</b>. The retainer body <b>102</b> is provided for interiorly disposing within the main body sleeve <b>42</b> and the cap <b>64</b>. The shoulder <b>70</b> of the cap <b>64</b> retains the retainer body <b>102</b> within the sleeve <b>42</b>. The exterior of the forward end of the retainer body <b>102</b> is threaded for engaging the nut <b>106</b> which, when tightened on the retainer body <b>102</b>, causes the conically shaped wedge member <b>104</b> to be pressed against the tapered inner surface <b>108</b> of the retainer body <b>102</b>. The wedge member <b>104</b> has a hexagonally shaped forward end <b>105</b> suitable for engaging with a wrench, which provides a means with which to loosen the wedge member <b>104</b> for removal. The wedge member <b>104</b> has a cylindrical hole <b>107</b> which extends axially through the body of the member <b>104</b> for the optical fibers to be routed through. The fiber optic cables used with the connectors <b>12</b> preferably include an outer jacket that covers inner members which usually include fiber elements made of a high performance fiber, such as an aramid fiber, such as KEVLAR™ or a high strength polyethylene fiber. When mounting the connector <b>12</b> to the terminal end of a fiber optic cable having multiple conductors, an end portion of the fiber sheath is entrapped between the wedge member <b>104</b> and the inner surface <b>108</b> in the forward end of the retainer body <b>102</b> to rigidly fasten the retainer body <b>102</b> and the connector <b>12</b> to the fiber optic cable. To remove the wedge member <b>104</b> from the retainer body <b>102</b> and from entrapping the end portion of the fiber elements between the wedge member <b>104</b> and the retainer body <b>102</b>, the hexagonal end of the wedge member <b>104</b> is loosened to free the Kevlar entrapped by the wedging action.</p>
    <p>A retaining groove <b>110</b> is provided in the exterior of the retainer body <b>102</b>. A rearwardly facing, tapered opening <b>112</b> extends to an end shoulder <b>114</b>. A seal gland <b>116</b> is formed into the outer periphery of the retainer body <b>102</b>. A seal member <b>118</b> seals between the seal gland <b>116</b> and a surface of the cap <b>64</b>. The seal member <b>118</b> is preferably an O-ring type seal member. The tapered opening <b>112</b> provides a seal surface which is engaged by a rubber seal boot <b>122</b>. The rubber seal boot <b>122</b> includes a forwardly tapered conical surface <b>124</b>, which slopes to narrow with respect to the longitudinal axis <b>40</b> in a forward direction. The seal boot <b>122</b> further has a rearwardly tapered profile <b>126</b> for engaging with the surface <b>70</b> of a conical washer <b>127</b> to energize the seal boot <b>122</b> to seal against the tapered opening <b>112</b> of the retainer body <b>102</b>. The conical washer <b>127</b> is sandwiched between the rear cap <b>64</b> and the boot <b>122</b> and has the purpose of acting as a friction reducer element so that the rotation of the tightening action of nut <b>64</b> on the body sleeve <b>42</b> is not inhibited by the increasingly energized boot seal since there is relative slippage between the nut <b>64</b> and the conical washer <b>127</b>. The conical washer does not typically rotate on the high friction rearward conical surface of the boot seal. The seal boot <b>122</b> further has a bore <b>128</b> for receiving a fiber optic cable, and an interior profile <b>130</b> with annular-shaped ribs for engaging against the outer jacket of a fiber optic cable.</p>
    <p>A split sleeve <b>132</b> is mounted within the sleeve <b>42</b> of the connector housing <b>14</b>. The split sleeve <b>132</b> preferably comprises two halves which are split in a longitudinal direction, parallel to the longitudinal axis <b>40</b>. The split sleeve <b>132</b> includes an interior profile <b>134</b> which defines forward tabs <b>136</b> and rearward tabs <b>138</b>, which provide coupling dogs. The rearward tabs <b>138</b> extend within the groove <b>110</b> of the retainer body <b>102</b>. An interior groove <b>140</b> is formed into the forward end of the split sleeve <b>132</b>. The periphery <b>142</b> of the split sleeve <b>132</b> has a shoulder <b>144</b> and seal glands <b>146</b> and <b>148</b>. O-rings <b>150</b> and <b>152</b> are disposed in respective ones of the grooves <b>146</b> and <b>148</b>, and are used as garter springs. The tabs <b>136</b> define a forward end <b>154</b> of the split sleeve <b>132</b>. Two access windows <b>328</b> (shown in FIGS. 14 and 19) extend longitudinally in the split sleeve <b>132</b>.</p>
    <p>The connector housing <b>14</b> further includes an insert assembly <b>162</b> which is provided in the forward end of the connector <b>12</b>. A rearward end of the insert assembly <b>162</b> has exteriorly extending protuberant lip portions that defines flats <b>314</b> which fit within the groove <b>140</b> of the forward end of the split sleeve <b>132</b>, and interlock with the tabs <b>136</b> of the sleeve <b>132</b> to secure the assembly <b>162</b> to the sleeve <b>132</b>. The insert assembly <b>162</b> includes an insert body <b>164</b>, a terminus retainer <b>166</b> and an insert cap <b>168</b>.</p>
    <p>A dust cap <b>170</b> is provided for threadingly securing to the threaded end <b>44</b> of the sleeve <b>42</b>. The cap <b>170</b> is secured to the connector <b>12</b> by a lanyard <b>171</b>. In other embodiments, a plug may be provided for securing within the forward end of the sleeve <b>16</b>, rather than the dust cap <b>170</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5 is a longitudinal section view of the insert assembly <b>162</b>, taken along Section Line <b>3</b>—<b>3</b> of FIG. <b>2</b>. The two tangs <b>20</b> preferably extend for a shorter distance from the face <b>19</b> of the insert cap than the tower frame <b>18</b>, as shown, providing clearances between opposing ones of the tangs <b>20</b> of the mating connectors <b>12</b>. The screws <b>36</b> also preferably extend from the face <b>19</b> insert cap <b>168</b> for a shorter distance than the termini <b>34</b> to provide clearance between opposing ones of the screws <b>36</b> of the mating connectors <b>12</b>. The insert body <b>164</b> has two threaded bores <b>172</b> (one shown) which are disposed 180° apart across the longitudinal axis <b>40</b>, on opposite sides of the insert body <b>164</b>. A threaded shank <b>174</b> of the two captive retaining screws <b>36</b> (one shown) extend within the threaded bore <b>172</b> to secure the insert cap <b>168</b> to the insert body <b>164</b>. The two screws <b>36</b> may be removed from the hole <b>172</b>, and then the insert cap <b>168</b> may be removed from the insert body <b>164</b>. A seal gland <b>176</b> extends into an exterior periphery of the insert body <b>164</b> for receiving an O-ring seal element <b>178</b>. An exterior profile <b>180</b> defines flats <b>314</b> and lip portions <b>318</b> (also shown in FIG. 13) that mate with the tabs <b>136</b> of the split sleeve <b>132</b> (shown in FIG. <b>3</b>). Four bores <b>188</b> (one shown) extend through the insert body <b>164</b> for receiving respective ones of the termini <b>34</b>.</p>
    <p>The termini retainer <b>166</b> includes four bores <b>190</b> (one shown) and four slots <b>198</b> are shown) for entrapping the rearward ends of the termini <b>34</b> through respective ones of the bores <b>188</b>. (See also FIG. <b>6</b>). The bores <b>188</b> and <b>190</b> have longitudinal axes <b>186</b>, which are parallel to the longitudinal axis <b>40</b>. The rearward-most end of the bores <b>190</b> have a tapered surface <b>192</b>, which widens in a rearward direction relative to the longitudinal axis <b>40</b>. Forward portions <b>194</b> of the bores <b>190</b> provide cylindrical surfaces. The forward face <b>196</b> of the retainer <b>166</b> provides an annular retainer shoulder for retaining one of the termini <b>34</b> within the insert assembly <b>162</b>. Each of the termini <b>34</b> is passed through a respective one of the slots <b>198</b> and into a respective ones of the bores <b>190</b>, and then four of the termini are inserted together into respective ones of the bores <b>188</b>.</p>
    <p>Also shown on the rearward end of the termini <b>34</b> is a crimp sleeve <b>195</b> (shown in phantom). The crimp sleeve <b>195</b> is preferably used for installing the termini <b>34</b> to optical fiber cores when the termini <b>34</b> are uses in panel connectors, which mate with one of the cable connectors <b>12</b>, and not when the termini <b>34</b> are used in the connectors <b>12</b> for connecting to the ends of fiber optic cables. When mounted with a panel connector, rather than to the end of a cable, the termini <b>34</b> are fastened to optical fibers within the panels by placing the high strength fibers, which extend around respective ones of the cores of the optical fibers, between the crimp sleeve <b>195</b> and the rearward end of the termini <b>34</b>. Crimp grooves are formed into the rearward end of the termini <b>34</b>, such that the crimp grooves extend circumferentially around the exterior periphery of the rearward end of the termini <b>34</b>, and the high strength fibers are rigidly secured by crimping the crimp sleeve <b>195</b> against the crimp grooves with the high strength fibers therebetween.</p>
    <p>The insert cap <b>168</b> includes two bores <b>202</b> (one shown) and two bores <b>203</b> (one shown) for receiving various ones of the termini <b>34</b>. The shoulder <b>204</b> is provided in the forward end of the bore <b>202</b> for retaining an alignment sleeve <b>212</b> within the bore <b>202</b> of the insert cap <b>168</b>. A rearwardly facing shoulder <b>206</b> of the insert cap <b>168</b> engages a forward facing portion of the terminus <b>34</b>. The interiorly disposed surfaces of the bores <b>202</b> define interior profiles <b>208</b>. Two bores <b>210</b> (one shown) are provided for receiving the shanks <b>174</b> of the retaining screws <b>36</b>. The bores <b>202</b> and <b>203</b>, and the bores <b>210</b> align with respective ones of the bores <b>188</b> and <b>172</b> of the insert body <b>164</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 6 is a rearward-end view of the terminus retainer <b>166</b>. The terminus retainer <b>166</b> has the four bores <b>190</b> and the tapered portions <b>192</b>. Four slots <b>198</b> extend from the edges of the outer periphery of the retainer <b>166</b> and connect with the bores <b>190</b>, for sliding the pin bodies <b>216</b> of the termini <b>34</b> into the bores <b>190</b>. The four bores <b>190</b> and the four slots <b>198</b> are each angularly displaced equal angular distances around the longitudinal axis <b>40</b>, preferably having center lines which are ninety degrees apart. The four slots <b>198</b> are angularly disposed around the axis <b>40</b> such that they align with respective ones of the bores <b>190</b>, and preferably have widths which are the same size as and align with the diameters of the bores <b>190</b>. An alignment hole <b>200</b> is provided for receiving an alignment pin <b>317</b> (shown in FIG. 12) to prevent rotation of the terminus retainer <b>166</b> relative to the insert body <b>164</b>.

The one of the termini <b>34</b> is shown mounted on the terminal end of an optical fiber <b>214</b>, and includes a pin body <b>216</b> and a ferrule <b>218</b>. Each of the termini <b>34</b> has a longitudinal axis <b>220</b> which preferably extends substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis <b>40</b> of the connector <b>12</b> (shown in FIG. <b>3</b>). The pin body <b>216</b> has a longitudinally extending bore <b>222</b> and a forwardly disposed counter bore <b>224</b>, which are concentric with the longitudinal axis <b>220</b>. The bore <b>222</b> is sized for receiving the optical fiber <b>214</b> and the clad which extends around the core defined by the fiber <b>214</b>. The ferrule <b>218</b> is rigidly secured in the forwardly disposed bore <b>224</b>. An annular groove <b>226</b> extends into an exterior surface of the pin body <b>216</b> for receiving a retaining ring <b>228</b>.</p>
    <p>A retaining collar <b>230</b> is secured around an exterior <b>232</b> of the pin body <b>216</b>. The retaining collar <b>230</b> is secured in the bore <b>188</b> of the insert body <b>164</b> by the terminus retainer <b>166</b>. The retaining collar <b>230</b> has an inner profile <b>234</b> defined by a tapered surface <b>236</b> and a tapered surface <b>238</b>, which each taper toward the center of the retaining collar <b>230</b>, such that the surface <b>236</b> and the surface <b>238</b> are wider at the outward ends. A protuberance <b>240</b> extends interiorly within the retaining collar <b>230</b>, disposed between the tapered surface <b>236</b> and the tapered surface <b>238</b>. The annular-shaped protuberance <b>240</b> defines an annular-shaped gimbal ring surface.

An annular-shaped rib <b>244</b> extends from the exterior periphery <b>232</b> on the forward end of the pin body <b>216</b>. The forward end of the annular-shaped rib <b>244</b> defines a shoulder <b>270</b> which engages the rearward facing shoulder <b>206</b> of the insert cap <b>168</b> (shown in FIG. 5) to retain the termini <b>34</b> within respective ones of the bores <b>188</b> (shown in FIG. <b>5</b>).</p>
    <p>The ferrule <b>218</b> has a cylindrically-shaped periphery <b>272</b> and a forward contact surface <b>274</b>. Preferably, the forward contact surface <b>274</b> of the ferrule <b>218</b> is slightly rounded in a central region, and has rounded edges with a sharper curvature on the edge than the slight of the central region. In other embodiments, the central region of the forward contact surface may be a fully planer surface. In some such embodiments, the surface of the central region may also be disposed at an angle, such as <b>10</b> degrees, to a plane that is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis <b>220</b>. The ferrule has a central bore <b>276</b> for receiving the core of the optical fiber <b>214</b>. A tapered entrance <b>278</b> is provided which tapers such that it widens as it in a rearward direction. A coil spring <b>246</b> extends around the exterior of the pin body <b>216</b>, between the forward end of the retaining collar <b>230</b> and a rearward end of a floating seal <b>252</b>.</p>
    <p>The floating seal <b>252</b> includes an annular ring <b>253</b> and a floating collar <b>254</b> which slidably extend around over the pin body <b>216</b>. The annular ring <b>253</b> is preferably a flat washer. In some embodiments, the annular ring <b>253</b> may be omitted, but is provided herein to prevent a spring <b>246</b> from jamming between the pin body <b>216</b> and the floating collar <b>254</b>. The floating collar <b>254</b> is annular-shaped, and preferably has a U-shaped cross-section and an interior bore <b>248</b> which may move longitudinally along the pin body <b>216</b>, parallel to the longitudinal axis <b>220</b>. The movement of the floating collar <b>254</b> in a direction transverse to the longitudinal axis <b>220</b> is limited by both a clearance fit between the interior bore <b>248</b> and the periphery of the pin body <b>216</b>, and the clearance between the outside diameter of the floating collar <b>254</b> and the bore <b>188</b> of the insert body <b>164</b> (shown in FIG. <b>5</b>). The collar <b>254</b> includes a rearwardly facing shoulder <b>256</b> and a cylindrical, exterior-facing seal surface <b>258</b>. A forward face of the collar <b>254</b> defines a forwardly facing seal surface <b>260</b>. A rearward facing shoulder of the annular-shaped rib <b>244</b> defines a seal surface <b>262</b>. An O-ring seal element <b>264</b> sealingly engages between the seal surface <b>258</b> and one of the interior bores <b>188</b> of the insert body <b>164</b> (shown in FIG. <b>5</b>). An O-ring seal element <b>266</b> sealingly engages between the seal surface <b>260</b> and the seal surface <b>262</b>. The width of the seal gland, which is defined by the distances between the seal surfaces <b>260</b> and <b>262</b>, is determined by the length of an annular-shaped shoulder <b>265</b> of the pin body <b>216</b>, which determines the squeeze applied to the O-ring seal element <b>266</b>. The collar <b>254</b> is preferably sized to have a predetermined clearance fit with the bore <b>188</b> of the insert body <b>164</b> (shown in FIG. <b>5</b>), such that it is free to move for only a limited distance in radial directions <b>268</b> with respect to, or transversely to, the longitudinal axis <b>186</b> of the bores <b>188</b>, as determined by the predetermined clearance between the bore <b>188</b> and the largest outer diameter of the collar <b>254</b>. This limited distance determines the range of the squeeze applied to the O-ring <b>264</b>, which seals between the bore <b>188</b> and the seal surface <b>258</b>. The range of squeeze applied to the O-ring <b>264</b> determines the energization for the O-ring <b>264</b>. The resilience of the O-ring <b>264</b>, which is squeezed between the collar <b>254</b> and the bore <b>188</b>, tends to center the floating collar <b>254</b> within the bore <b>188</b>.</p>
    <p>The spring <b>246</b> presses between the retaining collar <b>230</b> and the annular ring <b>253</b>, and is shown in a compressed state after being compressed between the terminus <b>166</b> and the insert cap <b>164</b> (shown in FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>5</b>). The spring <b>246</b> presses the floating collar <b>254</b> against the O-ring <b>266</b>, to squeeze the O-ring <b>266</b> between the seal surfaces <b>260</b> and <b>262</b> (shown in FIG. <b>7</b>), thereby providing a biasing means for energizing the O-ring seal element <b>266</b>. The forward end of the pin body <b>216</b> is free to move radially with respect to, that is, transversely to the longitudinal axes <b>186</b> of the bores <b>188</b> in the directions <b>268</b> for distances determined by the clearance between the bore <b>248</b> of the floating collar <b>254</b> and the pin body <b>216</b>. Thus, the pin body <b>216</b> and the annular shaped rib <b>244</b> thereof may be moved in the transverse directions <b>268</b> relative to the longitudinal axis <b>220</b>, with the exterior of the pin body <b>216</b> pivoting about a pivot point defined by the protuberance <b>240</b> of the retaining collar <b>230</b>. The seal surface <b>262</b> defined by the rib <b>244</b> will thus move transversely to the longitudinal axis <b>220</b> and relative to the forwardly facing seal surface <b>260</b> of the collar <b>254</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 8 is a longitudinal section view of the alignment sleeve <b>212</b>, taken along section line <b>3</b>—<b>3</b> of FIG. <b>2</b>. The alignment sleeve <b>212</b> has a continuous, solid tubular body <b>280</b> which is preferably made of a rigid ceramic material, such as zirconia. In the preferred embodiment, the tubular body <b>280</b> is cylindrical and has a central axis <b>282</b>. The alignment sleeve has a bore <b>284</b> which has an interior profile <b>286</b> for mating with the peripheries <b>272</b> of two of the ferrules <b>218</b>, over the lengths of the ferrules <b>218</b> and the sleeve <b>212</b>, for aligning the two ferrules <b>218</b> together for transmitting light between optical fibers disposed in the bores <b>276</b> of the two ferrules <b>218</b>. The exterior periphery <b>288</b> is provided for mating with the profile <b>208</b> of a respective one of the four bores <b>202</b> of the insert cap <b>168</b>. Preferably, the profile <b>286</b> of the alignment sleeve <b>212</b> and the periphery <b>272</b> of the ferrule <b>218</b> are cylindrical, but in other embodiments may be other mating shapes for aligning the ferrules <b>218</b> of abutting ones of the termini <b>34</b> for transmitting light therebetween. Similarly, the exterior periphery <b>288</b> of the alignment sleeve <b>212</b> and the profile <b>208</b> of the bores <b>202</b> which extend through the insert cap <b>168</b> (shown in FIG. 5) are also preferably cylindrical, but may also be provided with other mating shapes for aligning and retaining the alignment sleeves <b>212</b> relative to the bores <b>202</b> of the insert cap <b>168</b>. The ends <b>290</b> and <b>292</b> of the bores <b>284</b> are beveled to guide contact surfaces <b>274</b> of the terminal ends of the termini <b>34</b> into respective ones of the bores <b>284</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 9 is a rearward-end view of the alignment sleeve <b>212</b> of FIG. <b>8</b>. Preferably, a cross-section of the tubular body <b>280</b> of the sleeve <b>212</b> is continuous, such that the tubular body <b>280</b> does not having either longitudinal or circumferential splits extending in the body <b>280</b>, wherein the periphery of tubular body <b>280</b> extends continuously around the longitudinal axis thereof. Thus, the continuous, ceramic, tubular body <b>280</b> of the alignment sleeve <b>212</b> is rigid, and will not easily expand or contract, exclusive of the elasticity of the material from which the alignment sleeve <b>212</b> is made, due to forces applied transverse to the central, longitudinal axis <b>282</b> of the interior bore <b>284</b> by the ferrules <b>218</b>, or by static or shock forces applied transverse to the ferrules <b>218</b>, as would prior art spring-type alignment sleeves having longitudinally extending slits in the sidewalls. That is, other than the elastic limits of the ceramic material from which the alignment sleeve <b>212</b> is made, the solid sleeve <b>212</b> will not expand as would a split sleeve made of spring steel.</p>
    <p>FIG. 10 is a longitudinal section view of two of the termini <b>34</b> which are disposed in a coaxial and abutting alignment for transmitting light signals therebetween. Each of the optical fibers has terminal ends <b>302</b> which are aligned for transmitting light therebetween by engagement of respective ones of the ferrules <b>218</b> within the continuous alignment sleeve <b>212</b>. The terminal ends <b>302</b> are aligned along a single plane of engagement, which is defined by an alignment of respective mating planes <b>304</b> of the terminal ends <b>302</b>. The mating planes <b>304</b> fit flush against one another and extend transverse to respective ones of the longitudinal axes <b>220</b> of the tennini <b>34</b>. In other embodiments, the mating planes <b>304</b> may be at an angle to respective ones of the longitudinal axes <b>220</b>. Respective ones of the termini <b>34</b> may pivot within the annular engagement points <b>306</b> of the gimbal rings provided by the protuberances <b>240</b> of the retaining collars <b>230</b>. The exterior peripheries of the retaining collars <b>230</b> fit within the bores <b>188</b> in a sliding engagement. The retaining collars <b>230</b> are retained within the bores <b>188</b> of the insert body <b>164</b> (shown in FIG. 5) by the annular shoulder defined by the forward face <b>196</b> of the terminus retainer <b>166</b> (shown in FIG. <b>5</b>). The forward ends of respective ones of the termini <b>34</b> are held within the bores <b>188</b> of the insert body <b>164</b> (shown in FIG. 5) by the shoulders <b>270</b>, which are defined by the forward ends of the annular-shaped ribs <b>244</b>, engaging the rearward facing shoulder <b>206</b> of the insert cap <b>168</b> (shown in FIG. <b>5</b>). The termini <b>34</b> are gimbaled for pivoting relative to the contact points between the annular protuberances <b>240</b> of the retaining collars <b>230</b> and the exterior peripheries <b>232</b> of the pin bodies <b>216</b>. The interior periphery of the alignment sleeve <b>212</b> mates with the exterior peripheries of the ferrules <b>218</b> of the termini <b>34</b>, in a slight clearance fit which extends around the circumference of the ferrules <b>218</b> and along the lengths of the ferrules <b>218</b> and the alignment sleeve <b>212</b>, which extend parallel to the longitudinal axis <b>220</b>.</p>
