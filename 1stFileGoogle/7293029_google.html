  <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0005">The present invention related in general to the field of automated business processes and systems therefor that match buyers with sellers of goods or services while also targeting marketing to such buyers. More specifically, the present invention relates to the automated methods as part of a workflow process that provide for the comparison and reconciliation of estimated data in actual data determined at the conclusion of an even in a multistage project.</p>
  <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0006">In today's complex, fast paced economy, many projects exist that require various goods and/or services to be provided by numerous organizations (hereafter, “sellers”) while also requiring relationships for providing and monitoring such goods/services to be quickly and efficiently established. Examples of such projects include drilling for oil, commercial and/or residential construction, manufacturing complex objects (for example, aircraft and special use objects), and providing specialized services (for example, brokering excess power and bandwidth, and developing unique software products). When planning such projects, the person(s) responsible for the project (hereinafter, the “buyer”) is often faced with the daunting tasks of: (1) designing the project and planning the phases of implementation; (2) determining which goods/services are needed; (3) determining providers (sellers) of such goods/services; (4) establishing a dialogue with such sellers; (5) selecting at least one seller to provide one or more goods/services; (6) starting, managing, and monitoring the project until completion or termination; (7) facilitating post-completion tasks (for example, paying sellers and other back-end processing); (8) analyzing the events of the project to identify areas of improvement for future projects and (9) other related tasks.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">Commonly, when faced with such a challenge, many buyers rely upon antiquated systems and processes for accomplishing those tasks necessary implement a project from start to post-completion. Such antiquated systems include, for example: utilizing business listings and other directories to identify sellers; negotiating agreements with the sellers via facsimile, telephone, and other non-real-time responsive systems; and making best-guess judgments as to areas in which future improvements may be realized. As a result, many buyers relying upon such antiquated processes are often left behind in today's fast paced, Internet-driven, information economy. As such, a system is needed that allows buyers to be efficiently matched with sellers, and projects monitored, managed, and coordinated through all phases of the project.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">For example, when constructing a building, a general contractor must decide which seller will provide excavation services, what type of materials to use, when the materials will be used, who will supply the materials, who will use the materials (i.e., who will actually construct the building) and other various factors. Currently, when constructing a building, the builder might use a Rolodex® or a personal data assistant (PDA) (for example, a PALM® device) with contacts to choose preferred sellers to provide the desired goods/services. Upon identifying a seller, the buyer may then engage in a dialogue with the seller about the project parameters, and may solicit proposals for methods to complete specific tasks. Since each seller may identify a unique manner for accomplishing the specified task, the buyer is often left to determine, for example, which seller has identified the best approach, will provide the best value, and can best meet the schedule. Since such determinations can be quite time consuming, buyers generally do not have time to shop for other than a limited number of sellers for any given project. As such, new sellers on the market, and/or new techniques may often be overlooked.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">Further compounding the problems faced by buyers in identifying and coordinating goods/services from sellers is that sellers often dictate the purchase processes used to acquire goods/services needed for the project (e.g., auction, fixed price and quantity systems, and other systems well known in the art). For some of these purchase processes, most of the essential terms of the agreement are dictated or controlled by the seller, while the buyer has little input over terms such as price, delivery, location, and quantity. Examples of such seller driven processes include retail, mail order, telephone, and some on-line sales systems. For example, a builder desiring to procure nails might be required by a retail sales process or an on-line sales process to purchase nails only in bundles of 200, for a set price. Since the buyer cannot modify the goods/services or terms or conditions of the procurement process, the buyer's needs are often inadequately, untimely, and inefficiently fulfilled.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">Additionally, recent automation of the aforementioned seller-driven processes (for example, via the Internet) has not adequately addressed this problem. While the new, automated processes generally enable a buyer to shop for goods and/or services, for example, without having to travel to the seller's location or obtain a catalog, such processes are commonly characterized by sellers offering items of commerce under seller specified terms and conditions. Such processes do not allow a buyer to identify a project in terms of its specifications, and have the specifications translated into requests for goods/services that are then fulfilled in a timely and efficient manner by a seller providing the requested goods/services or suitable alternatives. Additionally, such processes often do not identify sellers of specialty goods/services and, therefore, are often inadequate for the provisioning of goods and/or services that are not commonly mass marketed. In short, a more efficient process of matching buyers and sellers is needed.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">Examples of presently available buyer driven processes include bidding processes and auctions. Regardless of the process (whether bid-based or auction-based), a buyer is generally first required to identify specific goods/services that are needed to complete a project. None of the available processes allow a buyer to specify a project in terms of project details or parameters that are then automatically converted into requests for proposals, requests for specific goods, or other such proposals. Additionally, none of the available processes provide ready access to information to help a buyer, or seller, determine the appropriate details necessary to adequately specify a project or respond to such a request. As is appreciated by those skilled in the art, converting specifications for complex projects into specific requests for goods/services is extremely time consuming, is often incomplete, and is extremely inefficient because the buyers often can not precisely identify and/or specify those goods/services available and needed to fulfill a project. As such, today's buyer driven processes do not provide the degree of flexibility, specificity, and efficiency necessary for many buyers of goods/services. Therefore, a process is needed that enables a buyer to procure those goods/services necessary to undertake and complete a project by providing a project's specifications to an automated process that facilitates the conversion of such specifications into requests for goods/service and matches the buyer with sellers of such goods/services.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">Additionally, once an agreement has been entered into to provide goods/services needed to fulfill a project, systems are not available that enable both buyers and sellers to monitor the progress of the project, efficiently implement design changes, provide billing and other back-office functions, and determine areas for improvement by utilizing knowledge based systems. Thus, a process is needed that enables buyers/sellers to enter into agreements for projects and monitor such projects from initialization through post-completion/termination.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">Similarly, once goods have been delivered or a service has been performed, processes are not available that enable both buyers and sellers to efficiently compare and reconcile actual costs and project outcomes with the estimated costs and technical specifications provided by a seller in response to a service request, provide for a revision and approval process, and ultimately provide invoices that accurately reflect the goods and services provided. With many complex projects deliveries are made and services are provided in discrete stages over the course of the project. For example, a commercial response for lumber, for a particular project, may detail the various types, sizes, and pricing for the lumber while providing a final total price. However, the delivery may actually be performed in stages over the course of the project. These services are generally documented by delivery tickets or tickets provided at the time deliveries are made and services rendered. In other instances, ongoing services may be recognized by tickets submitted on a regular basis, e.g., weekly or monthly.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">Unfortunately, there is great difficulty in reconciling these tickets and allocating them to the appropriate project. Many times tickets are never received by the office accounting departments. For buyers, this means that they have no record of goods or services actually being provided. For sellers, this may mean that they are unable to or fail to invoice a buyer for goods or services rendered. Often it is a nightmare for buyer and seller accounting departments to keep track of tickets because proper routing and coding procedures often are overlooked in the field. As such, much time may be spent on the telephone attempting to contact foremen at job sites to confirm deliveries or services rendered or with the seller to determine to which project the ticket relates. Fraud is also an issue as many times false invoices are presented and paid under the assumption that the ticket was lost because it is too difficult or time consuming to identify the related tickets. Thus a process is needed to enable such reconciliation of proposal prices and project results with actual costs and technical specifications before approval and invoicing.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0015">At least one embodiment of the present invention is directed to a process and system that matches buyers (in exemplary embodiments herein “operators”) and sellers (in exemplary embodiments herein “service providers”) of goods/services based upon specifications provided by a buyer for a project. Additionally, various embodiments of the present invention provide a forum for the negotiation of resulting agreements to provide goods/services needed for a project, while also allowing buyers and sellers to monitor the status of the project and/or the provision of the agreed upon goods/services. Systems and/or processes are also provided which enable sellers to directly communicate with a buyer, including providing documents and other information that are readily accessible by the buyer, the sellers, and others (e.g., engineers, subcontractors, project managers, and other project members) from anywhere, at any time, via a suitable communications link. Further, the completion of post-task accomplishment activities, such as back-end accounting and billing operations, reconciliation of proposed costs and other data with actual costs and other actual data, invoicing, resource management, and knowledge management may also be provided by various embodiments of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">More specifically, a system and/or process is provided that, upon identification of specifications for a project by a buyer, generates one or more requests for goods and/or services needed to fulfill the project and provides the requests to those sellers designated by the buyer and/or those sellers that can provide the requested goods/services. It is to be appreciated that a “project,” as used in this description, includes activities involving single operations (for example, procuring casing for a well), as well as activities involving numerous operations (for example, building a house), and is not to be construed as being limited to any specific classes of goods, services, activities, or projects. In response to such requests, the sellers may submit proposals, request additional information, recommend changes to project parameters and/or the goods/services requested, and perform various other activities.</p>
  <p num="p-0017">When utilizing the systems and/or processes of the present invention, a buyer may specify one or more parameters that describe a project. Examples of such parameters include the following: physical parameters (e.g., size, weight, height); functional parameters (e.g., able to accelerate from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in less then 6.0 seconds); temporal parameters (e.g., to be delivered by Tuesday); financial parameters (e.g., to cost less than $10.00); transactional parameters (e.g., to be paid by check or money order); and/or geographical parameters (e.g., located in Colorado). The physical, functional, temporal, financial, and/or geographical parameters, or any other parameters that may be appropriate for completion of the project, are hereafter collectively referred to as “parameters.” Various embodiments of the present invention also enable users to compare various versions of a given proposal and/or different proposals for various purposes, for example, to manipulate the parameters in such proposals to ascertain different results based upon potential project outcomes. Thus, a process is provided which facilitates the matching of buyers with sellers of goods/services based upon project parameters, and not necessarily upon the specific identification of goods/services by a buyer.</p>
  <p num="p-0018">Various embodiments of the present invention further enable buyers and sellers to access industry specific information, for example, to assist them in determining and providing the necessary goods and services for a given project. A knowledge management system may also be included as a component of the invention and may be used, in one respect, as a library of technical information to aid both buyers and sellers in formulating and responding to various kinds of requests. Technical information may include, for example, industry data, articles, general engineering publications, historical or archived data, and data specific to either a buyer's or seller's projects or team (e.g., company specific data). As is commonly appreciated, company specific data may include operational and transaction histories for projects and other data. Access to company specific data may be restricted to protect proprietary information, or it may be shared, for example, as between joint venturers involved in a specific project.</p>
  <p num="p-0019">The present invention, in at least one embodiment, facilitates the sharing of such company specific data, as desired and/or permitted by individual companies. In many complex projects, various goods are delivered by a seller for use at various points throughout the project and documented by delivery tickets, even though the entire quantities and related total costs may have been indicated or estimated in a single technical and/or commercial response to the initial service request for the project. Similarly, services provided by a seller over the course of a project may be rendered and documented by what are known in some industries as field tickets. Rather than merely providing an invoice at the completion of the entire project, field tickets may be issued by sellers at various times during the project, for example, weekly, monthly, by hours expended, or by section completed.</p>
  <p num="p-0020">In one embodiment of the present invention, a system and/or process is provided for tracking, matching, comparing, reconciling, and/or approving for payment delivery tickets or field tickets for goods/services rendered at the project site. One element of this field approval of delivery tickets process may provide for communications between buyers and sellers that are directly linked to the specific delivery or field document in question. This process may be further enhanced by using an electronic version of a delivery document, one example of which is an eField-Ticket™ provided by WELLOGIX®, Inc. It is to be appreciated, however, that other versions of delivery tickets, in electronic and other forms or methods of communicating field or other conditions may be utilized in conjunction with the various embodiments of the present invention. As such, collectively and individually, delivery tickets, field tickets, electronic tickets, and an eField-Ticket™ are herein considered to be synonymous and are hereinafter referred to as a “Field Document,” or on the various WELLOGIX user interface embodiments as an “eFT,” in both the singular and plural context, as particular uses require. Further, it is to be appreciated that a Field Document may be generated, provided, accessed and/or utilized in a hardcopy and/or a soft copy embodiment. More specifically, a Field Document may be provided in a hard copy embodiment as a printed page, document, memo, report, invoice, Field Document or the like. Similarly, a Field Document may be provided in a soft copy embodiment as a computer data file, on a screen display of a user or a system device, as an audible text message or via any other known or hereafter discovered method and/or system for communicating information to a person and/or to a computer or similar device.</p>
  <p num="p-0021">Further, a historical record of the communications concerning the reconciliation and approval of payment for a specific delivery/Field Document may be provided to document and facilitate the process. In a related manner, actual project data (for example, quantities of lumber actually delivered, quantities of concrete used, time taken to drill a well to a certain depth, and other actual project data) can be compared and reconciled with amounts projected or estimated in technical responses to an original service request.</p>
  <p num="p-0022">In one business scenario using a system or process embodiment of the present invention, an operator may award a job with a commercial response or a work order. Once the service provider has completed the designated work or an identifiable portion thereof, a Field Document may be prepared and submitted to the operator for approval. This may be accomplished, for one system embodiment, by logging into an Internet and/or Browser based system, such as the WELLOGIX™ system, and communicating a Field Document (or an eField-Ticket™) to an operator.</p>
  <p num="p-0023">In another embodiment of the present invention, an offline manager feature may be utilized by which a service provider may submit a Field Document to an operator, or send the Field Document to another employee within his company via an online connection with an Internet or other network connected server/web site, such as one provided by WELLOGIX, or offline using an “Offline Component.” An Offline Component is herein defined as a web page that may be accessed even when a connection can not be established with a provider of the web page. An Offline Component has in some literature been called a “sitelet.” In short, utilizing the offline manager feature of the present invention, a service provider can prepare a Field Document either online, for example, via the WELLOGIX system, or off-line, for example, via an Offline Component. Further, when an Offline Component is utilized, the Offline Component may be obtained directly, indirectly or even sent to them using, for example, Consilient technology, Microsoft.net™, or other wired or wireless communication technologies. Further, it is to be appreciated that an Offline Component may be provided by other communication mediums including, but not limited to, via computer readable mediums, IR beamed signals, RF signals, fiber optic signals, and other mediums. When the service provider has inputted the desired data into the Field Document, the Field Document may be communicated to the operator, to another member of the service provider company, or to others using wired and/or wireless communication technologies.</p>
  <p num="p-0024">In at least one embodiment of the present invention, the offline manager manages Offline Components. Such Offline Components may be stored and/or utilized or created for a given project, for example, in a data array or other computer file data structure. The offline manager may also be configured to: 1) list Offline. Components that have been checked out; 2) list who checked out an Offline Component including, for example, a date and time stamp; 3) allow a user to cancel an Offline Component; and 4) list the type of Offline Component checked out. The offline manager may also allow a user, itself or others to cancel an Offline Component. The necessity to cancel an Offline Component may arise as a result of some particular business need. For example, an Offline Component may need to be cancelled when a first employee, who may be scheduled to perform work on a job site and is sent the Offline Component prior to leaving the office, is unable to perform the work and a second employee must perform the work in place of the first. In such a situation, the Offline Component may be cancelled, transferred and used by the second employee, regenerated or otherwise processed. The offline manager may also be configured to manage Offline Components that are currently offline, such that a user may determine whether any Offline Components require their attention.</p>
  <p num="p-0025">Depending upon their needs, different companies may use a Field Document differently. For instance, some companies may use a Field Document to capture rental equipment used at the drill site, while others may use a Field Document to capture detailed time information, and yet others may use a Field Document to capture payroll and human resources information. Therefore, flexibility in how a Field Document is designed may be provided so that a Field Document may be configured to display various types of information to meet the needs of different companies and/or users on a dynamic or static basis.</p>
  <p num="p-0026">To meet this need, one embodiment of the present invention may include a modularization feature, whereby the format of the Field Document is modular. For example, a modular Field Document may include multiple pages, instead of a single page, multiple sections, and/or other partitions. These partitions/sections/pages in a modular Field Document enable a company to customize Field Documents by using only those modules the company needs instead of having one long form of which most is not utilized. It is to be appreciated that a customizable Field Document may reduce the quantity and time necessary to communicate a Field Document between the field, the front office and otherwise. Further, when modular Field Documents are provided and utilized, the amount of customization that can be done for each company that uses an embodiment of the present invention may be improved. Also, the amount of time that development resources are allocated to build custom features within an application may also be reduced.</p>
  <p num="p-0027">In another embodiment of the invention, a modular data structure is provided for storing a compilation of actual data input to the system via a field document. A standard data array module correlating to a standard data input interface of the field document is provided. The standard data input interface receives input of standard actual data to populate the standard data array module. An optional data array module correlating to a respective optional data input interface of the field document is also provided. The respective optional data input interface receives input of optional data to populate the optional data array module. The optional data array module and the correlative optional data input interface are added to the workflow process as a conjunct to the standard data array and correlative standard data input interface.</p>
  <p num="p-0028">Another embodiment of the present invention may include a customization manager that allows for easy customization of various screens to better conform to a company's needs. Further, versioning may be provided, which enables users to retrieve previous versions of Field Documents and/or other information that may be utilized in a system or process implementing a version or embodiment of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0029">These and other features and functions of the various system, process and/or user interface embodiments of the present invention are further described herein with reference to the drawing Figures, the detailed description and the claims.</p>

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0069">A representative Internet or Web browser based embodiment of the present invention is depicted through a series of flow diagrams and screen shots of web page templates from an Internet based application provided by WELLOGIX™ and its predecessors WELLBID™ and eNersection.com. Those skilled in the art appreciate, however, that embodiments of the present invention and the WELLOGIX embodiment, in particular, may vary substantially or insubstantially in the features and functions provided by such systems without departing from, modifying, adding to, or deleting from the scope of the present invention as described herein and expressed in the claims.</p>
  <p num="p-0070"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> provides an information flow diagram depicting the various operations and processes of a WELLOGIX or other Internet or Web browser based embodiment of a system <b>100</b>, with particular reference to an embodiment designed primarily for the oil and gas industry. It is to be appreciated that this embodiment, and other embodiments discussed herein, may be used in other fields. More specifically, in this embodiment, buyers are generally large “operators” involved in oil and gas exploration and production. These operators procure goods, equipment, and services to drill and operate oil and gas wells from individual sellers, which are the “service providers.” For example, goods can include drill bits and concrete; equipment can include drilling rigs and transportation; and services can include drilling and cementing. Dashed line <b>160</b> marks the interface/integration boundary between those processes and/or services provided by the system <b>100</b> and those provided by an operator's system. Similarly, dashed line <b>162</b> marks the interface/integration boundary between those processes and/or services provided by the system <b>100</b> and those provided by a service provider's system. Also, dashed line <b>164</b> marks the boundary between operator accessible and service provider accessible components in the system <b>100</b>. It is to be appreciated, however, that these boundaries may vary depending upon the configuration and/or capabilities of actual systems implementing this or other embodiments of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0071">One embodiment of the workflow of a project proceeding through the system <b>100</b> may proceed as follows. An operator enters well project information <b>102</b>, preferably via an industry specific template for capturing project parameters, into the system <b>100</b>. The project parameter information may be entered by the operator manually, semi-manually (for example, by using drop-down menus) or automatically, for example, by uploading the information to populate the template from a system information database <b>114</b> (where prior projects may be suitably stored, for example, in a data array or other data structure), from an operator-side information source <b>104</b> external to the system <b>100</b>, and/or from other databases and/or sources of information. The operator-side information source <b>104</b> may include internal data created or maintained by the operator, data from any operator or third party application, and/or data from other information sources. Such data may also be stored in data arrays and other data structures. Additionally, such data may be stored as data objects in an object oriented database, such as one provided by Oracle®, and/or in a Structured Query Language format. It is to be appreciated, that these and/or other data structures may also be utilized throughout the various embodiments of the present invention. Further, in an Internet or other networked embodiment, data can be obtained from a variety of local and/or remote sources and that various third party processes and/or systems may be utilized, as necessary, to convert and utilize such data in accordance with particular needs.</p>
  <p num="p-0072">In the system <b>100</b>, additional workflow operations may be undertaken to identify and/or specify those parameters utilized to describe the project. Similarly, various parameters may be used to specify the configuration of particular project related tasks or sub-tasks, such as specifying wells <b>106</b> to be drilled for an oil and gas project. Utilizing project level and task/sub-task/well level parameters, the system <b>100</b> may be automatically, semi-automatically or manually instructed to transform these and/or other parameters into a technical request for quote <b>108</b>. In one embodiment, a technical request may be generated by populating appropriate fields for the project in technical request templates. The population of such fields may also be streamlined by utilizing data provided by other systems, such as, Knowledge Management (“KM”) systems.</p>
  <p num="p-0073">More specifically, information needed, desired and/or helpful to the preparation of technical requests may be available from several sources. Applications for modeling different aspects of a project may be made available for use within the system <b>100</b>. For example, in an oil and gas industry embodiment, an internal fracture design module <b>112</b> may be used by an operator to model how a formation can be fractured to enhance the oil or gas flow into the well. Further, parameters may be imported into such a modeling application module <b>112</b>, and modeling information may be exported and/or used to populate a technical request template <b>108</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0074">Further, the system information database <b>114</b> may also have a repository of industry specific parameters, information, references, links and/or addresses to providers of such information. The system information database <b>114</b> may also be part of a KM system, for example, one that automatically seeks out, stores, and catalogs relevant information, and further identifies particular information collected with particular operations, templates, or fields used to define parameters within the system <b>100</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0075">A third source of information for constructing technical requests <b>108</b> in the system <b>100</b> may be an operator-side information source <b>110</b>. This information source <b>110</b> may provide, for example, historical data captured by the operator, common project specifications and standards developed by the operator, and/or other internal or external information references. Information source <b>110</b> may also be a part of a single operator-side information source, such as one that includes information source <b>104</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0076">A fourth source of technical information support may be solicited from, or provided by, a service provider. A service provider may also use a technical response creation component <b>116</b> or a comparable component, for example, one provided by the system <b>100</b>. The service provider's technical response creation component <b>116</b> may access data and other relevant industry information from the internal information database <b>114</b> in the system <b>100</b>, from a service provider-side information and data source <b>117</b>, and/or from other sources of information. For example, in this embodiment, a service provider with particular experience or expertise could provide parameter information to help the operator develop a technical request <b>108</b>. In other instances, service providers familiar with the operator's projects may convince the operator to initiate a request for quote (“RFQ”) <b>118</b> by providing a technical response <b>116</b> to the operator indicating an alternative method of managing a project. Other types of complex projects, i.e., other than the oil and gas industry example, may have different components with greater or fewer operations or templates to adequately and accurately capture and describe the parameters of any particular project and convert those parameters into RFQs.</p>
  <p num="p-0077">Ideally, the RFQ is eventually communicated to appropriate or chosen service providers who may be notified <b>119</b> by the system <b>100</b> that such an RFQ has been made. The RFQ may or may not include any additional information or data attachments. In certain embodiments, all service providers or a selection of service providers may be designated to receive the RFQ. The RFQ, including any technical request <b>108</b> and attachments, if any, may be reviewed <b>120</b>, upon receipt thereof, by the service provider and/or other recipients and a response (i.e., a proposal) or an alternate proposal may be provided to the operator. For one embodiment, the service providers/recipients may prepare the response by exporting the data from the technical request <b>108</b> and any attachments to a service provider-side system <b>122</b>. The service provider may analyze and manipulate the data as needed using the service provider's own applications and/or other applications in order to determine and generate, if desired, an appropriate response. The service provider may also import data provided in the RFQ into the system <b>122</b> for integration into a response or proposal <b>126</b>. The service provider may also import other information <b>124</b> into the system <b>124</b>, for example, industry or company standards, internal or external references, or other technical or commercial data. Similar to the operator-side, the system <b>124</b> may be configured to translate data, as necessary, to populate those templates utilized and/or necessary to respond to an RFQ. Additional information may also be provided as attachments to the response, or provided as reference links, for example, hyperlinks, which enable an operator to access information directly from the service provider or from a third party source via an Internet or other network connection.</p>
  <p num="p-0078">The service provider may submit a completed response or proposal <b>128</b> to the system <b>100</b>. The response <b>128</b> may include a commercial response (i.e., one providing quantities, pricing, and similar transactional information), a technical response <b>116</b> (i.e., one detailing the service provider's rationale for the goods selected and/or a proposed method for providing the services requested), a request for more information and other responses. The system <b>100</b> notifies <b>129</b> the operator when a response from the service provider has been lodged. The operator can review the response <b>130</b> immediately upon notification or at a later time.</p>
  <p num="p-0079">At this point in the process, the operator has several options. If a service provider provides a suggestion within the response <b>128</b> that the operator finds particularly helpful, the operator may want to revise the RFQ <b>132</b> with the service provider's suggestion and re-bid <b>118</b> the project to all of the service providers. In another instance, the proposals may have additional attachments of data, information, or references. In this case, the operator may want to review <b>134</b> this additional information by accessing it from remote sources or processing the data on operator-side applications <b>136</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0080">Within the service providers' response(s), alternate solutions for completing the project may be offered by different service providers or by a single service provider. The operator may wish to compare these alternate responses <b>138</b>, if any, to determine the best method for completing the project. Alternatively, the operator may determine the best price between multiple service providers of the same goods or services. If an alternate response is particularly desirable, the operator may wish to revise the RFQ <b>140</b> with the suggestion and resubmit a revised RFQ <b>118</b> to the service providers. Once the operator has compared a desired portion or all of the possible proposals and alternatives, the project, or portions thereof, may be awarded <b>142</b> to one or more service providers. Financial information detailing the project award is preferably transmitted to accounting, sales, and other financial management systems of both the operator <b>146</b> and the service provider <b>144</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0081">As the service provider completes performance on the project, it provides actual performance data <b>148</b> to the system <b>100</b>. This actual performance data preferably includes both costs for the goods and services provided, and information about the conditions encountered that the parameters attempted to define. Actual performance data may be provided by service provider-side systems <b>150</b> such as accounting programs, and in the case of oil and gas projects, by entry into Field Document(s) (as described herein below in greater detail). More specifically, a Field Document attempts to capture and/or describe many of the actual results of a project, in terms of financial, functional and/or other types of parameters. In general, a Field Document provides actual data, measurements or observations taken during the performance of the project. Such actual data observed may be provided to the system <b>100</b> using wired and/or wireless processing and communications technologies. The actual performance data may be used to update configuration parameters <b>152</b> with the actual information to aid in the request process for future projects involving the same or similar parameters. This actual information or data may further be stored by the operator system <b>154</b> for historical reference purposes or otherwise. Actual cost information may also be used by the system <b>100</b> to reconcile <b>156</b> purchase orders, field actuals, and final invoices in order to facilitate the expeditious and appropriate payment of service providers by operators.</p>
  <p num="p-0082">In many industries, contracts for complex projects are often negotiated and entered into on a time and materials basis. Proposals from service providers generally indicate the time involved in providing necessary services and the quantity of materials they believe will be necessary to complete a given task for a given project. But, pricing is often based upon a per unit basis of time and materials. Therefore, the actual costs and fees incurred for a project may be higher or lower than the bid or contracted for price.</p>
  <p num="p-0083">For example, in the construction industry, a shortage of construction materials or skilled labor in a certain region can drive project costs beyond the proposal because of higher priced substitute materials or the ability of labor to demand higher wages. Similarly, in the oil and gas industry, a drilling team may encounter an unforeseen-operational problem that increases the time necessary to reach a desired well level, thereby increasing the cost of the project. In time and materials projects such as these, the operator typically continues to manage the project through its completion despite time and cost overruns. Through ongoing management of the parameters, however, the operator is able to make decisions concerning any available options to reduce the time and cost.</p>
  <p num="p-0084">Returning to the embodiment of the present invention shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the system <b>100</b> enables a user to immediately begin the invoicing process for time, services, and materials actually used in a job or event of the project. In many industries, a “delivery Field Document” provides evidence of the delivery of a certain quantity of goods to a project site. In the oil and gas industry, discrete quantities of services render are documented by Field Documents. In other industries, immediate documentation of goods/services may be called an “actual.” For the purposes of the function of the processes described herein, the terms “delivery Field Document,” Field Document, and “actuals” are synonymous. Usually a representative of the operator either visits or oversees the project site to ensure that the work is progressing and Field Documents are documented accordingly.</p>
  <p num="p-0085">At the conclusion of the job or a discrete event, the service provider's representative may prepare a Field Document detailing the actual work performed, time taken, and materials and equipment used, with the related costs and fees for the job. The operator's representative may approve payment directly from the Field Document or hold for payment until receipt of the official invoice. In many instances the Field Document merely operates as a verification that services have been performed, but not as a payment authorization. In the regular course of matters, there may be times when there is a discrepancy between the actuals reflected in the Field Document, the purchase order based upon the service provider's proposal, and the final invoice for the job. These discrepancies ultimately require reconciliation.</p>
  <p num="p-0086">The Field Document process is similar to the project management control process in the construction industry. Before submitting invoices to the operator for work performed on a construction project, the service provider's work must usually first be approved by the field project manager, or perhaps a government certification officer, to give the operator assurance that the work was performed according to specifications. Many other industries use similar controls for ensuring appropriate performance from service providers, and various embodiments of the present invention provide an environment for the management and transfer of such approval information and invoicing.</p>
  <p num="p-0087">Processing of a Field Document</p>
  <p num="p-0088">For the system and process embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, once a service provider completes a project, operation <b>210</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a Field Document reflecting the actual work performed, goods and equipment used, and costs thereof may be prepared. Desirably the Field Document is prepared using a system and devices which facilitate communications over local and/or remote networks, such as the Internet, a private network, a public network, a local area network (LAN), a wireless local area network (WLAN), a wide area network (WAN), or any other type of network, operation <b>220</b>. When the service provider's representative confirms the entries, notification that the Field Document is ready for review is communicated to the operator's representative, operation <b>230</b>. In one embodiment, the service provider accesses the Field Document via a wireless network connection from the field. In the alternative, if the project site is so remote that it may be impractical or impossible to connect with a wired or wireless network, the invoicing environment may be provided locally on the service provider's equipment and later interfaced with the system <b>100</b> when access to a network connection is available. The operator's representative, if present at the project site can approve the Field Document or negotiate changes before confirming the Field Document on the system. If the operator's representative is not at the project site, the operator's field and/or office representative may access the Field Document from the network once the Field Document is entered into the system. The system <b>100</b> facilitates the interchange between operator and service provider to reconcile any variances between the Field Document, purchase order, and the actual invoice(s) submitted by respective service providers.</p>
  <p num="p-0089">Once a Field Document is issued and approved, the system <b>100</b> may pass the invoice information from the Field Document to the operator's accounting or “back office” system for payment processing, operation <b>240</b>. If the Field Document is not approved by the operator's representative, the Field Document actuals may still be passed to the operator's accounting system. In either case, payment processing may then include reconciliation of the Field Document with the service provider's final invoice before payment is made, operation <b>250</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0090">Integration of Field Documents with Accounting and Office Systems</p>
  <p num="p-0091">Additionally, the system may be configured to integrate the operator and service providers' accounting systems. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, for another embodiment of the present invention, information transfers may occur automatically or upon command, for example, via a computer-to-computer electronic transfer, between the system <b>300</b>, the operator's accounting system <b>302</b>, and/or the service provider's accounting system <b>304</b>. Such information transfers may occur over any suitable communications network. Further, for one embodiment, the information transfer may be accomplished by implementing interface integration tools <b>306</b>, for example, Vitria®, Inc. software, in both the operator's accounting system and the service provider's accounting system. It is commonly appreciated that Vitria® software is designed to interface between large-scale enterprise resource planning software systems such as those provided by SAP®, JD Edwards®, and others. The system may also interface with such typical accounting software systems as QuickBooks® or Peach Tree®. However, the various embodiments of the present invention are not limited to the use of Vitria or any other software applications or systems and may be configured, as desired, to utilize any software applications which enable back-end accounting and business systems to interface and communicate data between operator and service provider systems.</p>
  <p num="p-0092">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the system may also be configured to reconcile <b>316</b> a Field Document against a proposal award <b>312</b> or other form of a purchase order. Further, the system may be configured to provide for manual, semi-automatic or automatic payment authorizations <b>314</b>. Additionally, the system may be configured to utilize interface integration tools <b>306</b> to match and reconcile <b>316</b> an invoice <b>310</b> against either approved or held Field Documents <b>318</b> and coordinate payment <b>314</b> from the operator's accounting system <b>302</b>. If the system is unable to reconcile a Field Document with an invoice or purchase order, the system may also be configured to flag the Field Document for review and approvals before payment is made and/or other project related tasks are accomplished. As such, this embodiment facilitates the early and often reconciling and approval of Field Documents such that work discrepancies can be timely addressed and delays in the project minimized.</p>
  <p num="p-0093">Pre-population of Field Documents</p>
  <p num="p-0094">A method by which one embodiment of a workflow system may pre-populate a Field Document and submit a Field Document to an operator is detailed in the flow diagrams of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. As shown, the method preferably begins when a user accesses a bid award page for a particular commercial response (operation <b>400</b>). The bid award page generally includes project level information, parameters associated with a specific bid proposal, commercial response information, and links, if any, to submitted Field Documents (operation <b>402</b>). When a user selects a link to a specific Field Document summary page for the commercial response (operation <b>404</b>), the system displays a summary page listing those Field Documents previously created for that commercial response (operation <b>406</b>), if any. If the user selects an option for creating a new Field Document (operation <b>408</b>), the system queries whether any old/existing Field Documents exist (operation <b>410</b>). If there are any old Field Documents, the system queries the user as to whether to pre-populate the new Field Document with data from an old Field Document (operation <b>412</b>). Depending upon the user response, the system may take several actions.</p>
  <p num="p-0095">If the user would like to pre-populate the new Field Document with data from a previous Field Document, the system determines whether multiple old Field Documents exist (operation <b>414</b>). If there is only one previous Field Document, the system automatically populates the new Field Document with data from the old Field Document (operation <b>416</b>). If there are multiple old Field Documents, the system determines whether the user has selected a particular old Field Document to use for the population data (operation <b>418</b>). If the user has not selected one of the old Field Documents, the system requests the user to select a Field Document (operation <b>420</b>). The system then queries the user as to whether the user wants to pre-populate the new Field Document with the identified old Field Document (operation <b>412</b>). If the user has already selected a particular old Field Document, the system automatically pre-populates the new Field Document with data from the selected old Field Document (operation <b>422</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0096">If the user does not wish to pre-populate the new Field Document with data from an old Field Document, the system determines whether data from a commercial response can be used to populate the new Field Document (operation <b>424</b>). If data exists, the system queries the user as to whether to populate the new Field Document with the data provided in the commercial response. (operation <b>426</b>). If pre-population is not desired, the system generates and displays a blank Field Document for manual population by the user (operation <b>428</b>). On the other hand, if the user does want to populate the new Field Document with data obtained from the commercial response, the system will automatically populate the new Field Document (operation <b>430</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0097">Once the new Field Document has been pre-populated with previously collected data or newly populated, the user may make changes to such data, as desired. After any additions or changes have been made by the user, if any, the system stores the data (operation <b>432</b>). The system calculates a total cost for the services performed and any goods/products used and enters a total on the new Field Document (operation <b>434</b>). If the service provider adds any comments or additional information to the Field Document, such information may also be stored with the Field Document (operation <b>436</b>). The system saves the new Field Document on a workflow system, such as a system embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The new Field Document, generally, may be accessed through the system by others (operation <b>438</b>). The system may also be configured to notify the user of the ability to attach files and other information to the new Field Document. Such attachments may provide, for example, supporting documentation or data for review by the operator (operation <b>440</b>). At this point or at other times, the system may be configured to perform a query to determine whether any files have been attached (operation <b>442</b>). If so, the system may store the files to the workflow platform or other systems and provide links between the files and the new Field Document (operation <b>444</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0098">The system also queries whether the new Field Document is ready for submission to the operator (operation <b>446</b>). If so, the system notifies the operator that a new Field Document is available for review (operation <b>448</b>). If the service provider is not ready for the new Field Document to be submitted to the operator for review, the system may be configured to not notify the operator or otherwise make the new Field Document available for review and to indicate that the Field Document is still a draft (operation <b>450</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0099">Generation of New Field Documents</p>
  <p num="p-0100">In a similar manner, one embodiment of the present invention may provide a system which facilitates the generation of a new Field Document based upon a work order. Generally, pre-population of Field Document is not possible when a work order is the basis for the Field Document. This condition generally exists because work orders usually relate to needs that arise in the field and are only partially, if at all, addressed in the terms of a commercial response. As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, upon a user selecting a link to a Field Document summary page for a work order (operation <b>500</b>), the system may be configured to present a summary page providing a listing of those Field Documents, if any, previously created for a specific work order (operation <b>502</b>). Upon the user selecting an option for creating a new Field Document (operation <b>504</b>), the system determines whether an old Field Document exists (operation <b>506</b>). If an old Field Document exists, the system queries the user as to whether the user desires to pre-populate the new Field Document (operation <b>508</b>). Depending upon the user response, the system may take several actions.</p>
  <p num="p-0101">If the user desires to pre-populate the new Field Document, the system determines whether multiple old Field Documents exist (operation <b>510</b>). If only one old Field Document exists, the system populates the new Field Document with data from the old Field Document (operation <b>512</b>). If multiple old Field Documents exist, the system queries the user as to whether to use data in a particular old Field Document to populate the new Field Document (operation <b>514</b>). If the user does not select one of the old Field Documents, the system prompts the user to make a selection (operation <b>515</b>). The system then queries the user as to whether the user wants to pre-populate the new Field Document with data from an old Field Document (operation <b>508</b>). Referring again to operation <b>514</b>, if the user has selected an old Field Document, the system automatically pre-populates the new Field Document with data from the selected old Field Document (operation <b>516</b>). If the user does not wish to pre-populate the new Field Document with data from an old Field Document, or there are no old Field Documents associated with the work order, the system generates and displays a blank Field Document for population by the user (operation <b>518</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0102">Once the new Field Document has been pre-populated or a blank Field Document provided with new data provided by the user, and after any additions or changes have been made by the user, the system stores the data (operation <b>520</b>). The system then calculates the total costs of services performed and products used as specified in the new Field Document or as otherwise specified (operation <b>522</b>). The service provider may also add any comments and/or additional information to the new Field Document, such comments and/or additional information may also be saved and/or stored with the new Field Document (operation <b>524</b>). The system saves the new Field Document preferably such that it is accessible, via the workflow system, by authorized users (operation <b>526</b>). The system next notifies the user of the ability to add file attachments to the Field Document to provide any supporting documentation or data for review by the operator (operation <b>528</b>). The system performs a query to determine whether any such files have been attached (operation <b>530</b>). If so, the system stores the files, desirably with the workflow platform, and provides links them to the via the new Field Document (operation <b>532</b>). The system then queries whether the new Field Document is ready for submission to the operator (operation <b>534</b>). If the user indicates yes, the system notifies the operator that a new Field Document is available for review (operation <b>536</b>). If the service provider is not ready for the new Field Document to be submitted to the operator for review, the system does not send notification to the operator or otherwise make the new Field Document available for review and designates the new Field Document as being a draft Field Document (operation <b>538</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0103">Reviewing Field Documents</p>
  <p num="p-0104">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, one embodiment is provided of a process for reviewing a Field Document by an operator after the Field Document has been submitted by a service provider. As shown, this process preferably begins with the operator receiving a notification that a Field Document has been submitted and is available to access and review (operation <b>600</b>). When the operator accesses a particular commercial response, at least one Field Document related to the commercial response is presented to the operator for review (operation <b>602</b>). Upon the operator selecting a particular Field Document, for example, from a summary list, (operation <b>604</b>), a read only version of the Field Document may be displayed for review by the operator (operation <b>606</b>). However, a writable versions of the Field Document may also be provided in alternative embodiments. If any comments are provided by the operator, these are suitably saved. Such comment may be inputted into a field specifically provided for such comments (operation <b>608</b>). Similarly, comments made by the service provider relating to the Field Document or otherwise may also be saved. Comments by a service provider may, for example, be inputted into a second input field (operation <b>610</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0105">Upon receiving an indication from the operator, the Field Document may be saved in a workflow system which provides to authorized users (operation <b>612</b>). While the save operation is depicted as occurring in operation <b>612</b>, it is to be appreciated that a Field Document may be saved at any time. Also, notifications may be provided to the operator that files may be attached to the Field Document. Such attachments may include, for example, supporting documentation or data for review by the service provider or other authorized users (operation <b>614</b>). Further, a query may be issued in order to determine whether any files have been attached to the Field Document (operation <b>616</b>). This query may also be repeated throughout the process as desired. If a file has been attached to a Field Document, the file may be suitably stored with links being provided, as desired, to the Field Document and/or from the Field Document to the file (operation <b>618</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0106">At this point, a determination may then be made as to whether the saved Field Document has been approved for invoicing (operation <b>620</b>). If the Field Document has been approved, the Field Document may be suitably designated as approved (operation <b>622</b>) and the service provider may be notified that the Field Document has been reviewed and approved by the operator (operation <b>626</b>). If the Field Document has not been approved, the Field Document may be designated as held for approval and the service provider suitably notified that the Field Document has been reviewed by the operator but has not been approved and that the Field Document is available for review, revision and/or resubmission by the operator (operation <b>626</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0107">Invoicing Field Documents</p>
  <p num="p-0108">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, one embodiment of a process for revising and/or submitting for payment a Field Document that has already been reviewed by an operator is provided. This process generally begins when a service provider is notified that the operator has reviewed a Field Document and the operator again accesses the related commercial response (operation <b>700</b>). When a user selects a link to the Field Document summary page for the commercial response, a summary page providing a listing of all Field Documents related to the commercial response may be provided (operation <b>702</b>). When the service provider selects a Field Document previously reviewed by the operator, the selected Field Document is suitably presented (operation <b>704</b>). If any internal comments are made by the service provider, for example, in a field specifically provided for such comments, these comments may be suitably stored (operation <b>706</b>). Similarly, comments by the service provider for the operator may also be suitably entered, for example, in a second input field provided for that purpose, and/or suitably stored (operation <b>708</b>). Further, changes, if any, by the service provider to the Field Document may also be temporarily or permanently stored (operations <b>710</b>). Once any desired changes have been made to the Field Document, the Field Document may be suitably saved to a platform, server or other system implementing this process. The saving of the Field Document may be accomplished automatically, on a periodic basis, and/or upon input from the service provider (operation <b>712</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0109">Further, the process also enables a service provider to add file attachments to the Field Document. Such file attachments may provide any supporting documentation or data for review by the operator. Such attachments may also, for example, be provided for invoicing purposes when the Field Document has been approved (operation <b>714</b>). Queries may also be accomplished, as necessary, to determine whether any files have been attached to a Field Document (operation <b>716</b>) and to save such attachments to a suitable system or workflow platform. Links between such attachments, if any, and the Field Document may also be provided (operation <b>718</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0110">At this point in the process, a determination may be made as to whether the Field Document has been approved for payment by the operator (operation <b>720</b>). If approved, a determination may be made as to whether the Field Document has been designated as ready for invoicing (operation <b>722</b>). If so, the data necessary to pay an invoice may be extracted from the Field Document and suitably communicated to a designated accounting and invoicing system (operation <b>724</b>). In certain embodiments, the process of communicating data to an accounting system may be accomplished via a network. In other cases, the accounting systems may be provided with a system implementing this process. As such, it is to be appreciated that local and/or remote systems may be used and interconnected in order to facilitate the before mentioned processes.</p>
  <p num="p-0111">Further, when the Field Document has been approved by the operator, but has not been designated for invoicing by the service provider, service providers may display and edit the Field Document, as desired (operation <b>704</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0112">Additionally, when the Field Document has not been approved by the operator, a determination may be made as to whether the Field Document has been or should be designated for resubmission to the operator (operation <b>726</b>). If not, the Field Document, and/or any changes thereto, may be suitably saved for later review and revision by the service provider (operation <b>728</b>). If the Field Document has been designated for resubmission, the updated Field Document may be saved for future access and review by the operator (operation <b>730</b>). Appropriate notification may also be provided to the operator regarding the availability of the revised and saved Field Document for further review (operation <b>732</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0113">User Interface for Generating a Field Document</p>
  <p num="p-0114">As mentioned previously hereinabove, various embodiments of the present invention provide systems and processes for generating a Field Document. It is to be appreciated that such systems and/or processes may generate various user interfaces or series thereof, including those provided audibly and/or visually, which users may utilize to generate, edit, review, revise and/or approve Field Documents. One such embodiment of an user interface is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8C</figref>. As shown, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, an user interface may be provided as a Web page which can be displayed on a Web browser, such as Microsoft' Internet Explorer® or Netscape's Navigator®.</p>
  <p num="p-0115">More specifically, one particular instantiation of an user interface, provided by a system implementing at least one embodiment of the present invention, that may be utilized to initiate the Field Document preparation process is depicted. In order to initiate the Field Document process in this embodiment, a service provider preferably accesses a Bid Award page <b>800</b> which may be configured to present Project Level information <b>802</b> as well as those parameters which relate to a specific request for which the proposal was awarded <b>804</b> (as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>).</p>
  <p num="p-0116">Further, this embodiment of a the Bid Award page <b>800</b> includes a View Field Document button <b>806</b>, which provides a hyperlink or other link to a Field Document. Upon selection of such button <b>806</b>, a user desirably is presented with a Field Document process page, at least one embodiment of which is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>. As shown, this page includes a list of previously created Field Documents <b>808</b> for a given project. Upon selecting a link to a Field Document item from the list, a previously saved and/or submitted Field Document, that has been prepared for a specific request, may be reviewed. Additionally, a link or button <b>810</b> may be provided which enables one to create a new Field Document.</p>
  <p num="p-0117">In another embodiment of the present invention, multiple Field Documents may be associated with a single commercial response. In this embodiment, multiple, discrete aspects of an ongoing, complex project may be accounted for at the time the service is performed, rather than having to wait until the end of the entire project. Further, by providing for the linking and reconciling of multiple Field Document(s) with associated commercial response(s), performance and budget issues may be reviewed as the project progresses. Additionally, since multiple Field Documents for a single commercial response may be very similar, this embodiment provides for the pre-population of Field Documents from several sources of data.</p>
  <p num="p-0118">User Interface for Reviewing a Field Document</p>
  <p num="p-0119">When a Field Document already exists for a particular project, a system implementing an embodiment of the present invention may be configure to present a service provider with a user interface which enables the service provider to review summary information relating to one or more Field Documents. An example of such a user interface is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> as a Field Document summary template <b>900</b>. More specifically and as shown, the Field Document summary template <b>900</b> may include a header which identifies a particular project for which one or more Field Documents have been submitted. In an oil and gas embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, the header may include the identity of the operator <b>902</b>, the project name <b>904</b>, the well name <b>906</b>, the hole section <b>908</b>, and the service type <b>910</b>. Further, the service type <b>910</b> may include a link which enables a service provider or other user to access additional and/or more detailed information about a parameter(s) of a given project. These fields may also be customized, as needed. For example, when well or hole section information for a discrete project is not available, the well name <b>906</b> and hole section <b>908</b> fields may not be shown in the header information.</p>
  <p num="p-0120">The Field Document summary template <b>900</b> may additionally provide summary information for existing Field Documents previously populated. This summary information may include, for example, a Field Document reference number (i.e., an EFT ID) <b>912</b>, the date the Field Document was created <b>914</b>, the name of the person who created the Field Document <b>916</b>, a functional link to access and review the most recent version of the Field Document <b>918</b>, the status of the Field Document <b>920</b> (e.g., whether or not the Field Document has been approved), the amount of charges detailed in the Field Document <b>922</b>, the estimated charges as originally specified in a commercial response, if at all, <b>924</b>, and a link to the workflow history of the Field Document <b>926</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0121">When creating a new Field Document, for example, when one or more Field Documents already exist, the Field Document summary template <b>900</b> may also be configured to provide the service provider/user with choices for pre-populating the Field Document. For example, in the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, the service provider is provided the choose of whether to: not pre-populate the Field Document <b>934</b> and instead manually enter new information; pre-populate from a commercial response <b>936</b> (wherein the Field Document is populated with information obtained from the commercial response <b>936</b> using a process similar to that previously described hereinabove with reference to when a user initially generates a Field Document); and pre-populate the Field Document from an existing Field Document/EFT <b>938</b>. As shown, the service provider/user suitably selects one of these options (or other options, when available), for example, by clicking a radio button associated with the particular choice. Additionally, if the new Field Document is to be populated by data from a previous Field Document, a radio button <b>928</b> associated with the particular previous Field Document may be selected to indicate the desired data.</p>
  <p num="p-0122">Further, by selecting a “Create New Field Document” button <b>940</b>, a new Field Document may be populated by the system. Also, when the “Reconcile Commercial Response and Field Document(s)” button <b>930</b> is selected, a system implementing this embodiment may be configured to generate a reconciliation tool template, one example of which is described in further detail herein below.</p>
  <p num="p-0123">The system may also allow one or more new Field Documents to be pre-populated when the Field Documents are based upon a work order. In contrast to a commercial response, a work order is generally a document issued in the field requesting a discrete project be performed that was not considered in an original bid request or commercial response. For example, it may be necessary to construct a fence around a project site to keep out unanticipated trespassers (perhaps cattle on range land). When a work order template is provided for a particular project, the service provider may choose a function to create Field Documents for the work order. Further, when no previous Field Documents have been created for the work order, a system, implementing an embodiment of the present invention, may be configured to create an initial blank Field Document, for completion by the service provider or others. For such an embodiment, generally, it is not desirable to pre-populate a Field Document(s) with information obtained from a work order because a work order is commonly a request by an operator to have services performed rather than an estimate by a service provider to provide such services. Or in other words, a work order generally provides actual costs rather than estimates of such costs, and thus, there is commonly no value obtained by reconciling a work order against a Field Document However, in those rare cases where a work order does provide an estimate, the various embodiments of the present invention may be suitably configured to reconcile Field Documents against work orders.</p>
  <p num="p-0124">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, when a Field Document already exists for a particular work order, at least one embodiment of a system of the present invention may be configured to present the service provider or others, via a suitable user interface, a Field Document summary template <b>942</b> which may be specifically tailored to a specific work order. The Field Document summary template <b>942</b> may include header information to identify the particular project associated with the work order for which the Field Documents have been submitted. As discussed previously with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, in an oil and gas embodiment, such header information may include an identity of the operator <b>944</b>, a project name <b>946</b>, a well name (if applicable), a hole section (if applicable), and/or a service type <b>948</b>. The service type <b>948</b> may also include a link to the work order entered by the operator which enables the service provider to access more detailed information about the parameters of the project.</p>
  <p num="p-0125">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, this embodiment of a user interface of a Field Document summary template <b>942</b> may additionally include summary information for existing Field Documents previously populated. This summary information may include, for example, a Field Document reference number <b>950</b>, the date the Field Document was created <b>952</b>, the name of the person who created the Field Document <b>954</b>, a functional link to access and review the most recent version of the Field Document <b>956</b>, the status of the Field Document <b>958</b> (i.e., whether or not it has been approved by the operator), the actual charges detailed in the Field Document <b>960</b>, and a link to the workflow history of the Field Document <b>962</b>, to be described in greater detail below. It is to be appreciated that additional or less information may also be provided, as particular implementations require.</p>
  <p num="p-0126">When one or more Field Documents already exist for a given project, the Field Document summary template <b>942</b> may also be configured to provide the service provider/user with various options for pre-populating a Field Document. These options include: not pre-populating the Field Document <b>970</b> and instead manually entering new information, and an option to pre-populate the Field Document from an existing Field Document/EFT <b>972</b>. A selection of either of these options may be suitably made, for example, by clicking a radio button associated with a particular choice.</p>
  <p num="p-0127">Additionally, when the new Field Document is to be populated by data from a previous Field Document, a radio button <b>964</b> associated with the previous Field Document may be selected by the service provider/user to indicate the desired data to be used in the new Field Document. When the create new Field Document function <b>974</b> is selected, the system proceeds with generating a new Field Document which has been populated by the system as desired by the service provider. A service provider may further select the reconcile Field Documents function <b>930</b> from the Field Document summary template <b>942</b> to connect with reconciliation tool template, which is described in further detail herein below.</p>
  <p num="p-0128">User Interface for Inputting Actual Costs in a Field Document</p>
  <p num="p-0129">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8C</figref>, <b>9</b>A and/or <b>9</b>B, once a service provider/user selects a “Create New Field Document” button <b>810</b>, <b>940</b>, or <b>974</b> at least one embodiment of a system implementing the present invention may be configured to present a Field Document template page <b>1002</b> (as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-10C</figref>). As shown, the Field Document template page <b>1002</b> provides an user interface via which a service provider/user may enter the costs of goods and services and/or other information related to a specific project request. More specifically, in the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-10C</figref>, project level information <b>1004</b> may be pre-populated into the template as may information obtained from previous proposals or purchase orders if any. Such information may be pre-populated automatically or upon request by a service provider or other users.</p>
  <p num="p-0130">Further, the template <b>1002</b> may be used to enter other information including, but not limited to, temporal information about the work performed on the project <b>1006</b>, descriptions and prices of services performed <b>1008</b>, descriptions and prices of products and materials used <b>1010</b>, and descriptions and costs of third party services utilized by the service provider in completing the project <b>1012</b>. The system may also be configured to total costs for the services performed and products used and to provide such totals in at least one field <b>1014</b>. The system and template may also be configured such that the service provider/user may enter any comments or explanations about entries and charges in the Field Document in a comment dialogue box <b>1016</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0131">Information entered into the Field Document template page <b>1002</b> may also be saved as desired, for example, the service provider may complete tasks and then record such tasks on the Field Document over a period of time by suitably entering such information and periodically selecting the save button <b>1018</b>. Further, when entries to the Field Document are final, the service provider may save such entries and simultaneously submit them to the system for review by the operator by selecting, for example, the “save and Submit to Operator” button <b>1020</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0132">Upon selection of button <b>1020</b>, for this embodiment, the operator may timely receive a message that a new Field Document has been prepared, which the Operator may access at any time. When the operator selects a given Field Document from the list on a summary page, the system may be further configured such that the operator may, for example, review the service provider's cost entries for the project and compare them to the original Bid Award amounts and any actual invoices received from the service provider. Further, the system and user interface shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-10C</figref> (or other user interfaces) may be configured such that when an issue or subject matter arises that the operator desires to share with the service provider, the operator may submit comments to the service provider/vendor in a field, such as the “Comments for Vendor” field <b>1022</b>. Further, this embodiment may also be configured such that the operator's portion of the Field Document includes an additional comment section <b>1024</b> in which an operator may provide internal comments, for example, comments directed to the operator's accounting department.</p>
  <p num="p-0133">As such it is to be appreciated that the system embodiment illustrated by the user interfaces shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A</figref>, <b>9</b>B, and <b>10</b>A to <b>10</b>C facilitate communications between an operator and at least one service provider. Such communications may be further enhanced by providing comment fields <b>1022</b> and <b>1016</b>. This and other information may be utilized, for example, to negotiate and agree upon a final cost figure or the like. Further, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A to 10C</figref> illustrate one embodiment of a user interface compatible with a system implementing the present invention. It is to be appreciated, however, that the operator's page may include additional buttons, for example, buttons, fields or other interfaces (all of which are well known in the art) which enable the operator/user to save any comments and submit them to the service provider.</p>
  <p num="p-0134">Further, this system embodiment provides that during any negotiation, a Field Document is “alive” and changes may be made to such Field Document by the service provider, the operator or other authorized users.</p>
  <p num="p-0135">When the operator and service provider reach agreement, buttons may be provided by which the operator may approve a Field Document while also submitting information on the Field Document to other interested parties, for example, an operator's accounting department. If the operator and service provider are unable to come to an agreement, the system/user interface may also be configured so that the operator may submit an unapproved Field Document which may include a hold for payment request designation or some other designation which indicates to an accounting department and/or others that a Field Document is not ready for payment. Further, once the operator submits an approved and/or an unapproved Field Document to an accounting department, the cost fields may also be locked by the system, while the operator and service provider may still be able to exchange communications with each other via the comment fields or other fields. Further, the system may be configured such that the operator may change any project level information and accommodate any other changes, if any, to the operator's internal project designations and record keeping. Thus, it is to be appreciated that the system embodiment as reflected by the user interfaces shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A</figref>, <b>9</b>B, and <b>10</b>A to <b>10</b>C may include many other additional features and functions and that buttons and other user interface devices (such as text entry fields, drop-down menus, and the like) may be provided.</p>
  <p num="p-0136">User Configurable Field Documents</p>
  <p num="p-0137">Another embodiment of a system for implementing at least one aspect of the present invention is illustrated through the user interfaces, screen displays, and/or templates shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-F</figref>, <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, the presentation of a Field Document may be modified to provide greater navigability and organization for the user. Each of the potential service and charge categories may be provided in a separate collapsible window or combinations thereof. For example, the service charges <b>1008</b> (in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>) may be collapsed into closed window <b>1102</b> (as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>) with only the total cost shown. Similarly, product charges <b>1010</b> (in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>) may be collapsed into closed window <b>1104</b> and third party charges <b>1012</b> (in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>) may be collapsed into closed window <b>1106</b>. Each of these windows can be opened to display a full itemized list of entries, as desired. Further, the system or software processes implementing this embodiment, may be configured such that each time a window is closed, the entries in the Field Document are saved.</p>
  <p num="p-0138">If a service provider desires to attach any supporting documentation to the Field Document, supporting documents may be attached after the entries to a particular Field Document have been saved by executing the “save” function <b>1108</b>. It is to be appreciated, however, for other embodiments, that supporting documents may be attached to a Field Document before or after the Field Document has been saved.</p>
  <p num="p-0139">Referring again to the system embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, once the Field Document has been saved, the system suitably presents an “Add Attachment” dialog box <b>1110</b>, on the service provider's template, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>. The system is preferably configured so that the attachment box <b>1110</b> function enables a service provider to attach any desired documentation (e.g., summary reports, core sample charting, and project designs), in any format (e.g., word processing files, spread sheet files, and computer aided design files) to the Field Document for subsequent review by the operator. When the Field Document is complete and any desired files are attached, the service provider may submit the Field Document to the system for review and/or approval by the operator, for this embodiment, by choosing the “submit” function <b>1112</b>. Upon submission of the Field Document, the system may automatically send notification to the operator that the Field Document is available for review.</p>
  <p num="p-0140">When the operator accesses the Field Document, the system desirably presents an operator's user interface such as the one shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>. As shown for this embodiment, the user interface includes collapsible windows, for example, the collapsed third party charges window <b>1114</b>. The interface also enables the operator to view a detailed enumeration of third party charges, by selecting the expand button <b>1116</b> which, as is commonly known in the art, expands a given window to occupy the entire viewable area of a given display. Further, the system may be configured such that the operator can view the entries and charges in a read only format. Read only formatting is preferably utilized so that the operator can not alter the information previously entered by the service provider. However, the system does provide the operator with the capability to enter internal comments about a given Field Document or an element thereof by including an internal comments box <b>1118</b>. Similarly, comments may also be directed to the service provider by making entries in the service provider comments box <b>1120</b>. Such comments to the service provider may be, for example, an indication of changes to the Field Document requested by the operator before payment will be approved. It is to be appreciated, that while the various embodiments of systems and user interfaces described herein generally provide for the entry of textual comments, the system and process embodiments of the present invention may also be configured to attach audio and/or video files, including audio commentary, to any Field Document, commercial response, work order and/or any other aspect of the present invention by which information is communicated between various parties.</p>
  <p num="p-0141">When an operator desires to approve a Field Document for payment, the operator may select the “approve” function <b>1124</b>, which function is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref> as being implemented by selecting an approve button. If the operator wants the service provider to make changes to the Field Document, for example, in response to comments entered in the service provider comments box <b>1120</b>, the operator so directs the system by choosing the “hold for approval” function <b>1126</b>. The operator may also save the Field Document template at any time by selecting the “save” function <b>1122</b>. Additionally, if the operator wishes to attach a document to the Field Document (for example, for review by the service provider), this action generally may be performed after the save function <b>1122</b> is selected, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref>. When the save function <b>1122</b> is selected, a file attachment box <b>1128</b>, similar to that provided to the service provider in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, may be provided to the operator with the same functionality of the service provider's attachment box <b>1110</b>. The operator may wish to provide updated, edited, and/or corrected versions of the attachments submitted by the service provider, or the operator may wish to provide entirely new attachments.</p>
  <p num="p-0142">When the operator selects either the approve function <b>1124</b> or the hold for approval function <b>1126</b>, the Field Document is suitably saved by the system and the service provider may be notified that the Field Document has been reviewed by the operator. It is to be appreciated, that a Field Document and other data or information utilized in conjunction with the various embodiments of the present invention may be saved in local and/or remote databases in data arrays, as objects in a SQL structure or otherwise.</p>
  <p num="p-0143">Desirably, the service provider may view the operator's comments when the Field Document is accessed. If the Field Document has been held for approval by the operator, the system desirably enables the service provider to adjust the Field Document and make any internal notes by providing an internal comment box <b>1130</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11E</figref>. The service provider may further indicate the changes made, or provide any other communication to the operator, in the operator comment box <b>1132</b>. Again, the service provider may save the Field Document at any time and return to it to complete the entries at a later time by selecting the save function <b>1134</b>. Selecting the save function <b>1134</b>, as before, also allows the service provider to attach other files to the Field Document (see file attachment box <b>1138</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11F</figref>). If the Field Document is ready for resubmission for review by the operator, the “approve” function <b>1136</b> may be selected.</p>
  <p num="p-0144">When the service provider selects the approve function <b>1136</b>, for this embodiment, the system may be configured to present the user interface shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11F</figref>. If the Field Document was previously approved by the operator, and no further corrections have been entered by the service provider, the system enables the service provider to send the Field Document directly to an invoicing program by providing an invoicing function which may be activated via the “Send to Invoicing” button <b>1140</b>. Further, if the service provider made any changes to the Field Document, after initial approval by the operator, the system enables the service provider to send such changes to the operator for approval before sending the Field Document to invoicing by providing the “Send to Operator for Approval” button <b>1142</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0145">In addition to the fields provided by the system for the Field Document, operators and services providers may also be provided user interfaces by which they may add their own, customizable fields to a Field Document. One example of a user interface for this customization process is the Field Document setup interface <b>1202</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>. By selecting the “add new custom field function,” <b>1204</b> an operator or service provider may insert a new field <b>1206</b> into the table, as shown. The custom fields may be labeled in any way desired, for example to keep track of particular account numbers or personnel responsible for a given Field Document. The custom fields may be designated as “read only,” “editable” by any party, or limited to “internal” presentation to agents of the customizing party by selecting either the read only function <b>1208</b>, the editable function <b>1210</b>, or the internal function <b>1212</b>, respectively. Once created, each customized field may be displayed as part of the Field Document template. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, operator designated custom fields <b>1214</b> designated as “internal,” and therefore viewable desirably by the operator only, may be provided below the internal operator comment box <b>1216</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0146">Field Document Management Tool(s)</p>
  <p num="p-0147">In order to manage a multiplicity of Field Documents associated with a multiplicity of projects, operators and service providers, another embodiment of the system may be configured to provide at least one Field Document management tool. An exemplary embodiment of a Field Document management tool is illustrated by the user interface templates shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A-B</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0148">More specifically, a Field Document manager template <b>1300</b> provided for an operator is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>. This template <b>1300</b> enables an operator to sort and/or search Field Documents by various categories. Filters may be provided in the Field Document manager template <b>1300</b> and may be used by operators to select the Field Documents to be displayed. Possible filtering criteria may include, for example:
</p> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0148">a) by service provider name <b>1302</b>, wherein the list of service providers may include all service providers that have submitted Field Documents;</li> <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0149">b) by project <b>1304</b>, wherein the selection list may include each project name for which Field Documents have been submitted;</li> <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0150">c) by well name <b>1306</b>, for example, when used in an oil and gas embodiment, wherein the list may include each well name for which a Field Document has been submitted;</li> <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0151">d) by Field Document status <b>1308</b>, whereby the Field Documents may be filtered by whether they have been received by the operator, approved, held for approval or have any other status; and</li> <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0152">e) by Field Document date range <b>1310</b>, wherein the filter may offer commonly used date ranges for selection, or allow the operator to enter a specific date range <b>1311</b> for Field Documents to review.
<br>
It is to be appreciated that other categories may also be utilized to filter Field Documents. Additionally, rather than showing only Field Documents related to a selected project, added functionality may be provided by allowing an operator to hide all Field Documents related to a specific project, for example, by selecting a check box <b>1305</b>. A similar option may also be provided with respect to well names, as depicted in the Field Document manager template <b>1300</b> by check box <b>1307</b>. Additionally, a particular system embodiment may be configured such that each filter may provide the option of displaying all Field Documents. If the operator selects “all” as the filter for the Field Document status filter <b>1308</b>, the date range filter <b>1310</b> will not be able to accept a specific date range <b>1311</b>. Further, the date range filter <b>1310</b> will show only Field Documents that have been modified to hold the selected Field Document status <b>1308</b> within the given time frame.
</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p num="p-0149">The Field Document manager template <b>1300</b> for a particular system embodiment, may also be configured to provide a listing of all Field Documents meeting the filter criteria. Preferably, such a listing is generated once the filtering criteria are established. But, the listing may also be generated as each filtering option is selected, it is anticipated that such “on-the-fly” filtering may enable users to detect subtle nuances between various Field Documents. The system also provides for the sorting of Field Documents based upon at least one of a plurality of data attributes, which may or may not be selectable by a user. For example, Field Documents may be sorted by service provider <b>1312</b>, project name <b>1314</b>, service type <b>1316</b>, Field Document status <b>1318</b> (e.g., whether or not the Field Document has been submitted, or perhaps has been approved or held by the operator), and Field Document approval date <b>1320</b>. Other data fields may likewise be used for sorting purposes as desired by particular system embodiments. The Field Document listing may also provide links to additional information associated with particular Field Document data, for example:
</p> <ul> <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0154">a) a service type link <b>1322</b> may provide access to the service request or work order;</li> <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0155">b) a commercial response link <b>1324</b> may provide access to a commercial response, for example, when the project was initiated by a service request and the service provider completed a commercial response; likewise, if the project was initiated with a work order a link may not be provided;</li> <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0156">c) a Field Document link <b>1326</b> may provide access to the most recent version of the Field Document and thereby enable the operator to approve, provide comment, or hold for approval a given Field Document;</li> <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0157">d) a reconciliation tool link <b>1328</b> may provide access to a reconciling process, which may or may not be an element of the system (one example of such a reconciling process is described in greater detail herein below);</li> <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0158">e) a collaboration link <b>1330</b> may provide access to a dialog interface where the operator may review existing messages or create new messages for the service provider regarding the particular Field Document or other aspects of the project; and/or</li> <li id="ul0004-0006" num="0159">f) a workflow link <b>1332</b> may provide access to a workflow history manager process (one embodiment of which is describe in greater detail herein below) which enables an operator to review significant changes that have been made to a given Field Document, by whom such changes were made and when such changes were made.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p num="p-0150">Additionally, the present system embodiment also provides a Field Document manager template <b>1350</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, for a service provider. This template <b>1350</b> similarly enables a service provider to sort and/or search Field Documents based upon various categories. Filters may be provided in the template <b>1350</b> and suitably utilized to select Field Documents to be displayed. Possible filtering criteria may include, for example:
</p> <ul> <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0161">a) by operator's name <b>1352</b>, wherein the list of operators may include all operators that have submitted Field Documents;</li> <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0162">b) by project <b>1354</b>, wherein the selection list may include each project name for which Field Documents have been submitted;</li> <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0163">c) by well name <b>1356</b>, wherein the list may include each well name for which a Field Document has been submitted;</li> <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0164">d) by Field Document status <b>1358</b>, whereby the Field Documents may be filtered by whether they have or have not been submitted to the system, approved by the operator, held for approval by the operator, approved by the service provider, sent to invoicing, or otherwise designated; and/or</li> <li id="ul0006-0005" num="0165">e) by Field Document date range <b>1360</b>, wherein the filter may offer commonly used date ranges for selection, or allow the service provider to enter a specific date range <b>1361</b>.
<br>
It is to be appreciated that other categories may also be utilized to filter Field Documents.
</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p num="p-0151">Rather than showing only Field Documents related to a selected project, the system may be configured to provide additional functionality, for example by enabling a service provider to hide all Field Documents related to a specific project, for example, by selecting a check box <b>1355</b>. A similar option may be provided with respect to well names and/or other fields, as depicted on the template <b>1350</b> by check box <b>1357</b>. Additionally, each filter may be configured (depending upon particular system embodiments utilized) to provide the option of displaying all Field Documents. For example, if the service provider selects “all” as the filter for Field Document status filter <b>1358</b>, the date range filter <b>1360</b> is desirably configured to not accept a specific date range <b>1361</b>. However, in other system embodiments, the Template <b>1350</b> could be configured so that an “all” selection may relate to certain sub-fields, such as “all” Field Documents generated within a particular time period, regardless of other filter selections such as the Operator Name, the Project, or the Well Name. Further, the date range filter <b>1360</b> may also be configured to list only those Field Documents that have been modified and/or to hold the selected Field Document status <b>1358</b> within the given time frame.</p>
  <p num="p-0152">The template <b>1350</b>, for a particular system embodiment, may also be configured to provide a listing of all Field Documents meeting the filter criteria. Preferably, such a listing is generated once the filtering criteria are established. But, the listing may also be generated as each filtering option is selected, it is anticipated that such “on-the-fly” filtering may enable users to detect subtle nuances between various Field Documents. The system may also be configured such that a Field Document listing may further be sorted by a selection of data attributes, for example, by operator <b>1362</b>, project name <b>1364</b>, service type <b>1366</b>, Field Document status <b>1368</b> (e.g., whether or not the Field Document has been submitted, or perhaps has been approved or held by the operator), and/or Field Document approval date <b>1370</b>. Other data fields may likewise be used for sorting purposes as desired by particular system embodiments. The Field Document listing may also provide links to additional information associated with particular Field Document data, for example:
</p> <ul> <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0168">a) a service type link <b>1372</b> may provide access to a service request or work order;</li> <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0169">b) a commercial response link <b>1374</b> may provide access to a commercial response, when the project was initiated by a service request and the service provider completed a commercial response; likewise, if the process was initiated with a work order, a link may not be provided;</li> <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0170">c) a Field Document link <b>1376</b> may provide access to the most recent version of the Field Document and thereby enable the service provider to submit, edit, provide comment, or take other possible action with regard to a given Field Document;</li> <li id="ul0008-0004" num="0171">d) a reconciliation tool link <b>1378</b> may provide access to a reconciling process, which may or may not be an element of the system (one example of such a reconciling process is described in greater detail herein below);</li> <li id="ul0008-0005" num="0172">e) a collaboration link <b>1380</b> may provide access to a dialog interface where the service provider may review existing messages or create new messages for the operator regarding the particular Field Document or other aspects of the project; and</li> <li id="ul0008-0006" num="0173">f) a workflow link <b>1382</b> may provide access to a workflow history manager process (one embodiment of which is describe in greater detail herein below) which enables a service provider to review significant changes that have been made to a given Field Document, by whom such changes were made, and when such changes were made.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p num="p-0153">Reconciliation of Field Documents</p>
  <p num="p-0154">Another embodiment of the present invention provides a process for reconciling a Field Document and a commercial response. This process may be accomplished by utilizing a reconciliation tool (which ideally is provided in software that has been loaded into a system implementing an embodiment of the present invention). The processes performed by an embodiment of such a reconciliation tool are depicted in the flow diagrams of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref>. It is to be appreciated, that for this and other embodiments, certain common processes may be made available to both the operator and service provider, such common processes are identified by operation <b>1400</b> and are further described in greater detail herein below.</p>
  <p num="p-0155">Initially, this process begins when a reconciliation tool template, which may be provided in an user interface or otherwise, is accessed by a user (operation <b>1402</b>). Once the tool is accessed, the user identifies at least one commercial response or work order in which they are interested in reconciling and a list of Field Documents associated with the selected commercial response(s) or work order(s) is presented to the user (operation <b>1404</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0156">Next, the process may be configured to present an interface from which the user may select which, if any, of the Field Documents on the list to reconcile (operation <b>1406</b>). Once a user's selection has been made, a query, may then be initiated in order to determine whether the user has selected less than all of the Field Documents listed for the selected commercial response(s) and/or work order(s)(operation <b>1408</b>). If all of the Field Documents have been selected by the user, the process continues the reconciliation functions using all the filed Field Documents (operation <b>1410</b>). However, if the number of Field Documents selected is less than the total number of Field Documents, the process continues with performing the reconciliation functions with respect to only the selected Field Documents (operation <b>1412</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0157">When the user selects the reconciliation function (operation <b>1414</b>), the process provides, for the selected Field Documents, data totals that are generally provided in reference to the discrete categories or fields of data collected in the Field Document(s) (operation <b>1416</b>). Next, it is determined whether a commercial response or work order is associated with each of the selected Field Document(s) (operation <b>1418</b>). If there is a commercial response, a system implementing this process suitably retrieves data totals for the fields of data in the commercial response which relate to fields specified in a given related Field Document (operation <b>1420</b>). It is to be appreciated that such data may be obtained from local and/or remote databases.</p>
  <p num="p-0158">Next, a comparison is made between the estimated data in the commercial response and the actual data provided in a given Field Document, or a sum total when data is accessed from a plurality of Field Documents. The result of this comparison may be provided as the difference between the values (operation <b>1422</b>). Additionally, a percentage difference between the values of the commercial response and the Field Document(s) may be calculated and provided to the user (operation <b>1424</b>). The process may then end or may continue with the user reviewing the comparison data, and/or selecting other Field Document(s) to reconcile (operation <b>1406</b>). Thus, it is to be appreciated that <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> provides one embodiment by which a user may select at least one commercial response and/or work order, identify Field Documents to be reconciled against the selected commercial response(s) or work order(s), and obtain value and percentage differences between estimates and actual work performed for a given project.</p>
  <p num="p-0159"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref> depicts another embodiment of a process for reconciling Field Documents. This process may be directed towards an operator, however, comparable processes may also be provided for a service provider. More specifically, this process begins when a user accesses an operator user interface provided by a system or device implementing an embodiment of this process of the present invention (operation <b>1426</b>). For the operator's benefit, this process may be configured to enable an operator to approve at least one Field Document for payment directly via a user interface which includes a reconciliation tool (operation <b>1428</b>). The user interface and this process may be configured to provide the operator with a template which enables the operator to choose between at least two input options. It is to be appreciated, that providing the option of to pay or not to pay via a reconciliation tool may be highly desirable because a result of such a decision will likely be based upon the results of the reconciliation of at least one Field Document.</p>
  <p num="p-0160">As shown, this process may also be configured to provide two function: an approval function, and a hold for approval function. When the operator selects the approval function (operation <b>1430</b>), the operator may be provided an input field (for example, on a user interface), by which the user may add comments or information to the Field Document (operation <b>1432</b>). Once any comments have been added (operation <b>1434</b>), or if no comments were added, the Field Document is designated as approved and is saved (operation <b>1436</b>). Ideally, the approved Field Document is saved to a workflow platform provided by a system implementing the present invention. Such workflow platform generally may be accessed by other authorized users at any time. Alternatively, the approved Field Document may be saved in other systems, as desired, and accessed via Internet connections or other connections.</p>
  <p num="p-0161">Once a Field Document has been approved and/or saved, a notification may be communicated to the service provider(s) associated with the Field Document (operation <b>1446</b>). This notification may be communicated via any suitable communications medium including, but not limited to, paging systems, e-mail, instant messaging, telephone messaging, teletype, facsimile, or the like.</p>
  <p num="p-0162">Referring again to operation <b>1428</b>, should the operator select the hold for approval function (operation <b>1438</b>), the operator may be provided the opportunity to add any comments or information to the Field Document before submitting the Field Document to the service provider for revision (operation <b>1440</b>). Once any comments have been entered (operation <b>1442</b>), or if no comments were added, the Field Document may be designated as “held for approval” and saved (operation <b>1444</b>). A notification may then be communicated to the service provider that the Field Document has been reviewed by the operator, designated as “held for approval” and is available for revision (operation <b>1446</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0163">User Interfaces for Reconciling</p>
  <p num="p-0164"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A-C</figref> provide an exemplary series of user interfaces/templates by which a service provider may utilize at least one embodiment of the before mentioned reconciliation process. Generally, the user interfaces shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A-15C</figref> provide a reconciliation tool which contains substantially the same fields and functions for both the operator and the service provider, since all but a few f the available functions of the reconciliation tool are provided to both parties. However, other embodiments may utilize user interfaces and reconciliation tools which may substantially vary from an operator's perspective to a service provider's perspective. All such variations are considered to be within the scope of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0165">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, Field Documents may be linked to a particular commercial response. The reconciliatory tool template <b>1500</b> <i>a </i>suitably includes a header section in which project specific information may be provided, for example, the operator (or service provider) name <b>1502</b>, the well name <b>1504</b>, and a service type description <b>1506</b>. Further, a table <b>1511</b> may be provided in which comparisons between the totals of various fields of Field Documents <b>1512</b>, for example, the different categories of charges incurred, to the related commercial response <b>1508</b> may be displayed. Another data field in the table <b>1511</b> may also include an indication of the status <b>1509</b> of the Field Documents <b>1512</b>, i.e., whether the Field Document has been submitted for approval, approved, held, or has been transferred for invoicing. Hyperlinks and other types of links may also provide a user with access to the most recent version of each actual Field Document <b>1512</b> via links <b>1512</b>′ and similarly to the commercial response <b>1508</b> via link <b>1508</b>′. Similarly, links to the original service request <b>1510</b> may also be provided to allow for review and comparison of all the project documents.</p>
  <p num="p-0166">Further, it is to be appreciated that access to Field Documents, commercial responses, original service requests and/or other information may be provided immediately or on a delayed basis, in accordance with particular system and/or user device configurations and/or limitations. For example, a user in the field may not have immediate access when communications links are inoperable between a user device and a system or database at which a given Field Document or commercial response is saved.</p>
  <p num="p-0167">The table <b>1511</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> may further include a Field Document total calculation column <b>1514</b> in which combined total amounts for each discrete data field of the Field Documents <b>1512</b> may be presented. These totals may be obtained using, for example, known in the art column adding formulas. The user interface may also provide a comparison between the Field Document total amounts <b>1514</b> and the commercial response estimates <b>1508</b> as both an actual comparison <b>1518</b> (the difference) and a percentage comparison <b>1520</b> (the difference divided by the commercial response amount <b>1508</b>). Again, such totals and percentages may be calculated utilizing well known in the art processes.</p>
  <p num="p-0168">In essence, via the user interface provided in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, Field Documents related to a particular service request can be presented to a user via one reconciliation tool such as the table <b>1511</b>. This feature of the present invention may be especially advantageous when Field Document submissions or receipts may never reach a service provider or operator's accounting department, the service may never be billed, or an invoice may be received for which there is provided no evidence showing that the work was ever performed. Further, not only does this and other embodiments of the present system keep track of all Field Documents issued, it ensures that they are tied to the particular service request. Further, via a reconciliation tool, such as the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, when multiple Field Documents are issued for the same service request, the Field Documents can be viewed together, along with the commercial response, to determine whether the Field Documents track the commercial response and/or whether there are discrepancies that require further investigation.</p>
  <p num="p-0169">Further, the present invention suitably supports reconciliation tools which enable a user to select which Field Document(s) to include for comparisons and calculations. Such functionality may be provided in various manners, for example, by a Field Document selection bar <b>1516</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, each of the Field Documents <b>1512</b> associated with the particular service request <b>1510</b> may be selected for display in the table <b>1511</b>. Similarly, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> depicts a reconciliation tool template <b>1500</b> <i>b </i>for the same service request <b>1510</b> wherein a user has selected only two, <b>1516</b> <i>b </i>and <b>1516</b> <i>c</i>, out of the three Field Documents possible via the Field Document selection bar <b>1516</b>. In order to update the table <b>1511</b> to reflect the selected Field Documents <b>1516</b> <i>a </i>and <b>1516</b> <i>b</i>, a “reconcile” function <b>1522</b> may be provided whereby, upon selection, the table <b>1511</b> is recalculated with only the selected Field Documents <b>1512</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0170">For example, when the first Field Document <b>1516</b> <i>a </i>on the Field Document selection bar <b>1516</b> is not selected, the data associated with such Field Document may be excluded from the Field Documents <b>1512</b> displayed in the table <b>1511</b>. Further, in this example, because only two Field Documents <b>1512</b> are provided in the table <b>1511</b>, the actual comparison <b>1518</b> and percentage comparison <b>1520</b> figures are different in this template <b>1500</b> <i>b </i>than in the previous template <b>1500</b> <i>a</i>. Such comparison information between estimates and actuals, between all Field Documents, or only a subset thereof, may be used to manage a project by facilitating determinations as to whether there are cost overruns or savings, or additional work is yet to be performed because the Field Document totals <b>1514</b> do not reflect the totals in the commercial response <b>1508</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0171">It is to be appreciated that numerous variations may be made to the reconciliation tool and how such tool may be presented to a user. One such variation is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</figref>. In this variation, a table <b>1511</b> may be provided wherein the Field Documents <b>1512</b> are related to a work order <b>1510</b>′ rather than a commercial response <b>1510</b> (as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>). The reconciliation tool, for this embodiment, may be configured to merely calculate the totals <b>1514</b> of the selected Field Documents <b>1512</b>. Since there generally is no underlying commercial response, there are no differences or percentages to calculate. Also, the user may be provided with the option of choosing which Field Documents <b>1512</b> to reconcile by using the Field Document selection bar <b>1516</b> and selecting the reconcile checked items function <b>1522</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0172">An embodiment of a user interface providing access to reconciliation tool by an operator is generally shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15D</figref>. As shown, this embodiment provides for additional functionality in the reconciliation tool template <b>1500</b> <i>d </i>Fig. In this operator embodiment, generally, most of the header information will be the same as that provided in the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A to 15C</figref>. However, the service provider information <b>1502</b>′ for the project may be provided instead of operator information <b>1502</b>. In addition to the before mentioned comparison capabilities, this embodiment may also be configured to enable an operator to approve Field Documents for invoicing by the service provider, or if there is some discrepancy, hold the Field Document for approval pending resolution of the discrepancy. These Field Document review capabilities may be provided by the approve selected Field Document function <b>1524</b> and the hold selected Field Document function <b>1526</b>, respectively. Further, designation of particular Field Documents <b>1512</b> for approval or holding may be provided by the selection of one or more radio buttons <b>1528</b> on the template table <b>1511</b> next to the Field Document number <b>1512</b>. Additionally, in at least one embodiment, the availability of radio buttons <b>1528</b> is related to the status <b>1509</b> of the particular Field Document. For example, if a particular Field Document has already been approved by an operator, then a radio button <b>1528</b> may not be provided for selection of that particular Field Document for approval or holding. Such selecting may be accomplished by selecting the approve selected Field Document function <b>1524</b> or the hold selected Field Document function <b>1526</b>. In short, this and other system embodiments may be configured, as desired, to operate with other process embodiments described herein in order to provide an integrated system.</p>
  <p num="p-0173">If an operator does select either the approve selected Field Document function <b>1524</b> or the hold selected Field Document function <b>1526</b>, a message may be generated inquiring whether the operator would like to enter internal comments or comments for the service provider. If the operator responds affirmatively, the particular Field Document may be accessed for entry of the comments or other information, thereby associating the information directly with the Field Document. If the operator chooses not to enter comments, the Field Document may be approved or held for later approval.</p>
  <p num="p-0174">In another aspect of the invention, a workflow history tracking software application (i.e., a tool) may be provided to document the workflow of at least one of the various embodiments of the Field Document reconciliation and approval processes. This workflow history tracking tool may be configured to create a record providing various information relating to Field Documents and a project in general. For example, the tool may record an identification of a user (for example, an gent of the operator or service provider's team), the action(s) taken by the user, and the date and time of such action(s) while also providing an indication of the Field Document, project, commercial response, work order or other information accessed and/or modified by the user. It is to be appreciated that by creating a recorded history, uncertainty facing many projects can be reduced and/or eliminated. For example, the issue of whether a Field Document was ever submitted, by whom it was authorized, and by whom payment was authorized may be quickly resolved when a workflow history tracking tool is utilized. Similarly, a workflow tracking tool may also eliminate or at least significantly reduce the incidence of time consuming searches for paper and/or computerized documents, reconciliation of such documents against other documents, and the verification of, for example, payment approvals and authorization for write-offs. In general, the workflow history tracking tool may be configured to utilize a relational database to provide the before mentioned and other features and functions.</p>
  <p num="p-0175">Workflow History Tracking Tool</p>
  <p num="p-0176">One embodiment of a process which may be utilized to provide a workflow history tracking tool is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. This embodiment is shown with respect to a Field Document approval process. It is to be appreciated, however, that other embodiments of a workflow tracking tool may be utilized for processes utilized in conjunction with the various embodiments of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0177">More specifically, for the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the workflow path status at each particular operation generally corresponds with an action taken in relation to a Field Document or other document and may correspond to the state of such a document in a system database wherein at least one version of a particular Field Document may be stored. For example, in operation <b>1602</b>, when a new Field Document is created by a service provider, the workflow path may be configured to record the action as “Field Document created” while a system database may indicate the status of Field Document as being unsubmitted.</p>
  <p num="p-0178">Further, if the Field Document is modified before submission to the system, the workflow path may be configured to identify the actions taken as “current working copy of Field Document,” while a system database might continue to indicate the Field Document as being unsubmitted, operation <b>1604</b>. When the service provider submits a Field Document for approval, the database might recognize the status of a Field Document as being “submitted” while the workflow path may indicate to the service provider that the Field Document was “submitted to the operator,” operation <b>1606</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0179">Similarly, when observed from an operator's point of view, once the Field Document is submitted to the system by the service provider, the database may be configured to identify to the operator the Field Document as being “received,” while the workflow manager may indicate that no actions were taken and that the status of the Field Document was still “Submitted to the operator,” operation <b>1608</b>. Further, when the operator reviews, modifies, or comments upon the Field Document, the workflow path may be configured to indicate that the Field Document is a “current working copy,” while the database may indicate the status of the Field Document as being “received,” operation <b>1610</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0180">As mentioned previously with reference to other process embodiments, at this point, the operator may be provided with two choices: the Field Document can either be approved or held for later approval. If the Field Document is approved by the operator, the workflow path may be configured to record this action as “approved by the operator,” while the database suitably stores the status of the Field Document as being “approved by operator,” operation <b>1612</b>. Instead, if the Field Document is held for approval by the operator, the database suitably stores the status of the Field Document as being “held for approval by the operator” while the workflow path might be configured to record the actions as “held for approval by operator,” operation <b>1614</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0181">In either event and as discussed previously, future action is generally required by the service provider. In the case of an approved Field Document, the workflow path on the service provider side may be configured to indicate the approved status of the Field Document for example by designating the Field Document's workflow as “Field Document approved by operator” and designating the status of the Field Document in the database as being “approved by operator,” while also providing the service provider access to the approved version of the Field Document in the database, operation <b>1616</b>. If the service provider optionally decides to additionally modify the approved Field Document, a working copy may be saved in the database, and the workflow path may be configured to indicate the working status of the Field Document as “current working copy of Field Document,” operation <b>1618</b>. If the service provider approves of the modifications, or if optional modifications were not made, the service provider will normally approve the Field Document, either for invoicing or resubmission to the operator, the database may be configured to store the approved Field Document as being “approved by service provider,” and the workflow path may be configured to reflect the last action as “approved by service provider,” operation <b>1624</b>. Further, if the Field Document was not modified by the service provider after approval by the operator, the Field Document may be transferred to an invoicing process. In such event, the database may be configured to record the status of the Field Document as “sent to invoicing,” while the workflow path may be configured to indicate the last action for the Field Document as being “sent to invoicing,” operation <b>1626</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0182">Referring again to operation <b>1614</b>, in the case of a Field Document being held for approval by the operator, the service provider will generally be notified of such status by an indication of “held for approval by operator” while the workflow path may indicate that the last action on the Field Document was “held for approval by operator,” operation <b>1620</b>. If the service provider makes any modifications to the held Field Document, the workflow path may be configured to indicate the last action on the Field Document as being “current working copy,” while the database might be configured to continue to represent the status of the Field Document as being “held for approval by operator,” operation <b>1622</b>. Once any modifications are made, the service provider will generally approve the Field Document, either for invoicing or resubmission to the operator. The database may be configured to store the status of the approved Field Document as being “approved by service provider,” and the workflow path may be configured to reflect the last action as being “approved by service provider,” operation <b>1624</b>. At this point, the Field Document may then proceed with operations <b>1626</b>, as discussed hereinabove. More likely, however, because the Field Document was not approved by the operator originally, the service provider may desire to resubmit the Field Document to the operator for approval, whereby the database may be configured to indicate the status of the Field Document as being “submitted,” while the workflow path may indicated the last action taken as being “submitted to operator,” operation <b>1628</b>. Once resubmitted, the workflow path cycle returns to operation <b>1608</b> on the operator side for approval of the Field Document.</p>
  <p num="p-0183">Therefore, as illustrated by the foregoing discussion and the process flow shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the workflow history tracking tool essentially provides a process for tracking actions taken with respect to a given document or item of information. The foregoing example was provided with respect to a Field Document, it is to be appreciated, however, that various embodiments of the workflow tracking tool may also be utilized to track actions taken with respect to bids, commercial responses, work orders, invoices and any other identifiable piece of information.</p>
  <p num="p-0184">User Interfaces for Providing Workflow History Tracking</p>
  <p num="p-0185">One embodiment of a user interface for providing workflow history tracking is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A-H</figref>. More specifically, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> provides one embodiment of a user interface which includes a workflow tracking template that may be utilized to provide the point of view of an operator. As shown, the workflow history may be suitably presented via a table containing various columns, such as: a column <b>1702</b> indicating a path taken by a given Field Document; a view column <b>1704</b> providing link options by which an operator may view a specific version of a Field Document; a column <b>1706</b> identifying persons who have taken some action with respect to the Field Document; a column <b>1708</b> indicating such person's titles; and a column <b>1710</b> indicating the date and time a particular action occurred. As shown, for this first template, the operator may be advised, by corresponding entries in the table, that a Field Document has been created <b>1714</b>, and that the Field Document has been submitted to the operator for review <b>1716</b>. In this instance, if the operator wishes to review and modify the Field Document, this may be accomplished by selection of either the related links in the “view” column <b>1704</b>, or by selection of the “review and process” function <b>1712</b>. However, this functionality may not always be provided, because a given “view” link may not include or may only include a link which provides only access to historical copies of the Field Document. In contrast, for this embodiment, the review and process function <b>1712</b> is generally configured to provide access to the current working version of the Field Document.</p>
  <p num="p-0186"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref> depicts the next operation in the workflow process after the operator has chosen to review the submitted Field Document. In this embodiment, the current working copy of the Field Document <b>1718</b> is listed as the next entry in the table. Generally, this version of the Field Document is only visible to the operator. The view link <b>1704</b> <i>a </i>may be configured to retrieve and present to the operator the original Field Document submitted by the service provider. Similarly, the view link <b>1704</b> <i>b </i>may be configured to retrieve and present the current working version of the Field Document. Upon selection of the review and process function <b>1712</b> the process may be configured to then access the current version of the Field Document with any changes to the submitted version <b>1716</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0187"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17C</figref> shows a next possible operation in the workflow process wherein the operator has previously chosen to hold the Field Document for approval <b>1720</b>. When the operator approves or holds a Field Document for approval, the process may be configured to remove the working copy of the Field Document <b>1718</b> (in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>), changes the approval status to held for approval <b>1720</b>, identify the name <b>1706</b> and title <b>1708</b> of the person who made the decision to hold the Field Document, and specify the date and time <b>1710</b> the decision to hold was entered or logged into a system implementing this embodiment. In this instance the review and process function <b>1712</b> (in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>) generally is not accessible by an operator because the service provider needs to take the next operation in the Field Document process. The view link <b>1704</b> <i>a </i>may be configured continue to access the original Field Document submitted by the service provider. Also, the view link <b>1704</b> <i>c </i>may be configured to access the Field Document in which the operator changes, which resulted in the held for approval by Operator workflow condition, have been recorded.</p>
  <p num="p-0188"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17D</figref> shows a possible next operation in the workflow process. Once the operator has held the Field Document for approval, the service provider may resubmit <b>1722</b> the Field Document to the operator, perhaps with modifications to enhance the likelihood of approval. In this instance, the approval and hold options available to the operator may generally be the same as those described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>. The operator may view and modify the resubmitted Field Document with the service provider's modifications, for example, by selecting the review and process function <b>1712</b>, or by selecting the view link <b>1704</b> <i>d</i>. Older versions of the Field Document may also be accessed by the selection of corresponding view links <b>1704</b> <i>a </i>and <b>1704</b> <i>c</i>, while information about previous reviewers <b>1706</b> and the dates and times <b>1710</b> of those reviews may also be provided.</p>
  <p num="p-0189"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17E</figref> shows a next possible operation in the workflow process, the operator's review of the resubmitted Field Document <b>1722</b>. Preferably, the current working copy of the Field Document <b>1724</b> will only be visible to the operator. The corresponding name <b>1706</b> and date <b>1710</b> shown are presented as of the date and time of the last revision. The view link <b>1704</b> <i>b </i>may be configured to take the operator to the original version of the Field Document submitted by the service provider. This version should be different from the second submitted Field Document <b>1722</b>, which may be accessed through a separate view link <b>1704</b> <i>d</i>. Selection of the view link <b>1704</b> <i>c </i>similarly may be configured to provide access to the held version of the Field Document returned to the service provider. View link <b>1704</b> <i>e </i>and the review and process function <b>1712</b> may each be configured to provide access to the current version of the Field Document as modified by the operator from the resubmitted Field Document <b>1722</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0190"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17F</figref> shows the next operation in the workflow process, approval of the Field Document by the operator. Once the operator approves the Field Document, the working copy entry <b>1724</b> (in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17E</figref>) may be replaced by an approved entry <b>1726</b>. The review and process function <b>1712</b> (in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17E</figref>) is not active because the next process operation should be undertaken by the service provider. The view link <b>1704</b> <i>f </i>may be configured to provide access to the latest changes to the Field Document made by the operator. The other view links <b>1704</b> generally provide access to their respective Field Document versions, as previously described hereinabove.</p>
  <p num="p-0191"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17G</figref> depicts a possible next operation in the workflow process, approval of the Field Document by the service provider. The workflow history process documents the service provider's approval and enables an operator to access an approved by service provider Field Document entry <b>1728</b> through a related view link <b>1704</b> <i>g. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0192"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17H</figref> shows another operation in a workflow history process for a particular Field Document. As shown, the template indicates, in a new entry, that the Field Document has been sent to invoicing <b>1730</b>. It should be noted, that this same workflow tracking tool may also be used to track the operations in an invoicing process while providing the same features and functions. Further, it is to be appreciated that other, less and/or additional workflow actions may also be displayed by this and/or other embodiments of a workflow tracking tool.</p>
  <p num="p-0193"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref> depicts an initial workflow history user interface/template for managing a Field Document from the point of view of the service provider. As may be provided for an operator template, the workflow history may be represented via a table containing various columns, such as: a column <b>1802</b> indicating a path taken by a given Field Document; a view column <b>1804</b> providing link options by which a service provider may view a specific version of a Field Document; a column <b>1806</b> identifying persons who have taken some action with respect to the Field Document; a column <b>1808</b> indicating such person's titles; and a column <b>1810</b> indicating the date and time a particular action occurred. As shown, for this first template, the service provider may be advised, by corresponding entries in the table, that a Field Document has been created <b>1814</b>, and that a current working copy of the Field Document <b>1816</b> is available for review. In this instance, if the service provider wishes to review and modify the Field Document, this may be accomplished by selection of either the related links in the “view” column <b>1804</b>, or by selection of the “review and process” function <b>1812</b>. However, this functionality may not always be provided, because a given row on the table may not include a “view” link or may include a link which only provides access to historical copies of the Field Document. Further, for this embodiment, the review and process function <b>1812</b> is generally configured to provide access to the current working version of the Field Document.</p>
  <p num="p-0194">If any changes are made to the Field Document after it is first created, the current working copy entry may be updated to show who made the most recent changes, by name <b>1806</b> <i>a </i>and title <b>1808</b> <i>a</i>, and when the changes were made, by date and time <b>1810</b> <i>a</i>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>. When the Field Document is submitted to the operator the working copy entry <b>1818</b> (as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>) is replaced by a submitted entry <b>1820</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref> and the associated personnel and date information is updated.</p>
  <p num="p-0195">After the Field Document is submitted, desirably no changes can be made to it. The ability to view the Field Document by selection of view link <b>1804</b> is generally provided as a read only link and the review and process function <b>1812</b> (in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>) is not active because the operator must perform the next operation in the process. Once the Field Document is approved by the operator, the workflow history may indicate such status in an entry <b>1822</b> and the service provider may be able to see who <b>1806</b> <i>l </i>approved the Field Document and when <b>1810</b> <i>l</i>. The view link <b>1804</b> <i>k </i>may be configured to access the originally prepared Field Document. Similarly, the view link <b>1804</b> <i>l </i>may be configured to enable to provide the service provider with read only access to the approved Field Document. To make changes to the Field Document or process a final approval, the service provider may select the review and process function <b>1812</b>. Further, if the service provider saves changes to the Field Document, a current working copy entry <b>1824</b> may be created in the workflow path (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18E</figref>).</p>
  <p num="p-0196">The service provider may give final approval of the Field Document or resubmit a modified Field Document to the operator. A Field Document with final service provider approval may be listed as an entry in the workflow path <b>1826</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18F</figref>. The service provider may then transfer the Field Document to an invoicing function for further processing. In this event, the workflow history tool may be configured to record the transfer of the Field Document to invoicing also as an entry <b>1828</b> in the table (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18G</figref>).</p>
  <p num="p-0197">Field Document Management Tools</p>
  <p num="p-0198">Various embodiments of the present invention may also include an offline manager that allows a user to work with a Field Document offline using, for example, an Offline Component. While in the field, a user can enter information into or make selections within the Offline Component, and once reconnected to the network, the information added or changes made to the Offline Component may be uploaded to the actual web site through a communications network.</p>
  <p num="p-0199">One embodiment of a process for assigning, managing and tracking Field Documents, both online and offline as an Offline Component, is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. As shown, this process may be suitably implemented when a user accesses a Field Document Pricing Page (operation <b>1900</b>). Once the page is accessed, the process, and/or a system implementing the process, may be configured to display the pricing page with an input alternative which enables a user to assign a Field Document either online or offline (operation <b>1902</b>). A query may be communicated to the user as to whether the user desires to select online or offline processing (operation <b>1904</b>). If the online option is selected, the process continues with querying whether a team member has been selected by the user to receive the Offline Component (operation <b>1906</b>). If a team member has been selected, a notification may be communicated to the designated team member, for example via an e-mail, that the team member is now responsible for some further action with respect to the Field Document (operation <b>1908</b>). The workflow history, if any, may then be suitably updated to indicate that the assignment (operation <b>1928</b>) has been given to a team member. Further updates the offline manager module may also be provided, as necessary, to indicate an additional activity with respect to the Field Document (operation <b>1930</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0200">If a team member is not selected, a query may be generated as to whether the user has indicated that the Field Document is to be submitted to a customer representative of the operator (operation <b>1910</b>). If so, another query may be issued as to whether the Field Document is in fact online or is offline (operation <b>1912</b>). If the Field Document is online, notification of submission of the Field Document for review and approval may be sent to the operator (operation <b>1932</b>). If the Field Document is offline, a notification may be sent to the user that a Field Document cannot be submitted to the operator while the Field Document is offline (operation <b>1934</b>). The display or other presentation medium may then be reset to the Field Document Pricing Page to allow the user to make any desired inputs (operation <b>1904</b>). If there is no user input directing submission of the Field Document to the operator, the user may be suitably informed that a team member must be selected in order to proceed with assigning a Field Document (operation <b>1914</b>). This notification may also include resetting the display to the Field Document Pricing Page in order to enable the user to make any desired inputs (operation <b>1904</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0201">Returning to the query of whether online or offline action is requested by the user (operation <b>1904</b>), in the instance where the user has indicated an offline transmittal of the Field Document, a query may be generated as to whether the user has indicated that the Field Document is to be submitted to a customer representative of the operator (operation <b>1916</b>). If this selection is affirmative, a check may be performed to determine whether the Field Document is online (operation <b>1912</b>). If the Field Document is online, notification of submission of the Field Document for review and approval may be sent to the operator (operation <b>1932</b>). If the Field Document is offline, a notification may be sent to the user that a Field Document cannot be submitted to the operator while the Field Document is offline (operation <b>1934</b>). Again, the display may then be reset to the Field Document Pricing Page in order to enable the user to make any desired inputs (operation <b>1904</b>). If there are no user inputs directing submission of the Field Document to the operator, then a notification may be sent informing the user that a team member must be selected in order to proceed with assigning a Field Document (operation <b>1914</b>). Again, the display may be reset to the display to the Field Document Pricing Page in order to enable the user to make any desired inputs (operation <b>1904</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0202">If the Field Document is not to be presently submitted to the operator, another query may be issued as to whether a team member has been selected by the user to receive the Offline Component (operation <b>1918</b>). If a team member has been selected, a query may be issued to determine whether the team member is new to the workflow process platform (operation <b>1920</b>). If so, information about team member may be obtained and the offline manager updated to include the additional information (operation <b>1922</b>). After the team member information has been updated, or if the team member is not new, an Offline Component holding the Field Document may be created and the Offline Component may be synchronized to the workflow platform (operation <b>1924</b>). The designated Offline Component may be communicated to the team member via a communications network. At this point in the process, the team member is now responsible for some further action with respect to the Field Document (operation <b>1926</b>). The process then provides for the updating of the workflow history to indicate the assignment (operation <b>1928</b>) and further updates of the offline manager module to indicate an additional activity with respect to the Field Document (operation <b>1930</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0203">On-line and Off-line Field Document Management Using Offline Components</p>
  <p num="p-0204">One embodiment of a user interface, which may be utilized in conjunction with the previously described above process is a Field Document Pricing Page and which includes the necessary functionality to enable a user to assign a Field Document online or offline, is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. As shown, generally an user can choose whether the Field Document is to be sent offline or online using radio buttons <b>2002</b> and <b>2004</b>. Further, this particular embodiment enables the user to access an existing database of customer representatives using a drop down menu <b>2006</b>. Similarly, the user may access the existing database of team members by accessing a second drop down menu <b>2008</b>. The pricing page shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> may also be equipped with button <b>2010</b> which enables the user to submit the Field Document to the selected operator and a second button <b>2012</b> which enables the user to send the Field Document to the selected team member.</p>
  <p num="p-0205">Once assigned by the offline manager, Offline Components may further be canceled before they are resynchronized with the system. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> provides one embodiment of a flow diagram depicting an exemplary process for canceling Offline Components. When a user first accesses the offline manager (operation <b>2100</b>), a user device, for example, a lap top computer or a personal data assistant, which is configured to implement the process, suitably displays a list of Offline Components previously assigned and not yet synchronized with the system (operation <b>2102</b>). A user may select to cancel a particular Offline Component (operation <b>2104</b>). In this event, the device may query as to whether the user has entered a reason for canceling the Offline Component (operation <b>2106</b>). If the user has not indicated a reason for cancellation and selects the save function (operation <b>2108</b>), the device will then notify the user that a reason for cancellation must be entered before the Offline Component will in fact be cancelled (operation <b>2112</b>). Likewise, if the user has not indicated a reason for cancellation and selects the cancel Offline Component function (operation <b>2110</b>), he device will notify the user that a reason for cancellation must be entered before the Offline Component will in fact be cancelled (operation <b>2112</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0206">The device or system implementing this process may further provide a selection of reasons for cancellation of an Offline Component. If the user did provide a reason for cancellation (in operation <b>2106</b>), the device may further inquire as to whether any of the choices for cancellation provided by the device were used (operation <b>2114</b>). If not, the user may be requested and/or required, in certain embodiments, to input a reason for cancellation in a field provided (operation <b>2116</b>). Once a reason for cancellation has been secured, the user may then select the cancel Offline Component function (operation <b>2118</b>). The device may be further configured to interject an interrogatory to confirm that the user indeed wants to cancel the Offline Component (operation <b>2120</b>). If the user confirms cancellation (operation <b>2122</b>), the device cancels the Offline Component and restores as active on the device and/or the system the Field Document version before the Offline Component was assigned (operation <b>2124</b>). It is to be appreciated that when a user device does not have access to a system, the foregoing actions may be accomplished remotely and then updates provided, as necessary to the system. Similarly, when a user device is connected via a communications network or directly to a system, the foregoing actions may be suitably accomplished on either the user device and/or the system, with the necessary data and information passing therebetween to implement the desired changes.</p>
  <p num="p-0207">Additional embodiments of an offline manager are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A-22C</figref>. More specifically, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref>, for at least one embodiment, an offline manager may be configured to provide at least one of four major functions: a listing of all Offline Components that have been checked out, a listing of who checked out a particular Offline Component along with a date and time stamp, a listing of the type of Offline Component, and the ability to cancel an Offline Component. This embodiment (and other embodiments) of the offline manage may also include links to other pages provided by the various embodiments of the present invention discussed herein and/or to other pages. For example, the embodiment may include a link <b>2202</b> to an eFT Manager, a link <b>2204</b> to the service request or work order submitted by the operator, and a link <b>2206</b> to the eFT or Response Package.</p>
  <p num="p-0208">When utilizing the offline manager feature, the current functionality of the workflow history may also be changed so that each time a new user modifies a current working copy of a Field Document, a new version of the Field Document may be created and listed in the workflow history. One embodiment of a system implementing such functionality is depicted by the user interface shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. As shown a “Previous Working copy of the eFT” <b>2302</b> may be created every time a user sends a Field Document to a different user either online or offline via an Offline Component. If an Offline Component is cancelled, such cancellation may also be shown in the workflow history. The Offline Component cancelled link <b>2304</b> may be configured to present to the user a screen display or user interface on which comments may be entered and/or presented as to why the Offline Component was cancelled. Such screen may also shows who cancelled the Offline Component and when the Offline Component was cancelled by providing a date and time stamp. If the Offline Component is offline, a View eFT link <b>2306</b> may be provided which enables the user to access generally a read only version of the Field Document before it was provided offline. This link <b>2306</b> may be further configured to present the given Field Document to the user and also to present a pop-up message stating something to the effect that “The Field Document is read only because it is currently offline.”</p>
  <p num="p-0209">Another embodiment of system and/or process for processing Field Documents which operates separately or in conformance with the other embodiments of the present invention, may include a modularization feature whereby multiple pages may be provided within a modular Field Document. It is to be appreciated that a modularization function consistent with the present invention preferably enables a service provider to select the particular pages desired, and further to modify each page, as desired. As such, generally, a single long form containing multiple parts or pages that are not used for a particular embodiment may be avoided. Further, custom fields may also be created and/or designated by the service provider to appear on each modular page as desired, for example, tracking numbers and other similar data may be included on custom forms, while not being included on other, non-custom forms. Additionally, the modularization processes of the present invention generally make it more easy to add or subtract pages to a Field Document and to create Field Documents which are tailored to individual operators, as desired by a service provider.</p>
  <p num="p-0210">In another embodiment of the present invention, which may be utilized in the oil and gas industry and/or other industries, a modularization feature may be utilized in which a user is encouraged and/or required to utilize a Job Time &amp; Activity Detail page, for example, one as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref>. The embodiment may also be configured to require a user to utilize a Field Document Pricing Page, such as one shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</figref>. Similarly, a user may be encouraged or required to utilize a Product List page, such as one shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</figref>. In other embodiments of the invention, additional optional pages may also be utilized, required, added to or subtracted from a modular Field Document as desired. Further, when utilizing these and other customization features, custom fields for the operator are generally located on the Pricing page while and custom fields for the service provider are generally located on the Job Time &amp; Activity Detail page.</p>
  <p num="p-0211">When viewing any one page of a modular Field Document, it is to be further appreciated that links to the other pages in the modular Field Document may be provided. Further, the status of each page may also be displayed next to each link. A page may also have a status associated with it, such as Final or Draft. However, generally, before a modular Field Document may be submitted to an operator, all of the pages in the Field Document should be saved and their status designated as Final. Modular Field Documents may also be configured to work with an Offline Manager in order to enable such modular Field Documents to be sent to other team members either offline or online.</p>
  <p num="p-0212">User Interface for Job Time and Activity Monitoring</p>
  <p num="p-0213">In another embodiment of the present invention, a user interface may be provided by a system via which a first user may enter and other users may verify job time and job activity details. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref>, a Job Time &amp; Activity Detail page <b>2400</b> may be provided. This page may be designated, as desired, as the main modular Field Document page. When this page (or any other page) is designated as the main modular page, whenever a user clicks on a link to a particular Field Document, the system present page <b>2400</b> to the user instead of another page, such as, the Field Document Pricing Page. As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A to 24C</figref>, the Job Time &amp; Activity page <b>2400</b> may be configured to include a header table <b>2402</b>, a work summary table <b>2404</b>, a work detail table <b>2406</b>, and an employee time table <b>2408</b>. Other fields may also be provided as specific implementations require.</p>
  <p num="p-0214">Additionally, various fields may be made available for customization on this page <b>2400</b>. For example, custom fields may be provided in the header table <b>2402</b>. Currently, six custom fields are provided and include the following: company order no. <b>2410</b>, pick up # <b>2412</b>, trip miles <b>2414</b>, work done in state of <b>2416</b>, and type of work <b>2418</b>. These and/or other custom fields may be configured to utilize text entry boxes, drop down menus, or other data entry techniques (such as voice memos).</p>
  <p num="p-0215">Similarly, customizable options may be provided for the work summary table <b>2404</b>. For example, it may be possible to rename the work summary <b>2404</b>, the 24 hour summary <b>2420</b>, and the 24 hour forecast <b>2422</b> fields, or to not include such fields at all, while including additional or other fields. The user may also be provided with the capability of hiding, minimizing, maximizing or otherwise displaying the work summary table <b>2404</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0216">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref>, activity category <b>2424</b> and trouble type <b>2426</b> drop down menus may be also be provided and customizable within the work detail table <b>2406</b>. In addition, the user may choose to display or hide the employee time table <b>2408</b>. Further, as shown on <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24C</figref>, links <b>2428</b>, <b>2430</b>, <b>2432</b>, <b>2434</b> and <b>2436</b> may be included on the Job Time &amp; Activity page <b>2400</b> as desired. The links depicted are: application home <b>2428</b>, my workflow <b>2430</b>, eFT manager <b>2432</b>, eFT workflow <b>2434</b> eFT summary <b>2436</b>, and logout <b>2438</b>. Additional links to the eFT pricing page <b>2440</b> and eFT product list <b>2442</b> are shown on <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24C</figref> along with their respective statuses (i.e. draft or final). Thus, it is to be appreciated that the job time and activity detail page may be customized as particular implementations of the present invention specify.</p>
  <p num="p-0217">User Interface for Field Document Pricing</p>
  <p num="p-0218">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</figref>, one embodiment of a Field Document Pricing Page <b>2500</b> is shown. This embodiment may be provided for an implementation of the present invention similar to that which was described in reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-C</figref>. Further, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25B and 25C</figref> provide depictions of a Field Document Pricing Page <b>2502</b> which may be utilized, for example, as part of a modular Field Document. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A and 25B</figref>, a table <b>2504</b> containing an arrive location, job start, and job completion fields, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</figref>, may be replaced or augmented, for example, with an additional pages table <b>2506</b> containing a link <b>2508</b> to a Job Time &amp; Activity page and or a second link <b>2510</b> to the a product list page.</p>
  <p num="p-0219">Various custom fields may also be made available to the operator on the Field Document Pricing Page. For example and as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B</figref>, exemplary custom fields may be located on a header table <b>2512</b>, and may be described as follows: project mgt. system number <b>2514</b>, work order number <b>2516</b>, cost center <b>2518</b>, pay key code <b>2510</b>, API number <b>2522</b> and field supervisor name <b>2524</b>. Similar to the Job Time &amp; Activity page, links to other locations may be provided including links to an application home <b>2526</b>, my workflow <b>2528</b>, eFT manager <b>2530</b>, eFT workflow <b>2532</b>, eFT summary <b>2534</b>, and logout <b>2535</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0220">Further, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25C</figref>, the bottom of the Field Document Pricing Page of the modular Field Document may also be modified to include radio buttons which enable a user to select, for example, whether to assign the modular Field Document online <b>2536</b>, or to send the Field Document offline <b>2538</b>, e.g., via an Offline Component. Additionally, the Field Document Pricing Page may include a button <b>2540</b> that enables a user to send the modular Field Document offline or online to a selected team member and a button <b>2542</b> that enables the user to submit the modular Field Document online to a customer representative of the operator.</p>
  <p num="p-0221">User Interface for Product Listing</p>
  <p num="p-0222"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A and 26B</figref> depict another embodiment of a user interface for the present invention in which a Field Document Product List page <b>2600</b> is included in a modular Field Document. As with other pages previously described hereinabove or to be described herein below, which may be included in a given modular Field Document page, a link to the Job Time &amp; Activity page <b>2602</b> and a link to the Field Document Pricing Page <b>2604</b> may be provided and/or displayed along with their respective statuses. In addition, and similar to the before mentioned Job Time &amp; Activity and the Field Document Pricing Pages, links may also be provided to the following locations: application home <b>2606</b>, my workflow <b>2608</b>, eFT manager <b>2610</b>, eFT workflow <b>2612</b>, eFT summary <b>2614</b>, and logout <b>2616</b>. The service provider name <b>2618</b> may also be displayed on the product list page <b>2600</b>. The date shown in the update field <b>2620</b> may also be the same date entered in, for example, a pricing current as field on a Field Document Pricing Page. The eFT number <b>2622</b> shown may also be provided as a system generated eFT ID. As further shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</figref>, some fields may also be pre-populated from the Field Document Pricing Page and/or other pages or information, for example, the operator name <b>2624</b>, well name <b>2626</b>, and field name <b>2628</b> may be pre-populated.</p>
  <p num="p-0223">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26B</figref>, the product list page may be configured such that the user can check radio boxes <b>2630</b> next to the items in the product list to specify what items were used on a job site. The user may also choose check a pre-populate radio button <b>2632</b> in order to have the checked items pre-populated onto the Field Document Pricing Page. It is to be appreciated that pre-populating the Field Document Pricing Page with frequently used items reduces the need to duplicate information across entries as new Field Documents are created. Further, this function enables users to only enter quantities used and other task specific information while not having to repeatedly reenter commonly utilized categories on the Field Document Pricing Page and/or other pages.</p>
  <p num="p-0224">Customization Manager</p>
  <p num="p-0225">In another embodiment of the present invention, a customization manager may be provided. The customization manager enables a user to customize various aspects of systems, user interfaces, and/or process implementing the present invention. For example, the customization manager may provide for customization of the Job Time &amp; Activity page, the price list page, and the product list page within a modular Field Document. Similarly, custom fields, which may also require custom processing, may also be provided on work orders and invoices.</p>
  <p num="p-0226">One embodiment of a process illustrating how the customization manager feature may be utilized is provided with reference to the flow charts shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A-F</figref>. Although not necessary, it may be desirable to limit access to the customization manager in order to prevent the creation of duplicate custom fields. Limiting access the customization manager may be achieved by utilizing a login routine, for example, one requiring a username and password. Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</figref>, this process begins when a user first logs into the customization manager (operation <b>2702</b>). Once logged into the customization manager, which may be suitably provided by a system or device configured commonly via software or via hardcoding to provide such features, the user may select a company type (operation <b>2704</b>) and a unit type (operation <b>2706</b>). Examples of company types are operator and service provider, and examples of unit type are SI and English. In this embodiment, the system then determines whether an operator or service provider has been selected as the company type (operation <b>2708</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0227">If the system determines that an operator has been selected (operation <b>2708</b>), the system displays the list of operating company names within a database (operation <b>2710</b>). The user may then select a company name (operation <b>2712</b>). The system then refreshes the page to display a list of pages available for customization (operation <b>2714</b>) for the particular company selected. The system may also be configured to then record the user's customizations to various fields for display (operation <b>2722</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</figref>) and record the user's selections of pages where the customized fields will be displayed. (operation <b>2724</b>). In one embodiment of the present invention, the system may provide a user with a choice of displaying customized fields on the work order page, the Field Document, and/or the invoice page. In other embodiments, other customizable pages may be provided.</p>
  <p num="p-0228">Once the user has completed any customizations to a selected page, the system determines if the user wishes to preview a particular page (operation <b>2728</b>). If so, the system displays the particular page (operation <b>2730</b>). If not, (the system determines if the user has requested to save the customizations as a draft version (operation <b>2732</b>) and, if so, the system records the date of modification and the user's name (operation <b>2734</b>). The system may then assign the customized page a status of “draft” and save the customized page in a database accessible by the system (operation <b>2736</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0229">However, if the system determines that the user did not request to save a draft version of the page (operation <b>2732</b>), the system determines if the user requested to save a final version of the page (operation <b>2738</b>). If so, the system records the date of modification and the user's name (operation <b>2740</b>), assigns the customized page a status of “final” and saves the customized page in a database accessible by the system (operation <b>2742</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0230">Referring back to operation <b>2708</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</figref>, if the system determines that an operator was not selected (i.e. a service provider was selected), the system displays the list of service provider company names obtained from a database accessible by the system (operation <b>2716</b>). Upon the user selecting a company name (operation <b>2718</b>), the system refreshes the page to display a list of pages available for customization. (operation <b>2720</b>) for the selected company. The system then displays the page chosen by the user for customization. In one embodiment of the present invention, the user may choose from among four pages for customization. The available customizable pages for a service provider may be the product/price, the Job Time &amp; Activity page, the custom invoice setup page, and a rig report. However, in other embodiments additional and/or other pages may be available for modification, as particular needs require.</p>
  <p num="p-0231">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27C</figref>, the system may display the Job Time &amp; Activity customization page if the operator so requests (operation <b>2744</b>). Upon entry by the user, the system may then record the page title (operation <b>2746</b>) and any user's selections as to whether various custom fields will be displayed (operation <b>2748</b>). More specifically, the system may be configured to record text entered in the custom field by the user, text/entries selected via a drop down menu in a custom field and/or entries otherwise provided by the user (operation <b>2750</b>). The system then determines whether the user has selected to use drop down menus in the custom fields (operation <b>2752</b>). If the system determines that the user has selected to use drop down menus (operation <b>2752</b>), a template may be provided for entering choices in the drop down menu (operation <b>2754</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0232">Next, the system records the user's choices whether to display or hide custom fields on a Field Document (operation <b>2756</b>). The system then records the time and activity and trouble type drop down menus entered by the user (operation <b>2758</b>). The user then selects whether to display the drop down menus (operation <b>2760</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0233">The system then records the employee information entered by the user (operation <b>2762</b>). The system determines whether the user desires to display the employees' social security numbers (operation <b>2764</b>). If so, the system creates a display field for the social security numbers (operation <b>2766</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0234">Next, the system records the employee job classifications entered by the user (operation <b>2768</b>). The system then proceeds with operations <b>2728</b>-<b>2742</b>, as discussed previously hereinabove.</p>
  <p num="p-0235">Referring again to operation <b>2720</b>, on <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</figref>, as mentioned above the service provider may choose between various pages to customize. When the service provider chooses to customize the product/price list screen for a service provider the process flow continues in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27D</figref> with operation <b>2770</b>. Upon entry by the user, the system will record the page title (operation <b>2772</b>). The system then creates a new category for a category array upon input by the user (operation <b>2774</b>). A category name is then stored in the array (operation <b>2776</b>) and field information for each field in a category (i.e. product code, description, unit price, units of measure, and display) is recorded in the array (operation <b>2778</b>). Essentially, the array provides descriptors of characteristics for a given good or service. Once these descriptors have been entered, the system then proceeds with operations <b>2728</b>-<b>2742</b>, as discussed previously hereinabove.</p>
  <p num="p-0236">One embodiment of a user interface by which a system or device, providing the before mentioned customization features, may be accessed and/or utilized for at least one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A to 28C</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28A</figref>, the before mentioned customization manager features may be accessed via a system providing web pages. It is to be appreciated, that such features may also be accessed in non-Web browser configured applications, such as an application providing a JavaScript or other customized applications. As shown for this particular embodiment, the customization manager enables a user to specify, for example, via a drop down menu, a unit type (e.g. SI or English) <b>2802</b>, a company name <b>2804</b>, and a company type <b>2806</b> (e.g. operator or service provider). When the user selects an operating company or service provider company from the drop down menu, a system or device implementing this embodiment of a customization manager then lists those pages, if any, which are available for customization and the status of each page. One example, of such a listing is provided in the text box <b>2808</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28B</figref>. As mentioned previously, this page may be configured to present status information for any and/or all customizable pages, if any, in a status box <b>2810</b>. For example, when the initial customization is started for a company, the status box <b>2810</b> may be instructed to display “ . . . ” indicating that no customizations have been created for the company. The status may also indicate draft, final or other conditions. Also, operators and service providers may have different pages available for customization.</p>
  <p num="p-0237">In one embodiment of the invention, the operator may create, edit and display custom fields on the Work Order page, Field Document Pricing Page, and the Invoice page. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28C</figref> depicts one embodiment of a user interface which enables a user to select various custom fields to be displayed for an operator. The screen/user interface may be pre-populated with the operator name <b>2812</b> from the operator name selected in the customization manager. The screen shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28C</figref> may also display other information such as the status of the page <b>2814</b> (i.e. final or draft), when it was last modified <b>2816</b>, and who last modified it <b>2818</b>. Customizable fields <b>2820</b> may also be listed. The user may also be provided with a selection as to whether to display a particular custom field on a work order, a Field Document, and/or an Invoice by checking the display on work order check box <b>2822</b>, the display on Field. Document check box <b>2824</b>, or the display on invoice checkbox <b>2826</b>, respectively. The user may also select whether a customizable field is to be read only, editable, or internal by clicking on the read only radio button <b>2828</b>, the editable radio button <b>2830</b>, or the internal radio button <b>2832</b>, respectively. When a field is selected to be read only, ideally both operators and service providers may view the field, but only the operators can make changes to the field. However, when a field is selected to be editable, either the service provider or the operator may be permitted to view and/or make changes to the field. Alternatively, when a field is selected to be internal, the system is configured such that only an operator may view and make changes to the field. The user may also add new custom fields by clicking on the add new custom field button <b>2834</b>. While and/or after the user has made any selections, the user may preview the custom fields on the work order page by clicking on the preview work order button <b>2836</b>. Similarly, the user may preview the custom fields on the Field Document Pricing Page by clicking on the preview eFT pricing page button <b>2838</b>. Similarly, the user may save the page as a draft by clicking the save draft button <b>2840</b>, or the page may be saved as a final version by clicking the save final button <b>2842</b>. Further, whenever the page is saved as a draft or a final version, the Last Modified Date field <b>2816</b> and the Last Modified By field <b>2818</b> may be automatically updated.</p>
  <p num="p-0238">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29A</figref>, as previously stated, when the user selects a service provider company from the drop down menu, the user interface/screen will refresh and list all the pages available for customization along with their respective statuses. For example, for the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29A</figref>, the screens available for customization by the service provider include a price/product list setup page <b>2902</b>, a time/activity page setup <b>2904</b>, an invoice setup <b>2906</b>, and a rig report setup <b>2908</b>. The status <b>2910</b> of each page may also be displayed.</p>
  <p num="p-0239">If the user selects to customize the time/activity page setup, an user interface/screen similar to those depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29B-29E</figref> may be displayed. The user interface/screen display may be pre-populated with the service provider name <b>2912</b> (as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29B</figref>). The service provider name and other information may be pre-populated from earlier entries/information provided to and/or obtained by the customization manager. The screen shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29B</figref> may also display other information such as the status of the page <b>2914</b>, when the page was last modified <b>2916</b>, and who last modified the page <b>2918</b>. The page name field <b>2920</b> preferably, by default, displays job time &amp; activity detail, but may be changed by the user or may default to other information as desired for specific embodiments of the present invention. Further, the page name field <b>2920</b> generally will contain the name of the link listed on the Field Document Pricing Page and eFT Product List pages. It is to be appreciated that these pages may be provided within a modular Field Document or otherwise. Because the custom fields on the Job Time &amp; Activity page generally pertain to service providers, the system may be configured so that operators may view the pages, but may not edit the pages. Additionally, in other embodiments, the service provider may also have other internally customized fields which an operator may not be able to view and/or edit.</p>
  <p num="p-0240">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29B and 29C</figref>, various custom fields <b>2922</b> may be identified and listed, for example, on the left hand side of the user interface/screen. In the embodiments shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29B and 29C</figref>, the service provider is allowed a maximum of six custom fields. However, in other embodiments, more or less fields may be customizable. The service provider may suitably select whether the custom field will be text boxes or drop down menus, for example, by selecting yes or no radio buttons, check boxes <b>2924</b> (as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29B</figref>) or drop down menu options <b>2926</b> (as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29C</figref>). In one embodiment, if the user selects to use a drop down menu, a maximum of twenty-five choices may be listed in the drop down menu. Similarly, the order of the custom fields may be altered by changing the rank order of each field (as identified by the numbers <b>2928</b> in the drop down menus on the left hand side of the screen). It is to be appreciated that other well known methods and techniques for ordering fields on a page may also be utilized. Additionally, text entry fields <b>2922</b> may also be provided in which a user may manually input or obtain from another listing a description for each custom field. As is provided for above with respect to the other options shown on <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29C</figref>, the text entry fields may be pre-populated, populated via drop down menus, populated by manual text entry or otherwise populated, as necessary.</p>
  <p num="p-0241">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29D</figref>, the system may be configured to enable an user to also edit a work summary table <b>2930</b>. For example, in this embodiment, the name of the work summary table may be changed, and the names of the row headers within the table may also be changed. The default name of the work summary table may be Work Summary, and the default row header names may be Work Summary <b>2932</b>, 24 Hour Summary <b>2934</b>, and 24 Hour Forecast <b>2936</b>. Other header and/or row names may also be utilized as desired. The system may also be configured to enable the user to choose whether to display the work summary table on a Field Document. This choice may be made, for example, by selecting “yes” or “no” from a drop down menu <b>2938</b>. The fields may be displayed if the service provider wants to allow the operator to run a rig report.</p>
  <p num="p-0242">The system may also enable the user to define Time &amp; Activity details. More specifically, a plurality of categories <b>2940</b> may be provided. In the present embodiment a maximum of 25 categories are permitted. Further, The system may allow the user to enter names in the text fields of the various Time &amp; Activity categories. Further, the user may be provided the option of designating particular categories to display in the Time &amp; Activity drop down menu, by suitably providing check boxes <b>2942</b>, radio buttons, drop down menus or the like.</p>
  <p num="p-0243">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29E</figref>, this embodiment of a system and user interface associated therewith may also enable a user may to enter employee information, for example, in an Employee Information table <b>2946</b>. For example, the user may be able to enter an employee's name <b>2948</b> and/or social security number <b>2950</b> in the appropriate fields. Further, inputted employee information may be recorded in a database accessible by the system once the user “clicks” on a Save and Add Employee button <b>2952</b> or otherwise designates that an entry is to be saved.</p>
  <p num="p-0244">In a similar manner, the user may define various job classifications by entering a particular job classification in the Job Classification field <b>2954</b>. The system embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29E</figref> may be configured to record the entered job classification when the user clicks on the Save and Add a Job Classification button <b>2956</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29E</figref>, the user may be provided some choices relating to where employee social security numbers are displayed and who may view them. For example, the system enables a user to designate whether a social security number should be displayed on a Field Document by providing the “Do not display Social Security Numbers on EFT radio button <b>2958</b>. However, the system also enables the user to choose to have social security numbers displayed on Field Documents, but on a restricted access basis, for example, so that only a service provider may view a social security number, by providing a “Display Social Security Numbers with name on eFT—Service Provider View Only” radio button <b>2960</b>. The system may also be configured to enable a user to choose to have employee social security numbers displayed on Field Documents for both the operator and service provider views by providing the “Display Social Security Numbers with name on eFT—Operator and Service Provider Views” radio button <b>2962</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0245">Further, the system enables a user to preview entries by providing a preview button <b>2964</b>. When this button <b>2964</b> is selected or “clicked,” the system displays a preview of the Job Time &amp; Activity Detail page. The system also enables a user to choose whether to save the page as a draft version or a final version by providing the Save Draft <b>2966</b> or Save Final buttons <b>2968</b>. The system may also be configured to record the user's work and update the status of the page to draft or final when the save draft button <b>2966</b> or the save final button <b>2968</b> is selected.</p>
  <p num="p-0246">As previously stated, an embodiment of the present invention may also enable a user to customize the Price/Product List page for a service provider. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29A</figref>, when a user clicks on the Price/Product List Setup link <b>2902</b> to access the customization screen, a page similar to that depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29F-29H</figref> may be displayed.</p>
  <p num="p-0247">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29F</figref>, the user interface/screen may be pre-populated with the service provider name <b>2912</b> from the service provider name selected in the customization manager.</p>
  <p num="p-0248">Further, the screens shown in FIGS. <b>29</b>F,<b>29</b>G and/or <b>29</b>H may also display other information such as the status of the page <b>2914</b> (i.e. final or draft), when it was last modified <b>2916</b>, and who last modified it <b>2918</b>. Further, the system/user interface may provide a page name field <b>2920</b> in which the name of the link listed on the Field Document Pricing Page and/or the Product List pages may be presented. Because the custom fields on the Price/Product List page pertain mainly to service providers, the system may be configured so that operators may be able to view these pages, but may not edit them. In another embodiment, the service provider may also be presented or have access to internal customized fields that an operator may not be able to view and/or edit.</p>
  <p num="p-0249">The customization manager also enables a user to specify a category and enter various items within a particular category. For example, the system/user interface allows a user to specify a category name in the Category Name field <b>2970</b>. In one embodiment, the category name may be limited to twenty-five characters. Also, the system allows an user to specify or provide data for each item in the fields below the Category Name <b>2970</b>. One such field, is the Item # field <b>2972</b>, which is commonly referred to as the product code. In certain embodiments, the Item # field <b>2972</b> may be limited to fifteen characters and may be a required field. Further, the system may be configured so that duplicate item numbers may not be entered, and to notify the user when a page is saved and duplicate numbers have been entered.</p>
  <p num="p-0250">The system also allows a user to enter a description of an item in a Description field <b>2974</b>. The Description field <b>2974</b> may be limited to fifty characters, and may be a required field for this and/or other embodiments. Similarly, the system allows a user to enter a unit of measure in the Unit Price <b>2976</b> and the Units of Measure field <b>2978</b>, for example, using a drop down menu. The Units of Measure field <b>2978</b> may be a required field, and the choices in the drop down menu may be the same as those provided in a given Field Document, if so desired. Examples of choices that may appear in the Units of Measure drop down menu include the following: BBL, BBLS, CUFT, DAY, EACH, GAL/SACKS, GALLONS, HOUR, JOB, LB, MILES, MONTH, SACKS, FT, and GAL.</p>
  <p num="p-0251">The system/user interface may also be configured so that a user may choose a category from the drop down menu to insert into the WELLOGIX Category field <b>2980</b>. The WELLOGIX Category field <b>2980</b> may be a required field, and the choices in the drop down menu may be the same as those provided on a given Field Document. Examples of choices that may appear in the WELLOGIX Category drop down menu include the following: Delivery Charges, Setup Charges, Service Charges, Product Charges, Equipment Charges, Third Party Charges, and Taxes and Fees. The system desirably also allows the user to choose whether to display an item on the Product List page of a modular Field Document by providing a display check box <b>2982</b> which corresponds to a given item. Likewise, if the display radio button <b>2982</b> is not checked, the item, preferably, will not be displayed.</p>
  <p num="p-0252">The system/user interface also provides the option of having entries recorded by the customization manager by providing a Save and Add Another Item button <b>2984</b>. When this button is selected, the customization manager desirably records the entries for the particular item and displays a new row of blank entry fields in which a next item, if any, may be entered by the user. Once the user has completed entry of all items pertaining to a particular category, the system enables the user to create a new category by providing an Add A New Category button <b>2986</b>. When this button <b>2986</b> is selected or “clicked” the system records the user's entries in the previous category and displays blank entry fields for the new category to be entered. Further, once the user has completed any desired entries, the system enables to the user to preview the work/entries to date by providing a preview button <b>2964</b>. When this button <b>2964</b> is selected, the system then displays a preview of the Price/Product List page. The user may also choose to save the page as a draft version or a final version by clicking on the Save Draft <b>2966</b> or Save Final buttons <b>2968</b> provided by the system on the user interface. The system will then record the user's work and update the status of the page to draft or final.</p>
  <p num="p-0253">Versioning with the Customization Manager</p>
  <p num="p-0254">Embodiments of the customization manager conforming to the present invention may also include a versioning feature. Versioning allows the user to change the operator and service provider custom fields and maintains a history of previously used custom fields. In one embodiment of the present invention, three types of customization manager versions may be provided: a working copy version, a current active version, and a previously created version. A version number may be assigned to each group of documents managed by the customization manager. The version numbers may start, for example, with the number one (1) for the oldest version and increment by one for each subsequently created version. Other numbering schemes may also be utilized. For example, a group of documents managed in the customization manager for use between a particular service provider and operator may have a working copy version number three, a current active version number two, and previously created version number one.</p>
  <p num="p-0255">In one embodiment of the present invention, service providers may be provided access to four types of documents (time and activity, price/product list, invoice, and rig report). Each of these types of documents may be assigned unique version numbers. For example, the pages for service provider “A” and operator “B” within the customization manager with a version number six (6) may have the following version numbers:</p>
  <p num="p-0256">Customization Manger—SP-A &amp; O-B Version 6</p>
  <p num="p-0257"> <tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"> <table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" class="description-table"> <tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"> <colspec colname="offset" colwidth="35pt" align="left"> </colspec> <colspec colname="1" colwidth="126pt" align="left"> </colspec> <colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="left"> </colspec> <thead> <tr class="description-tr"> <td class="description-td"> </td> <td namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1" class="description-td" colspan="3"> </td> </tr> </thead> <tbody valign="top"> <tr class="description-tr"> <td class="description-td"> </td> <td class="description-td">Time and Activity Version</td> <td class="description-td">3</td> </tr> <tr class="description-tr"> <td class="description-td"> </td> <td class="description-td">Price and Product Version</td> <td class="description-td">2</td> </tr> <tr class="description-tr"> <td class="description-td"> </td> <td class="description-td">Rig Report Version</td> <td class="description-td">2</td> </tr> <tr class="description-tr"> <td class="description-td"> </td> <td class="description-td">Invoice Version</td> <td class="description-td">3</td> </tr> <tr class="description-tr"> <td class="description-td"> </td> <td namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1" class="description-td" colspan="3"> </td> </tr> </tbody> </tgroup> </table> </tables> <br>
Similarly, each custom page within the customization manager for operators (work order, Field Document and invoice) may have a unique version number. If changes are made to at least one page, the page may be assigned a new version number by a customization manager. Similarly, the particular document group may also be assigned version numbers. For example, if a service provider changes at least one of the four pages in a document, and the changes are saved with a new version number, the customization manager may be configured to also assign a new version number to the entire document. For instance, if the time and activity page from the previous example is saved with a new version number 4, the customization manager may be configured to assign a new version number 7 to the document group, as follows:

  <p num="p-0260">The process describing how one embodiment of the versioning feature may be provided is further described herein with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30A and 30B</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30A</figref>, when a user accesses or “enters” an embodiment of a customization manger (operation <b>3002</b>), a system providing a versioning feature may be configured to display a present working copy of a given document with a version number (operation <b>3004</b>). The system may also be configured to issue a query as to whether a request has been made by the user to display a current active version (operation <b>3006</b>). If such a request has been made (either contemporaneously or prior) to display the current active version, the system retrieves and displays the current active version (operation <b>3008</b>). At this point, the user may then decide to close the current active version (operation <b>3010</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0261">If the system determines that no request has been made to display the current active version (operation <b>3006</b>), the system then determines whether a request has been made to display a previous version (operation <b>3012</b>). If a request has been made to display a previous version, the system retrieves and displays the previous version (operation <b>3014</b>). Again, the user may then decide to close the previous version (operation <b>3010</b>). If the system determines that no request has been made to display a previous version (operation <b>3012</b>), the system then determines whether a request has been made to edit the working copy (operation <b>3016</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0262">If a request has been made to edit the working copy (operation <b>3016</b>), the system then displays the selected Field Document page to be edited along with the version number of the page (operation <b>3018</b>). As the user edits the page, the system may be configured to automatically, periodically or upon user request store the user edits made to the desired custom fields within the page (operation <b>3020</b>). The user may also choose to save the page as final (operation <b>3022</b>), choose not to keep the changes made to the page (operation <b>3024</b>), or save the page as a draft (operation <b>3026</b>). If the user saves the page as a draft (operation <b>3026</b>), the system closes the page and again determines whether a request has been made to display a current active version (operation <b>3006</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0263">If the user chooses to save the page as final (operation <b>3022</b>), the system automatically updates the version number of the page (operation <b>3028</b>). Alternatively, if the user chooses not to keep the changes made to the page (operation <b>3024</b>), the system retains the previous version number of the page (operation <b>3030</b>). The user may then choose to make the working copy into the current version. At this point, the system then determines whether a request has been made to lock and change the working copy into the current version (operation <b>3032</b>). If no such request has been made, the system closes the page and again determines whether a request has been made to display a current active version (operation <b>3006</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0264">If the system determines that a request has been made to lock and change the working copy into the current version (operation <b>3032</b>), the system determines whether all pages have been saved as final (operation <b>3034</b>). If all pages have not been saved as final, the system informs the user that all pages must be saved as final before the working copy can be converted into the current active version (operation <b>3036</b>). However, if all pages have been saved as final, the system queries the user to confirm or cancel the user's instruction to convert the working copy into the current active version (operation <b>3038</b>). The system then determines whether the user has confirmed or cancelled his decision (operation <b>3040</b>). If the decision was cancelled, the system does not update the working copy in the current active version (operation <b>3040</b>). In contrast, if the decision was confirmed, the system converts the working copy into the current active version (operation <b>3044</b>) and retires and saves the prior active version (operation <b>3046</b>). The user may then choose to exit or remain in the customization manager. If the system determines that a request has been made to exit the customization manager (operation <b>3050</b>), the system exits the user (operation <b>3052</b>) from the customization manager. If the system determines that a request has not been made to exit the system (operation <b>3050</b>), the system again attempts to display present working copy along with version number (operation <b>3004</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0265">One embodiment of a user interface/screen prints which facilitates the above described versioning processes for a customization manager is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31A and 31B</figref>. As shown, these user interfaces/screen prints illustrate how various attributes of a user interface may relate to at least one embodiment of the previously described versioning process. Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</figref>, as with the previously described customization manager, upon entry into the customization manager and after the user has selected a company type (i.e. operator or service provider), a unit type <b>3104</b>, and a company name <b>3106</b>, the screen may be refreshed to display links to the various pages <b>3108</b> available for customization. However, when utilizing the versioning feature, a system implementing this feature may also include a version number to a working copy. Further, the system may be configured to o display by default a present working copy of a version upon entry into the customization manager. If no working copy exists, the current active version may be displayed along with its version number. Whatever page is displayed, the system may be configured to display the version number of the current active version <b>3110</b> on the screen. The system may also inform the user which page is currently being displayed <b>3112</b>. For example, the screen depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</figref> shows that the current active version is “2,” and the current view is of “Version 3—Working Copy.” The user may also be provided with the option of selecting a different page to display, for example, by selecting one from the drop down menu <b>3114</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0266">As with the previously described customization manager, the system may be configured so that the user interface enables the user to select which available page to customize by clicking on its respective link <b>3108</b>. After clicking on the link, the system preferably displays the selected page. Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31B</figref>, a price/product list page <b>3116</b> is displayed. The various attributes displayed on the page are not different from the previously described customization manager price/product list page with the exception that the version number <b>3118</b> of the page is displayed. Therefore, it is to be appreciated that any of the previously hereinabove described user interfaces/screen displays, web pages, documents or other information may be suitably identified by versioning.</p>
