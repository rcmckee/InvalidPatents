The draft sill has front and rear stops defining a draft gear pocket. The draft gear assembly has a yoke, a coupler follower, a rear follower, a front resilient member and a back resilient member. The yoke has top and bottom stops. The coupler follower is biased against the yoke top and bottom stops. The draft gear assembly also includes a center rod that extends through the yoke, through the back resilient member and through the rear follower. Prior to installation on a railcar, there is a shortening member on the center rod. The length of the assembly between the shortening member and the front of the coupler follower is slightly less than the longitudinal length of the draft gear pocket. After installation, the rear follower is positioned against rear stops of the draft sill. After installation, the yoke, coupler and coupler follower each have a neutral position and a full buff position. The yoke and coupler also have a full draft position. The draft stroke of the coupler and yoke is 1¼ inches forward. The buff stroke of the coupler and coupler follower is at least 4¼ inches rearward, while the buff stroke of the yoke is 3 inches rearward. The center rod is free from compression throughout buff movement and free from tension throughout draft movement of the coupler and yoke.</div>

The draft sills are commonly cast or fabricated sills that are mounted at the ends of the center sills of the railcar. The draft sills have a pair of front stops and a pair of rear stops, with a draft gear pocket between the stops. The draft gear assembly is received in the draft gear pocket.</p>
    <p>Each draft gear assembly is connected to one coupler, and couplers of adjacent rail cars are connected to form the train. The train may be hundreds of cars long and drawn by one or more locomotives. Typically, there is a limited amount of slack or free movement allowed between the cars; generally there is about two (2) inches of slack. This slack permits the rail cars limited movement toward and away from each other in response to train action and yard impact events.</p>
    <p>Train action events include, for example: locomotive start up and acceleration; dynamic braking; differences in braking forces of adjacent cars; and gravity-induced movement of the cars as the train moves onto and away from inclines. Yard impact events include “humping” of the individual cars to build the train in the yard; in humping, a car is pushed over a hump in the track in the yard, released and allowed to roll down the incline of the hump toward an awaiting car; during humping, the released cars can reach speeds of 4-10 mph and can severely impact the coupler of the awaiting car.</p>
    <p>Train action events and yard impact events both subject the couplers of the cars to buff impacts, and train action events also subject the couplers of the cars to draft impacts. These impacts are transmitted from the couplers to the draft gear assemblies to the rail car body. That is, as the couplers are pulled or pushed, the movement is translated to the freight car body through the draft gear assemblies. Typical draft gear assemblies include a yoke element that is connected to the coupler through a pin or key, a coupler follower and a draft gear, as well as other elements. Generally, the coupler follower is positioned against or closely spaced from the butt end of the coupler in the draft gear pocket, within the yoke. The draft gear is positioned between the coupler follower and the rear stops of the draft sill; other elements, such as a wedge, may be interposed between the draft gear and the coupler follower.</p>
    <p>In buff events, the butt end of the coupler moves inward against the coupler follower toward the rear stops of the draft sill. As the coupler and coupler follower are moved rearward, the shock of the movement is transferred to the draft gear. The draft gear typically absorbs and dissipates some of the energy from this shock through friction.</p>
    <p>In draft events, slack is taken up between adjacent cars beginning at one end of the train and ending at the other end of the train. As a result of the slack being progressively taken up, the speed differences between the railcars increases as the slack at each coupler pair is taken up, with a resultant increase in buff and draft impacts on the couplers. For instance, during locomotive acceleration of a 50 car train from rest there is a total of 100 inches of slack between the 50 pairs of couplers in the train. This slack is taken up progressively, coupler pair by coupler pair. When the 2 inch slack in the coupler pair joining the last car to the train is taken up the next to the last car may be moving at a speed of 4 miles per hour. The slack in the last coupler pair is taken up very rapidly and the last two cars are subjected to a very large impact capable of injuring the lading or the car.</p>
    <p>Various types of draft gear assemblies have been proposed and used. Some draft gear assemblies employ mechanical springs and steel friction members held in a steel housing that is received in a yoke. Other draft gear assemblies employ elastomer springs. However, those employing a steel housing add to the weight of the railcar. Those employing elastomer springs may be difficult to install and remove from standard draft sills.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention addresses the problems incident to train action and yard impact events. The present invention addresses these problems in a manner that is useful in applications such as tank cars, grain cars and coal cars, where the lading need not be protected from damage but where it is desirable to protect the railcar from damage due to train action and yard impact events. The present invention may be used in other applications as well.</p>
    <p>In one aspect, the present invention provides a draft gear assembly for use with railcars having coupler members. The draft gear assembly has front and back ends and comprises a yoke, a coupler follower, at least one front resilient member, and at least one back resilient member. The yoke has a back wall, a top wall extending from the back wall toward the front end of the draft gear assembly, and a bottom wall extending from the back wall toward the front end of the draft gear assembly. The coupler follower is positioned between the back wall of the yoke and the front end of the draft gear assembly. The front resilient member is positioned between the coupler follower and the back wall of the yoke. The back resilient member is positioned between the yoke back wall and the back end of the draft gear assembly. The front and back resilient members are compressible. The rear follower is positioned rearward of the back resilient member. The coupler follower has a buff stroke of 4¼ inches but does not move in draft. The yoke has a draft stroke of 1¼ inches.</p>
    <p>In another aspect, the present invention provides a draft gear assembly for use with a railcar having a coupler member and a draft sill with front and rear stops defining a draft gear pocket to receive at least part of the draft gear assembly. The draft gear pocket has a length between the front stops and rear stops. The draft gear assembly has front and back ends and comprises a yoke having a back wall, a top wall extending from the back wall toward the front end of the draft gear assembly, and a bottom wall extending from the back wall toward the front end of the draft gear assembly. The draft gear assembly also has a coupler follower positioned between the back wall of the yoke and the front end of the draft gear assembly. The coupler follower has a forward facing stop surface. The draft gear assembly has at least one front resilient member positioned between the coupler follower and the back wall of the yoke and at least one back resilient member positioned between the yoke back wall and the back end of the draft gear assembly. There is a rear follower positioned rearward of the back resilient member. The rear follower has a rearward facing stop surface. A center rod extends through the rear follower, through the back resilient member and through the back wall of the yoke. Prior to installation on the railcar the yoke, coupler follower, front resilient member, back resilient member, rear follower and center rod comprise an assembly. This assembly further includes a shortening member on the center rod at the rear follower. The length of the assembly between the stop surface of the coupler follower and the stop surface of the rear follower is less than the length of the draft gear pocket. After installation on the railcar, the coupler follower is positioned against the front stops and the rear follower is positioned against the rear stops. After installation on the railcar the yoke has a neutral position, a full draft position forward of the neutral position, and a full buff position rearward of the neutral position. The center rod is free from tension when the coupler member is in the full draft position, is free from tension and compression when the coupler member is in the neutral position, and is free from compression when the coupler member is in the full buff position.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading> <p>Three embodiments of railroad freight car draft gear assemblies are illustrated in the accompanying figures, and two of those embodiments are illustrated in FIGS. 1-4 and <b>11</b>-<b>14</b> as installed within a railroad freight car draft sill, with couplers attached to the draft gear assembly.</p>
    <p>The three illustrated embodiments show that the draft gear assembly of the present invention may be used with standard E-couplers and rotary dump couplers, as well as with couplers having E coupler heads and F shanks, for example. It should be understood that the principles of the present invention are also expected to be applicable to any other type of coupler system in present use or that may come into use in the future.</p>
    <p>In the following description, like reference numbers have been used for like parts. In some cases, reference numbers are followed by the letter “F”, “E” or “R”. The letter “F” is used in combination with a reference number if the part or portion of the part is specific to the embodiment used with a standard F-shank coupler. The letter “E” is used in combination with a reference number if the part or portion of the part is specific to the embodiment used with a standard E-coupler. The letter “R” is used if the part is specific to the embodiment used with a standard rotary dump coupler.</p>
    <p>Throughout this description, references are made to inboard, forward or front positions or directions, and to outboard, rear, back or rearward positions or directions. The terms outboard, forward and front should be understood to refer to the longitudinally outboard position or direction shown at <b>2</b> in FIGS. 1-4 and <b>11</b>-<b>14</b>, toward the outside of the draft sill. The terms inboard, rear, back and rearward should be understood to refer to the longitudinally inboard position or direction, toward the center of the freight railcar, shown at <b>4</b> in FIGS. 1-4 and <b>11</b>-<b>14</b>.</p>
    <p>All of the embodiments of the draft gear assembly <b>10</b>F, <b>10</b>E, <b>10</b>R of the present invention may be used in combination with standard couplers and draft sills to define coupler or draft systems. In all cases, the draft sill <b>12</b> may be cast or fabricated, and may have standard features. No modifications of the draft sill are necessary for use with the draft gear assemblies of the present invention.</p>
    <p>The draft sill <b>12</b> may have a pair of laterally spaced front stops <b>14</b> and a pair of laterally spaced rear stops <b>16</b> connected to spaced side walls <b>15</b>. The front and rear stops <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are also longitudinally spaced apart. As shown in FIGS. 3 and 14, the illustrated draft sill also has a top wall <b>17</b>, although the present invention may be used with draft sills lacking such a top wall. The front and rear stops <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> define a draft gear pocket <b>18</b> between them. These draft sill features are illustrated in FIGS. 1-4 and <b>11</b>-<b>14</b>. The draft sills may have other standard features and may be made of standard materials in standard ways. The illustrated draft gear assemblies may be used with standard cast or fabricated draft sills.</p>
    <p>The draft gear pocket <b>18</b> is of the standard AAR size: the longitudinal distance between the inboard faces of the front stops <b>14</b> to the outboard faces of the rear stops <b>16</b> is 24⅝ inches, shown at d<b>1</b> in FIGS. 1 and 13. All of the illustrated embodiments of the draft gear assembly <b>10</b>F, <b>10</b>E, <b>10</b>R of the present invention may be retrofitted into existing standard draft sills with standard-sized draft gear pockets <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p>When installed, the front end <b>11</b> of each draft gear assembly <b>10</b>F, <b>10</b>E, <b>10</b>R extends past the front stops <b>14</b> of the draft sill toward the longitudinal outboard end <b>20</b> of the draft sill and the back end <b>13</b> of the draft gear assembly is at the back stops <b>16</b> of the draft sill. Each draft gear assembly is connected to a standard coupler that extends in an outboard direction past the front end <b>21</b> (that is, the striker) of the draft sill. In FIGS. 1-4, the F-shank coupler (with an E coupler head in the illustrated embodiment) is shown at <b>22</b>F. In FIGS. 11-14, the E coupler is shown at <b>22</b>E. The rotary dump coupler is not illustrated. The draft gear assemblies <b>10</b>F, <b>10</b>E, <b>10</b>R may each be used with a standard coupler having standard features and made of standard materials in standard ways. The standard couplers all have coupler horns shown at <b>23</b> in FIGS. 1-4 and <b>11</b>-<b>14</b>.</p>
    <p>Each of the illustrated draft gear assemblies <b>10</b>F, <b>10</b>E, and <b>10</b>R include a yoke <b>24</b>E, <b>24</b>F, <b>24</b>R, a coupler follower <b>26</b>F, <b>26</b>E, <b>26</b>R, at least one front resilient member <b>28</b>, at least one back resilient member <b>30</b>, and a rear follower <b>32</b>. Each draft gear assembly also includes a center rod <b>34</b> and a shortening member <b>36</b>. Although the illustrated yokes and coupler followers differ for each of the illustrated types of couplers, the front resilient members <b>28</b>, back resilient members <b>30</b>, rear followers <b>32</b>, center rods <b>34</b> and shortening members <b>36</b> are the same in each of the illustrated embodiments.</p>
    <p>As can be seen in FIGS. 1-4 and <b>11</b>-<b>14</b>, the draft systems of the present invention lack any draft gear housing between the resilient members <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> and the walls <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> of the draft sill <b>12</b>. Therefore, the weight of the draft system should be reduced as compared to typical all steel draft gear systems.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIGS. 7, <b>17</b> and <b>21</b>, each yoke <b>24</b>F, <b>24</b>E, <b>24</b>R has a top wall <b>40</b>, an integral bottom wall <b>42</b> and an integral back wall <b>44</b>. The top wall <b>40</b> and bottom wall <b>42</b> are connected at the back end by the back wall <b>44</b>. The top wall <b>40</b> and bottom wall <b>42</b> extend generally horizontally toward the front end <b>11</b> of the draft gear assembly. The back wall <b>44</b> extends generally vertically from the top wall <b>40</b> to the bottom wall <b>42</b>. Each yoke <b>24</b>F, <b>24</b>E, <b>24</b>R also has front members <b>46</b> that extend generally vertically between the top wall <b>40</b> and bottom wall <b>42</b>.</p>
    <p>In the illustrated embodiment, the top wall <b>40</b> of each yoke also has a pair of laterally aligned top stops <b>45</b> extending downward. The top stops <b>45</b> are positioned longitudinally between the back wall <b>44</b> and the front end of the yoke. The bottom wall <b>42</b> of each yoke of the illustrated embodiment also has a pair of laterally aligned bottom stops <b>47</b> extending upward. The bottom stops <b>47</b> are positioned longitudinally between the back wall <b>44</b> and the front end of the yoke. The stops <b>45</b>, <b>47</b> are aligned to provide co-planar inboard-facing stop surfaces, the plane of the stop surfaces being vertical and extending laterally through the yoke. As shown in FIGS. 15-17, the stops <b>45</b>, <b>47</b> may comprise the vertical surfaces of the connecting elements <b>46</b>.</p>
    <p>The entire yoke <b>24</b> may comprise a steel casting, or it may be fabricated from separate steel components. The top and bottom walls <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> are integral with the back wall <b>44</b> as well as with the connecting elements <b>46</b> and top and bottom stops <b>45</b>, <b>47</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 7, in the yoke <b>24</b>F of the first illustrated embodiment, the top wall <b>40</b> and bottom wall <b>42</b> have a pair of vertically-aligned forward holes <b>48</b> and a pair of vertically-aligned rearward holes <b>50</b>. As shown in FIG. 3, when assembled with the coupler <b>22</b>F, the coupler pin <b>52</b> extends through the vertically aligned forward holes <b>48</b> in the yoke and a vertically aligned hole in the coupler shank <b>54</b>. As can also be seen in FIG. 3, the vertically aligned forward holes <b>48</b> of the yoke and the corresponding hole in the coupler shank have longitudinal dimensions greater than the diameter of the coupler pin <b>52</b>. Thus, when the draft system is at the full buff position as in FIG. 2, there is substantially no contact between the coupler pin <b>52</b> and the portions of the top and bottom walls of the yoke at the inboard and outboard ends of the holes <b>48</b>; in addition, there is substantially no contact between the coupler shank <b>54</b> and the coupler pin <b>52</b> so the coupler pin is not under stress. Similarly, when the draft system is in the neutral position shown in FIGS. 3-4, there is substantially no stress on the coupler pin <b>52</b>. However, as described in more detail below, in the full draft position, the coupler pin <b>52</b> does contact the top and bottom walls <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> of the yoke <b>24</b>F to pull the yoke <b>24</b>F with the coupler <b>22</b>F. The coupler <b>22</b>F and its shank may have standard features known in the art.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 7, the rearward vertically aligned holes <b>50</b> of the yoke <b>24</b>F of the F-shank draft gear assembly <b>10</b>F are surrounded by a depression in the top and bottom walls <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> of the yoke <b>24</b>F. The purpose of these rearward vertically aligned holes <b>50</b> and the surrounding depression is to reduce the weight of the yoke. The yoke can be made without these holes <b>50</b> and depressions.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 17, the yoke <b>24</b>E of the E-shank draft gear assembly <b>10</b>E includes features to allow the assembly to be used with an E coupler. The yoke <b>24</b>E has a pair of spaced, forward-extending side walls <b>56</b>. These side walls <b>56</b> have horizontally aligned key slots <b>58</b>. As shown in FIGS. 11-13, these key slots <b>58</b> receive the coupler key <b>59</b> that also extends through a slot in the E coupler shank <b>60</b>. The longitudinal dimensions of the slots <b>58</b> in the yoke side walls and the slot in the coupler shank <b>60</b> are great enough so that the key <b>59</b> does not contact the yoke walls <b>56</b> at the longitudinal inboard and outboard limits of the key slots <b>58</b> when the coupler assembly is in the full buff position and neutral position to prevent the key from undergoing any substantial stress during buff impacts. When the coupler assembly is in the full draft position shown in FIG. 11, the coupler <b>22</b>E pulls the yoke <b>24</b>E in the longitudinally outboard direction through the key <b>59</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 21, the rotary shank yoke <b>24</b>R may have a pair of vertically aligned holes <b>62</b> in the top wall <b>40</b> and bottom wall <b>42</b> of the yoke near the back wall <b>44</b>. The interior of the yoke at the outboard end may have standard features for receiving and retaining the butt end of the rotary dump coupler shank. The rotary dump coupler is not shown in the accompanying drawings, but may be a commercially available rotary coupler. The function of the holes <b>62</b> is to reduce the weight of the yoke <b>24</b>R. The yoke <b>24</b>R can be made without these holes <b>62</b>.</p>
    <p>The back wall <b>44</b> of each yoke <b>24</b>F, <b>24</b>E, <b>24</b>R has a front-facing surface <b>66</b> and a back-facing surface <b>67</b>. Each back wall <b>44</b> also has a central back hole <b>64</b> with a generally horizontal central longitudinal axis. As shown in FIGS. 7, <b>17</b> and <b>21</b>, the front facing surface <b>66</b> of the back wall <b>44</b> may be countersunk around the central back hole <b>64</b>. As shown in FIGS. 1-4 and <b>11</b>-<b>14</b>, the center rods <b>34</b> of the draft gear assemblies <b>10</b>F, <b>10</b>E, <b>10</b>R all extend from the inboard side through the holes <b>64</b>.</p>
    <p>Each center rod <b>34</b> has a head <b>70</b> that fits within the countersunk area around the back hole <b>64</b> in the yoke back wall <b>44</b>. Each center rod <b>34</b> extends in a longitudinal inboard direction from the yoke back wall <b>44</b> through the back resilient member <b>30</b> and through the rear follower <b>32</b>. At the inboard end of the center rod <b>34</b>, a shortening member <b>36</b> is attached.</p>
    <p>In the illustrated embodiment, the shortening member <b>36</b> includes a nut <b>37</b>, shown in FIGS. 1-6, <b>11</b>-<b>16</b> and <b>19</b>-<b>20</b>, and a gag <b>38</b>, shown in FIGS. 6, <b>16</b> and <b>20</b>. The nut <b>37</b> is threaded onto the end of the center rod <b>34</b>. The gag <b>38</b> comprises a semi-cylindrical metal spacer or collar. As described below, the gag <b>38</b> is a temporary element that is designed to fall off the draft gear assembly after the first buff impact. The nut <b>37</b> may remain on the center rod <b>34</b> throughout the life of the draft gear assembly, but only functions during installation and removal of the draft gear assembly from the draft gear pocket. Accordingly, the nut <b>37</b> may be removed if desired, but it is not necessary to remove it from the draft gear system. In the illustrated embodiment, the nut <b>37</b> includes a bore aligned with a bore in the center rod <b>34</b>; a bolt <b>39</b> extends through these aligned bores as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, perpendicular to the central longitudinal axis of the center rod <b>34</b>.</p>
    <p>The center rod <b>34</b> may have a length of 22 inches and a diameter of 2.5 inches. It may be made of mild steel. It should be understood that these dimensions and this material are provided by way of example only, and that the present invention is not limited to use of such a center rod unless expressly set forth in the claims.</p>
    <p>In each illustrated draft gear assembly <b>10</b>F, <b>10</b>E, <b>10</b>R, the coupler follower <b>26</b>F, <b>26</b>E, <b>26</b>R is received within the yoke <b>24</b>F, <b>24</b>E, <b>24</b>R between the top wall <b>40</b> and bottom wall <b>42</b>. Each coupler follower is movable within the associated yoke in a forward and rearward direction. Prior to installation on the draft sill, forward movement of the coupler follower is limited by the yoke stops <b>45</b>, <b>47</b> and rearward movement is limited by the compressibility of the front resilient member <b>28</b>. After installation on the draft sill and during use, forward movement of the coupler follower is limited by the yoke stops <b>45</b>, <b>47</b> and the draft sill front stops <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p>Each of the illustrated coupler followers <b>26</b>F, <b>26</b>E and <b>26</b>R has a pair of forward-facing stop contact surfaces <b>72</b>, a forward-facing coupler bearing surface <b>74</b> and a rearward-facing back face <b>75</b>. When installed in the draft sill <b>12</b>, the stop contact surfaces <b>72</b> are generally vertical, and are adapted to contact the longitudinally inboard surfaces of the front stops <b>14</b> of the draft sill. The two stop contact surfaces <b>72</b> of each coupler follower are co-planar, and lie in plane <b>76</b> as illustrated in FIGS. 8, <b>18</b> and <b>22</b>. As shown in FIGS. 5-6, <b>15</b>-<b>16</b> and <b>19</b>-<b>20</b>, the stop contact surfaces <b>72</b> of the coupler followers <b>26</b>F, <b>26</b>E, <b>26</b>R extend laterally beyond the edges of the top and bottom walls <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> of the yokes <b>24</b>F, <b>24</b>E, <b>24</b>R.</p>
    <p>Each coupler bearing surface <b>74</b> of each coupler follower <b>26</b>F, <b>26</b>E, <b>26</b>R is positioned laterally between the associated stop contact surfaces <b>72</b>. The outboard-most part of each coupler bearing surface <b>74</b> lies in a plane <b>78</b> that is parallel to plane <b>76</b> of the contact surfaces <b>72</b>; the two planes <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> are spaced about 1¼ inches apart, as shown by distance d<b>2</b> in FIGS. 8, <b>18</b> and <b>22</b>. The shapes of the coupler bearing surfaces <b>74</b> may vary as illustrated in FIGS. 8, <b>18</b> and <b>22</b> to mate with the shape of the butt end of the associated coupler shank <b>54</b>, <b>60</b>. Either the surfaces <b>72</b> or the surface <b>74</b> may be designed to contact the yoke stop surfaces <b>45</b>, <b>47</b>. The coupler followers may be made of standard materials in standard ways, such as cast steel.</p>
    <p>In each of the illustrated embodiments, the same rear follower <b>32</b> may be used. As shown in FIGS. 9-10, each rear follower <b>32</b> includes a central hole <b>80</b>, a back face <b>82</b> and a front face <b>84</b>. Each back face <b>82</b> includes a pair of stop contact surfaces <b>86</b> that bear against the front-facing surfaces of the rear stops <b>16</b> of the draft sill <b>12</b>. The rear follower may be made of standard materials in a standard manner, such as cast steel.</p>
    <p>Each front face <b>84</b> of the rear follower <b>32</b> serves as a bearing surface for the back resilient member <b>30</b>. Each back resilient member <b>30</b> extends between the front face <b>84</b> of the rear follower <b>32</b> and the rear face <b>67</b> of the yoke back wall <b>44</b>. Each front resilient member <b>28</b> extends between the front face <b>66</b> of the yoke back wall <b>44</b> and the rear face <b>75</b> of the coupler follower <b>26</b>F, <b>26</b>E, <b>26</b>R.</p>
    <p>In the illustrated embodiments, the back resilient member <b>30</b> comprises a plurality of individual ring members <b>90</b> stacked in series. In the illustrated embodiments, there are ten individual ring members <b>90</b>. As shown in FIGS. 36-37, each ring member <b>90</b> comprises two elastomer pads <b>92</b> bonded to a central steel ring plate <b>94</b>. As shown in FIGS. 1-4 and <b>11</b>-<b>14</b>, the elastomer pads <b>92</b> of adjacent ring members <b>90</b> bear against each other. As shown in FIG. 36, each ring member <b>90</b> has a hole <b>96</b> at its center, each hole having sufficient diameter for the center rod <b>34</b> to pass through. Each illustrated ring member <b>90</b> for the back resilient member is circular in elevation view, as shown in FIG. <b>36</b>.</p>
    <p>In the illustrated embodiments, the front resilient member <b>28</b> comprises a plurality of individual pad members stacked in series. In the illustrated embodiments, there are two end pad members <b>98</b> and three intermediate pad members <b>100</b>. Each intermediate pad member <b>100</b>, as shown in FIGS. 30-32, comprises two elastomer pads <b>102</b> bonded to a central steel plate <b>104</b>. The elastomer pads <b>102</b> of adjacent intermediate pad members <b>100</b> bear against each other when stacked to form the back resilient member <b>28</b>. Each end pad member <b>98</b> comprises a steel plate <b>106</b> bonded to a single elastomer pad <b>108</b>. The steel plates <b>106</b> of the end pad members <b>98</b> bear against the coupler follower <b>26</b> and the back wall <b>44</b> of the yoke <b>24</b> and the end elastomer pads <b>108</b> bear against an adjacent elastomer pad <b>102</b> of an intermediate pad member <b>100</b>. Each illustrated pad member <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> for the front resilient member <b>28</b> is generally rectangular in elevation view, as shown in FIGS. 31 and 34.</p>
    <p>The same material may be used for the elastomer pads <b>92</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>108</b> of both the front and back resilient members <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>. For example, a synthetic rubber such as styrene-butadiene rubber of the type marketed under the trademark KEYGARD by Keystone Industries, Inc., assignee of the present application, or a synthetic rubber of the type marketed under the trademark HYTREL by E.I. DuPont deNemours and Company. However, it should be understood that other materials may be used. Preferably, the material should be capable of withstanding temperatures of −40 to 160° F.; the elastic characteristics of the material are preferably maintained at both ends of the temperature spectrum.</p>
    <p>It should be understood that although in the illustrated embodiments the two resilient members <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> are made up of stacks of individual ring members <b>90</b> or pad members <b>98</b>, <b>100</b>, such a design in not necessary. For example, larger resilient members could be used.</p>
    <p>An example of static closure characteristics or spring rates for the resilient members <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> are illustrated in FIG. <b>23</b>. The left static closure curve <b>110</b> shows force versus travel for a stack of four elastomer pad members, such as could be used for the front resilient member <b>28</b>. Essentially, the curve <b>110</b> shows a possible spring rate curve for one possible front resilient member <b>28</b>. The middle static closure <b>112</b> curve shows force versus travel for a stack of ten elastomer pad members, as could be used for the back resilient member <b>30</b>. Essentially, the curve <b>112</b> shows a possible spring rate curve for one possible back resilient member <b>30</b>. The right static closure curve <b>114</b> shows force versus travel for a stack of fourteen elastomer pad members, such as would result from use of the front and back resilient members <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> in series. Essentially, the curve <b>114</b> shows a possible spring rate curve for possible front and back resilient members <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> operating in series. As shown in FIG. 23, the front resilient member <b>28</b> may be stiffer than the back resilient member <b>30</b>: a front pad stack of 4 pads (two end pads and three intermediate pads) could move 1.25 inches in response to 1,000,000 pounds of force; a back pad stack of 10 pads could move 3 inches in response to 1,000,000 pounds of force; and a pad stack of <b>14</b> of these pads in series could move 4.25 inches in response to 1,000,000 pounds of force.</p>
    <p>The front and back resilient members <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> are compressible along the longitudinal axes of the resilient members <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, which axes are co-incident with the central longitudinal axis of the center rod <b>34</b>. The uncompressed lengths of the front and back resilient members in the illustrated embodiment are about <b>6</b> inches and 15⅝ inches, respectively. The installed lengths of the front and back resilient members may be, for example, 4.875 inches and 13.375 inches respectively for the pad stacks shown in FIG. <b>23</b>. Alternatively, the installed length for the back resilient member could be 13.125 inches. These pre-compressions give these pad stacks pre-loads. The pre-load for a front pad stack at this installed height may be 15,000 pounds, for example; the pre-load for a back pad stack at either of these heights may be 25,000-30,000 pounds, for example. It should be understood that once assembled together, the yoke will move slightly, changing the height of the pad stack as the loads in the two resilient members <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> reach equilibrium. In the neutral position shown in FIGS. 3-4 and <b>13</b>-<b>14</b>, it may be expected that the loads in the two resilient members <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> will be substantially equal, and the heights of the pad stacks will vary accordingly. Prior to installation, in the form shown in FIGS. 5-6, <b>15</b>-<b>16</b> and <b>19</b>-<b>20</b>, the pre-load in the front pad stack may be 15,000 pounds, for example, and the pre-load for the back pad stack may be about 30,000 pounds; these pre-loads will reach equilibrium after the gag falls out in use.</p>
    <p>Preferably, the material selected for the front and back resilient members <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> provides a substantially constant pre-load over the useful life of these elements, although some pre-load loss can be expected. Preferably, the pre-load is not reduced by more than 28% over a ten year life span. In addition, the compression set, that is the overall loss in height of the damping member after a few compressions, does not exceed 6-10% of the design height of the stack. Generally, after a number of cycles, the spring rate will follow the curves shown in FIG. <b>23</b>. It should be understood that the invention is not limited to such materials; one may design the system to accommodate other pre-load reductions and compression sets if desired.</p>
    <p>As discussed below, in buff the front and back resilient members <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> operate in series. A draft gear assembly using resilient members as described above in series may react to buff impacts in the manner shown in FIGS. 24-29. FIGS. 24-29 are dynamic impact plots for buff impact of a draft gear assembly utilizing the principles of the present invention, with front and back resilient members operating in series, and using an elastomer material that has hysteresis. In each graph, the upper curve <b>116</b> illustrates the action of the two resilient members <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> during compression, and the lower curve <b>118</b> indicates the two resilient members <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> during expansion following the compression. The complete cycle of compression and expansion in response to a buff impact comprises a hysteresis loop, with energy being dissipated during the cycle. With such energy dissipation, the elastomer stacks operate not only as springs, but also as damping members. Thus, FIGS. 24-29 show an example of damping characteristics for a suitable material.</p>
    <p>It should be understood that the hysteresis loops of FIGS. 24-29 are provided by way of example only. A different pre-load on the pad stacks may shift the curves somewhat, and different materials may have different hysteresis loops. In addition, it may be desirable to vary the material, pad height or other characteristic so that the total buff travel is at most 4.25 inches at 1 million pounds of force and a speed of 8 mph. The present invention is not limited to any material providing any particular hysteresis loop, damping characteristic or pre-load unless expressly set forth in the claims. Although materials with hysteresis are desirable in that they provide a force damping function, materials with only marginal hysteresis, and not providing any appreciable damping, should be understood as falling within the expression “resilient member”. The expression “resilient member” is intended to encompass elements that serve the functions of both springs and force dampers, as well as materials that provide the spring function but not a force damping function; the force damping function could be provided by a separate element.</p>
    <p>Other types of resilient members may be used. Instead of a stack of elastomer pads, it may be desirable to use buff media having a greater spring rate. Moreover, one or more friction spring elements could be used as the front or back resilient member <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>. Friction springs generally have a plurality of interfitted circular rings with engaged conical friction surfaces. During impact, the rings are stressed and slide against one another. Impact energy is stored and dissipated. In addition, instead of elastomers, compressible fluids, liquid elastomers or hydraulics could be used as part of the resilient members. Synthetic and natural elastomers can be used, as well as combinations of elastomers and other materials such as metal. Other energy absorption media that are developed in the future may be used. Finally, the front and rear damping members need not be made of the same material.</p>
    <p>The draft gear assemblies are assembled into the structures illustrated in FIGS. 5-6, <b>15</b>-<b>16</b> and <b>19</b>-<b>20</b> by inserting the center rod <b>34</b> through the hole <b>64</b> in the back wall of the yoke <b>24</b>F, <b>24</b>E or <b>24</b>R until the head <b>70</b> of the center rod <b>34</b> is received in the countersink in the back wall of the yoke. The rear pad stack or back resilient member <b>30</b> is then placed on the stem of the center rod <b>34</b> and the rear follower <b>32</b> is then placed on the end of the center rod <b>34</b>. The threaded end of the center rod <b>34</b> extends out through the hole <b>80</b> in the rear follower <b>32</b>. Next, the gag <b>38</b> is placed on the end of the center rod <b>34</b>, and the nut <b>37</b> is then threaded onto the back end of the center rod <b>34</b> and tightened against the gag <b>38</b>. As the nut <b>37</b> is tightened, the gag <b>38</b> pushes against the rear follower <b>32</b>, compressing the back resilient member <b>30</b>. The nut is tightened until the distance between the rear face <b>82</b> of the rear follower <b>32</b> and the back face of the yoke stops <b>45</b>, <b>47</b> is less than 24⅝ inches, the length of the draft gear pocket <b>18</b> so that the assembly can easily fit into the draft gear pocket.</p>
    <p>The front resilient member <b>28</b> and the coupler follower <b>26</b>F, <b>26</b>E, <b>26</b>R may be placed in the yoke <b>24</b>F, <b>24</b>E, <b>24</b>R any time after the center rod <b>34</b> is placed through the back wall of the yoke. The front resilient member <b>28</b> may be compressed with a standard tool. The front resilient member <b>28</b> pushes against the front face <b>66</b> of the yoke back wall <b>44</b> and the back face <b>75</b> of the coupler follower <b>26</b>F, <b>26</b>E, <b>26</b>R, pushing the coupler follower forward against the yoke stops <b>45</b>, <b>47</b>. The draft gear assembly <b>10</b>F, <b>10</b>E, <b>10</b>R then appears as shown in FIGS. 5-6, <b>15</b>-<b>16</b> or <b>19</b>-<b>20</b>.</p>
    <p>The draft gear assembly <b>10</b>F, <b>10</b>E, <b>10</b>R as shown in FIGS. 5-6, <b>15</b>-<b>16</b> or <b>19</b>-<b>20</b> may then be relatively easily installed in a draft sill <b>12</b> by placing the assembly <b>10</b>F, <b>10</b>E, or <b>10</b>R into the draft gear pocket <b>18</b>. Since the distance between the plane of the coupler follower stop contact surfaces <b>72</b> and the plane of the rear follower contact surfaces <b>82</b> is slightly less than the length of the draft gear pocket <b>18</b>, the assembly <b>10</b>F, <b>10</b>E, <b>10</b>R may be installed without additional effort to compress the pad stacks <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>.</p>
    <p>Once the draft gear assembly <b>10</b>F, <b>10</b>E or <b>10</b>R is in place in the draft sill <b>12</b>, a standard support member may be attached to the draft sill flanges to support the weight of the draft gear assembly. The coupler may then be connected to the yoke <b>24</b>F, <b>24</b>E, or <b>24</b>R by inserting the pin or key <b>52</b> or <b>59</b> through the aligned holes or slots <b>48</b> or <b>58</b> of the yoke. Since the holes or slots <b>48</b>, <b>58</b> of the yoke are elongated, and since the yoke stops <b>45</b>, <b>47</b> restrain forward movement of the coupler follower <b>26</b>F, <b>26</b>E, <b>26</b>R, the pin or key <b>52</b>, <b>59</b> may be inserted without first further compressing the front resilient member <b>28</b>. The sizes of the holes or slots <b>48</b>, <b>58</b> and positions of the yoke stops <b>45</b>, <b>47</b> and draft sill front stops <b>14</b> are such as to prevent the coupler follower and resilient members <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> from axially loading the coupler shank. The entire draft system is then ready for service.</p>
    <p>An initial buff impact experienced by the draft system pushes the yoke <b>24</b>F, <b>24</b>E, <b>24</b>R and front resilient member <b>28</b> back, thereby also pushing the center rod <b>34</b> back. As the center rod is pushed back, the space between the nut <b>37</b> and the back face <b>82</b> of the rear follower <b>32</b> increases and the gag <b>38</b> falls out. With the gag <b>38</b> gone, the back resilient member <b>30</b> and front resilient member <b>28</b> expand to the greatest extent allowed by the draft sill rear stops <b>16</b> and front stops <b>14</b>. The resilient members <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> expand, pushing the yoke forward until the stop contact surfaces <b>72</b> of the coupler follower <b>26</b>F, <b>26</b>E, or <b>26</b>R are biased against the draft sill front stops <b>14</b> and the stop contact surfaces <b>86</b> of the rear follower <b>32</b> are biased against the contact surfaces of the draft sill rear stops <b>16</b>. The draft system is then in the neutral position as shown in FIGS. 3-4 and <b>13</b>-<b>14</b>. The front and back resilient members <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> do not place any axial load on the coupler shank; the coupler shank may be slightly spaced from the coupler follower.</p>
    <p>To reach the neutral position, the pre-loads in the front and back resilient members <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> will reach an equilibrium, and the yoke <b>24</b>F, <b>24</b>E, <b>24</b>R will move longitudinally accordingly. At the equilibrium position, the pre-load may be, for example, 25,000-30,000 pounds in both resilient members <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>. It should be understood that these pre-loads are identified for purposes of illustration only and that the present invention is not limited to any particular pre-load unless expressly set forth in the claims. Dimensions of parts such as the yoke back wall <b>44</b> and the rear follower <b>32</b> can be changed to change the distances shown at d<b>6</b> and d<b>7</b> to thereby adjust the degree of compression of the resilient members <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> to adjust the pre-load.</p>
    <p>When the pre-loads in the front and back resilient members <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> have reached equilibrium, the front resilient member <b>28</b> has a length shown at d<b>3</b> in FIGS. 4 and 14, and the back resilient member <b>30</b> has a length shown at d<b>4</b> in FIGS. 4 and 14. The coupler horn <b>23</b> is spaced from the front <b>21</b> of the draft sill or striker a distance shown at d<b>5</b> in FIGS. 3 and 14. Examples of lengths and distances are: 4⅞ (4.88) for d<b>3</b>; 15⅛ (13.13) for d<b>4</b>; and 4¾ (4.75) for d<b>5</b>. In addition to pre-load, these distances can be expected to vary depending on factors such as compression set and pre-load loss. Moreover, as the two resilient members reach equilibrium, d<b>3</b> may be expected to be slightly less and d<b>4</b> may be expected to be slightly greater.</p>
    <p>With the shape of the coupler followers <b>26</b>F, <b>26</b>E and <b>26</b>R of the present invention, the contact surface <b>74</b> of the coupler <b>22</b>F, <b>22</b>E, <b>22</b>R is offset forwardly by about 1¼ inches. The coupler is also offset forward by a distance of about 1¼ inches.</p>
    <p>When a draft load, that is, a load tending to pull the coupler in a longitudinally outboard direction, greater than about 25,000-30,000 pounds is experienced, the coupler <b>22</b>F, <b>22</b>E or <b>22</b>R moves longitudinally outboard toward the direction shown at <b>2</b> in FIGS. 1-4 and <b>11</b>-<b>14</b>. The draft system should reach the full draft position shown in FIGS. 1 and 11 when the coupler receives a load of 650,000 pounds, nominally, in the illustrated embodiment. The coupler and the yoke both move in response to a draft impact. The full draft stroke for the coupler <b>22</b>F, <b>22</b>E and yoke <b>24</b>F, <b>24</b>E, <b>24</b>R is 1¼ (1.25) inches, nominally.</p>
    <p>In the full draft position, the coupler pulls against the coupler pin or key <b>52</b>, <b>59</b> which pulls the yoke forward a distance of about 1.25 nominal inches, compressing the front resilient member <b>28</b> to a length shown at d<b>6</b> in FIGS. 1 and 11. Simultaneously, the back resilient member <b>30</b> expands by 1¼ inches to a length shown at d<b>7</b> in FIGS. 1 and 11. In the full draft position, the distance between the coupler horn <b>23</b> and the front end <b>21</b> of the draft sill <b>12</b> increases to the distance shown at d<b>8</b> in FIGS. 1 and 11. In the full draft position, the rear follower surfaces <b>86</b> remain pressed against the front faces of the draft sill rear stops <b>16</b>, and the coupler follower stop surfaces <b>72</b> remain pressed against the back faces of the draft sill front stops <b>14</b>. Thus, the rear follower and coupler follower do not move in response to a draft impact. And since the back resilient member <b>30</b> expands to maintain contact with the yoke and the rear follower during the draft stroke, there is no slack between the coupler follower and the rear follower in draft. Examples of values for the lengths and distances at full draft are: 3⅝ (3/63) inches for d<b>6</b>; 14⅜ (14.38) inches for d<b>7</b>; and 6 inches for d<b>8</b>.</p>
    <p>When the draft load is removed, the front resilient member <b>28</b> expands, and the coupler and yoke return to the neutral position shown in FIGS. 3-4 and <b>13</b>-<b>14</b>. The lengths of the pad stacks <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> return to the neutral lengths d<b>3</b>, d<b>4</b> as well.</p>
    <p>When the coupler experiences a buff load, that is, a load pushing the coupler in the inboard direction toward the reference <b>4</b> in FIGS. 1-4 and <b>11</b>-<b>14</b>, the butt end of the coupler shank <b>54</b>, <b>60</b> pushes against the coupler follower <b>26</b>F, <b>26</b>E or <b>26</b>R, pushing the coupler follower back if the load exceeds 25,000-30,000 pounds. As the coupler follower is pushed back, it compresses the front resilient member <b>28</b> against the back wall <b>44</b> of the yoke, and the front resilient member <b>28</b> pushes the yoke back wall <b>44</b> back to compress the back resilient member <b>30</b>. The full buff position of the draft gear assembly is reached under a compressive load of 1,000,000 pounds, nominally. This full buff position is shown in FIGS. 2 and 12.</p>
    <p>At the full buff position, the length of the front resilient member <b>28</b> is compressed by 1¼ inches the length shown at d<b>9</b> in FIGS. 2 and 12. At the full buff position, the length of the back resilient member <b>30</b> is compressed by 3 inches to the length shown at d<b>10</b> in FIGS. 2 and 12. Thus, the total buff stroke for the coupler <b>22</b>F, <b>22</b>E, <b>22</b>R and coupler follower <b>26</b>F, <b>26</b>E, <b>26</b>R is 4¼ (4.25) inches, and the total buff stroke for the yoke <b>24</b>F, <b>24</b>E, <b>24</b>R is 3 inches. Accordingly, the distance between the coupler horn <b>23</b> and the front <b>21</b> of the draft sill <b>12</b> is shortened to d<b>11</b> at the full buff position. Examples of values for the lengths and distances at full buff are: 3⅝ (3.63) inches for d<b>9</b>; 10⅛ (10.13) inches for d<b>10</b>; and ½ inch for d<b>11</b>.</p>
    <p>It should be understood that under extremely high loads or at relatively high speeds, the coupler may continue to move back through the last ½ inch, and may contact the striker on the front end <b>21</b> of the draft sill <b>12</b>. Accordingly, although it is generally undesirable in this design, the coupler head could have a full buff stroke of 4¾ inches, nominally. Thus, as shown in FIG. 29, the distance traveled by the coupler during the full buff stroke may exceed the 4.25 inches of buff travel provided by the draft gear assembly. The expression “full buff position” should be understood to encompass a coupler buff stroke of 4¼ to 4¾ inches.</p>
    <p>It should also be understood that the dimensions, lengths and distances set forth above are nominal ones. Normal manufacturing tolerances may vary these dimensions, lengths and distances. Dimensions, lengths and distances stated in this description and in the claims should be understood to include variations due to normal tolerances. In addition, unless expressly set forth in the claims, the invention is not limited to any particular dimension, length or distance.</p>
    <p>Compression setting of the resilient members <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, may affect the length of the draft stroke and buff stroke. Accordingly, references to the length of the buff or draft stroke of any part in the claims should be understood as referring to a design value, a value that may change over time with use and wear. Thus, reference to a full draft position or draft stroke of 1¼ inches should be understood as including positions and draft strokes that vary from this length with compression set and loss of pre-load.</p>
    <p>Throughout buff movement of the draft system coupler and yoke, there is no contact between the coupler pin or key <b>52</b>, <b>59</b>, and the yoke <b>24</b>F, <b>24</b>E, <b>24</b>R. The coupler pin or key <b>52</b>, <b>59</b> is thus not stressed during buff movement of the yoke <b>24</b>F, <b>24</b>E, <b>24</b>R. It is only during draft movement of the yoke that the yoke contacts the coupler pin or key.</p>
    <p>The front and back resilient members <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> bias the coupler follower <b>26</b>F, <b>26</b>E, <b>26</b>R forward toward the yoke top and bottom stops <b>45</b>, <b>47</b>, toward the draft sill front stops <b>14</b>, and toward the butt end of the coupler shank <b>54</b>, <b>60</b>. There is a small amount of slack between the coupler follower and the butt end of the shank in the illustrated embodiments at the neutral position and during draft movement of the coupler and yoke. The rear follower <b>32</b> remains biased against the rear stops <b>16</b> of the draft sill <b>12</b> throughout the range of motion of the other elements of the draft system. Thus, the draft gear assembly of the present invention is substantially slack free in the pocket in draft. However, in the situation where a draft event follows a buff event, it is expected that there will be some slack in the system at the start of the draft event.</p>
    <p>The small amount of slack between the coupler follower and butt end of the shank is desirable to prevent axial loading of the butt end of the shank. Such loading could cause undesirable friction which could inhibit turning of the coupler shank. This slack accounts for some of the movement shown in FIGS. 24-29 at low loads.</p>
    <p>Once the gag <b>38</b> falls from the system, the center rod <b>34</b> is free from stress. At the full draft position, the nut <b>37</b> is spaced slightly from the back face <b>82</b> of the rear follower <b>32</b>, so there is no tension on the center rod <b>34</b>. At the full buff position, the center rod <b>34</b> moves rearward with the yoke, but the rear end of the center rod <b>34</b> does not contact any other element; the center rod <b>34</b> is free from compressive stress. At the neutral position, the center rod <b>34</b> is free from tension and compression. Although free from tension and compression, the center rod <b>34</b> functions to guide the back resilient member <b>30</b> to prevent buckling of the back resilient member <b>30</b>.</p>
    <p>It should be understood that the yokes <b>24</b>F, <b>24</b>E, <b>24</b>R could be made without the top and bottom stops <b>45</b>, <b>47</b>. Instead, the yoke could be provided with shear pins that hold the coupler follower in position during initial assembly, and that shear off after some initial shock so that the coupler follower bears directly against the butt of the coupler shank. However, the stops <b>45</b>, <b>47</b> are desirable in that they simplify removal of the draft gear assembly from the draft sill.</p>
    <p>To remove the assembly for replacement, a pillow-block collar can be installed at the rear follower, over the extended center rod, and the nut can be tightened to compress the buff pad stack. Then, a standard draft gear removal tool can be used to push the front follower off of the front stop <b>14</b>, enabling the draft gear assembly to be dropped out of the draft gear pocket.</p>
    <p>The draft gear assembly and system of the present invention offers several advantages. The draft gear assembly of the present invention provides for relatively long travel in buff −4.25 inches—while utilizing the same available standard draft gear pocket, and without modifying the draft gear pocket. The draft gear assembly of the present invention also has separate draft and buff capacities. In buff, the two resilient members <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> work in series to provide the total buff travel capacity of 4.25 inches while only one energy absorber works in draft. In addition, the elongated key slot or pin hole in the yoke allows for full buff travel without loading the pin or key. In draft there is a shorter travel of 1.25 inches; since excessive movement in the draft direction contributes to the severity of the shocks, the present invention provides a compromise between absorbing the energy of draft shocks and limiting the amount of movement in the connection. And since the rear energy absorber should expand to fill any gap during draft impacts, free slack normally created by pulling the train will not exist.</p>
    <p>In addition, installation, removal and coupler change-out may be accomplished without any special tools. The center rod and shortening member allow the assembly to be pre-shortened to easily fit within the draft gear pocket. The larger slot or hole allows the pin or key to be slipped through the aligned slots or holes without pre-shortening the front pad stack <b>28</b>. And removal can be accomplished with standard equipment already typically available.</p>
    <p>It should be understood that although advantages of the illustrated embodiments have been identified, it is not necessary that all of the possible advantageous features of the present invention be used. Individual features of the invention may be employed without using other features. The claims should not be interpreted as requiring a particular feature or advantage unless expressly set forth in the claim.</p>
    <p>While only specific embodiments of the invention have been described and shown, it is apparent that various alterations and modifications can be made therein. For example, instead of a separate yoke and coupler follower with a force absorbing element between them, a combination yoke and follower could be used, with a pair of laterally spaced force dampers in front of the yoke/follower and behind the draft sill stops. It is, therefore, the intention in the appended claims to cover all such modifications and alterations as may fall within the scope and spirit of the invention. Moreover, the invention is intended to include equivalent structures and structural equivalents to those described herein.</p>
