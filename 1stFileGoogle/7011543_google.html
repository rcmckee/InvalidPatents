<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
  <p num="p-0003">The present invention relates to an electric connector having a retention structure for preventing an insulated wire from coming off in the vertical direction at right angles to the wire axial direction.</p>
  <p num="p-0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
  <p num="p-0005">A connector attached to an insulated wire has a resin housing and a contact (terminal metal fitting) secured to the housing. When there is used an insulation displacement contact having the arrangement that a slot for holding the core wire portion of an insulated wire is formed between a pair of insulation displacement blades for breaking up the insulation of the insulated wire, the contact and the core wire portion of the insulated wire can electrically be connected to each other merely by pushing the insulated wire into the slot of the insulation displacement contact. A connector using such an insulation displacement contact is called an insulation displacement connector.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">In an insulation displacement connector, the retention force in the axial direction of an insulated wire (axial retention force) is obtained by nipping the core wire portion by the contact. However, the slot of the insulation displacement contact is opened in the vertical direction at right angles to the axial direction of the insulated wire. Therefore, when the wire is held only by the contact, the retention force in the vertical direction above-mentioned (orthogonal retention force) is insufficient. Accordingly, the housing has a retention structure for the insulation of the insulated wire.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">More specifically, the housing is provided, in its position out of alignment with the contact in the axial direction of the insulated wire, with a wire holding groove for housing an insulated wire. Formed at the opening edges of the wire holding groove are wire hold-down pieces or strain relief pieces which project inwardly of the wire holding groove. At the same time when an insulated wire is mounted on an insulation displacement contact, the insulation of the wire is pushed to the wire hold-down pieces. As a result, the wire hold-down pieces are resiliently deformed and the wire holding groove is resiliently expanded and deformed. When the insulated wire gets over the wire hold-down pieces and is then housed in the wire holding groove, the wire hold-down pieces and the wire holding groove are restored in shape. Accordingly, when an external force is thereafter exerted, to the wire held in the wire holding groove, in the direction in which the wire is pulled out from the wire holding groove, the insulated wire is held within the wire holding groove under the action of the wire hold-down pieces. Thus, provision is made such that a sufficient orthogonal retention force is obtained (Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication 2001-203008).</p>
  <p num="p-0008">A connector to which a plurality of wires are connected, has contacts and wire holding grooves which respectively correspond to these wires. A plurality of wire holding grooves are formed in a row. However, when a plurality of wires are simultaneously mounted on the connector, the plurality of wire holding grooves are simultaneously expanded and opened. This causes the housing to be re-markably bent and deformed.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">A connector used in a small-size device such as a digital still camera, a video camera, a cellular phone, a PDA (personal digital assistant) and the like, is extremely miniaturized in size, and is a multi-pole connector having a number of poles. When such a miniaturized and multi-pole connector is remarkably bent and deformed as above-mentioned, this involves the likelihood that the housing is broken in the step of mounting the insulated wires.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">Further, in a miniaturized multi-pole connector, it can hardly be expected to resiliently deform the wire hold-down pieces due to their marginal miniaturization. Further, the insulations of insulated wires connected to the miniaturized multi-pole connector are very low in thickness. Thus, the deformation of the insulations can hardly be expected. Accordingly, the insertion of the insulated wires into the wire holding grooves has to rely solely on the resilient expansion and deformation of the wire holding grooves. Therefore, when the insulated wires are press-fitted, the housing is remarkably bent and deformed. This involves the likelihood that the housing is broken.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">On the other hand, unless the housing is sufficiently bent and deformed, a plurality of insulated wires cannot be inserted into the wire holding grooves.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">This dilemma can be solved by adopting the wire insertion method disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication 2002-260803. According to this prior art, the insulated wires are inserted in two steps including a first insertion step of pushing wires every other pole collectively into the housing by a punch, and a second insertion step of pushing wires every another pole collectively into the housing by another punch. It is there fore possible to insert the insulated wires into the housing without the housing remarkably bent and deformed at each insertion step.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">According to this method, however, the wire insertion has to be divided into two steps, thus lowering the productivity. Further, a special punch has to be provided for holding down the wires every other pole.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0014">It is an object of the present invention to provide an electric connector in which a plurality of insulated wires are respectively held by a plurality of wire holding portions with excellent productivity without the housing remarkably bent and deformed.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">The present invention relates to an electric connector having a housing in which there are disposed, side by side, a plurality of wire holding portions for holding the insulations of insulated wires of which core wire portions are covered by the insulations. According to the present invention, each wire holding portion comprises: a pair of wire holding pieces disposed as facing each other to form a wire holding groove for receiving an insulated wire; and wire hold-down pieces or strain relief pieces not only for guiding, in the vertical direction at right angles to the axial direction of the insulated wire, the insertion of the insulated wire into the wire holding groove, but also for preventing the insulated wire from coming off from the wire holding groove. The plurality of wire holding portions comprise: a first wire holding portion having wire hold-down pieces arranged to hold an insulated wire in the wire holding groove at a first wire hold-down position with respect to the axial direction of the insulated wire; and a second wire holding portion disposed adjacent to the first wire holding portion, and having wire hold-down pieces arranged to hold an insulated wire in the wire holding groove at a second wire hold-down position different from the first wire hold-down position with respect to the axial direction of the insulated wire.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">According to the arrangement above-mentioned, in the adjacent first and second wire holding portions, the respective wire hold-down positions by the wire hold-down pieces are misaligned with each other in the axial direction of the insulated wires. Accordingly, even though wires are simultaneously inserted into the wire holding grooves of the first and second wire holding portions, this does not cause the housing to be greatly deformed. More specifically, the position where the pair of wire holding pieces forming the first wire holding portion are resiliently expanded and opened when an insulated wire is inserted into the first wire holding portion in the vertical direction substantially at right angles to the wire axial direction, is shifted, in the insulated wire axial direction, from the position where the pair of wire holding pieces forming the second wire holding portion are resiliently expanded and opened when an insulated wire is inserted into the second wire holding portion. Accordingly, the expanding and opening of the wire holding pieces (the expanding and opening of the wire holding groove) of the first wire holding portion, and the expanding and opening of the wire holding pieces (the expanding and opening of the wire holding groove) of the second wire holding portion, can simultaneously be carried out without any interference with each other. As the result, even though insulated wires are simultaneously inserted respectively into the wire holding grooves of the first and second wire holding portions, this does not cause the housing to be greatly deformed. In other words, even though the housing cannot be resiliently greatly deformed due to its structure (for example, when the housing is very small), insulated wires can simultaneously be inserted into the first and second wire holding portions without any special difficulty.</p>
  <p num="p-0017">Accordingly, in the less number of times (for example, one time), a plurality of insulated wires can respectively be inserted in and held by the plurality of wire holding portions.</p>
  <p num="p-0018">The wire hold-down pieces may be formed as projecting as if closing portions of the wire holding grooves at the lateral edges thereof.</p>
  <p num="p-0019">The plurality of wire holding portions may comprise: the first wire holding portion above-mentioned in plural number; and the second wire holding portion above-mentioned in plural number. These first and second wire holding portions may be alternately disposed in the housing.</p>
  <p num="p-0020">In such a case, the wire hold-down pieces are disposed in zigzags.</p>
  <p num="p-0021">According to the arrangement above-mentioned, since the first and second wire holding portions are alternately disposed, the adjacent wire holding portions do not interfere with each other at any position thereof as to the expansion and deformation of the wire holding pieces. This enables, for example, all the insulated wires to be simultaneously inserted into the wire holding portions, respectively, thus remarkably improving the productivity.</p>
  <p num="p-0022">The plurality of wire holding portions are preferably arranged such that three arbitrary adjacent wire holding portions comprise at least one first wire holding portion above-mentioned and at least one second wire holding portion above-mentioned.</p>
  <p num="p-0023">According to the arrangement above-mentioned, as to three arbitrary adjacent wire holding portions, there is no possibility of three first wire holding portions being disposed in succession, and there is no possibility of three second wire holding portions being disposed in succession. More specifically, there is no possibility of three wire holding portions having wire hold-down pieces which hold wires at the same position in the axial direction of the insulated wire. For example, even though two first wire holding portions are adjacent to each other, the second wire holding portion is positioned adjacent to the first wire holding portions. In such a case, when inserting insulated wires, two adjacent first wire holding portions interfere with each other as to the resilient deformation of the wire holding pieces in one direction, but do not interfere with each other as to the resilient deformation of the wire holding pieces in the other direction. Accordingly, the insulated wires can successfully be mounted without the housing greatly deformed and without the housing required to be greatly deformed.</p>
  <p num="p-0024">Preferably, the plurality of wire holding portions further comprise a third wire holding portion which is disposed adjacent to the first or second wire holding portion, and which has wire hold-down pieces arranged to hold an insulated wire in the wire holding groove at a third wire hold-down position different from the first and second wire hold-down positions with respect to the axial direction of the insulated wire.</p>
  <p num="p-0025">According to the arrangement above-mentioned, the wire hold-down positions are dispersed at three different positions with respect to the axial direction of the insulated wire. This further reduces the mutual interference, as to the expansion and deformation, of the wire holding pieces forming the wire holding portions, thus further restraining the housing from being deformed at the time when insulated wires are pressed. Further, even though the housing can be deformed only in a very small amount, the insulated wires can successfully be inserted.</p>
  <p num="p-0026">The present invention may be arranged such that the plurality of wire holding portions comprise the first wire holding portion above-mentioned in plural number, the second wire holding portion above-mentioned in plural number, and the third wire holding portion above-mentioned in plural number, and that the first, second and third wire holding portions are disposed, for example cyclically, such that the wire holding portions of the same type are not disposed adjacent to each other. Accordingly, the wire hold-down pieces can be arranged in zigzags in three rows. This not only effectively restrains the housing from being deformed, but also enables the insulated wires to be smoothly mounted without the housing required to be greatly deformed.</p>
  <p num="p-0027">Preferably, each wire hold-down piece has: a guiding inclined face which faces the outside of a wire holding groove and which is arranged to guide an insulated wire into the wire holding groove; and a wire regulating face which faces the inner bottom of the wire holding groove. More specifically, the guiding inclined face is a face inclined from a tip edge of the wire holding piece toward the inner bottom of the wire holding groove, and the wire regulating face is a face substantially at right angles to the wire insertion direction or a face inclined from the edge connected to the wire holding piece toward the inner bottom of the wire holding groove.</p>
  <p num="p-0028">Preferably, the housing comprises contact holding portions which are disposed at the inner parts of the wire holding grooves and which hold contacts (terminal metal fittings) to be coupled and electrically connected to the core wire portions of the insulated wires, the contacts being held by the contact holding portions. Preferably, each of the contacts is an insulation displacement contact having a pair of insulation displacement blades which form a slot for receiving the core wire portion of an insulated wire. According to the arrangement above-mentioned, when an insulated wire is pressed into the slot, the insulation displacement blades tear the insulation, causing the inside core wire portion to come in contact with the insulation displacement blades. This achieves the electric connection between the core wire portion and the contact.</p>
  <p num="p-0029">Wire hold-down pieces may be formed at each pair of wire holding pieces defining a wire holding groove. At this time, it is enough that at least one of a pair of wire hold-down pieces of the first wire holding portion, is positionally shifted, in the axial direction of the insulated wire, from at least one of a pair of wire hold-down pieces of the second wire holding portion.</p>
  <p num="p-0030">The plurality of wire holding portions may hold a plurality of insulated wires in parallel to one another, for example in a predetermined plane.</p>
  <p num="p-0031">The plurality of wire holding portions may be arranged such that each wire holding piece is shared with adjacent wire holding portions. More specifically, each wire holding piece may define parts of a pair of adjacent wire holding grooves.</p>

The electric connector <b>1</b> according to this embodiment is a wire-side connector connected to a plurality of insulated wires <b>2</b>. This wire-side connector <b>1</b> can be connected, for example, to a board-side connector <b>4</b> surface-mounted on a printed circuit board <b>3</b>. When the wire-side connector <b>1</b> is connected to the board-side connector <b>4</b>, the insulated wires <b>2</b> are electrically connected to the printed circuit board <b>3</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0045"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are perspective views of the wire-side connector <b>1</b> with its actual upside turned down. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the wire-side connector <b>1</b> as viewed from the rear side to which the insulated wires <b>2</b> are to be connected, while <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the wire-side connector <b>1</b> as viewed from the front side (from the board-side connector <b>4</b>). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a bottom view of the wire-side connector <b>1</b> when viewed from the direction of an arrow R<b>1</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0046">This wire-side connector <b>1</b> comprises a housing <b>11</b> made of a synthetic resin molded article, and insulation displacement contacts (terminal metal fittings) <b>12</b> press-fitted into and held by the housing <b>11</b>. This housing <b>11</b> is formed substantially in a rectangular parallelepiped box. The housing <b>11</b> is provided at the front face <b>13</b> side thereof with a plurality of groove-shape contact holding portions <b>15</b> which are opened in the bottom (the side opposite to the printed circuit board <b>3</b> when actually used) <b>14</b> and which are arranged along the widthwise direction <b>16</b> of the housing <b>11</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0047">The contact holding portions <b>15</b> are formed along the axial direction <b>17</b> of the insulated wires <b>2</b> at right angles to the width wise direction <b>16</b>. The contact holding portions <b>15</b> are arranged to hold insulation displacement contacts <b>12</b> which can be press-fitted into the contact holding portions <b>15</b> from the bottom face <b>14</b> side of the housing <b>11</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0048">At positions nearer to the rear face <b>18</b> of the housing <b>11</b> rather than to the contact holding portions <b>15</b>, a plurality of wire holding portions <b>20</b> respectively corresponding to the contact holding portions <b>15</b>, are formed along the widthwise direction <b>16</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0049"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a bottom view illustrating, in enlargement, a portion of the arrangement shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a back view illustrating, in enlargement, the arrangement of the wire holding portions <b>20</b> as viewed from the direction of the arrow R<b>2</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>. Each wire holding portion <b>20</b> has a pair of oppositely disposed wire holding pieces <b>21</b> and wire hold-down pieces or strain relief pieces <b>22</b> which project from the tip ends of the wire holding pieces <b>21</b>. The wire holding pieces <b>21</b> are formed like walls extending along the height direction <b>19</b> of the housing <b>11</b>. Each pair of opposite wire holding pieces <b>21</b> form a wire holding groove <b>23</b> for housing and holding the insulation of an insulated wire <b>2</b>. Each wire holding piece <b>21</b> is shared with adjacent two wire holding portions <b>20</b>. One surface and the other surface of each wire holding piece <b>21</b> respectively define portions of the wire holding grooves <b>23</b> of adjacent wire holding portions <b>20</b>. The wire holding grooves <b>23</b> are opened in the rear face <b>18</b> of the housing <b>11</b> and also opened in the bottom face <b>14</b> of the housing <b>11</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0050">The wire hold-down pieces <b>22</b> project, from the tip edges (the lower end edges in the actual usage state) of the wire holding pieces <b>21</b>, as if covering the wire holding grooves <b>23</b>. Each wire hold-down piece <b>22</b> has a guiding inclined face <b>25</b> for guiding the insertion of an insulated wire <b>2</b> from the bottom face <b>14</b> side, and a wire regulating face <b>26</b> for preventing the insulated wire <b>2</b> housed in the wire holding groove <b>23</b> from coming out toward the bottom face <b>14</b>. The guiding inclined faces <b>25</b> face the outside of the wire holding grooves <b>23</b> and are inclined from the tips of the wire holding pieces <b>21</b> toward the inner parts of the wire holding grooves <b>23</b>. The wire regulating faces <b>26</b> face the inner parts of the wire holding grooves <b>23</b> and are flat faces substantially parallel to the bottom face <b>14</b> of the housing <b>11</b>. As shown by chain double-dashed lines <b>29</b>, the wire regulating faces <b>26</b> may be inclined from the edges connected to the wire holding pieces <b>21</b> toward the inner parts of the wire holding grooves <b>23</b>. However, when the wire-side connector <b>1</b> is very small in size, it is often difficult to process the wire regulating faces <b>26</b> into such inclined faces.</p>
  <p num="p-0051">In each wire holding portion <b>20</b>, the wire hold-down pieces <b>22</b> project, substantially symmetrically with each other, from the tips of a pair of opposite wire holding pieces <b>21</b> into the wire holding groove <b>23</b>. The distance d<b>1</b> between each pair of wire hold-down pieces <b>22</b> is defined as smaller than the outer diameter of each insulated wire <b>2</b> and as slightly larger than the diameter of the core wire portion of each insulated wire <b>2</b>. Accordingly, when pressing the insulated wires <b>2</b> into the wire holding grooves <b>23</b>, the insulated wires <b>2</b> are first guided by the guiding inclined faces <b>25</b> and then introduced into the inner parts of the wire holding grooves <b>23</b> while the pairs of wire holding pieces <b>21</b> are resiliently expanded and deformed. When the insulated wires <b>2</b> go past the wire hold-down pieces <b>22</b> and reach the inner parts of the wire holding grooves <b>23</b>, the wire holding pieces <b>21</b> are restored to the original postures, and the wire regulating faces <b>26</b> become opposite to the insulated wires <b>2</b> in the wire holding grooves <b>23</b>. This prevents the insulated wires <b>2</b> from coming off from the wire holding grooves <b>23</b>, thus assuring a sufficient orthogonal retention force.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the wire holding portions <b>20</b> are classified into first wire holding portions <b>20</b>A and second wire holding portions <b>20</b>B, based on first and second wire hold-down positions P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b> which are the actuating positions of the wire hold-down pieces <b>22</b>. More specifically, in each first wire holding portion <b>20</b>A, a pair of wire hold-down pieces <b>22</b> face to each other at a position nearer to the rear face <b>18</b> of the housing <b>11</b>, this position serving as the first wire hold-down position P<b>1</b>. On the other hand, in each second wire holding portion <b>20</b>B, a pair of wire hold-down pieces <b>22</b> face to each other at a position nearer to the contact holding portions <b>15</b>, this position serving as the second wire hold-down position P<b>2</b>. More specifically, the wire hold-down positions P<b>1</b> of the first wire holding portions <b>20</b>A and the wire hold-down positions P<b>2</b> of the second wire holding portions <b>20</b>B, are out of aligned with each other with respect to the axial direction <b>17</b> of the insulated wires <b>2</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0053">The plurality of wire holding portions <b>20</b> comprise the first wire holding portion <b>20</b>A above-mentioned in plural number and the second wire holding portion <b>20</b>B above-mentioned in plural number, these portions <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B being alternately arranged. Accordingly, the respective wire hold-down positions of adjacent wire holding portions <b>20</b>, are shifted back and forth along the axial direction of the insulated wires <b>2</b>, and are there fore arranged in zigzags as a whole.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">When a plurality of insulated wires <b>2</b> are collectively pushed into the plurality of wire holding portions <b>20</b> by a punch of a press machine, the pairs of wire hold-down pieces <b>22</b> of the first wire holding portions <b>20</b>A receive the pushing forces from the insulated wires <b>2</b>. Accordingly, the pairs of wire holding pieces <b>21</b> respectively connected to the pairs of wire hold-down pieces <b>22</b>, are resiliently expanded and opened, and deformed toward the insides of the wire holding grooves <b>23</b> of the adjacent second wire holding portions <b>20</b>B. In these adjacent second wire holding portions <b>20</b>B, the wire holding pieces <b>21</b> are similarly resiliently expanded and opened at positions shifted, along the axial direction <b>17</b> of the insulated wires <b>2</b>, from the positions where the wire holding pieces <b>21</b> of the first wire holding portions <b>20</b>A are resiliently expanded and opened. That is, the wire holding pieces <b>21</b> of the adjacent second wire holding portions <b>20</b>B are deformed toward the insides of the wire holding grooves <b>23</b> of the adjacent first wire holding portions <b>20</b>A. More specifically, the facing positions of the wire hold-down pieces <b>22</b> of the first wire holding portion <b>20</b>A and the facing positions of the wire hold-down pieces <b>22</b> of the second wire holding portions <b>20</b>B, are out of alignment with each other, back and forth, in the axial direction of the insulated wires <b>2</b>. Therefore, the deformations of the wire holding pieces <b>21</b> occurred at the time when the insulated wires <b>2</b> are pressed, can be absorbed by the mutual wire holding grooves <b>23</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0055">In each of the end wire holding portions <b>20</b>, the outer wire hold-down piece <b>22</b> in the housing widthwise direction <b>16</b> is formed as projecting from the wire holding piece <b>21</b> substantially throughout the length of the wire holding groove <b>23</b>, while the inner wire hold-down piece <b>22</b> is formed only at a limited zone nearer to the housing rear face <b>18</b> (or a limited zone nearer to the contact holding portion <b>15</b>). Thus, the pair of outer and inner wire hold-down pieces <b>22</b> face each other only at this limited zone. The orthogonal retention force for the insulated wire <b>2</b> is produced solely by this zone where the pair of wire hold-down pieces <b>22</b> face each other.</p>
  <p num="p-0056"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a perspective view of an insulation displacement contact <b>12</b>. The insulation displacement contact <b>12</b> is formed in a unitary structure by punching or bending a metallic plate (for example, a plated copper plate). The insulation displacement contact <b>12</b> is provided, at its rear portion corresponding to the housing rear face <b>18</b> side, with an insulation displacement part <b>31</b> to which an insulated wire <b>2</b> is coupled. Also, the insulation displacement contact <b>12</b> is provided, at its front portion, with contact portions <b>32</b> which come in contact with a contact of the board-side connector <b>4</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0057">The insulation displacement part <b>31</b> has first and second insulation displacement portions <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> separated from each other back and force. The first insulation displacement portion <b>33</b> has a pair of insulation displacement blades <b>35</b>, and a connection portion <b>36</b> for holding the pair of insulation displacement blades <b>35</b> such that they face each other. Formed between the insulation displacement blades <b>35</b> is a slot <b>37</b> in which the core wire portion of an insulated wire <b>2</b> is pressed and held. Likewise, the second insulation displacement portion <b>34</b> has a pair of insulation displacement blades <b>39</b> defining a slot <b>41</b>, and the pair of insulation displacement blades <b>39</b> are connected to each other at their base portions by a connection portion <b>40</b>. The connection portions <b>36</b>, <b>40</b> are connected to each other by a bottom plate <b>42</b>. The bottom plate <b>42</b> is provided at each lateral side thereof with a laterally projecting press-fitting projection <b>47</b>. The press-fitting projections <b>47</b> are arranged such that when the insulation displacement contact <b>12</b> is pressed into the corresponding contact holding portion <b>15</b> of the housing <b>11</b>, the press-fitting projections <b>47</b> bite into the inner walls of the contact holding portion <b>15</b> such that the insulation displacement contact <b>12</b> is held by the contact holding portion <b>15</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0058">Contact portions <b>32</b> have (i) a pair of lateral plates <b>43</b> forwardly extending, in parallel to each other, from the outer edges of the insulation displacement blades <b>39</b> of the second insulation displacement portion <b>34</b>, and (ii) a pair of resilient nipping pieces <b>44</b> extending, from the lateral plates <b>43</b>, in the vertical direction at right angles to the axial direction of the insulated wire <b>2</b>. The resilient nipping pieces <b>44</b> extend, from the lateral plates <b>43</b>, in an inclined and tapering manner, and are provided at the tips thereof with guiding inclined portions <b>45</b> which are inclined in expanding and opening directions from the mutual closest portions of the resilient nipping pieces <b>44</b>. The mutual closest portions of the pair of resilient nipping pieces <b>44</b> serve as contact points <b>46</b> arranged to resiliently hold the corresponding contact of the board-side connector <b>4</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the housing <b>11</b> is provided in the top face <b>28</b> thereof with contact receiving grooves <b>48</b> for receiving the contacts of the board-side connector <b>4</b>, the grooves <b>48</b> being formed in the axial direction <b>17</b> of the insulated wires <b>2</b>.

The board-side connector <b>4</b> has a housing <b>50</b> made of a resin molded article, and a plurality of contacts <b>51</b> pressed into and held by the housing <b>50</b>. The housing <b>50</b> has a fitting hole <b>52</b> opened in the front side opposite to the wire-side connector <b>1</b>, and the front portion of the housing <b>11</b> of the wire-side connector <b>1</b> is to be fitted into this fitting hole <b>52</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">The plurality of contacts <b>51</b> are pressed into the housing <b>50</b> from the rear side thereof, and held by the housing <b>50</b> such that they are disposed side by side in the direction parallel to the insertion direction of the wire-side connector <b>1</b>. Each contact <b>51</b> has (i) a contact portion <b>53</b> projecting into the fitting hole <b>52</b>, (ii) a joint portion <b>54</b> which downwardly extends from the rear end of the contact portion <b>53</b> toward the mounting face <b>3</b> <i>a </i>of the printed circuit board <b>3</b> and which is soldered to the surface of the printed circuit board <b>3</b>, and (iii) a press-fitting piece <b>55</b> which projects forwardly from an intermediate portion of the joint portion <b>54</b> and which is pressed into a press-fitting hole <b>57</b> in the housing <b>50</b>. Each contact <b>51</b> is pressed into and fixed to the housing <b>50</b> when the contact portion <b>53</b> is pressed into a terminal insertion hole <b>56</b> and the press-fitting piece <b>55</b> is pressed into the press-fitting hole <b>57</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0062">When the wire-side connector <b>1</b> is inserted into the board-side connector <b>4</b>, the front face <b>13</b> of the housing <b>11</b> of the wire-side connector <b>1</b> comes in contact with the inner bottom face <b>58</b> of the fitting hole <b>52</b> of the board-side connector <b>4</b>, or a step portion <b>27</b> of the housing <b>11</b> comes in contact with an opening edge <b>59</b> of the housing <b>50</b> of the board-side connector <b>4</b>. This regulates the relative positions, in the axial direction <b>17</b> of the insulated wires <b>2</b>, of the wire-side connector <b>1</b> and the board-side connector <b>4</b>. When the front portion of the housing <b>11</b> of the wire-side connector <b>1</b> is fitted into the fitting hole <b>52</b> of the board-side connector <b>4</b>, the contact portions <b>53</b> of the contacts <b>51</b> of the board-side connector <b>4</b> are introduced, as accurately positioned, into the contact receiving grooves <b>48</b> of the wire-side connector <b>1</b>. Thus, the contact portions <b>53</b> are resiliently held, in the contact receiving grooves <b>48</b>, by the pairs of contact points <b>46</b> of the insulation displacement contacts <b>12</b>. This achieves the electric connection between the contacts <b>12</b> and <b>51</b>, causing the insulated wires <b>2</b> to be electrically connected to the printed circuit board <b>3</b>.</p>

More specifically, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref> <i>a</i>) and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref> <i>b</i>) are perspective views of the wire-side connector as respectively seen in directions similar to those in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref> <i>c</i>) is a bottom view of the wire-side connector as seen in a direction similar to that in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The wire-side connector <b>1</b> above-mentioned shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the like, is of the 11-pole type having 11 insulation displacement contacts <b>12</b> and <b>11</b> wire holding portions <b>20</b> such that 11 insulated wires <b>2</b> can be connected in insulation displacement termination. On the other hand, the wire-side connector <b>1</b>A in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9(</figref> <i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), is of the 2-pole type having two insulation displacement contacts <b>12</b> and two wire holding portions <b>20</b> such that two insulated wires <b>2</b> can be connected in insulation displacement termination.</p>
  <p num="p-0064">Out of two wire holding portions <b>20</b>, one is a first wire holding portions <b>20</b>A of which wire hold-down position P<b>1</b> is nearer to the rear face <b>18</b> of the housing <b>11</b>, and the other is a second wire holding portion <b>20</b>B of which wire hold-down position P<b>2</b> is nearer to the insulation displacement contact <b>12</b>. More specifically, a wire holding piece <b>21</b> disposed between and shared with the first wire holding portion <b>20</b>A and the second wire holding portion <b>20</b>B, is provided at one tip edge nearer to the rear face <b>18</b> with a wire hold-down piece <b>22</b> projecting toward the first wire holding portion <b>20</b>A, and is also provided at the other tip edge nearer to the insulation displacement contact <b>12</b> with a wire hold-down piece <b>22</b> projecting toward the second wire holding portion <b>20</b>B. Accordingly, when insulated wires <b>2</b> are simultaneously pushed into the first and second wire holding portions <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B, the wire holding piece <b>21</b> at the boundary therebetween is resiliently deformed, at its portion nearer to the rear face <b>18</b> of the housing <b>11</b>, toward the second wire holding portion <b>20</b>B, and is resiliently deformed, at its front portion nearer to the insulation displacement contact <b>12</b>, toward the first wire holding portion <b>20</b>A.</p>
  <p num="p-0065">Accordingly, two insulated wires <b>2</b> can simultaneously be attached without the housing <b>11</b> remarkably deformed. In other words, the housing <b>11</b> is not required to be remarkably deformed for simultaneously attaching two insulated wires <b>2</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0066"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref> <i>a</i>) and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref> <i>b</i>) are views illustrating the arrangements according to another embodiments of the present invention, showing two examples of the wire hold-down positions in a wire-side connector. In the embodiments above-mentioned, the wire hold-down positions P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b> are alternately disposed as misaligned with each other in the axial direction of the insulated wires <b>2</b> and arranged in zigzags in two rows. In the examples in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref> <i>a</i>) and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref> <i>b</i>), three-type wire hold-down positions P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>, P<b>3</b> are determined in the axial direction of the insulated wire <b>2</b> and arranged in zigzags in three rows.</p>
  <p num="p-0067">More specifically, in the example in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref> <i>a</i>), the wire hold-down positions are successively shifted, along the widthwise direction of the housing <b>11</b>, in a pattern including five positions, i.e., a first wire hold-down position P<b>1</b> nearer to the rear face <b>18</b> of the housing <b>11</b>, a second wire hold-down position P<b>2</b> nearer to the front, a third wire hold-down position P<b>3</b> further nearer to the front, the second wire hold-down position P<b>2</b> and the first wire hold-down position P<b>1</b>. Then, this pattern is repeated. In the example in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref> <i>b</i>), the wire hold-down positions are successively shifted, along the widthwise direction of the housing <b>11</b>, in a pattern including three positions, i.e., the first wire hold-down position P<b>1</b>, the second wire hold-down position P<b>2</b>, and the third wire hold-down position P<b>3</b>. Then, this pattern is cyclically repeated.</p>
  <p num="p-0068">The arrangements shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> may further be developed such that a plurality of wire hold-down positions are arranged in zigzags in four or more rows.</p>
  <p num="p-0069"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a view illustrating the arrangement according to a further embodiment of the present invention, particularly showing the wire hold-down positions in the wire-side connector. In this embodiment, at one side of a first wire holding portion <b>20</b>A having a wire hold-down position at a position P<b>1</b>, there is disposed a first wire holding portions <b>20</b>A having a wire hold-down position at the same position P<b>1</b>. And, at the other side of the first-mentioned first wire holding portion <b>20</b>A, there is disposed a second wire holding portion <b>20</b>B having a wire hold-down position at a position P<b>2</b>. Further, at one side of a second wire holding portion <b>20</b>B having a wire hold-down position at a position P<b>2</b>, there is disposed a second wire holding portion <b>20</b>B having a wire hold-down position at the same position P<b>2</b>. And, at the other side of the first-mentioned second wire holding portion <b>20</b>B, there is disposed a first wire holding portion <b>20</b>A having a wire hold-down position at a position P<b>1</b>. That is, two first wire holding portions <b>20</b>A and two second wire holding portions <b>20</b>B are alternately disposed.</p>
  <p num="p-0070">In the arrangement above-mentioned, too, one of each pair of wire holding pieces <b>21</b> forming a wire holding portion <b>20</b>, can resiliently be deformed in the wire holding grooves <b>23</b> of adjacent wire holding portions <b>20</b>. Accordingly, likewise in the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the like, a plurality of insulated wires can simultaneously be mounted without the housing <b>11</b> remarkably deformed.</p>
  <p num="p-0071">In the embodiments shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, it is common in the wire-side connectors <b>1</b> having three or more poles that, as to three arbitrary adjacent wire holding portions, the wire hold-down positions of at least a pair of wire holding portions are misaligned with each other back and forth along the axial direction <b>17</b> of the insulated wires <b>2</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0072">In the foregoing, various embodiments of the present invention have been discussed, but the present invention may be embodied in other manner. For example, in the embodiments above-mentioned, the description has been made of the wire-side connectors of the 11-pole and 2-pole types. However, no particular restrictions are imposed on the number of poles in the wire-side connector. For example, a similar arrangement may be adopted for a wire-side connector of the 20-pole type.</p>
  <p num="p-0073">In the embodiments above-mentioned, the description has been made of a wire-side connector having insulation displacement contacts, but the present invention may also be applied to a connector having contacts of other type such as crimping-type contacts and the like.</p>
  <p num="p-0074">In the embodiments above-mentioned, the description has been made of the arrangement in which a plurality of insulation displacement contacts <b>12</b> are fixed to the housing <b>11</b> as aligned in a straight line along the widthwise direction <b>16</b> of the housing <b>11</b>. However, likewise the wire holding portions <b>20</b>, the insulation displacement contacts <b>12</b> may also be disposed in zigzags or other form. More specifically, the positions of the insulation displacement contacts <b>12</b> may be determined such that, in the wire holding portions, the distances between the wire hold-down positions and the insulation displacement parts <b>31</b> of the insulation displacement contacts <b>12</b>, are substantially uniform. According to the arrangement above-mentioned, the distances between the wire hold-down positions and the insulated wires holding positions by the insulation displacement contacts <b>12</b>, are uniform. This enables a plurality of insulated wires <b>2</b> to be held by the housing <b>11</b> substantially under the same conditions.</p>
  <p num="p-0075">Embodiments of the present invention have been discussed in detail, but these embodiments are mere specific examples for clarifying the technical contents of the present invention. Therefore, the present invention should not be construed as limited to these specific examples. The spirit and scope of the present invention are limited only by the appended claims.</p>
