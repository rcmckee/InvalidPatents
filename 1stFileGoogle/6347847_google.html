    <p>This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/433,352, filed Nov. 4, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,176,559, which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/017,197, filed Feb. 2, 1998, now abandoned.</p>
    <heading>FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention relates to an apparatus for transporting articles, such as hand tools and similar items, between desired locations.</p>
    <p>When working in fields such as carpentry and other similar trades, it is often necessary to work in a number of different locations on one job site. For example, during a given work day, a carpenter may be required to undertake activities in a number of different rooms in a house he or she is working on. Most tradesmen hand carry their tools in toolboxes and other similar containers from location to location. Many times, the activities undertaken require more tools than can be easily carried from one location to another in one trip.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>It is therefore an object of the invention to provide an improved device for transporting articles between locations. To achieve this object, the present invention provides an apparatus for transporting articles. The apparatus comprises a base container having an interior space in which articles to be transported can be stored; one or more rotatable ground engaging wheels mounted for rotation about an axis to provide rolling support for the apparatus; and a removable container having an interior space in which articles to be transported can be stored. The removable container has a carrying handle that is manually graspable to enable carriage of the removable container. The removable container is removably mounted the base container and the removable container is removable for carriage by the carrying handle separately from the base container. A latch assembly secures the removable container above the base container. The latch assembly is releasable to enable removal of the removable container by the carrying handle for carriage separately from the base container. A manually engageable pulling handle has a hand grip portion. The pulling handle and the one or more ground engaging wheels are arranged on one side of the apparatus to enable a user to manually grasp the hand grip portion and pull the pulling handle generally rearwardly so as to tilt the apparatus rearwardly from (a) a substantially upright position wherein the apparatus is supported in a freestanding manner to (b) a tilted rolling movement position wherein the apparatus is rollingly supported by the ground engaging wheels, thereby enabling the user to roll the apparatus to a desired location by pushing or pulling the pulling handle in a desired direction.</p>
    <p>The feature of providing a removable container is particularly advantageous because it allows the user to carry the removable container from to a desired location that would be otherwise inaccessible for the entire apparatus, such as a small crawl space. Otherwise, the tools would have to removed from the apparatus and carried by hand. This aspect is particularly useful when the removable container has a handle, such as a toolbox. The removable container, whether it be a set of sliding drawers, a toolbox, a top loading bin, or some other type of container, can be removed and the load to be carried can be disposed on the base container, thus allowing the apparatus to act as a regular load carrying device.</p>
    <p>Another aspect of the invention provides an apparatus for transporting articles. The apparatus comprises a base container having an interior space in which articles to be transported can be stored; one or more ground engaging wheels mounted for rotation about an axis to enable the apparatus to be rollingly transported; and one or more removable containers removably mounted in a stacked relation directly atop the base container. The one or more removable containers comprising a toolbox having (i) a container portion with an interior space in which articles to be transported can be stored, the container portion having a generally upwardly facing opening, (ii) a pivoting lid pivotally mounted to the container portion, the lid being pivotable between an open position permitting access into container portion through the generally upwardly facing opening thereof and a closed position preventing access into container portion through the generally upwardly facing opening thereof, and (iii) a manually graspable carrying handle enabling carriage of the toolbox. The toolbox is removable for carriage by the carrying handle separately from the base container. The apparatus also comprises a manually engageable pulling handle having a hand grip portion. The pulling handle and the one or more ground engaging wheels are arranged on one side of the apparatus to enable a user to manually grasp the hand grip portion and pull the pulling handle generally rearwardly so as to tilt the apparatus rearwardly from (a) a substantially upright position wherein the apparatus is supported in a freestanding manner to (b) a tilted rolling movement position wherein the apparatus is rollingly supported by the ground engaging wheels, thereby enabling the user to roll the apparatus to a desired location by pushing or pulling the pulling handle in a desired direction.</p>
    <p>Yet another aspect of the present invention provides an apparatus for transporting articles. The apparatus of this aspect of the invention comprises a base container having an interior space with an upwardly facing opening in which articles to be transported can be stored; one or more ground engaging wheels mounted to the base container for rotation about an axis to enable the apparatus to be rollingly transported; and a toolbox having (i) a container portion with an interior space in which articles to be transported can be stored, the container portion having a generally upwardly facing opening, (ii) a pivoting lid pivotally mounted to an upper rearward portion of the container portion, the lid being pivotable between an open position permitting access into container portion through the generally upwardly facing opening thereof and a closed position preventing access into container portion through the generally upwardly facing opening thereof, (iii) latches on a front side of the toolbox, the latches releasably latching the lid in the closed position thereof and (iv) a carrying handle mounted to the lid and manually graspable to enable carriage of the toolbox. The toolbox is removably mounted above the upwardly facing opening of the base container and is removable for carriage by the carrying handle separately from the base container. A latch assembly comprises a pair of latches an opposing lateral sides of the apparatus. The latches of the latch assembly secure the toolbox above the base container and are releasable to enable removal of the toolbox by the carrying handle for carriage separately from the base container. A manually engageable pulling handle has a hand grip portion. The pulling handle is movable between a storage position and a deployed position. The pulling handle extends upwardly from one side of the apparatus when in the deployed position and the one or more ground engaging wheels are arranged on the same the one side of the apparatus to enable a user to manually grasp the hand grip portion and pull the pulling handle in the deployed position thereof generally rearwardly so as to tilt the apparatus rearwardly from (a) a substantially upright position wherein the apparatus is supported in a freestanding manner to (b) a tilted rolling movement position wherein the apparatus is rollingly supported by the ground engaging wheels, thereby enabling the user to roll the apparatus to a desired location by pushing or pulling the pulling handle in a desired direction.</p>

    <p>Rolling containers assembly <b>50</b> further includes at least one additional cabinet <b>58</b> in the form of a removable container. Additional cabinet <b>58</b> is removably connectable on top of base cabinet <b>52</b>. Specifically, the upper surface of the base cabinet <b>52</b> provides container supporting structure and the additional cabinet <b>58</b> is removably mounted atop this structure.</p>
    <p>As further detailed hereinbelow, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention handle <b>56</b> is extendible/retractable.</p>
    <p>As further detailed hereinbelow, according to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, additional cabinet(s) <b>58</b> include, for example, a drawers assembly <b>60</b> and/or a toolcase <b>62</b>.</p>
    <p>As further detailed hereinbelow, according to another preferred embodiment of the present invention base cabinet <b>52</b> is supplemented with a coil storage device in the form of a reel <b>64</b>.</p>
    <p>As best seen in FIG. 12 additional containers <b>58</b> are preferably designed modular, such that any combination thereof is deployable over base cabinet <b>52</b> or as a standalone configuration. Thus, for example, a plurality of drawer assemblies <b>62</b> may be snapped together as an independent drawers tower system with keyholes <b>63</b> formed in the rear for wall mounting.</p>
    <p>Connecting any of additional cabinet(s) <b>58</b> to base cabinet <b>52</b> preferably involves snapping. To this end, base cabinet <b>52</b> and the additional cabinet(s) <b>58</b> are designed snappable to one another, and, to this end, are supplemented with a latch assembly including a pair of latches or snapping mechanisms <b>66</b>, which preferably also serve as side claw latches for providing extra stability. This latch assembly secures the removable container (whether it be the toolbox, the storage drawer assembly, or both secured together) above the base container. The latch assembly is releasable to enable removal of the removable container by the carrying handle <b>92</b> for carriage separately from the base container. Specifically, the latches <b>66</b> move between latched positions wherein the latches <b>66</b> engage the removable container to secure it above the base container and unlatched positions out of engagement with the removable container to release the removable container.</p>
    <p>According to a preferred embodiment of the invention toolcase <b>62</b> includes a case <b>68</b> and an openable cover <b>70</b>. Cover <b>70</b> is preferably fabricated featuring an external groove <b>72</b>. Groove <b>72</b> is usable in supporting rectangular <b>74</b> and/or round <b>76</b> objects (FIGS. 15<i>a-b</i>). Groove <b>72</b> is preferably asymmetrical in cross section. Preferably, groove <b>72</b> is formed as a recess residing between a first wall <b>78</b> and a second wall <b>80</b> of cover <b>70</b>. Walls <b>78</b> and <b>80</b> are deployed in a V shape.</p>
    <p>As best seen in FIGS. 15<i>a-b</i>, first wall <b>78</b> is deployed 63±15 degrees with respect to cover <b>70</b>, second wall <b>80</b> is deployed 27±15 degrees with respect to cover <b>70</b>, whereas first <b>78</b> and second <b>80</b> walls are deployed 90 degrees with respect to one another.</p>
    <p>Groove <b>72</b> is designed to facilitate cutting desired object. Grooves are known in the art for some time and serve to facilitate cutting round objects. However, all prior art grooves, as shown in FIGS. 14<i>a </i>and <b>14</b> <i>b</i>, traditionally have symmetric cross sections.</p>
    <p>As specifically shown in FIGS. 15<i>a-b</i>, groove <b>72</b>, on the other hand, is selected symmetrical. Groove's <b>72</b> architecture is specifically designed to allow cutting both rectangular wood and round pipe elements. To this end, the asymmetry of about 63/27 degrees is preferably selected. This asymmetry dictates that groove's <b>72</b> shortest side is more than half shorter than groove's <b>72</b> longest side, allowing a 2″×4″ wood size to be cut in a stable manner without excess slippage.</p>
    <p>The 63/27 degrees feature has been experimentally shown to be the most useful angle for this sort of work, however, it is feasible that for other applications other asymmetric dimensions would prove more adapted. Therefore, according to the present invention groove <b>72</b> may have any asymmetrical or symmetrical design.</p>
    <p>As best seen in FIG. 16, groove <b>72</b> is preferably formed with grip ribs <b>82</b> on at least a section thereof. Grip ribs <b>82</b> are preferably arranged on the outer edges of groove <b>72</b>. Grip ribs <b>82</b> are designed to provide friction and thereby to minimize the vibration of the material being cut, which tends to vibrate in concert with the saw.</p>
    <p>As best seen in FIGS. 16 and 17<i>a-b</i>, cover <b>70</b> is preferably formed with underlying strengthening ribs <b>84</b>. Underlying strengthening ribs <b>84</b> are preferably deployed crosswise with respect to one another and obliquely with respect to an edge <b>86</b> of cover <b>70</b>, such that triangular shapes <b>88</b> are formed along edge <b>86</b>.</p>
    <p>Preferably underlying strengthening ribs are deployed 90 degrees crosswise with respect to one another and 45 degrees with respect to edge <b>86</b> of cover <b>70</b>.</p>
    <p>As best seen in FIG. 16, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention cover <b>70</b> is formed with external protrusions <b>90</b>. Protrusions <b>90</b> are deployed above, parallel to, underlying strengthening ribs <b>84</b> and serve for at least partially disguising sink marks associated with ribs <b>84</b>. External protrusions <b>84</b> are preferably acquired a diamond shape (♦).</p>
    <p>It has been recent practice to heavily rib the underside of plastic toolcase covers to withstand the weight of the average person, who typically will use them as de facto step tools. The “sink marks” that show on the top surface of such covers is noticeable and disguised typically with some sort of decoration running in the same direction of the ribbing.</p>
    <p>FIG. 16 shows a section of ribs <b>84</b> arrangement on the top left end of cover <b>70</b>. This ribbing preferably runs the entire underside of cover <b>70</b>. As already mentioned hereinabove ribbing <b>84</b> is preferably deployed at 45 degrees orientation with respect to the edge of the cover. Thereby ribs <b>84</b> terminate in triangles <b>88</b> (FIG. 17<i>b</i>). The triangular termination around the relatively more sensitive perimeter of the cover is measurably stronger than traditional rectangular ribbing (FIG. 17<i>a</i>).</p>
    <p>The preferred embodiment is aesthetically enabled by the chosen diamond pattern that overlays the ribs on the top side of the case (FIG. <b>16</b>). Although such diamond patterns are a common anti-slippage icon in the hardware steel industry, this is the first time to have them introduced into the plastic industry to serve as anti-slippage elements and at the same time for disguising rib sinkage marks.</p>
    <p>According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention cover <b>70</b> includes a carrying handle <b>92</b>. Carrying handle <b>92</b> is preferably foldable into a recession <b>94</b> formed in cover <b>70</b> which is sized and dimensioned for receiving handle <b>92</b> when folded.</p>
    <p>According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention toolcase <b>62</b> includes at least one releasable latch <b>96</b> (two are shown) for releasably securing/locking cover <b>70</b> to case <b>68</b> when closed. Cover <b>70</b> is hinged connected to case <b>68</b> via a hinge <b>98</b>. Preferably, as best seen in FIG. 16, toolcase <b>62</b> includes a front <b>100</b>, sides <b>102</b> and back <b>104</b>, wherein sides <b>102</b> taper toward back <b>104</b>. Front <b>100</b> is preferably curved.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIGS. 18<i>a-b</i>, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention a Logo plate <b>106</b> is added between latches <b>96</b>. Plate <b>106</b> is preferably a separate molded panel which is molded at 90 degrees to the rest of the case, however it appears to be an integral part of the case when assembled, rather than a separate item.</p>
    <p>According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, and as specifically shown in FIGS. 19-22, toolcase <b>62</b> preferably includes a removable tray <b>108</b>, deployable within case <b>68</b>. Tray <b>108</b> preferably includes a tray-handle <b>110</b>. Preferably, as best seen in FIG. 19<i>b</i>, tray-handle <b>108</b> nests between side arms <b>110</b> of carrying handle <b>92</b> of cover <b>70</b>.</p>
    <p>Thus, in sharp contrast with the conventional configuration shown in FIG. 19<i>a</i>, wherein the tray handle <b>110</b>′ resides below the cover handle, thereby effectively lowering the tray in the case, according to the present invention, the tray handle nests between the vertical arms of the cover handle, rendering the tray about 20% higher, gaining much requested additional room in the main case.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, with the handle residing directly underneath the cover, it now acts as a load bearing member when a user stands on the case, transmitting a partial load through the tray onto the perimeter of the base. One additional benefit is that ribs which are preferably deployed on the underside of the tray can be lighter and use less material.</p>
    <p>A common problem with plastic tray handle designs is how to produce a solid feeling handle from both sides. Typically the handle is open from the top (FIG. 21<i>a</i>), which functions well but is not attractive, or the handle is open from the bottom (FIG. 21<i>b</i>) which looks good but can be painful to the hand.</p>
    <p>According to the present invention, as specifically shown in FIGS. 21<i>c </i>and <b>22</b> <i>a</i>, an additional piece <b>112</b> is used to fill the area of a handle open from the top by snapping piece <b>112</b> into the top opening. Thereby, both functionality and aesthetic are achieved. This solution offers both solid feeling and looks to the handle and a good surface area for hand comfort.</p>
    <p>According to a preferred embodiment of the invention drawers assembly <b>60</b> includes a casing <b>114</b> and at least one translating drawer <b>116</b> (two are shown) translatably engaged by casing <b>114</b>. Preferably, as shown in FIG. 23, drawer(s) <b>116</b>, aided by reels <b>118</b>, translate over rails <b>120</b> which are connected to, or integrally formed with, casing <b>114</b>.</p>
    <p>According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, all of drawers <b>116</b> are securable close via a single securing member <b>121</b> (best seen in FIG. <b>7</b>), which engages securing elements <b>122</b> attached to a the aft of drawers <b>116</b> and protrudes through dedicated holes <b>124</b> formed in casing <b>114</b> (FIG. <b>6</b>).</p>
    <p>Preferably, single securing member <b>121</b> is attached to or forms a part of handle <b>56</b>, such that when handle <b>56</b> is retracted securing member <b>121</b> simultaneously secures all of drawers <b>116</b> closed.</p>
    <p>It is common for toolbox drawers to have locks on their front side. Due to handle <b>56</b> of assembly <b>50</b> it is possible to have the drawers secured/locked from behind.</p>
    <p>In any case, drawers <b>116</b> are preferably supplemented with opening handles <b>123</b>. Handles <b>123</b> are preferably also designed to secure/lock drawers <b>116</b> to casing <b>114</b> when closed.</p>
    <p>A common problem associated with cabinets and drawers of any construction is that the drawers have to remain to a significant percentage within the casing of the product even in the extended position to avoid falling out. The drawers assembly described herein is notable for having cabinet rollers appended beyond the extremity of the product. This feature allows the drawers to be pulled out further than would otherwise be possible.</p>
    <p>According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention base cabinet <b>52</b> of rolling containers assembly <b>50</b> includes a casing or frame <b>126</b> to which handle <b>56</b> and wheels <b>54</b> are engaged. Base cabinet <b>52</b> further includes a flipping bin <b>128</b>. Casing or frame <b>126</b> is formed with a housing <b>127</b> for holding handle <b>56</b> when extended and for accepting handle <b>56</b> when retracted. Thus, handle <b>56</b> is retractable into, and extendible from, housing <b>127</b>.</p>
    <p>Casing or frame <b>126</b> is formed having a base element <b>129</b>. Base <b>129</b> is designed to be in contact with the floor when assembly <b>50</b> is positioned in its upright position. Wheels <b>54</b> are designed to have substantially no or minimal contact with the floor when in the upright position. Wheels <b>54</b> take firm contact with the floor only when assembly <b>50</b> is in its locomoting position, as shown, for example, in FIG. <b>24</b>.</p>
    <p>Casing <b>126</b> and casing <b>114</b> may each be considered to be a frame or frame portion, and together may be considered to be a frame assembly irrespective of whether the casing portions or frame portions <b>114</b>, <b>126</b> can be separated from one another. In the preferred embodiment, as shown, the frame assembly can be separated into portions <b>114</b>, <b>126</b>.</p>
    <p>Flipping bin <b>128</b> is rotatable with respect to casing <b>126</b> and has an upper opening <b>130</b>. Casing <b>126</b> is preferably formed with an upper rim <b>132</b>. Rim <b>132</b> is supplemented with anchor holes <b>134</b> which serve for attaching strings <b>136</b> (shown in FIG. 24) for effecting carriage of desired items on top of base cabinet <b>52</b> when additional cabinet(s) <b>58</b> are removed.</p>
    <p>Handle <b>52</b> is preferably formed with additional holes <b>138</b> which further serve for attaching strings <b>136</b> for effecting the carriage of bigger items on top of base cabinet <b>52</b>.</p>
    <p>Thus, the anchor holes situated fore and aft at the top of the base cabinet allow the base cabinet and the handle to be used as a separate dolly. This is particularly useful when additional materials have to be carried to the working site.</p>
    <p>According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention reel <b>64</b> is a revolving electrical reel rotatably attached to casing <b>126</b>, within a dedicated recession <b>140</b> formed therein, such that reel <b>64</b> would not protrude from the general outline of base cabinet <b>52</b>.</p>
    <p>According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention reel <b>64</b> is removable (disconnectable/detachable) from casing <b>126</b>, and may function as a standalone reel.</p>
    <p>As specifically shown in FIG. 25, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention casing <b>126</b> is supplemented with at least two elastic bands <b>142</b>, designed for engaging desired long items <b>144</b> (e.g., a saw) along a side <b>146</b> thereof.</p>
    <p>According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention flipping bin <b>128</b> is rotatably connected to casing <b>126</b> via a hinge, marked by a broken line <b>146</b> in FIG. 7, located such that bin <b>128</b> opens when reaches beyond a center of gravity point and closes when is before the center of gravity point, such that bin <b>128</b> fully opens or closes when used. This feature of bin <b>128</b> is effective also when load is loaded therein. Therefore, when used, bin <b>128</b> remains open irrespective of its content load. Conversely bin <b>128</b> remains closed even when not locked in the transportable situation of assembly <b>50</b>, shown, for example in FIG. <b>24</b>.</p>
    <p>However, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention bin <b>128</b> is equipped with a front lock <b>148</b>, which locks bin <b>128</b> to casing <b>126</b>.</p>
    <p>Handle <b>56</b> is deployed on the back side of base cabinet <b>52</b> and is selected conventional in its design, as seen, for example, in rolling luggage pieces, e.g., by SAMSONITE. However, such handles have so far not been employed as described herein.</p>
    <p>According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, handle <b>56</b> is completely detachable from assembly <b>50</b> to allow for separation of the components thereof for storage or transportation in confined spaces i.e., closets or car trunks.</p>
    <p>Handle <b>56</b> is attached/detached from base cabinet <b>52</b> via a flexing member <b>150</b>. Flexing members are well known in the art of plastics and require no further description herein.</p>
    <p>Reel <b>64</b> is functionally notable for the following features. First, as already mentioned hereinabove, it is removable from casing <b>126</b> and may serve as a separate standalone reel, functioning independently of assembly <b>50</b>. Reel <b>64</b> is locked onto its location (recession <b>140</b>) on casing <b>126</b> by a quarter turn locking mechanism as further detailed hereinbelow.</p>
    <p>Current reels for electric cables or other purposes (e.g., garden/pool hoses) share a common construction i.e., a reel comprised of a hollow core and round flanges rotating about an axle. Such reels are typically appended with legs arrangement or a handle to improve functionality.</p>
    <p>Reel <b>64</b> according to the present invention appears traditional by intent, but its functionality is quite different form the current art.</p>
    <p>As best seen in FIGS. 10 and 11, reel <b>64</b> includes a hub or front round flange <b>152</b> which is affixed to a core <b>154</b> which revolves. Reel <b>64</b> further includes a back flange <b>156</b> which is affixed to yet another core <b>158</b> which does not revolve. Core <b>158</b> rotatably fits inside core <b>154</b>. Core <b>158</b> therefore acts as an axle for core <b>154</b> and flange <b>152</b> to revolve on. Functionality of such an arrangement would be significantly impaired without a revolving back flange to carry the weight of the cord and prevent friction. To this end, front flange <b>152</b> and core <b>154</b> carry several (e.g., three or more) paddles <b>160</b> deployed at the rear end of core <b>154</b>.</p>
    <p>The exterior surface of core <b>54</b> defines a coil supporting surface and the inner surfaces of the flanges <b>152</b>, <b>156</b> active coil retaining surfaces. As can be appreciated, when a flexible member, such as an extension cord, is wound about the hub <b>154</b>, the flanges (i.e., the coil retaining surfaces) restrain the coiled member against lateral movement with respect to the hub <b>154</b>.</p>
    <p>When assembled paddles <b>160</b> lay against static back flange <b>156</b>, rotating thereon. Paddles <b>160</b> effectively carry the weight of the cord preventing spread and allowing the otherwise revolving rear flange to act as a static mounting point.</p>
    <p>As best seen in FIGS. 26<i>a-b </i>two protrusions <b>164</b> formed in recession <b>140</b> of casing <b>126</b> are camming into corresponding holes <b>162</b> formed in backplate <b>156</b>, serving to lock/unlock plate <b>156</b> to assembly <b>50</b> by a quarter of a turn.</p>
    <p>Back plate <b>156</b> is supplemented with a lever <b>166</b>. Lever <b>166</b> is positioned such that when plate <b>156</b> is in its locked position, lever is pulled over a dedicated protrusion <b>167</b> (best seen in FIG. <b>2</b>), formed in casing <b>126</b>, thereby securing reel <b>64</b> in its locked position, such that inadvertent disconnection of reel <b>64</b> from base cabinet <b>52</b> becomes practically impossible.</p>
    <p>Reel <b>64</b> is preferably further supplemented with a revolving handle <b>170</b> asymmetrically attached to front plate <b>152</b> for releasing a cord engaged thereon.</p>
    <p>It can be appreciated from the figures that a guiding aperture <b>171</b> is provided on the base cabinet <b>52</b> adjacent the reel <b>64</b>. As can be readily understood from the figures, this aperture <b>171</b> is provided so that a flexible elongated extension cord member wound on the reel <b>64</b> can be fed through the aperture <b>171</b> as the member pays out from the reel <b>64</b>.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 27-31 show another embodiment of the rolling containers assembly according to the present invention, which is referred to hereinbelow as assembly <b>200</b>.</p>
    <p>Like assembly <b>50</b>, assembly <b>200</b> includes a base cabinet <b>202</b> which is supplemented with wheels <b>204</b> for locomoting rolling containers assembly <b>200</b>.</p>
    <p>Assembly <b>200</b> further includes at least one additional cabinet or removable container (these terms being used interchangeably) <b>206</b> which is removably connectable (by snapping) on top <b>208</b> of base cabinet <b>202</b>.</p>
    <p>Additional cabinet <b>206</b> includes a pulling handle <b>210</b> for effecting locomotion. The pulling handle <b>210</b> has a hand grip portion <b>211</b>.</p>
    <p>According to a preferred embodiment, additional cabinet <b>206</b> is a clamshell style case or toolbox <b>212</b> and/or a carousel organizer <b>214</b>. FIG. 32 illustrates the removable container <b>206</b> as only the clamshell tool case <b>212</b>.</p>
    <p>In FIGS. 27, <b>28</b>, <b>29</b> and <b>31</b>, the at least one cabinet <b>206</b> includes both the clamshell style case or toolbox <b>212</b> and the carousel organizer <b>214</b>, with the at least one cabinet <b>206</b> being secured to the base cabinet <b>202</b> by a latch or latch assembly <b>230</b> as shown. The tool case <b>212</b> is secured to the organizer <b>214</b> in any manner, for example, by a frictional fit as shown.</p>
    <p>As further shown in the drawings, the toolbox or case <b>212</b> includes a container portion <b>232</b> that has an upwardly facing opening (see FIG. 31) and defines an interior space in which articles can be stored and transported. Also shown in FIGS. 27, <b>28</b>, <b>29</b>, <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> is a lid portion <b>234</b> pivotally connected to container portion <b>232</b>, and which is arranged to cover the upwardly facing opening of container portion <b>232</b>. The lid portion <b>234</b> can be latched to container portion <b>232</b> by a pair of latches <b>236</b>. A carrying handle <b>238</b> is pivotally attached to the lid portion <b>234</b> in conventional fashion and is manually graspable to enable carriage of the at least one removable container <b>206</b> separately from the base container <b>202</b>.</p>
    <p>As seen best in FIG. 31, the toolbox <b>212</b> contains a conventional tool tray <b>238</b> as knwon in the art. Similarly, another tool tray <b>238</b> may be provided to sit within the base cabinet <b>202</b> as shown. As also shown, the base cabinet <b>202</b> has four substantially vertical walls <b>242</b> defining an upwardly facing opening to the base cabinet <b>202</b>. The at least one additional cabinet <b>206</b> is secured above the opening of the base cabinet <b>202</b> as shown in the Figures.</p>
    <p>It can be appreciated that the container portion <b>232</b> has its upwardly facing opening disposed in such upwardly facing orientation when the device <b>200</b> is in its substantially upright position, as illustrated in FIGS. 27-29, <b>31</b> and <b>32</b>, thus permitting tools to be placed downwardly into such upwardly facing opening when the lid <b>234</b> is opened. In the closed position, the major portion of lid <b>234</b> is substantially horizontally disposed in covering relation to the opening of container portion <b>232</b>.</p>
    <p>According to a preferred embodiment base cabinet <b>202</b> includes accessories <b>218</b> anchor points <b>220</b>. Accessories <b>218</b> may be of any type. Accessories <b>218</b> anchor points <b>220</b> serve as a custom attachment feature present on base cabinet <b>202</b> which allows various molded components with different functionality to be attached thereon to tune the product for specific purposes (e.g., fishing, gardening, etc.). In the embodiments shown, the accessory <b>218</b> has a relatively narrow portion adjacent to the base container and a relatively wider portion extending vertically in spaced relation from the base container. This can be used, for example, to wrap an extension cord therearound. Other features of assembly <b>200</b> are similar to those described hereinabove with respect to assembly <b>50</b>.</p>
    <p>According to a preferred embodiment of the invention all of the components of the rolling containers assembly are injected plastic components.</p>
    <p>Thus, the present invention relates to improvements to toolboxes for industrial and home/hobby applications.</p>
    <p>The rolling containers assembly according to the present invention is the first modular rolling workshop having a retractable/extendible handle system.</p>
    <p>Breaking the assembly into three vertically modular components provides several functional advantages.</p>
    <p>First, the total weight is dividable for purposes of lifting the assembly over steps, into car trunks, etc.</p>
    <p>Second, the vertical configuration is economically practical when accessing the assembly's interior.</p>
    <p>Third, when disassembled the assembly according to the present invention is storable is small confinements, such as the trunk of an average sedan.</p>
    <p>Finally, the modular vertical nature of the rolling containers assembly according to the present invention allows a user to take “as much as he needs”.</p>
    <p>Thus, for small jobs the toolcase or the toolcase and the drawers assembly can be deployed with the traditional side claw latches.</p>
    <p>In any case, when the toolcase and drawers assembly are removed the remaining base cabinet and back handle transform into a dolly for additional load carrying.</p>
    <p>Although the invention has been described in conjunction with specific embodiments thereof, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications and variations that fall within the spirit and broad scope of the appended claims.</p>
