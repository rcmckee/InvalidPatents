<heading>PRIORITY CLAIM</heading> <p num="p-0002">This is a divisional application of, and claims priority to, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/155,385, filed May 24, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,033,539 the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.</p>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">The present invention generally relates to dialysis systems. More specifically, the present invention relates to automated peritoneal dialysis systems. The present invention also relates to methods of performing automated peritoneal dialysis and devices for performing same.</p>
  <p num="p-0004">Due to disease, insult or other causes, a person's renal system can fail. In renal failure of any cause, there are several physiological derangements. The balance of water, minerals and the excretion of daily metabolic load is no longer possible in renal failure. During renal failure, toxic end products of nitrogen metabolism (urea, creatinine, uric acid, and others) can accumulate in blood and tissues.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">Kidney failure and reduced kidney function have been treated with dialysis. Dialysis removes waste, toxins and excess water from the body that would otherwise have been removed by normal functioning kidneys. Dialysis treatment for replacement of kidney functions is critical to many people because the treatment is life saving. One who has failed kidneys could not continue to live without replacing at least the filtration functions of the kidneys.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are two types of dialysis therapies commonly used to treat loss of kidney function. Hemodialysis treatment utilizes the patient's blood to remove waste, toxins and excess water from the patient. The patient is connected to a hemodialysis machine and the patient's blood is pumped through the machine. Catheters are inserted into the patient's veins and arteries to connect the blood flow to and from the hemodialysis machine. As blood passes through a dialyzer in the hemodialysis machine, the dialyzer removes the waste, toxins and excess water from the patient's blood and returns the blood back to the patient. A large amount of dialysate, for example about 120 liters, is used to dialyze the blood during a single hemodialysis therapy. The spent dialysate is then discarded. Hemodialysis treatment lasts several hours and is generally performed in a treatment center about three or four times per week.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">Peritoneal dialysis utilizes a dialysis solution or “dialysate”, which is infused into a patient's peritoneal cavity through a catheter implanted in the cavity. The dialysate contacts the patient's peritoneal membrane in the peritoneal cavity. Waste, toxins and excess water pass from the patient's bloodstream through the peritoneal membrane and into the dialysate. The transfer of waste, toxins, and water from the bloodstream into the dialysate occurs due to diffusion and osmosis, i.e., an osmotic gradient occurs across the membrane. The spent dialysate drains from the patient's peritoneal cavity and removes the waste, toxins and excess water from the patient. This cycle is repeated.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">There are various types of peritoneal dialysis therapies, including continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (“CAPD”), automated peritoneal dialysis and continuous flow peritoneal dialysis. CAPD is a manual dialysis treatment, in which the patient connects an implanted catheter to a drain and allows a spent dialysate fluid to drain from the peritoneal cavity. The patient then connects the catheter to a bag of fresh dialysate and manually infuses fresh dialysate through the catheter and into the patient's peritoneal cavity. The patient disconnects the catheter from the fresh dialysate bag and allows the dialysate to dwell within the cavity to transfer waste, toxins and excess water from the patient's bloodstream to the dialysate solution. After a dwell period, the patient repeats the manual dialysis procedure.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">In CAPD the patient performs several drain, fill, and dwell cycles during the day, for example, about four times per day. Each treatment cycle typically takes about an hour. Manual peritoneal dialysis performed by the patient requires a significant amount of time and effort from the patient. This inconvenient procedure leaves ample room for improvement and therapy enhancements to improve patient quality of life.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">Automated peritoneal dialysis (“APD”) is similar to CAPD in that the dialysis treatment includes a drain, fill, and dwell cycle. APD machines, however, automatically perform three to four cycles of peritoneal dialysis treatment, typically overnight while the patient sleeps. The APD machines fluidly connect to an implanted catheter. The APD machines also fluidly connect to a source or bag of fresh dialysate and to a fluid drain.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">The APD machines pump fresh dialysate from the dialysate source, through the catheter, into the patient's peritoneal cavity and allow the dialysate to dwell within the cavity so that the transfer of waste, toxins and excess water from the patient's bloodstream to the dialysate solution can take place. The APD machines then pump spent dialysate from the peritoneal cavity, though the catheter, to the drain. APD machines are typically computer controlled so that the dialysis treatment occurs automatically when the patient is connected to the dialysis machine, for example, when the patient sleeps. That is, the APD systems automatically and sequentially pump fluid into the peritoneal cavity, allow for a dwell, pump fluid out of the peritoneal cavity and repeat the procedure.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">As with the manual process, several drain, fill, and dwell cycles will occur during APD. A “last fill” is typically used at the end of APD, which remains in the peritoneal cavity of the patient when the patient disconnects from the dialysis machine for the day. APD frees the patient from having to manually performing the drain, dwell, and fill steps.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">However, continuing needs exist to provide improved APD systems. For example, needs exist to provide simplified APD systems that are easier for patients to use and operate. Further, needs exist to provide lower cost APD systems and APD systems which are less costly to operate. Particularly, needs exist to clinically, economically and ergonomically improve known APD systems.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">APD systems need to be improved for home use. One common problem with current home systems is that they are susceptible to electrical shock due to “leakage current”. Current that flows from or between conductors insulated from one another and from earth is called “leakage current”. If any conductor is raised to a potential above earth potential, then some current is bound to flow from that conductor to earth. This is true even of conductors that are well insulated from earth, since there is no such thing as perfect insulation or infinite resistance. The amount of current that flows depends on: (i) the potential, (ii) the capacitate reactance between the conductor and earth and (iii) the resistance between the conductor and earth.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">For medical equipment, several different leakage currents are defined according to the paths that the leakage currents take. An “earth leakage current” is the current which normally flows in the earth conductor of a protectively earthed piece of equipment. In medical equipment, impedance to earth from an enclosure is normally much lower through a protective earth conductor than it is through the patient. However, if the protective earth conductor becomes open circuited, the patient could be at risk of electrical shock.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">“Patient leakage current” is the leakage current that flows through a patient connected to an applied part or parts. It can either flow from the applied parts via the patient to earth or from an external source of high potential via the patient and the applied parts to earth. Other types of leakage currents include “enclosure leakage current”, and “patient auxiliary current”.</p>
  <p num="p-0017">Leakage currents are normally small, however, the amount of current required to produce adverse physiological effects in patients is also small. Accordingly, leakage currents must be limited as much as possible by the design of the equipment and be within safety limits.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0018">Generally, the present invention provides improved dialysis systems and improved methods of performing dialysis. More particularly, the present invention provides systems and methods for performing automated peritoneal dialysis (“APD”). The systems and methods of the present invention automatically provide dialysis therapy by providing dialysis fluid to the patient and draining spent dialysis fluid from the patient.</p>
  <p num="p-0019">Also, the systems and methods of the present invention can perform various dialysis therapies. One example of a dialysis therapy which can be performed according to the present invention includes an automatic dialysis fluid exchange of a patient fill, dwell and a patient drain. The dialysis system of the present invention can automatically perform dialysis therapy on a patient, for example, during nighttime while the patient sleeps.</p>
  <p num="p-0020">To this end, in an embodiment a dialysis system is provided. The system includes a fluid supply line. A disposable unit is in fluid communication with the fluid supply line. The disposable unit has at least two flexible membranes that bond together at selected locations and to a rigid plastic piece or manifold. The membranes can be single or double layer. One preferred membrane material is described herein. The membranes seal to one another so as to define a fluid pump receptacle and a fluid heating pathway. The membranes and plastic manifold define a number of flexible valve chambers. The disposable unit also fluidly communicates with a patient line and a drain line.</p>
  <p num="p-0021">The manifold and other areas of the disposable unit include reduced or tapered edges that provide an area to seal the membranes. The reduced thickness or tapered area requires less heat than the full thickness, which reduces the heat sinking disparity between the thickness of the manifold of the disposable unit and the thinner flexible membranes. The frame of the manifold is bowed or curved to provide rigidity. The frame is also asymmetrical and designed to be placed into the hardware unit in only one direction.</p>
  <p num="p-0022">The hardware unit can be manually transported to a patient's home and opened so that the patient can place a disposable unit therein and closed so that the dialysis unit and the disposable unit cooperatively form a pump chamber that enables dialysis fluid to be pumped to and from the patient. The hardware unit has an enclosure that defines a pump shell, a valve actuator and a heater. The disposable unit is placed in and removed from the enclosure. The fluid pump receptacle of the disposable unit and the shell of the hardware unit form a pump chamber. The pump chamber operates with a pump actuator, which is also located inside the transportable hardware unit.</p>
  <p num="p-0023">When packaged, a plurality of tubes extend from the disposable unit. The ends of the tubes have connectors that attach to a single body. The body defines or provides a plurality of tip protectors that hold the tubes in an order according to steps of the therapy. The body is configured to slide into the hardware unit of the system from one direction, so that a patient can readily pull the tubes and connectors from the tip protector organizer.</p>
  <p num="p-0024">The tip protector used to house the patient fluid connector includes a hydrophobic filter that allows air but not fluid to escape. This vented tip protector enables the system to be primed without having to perform elevation balancing or controlled fluid metering. The system performs a prime by flowing fluid through the system and into the patient fluid line until the dialysate backs up against the filter, causing a fluid pressure increase, which is sensed by the system. The system then stops the pump.</p>
  <p num="p-0025">The hardware unit also provides a controller. The controller includes a plurality of processors, a memory device for each processor and input/output capability. One of the processors coordinates operation of the pump actuator, the valve actuator and the heater with the various stages of dialysate flow, such as the fill, dwell and drain stages. The processor also controls or obtains feedback from a plurality of different types of sensors. The sensors include, among others, a capacitance fluid volume sensor, a dialysis fluid temperature sensor, a pressure sensor, a vacuum sensor, an air detection sensor and a mechanical positioning sensor.</p>
  <p num="p-0026">In an embodiment, the system uses both preset motion control and adaptive pressure control to control the pressure of fluid within the pump receptacle. The system uses a preset pump motor acceleration to overcome system compliance (i.e., membrane and tubing expansion), which would not otherwise be readily overcome by known proportional, differential or integral control. After the system overcomes compliance, the system converts to an adaptive control using adaptive techniques for controlling pressure by precisely controlling the velocity of a pump motor shaft. The adaptive parameters are modified over time to fine tune the system. This method is especially important for the patient fill and drain cycles, wherein the patient can feel pressure fluctuations. The method also readily compensates for pressure variations due to bag height, bag fullness, etc.</p>
  <p num="p-0027">The capacitance fluid volume sensor indicates a volume of fluid in the pump chamber, wherein the sensor generates a voltage signal that is indicative of the volume of fluid in the receptacle. The controller receives the voltage signal and converts the signal into an amount of fluid or an amount of air within the flexible fluid receptacle of the pump chamber.</p>
  <p num="p-0028">The pump actuator can be mechanically or pneumatically operated. When mechanically driven, a pump motor drives a vacuum source, such as a piston-cylinder, which pulls a vacuum on the membranes of the fluid receptacle of the disposable unit. Here, a mechanical positioning sensor, such as an encoder, senses the angle of a pump motor shaft relative to a home position and sends a signal to the controller, wherein the controller can adjust the pump motor accordingly. The encoder also provides safety feedback to the controller, whereby the controller, once therapy starts, prevents the camshaft from rotating to a position where the valves can free fill the patient. When the pump actuator is pneumatically operated, the system in an embodiment uses a vacuum pump to pull apart the membranes of the fluid receptacle. Here, the system uses a vacuum sensor to sense the state of the vacuum pump and a mechanical sensing device, such as a linear encoder, to sense the state of a pump piston.</p>
  <p num="p-0029">Thus, in an embodiment, the system maintains a negative pressure on one of the membranes of the fluid receptacle of the disposable unit to pull same away from the other membrane and draw dialysis fluid into the fluid receptacle. The negative pressure on the active membrane is then released, which pushes the membrane towards the other membrane and dispels the dialysis fluid from the pump receptacle. In another embodiment, a mechanical pump piston can be pneumatically attached to one of the membranes, wherein the system mechanically pulls the membrane away from the other membrane. In an embodiment, the membrane is coupled to the pump piston through negative pressure. The pump also includes a diaphragm that is pulled to a bottom side of the piston head, wherein the membrane is pulled to a top side of same. In a further embodiment, the system mechanically pushes one of the membranes while applying the negative pressure to same.</p>
  <p num="p-0030">The system also performs other necessary tasks automatically. For example, the system automatically heats the dialysate to a desired temperature while pumping dialysate to the patient. The heater heats the fluid heating pathway defined by the flexible membranes of the disposable unit. In an embodiment, the heater includes an electrical heating plate. Alternatively, or in addition to the heating plate, the heater includes an infrared heating source. In an embodiment, the fluid heating pathway and the heater define an in-line heater that heats dialysate as it travels from the supply bag to the patient.</p>
  <p num="p-0031">The system employs a method of heat control that uses a knowledge-based algorithm and a fuzzy logic based algorithm. The former uses laws of physics, empirical data and sensed inputted signals. The latter inputs a difference between desired and actual temperatures and uses fuzzy logic membership functions and fuzzy logic rules. Each algorithm operates at a different update frequency. Each algorithm outputs a duty cycle, wherein the system weights the fuzzy logic based duty cycle relative to the knowledge based duty cycle and produces an overall heater control duty cycle. This method enables accurate dialysate temperature control.</p>
  <p num="p-0032">The system automatically purges air from the dialysate, for example, through the pump chamber. The system also senses a total volume of fluid pumped to the patient, records and logs same. Furthermore, the system knows the instantaneous flow rate and fluid pressure of fluid entering or leaving the patient's peritoneal cavity.</p>
  <p num="p-0033">The disposable unit includes a valve manifold. The manifold defines a plurality of valve chambers. The hardware unit includes a valve actuator that selectively and sequentially presses against one or more of the valve chambers. In an embodiment, a mechanically operated valve actuator includes a single camshaft and a plurality of cams. The cams press against one of the membranes of the disposable unit to engage the other membrane and block or disallow fluid flow. As stated above, the system uses a sensing device, such as a rotary encoder, to sense the angle of the camshaft relative to a home position, so that the controller can rotate the camshaft to open or close one or more valves as desired. The single camshaft toggles back and forth between: supply and pump chamber fill positions; patient drain and system drain positions; and between pump chamber fill and patient fill positions. These positions are actuated by a unique rotational position on an overall cam profile (i.e., the superposition of each of the individual cams as seen from the end of the camshaft).</p>
  <p num="p-0034">The disposable unit of the present invention is provided in a variety of different forms. In an embodiment, the portion of the disposable unit forming the heating path is formed by the same membranes that seal to the rigid member or manifold that forms the valve chambers. The same membranes also form the pump receptacle. In another embodiment, the disposable unit includes a first set of membranes that form the pump receptacle and the valve manifold via the rigid member. Here, the disposable unit includes a second set of membranes, distinct from the first membranes, which form the fluid heating path. In an embodiment, medical grade tubing connects the first set of membranes to the second set. In particular, the tubing enables the fluid heating path to fluidly connect to the valve manifold.</p>
  <p num="p-0035">The disposable unit in another embodiment includes a first flexible membrane and a second flexible membrane that house the pump receptacle, the fluid heating path and the rigid valve manifold. The disposable unit also includes a rigid frame that attaches to at least one of the first and second flexible membranes. The rigid frame enables a patient or operator to place the frame and the disposable unit into the enclosure of the hardware unit of the automated dialysis system. The rigid frame is sized to securely fit into a dedicated place in the enclosure. The rigid frame further holds the disposable unit stable while the patient or operator connects tubes to same. For example, the valve manifold provides ports or other types of connectors for connecting to a supply line, a drain line and a patient line. In an embodiment, the rigid frame extends around or circumvents the membranes including the pump receptacle, fluid heating path and valve manifold. In an embodiment, the rigid frame is plastic. In an embodiment, the rigid frame is bowed along at least two sides to increase the rigidly of the disposable unit and to keep the disposable unit from deforming during the heat sealing portion of its manufacture.</p>
  <p num="p-0036">In an embodiment, the rigid member or manifold of the disposable unit includes interfaces that allow the membranes to be more easily sealed to the manifold. The manifold edges are tapered to reduce the heat needed to form a cohesive bond between the membranes and the plastic valve manifold. The knife-like tapered edges also reduce or eliminate the gap between the top and bottom membranes, which minimizes the opportunity for leaks to occur in the disposable unit. The chamfered edges also reduce the likelihood that the heat sealing process will burn through the membranes.</p>
  <p num="p-0037">The hardware unit described above includes a display device that provides dialysis system information. The display device also enables the patient or operator to enter information and commands into the controller. For example, the display device can include an associated touch screen that enables the patient or operator to initiate automatic flow of the dialysate through the disposable unit. The system begins to pneumatically and/or mechanically pump dialysate through the pump chamber, past the in-line heater and into the patient's peritoneal cavity. Thereafter, the system automatically runs the other cycles of dialysis therapy, for example, while the patient sleeps and/or at night. The automated system not only transfers dialysate from a supply container to the patient, the system allows the dialysate to dwell inside the patient for an amount of time and automatically operates to transfer the dialysate from the patient to a drain.</p>
  <p num="p-0038">The system provides a graphical user interface (“GUI”). The GUI in an embodiment employs an embedded web browser and an embedded web server. The web browser and server operate on a main microprocessor for the system. The GUI also employs instrument access and control software, which operates on the main system processor and on one or more delegate processors. The instrument access and control software controls lower level devices, such as the heater and the pump. The GUI also provides intermediate software that allows the web browser to communicate with the instrument access and control software.</p>
  <p num="p-0039">The GUI displays a number of therapy set-up screens and a number of dialysis treatment screens. The set-up screens generally walk the patient through the set-up portion of the therapy. The system waits for an operator input before proceeding to the next set-up screen. The set-up screens provide information to the patient in the form of real-life images of the equipment and through animations of the actions needed to connect the system to the patient.</p>
  <p num="p-0040">The therapy treatment screens display the various cycles of the therapy to the patient in real-time or substantially in-real time. The therapy treatment screens display information such as cycle time in both a graphical and quantitative manner. The therapy treatment screens do not require input from a patient, who may be sleeping while these screens are displayed. When the therapy is complete, the system once again displays a number of disconnection screens which, like the set-up screens, wait for an input from the patient before performing an action.</p>
  <p num="p-0041">The treatment screens are colored and lighted for night time viewing, and may be easily seen from a distance of about ten to fifteen feet, however, the screens are lighted so as not to wake a sleeping patient. In an embodiment, the background of the screens is black, while the graphics are ruby red. In contrast, the set-up screens are lighted and colored for daytime viewing.</p>

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0081">The present invention relates to dialysis systems and methods of performing dialysis. In particular, the present invention relates to a system and method for automatically providing peritoneal dialysis therapy to patients. The present invention provides automatic multiple exchanges of dialysis fluid to and from the patient's peritoneal cavity. The automatic exchanges of dialysate include drain, fill, and dwell periods, which usually occur while the patient sleeps. A typical therapy can include three to five exchanges of dialysis fluid. The present invention, in an embodiment, provides a single pass system, wherein the dialysate passes through the peritoneal cavity only once before being disposed. While the present invention performs peritoneal dialysis, it is also suitable for other types of dialysis and other medical fluid transfer operations.</p>
  <heading>I. The System Generally</heading> <p num="p-0082">Referring now to the drawings and in particular to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a typical therapy performed by the system <b>10</b> of the present invention begins by draining dialysis solution that is already in the patient's peritoneal cavity <b>12</b>. The system <b>10</b> pumps fresh dialysate from one of a plurality of supply bags <b>14</b>, through an in-line heater <b>16</b> to the patient or peritoneal cavity <b>12</b>. After a dwell period in the peritoneal cavity <b>12</b>, the spent dialysate in the cavity is pumped out of the patient or cavity <b>12</b> to a drain <b>18</b> or other disposal means. The system <b>10</b> then pumps fresh dialysate from the supply bags <b>14</b> to the patient or peritoneal cavity <b>12</b> and the procedure is repeated as defined in the therapy protocol. The system <b>10</b> in an embodiment pumps a last bag of dialysate (usually, a dialysate having a different formulation than the dialysate in the other supply bags) to the peritoneal cavity <b>12</b> for an extended dwell, such as a daytime dwell.</p>
  <p num="p-0083">In an embodiment, the system <b>10</b> includes a mechanically operated diaphragm pump <b>20</b>. The mechanically operated diaphragm pump <b>20</b> employs a pump motor <b>22</b> and a linear pump actuator <b>24</b>. A vacuum may also be used with the mechanical actuator for the diaphragm pump <b>20</b>, as described in further detail below. In another embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the pump is completely fluidly activated.</p>
  <p num="p-0084">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the system <b>10</b> also includes a valve actuator <b>26</b>, which mechanically actuates valves V<b>1</b> to V<b>5</b>. A controller <b>30</b> controls the valve actuator <b>26</b> to open valves V<b>1</b> to V<b>5</b> as necessary to achieve the desired direction of dialysate fluid flow. In an embodiment, the valve actuator <b>26</b> includes a valve motor <b>28</b> and a camshaft (illustrated below), which opens one or more of the valves V<b>1</b> to V<b>5</b> to achieve the desired dialysate flow.</p>
  <p num="p-0085">The controller <b>30</b> includes a plurality of processors and a memory device for each processor. The processors include a main microprocessor and a number of delegate processors. The main microprocessor runs certain higher level tasks such as the graphical user interface (“GUI”) described below. The delegate processors perform lower level tasks, such as moving valves, reading sensors, controlling heater duty cycle, etc. An additional processor is provided solely for the purpose of tracking safety parameters, such as heater plate and medical fluid temperature. For purposes of the present invention, except where otherwise specified, the term “processor <b>34</b>” refers collectively to all of the processors and the term “memory device <b>32</b>” refers collectively to all of the corresponding memory devices.</p>
  <p num="p-0086">The controller <b>30</b> also includes an input/output (“I/O”) module <b>36</b>. The device memory device <b>32</b> stores a computer program that contains a step by step sequence for the system <b>10</b> and configures certain outputs to occur upon specified inputs. The processor <b>34</b> runs the program in the memory <b>32</b>. The I/O module <b>36</b> accepts signal lines from various sensors. The I/O module <b>36</b> also connects to power lines including input power lines (including if battery powered) and power lines outputted to the various electrical components.</p>
  <p num="p-0087">The controller <b>30</b>, in an embodiment, includes a video controller <b>38</b>, which may be a video card. The controller <b>30</b> also includes a display device or video monitor <b>40</b> that displays medical treatment or dialysis information to a patient or operator. In an embodiment, the controller <b>30</b> further includes a touch screen <b>42</b> that interfaces with the video monitor <b>40</b> and electrically communicates with the I/O module <b>36</b>. The touch screen <b>42</b> enables the patient or operator to input medical treatment or dialysis information into the controller <b>30</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0088">The controller <b>30</b> controls the heater <b>16</b>, the pump <b>20</b> and the valve actuator <b>26</b> in a number of different phases that make up a single medical or dialysis treatment. In a first pump fill phase, controller <b>30</b> activates the pump <b>20</b> to pump medical fluid or dialysate from one of the supply bags <b>14</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the controller <b>30</b> commands a vacuum source <b>44</b>, including an air pump motor <b>46</b>, to pull a vacuum on both sides of the pump <b>20</b> through a first vacuum line <b>48</b> and a second vacuum line <b>50</b>. The vacuum lines <b>48</b> and <b>50</b> pull respective vacuums through first and second pump chamber walls to suction one of a pair of opposing membranes inside the pump chamber against the interior of the pump chamber. The other membrane is held against a piston head in the pump <b>20</b>. The other membrane alternatively temporarily or permanently mechanically attaches to the piston head, rendering the vacuum on the piston side of the pump <b>20</b> unnecessary.</p>
  <p num="p-0089">With the membranes maintained against the interior of the pump chamber and the piston head, the controller <b>30</b> commands the linear actuator <b>24</b> to withdraw within the pump <b>20</b>. The withdrawal causes the membranes inside the pump chamber to pull further apart. At this time, the controller <b>30</b> controls the valve actuator <b>26</b> so that only valve V<b>1</b> is open. The pulling apart of the membranes causes a negative pressure to occur in fill line <b>52</b>, wherein the negative pressure pulls medical fluid or dialysate from the supply bag <b>14</b>, through the fill line <b>52</b>, into a receptacle created by the opened membranes inside the pump chamber of pump <b>20</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0090">In a patient fill phase, with the negative pressure still maintained by the vacuum source <b>44</b>, through the pump chamber walls, on the interior membranes, the controller <b>30</b> causes the linear pump actuator <b>24</b> to move upwards within the pump <b>20</b>. The upward movement of the actuator <b>24</b> and an attached piston head provides a positive mechanical pressure that closes the membrane receptacle and thereby pumps the medical fluid out of the pump <b>20</b>. At this time, the controller <b>30</b> controls the valve actuator <b>26</b> so that only valves V<b>2</b> and V<b>3</b> are open. Consequently, all of the fluid exiting pump <b>20</b> is pumped through a heater line <b>54</b>, past the in-line heater <b>16</b>, through a catheter line <b>56</b>, and into the patient, for example, the patient's peritoneal cavity <b>12</b>. The catheter line <b>56</b> in an embodiment connects to a single lumen catheter, which is implanted into the patient <b>12</b>. Although, in other embodiments, the system <b>10</b> can employ a multi-lumen catheter.</p>
  <p num="p-0091">The heater <b>16</b> in an embodiment includes one or more electrical heating plates, which heat the medical fluid to roughly body temperature. The controller <b>30</b> energizes and de-energizes the heater <b>16</b> as necessary to obtain the proper fluid temperature. The controller <b>30</b> can close valves V<b>2</b> and V<b>3</b>, located on opposing sides of the heater <b>16</b> in the heater line <b>54</b>, if the medical fluid is too hot or too cold. The improperly heated dialysate does not enter the peritoneal cavity <b>12</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0092">The controller <b>20</b> repeats the pump fill phase and the heater fill phase until the patient's the peritoneal cavity <b>12</b> becomes full of fluid according to the therapy protocol. In an embodiment, the volume inside the pump is about thirty to fifty milliliters, and an adult patient typically uses about two liters of dialysis fluid. Accordingly, the pump fill phase and the heater fill phase can be repeated on the order of fifty times. In an embodiment, the pump actuator <b>24</b> maintains a fluid pressure at the pump <b>20</b> of about three pounds per square inch (“psi”).</p>
  <p num="p-0093">The system <b>10</b> provides a fluid volume sensor <b>60</b>, which measures the actual volume of medical fluid that has been forced through the pump <b>20</b>. By summing multiple individual pump volumes, the controller accurately knows how much medical fluid or dialysate has been delivered to the patient <b>12</b>. The system <b>10</b> in an embodiment repeats the pump fill phase and the heater fill phase until the pump <b>20</b> has delivered a predetermined volume of medical fluid. The predetermined volume can be inputted into the controller <b>30</b> by a patient or operator via the touch screen <b>42</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0094">In a dwell phase, the controller <b>30</b> lets the medical fluid or dialysate remain within the patient <b>12</b> for an amount of time, which can be controlled by the controller <b>30</b>, the patient <b>12</b> or an operator. In an embodiment, the controller <b>30</b> determines the dwell time, but the patient <b>12</b> or operator can override the system <b>10</b> and command that the system <b>10</b> remove the medical fluid from the patient <b>12</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0095">In a second pump fill phase, the medical fluid is removed from the patient <b>12</b>. The controller <b>30</b> and the actuator <b>26</b> open valve V<b>4</b>, while shutting the remaining valves. With the vacuum source still maintaining a negative pressure on the membranes inside the pump <b>20</b>, the linear actuator <b>24</b> withdraws the pump piston within the chamber of pump <b>20</b> and reopens the receptacle between the membranes. The negative pressure created by the opening receptacle pulls the medical fluid from the patient <b>12</b>, through the catheter line <b>56</b> and into the membrane receptacle formed inside the pump <b>20</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0096">In a drain phase, with the negative pressure still maintained by the vacuum source <b>44</b>, through the pump chamber walls, on the interior membranes, the controller <b>30</b> causes the linear pump actuator <b>24</b> to move upwardly within the pump <b>20</b>. The upward movement of the actuator <b>24</b> causes a positive mechanical pressure to close the membrane receptacle and thereby pump the medical fluid out of the pump <b>20</b>. At this time, the controller <b>30</b> controls the valve actuator <b>26</b> so that only valve V<b>5</b> is open. Consequently, all of the fluid exiting pump <b>20</b> is pumped through a drain line <b>58</b> and into the drain <b>18</b>. Drain <b>18</b> can be a drain bag or a drain pipe inside a home, a hospital or elsewhere.</p>
  <p num="p-0097">One embodiment of the fluid volume sensor <b>60</b> is described in more detail below in connection with the description of the diaphragm pump <b>20</b>. Besides the fluid volume sensor <b>60</b>, the system <b>10</b> includes various other desired types of sensors.</p>
  <p num="p-0098">The system <b>10</b> includes temperature sensors <b>62</b>, such as the sensors T<b>1</b> to T<b>4</b>, which measure the temperature at relevant places within the system <b>10</b>. In an embodiment, the sensors <b>62</b> are non-invasive, however, any other types of temperature sensors may be employed. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, sensors T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> provide redundant post heater feedback of the fluid temperature to the controller <b>30</b>. Sensor T<b>3</b> provides a temperature of the medical fluid prior to heating. Sensor T<b>4</b> provides the ambient temperature.</p>
  <p num="p-0099">The system <b>10</b> also provides temperature sensors <b>62</b> that monitor the temperature of the heater <b>16</b>. In an embodiment, the heater <b>16</b> is an in-line plate heater. The in-line plate heater <b>16</b> can have one or more heater plates, for example, two heater plates having a disposable unit placed between same. Separate temperature sensors PT<b>1</b> and PT<b>2</b> are provided to monitor the temperature of each of the plates of the plate heater. The system <b>10</b> can thereby control each plate heater individually.</p>
  <p num="p-0100">The system <b>10</b> includes one or more air sensors <b>64</b>, such as the sensor AS<b>1</b>, placed directly at the throat of the inlet and outlet of the pump <b>20</b>. Another air sensor AS<b>2</b> monitors air in the medical fluid after it leaves the heater <b>16</b> and just before the final shut-off valve V<b>3</b> leading to the catheter line <b>56</b>. The controller <b>30</b> monitors the air content sensed by the air sensors <b>64</b> and thereby controls the system <b>10</b> to perform any necessary air purge. The system <b>10</b> can separate and discharge the air from the fluid or simply convey the air to the drain <b>18</b>. The system <b>10</b> also includes an air vent solenoid <b>66</b>, which is operated by the controller <b>30</b>. The air vent solenoid <b>66</b> enables the system <b>10</b> to relieve the vacuum applied to one or both of the membranes in the pump <b>20</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0101">The system <b>10</b> can accumulate air for various reasons. For example, the valves V<b>1</b> to V<b>5</b> and fluid lines, such as lines <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> may contain air prior to priming the system <b>10</b>. The supply bags <b>14</b> may also introduce air into the pump <b>20</b>. The patient <b>12</b> can also produce certain gasses, which become entrained in the dialysate and enter the pump <b>20</b>. Further, if minor leaks exist in the fluid disposable or the connections to the supply bag <b>14</b>, the catheter at the patient <b>12</b>, or the drain bag, the pump <b>20</b> can draw air in through the leaks.</p>
  <p num="p-0102">The system <b>10</b> provides various fluid pressure sensors <b>68</b>. Fluid pressure sensors FP<b>1</b> and FP<b>2</b> provide a redundant pressure reading of the fluid in the fill line <b>52</b> leading to the pump <b>60</b>. The fluid pressure sensors <b>68</b> provide a signal to the controller <b>30</b> that indicates the respective fluid pressure at that location. Based on the signals from the pressure sensors FP<b>1</b> and FP<b>2</b>, the controller <b>30</b> operates the fluid pumps and valves to obtain and maintain a desired fluid pressure. As stated above, the system <b>10</b> maintains the pump pressure, for example, at about three psi.</p>
  <p num="p-0103">The system <b>10</b> also provides various valve pressure sensors <b>70</b>. Valve pressure sensors VP<b>1</b> to VP<b>5</b> detect the fluid pressure at the valves V<b>1</b> to V<b>5</b>. The system <b>10</b> further provides one or more vacuum pressure sensors <b>72</b>, for example, at the vacuum source <b>44</b>, to ensure that a proper vacuum is maintained on the membrane receptacle within the pump <b>20</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0104">In an embodiment, the fluid pressure, valve pressure and vacuum sensors <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> and <b>72</b>, respectively, are non-invasive sensors. That is, the sensors do not physically contact (and possibly contaminate) the medical fluid or dialysate. Of course, the system <b>10</b> can include other flow and pressure devices, such as flow rate sensors, pressure gauges, flowmeters, or pressure regulators in any suitable quantity and at any desired location.</p>
  <p num="p-0105">The system <b>10</b> also includes various positioning sensors. In an embodiment, the positioning sensors include a linear encoder <b>74</b> that monitors the position of the linear pump actuator <b>24</b> and a rotary encoder <b>76</b> that monitors the angular position of the valve actuator <b>26</b> or camshaft. An encoder is one type of positioning feedback device that can be employed. Other types of positioning feedback systems include proximity sensors and magnetic pick-ups that sense a pulse, e.g., a gear tooth of a gear attached to the camshaft, and output the pulse to a counter or microprocessor.</p>
  <p num="p-0106">The encoders <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> also typically provide a pulsed output, which is sent to the controller <b>30</b>. The pulsed output tells the controller <b>30</b> how many steps or how far the linear pump actuator <b>24</b> or the valve actuator <b>26</b> is from a home position or home index <b>78</b>. For example, the home position <b>78</b> can be the pump fully open or pump fully closed position for the linear encoder <b>74</b> and the zero degree position for the rotary encoder <b>76</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0107">In an embodiment, the encoders <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> are absolute type encoders that know the location of the home position <b>78</b> even after a power loss. In another embodiment, the encoders <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> are incremental encoders and a battery back-up is provided to the controller so that the system <b>10</b> can maintain the location of the home position <b>78</b> even when no external power is applied. Further alternatively, system <b>10</b> can be programmed to automatically move the pump actuator <b>24</b> and the valve actuator <b>26</b> upon power-up until a home position is sensed, wherein the system <b>10</b> can begin to run the main sequence.</p>
  <p num="p-0108">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an alternative system <b>100</b> is illustrated. The system <b>100</b> includes many of the same components having the same functionality (and the same reference numbers) as previously described. These components therefore do not need to be described again except to the extent that their functioning with the new components of system <b>100</b> differs. The primary difference between the system <b>100</b> and the system <b>10</b> is that the pump <b>120</b> of the system <b>100</b> is completely fluidly actuated and does not use the linear pump actuator <b>24</b> of the system <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0109">In the pump fill phases, described above, the controller <b>30</b> activates the pump <b>120</b> to pump medical fluid or dialysate from one of the supply bags <b>14</b>. To do so, the controller <b>30</b> commands vacuum source <b>44</b> (shown separately from motor <b>46</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), including a vacuum pump motor <b>46</b>, to pull a vacuum on both sides of the pump <b>120</b>, i.e., on both pump membranes, through vacuum lines <b>148</b> and <b>149</b>. The vacuum pump motor <b>46</b> in this embodiment includes a rotary encoder <b>76</b> and a home position or home index <b>78</b>. The rotary encoder <b>76</b> provides positional feedback of a member <b>150</b> within the vacuum source <b>44</b>. The system <b>100</b> therefore knows if the vacuum source <b>44</b> can provide any additional suction or if the member <b>150</b> has bottomed out within the vacuum source <b>44</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0110">To draw in medical fluid, the vacuum line <b>148</b> pulls a vacuum through first and second pump chamber walls to the pair of opposing membranes inside the pump chamber. The vacuum pulls the membranes against the interior of the pump chamber. At this time, the controller <b>30</b> controls the valve actuator <b>26</b> so that only valve V<b>1</b> is open. The pulling apart of the membranes causes a negative pressure to occur in fill line <b>52</b>, wherein the negative pressure pulls medical fluid or dialysate from the supply bag <b>14</b>, through the fill line <b>52</b>, into a receptacle created by the volume between the membranes inside the pump chamber of pump <b>120</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0111">In an alternative embodiment, the pump <b>120</b> maintains a constant vacuum on one of the membranes, wherein the opposing membrane does the pumping work. To pump fluid out, the vacuum on one or both membranes is released. The membranes, which have been stretched apart, spring back to a closed position. This operation is described in detail below.</p>
  <p num="p-0112">The system <b>100</b> also includes a slightly different valve manifold than the system <b>10</b>. The system <b>100</b> includes one less valve than the system <b>10</b>, wherein the system <b>100</b> does not provide an extra valve (V<b>3</b> in system <b>10</b>) directly after the fluid heater <b>16</b>. Obviously, those of skill in the art can find many ways to configure the valves and fluid flow lines of the systems <b>10</b> and <b>100</b>. Consequently, the configuration of the valves and fluid flow lines of the systems <b>10</b> and <b>100</b> as illustrated merely represent practical examples, and the present invention is not limited to same.</p>
  <heading>II. Hardware Unit and Disposable Unit</heading> <p num="p-0113">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B, <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B, both systems <b>10</b> and <b>100</b> include a hardware unit <b>110</b> and a disposable unit <b>160</b>. The hardware unit <b>110</b> in an embodiment is portable and can be transported to and from a person's home. The hardware unit <b>110</b> includes a housing <b>112</b> that includes a base <b>114</b> and a lid <b>116</b>. In an embodiment, the lid <b>116</b> is hinged to the base <b>114</b>. Alternatively, the lid <b>116</b> is completely removable from the base. The lid <b>116</b> in either case opens to provide access to the interior of the housing <b>112</b>, so as to allow the patient or operator to place and remove the disposable unit <b>160</b> into and from the hardware unit <b>110</b>. The hardware unit <b>110</b> can be made of any protective, hard, resilient and/or flexible material, for example, plastic or metal sheet, and can have a decorative and/or finished surface.</p>
  <p num="p-0114">Once the disposable unit <b>160</b> is placed inside the hardware unit <b>110</b>, the operator closes the lid <b>116</b> and uses one or more locking or latching mechanism <b>118</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) to safely house the disposable unit <b>160</b> within the hardware unit <b>110</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates members <b>119</b> of the housing <b>112</b> to which the latching mechanism <b>118</b> of the lid <b>116</b> attaches. The hardware unit <b>110</b> displays the video monitor <b>40</b>, which can have an associated touch screen <b>42</b> to input commands as described above. Alternatively, or in addition to the touch screen <b>42</b>, the hardware unit <b>110</b> can provide one or more electromechanical switches or pushbuttons <b>43</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>125</b> and <b>127</b>, analog controls <b>122</b> and/or lighted displays. The pushbuttons or switches <b>43</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>125</b> and <b>127</b> and knob <b>122</b> enable the patient or operator to input commands and information into the systems <b>10</b> and <b>100</b>. The video monitor <b>40</b> provides medical treatment information <b>126</b> to the patient or operator.</p>
  <p num="p-0115"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates one set of dimensions for the hardware unit <b>110</b> of the present invention. The size and weight of the present invention are less than previous automated dialysis system. This feature belies the portability and ease of use of the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> of the present invention. The size and weight enable the hardware unit <b>110</b> to be shipped economically by standard overnight courier services. In the event that the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> of the present invention breaks down, a replacement unit can be economically shipped to the patient in time for the next therapy.</p>
  <p num="p-0116">The hardware unit <b>110</b> in an embodiment is approximately 23 to 30 cm high and deep and in one preferred embodiment, as illustrated, about 25 cm high and deep. The hardware unit <b>110</b> in an embodiment is approximately 32 to 40 cm wide and in one preferred embodiment, as illustrated, about 34 cm wide. The internal volume of the unit <b>110</b> is therefore about 17,000 cm<sup>3 </sup>to about 36,000 cm<sup>3</sup>, and in one preferred embodiment, approximately 21,250 cm<sup>3 </sup>(1310 in<sup>3</sup>). Section view <b>4</b>B aptly illustrates the many components maintained within this compact space and the efficient use of same. All these components and the hardware unit <b>110</b> have a total mass of about six to nine kilograms (kg) and in one preferred embodiment about seven kilograms.</p>
  <p num="p-0117"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 4B</figref> also illustrate that the architecture, configuration and layout of the hardware unit <b>110</b> provides an automated system that is also convenient to use. The components of the system <b>10</b>,<b>100</b> with which the patient must interact are placed on the top, front and sides of the unit <b>110</b>. The flow control components are placed below the heater <b>116</b>, which is placed below the disposable unit loading station. The monitor <b>40</b> and controls <b>43</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>125</b> and <b>127</b> are placed in the front of the unit <b>110</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0118">The hardware unit <b>110</b> contains the pump <b>20</b> or <b>120</b> and the linear pump actuator <b>24</b> if system <b>10</b> is employed. The hardware unit <b>110</b> also contains the valve actuator <b>26</b> including the valve motor <b>28</b>, the in-line heater <b>16</b>, the various sensors, the vacuum source <b>44</b> including the air pump motor <b>46</b> and the controller <b>30</b> as well as the other hardware described above. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates that one of the pump chamber walls of the pump <b>20</b> or <b>120</b> is disposed in the lid <b>116</b> of the housing. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the heater <b>16</b> is disposed in the base <b>114</b> of the housing <b>112</b>. Alternatively or additionally, the heater may be placed in the lid <b>116</b>. The base <b>114</b> also contains the opposing pump chamber wall.</p>
  <p num="p-0119">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>B, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, various embodiments of the disposable unit <b>160</b> are illustrated. In each of the embodiments, the disposable unit <b>160</b> includes a pair of flexible membranes, including an upper flexible membrane <b>162</b> and a lower flexible membrane <b>164</b>. The disposable unit <b>160</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> includes two pairs of flexible membranes, namely, membrane pair <b>166</b> and membrane pair <b>168</b>. Each of the membrane pairs <b>166</b> and <b>168</b> also includes the upper flexible membrane <b>162</b> and the lower flexible membrane <b>164</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0120">The flexible membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> can be made of any suitable sterile and inert material, such as a sterile and inert plastic or rubber. For example, the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> can be buna-N, butyl, hypalon, kel-F, kynar, neoprene, nylon, polyethylene, polystyrene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, silicone, vinyl, viton or any combination of these. One preferred material for the flexible membrane is described below in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0121">The membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> are sealed together in various places to create fluid flow paths and receptacles between the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b>. The seals are heat seals, adhesive seals or a combination of both. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>4</b>A, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> illustrate that a generally circular seal <b>170</b> creates a substantially circular fluid pump receptacle <b>172</b> between the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b>. The pump receptacle <b>172</b> operates with the fluid pumps. Instead of the seal <b>170</b>, one alternative embodiment is for the base <b>114</b> and lid <b>116</b> to press the membranes together to form the seal. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 5</figref> illustrate that in an embodiment, the disposable unit <b>160</b> provides a secondary seal <b>174</b> to protect the systems <b>10</b> and <b>100</b> in case the primary seal <b>170</b> leaks or degrades during use.</p>
  <p num="p-0122"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B illustrate that the fluid pump receptacle <b>172</b> fits between the clamshell shapes of the pumps <b>20</b> and <b>120</b> in the lid <b>116</b>. The clamshell shapes defined by the base <b>114</b> and lid <b>116</b> of the hardware unit <b>110</b> together with the fluid pump receptacle <b>172</b> form the pump chamber of the pumps <b>20</b> and <b>120</b> of the present invention. The clamshell shapes in the base <b>114</b> and lid <b>116</b> include one or more ports with which to draw a vacuum on the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b>. In this manner, the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> are pulled towards and conform to the clamshell shapes in the base <b>114</b> and lid <b>116</b> and thereby create a negative pressure inside the receptacle <b>172</b> that pulls medical fluid from a supply bag <b>14</b> located outside the hardware unit <b>110</b>, into the receptacle <b>172</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0123"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>4</b>A, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> illustrate that a generally rectangular, spiral seal <b>178</b> creates a spiral heating path <b>180</b> between the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b>. The fluid heating path <b>180</b> runs from a valve manifold <b>190</b>, through the spiral section, and back to the valve manifold <b>190</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates that the fluid heating path <b>180</b> fits between the heating plates of the heater <b>16</b>, which reside in the base <b>114</b> and lid <b>116</b> of the hardware unit <b>110</b>. Providing a heat source on either side of the fluid heating path <b>180</b> enables the medical fluid to be quickly and efficiently heated. In alternative embodiments, however, the heater <b>16</b> can include only a single heater on one side of the fluid heating path <b>180</b> defined by the disposable unit <b>160</b> or multiple heaters on each side of the disposable unit <b>160</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0124">The upper and lower membranes <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> are attached to the disposable unit <b>160</b> utilizing heat sealing techniques as described herein. The membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> are expandable so that when the disposable unit <b>160</b> is placed between a predefined gap between the upper and lower plates of the heater <b>16</b>, the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> expand and contact the heater plates. This causes conductive heating to take place between the plates of the heater <b>16</b> and the membranes <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> and between the membranes and the medical fluid. The predefined gap is slightly larger than the thickness of the disposable unit <b>160</b>. Specifically, when dialysate moves through the fluid heating path <b>180</b> of the disposable unit <b>160</b>, the membranes <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> of the spiral wound fluid heating pathway <b>180</b> expand between the spiral seal <b>178</b> and touch the plates of the heater <b>16</b>.</p>
  <heading>A. Separate Sets of Membranes</heading> <p num="p-0125">The disposable unit <b>160</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is similar to the disposable units <b>160</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 5</figref>. The in-line fluid heating path <b>180</b>, however, is placed in a separate membrane pair <b>166</b> from the fluid pump receptacle <b>172</b> and the valve manifold <b>190</b>, which are placed in a separate membrane pair <b>168</b>. A pair of flexible tubes <b>182</b> and <b>184</b>, which can be any suitable medical grade tubing, fluidly connect the valve manifold <b>190</b> to the fluid heating path <b>180</b>. The tubes <b>182</b> and <b>184</b> can be connected to the membrane pairs <b>166</b>, <b>168</b> by any desired means, such as, heat sealing, bonding, press-fitting or by any other permanent or removable fluid connection. When placed in the hardware unit <b>110</b>, the heater <b>16</b> heats each side of the heater membrane pair <b>166</b>, as in the other embodiments.</p>
  <p num="p-0126">Separating the fluid heating path <b>180</b> from the fluid pump receptacle <b>172</b> and the valve manifold <b>190</b> enables the membranes of the respective pairs to be made of different materials. It is desirable that the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> of the heating pair <b>166</b> conduct or radiate heat efficiently. On the other hand, it is desirable that the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> of the fluid flow pair <b>166</b> withstand the forces of suction and mechanical actuation. It may therefore be desirable to use dissimilar materials for the membrane pair <b>166</b> and the membrane pair <b>168</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0127">The membrane pair <b>166</b>, defining the heater fluid flow path <b>180</b>, additionally defines alignment holes <b>176</b> that align with pegs protruding from the base <b>114</b> or the lid <b>116</b> of the hardware unit <b>110</b>. Each of the embodiments of the disposable unit <b>160</b> disclosed herein may be adapted to include alignment holes <b>176</b>, which aid the patient or operator in properly placing the disposable unit <b>160</b> within the housing <b>112</b> of the hardware unit <b>110</b>.</p>
  <heading>B. Rigid Frame and Bowed Sides</heading> <p num="p-0128">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>4</b>A and <b>5</b>, each of the embodiments of the disposable unit <b>160</b> disclosed herein may also be adapted to provide a rigid or semi-rigid member or frame <b>186</b>, which in an embodiment, surrounds or substantially circumscribes the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> of the disposable unit <b>160</b>. In an embodiment, the rigid member or frame <b>186</b> is made of a sterile, inert, rigid or semi-rigid plastic, for example, from one of or a combination of the plastics listed above for the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b>. The frame <b>186</b> aids the patient or operator in properly placing the disposable unit <b>160</b> within the housing <b>112</b> of the hardware unit <b>110</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0129">In an embodiment, the housing <b>112</b> defines a pin or guide into which the frame <b>186</b> of the disposable unit <b>160</b> snugly fits. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates that the frame <b>186</b> defines an aperture <b>161</b> that fits onto the pin or guide of the housing <b>112</b>. The frame <b>186</b> can provide a plurality of apertures, such as the aperture <b>161</b>, which fit onto a like number of pins or guides provided by the housing <b>112</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> also illustrates that the frame <b>186</b> includes an asymmetrical member or chamfer <b>163</b>. The chamfer <b>163</b> forms an angle, such as forty-five degrees, with respect to the other sides of the frame <b>186</b>. The housing <b>112</b> defines or provides an area into which to place the disposable unit <b>160</b>. The area has the asymmetrical shape of the frame <b>186</b> or otherwise provides guides that only allow the unit <b>160</b> to be placed in the housing <b>112</b> from a single direction. The chamfer <b>163</b> and the cooperating housing <b>112</b> ensure that when the patient places the disposable unit <b>160</b> in the housing <b>112</b>, the bottom of the disposable unit <b>160</b> is placed in the housing <b>112</b> and the fluid inlets/outlets <b>196</b> face in the proper direction.</p>
  <p num="p-0130">As discussed above, the disposable unit <b>160</b> includes a valve manifold <b>190</b>. In an embodiment, the valve manifold <b>190</b> is made of a rigid or semi-rigid plastic, such as, from one of or a combination of the plastics listed above for the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b>. The valve manifold <b>190</b> is covered on either side by the upper and lower membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> to thereby create a sealed and inert logic flow path for the systems <b>10</b> and <b>100</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0131">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the manifold <b>190</b> defines holes <b>192</b> and slots <b>194</b>. The holes <b>192</b> define the location of the valves, for example, valves V<b>1</b> to V<b>5</b> of the system <b>10</b>. The slots <b>194</b> define the fluid flow paths from the valves to the fluid pump receptacle <b>172</b>, the fluid heating path <b>180</b> or to fluid inlets/outlets <b>196</b>. The fluid inlets/outlets <b>196</b> individually lead to the supply bag <b>14</b>, the catheter line <b>56</b>, the patient <b>12</b> and the drain <b>18</b>. The fluid inlets/outlets <b>196</b> may have various configurations and orientations, as contrasted by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. The drain <b>196</b> may also be adapted to connect to an external flexible tube via a method known to those of skill in the art.</p>
  <p num="p-0132">In an embodiment, the rigid or semi-rigid frame <b>186</b> includes bowed sides <b>187</b> and <b>189</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The bowed sides <b>187</b> and <b>189</b> are formed with the frame <b>186</b> before the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> heat seal or adhesively seal to the frame <b>186</b> and manifold <b>190</b>. The frame <b>186</b> and bowed sides <b>187</b> and <b>189</b> can be extruded plastic or plastic injection molded. The frame <b>186</b> can include as little as one bowed side, any number less than all, or have all sides be bowed.</p>
  <p num="p-0133">In the illustrated embodiment, the sides <b>187</b> and <b>189</b> bow outward although they can alternatively bow inward. In a preferred embodiment, the sides are bowed in a direction of the plane of the frame <b>186</b> of the disposable unit <b>160</b>. The bowed sides <b>187</b> and <b>189</b> increase the rigidity of the frame <b>186</b> and the disposable unit <b>160</b>. The disposable unit is accordingly more easily placed in the housing <b>112</b> of the hardware unit <b>110</b>. The bowed sides <b>187</b> and <b>189</b> reduce the amount of flexing or distortion of the frame <b>186</b> due to heat sealing or mechanically pressing membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> onto the frame <b>186</b> and manifold <b>190</b>.</p>
  <heading>C. Heat Seal Interface</heading> <p num="p-0134">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an embodiment for heat sealing the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> to the manifold <b>190</b> is illustrated. In an embodiment, the manifold <b>190</b> is made of a rigid or semi-rigid plastic material as described above. Heat sealing the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> to the semi-rigid manifold <b>190</b>, which in an embodiment is an injection molded component, requires different processing parameters than heat sealing the individual membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> together, for example, at seal <b>170</b> of the fluid pump receptacle <b>172</b>. In particular, heat sealing the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> to the manifold <b>190</b> can require more heat, more pressure and more heating time. The semi-rigid or rigid manifold <b>190</b> is appreciably thicker than the individual membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b>. Consequently, relative to the thin membranes, the thicker manifold <b>190</b> acts as a heat sink. The bond between the thin membrane and thicker manifold <b>190</b> therefore requires more heat or energy than the heat seal bond between the thin membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0135">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>4</b>A, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, the disposable unit <b>160</b> requires both membrane to manifold and membrane to membrane seals. It is desirable to heat seal the entire disposable unit <b>160</b> in one step or process for obvious reasons. It should also be obvious that the heat sealing process should be performed so as avoid burning or melting one of the thin membranes <b>162</b> or <b>164</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0136"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates one embodiment for solving the heat sinking disparity between varying materials. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a portion of the manifold <b>190</b>, which is shown in its entirety in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the manifold <b>190</b> illustrates a port that connects to the fluid pump receptacle <b>172</b>. This port is illustrated as port <b>205</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> also illustrates two ports extending from the manifold <b>190</b> that fluidly connect to the fluid heating path <b>180</b>. These ports are illustrated as ports <b>201</b> and <b>203</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Both <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrate that the injection molded manifold <b>190</b> defines a plurality of holes <b>192</b> and slots <b>194</b>. The holes <b>192</b> operate with the valve actuator and the slots <b>194</b> to form fluid pathways when enclosed by the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0137">To reduce the amount of heat necessary to seal the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> to the manifold <b>190</b>, the manifold <b>190</b> includes a side <b>193</b> having a lesser thickness than the remaining portion of the manifold <b>190</b>. The thinner side <b>193</b> has less mass and therefore absorbs less localized heat than would a manifold of constant thickness. The side <b>193</b> also defines or includes a tapered portion <b>195</b>. The tapered portion <b>195</b> provides flat surfaces on which to seal the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> and also positions the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> together so that in an embodiment a membrane to membrane seal may also be made in addition to the membrane to manifold <b>190</b> seal.</p>
  <p num="p-0138">The tapered edges <b>195</b> form an interface for the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> to seal to the manifold <b>190</b>, which occurs along continuous stretches of the sides <b>193</b> of the manifold <b>190</b> that require sealing or that would otherwise come into contact with the medical fluid. Therefore, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the side of the manifold <b>190</b> defining the input/output ports <b>196</b> does not need to be tapered as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Also, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the tapered edges <b>195</b> of the thin sides <b>193</b> discontinue where the ports <b>201</b>, <b>203</b>, and <b>205</b> extend from the manifold <b>190</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0139">The ports <b>201</b>, <b>203</b> and <b>205</b> also form tapered edges <b>207</b>. Tapered edges <b>207</b> form an interface for heat sealing the parts to the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b>. As described above, the tapered edges <b>207</b> of the ports <b>201</b>, <b>203</b> and <b>205</b> also enable a membrane to membrane seal to take place directly next to the membrane to tapered edge <b>207</b> seal. The tapered edges <b>195</b> and <b>207</b> in a preferred embodiment gradually taper towards the knife-like edge. In other embodiments, the tapered edges <b>195</b> and <b>207</b> may take on different forms or shapes, such as a rounded edge, a blunter edge or may simply be further reduced in thickness from side <b>193</b> of the manifold <b>190</b>. As illustrated, the ports <b>201</b>, <b>203</b> and <b>205</b> in an embodiment form ovular openings. The tapered ovular openings provide a smoother transition angle than would a circular outer diameter. The ovular openings perform as well as round openings from a fluid flow standpoint as long as open area of the inner oval is not less than the open area of a suitable circular port.</p>
  <p num="p-0140">The ports <b>201</b>, <b>203</b> and <b>205</b> also form raised portions <b>209</b>. The raised portions <b>209</b> form a bead of polymeric material along the tops of the ports <b>201</b>, <b>203</b> and <b>205</b> and the tapered edges <b>207</b>. The beads can be additionally or alternatively placed along the tapered edges <b>195</b> and or the sides <b>193</b>. The raised portions or beads <b>209</b> provide an extra thin area of plastic that melts or deforms to provide a flux-like sealant that enables the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> to seal to the manifold <b>190</b>. The beads create a concentrated strip of higher temperature plastic than the surrounding plastic of the manifold <b>190</b>. The membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> seal to the manifold <b>190</b> without having to heat a larger area of the manifold <b>190</b>. The raised portions or beads <b>209</b> help to seal curved portions and corners created by the manifold <b>190</b>.</p>
  <heading>D. One-Piece Tip Protector Organizer and Vented Tip Protector</heading> <p num="p-0141">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, one embodiment of a one-piece tip protector organizer <b>270</b> is illustrated. In the HOMECHOICE® peritoneal dialysis system provided by the assignee of the present invention, a disposable set is prepackaged and provided to the patient. The patient opens up the package, wherein each of the components is sterilized and maintained within the disposable set. The disposable set includes a disposable unit and a number of tubes emanating from the disposable unit. Like the present invention, the HOMECHOICE® disposable unit includes a drain line tube that connects to one or more fill bag tubes, and a tube that connects to a patient transfer set. Each of these tubes requires a separate tip protector. That is, after sterilizing the inside of the disposable unit and the tubes, for example, using ethylene oxide, the ends of the tubes have to be capped off so that the sterilization of the inside of the system is maintained. The HOMECHOICE® system provides a separate tip protector for each tube.</p>
  <p num="p-0142">The one-piece tip protector organizer <b>270</b> of the present invention provides a single body <b>272</b> (which may actually be made of a plurality of pieces) that defines or provides a plurality of tip protectors <b>274</b>, <b>276</b>, <b>278</b> and <b>280</b>. The vented tip protector <b>270</b> not only houses and protects the connectors at the ends of the tubes emanating from the disposable unit <b>160</b>, the one-piece tip protector <b>270</b> also organizes and orders the tubes according to the steps of the dialysis therapy. In the illustrated embodiment, the tip protector <b>274</b> is a tip protector for a drain line connector <b>284</b> connected to a drain line <b>285</b> that leads to the appropriate port of the disposable unit <b>160</b>. The tip protectors <b>276</b> and <b>278</b> are supply bag protectors that protect the connectors <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> that connect to the ends of the tubes <b>287</b> and <b>289</b> that run to a “Y” connection <b>287</b>/<b>289</b>, wherein the leg of the “Y” connection <b>287</b>/<b>289</b> runs to the appropriate port of the disposable unit <b>160</b>. The tip protector <b>280</b> is a patient fluid line protector. The tip protector <b>280</b> houses and protects a connector <b>290</b> that connects to patient tube <b>292</b>, which runs to the appropriate port of the disposable unit <b>160</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0143">Each of the tubes <b>285</b>, the “Y” connection <b>287</b> and <b>289</b> and the patient fluid tube <b>292</b> in an embodiment are made of polyvinyichioride (“PVC”) having an inner diameter of 4 mm and an outer diameter of 5 mm. As illustrated, the one-piece tip protector organizer <b>270</b> is adaptable to receive and protect various types of fluid connectors. The fluid connector <b>284</b> that runs via tube <b>285</b> to the drain line port of the disposable unit <b>160</b> is in an embodiment largely the same as the port that emanates from the supply bags <b>14</b>. The ports that emanate from the supply bags <b>14</b> also include a membrane that is pierced by the sharp stem of the supply bag connectors <b>286</b> and <b>288</b>. The drain line connector <b>284</b> does not include the membrane of the supply bag <b>14</b> as it is not needed. The tip protector <b>290</b> that connects to the end of the patient fluid tube <b>292</b> is discussed in detail below.</p>
  <p num="p-0144">In one preferred embodiment, the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> of the present invention provides two, six liter supply bags <b>14</b>. The two, six liter bags provide an economic amount of peritoneal dialysis fluid, which is enough fluid to provide a number of fill, dwell and drain cycles during the evening while the patient sleeps. The one-piece organizer <b>270</b> therefore provides two tip protectors <b>276</b> and <b>278</b>, which house and protect the supply connectors <b>286</b> and <b>288</b>. In alternative embodiments, the one-piece organizer <b>270</b> can define or provide any number of supply bag tip protectors. Any number of supply bags can be additionally linked via “Y” or “T” type tubing links.</p>
  <p num="p-0145">The one-piece organizer <b>270</b> can provide additional tip protectors such as a last bag protector, which protects a line that runs to a bag that holds enough peritoneal fluid, e.g., two liters, for a final fill for the patient during the daytime. In this case, an additional last bag tube, not illustrated, would connect to a connector, which would be a bag piercing connector, the same as or similar to the fill bag connectors <b>286</b> and <b>288</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0146">The body <b>272</b> of the tip protector organizer <b>270</b> is in an embodiment also made of PVC. The tip protectors <b>274</b>, <b>276</b>, <b>278</b> and <b>280</b> are injection molded or blow molded. Alternatively, the tip protectors can be separately applied to the body <b>272</b>. As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, one or more of the tip protectors can include flutes, threads or other protrusions that aid in grasping and holding the respective tube connector. Further, while the organizer <b>270</b> is generally referred to herein as a “one-piece” organizer, the organizer <b>270</b> may itself be comprised of any number or pieces. “One-piece” refers to the feature that a single unit houses a multitude or tip protectors.</p>
  <p num="p-0147">The one-piece organizer <b>270</b> also includes a rim <b>294</b> that extends outwardly from the main portion of the body <b>272</b>, and which circumvents the main portion of the body <b>272</b>. Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a cross section of the one-piece organizer <b>270</b> illustrates that the rim <b>294</b> tapers downwardly from the drain line tip protector <b>274</b> towards the patient fluid tip protector <b>280</b>. That is, the rim <b>294</b> is higher or thicker at the drain line end than it is at the patient fluid line end. This enables the one-piece tip protector organizer <b>270</b> to be mounted to the hardware unit <b>110</b> in only one orientation.</p>
  <p num="p-0148"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates that the one-piece tip protector organizer <b>270</b> in an embodiment slides into the hardware unit <b>110</b> vertically. The hardware unit <b>110</b> includes or provides a pair of members <b>296</b> that extend outwardly from a side wall of the hardware unit <b>110</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 4A</figref> illustrate another embodiment, wherein the rim <b>294</b> of the organizer <b>270</b> slides vertically into a notch <b>297</b> defined or provided by the base <b>114</b> of the housing <b>112</b> of the hardware unit <b>110</b>. The rim <b>294</b> of the organizer <b>270</b> slides between the members <b>296</b> and the side wall of the hardware unit <b>110</b>. The members <b>296</b> extend further outwardly as they extend running towards the top of the hardware unit <b>110</b>. The taper of the members <b>296</b> corresponds to the taper of the rim <b>294</b> of the organizer <b>270</b> so that the organizer <b>270</b> can only slide into the hardware unit <b>110</b> vertically from one direction.</p>
  <p num="p-0149"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> also illustrates that the tip protectors <b>274</b>, <b>276</b>, <b>278</b> and <b>280</b> can have various cross-sectional shapes. Each of the tip protectors includes a solid bottom and sides that seal around the respective connectors <b>284</b>, <b>286</b>, <b>288</b> and <b>290</b>, so that the one-piece organizer <b>270</b> maintains the sterility of the system even after the patient removes the disposable set from a sealed sterilized container. The one-piece organizer <b>270</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> mounts in a sturdy fashion to the side of the hardware unit <b>110</b>. Via this solid connection, the patient is able to remove the tubes <b>285</b>, <b>287</b>, <b>289</b> and <b>292</b> using only one hand in many cases. The interface between the hardware unit <b>110</b> and the organizer <b>270</b> simplifies the procedure for the patient and provides a solid, sterile environment for the tubes and associated connectors until used.</p>
  <p num="p-0150"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> also illustrates another possible embodiment wherein an alternative one-piece organizer <b>298</b> is integral to or provided by the frame <b>186</b> of the disposable unit <b>160</b>. Here, the tubes <b>196</b>, indicated generally, are horizontally organized as opposed to the vertical arrangement of the tip protector <b>270</b> in the housing <b>112</b>. The horizontal one-piece organizer <b>298</b> illustrates that the concept of protecting and organizing the tubes before use can be provided in a variety of places and orientations in the system <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0151">In one embodiment, the tip protector and organizer <b>270</b> structures the tubes <b>285</b>, <b>287</b>, <b>289</b> and <b>292</b> in a downwardly vertical order, such that the first tube that the patient is supposed to pull when starting the dialysis therapy is provided on top, the next tubes that the patient is supposed to pull are provided in the middle and the final tube is provided lowest on the vertically oriented one-piece organizer <b>270</b>. According to one preferred protocol, the patient first removes the drain connector <b>284</b> from the tip protector <b>274</b> and runs the drain line <b>285</b> to a toilet, drain bag or other drain. The patient then removes the supply connectors <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> and punctures the supply bags <b>14</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>). At this point, dialysate can be pumped to the disposable unit <b>160</b> and throughout the system <b>10</b>. The controller <b>30</b> of the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> begins a priming cycle, which is discussed in more detail below.</p>
  <p num="p-0152">Once priming is complete, system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> prompts the patient to remove the primed patient line <b>292</b> and connect same to the transfer set implanted into the patient. The transfer set (not illustrated) includes a catheter positioned into the patient's peritoneal cavity and a tube running to the catheter. The tube also includes a connector that couples to the connector <b>290</b>. At this point, system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> can begin to either drain spent peritoneal fluid from the patient <b>12</b> to the drain <b>18</b> or pull new fluid from one or both of the supply bags <b>14</b> and fill the patient's peritoneal cavity <b>12</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0153">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 12</figref>, one embodiment for the patient line tip protector <b>280</b> of the present invention is illustrated. The HOMECHOICE® system produced by the assignee of the present invention primes the patient fluid line by allowing the patient connector to be held vertically approximately at the same level as the supply bag. In this manner, when the HOMECHOICE® system primes the disposable unit, gravity feeds peritoneal fluid into the patient fluid line up to the end of the patient fluid connector. The patient fluid connector is open so that air can freely escape when the peritoneal fluid is fed by gravity through the patient line. HOMECHOICE® system enables the patient fluid line to be primed without counting pump strokes or having to meter out a known volume of dialysate, techniques which are complicated and prone to failure.</p>
  <p num="p-0154">The system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> of the present invention provides a different apparatus and method of priming without having to calculate the amount of fluid that is needed to just reach but not surpass the patient connector of the patient fluid line. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a cross-section of the patient fluid connector <b>290</b> that has been inserted into the vented tip protector <b>280</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates a cross section of the patient fluid connector <b>290</b> only. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates a cross section of the tip protector <b>280</b> only. A hydrophobic membrane <b>300</b> is placed on the outer edge of the tip protector <b>280</b>. The tip protector <b>280</b> defines a fluid lumen <b>302</b> that runs through the entire length of the tip protector <b>280</b>. The hydrophobic membrane <b>300</b> covers the fluid lumen <b>302</b>. The hydrophobic membrane <b>300</b> allows air to purge from inside the patient's fluid line but does not allow water or peritoneal fluid to flow through same.</p>
  <p num="p-0155">It should be appreciated that the vented tip protector <b>280</b> including the hydrophobic membrane <b>300</b> is not limited to being placed in the one-piece tip protector organizer <b>270</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates that the one-piece organizer <b>270</b> does include the patient tip protector <b>280</b> having the hydrophobic membrane <b>300</b> and the fluid lumen <b>302</b>. The vented tip protector <b>280</b> in an alternative embodiment, however, can be provided as a separate or stand alone tip protector, similar to the one used on the HOMECHOICE® system provided by the assignee of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0156">Hydrophobic membranes, such as the hydrophobic membrane <b>300</b> employed herein, are commercially available. One suitable hydrophobic membrane is produced by Millipore, 80 Ashby Road, Bedford, Mass. 01730. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> best illustrates that the hydrophobic membrane heat seals or sonically seals to the tip protector <b>280</b>. The fluid lumen <b>302</b> in an embodiment is relatively small in diameter, such as approximately fifty to seventy thousandths of an inch (1.25 to 1.75 mm).</p>
  <p num="p-0157">The vented tip protector <b>280</b> and the patient fluid connector <b>290</b> also cooperate so that when the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> is completely primed, the tip protector <b>280</b> and connector <b>290</b> minimize the amount of fluid that spills when the patient removes the patient fluid connector <b>290</b> from the tip protector <b>280</b>. The connector <b>290</b> includes or provides a male lure <b>304</b> that mates with a female lure <b>306</b> best seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The mating lures <b>304</b> and <b>306</b> prevent peritoneal fluid from filling the cavity of the tip protector <b>280</b>, which must be wide enough to house the flange <b>308</b> of the patient fluid connector <b>290</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates that the seal interface between the male lure <b>304</b> of the connector <b>290</b> and the female lure <b>306</b> of the vented tip protector <b>280</b> reduces the volume significantly from an interior volume <b>310</b> existing around the male lure <b>304</b> to the fifty to seventy thousandths diameter of the lumen <b>302</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0158">To prime the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> the patient removes the drain line <b>285</b> from the tip protector <b>274</b> and places it into a tub, toilet or drain bag <b>18</b>. The patient removes the two or more supply bag connectors <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> and punctures seal membranes (not illustrated) of the supply bags <b>14</b>. System <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> may then automatically begin pump priming or may begin pump priming upon a patient input. In either case, system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> pumps fluid from one or both of the supply bags <b>14</b> through the connectors <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> and tubes <b>287</b> and <b>289</b>, into the disposal disposable unit <b>160</b>, out the patient fluid line <b>292</b> and into the patient fluid connector <b>290</b>, which is still housed in the vented tip protector <b>280</b> of the one-piece organizer <b>270</b>. The organizer <b>270</b> is vertically housed in the hardware unit <b>110</b> as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0159">When the peritoneal fluid reaches the patient fluid connector <b>290</b>, most all the air within the system <b>10</b> has been pushed through the hydrophobic membrane <b>300</b> attached at the end of the tip protector <b>280</b> housed in the one-piece tip protector <b>270</b>. The nature of the hydrophobic membrane <b>300</b> is that it allows air to pass through but filters or does not allow water or peritoneal fluid to pass through same. Thus, when the fluid finally reaches the hydrophobic membrane <b>300</b>, the lack of any additional space in which to flow fluid causes the pressure to increase within the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b>. The system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> provides one or more pressure sensors, for example pressure sensors <b>68</b> (marked as FP<b>1</b>, FP<b>2</b> and FPT in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>).</p>
  <p num="p-0160">One or more of the pressure sensors <b>68</b> sense the increase in pressure due to the peritoneal fluid backing up against the hydrophobic filter <b>300</b>. The pressure sensor(s) sends a signal to the I/O module <b>36</b> of the controller <b>30</b>. The controller <b>30</b> receives the signal and is programmed in memory device <b>32</b> to shut down the diaphragm pump <b>20</b>, <b>120</b>. In this manner, the system <b>10</b> self-primes each of the fill lines <b>287</b> and <b>289</b>, the disposable unit <b>160</b> and the patient fluid line <b>292</b> automatically and without need for controlled volume calculations or gravity feeding.</p>
  <p num="p-0161">System <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> also includes one or more safety features that may be based upon a volume calculation. That is, under normal operations, the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> does not control the priming using a volume calculation. However, in the case where for example the patient removes the patient fluid connector <b>290</b> from the vented tip protector <b>280</b> of the one-piece tip organizer <b>270</b> before the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> senses a pressure increase and stops the pumps <b>10</b>, <b>100</b>, the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> can employ an alarm calculation, wherein the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> knows that it has pumped too much peritoneal fluid (e.g., a predetermined amount more than the internal volume of the system) and shuts down pump <b>20</b>, <b>120</b> accordingly.</p>
  <heading>III. Membrane Material for the Disposable Unit</heading> <p num="p-0162">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, upper and lower membranes <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> can be fabricated from a monolayer film structure <b>312</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) or a multiple layer film structure <b>312</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). The film <b>312</b> is constructed from a non-PVC containing polymeric material and must satisfy numerous physical property requirements. The film <b>312</b> must have a low modulus of elasticity so that it can be deformed under low pressure to function as a pumping element. What is meant by low modulus is the film <b>312</b> has a modulus of elasticity when measured in accordance with ASTM D882, of less than about 10,000 psi, more preferably less than about 8,000 psi and even more preferably less than about 5,000 psi and finally, less than about 3,000 psi, or any range or combination of ranges defined by these numbers. The film <b>312</b> must have adequate thermal conductivity to allow for in-line heating. The film has a thermal conductivity of greater than 0.13 W/meters-°K when measured using a Hot Disk™ sold by Mathis Instruments Ltd. The film <b>312</b> must be capable of being heat sealed to cassette <b>160</b>. The film <b>312</b> must be capable of being sterilized by exposure to gamma rays, by exposure to steam for a period of time (typically 1 hour), and exposure to ethylene oxide without significant degradation of the film or having an adverse effect on the dialysis solution. Finally, the film <b>312</b> must be capable of being extruded at high rates of speed of greater than 50 ft/min.</p>
  <p num="p-0163">The monolayer structure <b>312</b> is formed from a blend of from about 90% to about 99% by weight of a first component containing a styrene and hydrocarbon copolymer and from about 10% to about 1% of a melt strength enhancing polymer and more preferably a high melt strength polypropylene.</p>
  <p num="p-0164">The term “styrene” includes styrene and the various substituted styrenes including alkyl substituted styrene and halogen substituted styrene. The alkyl group can contain from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms.

  <p num="p-0167">The selective hydrogenation of the above block copolymers may be carried out by a variety of well known processes including hydrogenation in the presence of such catalysts as Raney nickel, noble metals such as platinum, palladium, etc., and soluble transition metal catalysts. Suitable hydrogenation processes which can be used are those wherein the diene-containing polymer or copolymer is dissolved in an inert hydrocarbon diluent such as cyclohexane and hydrogenated by reaction with hydrogen in the presence of a soluble hydrogenation catalyst. Such procedures are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,113,986 and 4,226,952, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof.</p>
  <p num="p-0168">Particularly useful hydrogenated block copolymers are the hydrogenated block copolymers of styrene-isoprene-styrene, such as a polystyrene-(ethylene/propylene)-polystyrene block polymer. When a polystyrene-polybutadiene-polystyrene block copolymer is hydrogenated, the resulting product resembles a regular copolymer block of ethylene and 1-butene (EB). This hydrogenated block copolymer is often referred to as SEBS. When the conjugated diene employed is isoprene, the resulting hydrogenated product resembles a regular copolymer block of ethylene and propylene (EP). This hydrogenated block copolymer is often referred to as SEPS. When the conjugated diene is a mixture of isoprene and butadiene the selectively hydrogenated product is referred to as SEEPS. Suitable SEBS, SEPS and SEEPS copolymers are sold by Shell Oil under the tradename KRATON, by Kurary under the tradename SEPTON® and HYBRAR®.</p>
  <p num="p-0169">The block copolymers of the conjugated diene and the vinyl aromatic compound can be grafted with an alpha,beta-unsaturated monocarboxylic or dicarboxylic acid reagent. The carboxylic acid reagents include carboxylic acids per se and their functional derivatives such as anhydrides, imides, metal salts, esters, etc., which are capable of being grafted onto the selectively hydrogenated block copolymer. The grafted polymer will usually contain from about 0.1 to about 20%, and preferably from about 0.1 to about 10% by weight based on the total weight of the block copolymer and the carboxylic acid reagent of the grafted carboxylic acid.

The amount of oil added to the styrene and hydrocarbon block copolymer is from about 5% to about 40%. The first component can also contain a polypropylene up to about 20% by weight of the first component. One particularly suitable first component is an oil modified SEBS sold by the Shell Chemical Company under the product designation KRATON G2705.</p>
  <p num="p-0171">The melt strength enhancing polymer preferably is a high melt strength polypropylene. Suitable high melt strength polypropylenes can be a homopolymer or a copolyrner of polypropylene and can have free end long chain branching or not. In one preferred form of the invention, the high melt strength polypropylene will have a melt flow index within the range of 10 grams/10 min. to 800 grams/10 min., more preferably 10 grams/10 min. to 200 grams/10 min, or any range or combination of ranges therein. High melt strength polypropylenes are known to have free-end long chain branches of propylene units. Methods of preparing polypropylenes which exhibit a high melt strength characteristic have been described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,916,198; 5,047,485; and 5,605,936, which are incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof. One such method includes irradiating a linear propylene polymer in an environment in which the active oxygen concentration is about 15% by volume with high energy ionization radiation at a dose of 1×10<sup>4 </sup>megarads per minute for a period of time sufficient for a substantial amount of chain scission of the linear propylene polymer to occur but insufficient to cause the material to become gelatinous. The irradiation results in chain scission. The subsequent recombination of chain fragments results in the formation of new chains, as well as joining chain fragments to chains to form branches. This further results in the desired free-end long chain branched, high molecular weight, non-linear, propylene polymer material. Radiation is maintained until a significant amount of long chain branches form. The material is then treated to deactivate substantially all the free radicals present in the irradiated material.</p>
  <p num="p-0172">High melt strength polypropylenes can also be obtained as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,416,169, which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference and made a part hereof, when a specified organic peroxide (di-2-ethylhexyl peroxydicarbonate) is reacted with a polypropylene under specified conditions, followed by melt-kneading. Such polypropylenes are linear, crystalline polypropylenes having a branching coefficient of substantially 1, and, therefore, has no free ende long-chain branching and will have a intrinsic viscosity of from about 2.5 dl/g to 10 dl/g.</p>

  <p num="p-0178">It is also possible to use a blend of polypropylene and α-olefin copolymers wherein the propylene copolymers can vary by the number of carbons in the α-olefin. For example, the present invention contemplates blends of propylene and α-olefin copolymers wherein one copolymer has a 2 carbon α-olefin and another copolymer has a 4 carbon α-olefin. It is also possible to use any combination of α-olefins from 2 to 20 carbons and more preferably from 2 to 8 carbons. Accordingly, the present invention contemplates blends of propylene and α-olefin copolymers wherein a first and second α-olefins have the following combination of carbon numbers: 2 and 6, 2 and 8, 4 and 6, 4 and 8. It is also contemplated using more than 2 polypropylene and α-olefin copolymers in the blend. Suitable polymers can be obtained using a catalloy procedure.</p>

Single site catalysts are believed to have a single, sterically and electronically equivalent catalyst position as opposed to the Ziegler-Natta type catalysts which are known to have a mixture of catalysts sites. Such single-site catalyzed ethylene α-olefins are sold by Dow under the trade name AFFINITY, DuPont Dow under the trademark ENGAGE® and by Exxon under the trade name EXACT.

What is meant by adhesive compatibility is the membrane can be attached to the cassette using standard heat sealing techniques. One particularly suitable material is a polymer blend of a polyolefin and a styrene and hydrocarbon copolymer.

  <heading>IV. Valve Actuator</heading> <p num="p-0193">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, one embodiment of an interface between the valve actuator <b>26</b> and the valve manifold <b>190</b> is illustrated. The valve motor <b>28</b> (not illustrated) of the valve actuator <b>26</b> drives a camshaft <b>200</b> through a mechanical linkage determinable to those of skill in the art. In an embodiment, a single camshaft <b>200</b> attaches to a series of cams <b>202</b>, for example, one of each of the valves in the system <b>10</b> or <b>100</b>. The cams <b>202</b> are fixed to the camshaft <b>200</b> and rotate in a one to one relationship with same.</p>
  <p num="p-0194">The cams <b>202</b> drive pistons <b>204</b>, which engage in a friction reduced way with the cams, for example, via rollers <b>206</b>. The cams <b>202</b> drive pistons <b>204</b> up and down (only two of five cams shown having associated pistons to show other features of the actuator <b>26</b>). When a cam <b>202</b> drives its associated piston <b>204</b> upward, the piston <b>204</b> engages one of the membranes <b>162</b> or <b>164</b> (typically the lower membrane <b>164</b>, which is not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> for clarity) and pushes the membrane up into the respective hole <b>192</b> defined by the rigid manifold <b>190</b>. This action stops the flow of medical fluid or dialysate through the respective valve.</p>
  <p num="p-0195">The pistons <b>204</b> are also spring-loaded inside a respective housing <b>208</b>. When the camshaft <b>200</b> turns so that a lower cam profile appears below one of the pistons <b>204</b>, the spring inside the housing <b>208</b> pushes the piston <b>204</b> so that the roller <b>206</b> maintains contact with the respective cam <b>202</b>. The piston <b>204</b> consequently moves away from the respective hole <b>192</b> defined by the rigid manifold <b>190</b>, wherein the membrane <b>162</b> or <b>164</b>, which has been stretched upward by the piston <b>204</b>, springs back to its normal shape. This action starts the flow of medical fluid or dialysate through the respective valve.</p>
  <p num="p-0196">The motor <b>28</b> is of a type, for example a stepper or servo motor, that can rotate a fraction of a rotation and stop and dwell for any predetermined period of time. Thus, the motor <b>28</b> can hold a valve open or closed for as long as necessary. The cams <b>202</b> are shaped to provide a unique combination of bumps and valleys for every flow situation. In certain situations, such as with valves V<b>2</b> and V<b>3</b> of the system <b>10</b>, the valves always open and close together, so that both valves use the same cam <b>202</b> oriented in the same way on camshaft <b>200</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0197">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref>, the camshaft <b>200</b> and cams <b>202</b> are illustrated figuratively. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> illustrates a composite cam profile <b>370</b>, i.e., a combination of each of the cams <b>202</b> <i>a </i>to <b>202</b> <i>f </i>illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> illustrates that the cams <b>202</b> <i>a </i>to <b>202</b> <i>f </i>mount to the camshaft <b>200</b> via hubs <b>384</b>. The hubs <b>384</b> may employ set screens as is well known. camshaft <b>200</b> can also have indentations, etc., for aligning the hubs <b>384</b>. In an alternative embodiment, one or more of the cams <b>202</b> <i>a </i>to <b>202</b> <i>f </i>may be integrally formed with the otherwise camshaft <b>200</b>. In an embodiment, the camshaft <b>200</b> is a single molded piece, which prevents the cams <b>202</b> <i>a </i>to <b>202</b> <i>f </i>from rotating with respect to one another. The single molded camshaft <b>200</b> supports or attaches to a plurality of or to all of the cams <b>202</b> <i>a </i>to <b>202</b> <i>f. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0198">As illustrated above in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, each of the cams <b>202</b> <i>a </i>to <b>202</b> <i>f </i>of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> drives a single piston <b>204</b> and roller <b>206</b> to operate a single valve head <b>192</b> of the rigid manifold <b>190</b>. The cams <b>202</b> <i>a </i>to <b>202</b> <i>f </i>open or occlude the valve heads <b>192</b> according to the shape of the respective cam. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> illustrates that the camshaft <b>200</b> supports six cams <b>202</b> <i>a </i>to <b>202</b> <i>f</i>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates five cams <b>200</b>. The cam provided in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> may be to open a last bag, illustrated by the “last bag valve open” position <b>382</b>. Either of the systems <b>10</b> or <b>100</b> may include a last bag. The last bag is a final dialysate fill of about two liters into the patient before the patient disconnects from the system and resumes normal daily activities.</p>
  <p num="p-0199">The valve motor <b>28</b> and the valve actuator <b>26</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) rotate the camshaft <b>200</b> to open or close the valve heads <b>192</b> to create a desired solution flow path. The arrangement of the cams <b>202</b> <i>a </i>to <b>202</b> <i>f </i>on the camshaft <b>200</b> is made such that, at any time during the therapy, there is no more than one fluid path open at any given time. Further, when the valve actuator <b>26</b> rotates the camshaft <b>200</b> from one flow path open position to the next, the series of cams <b>202</b> <i>a </i>to <b>202</b> <i>f </i>close all the valves for a moment of time. The closing of each of the valves prevents dialysate from back-flowing or moving in the wrong direction. Still further, the cams <b>202</b> <i>a </i>to <b>202</b> <i>f </i>are arranged such that only one valve head <b>192</b> of the valve manifold <b>190</b> of the disposable unit <b>160</b> may be open at any given time. Therefore, there is no open fluid path in the event of a system failure or inadvertent power down. This safety feature prevents dialysate from free-flowing into the patient <b>12</b> or overfilling the patient <b>12</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0200">The lid <b>116</b> for the housing <b>112</b> of the hardware unit <b>110</b> may be freely opened by an operator or patient to load the disposable unit <b>160</b> into the hardware unit. When this occurs, the controller <b>30</b> automatically commands the camshaft to rotate so that an “all valves open” position <b>372</b>, illustrated by the composite profile <b>370</b>, resides beneath the rollers <b>206</b> and pistons <b>204</b>. In the “all valves open” position <b>372</b>, the camshaft <b>200</b> is rotated such that a depression exists under each of the pistons <b>204</b> and associated rollers <b>206</b>. Accordingly, the pistons <b>204</b> sit in a relatively low position, i.e., out of the way, when the operator or patient loads the disposable unit <b>160</b> and valve manifold <b>190</b> into the hardware unit <b>110</b>. This enables the patient or operator to place a disposable unit <b>160</b> into the unit <b>110</b> without encountering an obstruction or opposing force by one or more of the pistons <b>206</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0201">After the patient or operator loads the disposable unit into the hardware unit <b>110</b> and closes the lid <b>116</b>, the controller <b>30</b> automatically rotates the camshaft <b>200</b> so that an “all valves closed” position <b>386</b> <i>a </i>resides beneath the pistons <b>204</b> and rollers <b>206</b>. As illustrated, the “all valves closed” position <b>386</b> <i>a </i>resides adjacent to the “all valves open” position <b>372</b>. When the camshaft <b>200</b> is rotated to the “all valves closed position” <b>386</b> <i>a</i>, no fluid can flow through the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b>. As the camshaft <b>200</b> rotates from the “all valves open” position <b>372</b> to the first “all valves closed” position <b>386</b> <i>a</i>, a mechanical interlock (not illustrated) is moved into the camshaft <b>200</b>, which prevents the rotation of the camshaft <b>200</b> back to the “all valves open” position <b>372</b>. This prevents uncontrolled flow of the dialysate, which could occur when each of the valve heads <b>192</b> is open, in the event that the operator tries to open the lid <b>116</b> during therapy.</p>
  <p num="p-0202">In an alternative embodiment, an interlock can be provided through software. An encoder provides positional and velocity feedback to the controller <b>30</b>. The controller <b>30</b> therefore knows the position of the cam shaft <b>200</b>. Thus, the controller <b>30</b> is able to prevent the rotation of the camshaft <b>200</b> back to the “all valves open” position <b>372</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0203">When the patient closes lid <b>116</b>, a second mechanical interlock (not illustrated) locks the lid in place, so that the patient cannot open the lid <b>116</b> during therapy. The system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> senses when the patient has removed the patient fluid line <b>292</b> and connector <b>290</b> from the transfer set, which is implanted in the patient <b>12</b>. Only then will the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> allow the patient to open the lid <b>116</b>. The mechanical interlocks prevent free-filling, overfilling and the patient from tampering with the system while it is running. The valve configuration provides a fail safe system that prevents fluid flow in the event of a failure or power down.</p>
  <p num="p-0204">In many instances, when the patient begins dialysis therapy, the patient is already full of dialysate. In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>, therefore, the composite profile <b>370</b> provides the “all valve open” position <b>372</b> next to the “from patient value open” position <b>374</b>. The “from patient valve open” position resides next to the “drain valve open” position <b>376</b>. In this manner, upon therapy startup, camshaft <b>200</b> is readily positioned to be able to cooperate with the pump <b>20</b>, <b>120</b> to drain spent dialysate from the patient. It should be appreciated that any of the cams <b>202</b> <i>a </i>to <b>202</b> <i>f </i>may be the cam that provides the “from patient valve open” position <b>374</b>, the “drain valve open” position <b>376</b>, etc.</p>
  <p num="p-0205">Between the “from patient valve open” position <b>374</b> and the “drain valve open” position <b>376</b> resides a second “all valves closed” position <b>386</b> <i>b</i>. Between each opening of a new valve and closing of a previously opened valve, each valve is momentarily closed. The controller <b>30</b> causes the motor (e.g., a stepper, servo or DC motor) and actuator <b>26</b> to toggle the camshaft <b>200</b> back and forth between the “from patent valve open” position <b>374</b>, past the “all valves closed” position <b>386</b> <i>b</i>, to the “drain valve open” position <b>376</b>. In this manner, the pump <b>20</b>, <b>120</b> is able to sequentially pull apart fluid from the patient <b>12</b> and dump it to drain <b>18</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0206">When the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> completes the initial patient drain cycle, the controller <b>30</b> causes the actuator <b>26</b> of motor <b>28</b> to rotate camshaft <b>200</b> past the “all valves closed” position <b>386</b> <i>c </i>to the “supply valve open position” <b>378</b>. To fill the patient full of fresh dialysate, the controller <b>30</b> causes the camshaft <b>200</b> to toggle back and forth between the “supply valve open” position <b>378</b> and the “to patient valve open” position <b>380</b>, each time passing over the “all valves closed” position <b>386</b> <i>d</i>. Again, for the drain and fill cycles, only one valve head <b>192</b> is open at any given period of time. The toggling always includes an “all valves closed” position between the dosing of one valve head <b>192</b> and the opening of another. The single pump sequentially pulls fluid into the disposable unit <b>160</b> and pushes fluid from same.</p>
  <p num="p-0207">After the initial fill, camshaft <b>200</b> is positioned so that the camshaft <b>200</b> can once again toggle back and forth between the “from patient valve open” position <b>374</b>, past the intermediate “all valves closed” position <b>386</b> <i>b</i>, to the “drain valve open” position <b>376</b>. When the patient is once again empty, the camshaft <b>200</b> is positioned so that the camshaft may be toggled back and forth between the “supply valve open” position <b>378</b> and the “to patient valve open” position <b>380</b>. The system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> repeats this series of cycles as many times as necessary. Typically, the patient receives approximately 2 to 2.5 liters of dialysate in a single fill cycle. The two supply bags <b>14</b> each hold six liters of dialysate in an embodiment. This provides the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> with four to six complete fill, dwell and drain cycles, which are provided, for example, through the night while the patient sleeps.</p>
  <p num="p-0208">In many instances, the patient will receive a last bag fill at the end of the therapy, which the patient will carry for the day. To perform this procedure, the camshaft <b>200</b> toggles back and forth between the “from patient valve open” position <b>374</b> to the “drain valve open” position <b>376</b> to dump the preceding fill of peritoneal fluid to drain <b>18</b>. Thereafter, the camshaft <b>200</b> is positioned to toggle back and forth between the “last bag valve open” position <b>382</b> and the “to patient valve open” position <b>380</b>. In doing so, the camshaft <b>200</b> rotates past one of the all valves closed positions, namely, the “all valves closed position” <b>386</b> <i>e. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0209">To prime the system, the camshaft <b>200</b> may be positioned and toggled in a number of different ways. In one embodiment, the camshaft <b>200</b> toggles back and forth between the “supply valve open” position <b>378</b> and the “drain valve open” position <b>376</b>, passing over the “all valves closed” position <b>386</b> <i>c</i>. This toggling in cooperation with the pumping of pump <b>20</b> or <b>120</b> causes the dialysate to flow from the supply bags <b>14</b>, through the disposable unit <b>160</b>, to drain <b>18</b>. In another embodiment, using the vented tip protector <b>280</b> illustrated in connection with the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 12</figref>, the camshaft <b>200</b> toggles back and forth between the “supply valve open” position <b>378</b> and the “to patient valve open” position <b>380</b>. This causes dialysate to flow from the bags <b>14</b>, through the disposable unit <b>160</b>, and into the patient fluid line <b>292</b> to the end of the vented tip protector <b>280</b>. When dialysate reaches the hydrophobic membrane <b>300</b> of the vented tip protection <b>28</b>, the pressure in the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> rises, wherein a signal is received by the controller <b>30</b>, which causes the pump <b>20</b>, <b>120</b> to stop pumping and the camshaft <b>200</b> to stop toggling.</p>
  <heading>V. Medical Fluid Pump</heading> <heading>A. Pump Hardware and Operation</heading> <p num="p-0210">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>, one embodiment of the pump <b>20</b> is illustrated. The lid <b>116</b> of the hardware unit <b>110</b> defines an upper chamber wall <b>216</b>. Disposed within the housing <b>112</b> of the hardware unit <b>110</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 4B</figref>) is a lower chamber wall <b>218</b>. The chamber walls <b>216</b> and <b>218</b> define an internal chamber <b>210</b>. The chamber <b>210</b> can have any desired shape, for instance the clamshell shape as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0211">The lower chamber wall <b>218</b> defines or provides a sealed aperture <b>219</b> that allows a pump piston <b>212</b> to translate back and forth within the chamber <b>210</b>. The piston <b>212</b> is attached to or integrally formed with a piston head <b>214</b>. The piston head <b>214</b> in an embodiment has an outer shape that is similar to or the same as an internal shape of the upper chamber wall <b>216</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0212">The pump piston <b>212</b> connects to or is integrally formed with the linear actuator <b>24</b>. The linear actuator <b>24</b> in an embodiment is a device, such as a ball screw, that converts the rotary motion of a motor <b>22</b> into the translational motion of the piston <b>212</b>. In one preferred embodiment, the motor <b>22</b> is a linear stepper motor that outputs a translationally moving shaft. Here, the actuator <b>24</b> may simply couple the motor shaft to the piston <b>212</b>. The linear or rotary stepper motor provides quiet linear motion and a very high positional resolution, accuracy and repeatability. Stepper motors are commercially available, for example, from Hayden Switch and Instrument Inc., Waterbury, Conn.</p>
  <p num="p-0213">As described above, the flexible fluid receptacle <b>172</b> (seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> but not in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>) is defined by the expandable upper and lower membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b>, respectively, of the disposable unit <b>160</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>, when the pump <b>20</b> is full of medical fluid, the pump chamber <b>210</b> and the membrane receptacle <b>172</b> have substantially the same shape. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>, when the pump <b>20</b> has displaced all or most all of the medical fluid, the pump chamber <b>210</b> maintains the same volume but the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> of the fluid receptacle <b>172</b> have collapsed to virtually a zero volume along the interior surface of the upper chamber wall <b>216</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0214">Vacuum source <b>44</b> for the pump <b>20</b> is described above in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The vacuum source <b>44</b> exerts a vacuum on the upper membrane <b>162</b>, through the aperture or port <b>222</b>. The aperture or port <b>222</b> extends through the upper chamber wall <b>216</b>. The vacuum source <b>44</b> exerts a vacuum on the lower membrane <b>164</b>, through an aperture <b>221</b> defined or provided by housing <b>223</b>, and through the port or aperture <b>220</b>. The port or aperture <b>220</b> extends through the piston <b>212</b>, including the piston head <b>214</b>. When a vacuum is applied, the lower membrane <b>164</b> seals against the piston head <b>214</b>. The upper membrane <b>162</b> seals against the upper chamber wall <b>216</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0215">The port <b>222</b> fluidly connects to channels (not illustrated) defined by the interior wall of the upper chamber wall <b>216</b>. The channels extend radially outwardly from port <b>222</b> in various directions. The channels help to distribute the negative pressure applied through the port <b>222</b> to further enable the upper membrane <b>162</b> to substantially conform to the interior shape of the upper chamber wall <b>216</b>. In a similar manner, the outer surface of the piston head <b>214</b> can include radially extending channels to further enable the lower membrane <b>164</b> to substantially conform, upon application of the vacuum, to the outer surface of the piston head <b>214</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0216">The pump <b>20</b> also includes a diaphragm <b>232</b> tensioned between the upper and lower chamber walls <b>216</b> and <b>218</b>, respectively. The diaphragm <b>232</b> defines, together with the upper chamber wall <b>218</b>, a known, predictable and repeatable maximum volume of dialysate, which can be drawn from one or more of the supply bags <b>14</b> and transported to the patient <b>12</b>. The diaphragm <b>232</b> also enables the volume of a partial stroke to be characterized, which also enables accurate and repeatable volume measurements.</p>
  <p num="p-0217">The diaphragm <b>232</b> is disposed beneath the piston head <b>214</b> and around the piston <b>212</b>. When the vacuum is applied to the port or aperture <b>220</b>, the diaphragm <b>232</b>, as well as the lower membrane <b>164</b>, are pulled against the piston head <b>214</b>. When the piston head <b>214</b> is actuated upwardly away from the lower chamber wall <b>218</b>, with the vacuum applied through aperture <b>220</b>, the membrane <b>164</b> and the diaphragm <b>232</b> remain drawn to the piston head <b>214</b>. An inner portion of the membrane <b>164</b> conforms to the shape of the outer surface of the piston head <b>214</b>. The remaining outer portion of the membrane <b>164</b> conforms to the shape of the exposed surface of the diaphragm <b>232</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0218">The diaphragm <b>232</b> in an embodiment includes a flexible, molded cup-shaped elastomer and a fabric reinforcement, such as fabric reinforced ethylene propylene diene methylene (“EPDM”). The fabric can be integrally molded with the elastomer. The fabric prevents unwanted deformation of the diaphragm while under pressure. The diaphragm <b>232</b> can stretch when the piston <b>212</b> and head <b>214</b> move downwardly towards the lower chamber wall <b>218</b>, pulling the diaphragm <b>232</b> along the crimped edges of the upper and lower chamber walls <b>216</b> and <b>218</b>. The diaphragm <b>232</b> also moves and remains sealed to the piston head <b>214</b> when the piston <b>212</b> and head <b>214</b> move upwardly towards the upper chamber wall <b>216</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0219">In operating the pump <b>20</b>, negative pressure is constantly applied through the port <b>222</b> to hold the upper membrane <b>162</b> against the upper chamber wall <b>216</b>. The manifold <b>190</b> of the disposable unit <b>160</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 5</figref>) define a fluid port opening <b>230</b> to the membrane receptacle <b>172</b>. The fluid port opening <b>230</b> allows medical fluid or dialysate to enter and exit the membrane receptacle <b>172</b>. The membrane receptacle <b>172</b> seats in place with the crimped edges of the upper and lower chamber walls <b>216</b> and <b>218</b>. The seal <b>170</b> of the receptacle <b>172</b> may actually reside slightly inside the crimped edges of the upper and lower chamber walls <b>216</b> and <b>218</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>).</p>
  <p num="p-0220">During a pump fill stroke, with the upper membrane <b>162</b> vacuum-pressed against the upper chamber wall <b>216</b>, and the lower membrane <b>164</b> and the diaphragm <b>232</b> vacuum-pressed against the piston head <b>214</b>, the motor <b>22</b>/actuator <b>24</b> cause the piston head <b>214</b> to move downwardly towards the lower chamber wall <b>218</b>, increasing the volume within the flexible receptacle <b>172</b>, and producing a negative pressure within same. The negative pressure pulls dialysate from the supply bags <b>14</b> or the patient <b>12</b> as dictated by the current valve arrangement. The opened receptacle <b>172</b> fills with fluid. This process occurs when the pump moves from the position of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref> to the position of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> shows the pump <b>20</b> at the end of the stroke, with the receptacle <b>172</b> fully opened (i.e., full of fluid).</p>
  <p num="p-0221">During a patient fill or drain stroke, again with the upper membrane <b>162</b> vacuum-pressed against the upper chamber wall <b>216</b>, and the lower membrane <b>164</b> and the diaphragm <b>232</b> vacuum-pressed against the piston head <b>214</b>, the motor <b>22</b>/actuator <b>24</b> cause the piston head <b>214</b> to move upwardly towards the upper chamber wall <b>216</b>, decreasing the volume within the flexible receptacle <b>172</b> and producing a positive pressure within same. The positive pressure pushes dialysate from the receptacle <b>172</b> to the patient <b>12</b> or the drain <b>18</b> as dictated by the current valve arrangement. The receptacle <b>172</b> closes as the lower membrane <b>164</b> moves upward towards the upper membrane <b>162</b>. This process occurs when the pump moves from the position of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> to the position of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref> shows the pump <b>20</b> at the end of the stroke, with the receptacle <b>172</b> empty or virtually empty.</p>
  <p num="p-0222">In the event that air (“air” for purposes of this invention includes air as well as other gases which may be present, particularly those that have escaped from the patient's peritoneal cavity) enters the fluid receptacle <b>172</b>, it must be purged to maintain accuracy. It should be appreciated that if air enters between the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b>, the presently preferred system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> does not have the ability to pull a vacuum between the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b>. The elasticity of the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b>, however, naturally tend to purge air therefrom. In an alternative embodiment the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> can be adapted to provide a vacuum source that pulls a vacuum between the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> to purge air therefrom.</p>
  <p num="p-0223">To purge air from between the membranes, the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> also provides a positive pressure source. In systems <b>10</b>, <b>100</b>, for example, the pump motor <b>46</b> can be used in reverse of normal operation and, instead of producing vacuum source <b>44</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>), produce a positive pressure. The system <b>10</b> applies a positive pressure through the aperture or port <b>222</b> in the upper chamber wall <b>216</b> when air is detected between the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> or elsewhere in the disposable unit <b>160</b> or tubing. In one purge procedure, the controller <b>30</b> causes the motor <b>22</b>/actuator <b>24</b> to move the piston head <b>214</b> to approximately a halfway point in either the positive or negative strokes. With the upper membrane <b>162</b> vacuum-pressed against the upper chamber wall <b>216</b>, and the lower membrane <b>164</b> and the diaphragm <b>232</b> vacuum-pressed against the piston head <b>214</b> maintained at the halfway point, the controller causes the negative pressure source in through the aperture <b>222</b> to change to a positive pressure source, which pushes the upper membrane <b>162</b> conformingly against the lower membrane <b>164</b>, which is supported by the piston head <b>214</b> and the diaphragm <b>232</b>. Any air or fluid residing in the receptacle <b>172</b> is purged to drain as is any air between the receptacle <b>172</b> and drain <b>18</b>.</p>
  <heading>B. Capacitance Volume Sensor</heading> <p num="p-0224"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref> also illustrate that the pump <b>20</b> cooperates with an embodiment of the capacitance fluid volume sensor <b>60</b> of the system <b>10</b>. One embodiment of a capacitance sensor <b>60</b> is disclosed in greater detail in the patent application entitled, “Capacitance Fluid Volume Measurement,” Ser. No. 10/054,487, filed on Jan. 22, 2002, incorporated herein by reference. The capacitance sensor <b>60</b> uses capacitance measurement techniques to determine the volume of a fluid inside of a chamber. As the volume of the fluid changes, a sensed voltage that is proportional to the change in capacitance changes. Therefore, the sensor <b>60</b> can determine whether the chamber is, for example, empty, an eighth full, quarter full, half full, full, or any other percent full. Each of these measurements can be made accurately, for example, at least on the order of the accuracy achieved by known gravimetric scales or pressure/volume measurements. The present invention, however, is simpler, non-invasive, inexpensive and does not require the medical operation to be a batch operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0225">Generally, the capacitance C between two capacitor plates changes according to the function C=k×(S/d), wherein k is the dielectric constant, S is the surface area of the individual plates and d is the distance between the plates. The capacitance between the plates changes proportionally according to the function 1/(R×V), wherein R is a known resistance and V is the voltage measured across the capacitor plates.</p>
  <p num="p-0226">The dielectric constant k of medical fluid or dialysate is much higher than that of air, which typically fills the pump chamber <b>210</b> when the piston head <b>214</b> is bottomed out against the upper chamber wall <b>216</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>. Therefore, the varying distance, Δd, of the low dielectric displacement fluid between the expanding and contracting receptacle <b>172</b> and the lower chamber wall <b>218</b> may have some effect on the capacitance between ground capacitance plate <b>224</b> and the active capacitance plate <b>226</b>. Likewise the surface area, S, of the capacitance plates and the moving membrane <b>164</b> may have some effect on the capacitance. Certainly, the changing overall dielectric from the high dielectric dialysate replacing the low dielectric air (or vice versa) affects the overall capacitance between the plates <b>224</b> and <b>226</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0227">As the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> expand and fill with medical fluid, the overall capacitance changes, i.e., increases. The sensor <b>60</b> generates a high impedance potential across the grounded and active capacitor plates <b>224</b> and <b>226</b>. The high impedance potential is indicative of an amount of fluid in the receptacle <b>172</b>. If the potential does not change over time when it is expected to change, the sensor <b>60</b> can also indicate an amount or portion of air within the receptacle <b>172</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0228">A capacitance sensing circuit amplifies the high impedance signal to produce a low impedance potential. The low impedance potential is also fed back to the guard plate <b>228</b>, which protects the sensitive signal from being effected by outside electrical influences. The amplified potential is converted to a digital signal and fed to the processor <b>34</b>, where it is filtered and/or summed. The video monitor <b>40</b> can then be used to visually provide a volume and/or a flowrate indication to a patient or operator. Additionally, the processor <b>34</b> can use the summed outputs to control the pump <b>20</b> of the system <b>10</b>, for example, to terminate dialysate flow upon reaching predetermined overall volume.</p>
  <p num="p-0229">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the pump <b>120</b> of the system <b>100</b> is illustrated in operation with the capacitance sensor <b>60</b> of the present invention. The pump <b>120</b> forms a clamshell with first and second portions <b>246</b> and <b>248</b>, which together form the pump chamber <b>250</b>. The portions <b>246</b> and <b>248</b> are rigid, fixed volume, disked shaped indentations in the base <b>114</b> and lid <b>116</b> of the hardware unit <b>110</b>. The clamshell first and second portions <b>246</b> and <b>248</b> are closed and sealed on the pump receptacle portion <b>172</b> of the disposable unit <b>110</b>, which includes the expandable membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0230">An opening or aperture <b>252</b> is defined between the first and second clamshell portions <b>246</b> and <b>248</b> and the flexible membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b>. The opening <b>252</b> enables medical fluid, for example, dialysate, to enter and exit the chamber <b>250</b> between the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> in the receptacle portion <b>172</b>. The receptacle portion <b>172</b> fluidly communicates with the valve manifold <b>190</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0231"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows the pump chamber <b>250</b> in an empty state with both membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> in relaxed positions, so that the flexible receptacle portion <b>172</b> is closed. The empty volume state is achieved when the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> have collapsed so that substantially all the fluid is removed from the sterile receptacle <b>172</b> and likewise the pump chamber <b>250</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0232">The empty volume state can be achieved, for example, by allowing the elastic membranes <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> to return to their relaxed, unstressed state as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. Also, both membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> can be forced together against each other or against either one of the inside portions <b>246</b> and <b>248</b> of the pump chamber <b>250</b>. When the pump chamber <b>250</b> is in the full state, the medical fluid resides between the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b>, wherein the membranes have been suctioned against the inner walls of portions <b>246</b> and <b>248</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0233">It should be appreciated that either one or both of the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> can be moved towards and away from the clamshell portions <b>246</b> and <b>248</b> by any suitable fluid activation device. In various embodiments, the diaphragm pump is pneumatically or hydraulically actuated.</p>
  <p num="p-0234">The diaphragm pump <b>120</b> of the system <b>100</b> does not require a separate piston or mechanical actuator as does the pump <b>20</b> of the system <b>10</b>. The clamshell portions <b>246</b> and <b>248</b> define ports <b>254</b> and <b>256</b>, respectively, to allow for movement of a displacement fluid (for example, pneumatic or hydraulic fluid) into and out of the chamber areas outside of the receptacle <b>172</b> to operate the diaphragm pump.</p>
  <p num="p-0235">In an embodiment, the medical fluid, for example, dialysate, is suctioned into the receptacle <b>172</b> in the chamber <b>250</b>. The receptacle <b>172</b>, defined by membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b>, may be filled with medical fluid by applying negative pressures to one or both of the chamber ports <b>254</b> and <b>256</b>. The medical fluid can be emptied from the receptacle <b>172</b> by applying a positive pressure to at least one of the ports <b>254</b> and <b>256</b>, or by allowing the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> to spring back into shape. In an alternative embodiment, the medical fluid, for example, dialysate, is pressurized from an external source to move in and out of the pump chamber <b>250</b> between the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0236">The clamshell portions <b>246</b> and <b>248</b> form and hold the capacitor plates of the capacitance sensor <b>60</b>. In an embodiment, upper clamshell portion <b>246</b> includes an active metal or otherwise conductive capacitance plate <b>258</b> between electrically insulative or plastic layers. A metal guard plate <b>260</b> is provided on the outer plastic layer of the upper clamshell portion <b>246</b>. The guard plate <b>260</b> provides noise protection for the high impedance signal that transmits from the active capacitor plate <b>258</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0237">As with the pump <b>20</b> of system <b>10</b>, the active capacitor plate <b>258</b> of upper clamshell portion <b>246</b> of the pump <b>120</b> of the system <b>100</b> electrically couples to a capacitance sensing circuit. The guard plate <b>260</b> likewise electrically couples to the feedback loop of the capacitance sensing circuit as described above.</p>
  <p num="p-0238">In an embodiment, lower clamshell portion <b>248</b> is also made of an inert plastic, wherein a metal capacitor plate <b>262</b> attaches to the outer surface of the lower clamshell portion <b>248</b>. The metal capacitor plate <b>262</b> disposed on the outside of the clamshell portion <b>248</b> electrically couples to ground.</p>
  <p num="p-0239">In one implementation, a negative pressure is constantly maintained at the lower port <b>256</b>, so that the lower membrane <b>164</b> is pulled to conform to the inner surface of the grounded clamshell portion <b>248</b> during a multitude of fill and empty cycles. In this implementation, the upper membrane <b>162</b> does the pumping work. That is, when a negative pressure is applied to upper port <b>254</b> of upper clamshell <b>246</b>, upper membrane <b>162</b> is suctioned up against and conforms with the inner surface of upper clamshell <b>246</b>. This action draws fluid from the supply bag <b>14</b>, through the manifold <b>190</b>, and into the receptacle <b>172</b>. To expel fluid, the negative pressure is released from upper port <b>254</b>, wherein upper membrane <b>162</b> collapses to push the fluid from the receptacle <b>172</b>. Alternatively, a positive pressure is applied through one or both ports.</p>
  <p num="p-0240">In operation, the capacitance sensor <b>60</b> operates substantially as described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>. The receptacle <b>172</b> expands between the portions <b>246</b> and <b>248</b>. A varying distance, Δd, of the low dielectric displacement fluid between the expanding and contracting receptacle <b>172</b> and the portions <b>246</b> and <b>248</b> may have some effect on the capacitance between the ground plate <b>262</b> and the active plate <b>258</b>. Likewise the surface area, S, defined by the ground and active capacitance plates and the expanding membranes may have some effect on the overall capacitance. Certainly, the changing overall dielectric from the high dielectric dialysate replacing the low dielectric air (or vice versa) affects the overall capacitance between the plates <b>258</b> and <b>262</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0241">As the membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> expand and fill with medical fluid, the capacitance changes, i.e., increases. Each different amount of medical fluid within the chamber <b>250</b> has a unique overall capacitance. A unique capacitance value can therefore be associated with each specific fluid volume in the chamber, for example, substantially empty, partially full, or substantially full.</p>
  <p num="p-0242">As an alternative to the capacitance volume sensor <b>60</b> described above, the volume of dialysate fluid flowing through the automated systems <b>10</b> and <b>100</b> can be determined using other methods, such as through an electronic balance. In such a case, the electronic balance keeps track of the amount of dialysate that is supplied to the system during a priming of the system. The electronic balance also monitors any additional dialysate added to the system during dialysis treatment.</p>
  <p num="p-0243">In other alternative embodiments, any of the systems described herein can be sensed using other types of flowmeters or devices employing Boyle's Law, which are known to those of skill in the art. Further, various other types of fluid volume measurement or flowrate devices can be used with the automated systems <b>10</b> and <b>100</b>, such as orifice plates, mass flow meters or other flow measuring devices known to those of skill in the art.</p>
  <heading>VI. Precision Pressure Control</heading> <p num="p-0244">As discussed above, the system <b>10</b> employs a valve actuator <b>24</b> and a pump motor <b>22</b>. In one embodiment the pump motor <b>22</b> is a stepper motor. In another embodiment, the motor <b>22</b> may be a DC motor or other type of repeatable and accurately positionable motor. Each of these types of motors enable system <b>10</b> to position the piston <b>212</b> and piston head <b>214</b> very accurately within the pump chamber <b>210</b>. In the case of a high precision rotary motor <b>22</b>, the actuator <b>24</b> converts the rotary motion into a translation motion precisely and moves the piston <b>212</b> back and forth within the chamber <b>210</b> within the accuracy and repeatability requirement of the system. The resolution of the linear stepper motor in an embodiment is about 0.00012 inches per step to about 0.00192 inches per step.</p>
  <p num="p-0245">The pump motor <b>22</b> is also programmable. The programmable nature of the pump motor <b>22</b> enables acceleration, velocity and positional data to be entered into the controller <b>30</b>, wherein the controller <b>30</b> uses the information to position the piston <b>212</b> and piston head <b>214</b> within the pump chamber <b>210</b>, within an appropriate amount of time, to produce a desired amount of force or fluid pressure. The ability to preset the acceleration, velocity and position of the piston head <b>214</b> provides an advantage over purely pneumatic systems that respond relatively sluggishly to pneumatic signals.</p>
  <p num="p-0246">The flexible nature of the PVC medical tubing described, e.g., in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and the membrane material, described above in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, causes the system <b>10</b> to have what is known as “compliance”. Compliance is caused when the system <b>10</b> attempts to create fluid pressure, e.g., by moving the pump piston <b>212</b> and head <b>214</b>, but instead causes the flexible tubing and membranes to expand. With the flexible tubing and membranes, compliance is inevitable Eventually, when the tubing and membranes have expanded to their elastic limit, the pressure in the pump chamber <b>210</b> (i.e., in the receptacle <b>172</b>) and throughout the tubing rises sharply. It is desirable to overcome the compliance of the tubing and membranes <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> as quickly as possible so that pressure may be built to drive the fluid.</p>
  <p num="p-0247">The present invention uses a hybrid pressure control system that combines the ability to preset the pump piston acceleration and velocity with an adaptive pressure control scheme, which causes the pressure to achieve a desired pressure set point for any given stroke and causes the pressure to be fine tuned over time, i.e., over repeated strokes. That is, the present invention employs a method of controlling pressure within the system that seeks first to overcome system compliance and then seeks to achieve a desired pressure set point. The output of the present method of controlling pressure within the pump chamber <b>210</b> is illustrated by the velocity and pressure curves of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0248">In general, the system <b>10</b> controls the pressure within the receptacle <b>172</b> in the pump chamber <b>210</b> by controlling the velocity of the piston <b>212</b> and piston head <b>214</b>. The velocity profile <b>390</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates a single pump stroke that occurs over a time “t” beginning at the start of stroke position <b>392</b>. In the beginning of the stroke, the velocity ramps up at a preset acceleration <b>394</b>. The preset acceleration <b>394</b> is programmed into the controller <b>30</b>. When the velocity due to the preset acceleration <b>394</b> reaches a max velocity <b>396</b>, the acceleration <b>394</b> changes to a zero acceleration, and the piston <b>212</b> moves at the constant max velocity <b>396</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0249">During the time period of the acceleration <b>394</b> and the max velocity <b>396</b>, which is designated by the dashed vertical line <b>398</b>, the corresponding pressure as illustrated by a pressure curve <b>401</b> of pressure profile <b>400</b>, ramps up beginning very slowly and exponentially increasing as the time reaches that of the dashed line <b>398</b>. In the initial portion of the pressure curve, i.e., just after the start of stroke position, the pressure builds slowly as the compliance in the system is taken up. As the compliance is taken up, the pressure builds at faster and faster rates.</p>
  <p num="p-0250">When the pressure reaches a pressure proximity threshold <b>402</b>, set in software, the software within the controller <b>30</b> converts from the previous motion (acceleration, velocity, position) control to an adaptive control. It should therefore be appreciated that the method of controlling pressure within the fluid pump of the present invention is a hybrid type of control method, employing a combination of techniques.</p>
  <p num="p-0251">The motion control portion, accented by the acceleration <b>394</b> and max velocity <b>396</b>, represents a period in time when the method of control is forcing the system to overcome the pressure compliance. Upon reaching the pressure proximity threshold <b>402</b>, the controller <b>30</b> causes the velocity to sharply decelerate at deceleration <b>404</b>. Deceleration <b>404</b> reduces the velocity of the piston <b>212</b> and piston head <b>214</b> to a velocity <b>406</b>, which is a velocity that aids in the ability of the adaptive control portion of the pressure control system to achieve a pressure set point <b>408</b>. That is, without the programmed deceleration <b>404</b>, the adaptive control portion would have a more difficult (i.e., longer) time controlling the velocity to make the pressure reach or substantially reach the pressure set point <b>408</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0252">As explained in more detail below, the acceleration <b>394</b> is adaptively controlled in an embodiment, so as to reduce the amount of initial overshoot. The adaptive control over the acceleration <b>394</b> is fine tuned over time to further reduce the amount of initial overshoot. Each of these measures affects the amount of controlled deceleration <b>404</b> needed.</p>
  <p num="p-0253">After the controlled deceleration <b>404</b> reaches the velocity <b>406</b> and until the time of the second dashed line <b>410</b>, the system <b>10</b> operates in an adaptive mode. The second vertical line <b>410</b> occurs near the end of the stroke. As illustrated, the adaptive portion of the stroke is broken down into a number of areas, namely area <b>412</b> and area <b>414</b>. Area <b>412</b> is characterized by the overshoot or undershoot caused by the programmed acceleration <b>394</b>. In applying adaptive techniques, the adjustments or parameters that overcome area <b>414</b> error are tailored in software to combat overshoot or undershoot. The area <b>414</b> focuses on attempting to minimize the error between the actual pressure curve <b>401</b> and the pressure set point <b>408</b>. During the area <b>414</b>, the parameters and adaptive measures are tailored in software reduce the oscillation of the pressure curve <b>401</b> to achieve a pressure set point <b>408</b> as much as possible and as quickly as possible.</p>
  <p num="p-0254">Upon reaching the time denoted by the dashed line <b>410</b>, the pressure control method once again resumes motion control and decelerates the velocity at a controlled and predetermined deceleration <b>416</b> down to a final travel velocity <b>418</b>, which is also the initial velocity at the start of the stroke <b>392</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the method can simply let the adaptive control continue past the time line <b>410</b> and attempt to achieve the final travel velocity <b>418</b>. After the time line <b>410</b>, the pressure along pressure curve <b>401</b> falls off towards zero pressure as illustrated by the pressure profile <b>400</b>. Comparing the pressure profile <b>400</b> to the velocity profile <b>390</b>, it should be appreciated that pressure remains in the receptacle <b>172</b> of the pump chamber <b>210</b> even after the stroke ends at time “t”. In some cases, the pressure overshoots as the piston <b>212</b> suddenly stops, wherein the momentum of the liquid produces a pressure spike after time “t”.</p>
  <p num="p-0255">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, an algorithm <b>420</b> for employing the adaptive pressure control during the areas <b>412</b> and <b>414</b> of the pressure profile <b>400</b> is illustrated. In an embodiment, the adaptive control portion of the pressure control method employs a proportional, integral and derivative (“PID”) adaptive parameters. In the method, a pressure reading is taken from a pressure sensor which senses the pressure inside the receptacle <b>172</b> of the pump chamber <b>210</b>, and which provides a pressure sensor input <b>422</b> to the controller <b>30</b>, as illustrated by the algorithm <b>420</b>. Pressure sensor input <b>422</b> is sent through a digital filter <b>424</b>, producing a measured variable <b>426</b>. The measured variable <b>426</b> is compared with a desired variable, i.e., the pressure set point <b>408</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, wherein an error <b>428</b> is produced between the measured variable <b>426</b> and the desired pressure set point <b>408</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0256">Next, the error <b>428</b> is entered into a PID calculation <b>430</b>, which uses a proportional coefficient <b>432</b>, an integral coefficient <b>434</b> and a differential coefficient <b>436</b>. The output of the PID calculation <b>430</b> is an adaptive pressure change <b>438</b>. The controller <b>30</b> then changes the velocity up or down to produce the pressure change <b>438</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0257">In the pressure profile <b>400</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the algorithm <b>420</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is constantly being performed during the adaptive areas <b>412</b> and <b>414</b>. As discussed below, the corrective parameters, e.g., the coefficients <b>432</b>, <b>434</b> and <b>436</b>, are used differently during the areas <b>412</b> and <b>414</b> because correction in the area <b>412</b> is focused on minimizing overshoot and undershoot, while correction in the area <b>414</b> however is focused on reducing error to zero about the pressure set point <b>408</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0258">As described above, a single pump <b>20</b> is used in the system <b>10</b>. The single pump <b>20</b> provides positive pressure during the patient fill stroke and the pump to drain stroke. The pump <b>20</b> also provides negative pressure during the pull from supply bag <b>14</b> stroke and the pull from patient <b>12</b> stroke. Of the four strokes, it is most important to accurately control the pressure during the patient fill and patient drain stoke. It is not as critical to control the pressure when pumping fluid from the supply bags <b>14</b> or when pumping fluid from the receptacle <b>172</b> of the pump chamber <b>210</b> to drain <b>18</b>. In the two positive pressure strokes, one stroke, namely the patient fill stroke, it is critical to properly control pressure. In the two negative pressure strokes, one of the strokes, namely the pull from patient stroke, it is critical to properly control pressure. In the other two strokes, pressure is controlled without taxing the controller, motor <b>22</b> and disposable unit <b>160</b> needlessly.</p>
  <p num="p-0259">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, pressure and velocity curves are shown for a number of strokes during the patient fill cycle. The upper profile <b>440</b> shows the actual pressure <b>444</b> versus the desired pressure <b>442</b> in milli-pounds per square inch (“mPSI”). The lower profile <b>450</b> shows corresponding velocity curves. In the pressure profile <b>440</b>, the darkened line <b>442</b> corresponds to the desired pressure in mPSI. The curve <b>444</b> illustrates the actual pressure in MPSI. The curves <b>452</b> <i>a</i>, <b>452</b> <i>b </i>and <b>452</b> <i>c </i>in the velocity profile <b>450</b> illustrate the piston velocities that produce the pressure fluctuations along the pressure curve <b>444</b> of the pressure profile <b>440</b>. The velocity is measured in some increment of steps per second, such as milli-steps per second or micro steps per second when the motor <b>22</b> employed is a stepper motor. Different stepper motors for use in the present invention may be programmed in different increments of a step. The actual velocity is therefore a function of the resolution of the stepper motor.</p>
  <p num="p-0260">At time zero, the desired pressure <b>442</b> changes virtually instantaneously to 2000 mPSI. The desired pressure curve <b>442</b> maintains this constant 2000 mPSI until reaching approximately 1.6 seconds, at which point the desired pressure <b>442</b> returns virtually instantaneously to zero. This step by the desired pressure curve <b>442</b> represents one complete patient fill stroke, wherein one full positive up-stroke of the piston <b>212</b> and piston head <b>214</b> within the pump chamber <b>220</b> occurs. In this step it is critical to control pressure because dialysate is being pumped into the patient's peritoneal cavity <b>12</b>. The actual pressure curve <b>444</b> ramps up exponentially and oscillates about the 2000 mPSI set point in the manner described in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. It should also be noted that the velocity curve <b>452</b> <i>a </i>follows a similar pattern to that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0261">At about 1.6 seconds, i.e., when the piston head has reached the upper chamber <b>216</b> of the valve chamber <b>210</b>, controller <b>30</b> stops the piston <b>212</b> from moving. The velocity of the piston head remains at zero until approximately 3.4 seconds. In this period, the valves have all been closed via one of the “all valves closed” positions illustrated in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>. As illustrated by pressure curve <b>444</b>, residual fluid pressure resides within the pump chamber <b>210</b> even though the piston head <b>214</b> is not moving.</p>
  <p num="p-0262">At about time 3.4 seconds, the desired pressure curve <b>442</b> switches virtuously instantaneously to −2000 mPSI. The pump <b>20</b> is now being asked to expand and form a negative pressure that pulls fluid from the supply bags <b>14</b>. During this stroke, it is not as critical to control pressure as accurately in the patient fill stroke. Accordingly, the method may be programmed to bypass the motion control portion of the pressure control method and simply adaptively seek to find the pressure set point along line <b>442</b>. Dialysate moves through the fluid heating path <b>180</b> of the disposable unit <b>160</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 5</figref>, etc.) during the patient fill stroke. Much of the compliance, i.e., stretching of the system occurs when the fluid passes through the path <b>180</b>. Pumping fluid from the supply bag <b>14</b>, however, does not require the fluid to pass through the heating path <b>180</b>. The system <b>10</b> does not therefore experience the same level of compliance during this stroke. It is possible to pump from the bags <b>14</b> without using the motion control portion illustrated in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, since the lessened compliance may not require the “brute force” supplied by the controlled acceleration.</p>
  <p num="p-0263">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the pump completes the stroke that pulls dialysate from the supply bag at about five seconds. The demand pressure along curve <b>442</b> returns to zero accordingly. Next, the valve switches to an all closed position, the controller <b>30</b> sets the piston speed to zero, and the piston head resides substantially along the lower chamber wall <b>218</b>, with the receptacle <b>172</b> full of fluid until approximately 6.8 seconds has passed, wherein the system <b>10</b> repeats the patient fill stroke as described previously.</p>
  <p num="p-0264">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, a pressure profile <b>452</b> and a velocity profile <b>460</b> are illustrated for the patient drain stroke and the pump to drain stroke of the patient drain cycle. In the pressure profile <b>452</b>, the demand pressure curve <b>454</b> illustrates that the controller calls for a negative 2500 mPSI to pull dialysate from the patient. The controller <b>30</b> calls for a positive pressure of 2500 mPSI to push fluid from the receptacle <b>172</b> of the pump chamber <b>210</b> to the drain bag <b>18</b>. In the velocity profile <b>460</b> shown below the pressure profile <b>452</b>, the actual velocity <b>462</b> in some increment of steps per second is illustrated. It should be appreciated that both velocity profiles <b>450</b> and <b>460</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</figref> are absolute velocities and do not illustrate that the pump piston <b>212</b> moves in positive and negative directions.</p>
  <p num="p-0265">The actual pressure curve <b>456</b> of the profile <b>452</b> illustrates that the pressure is controlled to conform to the demand pressure line <b>454</b> more closely during the pull from patient portion than during the pump to drain portion of the profile <b>452</b>. In an embodiment, the controller <b>30</b> is programmed to provide a motion controlled velocity <b>464</b> for a portion of the pull from patient stroke and use an adaptive control during the time “t<sub>adapt</sub>”. The method also uses, in an embodiment, a controlled deceleration <b>466</b> at the end of the pull from patient stroke. Alternatively, the method allows the PID control to seek to find zero pressure. Similarly, during the pump to drain stroke, the controller <b>30</b> can switch to PID control only.</p>
  <p num="p-0266">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, one embodiment of an algorithm <b>470</b> illustrating the “fine tuning” adaptive control of the PID portion of the pressure control method of the present invention is illustrated. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, like <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, includes a measured pressure variable <b>426</b> and a desirable pressure set point <b>408</b>. The pressure error <b>472</b> represents an error in either the overshoot area <b>412</b> or the oscillation area <b>414</b> illustrated in the pressure velocity profile <b>400</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. For each area, the algorithm <b>470</b> looks at two error components, namely, the error <b>474</b> determined in the current stroke and the error <b>476</b> stored for previous strokes. The controller <b>30</b> compares the two errors <b>476</b> and <b>478</b> and makes a decision as illustrated in decision block <b>478</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0267">In the block <b>476</b>, if the current stroke error <b>474</b> is less than the previous stroke error <b>476</b>, the method uses the previous coefficient because the previous coefficient is currently having a desirable result. If the current stroke error <b>474</b> is greater than the previous strokes error <b>476</b>, two possibilities exist. First, the coefficient or corrective measure taken is not large enough to overcome the error increase. Here, the coefficient or corrective setting can be increased or another tactic may be employed. Second, the previous corrective procedure may be having an adverse impact, in which case the parameter connection can be reversed or another tactic can be employed. Obviously, to employ algorithm <b>470</b>, the method provides that the controller <b>30</b> store the manner of the previous corrective attempts and outcomes of same. Based on what has happened previously, the controller decides to increment or decrease one or more of the parameters. The amount of increase or decrease is then applied to one or more coefficients stored in an increment table <b>480</b>. The adjusted or non-adjusted increment is then summed together with the currently used one or more coefficients <b>482</b> to form an adjusted one or more coefficients <b>484</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0268">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, table <b>500</b> illustrates various different coefficients and adaptive perimeters for the pressure control method of the present invention. Certain of the coefficients and parameters apply more to the motion control portion of the profiles illustrated above, i.e., the set acceleration, deceleration and velocity portions of the profiles. The motion control parameters, however, effect the error, which influences the adaptive parameters in the PID portion of the pressure control. Other parameters apply to the adaptive control portions of the profiles. Adjusting the beginning stroke acceleration parameter <b>486</b> (illustrated by the acceleration <b>394</b> of the velocity profile <b>390</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) affects the motion control portion of the present method. Acceleration as illustrated, affects overshoot and the efficient use of stroke time. That is, it is desirable to have a high acceleration to overcome compliance quickly, however, the cost may be that overshoot increases. On the other hand, a lower acceleration may reduce overshoot but require more time to overcome the compliance in the system.</p>
  <p num="p-0269">The proximately threshold parameter <b>488</b> (illustrated by pressure line <b>402</b> in the pressure profile <b>400</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) also affects overshoot and undershoot. Here, setting the pressure threshold <b>488</b> too low may cause undershoot, whereas setting the parameter <b>488</b> too high may cause overshoot. The DP/dt parameter <b>490</b> is the change in pressure for a given period of time. This parameter seeks to achieve, for example in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, a certain slope of the pressure curve <b>401</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0270">The maximum travel velocity parameter <b>492</b>, illustrated as line <b>396</b> in the velocity profile <b>390</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, also affects overshoot and subsequent resonance. Another corrective factor is the conversion to pressure deceleration <b>494</b> corresponding to line <b>410</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. The method includes running the system without changing back to motion control and instead leaving the system in the adaptive PID control. The conversion to deceleration can have a large impact on the residual pressure remaining in the pump chamber <b>210</b> after the valves close.</p>
  <p num="p-0271">The PID factors Kp, Kd and Ki, labeled <b>496</b>, <b>498</b> and <b>502</b>, respectively, affect the adaptive control portion of the present method but also affect, to a lesser extent, the controlled declaration at the end of the stroke. Each of the PID factors or parameters can be changed and adapted in mid-stroke. Also as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the factors can be changed so as to optimize the system over time.</p>
  <p num="p-0272">Each of the above-described factors can be used to insulate the fluid pressure from changes in the environment outside of the system <b>10</b>. For example, the factors can overcome changes due to physiological and chemical changes in the patient's abdomen. Also, the height of the patient supply bags <b>14</b> affects the initial loading of the fluid pump <b>20</b>. The parameters illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> automatically overcome the changes due to bag height. Further, as the patient sleeps through the night, the supply bags <b>14</b> become less and less full, while the drain bag <b>18</b> becomes more full, both of which affect the pump pressure. The parameters illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> are automatically adjustable to compensate for these changes and keep the system running smoothly.</p>
  <p num="p-0273">Certain of the above-described factors is changed more and used more during the overshoot area <b>412</b> illustrated in the pressure profile <b>400</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. Other factors and parameters are used and changed more during the oscillation portion <b>414</b> of the profile <b>400</b>.</p>
  <heading>VII. In-Line Heater</heading> <p num="p-0274">In an embodiment, the inline heater <b>16</b> includes two electrical plate heaters, which are well known to those of skill in the art. The plate heaters of the heater <b>16</b> have a smooth and flat surface, which faces the disposable unit <b>160</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the automated systems <b>10</b> and <b>100</b> provide an in-line heater <b>16</b> having a plate heater in combination with an infrared heater or other convective heater.</p>
  <p num="p-0275">In the alternative dual mode type heater, both the plate heater and, for example, the infrared heater are in-line heaters that heat the medical fluid that flows through the fluid heating path <b>180</b> of the disposable unit <b>160</b>. The radiant energy of the infrared heater is directed to and absorbed by the fluid in the fluid heating path <b>180</b>. The radiant energy or infrared heater in an embodiment is a primary or high capacity heater, which can heat a relatively large volume of cold fluid to a desired temperature in a short period of time.</p>
  <p num="p-0276">The plate heater of the alternative dual mode heater in an embodiment is a secondary or maintenance heater which has a relatively lower heating capacity relative to the infrared heater. As described above, the plate heater uses electrical resistance to increase the temperature of a plate that in turn heats the fluid flowing though the path <b>180</b> adjacent to the plate.</p>
  <p num="p-0277">The dual mode heater is particularly useful for quickly heating cool dialysate (high heat energy demand) supplied from one of the supply bags <b>14</b> to the automated system <b>10</b> or <b>100</b>. Initial system fills can be cooler than later fills, and the system can lose heat during the dwell phase. The temperature of the dialysate at initial system fill can therefore be quite low, such as 5° C. to 10° C. if the supply bags <b>14</b> are stored in cold ambient temperature.</p>
  <p num="p-0278">The plate heater and the infrared heater of the dual mode heater embodiment of the heater <b>16</b> can be arranged in various configurations relative to each other. The dual mode heaters in an embodiment are arranged so that the fluid passes by the heaters sequentially (e.g., first the plate heater and then the radiant or infrared heater). In another embodiment, the fluid passes by the heaters simultaneously (both heaters at the same time). The fluid flow path past the heaters can be a common flow path for both heaters, such as in the fluid heating path <b>180</b>, or include independent flow paths for each heater.</p>
  <heading>VIII. Fuzzy Logic for Heater Control</heading> <p num="p-0279">Similar to the controlling of the fluid pressure, the control of the plate heater <b>16</b> is also subject to a number of environmental variables. For example, the ambient temperature inside the patient's home affects the amount of heat that is needed to raise the temperature of the medical fluid to a desired temperature. Obviously, the temperature of the dialysate in the supply bags <b>14</b> affects the amount of heat that is needed to raise the fluid temperature to a desired temperature. Plate heater efficiency also affects the amount of heating needed. Further, the voltage provided by the patient's home is another factor. Typically, a doctor or caregiver prescribes the temperature of the dialysate for the patient to be controlled to around a temperature of 37° C. It is, therefore, desirable to have a method of controlling the heater <b>16</b> to correct for outside temperature gradients so as to maintain the proper patient fluid temperature.</p>
  <p num="p-0280">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, one embodiment of a heating control method <b>510</b> is illustrated. The method <b>510</b> includes two separately performed algorithms <b>520</b> and <b>530</b> that operate in parallel to form an overall output <b>544</b>. The algorithm <b>520</b> is termed a “knowledge-based” control algorithm. The knowledge-based control algorithm is based on knowledge, such as empirical data, flow mechanics, laws of physics and lab data, etc.</p>
  <p num="p-0281">The knowledge-based algorithm <b>520</b> requires a number of inputs as well as a number of constant settings. For example, the control algorithm <b>520</b> requires an input pulsatile flowrate. As illustrated below, the pulsatile flowrate is actually calculated from a number of input variables. The system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> of the present invention provides fluid to the patient <b>12</b> in pulses, rather than on a continuous basis. It should be readily apparent from the discussion based on <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref>, that when all valve heads in the disposable are closed, no fluid can flow through the fluid heating pathway to the patient. The flowrate of fluid to the patient is therefore a pulsatile flowrate, wherein the patient receives the dialysate in spurts or pulses. It is difficult to control fluid temperature with this type of flowrate. To this end, the method <b>510</b> provides the dual algorithms <b>520</b> and <b>530</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0282">Besides the pulsatile flowrate, the knowledge-based control algorithm <b>520</b> also receives a measured, i.e., actual, fluid inlet temperature signal. Further, the algorithm <b>520</b> stores the plate heater efficiency, which is based on empirical data. In one embodiment, the upper and lower plates of the plate heater <b>16</b> are around 95% efficient. Algorithm <b>520</b> also inputs the total heater power, which is derived from the voltage input into the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b>. Residential voltage may vary in a given day or over a period of days or from place to place.</p>
  <p num="p-0283">The algorithm <b>520</b> also inputs the desired outlet fluid temperature, which is a constant setting but which may be modified by the patient's doctor or caregiver. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the desired outlet fluid temperature is inputted into both the knowledge-based control algorithm <b>520</b> and the fuzzy logic based control algorithm <b>530</b>. As discussed in more detail below, the knowledge-based control algorithm <b>520</b> outputs a knowledge-based duty cycle into a summation point <b>544</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0284">With respect to the fuzzy logic-based control algorithm <b>530</b>, the desired fluid temperature is inputted into a comparison point <b>514</b>. The comparison point <b>514</b> outputs the difference between the desired fluid temperature and the actual measured fluid temperature exiting the heating system <b>548</b>. The fuzzy logic-based control algorithm <b>530</b> therefore receives a change in temperature ΔT as an input. As described below, the fuzzy logic-based control algorithm <b>530</b> employs the concepts and strategies of fuzzy logic control to output a fuzzy logic duty cycle.</p>
  <p num="p-0285">In the method <b>510</b>, the knowledge-based duty cycle is adaptively weighted against the fuzzy logic-based duty cycle. In an alternative embodiment, the system predetermines a relative weight. In the method <b>510</b>, the fuzzy logic-based duty cycle is weighted, i.e., provided a weight factor as illustrated in block <b>542</b>. For example, if the fuzzy logic-based duty cycle is given a weight factor of one, then the fuzzy logic-based duty cycle is weighted equally with the knowledge-based duty cycle. If the fuzzy logic-based duty cycle is given a weight factor of two, the fuzzy logic-based duty cycle is given twice the weight as the knowledge-based duty cycle. The weight factor in block <b>542</b> can change over time and/or be optimized over time.</p>
  <p num="p-0286">It should be appreciated that the weighting block <b>542</b> could alternatively be placed in the knowledge-based duty cycle output. As discussed below, however, the update rate of the fuzzy logic control loop is substantially higher than the update rate of the input signals entered into the knowledge-based control algorithm <b>520</b>. It is therefore advantageous to weight the fuzzy logic-based duty cycle, as opposed to the knowledge-based duty cycle.</p>
  <p num="p-0287">The weighted fuzzy logic-based duty cycle and the knowledge-based duty cycle are summed together at summing point <b>544</b> to produce an overall heater duty cycle. Duty cycle is one way to control the power input and, thus, the plate temperature of the heater. Controlling the duty cycle means controlling the percentage of a time period that full power is applied to the heater, for example, plate heater <b>16</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the output of the parallel control algorithms <b>520</b> and <b>530</b> could be a percentage of full power applied at all times. Still further, the output of the parallel control algorithms <b>520</b> and <b>530</b> could be a percentage of full power applied for a percentage of a time period. For purposes of illustration, the method <b>510</b> is described using a duty cycle output which, as explained, is the percent of a time period that full power is applied to the heater.</p>
  <p num="p-0288">As described herein, the heating system <b>548</b> (i.e., heater <b>16</b>) in one preferred embodiment is a plate heater, wherein upper and lower plates are disposed about a fluid heating path of the disposable unit <b>160</b>. It should be appreciated, however, that the method <b>510</b> is equally applicable to the infrared heater previously described. Further, the method <b>510</b> is equally applicable to the combination of different types of heaters, such as, the combination of a plate heater and an infrared heater.</p>
  <p num="p-0289">The method <b>510</b> uses multiple temperature sensors, such as the sensors <b>62</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, which sense the temperature at different times within the method <b>510</b> and places within system <b>10</b>,<b>100</b>. One sensor senses the fluid outlet temperature, which feeds back from the heating system <b>548</b> to the comparison point <b>514</b>. Another two temperature sensors sense the temperature of the top plate and the bottom plate and feed back to the temperature limit controller <b>546</b>, located in software.</p>
  <p num="p-0290">As illustrated, before the summed heater duty cycle is inputted into the heating system <b>548</b>, the system determines whether the top and bottom heating plates are already at a maximum allowable temperature. There exists a temperature above which it is not safe to maintain the plates of the plate heater. In a situation where one or both of the plates is currently at the temperature limit, the method <b>510</b> outputs a zero duty cycle, regardless of the calculations of the knowledge-based control system <b>520</b> and the fuzzy logic-based algorithm <b>530</b>. To this end, the temperature of the top and bottom plates is fed back into the block <b>546</b>, wherein the software only allows a heater duty cycle to be applied to the heating system <b>548</b> if the current temperature of the top and bottom plates is less than the temperature limit.</p>
  <p num="p-0291">In an embodiment, if one of the plates is at the limit temperature, the method <b>510</b> provides a zero duty cycle to both plate heaters, even though one of the plate heaters may be below the temperature limit. Further, the software may be adapted so that if the actual temperature of the plate heater is very close to the limit temperature, the method <b>510</b> only allows the duty cycle be at or below a predetermined set point. In this manner, when the actual temperature is very near the limit temperature, the method <b>510</b> goes into a fault-type condition and uses a safe duty cycle.</p>
  <p num="p-0292">Assuming the actual plate temperatures are below the safe temperature limit, the method <b>510</b> applies the combined heater duty cycle from the parallel control algorithms at summation point <b>544</b>. The heater duty cycle applies full power for a certain percentage of a given amount of time. The given amount of time is the update speed of the fuzzy logic control loop. The fuzzy logic control loop, including the fuzzy logic control algorithm <b>530</b>, updates about nine times per second in one preferred embodiment. It should be appreciated that the update rate of the fuzzy logic control loop is an important parameter and that simply increasing the update rate to a certain value may deteriorate the accuracy of the system. One range of update rates that provide good results is from about 8.5 times per second to about 9.5 times per second.</p>
  <p num="p-0293">The update rate should not be evenly divisible into the frequency of the input power. For example, an update rate of nine times per second works when the AC frequency is held steady at 50 or 60 hertz. However, as is the case in some countries, the frequency may be 63 hertz. In such a case, an update rate of nine hertz will cause inaccuracy. Therefore, in one preferred embodiment, an update rate of a fraction of 1 hertz is preferred, such as 9.1 hertz. Assuming the update rate to be nine times per second, the time per update is approximately 110 milliseconds. Therefore, if the duty cycle is 0.5, i.e., half on, half off, the time at which full power is applied is 55 milliseconds. During the other 55 milliseconds, no power is applied. If the duty cycle is 90%, then full power is applied for 90% of 110 milliseconds.</p>
  <p num="p-0294">The update speed of the knowledge-based control algorithm <b>520</b> is not as critical as the update speed of the fuzzy logic control loop. For one reason, the signal inputs to the algorithm <b>520</b> change gradually over time so that they do not need to be checked as often as the comparison between the desired fluid temperature and the actual fluid temperature. An update rate of about two seconds is sufficient for the signal inputs. The inputs of the control algorithm <b>520</b> can be updated from about once every half second to about once every four seconds. The knowledge-based control algorithm <b>520</b> can run on the main processor of the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b>, for example, an Intel StrongARM™ Processor. To facilitate the update rate of the fuzzy logic control loop, a high speed processor, such as a Motorola Digital Signal Processor is used. The fuzzy logic-based control algorithm <b>530</b> runs, in one embodiment, on a delegate processor, e.g., a Motorola Digital Processor.</p>
  <p num="p-0295">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the knowledge-based control algorithm <b>520</b> is illustrated in more detail. As discussed above, in a first step, the knowledge-based control algorithm receives a number of signal inputs, as indicated by block <b>522</b>. Some of these inputs are updated at the main processor level of about once every two seconds. Other inputs are set in software as constants. One of the input signals that varies over time, is the number of stroke intervals (“N”) per millisecond. The pump piston moves over a certain period of time, stops and dwells, and then moves again for a certain period of time. The pump makes N number of strokes per millisecond, which is inputted into the knowledge-based control algorithm.</p>
  <p num="p-0296">Another input signal that varies over time is the input voltage (“V<sub>ac</sub>”). The input voltage V<sub>ac </sub>changes over time in a single house or in different locations. Another input signal that changes over time is the measured fluid inlet temperature (“T<sub>in</sub>”). Fluid temperature T<sub>in </sub>is measured by one of the numerous sensors of the method <b>510</b> described above. An input which will like not change over time is the plate heater efficiency (“E”). The heater efficiency E is determined empirically. The heater efficiency E could change depending upon the pressure inside the disposable unit during heating, the material of the disposable unit and the gap tolerance between the top and bottom plate. The heater efficiency E for a particular dialysis device therefore remains substantially constant. As described above, the desired fluid temperature (“T<sub>desired</sub>”) may vary, depending on doctor's orders. However, for any given therapy session, T<sub>desired </sub>is a constant.</p>
  <p num="p-0297">The knowledge-based control algorithm <b>520</b> calculates a pulsatile flowrate (“Q”) in millimeters per minute according to the formula of block <b>524</b>. The formula for Q can change based on the desired units for the flowrate. In the illustrated embodiment, the formula for Q is 60,000 multiplied by the chamber volume in milliliters, the product of which is divided by T in milliseconds. Once again, the chamber volume is a constant that is a function of pump chamber wall geometry.</p>
  <p num="p-0298">The knowledge-based control algorithm <b>520</b> also calculates the total heater power in Watts, as indicated by block <b>526</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the method <b>510</b> calculates the heater power by dividing V<sub>ac</sub> <sup>2 </sup>by a plate heater resistance. The knowledge-based control algorithm <b>520</b> then uses the above calculations to calculate the knowledge-based duty cycle, as indicated by block <b>528</b>. The knowledge-based duty cycle equals, in one embodiment, a factor, e.g., of 0.07, multiplied by the temperature difference. AT, which equals T<sub>desired </sub>minus the T<sub>in</sub>. This product is then multiplied by the pulsatile flowrate Q. The latter product is then divided by the product of the total heater power W times the heater efficiency E. The knowledge-based duty cycle is then fed into summation point <b>544</b> in combination with the fuzzy logic-based duty cycle output as illustrated by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0299">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, one embodiment for the fuzzy logic control algorithm <b>530</b> is illustrated. It should be appreciated that fuzzy logic is known generally to systems engineers and in the field of system and process control. The fuzzy logic algorithm described herein is merely one method of implementing fuzzy logic to perform the task of accepting an error input, which is the difference between the desired fluid temperature and the actual fluid temperature, and attempting to minimize this number to zero. Regardless of the method in which fuzzy logic is employed, the method inputs a temperature, sums a ΔT and outputs a power limiter, such as the duty cycle. The first step in the fuzzy logic control logic algorithm <b>530</b> is to therefore calculate the difference between T<sub>desired </sub>and T<sub>in</sub>, as indicated by block <b>532</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0300">Next, a number of membership functions are implemented, as indicated by block <b>534</b>. In this embodiment, the algorithm <b>530</b> implements five measurement functions. Two of the measurement functions, namely, nlarge and plarge, are trapezoidal membership functions. As is known in the art of fuzzy logic, the trapezoidal membership function consists of four nodes. Three other membership functions, namely nsmall, neutral and psmall, are set up as triangle membership functions, which consists of three nodes. After setting up the membership functions as indicated by block <b>534</b>, the fuzzy logic control algorithm <b>530</b> performs a fuzzification interface as indicated by block <b>536</b>. In the fuzzification interface, the control algorithm <b>530</b> converts the temperature difference ΔT, between T<sub>desired </sub>and T<sub>in </sub>to a number of fuzzy sets based on the membership functions set up as indicated in block <b>534</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0301">Next, the control algorithm <b>530</b> applies a number of fuzzy logic heating rules as indicated by block <b>538</b>. In an embodiment, the control algorithm <b>530</b> employs five fuzzy logic rules. One rules says that, if ΔT is nlarge, the output should decrease at a large pace. Another rules says that, if ΔT is nsmall, the output should decrease at a small pace. The third rule states that if ΔT is neutral, the output should be zero. A further rules states that if ΔT is psmall, the output should increase at a small pace. The final rule states that if ΔT is plarge, the output should increase at a large pace.</p>
  <p num="p-0302">The next step in the fuzzy logic control algorithm <b>530</b> is to perform a defuzzification interface, as indicated by block <b>540</b>. In the defuzzification interface, the output of the rules is converted to an actual or “crisp” output, which can then be translated into a duty cycle. In the defuzzification step indicated by block <b>590</b>, the output of the fuzzy logic rules is converted to a “crisp” or exact number. This number is then converted to the proper output for the heater which, in this embodiment, is the fuzzy heater duty cycle.</p>
  <p num="p-0303">As indicated by block <b>542</b>, the next step is to determine how much weight to place on the fuzzy logic duty cycle with respect to the knowledge-based duty cycle. The weighting factor is decided by the fuzzy logic rules and the update rates of both the knowledge based and fuzzy logic based control algorithms. The weighted fuzzy logic duty cycle is then summed in summation point <b>544</b> with the knowledge-based duty cycle yielded by the knowledge-based control algorithm <b>520</b>.</p>
  <heading>IX. Electrical Insulation for the System</heading> <p num="p-0304">Medical equipment and in particular equipment in intimate contact with a patient needs to be properly electrically insulated against leakage currents. Class I type of equipment provides basic insulation and a means of connecting to a protective earthing conductor in the building in which the equipment resides, which dissipates hazardous voltages if the equipment insulation fails. One primary use for the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> of the present invention however is in a patient's home. This presents two problems for Class I devices and in particular for dialysis machines. First, in many countries and older homes, the earthing ground is faulty, unreliable or completely absent. Second, many people bypass grounding systems that do exist. The present invention overcomes this problem by providing an automated dialysis system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> that requires no earth ground. The system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> does not simply rely on the basic insulation provided by Class I devices but provides either double insulation or reinforced insulation.</p>
  <p num="p-0305">Double insulation includes two layers of insulation. One layer of insulation can be the basic insulation. At 240 VAC, basic insulation typically requires four millimeters of “creepage” or 2.5 millimeters of “air clearance”. Creepage is the shortest distance between two conductive parts when both are disposed along a surface of insulation. Creepage is also the shortest distance between a conductive part and a bounding surface of a piece of equipment, wherein the conductive part and the equipment contact a piece of insulation. Air clearance is the shortest distance between two conductive parts or between a conductive part and a piece of equipment, measured through air.</p>
  <p num="p-0306">The additional layer of insulation is called supplemental insulation. Supplemental insulation is independent insulation applied in addition to the basic insulation to ensure protection against electric shock if the basic insulation fails. The supplemental insulation can also be in the form of creepage and clearance.</p>
  <p num="p-0307">Reinforced insulation, on the other hand, is a single layer of insulation offering the same degree of protection as double insulation. Reinforced insulation provides the electrical protection equivalent to double insulation for the rated voltage of the double insulation. For 240 VAC, used as the mains voltage of the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b>, the basic insulation can withstand 1500 VAC and the supplemental insulation can withstand 2500 VAC. The single layer of reinforced insulation must therefore withstand at least 4000 VAC.</p>
  <p num="p-0308">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, one embodiment of an electrically insulated system <b>550</b> of the present invention is illustrated. The system <b>550</b> is illustrated schematically, however, certain components of the system <b>550</b> are identifiable as components illustrated in the hardware drawings discussed above. For example, the system <b>550</b> includes the housing or enclosure <b>112</b>, illustrated above in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 4B</figref>, which includes the base <b>114</b> and the lid <b>116</b> of the hardware unit <b>110</b>. The system <b>550</b> also includes the heater <b>16</b>, which in an embodiment includes upper and lower heating plates illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and discussed in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 to 27</figref>. Further, the system <b>550</b> includes the display device <b>40</b> and temperature sensors <b>62</b> illustrated and discussed in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0309">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the numbers in parenthesis indicate the working or operating voltage of the respective component. As illustrated, the line <b>552</b> and neutral <b>554</b> supply a mains voltage of 240 VAC, single phase, in an embodiment, which is the standard voltage used residentially in many countries throughout the world. The line <b>552</b> and neutral <b>554</b> could otherwise supply the United States residential standard of 120 VAC, single phase, and indeed could provide a voltage anywhere in the range of 90 to 260 VAC. The line <b>552</b> and neutral <b>554</b> feed the 240 VAC into a mains part <b>556</b>. It is worth noting that the system <b>550</b> does not include or provide a protective earth conductor.</p>
  <p num="p-0310">The mains part <b>556</b> feeds 240 VAC to a power supply printed circuit board (“PCB”) <b>558</b>. Power supply PCB <b>558</b> includes a mains part <b>562</b> and a live part <b>564</b>. For purposes of the present invention, a “mains part” is the entirety of all parts of a piece of equipment intended to have a conductive connection with the supply mains voltage. A “live part” is any part that if a connection is made to the part, the part can cause a current exceeding the allowable leakage current for the part concerned to flow from that part to earth or from that part to an accessible part of the same equipment.</p>
  <p num="p-0311">As illustrated, the live parts <b>560</b> and <b>564</b> step down in voltage from the mains parts <b>556</b> and <b>562</b>, respectively, to 24 VDC. Obviously, the voltage may be stepped down to other desired levels. Live part <b>560</b> feeds live part <b>566</b>. Live part <b>566</b> is an inverter having a step-up transformer that outputs a voltage of 1200 V<sub>peak</sub>. The inverter <b>566</b> powers a number of cathode fluorescent lights, which provide backlighting for the display device <b>40</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0312">Live part <b>560</b> is also electrically isolated from applied part <b>568</b>, which is maintained at a zero potential. An “applied part” for purposes of the present invention is any part of the system <b>550</b> that: (i) comes into physical contact with the patient or operator performing the dialysis treatment; (ii) can be brought into contact with the patient or operator; or (iii) needs to be touched by the patient. For instance, it is possible for the patient to touch the upper or lower plates of the plate heater <b>16</b>, the temperature sensors <b>62</b> and the enclosure or housing <b>112</b>. The applied part <b>568</b> represents schematically the casing or insulation around the temperature sensors <b>62</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0313">In an embodiment, which only includes a display device <b>40</b> and not a touch screen <b>42</b> (discussed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>), the housing <b>112</b> includes a window <b>570</b>, such as a glass or clear plastic window. The glass or plastic window provides the same level of insulation as the rest of the, e.g., plastic housing or enclosure <b>112</b>. In an embodiment which does include a touch screen <b>42</b>, the touch screen is properly electrically insulated, preferably by the manufacturer of same. Alternatively, one or more layers of insulation discussed below could be added to system <b>550</b> to properly insulate the touch screen <b>42</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0314">The system <b>550</b> makes available an input/output port <b>572</b>, which can be a serial port or an Ethernet port to connect the system <b>550</b> to an external computer, a local area network, a wide area network, an internet and the like. To electrically insulate input/output port <b>572</b>, the system provides a protective covering or casing <b>574</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0315">The mains part <b>556</b> powers the heater element <b>576</b>, which is positioned and arranged to heat both the upper and lower plates of the plate heater <b>16</b>. In an alternative embodiment (not illustrated), the mains part <b>556</b> powers the infrared heater discussed above. As illustrated, double insulation is maintained between the heater element <b>576</b> and the heater plate <b>16</b>. The double insulation includes basic insulation B(240), rated for 240 VAC, and supplemental insulation S(240), rated for 240 VAC.</p>
  <p num="p-0316">For the heater plate <b>16</b> and element <b>576</b>, at least, the basic and supplemental insulation needs to be electrically insulative but thermally conductive. Polyimides, such as a Kapton®, work very well. In an embodiment, therefore, the B(240) and S(240) layers each include Kapton® tape or sheet of about 0.3 millimeters thickness. As further illustrated, another layer of basic insulation B(240), rated for 240 VAC, and another layer of supplemental insulation S(240), rated for 240 VAC, are disposed between the temperature sensor <b>62</b> and the heater plate <b>16</b>. Thus the heater plate <b>16</b> is completely and doubly insulated from the remainder of the system <b>550</b>. Alternatively, either of the double layers of insulation can be replaced by a single layer of reinforced insulation.</p>
  <p num="p-0317">The line <b>552</b> and the neutral <b>554</b> are insulated by basic operation insulation BOP (240), rated for 240 VAC, which is the electrical insulation wrapped or extruded around the respective wires. Basic insulation B(240), rated for 240 VAC, is provided between the mains part <b>556</b> and the enclosure <b>112</b> and between the power supply PCB <b>558</b> and the enclosure. The basic insulation B(240) can be in the form of a properly separated air gap. The enclosure <b>112</b> itself provides supplemental insulation S(240) for 240 VAC. The mains part <b>556</b> is therefore doubly insulated from the outside of the enclosure <b>112</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0318">Since applied part <b>568</b> is maintained at a zero operating voltage, there needs to be no additional insulation placed between the applied part <b>568</b> and the housing <b>112</b>. Accordingly, there is simply an operational separation displayed figuratively as OP between the applied part <b>568</b> and the housing <b>112</b>. Double insulation or reinforced insulation D/R (24) for 24 VDC is however provided between live part <b>560</b> and the applied part <b>568</b>, so that applied part <b>568</b> maintains its zero potential. Basic insulation B(24), rated for 24 VDC, is provided between live part <b>560</b> and the enclosure <b>112</b>. The basic insulation B(24) can be in the form of a properly separated air gap. As stated above, the enclosure <b>112</b> itself provides supplemental insulation S(240) for 240 VAC. Live part <b>560</b> is therefore doubly insulated from the outside of the enclosure <b>112</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0319">No additional insulation is needed and only an operational separation OP is provided between live part <b>560</b> and the live part <b>566</b>. Since live part <b>566</b> is stepped up to 1200 V<sub>peak</sub>, the supplemental insulation S(240) rated for only 240 VAC of the enclosure <b>112</b> should not be relied upon. Accordingly, double insulation or reinforced insulation D/R (1200) for 1200 T<sub>peak </sub>is provided between the live part <b>566</b> and the housing <b>112</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0320">Double insulation or reinforced insulation D/R (240) for 240 VAC is provided between the mains part <b>556</b> and the live part <b>560</b>. Double insulation or reinforced insulation D/R (240) for 240 VAC is also provided between the line and neutral line <b>554</b> and the upper and lower plates of plate heater <b>16</b>. Still further, double insulation or reinforced insulation D/R (240) for 240 VAC is provided between the mains part <b>562</b> and the live part <b>564</b> of the power supply PCB <b>558</b>. Here, in the case of double insulation, either the basic or supplementary insulation can be a properly separated creepage distance on the PCB <b>558</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0321">Double insulation or reinforced insulation D/R (24) for 24 VDC is provided between the housing <b>112</b> and the display device <b>40</b>. The separation between the display device <b>40</b>, maintained at 24 VDC and the inverter, maintained at 1200 V<sub>peak </sub>is only required to be operational. Live part <b>566</b> must be separated from the outside of the housing <b>112</b> by D/R(1200) but not from the LP(24). The reason is that the LP(1200) is on the secondary side of the live part <b>566</b> and if it is shorted to the LP(<b>24</b>) due to a failure of the operational insulation, LP(<b>1200</b>) will become at most 24 VDC, providing no safety hazard.</p>
  <heading>X. Graphical User Interface</heading> <p num="p-0322">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, one embodiment of a graphical user interface (“GUI”) system <b>600</b> is illustrated. The GUI system <b>600</b> in an embodiment employs web-based software as well as other types of software. As discussed previously in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> of the present invention is provided with an input/output (e.g., serial or Ethernet) port <b>572</b>, which is normally insulated from the patient by a cover <b>574</b>. The port <b>572</b> allows the controller <b>30</b> of the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> to access an internet and a variety of other networks. The GUI system <b>600</b> of the present invention takes advantage of this capability by enabling the controller <b>30</b> to interact with software on an internet or other network.</p>
  <p num="p-0323">It should be appreciated that the GUI system <b>600</b> does not require the patient to have internet or network access in their home. Rather, the port <b>572</b> is for a maintenance person or installer to gain access to the controller <b>30</b> within the hardware unit <b>110</b>. In this manner, the patient may bring their unit to a place having internet or network access, wherein the patient's software may be upgraded. The patient may then bring the unit home and operate it without having to gain internet or network access.</p>
  <p num="p-0324">Using web-based software is advantageous because it is based on well established standards, so that the interface screens may be constructed using existing software components as opposed to being hand crafted. Web-based software allows for external communication and multiple access points. The software is portable. For each of these reasons, software constructed using existing software components reduces development time and cost.</p>
  <p num="p-0325">The present invention includes the construction of a GUI using an embedded web browser <b>602</b>. In an embodiment, the embedded web browser <b>602</b> is third party software. The embedded web browser <b>602</b> can include any third party browser that runs on a target platform and includes support for advanced features such as HTML 4.0, ECMAScript, and animated GIFs. The web browser <b>602</b> renders and supplies the various GUI screens to the video monitor <b>40</b>. The web browser <b>602</b> also handles inputs made by the patient. When the operator interacts with the system (e.g., presses buttons <b>43</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>125</b> and <b>127</b> or turns knob <b>122</b>, illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>), the web browser <b>602</b> forwards information about the interaction to the embedded web server <b>604</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0326">The web server <b>604</b> in turn uses a web server extension software <b>606</b> to process the interaction. The embedded web server <b>604</b> can also be any third party web server that runs on a target platform and includes support for the web server extension software <b>606</b> and that allows a dynamic definition of the information to be sent to the embedded web browser <b>602</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0327">The web server extensions are developed internally using the web server extension software <b>606</b> and conform to the specification of a mechanism, such as a Servlet, which works in conjunction with the chosen embedded web server <b>604</b>. The web server extension software <b>606</b> enables the web server <b>604</b> to retrieve back end and real time information from the instrument access and control software <b>608</b>. There are a number of different existing web server extension technologies that may be used for the embedded web browser <b>602</b>, the embedded web server <b>604</b> and the web server extension software <b>606</b>, such as CGI, ASP, Servlets or Java Server Pages (“JSP”).</p>
  <p num="p-0328">The web server extension software <b>606</b> interacts with the instrument access and control software <b>608</b>. The instrument access and control software <b>608</b> is an internally developed operating environment for controlling the various lower level components of the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b>, such as the valve motor/actuator, pump motor/actuator and heater.</p>
  <p num="p-0329">Depending on the operator input and the state of the automated dialysis system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b>, the web server extension software <b>606</b> can interact with the instrument access and control software <b>608</b> to obtain information from same and to cause one of the devices of the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> to take action. The web server extension software <b>606</b> then sends information to the embedded web browser <b>602</b>, which may then be displayed on the display device <b>40</b>. The web server extension software <b>606</b> communicates with the instrument access and control software <b>608</b> using, in an embodiment, the CORBA standard. This communication, however, may take place using various different protocols known to those of skill in the art.</p>
  <p num="p-0330">During the operation of the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b>, an event may occur that requires high priority information to be displayed to the operator, for example, an alarm and corresponding message either on the display device <b>40</b> or on a separate dedicated alarm display. When a high priority event occurs, the instrument access and control software <b>608</b> generates an event that is handled by an event-handling software <b>610</b>, which can be developed internally. The event-handing software <b>610</b> in turn notifies the embedded web browser <b>602</b>, through the use of a plug-in or a refresh request simulation from the web server <b>604</b>, to refresh whatever display the web browser is currently causing to be displayed on display device <b>40</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0331">The event-handing software <b>610</b> enables information to flow from the instrument access and control software <b>608</b> to the embedded web browser <b>602</b> without a request by the embedded web browser <b>602</b>, wherein the web browser thereafter requests a refresh. The web server <b>604</b> then forwards the request to the web server extension software <b>606</b>. The web server extension software <b>606</b> determines what information should be displayed on the display device <b>40</b> based on the state of the system <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>. The web server extension software <b>606</b> then relays that information back to the embedded web browser <b>602</b>, which updates the display device, e.g., to show an alarm condition.</p>
  <p num="p-0332">In one embodiment of the GUI system <b>600</b>, the web client is internal to the hardware unit <b>110</b> of the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b>. As described above in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the controller <b>10</b> includes a plurality of processors (referred to collectively herein as processor <b>34</b>). A main microprocessor is provided that resides over a number of delegate processors. Each of the embedded web browser <b>602</b>, web server <b>604</b>, web server extension software <b>606</b> and event handling software <b>610</b> run on the main microprocessor. The instrument access and control software <b>608</b> runs on the main microprocessor and one or more of the delegate processors.</p>
  <p num="p-0333">It is alternatively possible that a number of different external web clients may need to access information contained within the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b>. It is therefore preferred that the HTTP commands to the embedded web server <b>604</b> not require predetermined passwords, but instead use a stronger and more flexible security system.</p>
  <p num="p-0334">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30A-30M</figref>, a number of screen shots of the GUI <b>600</b> are illustrated that show the overall look and feel of the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> as seen by the operator or patient. Further, these drawings illustrate various features provided by the GUI system <b>600</b>. The goal of the automated dialysis system of the present invention is to make a simple and well operating system. The device only requires two supply bags <b>14</b>, weighs less than 10 kg and can be powered virtually anywhere in the world without the risk of electrical shock to the patient. Similarly, the GUI system <b>600</b> is designed to be simple, intuitive, effective, repeatable and reliable.</p>
  <p num="p-0335">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> includes a display device <b>40</b>, a knob <b>122</b> that enables the user to interact with the GUI system <b>600</b> and a number of dedicated pushbuttons <b>43</b> that enable the patient to navigate between three different screens namely a parameter change screen, a log screen and a therapy screen. In an embodiment, a display device <b>40</b> is provided, wherein the input devices <b>43</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>125</b> and <b>127</b> are each electromechanical. In an alternative embodiment, one or more of the input devices are provided by a touch screen <b>42</b> that operates with the display device <b>40</b> and a video controller <b>38</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0336">A simulated or electromechanical “stop” input <b>124</b>, an “OK” button <b>125</b> and a “back” button <b>127</b> are also provided. The OK button <b>125</b> enables the operator to indicate that a particular part of the set-up procedure has been completed and to prompt the GUI <b>600</b> to move on to a next step of the set-up stage or to the therapy stage. The stop button <b>124</b> enables the operator or patient to stop the set-up or therapy procedures. The system <b>600</b> may include a handshake type of response, such as “are you sure you want to stop the set-up”. Other parts of the entire procedure, such as the patient fill or drain cycles immediately stop without further input from the operator. At certain points in the procedure, the system enables the operator to move back one or more screens using the back button <b>127</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0337">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30A</figref>, the display device <b>40</b> and the video controller <b>38</b> are adaptable to display animations, which provide the patient with information and instructions <b>612</b> in a comfortable format. As illustrated throughout the screen shots, the GUI system <b>600</b> waits for the patient to read and understand whatever is being displayed on the display device <b>40</b> before moving on to the next step or stage. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30A</figref> illustrates that the GUI system <b>600</b> is waiting until the patient is ready before beginning the therapy. The system <b>600</b> prompts the user to press an “OK” input to begin the therapy. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30A</figref> also illustrates that the therapy screen is being presently displayed by highlighting the word “therapy” at <b>614</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0338">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30B</figref>, the display device <b>40</b> of the GUI system <b>600</b> prompts the patient to gather the necessary supplies for the therapy, such as the supply bags <b>14</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30B and 30C</figref> illustrate that the system <b>600</b> uses static images, such as static image <b>616</b> and animations, such as animation <b>618</b>, which resemble the actual corresponding supplies or parts to aid the patient in easily, effectively and safely connecting to the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b>. For example, the animation <b>618</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30C</figref> looks like the actual hose clamp of the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b>, which aids the patient in finding the proper piece of equipment to proceed with the therapy. The arrow of the animation <b>618</b> also illustrates the action that the patient is supposed to perform, reducing the risk that the patient will improperly maneuver the clamp or perhaps break the clamp.</p>
  <p num="p-0339"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30D and 30E</figref> illustrate that the GUI system <b>600</b> promotes hygienic operation of the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> by prompting the patient to: (i) take the steps of covering the patient's mouth and nose at the proper time; and (ii) wash the patient's hands before coming into contact with critical fluid connectors, such as the patient fluid connector and the supply bag connectors. The GUI system <b>600</b> waits for the patient to finish and press an OK input at each step before proceeding to the next step. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30D and 30E</figref>, software LEDs <b>620</b> located at the top of the display device <b>40</b> indicate where the user is in the setup procedure.</p>
  <p num="p-0340">Screen shots of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30A to 30E</figref> and <b>30</b>H to <b>30</b>M each present procedural set-up steps of the therapy. Accordingly, the colors of the screen shots of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30A to 30E</figref> and <b>30</b>H to <b>30</b>M are chosen so that they are more visible when viewed during the day or with lights on. In one embodiment, the screens are different shades of blue, wherein the static images and animations and inner lettering are white and the outer lettering and borders are black. As illustrated by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30F and 30G</figref> however, the screen shots that illustrate the active stages of the therapy are chosen so that they are more visible when viewed at night or with lights off. In one embodiment, the screen shots of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30A to 30F</figref> are black with ruby red lettering, diagrams and illustrations, etc. The red letting is configured so as not to be intrusive to a sleeping patient but still visible at distances of about 10 to 25 feet (3 to 7.6 meters).</p>
  <p num="p-0341"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30F and 30G</figref> illustrate that during active stages of the therapy, the therapy status information is displayed on the screen shots in the form of both graphics <b>622</b> and numerical data <b>624</b>. Therapy status information is displayed in real time or in substantially real time with a slight time delay. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30F</figref> illustrates a screen shot during a fill portion of the therapy. In particular, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30F</figref> illustrates the first fill of three total fills. The graphical clock <b>622</b> illustrates that the fill cycle time is approximately ⅛th elapsed. The arrow graphic <b>622</b> indicates that the therapy is in a fill cycle. Also the graphical representation of the body <b>622</b> has a very low percentage of dialysate. The numerical data <b>624</b> illustrates that the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> has pumped 150 ml of dialysate into the patient.</p>
  <p num="p-0342"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3G</figref> illustrates that the patient is currently undergoing the first drain cycle of three drain cycles that will take place overnight. The graphical representation of the clock illustrates that the drain cycle time is approximately ⅛th elapsed. The graphical arrow is pointing downward indicating a drain cycle. The body is shown as being substantially full of dialysate. The numerical data <b>624</b> illustrates that 50 ml of dialysate has been removed from the patient.</p>
  <p num="p-0343"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30H and 30I</figref> illustrate that in the morning when the therapy is complete, the screen reverts back to the daytime colors, or colors which are more easily seen in a lighted room. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30H</figref> includes information and instructions <b>612</b> that prompt the patient to disconnect from the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b>. The system waits for the patient to select the OK button <b>125</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) before proceeding. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 301</figref> includes an animation <b>618</b>, which illustrates an action and equipment that the patient while disconnecting from the system. For each action in the disconnection sequence, system <b>600</b> waits for the patient to select the OK button <b>125</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) before proceeding.</p>
  <p num="p-0344"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30J to 30M</figref> illustrate that in an embodiment, the user navigates between the therapy, parameter changes and log information by selecting one of the dedicated inputs <b>43</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30J</figref> illustrates that the patient has selected the input <b>43</b> associated with the parameter changes information. The screen <b>40</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30J</figref> now highlights the word “changes” instead of the word “therapy.”</p>
  <p num="p-0345">The parameter screen presents parameter information to the patient in a hierarchy format. First, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30J</figref>, the system <b>600</b> presents categories <b>625</b> of parameters, such as patient preferences, daily patient data, therapy parameters, nurse parameters and service parameters. The patient can scroll through the various categories <b>625</b> using the adjustment knob <b>122</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, so that a desired category <b>625</b> is displayed in a highlighted display area <b>626</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30H</figref> illustrates that the patient preferences category <b>625</b> is currently displayed in the highlighted display area <b>626</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0346">Once the user selects a highlighted category <b>625</b> by pressing the OK button <b>125</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>), a first door <b>628</b> slides open and presents the user with a list of the parameters <b>627</b> for the selected category <b>625</b> (e.g., the patient preferences category), as illustrated by the screen <b>40</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30K</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30K</figref> illustrates that the patient preferences category <b>625</b> is displayed above the door <b>628</b>, so that the patient knows which category <b>625</b> of parameters <b>627</b> is being displayed. At the same time, the highlighted display area <b>626</b> now displays one of a select group of the parameters <b>627</b> belonging to the patient preferences category <b>625</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0347">The parameters <b>627</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30K</figref> as belonging to the patient preferences category <b>625</b> include a display brightness percent, a speaker volume percent and a dialysate temperature in degree Celsius. Obviously, the patient preferences category <b>625</b> may include other parameters <b>627</b>. The other categories <b>625</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30J</figref> include different parameters <b>627</b> than those illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30K</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0348">The patient can scroll through and select one of the parameters <b>627</b> for the patient preferences category <b>625</b> by rotating knob <b>122</b>. In this manner, it should be appreciated that the signal knob <b>122</b> is used over and over again. This feature is in accordance with the goal of providing a simple system, wherein the patient only has to turn one knob instead of remembering which knob from a plurality of knobs applies to a particular feature. The knob <b>122</b> also enables the lettering to be bigger because the patient can scroll through to see additional parameter selections that are not displayed when the door <b>628</b> is initially displayed. That is, the functionality of the knob <b>122</b> provides freedom to the GUI <b>600</b> to not have to display all the possible parameters at once. It should be appreciated that this benefit also applies to the category selection screen of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30J</figref>, wherein each of the categories <b>625</b> does not have to be displayed simultaneously.</p>
  <p num="p-0349">Once the patient selects one of the parameters of the patient preferences category, e.g., by pressing the OK button <b>125</b>, a second door <b>630</b> slides open, wherein the display device <b>40</b> illustrates that the patient has selected the display brightness parameter <b>627</b> of the patient preferences category <b>625</b>, which is still displayed by the first door <b>628</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30L</figref>. The highlighted area <b>626</b> now displays one of the range of possible values <b>632</b> for the selected parameter <b>627</b> of the selected category.</p>
  <p num="p-0350">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30L</figref> display device <b>40</b> illustrates that the highlighted display area <b>626</b> currently shows a value <b>632</b> of eighty for the display brightness parameter <b>627</b> of the patient preferences category. Once again, the patient changes the value <b>632</b> of the selected parameter <b>627</b> by rotating the knob <b>122</b>. When the patient selects a value <b>632</b> (by pressing the OK input <b>125</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> while the desired value is displayed) for the parameter of the chosen category, the GUI system <b>600</b> saves the value as indicated by the display device <b>40</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30M</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30M</figref> illustrates that the system <b>600</b> provides a feedback message to the patient that the selected value has been saved.</p>
  <p num="p-0351">The system <b>600</b> in an embodiment presents information and instructions to the operator through the various visual tools discussed above. In an alternative embodiment, in addition to the visual information and instructions <b>612</b>, static images <b>616</b>, animations <b>618</b>, parameter information, etc., one, or more or all of the above disclosed methods of communication is presented audibly to the patient or operator through speakers <b>129</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) and a sound card (not illustrated) that cooperate with the controller <b>30</b> of the system <b>10</b>, <b>100</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0352">The various programs that run on the main microprocessor can also include one or more programs that activate a certain sound file at a certain time during the therapy or upon a certain event initiated by the system <b>600</b>, e.g., an alarm, or upon a patient or operator input. The sound files can contain the sound of a human voice or any other type of sound. The sound files walk the patient through the set-up portion of the therapy in an embodiment. The sound files can alert a patient who has made an inappropriate input into the GUI <b>600</b>, etc. The system does not activate a sound during the cycles, e.g., while the patient sleeps, in a preferred embodiment.</p>
  <p num="p-0353">If the operator selects the dedicated input <b>43</b> corresponding to the log information (not illustrated), the GUI <b>600</b> displays a screen or screens that show therapy data. In an embodiment, the therapy data is presented in a number of operator selectable logs. One of the logs can be a default log that is displayed initially, wherein the operator can switch to another log via, e.g., the knob <b>122</b>. The logs may pertain to the most recent therapy and/or can store data over a number of days and a number of therapies. The logs can store any type of operating parameter information such as cycle times, number of cycles, fluid volume delivered, fluid temperature information, fluid pressure information, concentration of dialysate constituents, any unusual or alarm type of events, etc.</p>
  <p num="p-0354">It should be understood that various changes and modifications to the presently preferred embodiments described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention and without diminishing its intended advantages. It is therefore intended that such changes and modifications be covered by the appended claims.</p>
