    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0002">This invention relates generally to the field of medical devices and, more particularly, to intravascular devices.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">A correlation exists between cardiac electrical abnormalities and coronary vascular abnormalities. These abnormalities often coexist with each other. For example, patients who receive an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) often also have coronary artery disease (CAD). Ischemia is associated with CAD. One definition of ischemia is a reduced blood flow or a localized tissue anemia due to obstruction of the inflow of arterial blood. Ischemia is capable of initiating electrical arrhythmias; and electrical abnormalities are capable of altering hemodynamics and compromising blood flow. Present therapies typically address one abnormality or the other despite this correlation between cardiac electrical abnormalities and coronary vascular abnormalities.</p>
    <p num="p-0004">Cardiac electrical abnormalities are addressed by cardiac stimulus devices such as pacemakers and ICDs. These cardiac stimulus devices monitor electrical activity and restore normal function by delivering pacing strength or defibrillation shock strength electrical pulses. These devices provide a sensing function by sensing the electrical function of the heart. That is, these devices are capable of sensing arrhythmias and intervening electrically. Most cardiac stimulus devices use intracavitary leads placed transvenously for sensing, pacing, and shocking. Now, leads are also being placed intravenously. However, conventional cardiac stimulus devices do not monitor the mechanical performance of the heart or otherwise provide a mechanical performance.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">Conventional pacemakers often include an electronics assembly housed in a hermetically sealed enclosure, and one or more leads which connect the pacer directly to the heart tissues to be stimulated and sensed. The electronics assembly is able to be implanted in a suitable area of the body, commonly the upper thorax, because of the length of the lead used, which may be 18 to 30 inches long, for example.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">One end of the lead connects to the pacer, while the other end of the lead, referred to as the “distal” end, is attached to an interior surface of one of the chambers of the heart, for example. One or more electrodes typically are disposed at the distal end of the lead through which electrical pulses are delivered to the heart at the site of the electrodes and/or from which sensing occurs. During implantation of conventional pacer systems, it is a common procedure for the physician to insert a stiff wire (“stylette”) through the center of the lead and then to “snake” the lead though a predetermined path to the heart. Often the leads are implanted by guiding them through blood vessels into one or more chambers of the heart. The leads typically pass through valves that separate the atrial from the ventricular chambers.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">Although leads have been used for many years in conjunction with implanted pacemakers and defibrillators both to stimulate the heart to beat as well as to sense the electrical activity of the heart, the use of leads is not problem free. For instance, the implantation avenues available for leads to be routed to and through the heart may be limited by the lumenal diameter of the vessels leading to the heart or by valves in the heart, and the ability to chronically fix the lead tends to be influenced by the anchorage available (e.g. trabeculas). Further, because the pressures in the right cardiac chambers are markedly lower than the pressures in the left cardiac chambers, it has been preferred to introduce leads into the right side of the heart because of the reduced risk of blood loss. Thus, for these practical reasons, a physician typically only implants the leads in a relatively few preselected sites in the heart. These sites, however, are not necessarily the optimal sites, but are chosen as a compromise between the complications described above and the patient's cardiac problem. Rather than monitoring the electrical activity in the right ventricle, monitoring the left ventricle's electrical activity, for example, might be preferred instead.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">Additionally, it is desired for some applications to sense electrical activity at three, four, or more sites in the heart. Some pacers are implanted with four leads permitting sensing at four different sites in the heart. Four leads tend to be difficult to implant as they occupy a relatively large volume in the blood vessels through which they are passed and sometimes have to be steered along circuitous routes. Further, it is becoming increasingly desirable to sense at more locations in or on the heart than is possible with conventional pacer-lead combinations. It would thus be highly beneficial to have a stimulation and sensing system that provides the diagnostic and therapeutic functions provided by conventional cardiac stimulators yet which employs fewer interconnecting leads, than required by conventional devices, or which can function without using any leads.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">U.S. Pat. No. 6,141,588, which issued to Cox et al. and is assigned to Intermedics, Inc., relates to a satellite pacing electrode system and is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. This satellite pacing electrode system is a system of remote electrodes that communicate with and are controlled by a central unit. The disclosed satellite pacing system uses epicardial electrodes that are in direct contact with myocardium. Epicardial placement of these electrodes at multiple sites often involves open-chest surgery. It would thus be highly beneficial to have a stimulation and sensing system that provides the diagnostic and therapeutic functions provided by epicardial electrodes of Cox et al., yet which involves less invasive surgery.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">Coronary vascular abnormalities are addressed by blood flow and blood pressure monitors and stents, for example. However, these device are unable to sense arrhythmias and electrically intervene. Catheter-based blood flow and pressure monitors presently exist for acute measurements. These monitors provide a sensing function by sensing the mechanical performance of the heart. Examples of these catheter-based monitors include Millar catheters, and Swann-Ganz catheters. However, these catheter-based devices cannot be used chronically; that is, they cannot be implanted and used for long durations. Metal stents are placed intravascularly to reopen arteries in balloon angioplasty operations. However, the function of conventional stents is to prevent restenosis, i.e. to prevent the arteries from narrowing or constricting again.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">Given the correlation between cardiac electrical abnormalities and coronary vascular abnormalities, it is desired to provide a chronically-implanted cardiac stimulus device with sensing capabilities to determine cardiac electrical abnormalities and coronary vascular abnormalities for improving arrhythmia therapy. More generally, it is desired to provide a chronically-implanted device that is capable of performing one or various combinations of mechanical, electrical, and chemical sensing and to provide a chronically-implanted device that is also capable of providing appropriate therapy, such as electrical or drug therapy, based on an event sensed by the chronically implanted device or by other devices within a system of devices. Additionally, there is a need to provide a chronically-implanted stimulus device that is capable of being implanted in a large number of desirable locations using less invasive procedures.</p>

According to other embodiments, biofuel cells are used to generate the power for the electrical therapy.</p>
    <p num="p-0132">Multi-site pacing using the chronically-implanted devices, particularly the intravascular stent-like device, provides a number of possibilities for electrical vectors between two or more chronically-implanted devices in a device-to-device electrical configuration, and between at least one chronically-implanted device and an external device or devices, such as a CAN of a pacemaker, in a device-to-can electrical configuration. Electrical vectors include both the magnitude and polarity of electrical pulses. According to various embodiments, the number and locality of the chronically-implanted devices are chosen so as to be able to reduce the magnitude of the electrical pulses and still provide effective, electrical therapy.</p>
    <p num="h-0009">Sensing Function.</p>
    <p num="p-0133">Various embodiments of the chronically-implanted device include sensors, as well as associated circuitry for performing analysis on sensed data, that are capable of sensing one or more mechanical events or conditions, one or more electrical events or conditions, and/or one or more chemical events or conditions. Sensors, as categorized by transducer type, include pressure-based sensors such as piezoelectric crystals and capacitive membrane sensors, electrical-based sensors such as potentiometric and amperometric sensors, electrical-chemical based sensors, biochemical-based sensors, magnetic-based sensors, temperature-based sensors, mechanical-based sensors, gravimetric or accelerometer sensors, and optical-based sensors such as oxygen sensors for measuring oxygen saturation or percent oxygen. The following provides examples of sensors. These examples are not intended to be an exclusive listing, and as such should not be read to limit the type of sensors encompassed in the present subject matter.</p>
    <p num="p-0134">Piezoelectric crystals are capable of measuring blood pressure by converting blood pressure into an electrical potential, and of being used to derive a blood flow measurement using the measured blood pressure and time. Piezoelectric crystals sense a change in a mechanical-to-electrical transduction. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15–17</figref> illustrate blood flow (α), blood pressure (β), and electrical potential (E) for a given blood flow and pressure. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a graph illustrating blood flow (α) as derived from time and sensor readings of pressure. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a graph illustrating blood pressure (β) as determined by sensor readings. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a graph illustrating electrical potential (E) as determined by sensor readings, which corresponds to blood flow and blood pressure readings. It is noted that all of the waveforms are scaled versions of each other. According to various embodiments, piezoelectric crystals are used to indicate restenosis, artery occlusion or first time stenosis, and blood pressure for cardiac output function.</p>
    <p num="p-0135">Capacitive membrane sensors, like piezoelectric crystals, are capable of measuring blood pressure by converting blood pressure into an electrical potential, and are capable of being used to derive a blood flow measurement using the measured blood pressure and time. Capacitive membrane sensors operate to sense a change in capacitance. According to one embodiment, a capacitive membrane sensor is used to sense rate. In this rate-sensing embodiment, the required resolution is not as high as is required for sensing blood pressure and/or blood flow. The rate-sensing embodiment provides a mechanical rate indicator of the pulsing blood versus an electrical rate indicator of the local cell depolarization. According to one embodiment, a capacitive membrane sensor is used in conjunction with an electrically-based rate indicator to determine if a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) or electro mechanical disassociation (EMD) has occurred by monitoring the cardiac output via the pressure measurement or by measuring the area under the curve to determine the cardiac output/stroke volume measurement.</p>
    <p num="p-0136"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> are graphs illustrating blood flow, as derived from sensor readings of pressure, wherein the area under the curve represents a cardiac output/stroke volume measurement and the width and height of pulses represent contraction speed and peak pressure. The area under the curve in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> may be the same as the area of the curve in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. However, the speed of contraction and the peak pressure can be significantly different.</p>
    <p num="p-0137">One embodiment of the chronically-implanted devices uses the capacitive membrane as a hemodynamic sensor. For example, if the overall volume pumped through is the same during ventricular tachycardia (VT) as in a normal sinus rhythm (NSR), and the measured pulses are periodic, then the VT may be considered hemodynamically tolerable.</p>
    <p num="p-0138">Oxygen sensors have been included previously in pacing leads. Measuring the amount of oxygen in the blood may be used to determine rate parameters, i.e., rate adaption. Oxygen sensors tend to suffer from coagulation on the detector and/or emitter. According to one embodiment, if suffering from coagulation, the oxygen sensor itself serves as a measure of intra vessel coagulation rate.</p>
    <p num="p-0139">Oxygen saturation is the amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin in the blood. Oxygen saturation is expressed as a percentage of the maximum binding capacity. Optical techniques are the most common methods used to measure oxygen saturation in vivo. One embodiment of the chronically-implanted device includes a sensor for measuring oxygen saturation. According to one embodiment, the chronically-implanted device that includes a sensor for measuring oxygen saturation is positioned to measure oxygen on the venous side of the heart.</p>
    <p num="p-0140">According to one embodiment, an impedance sensor measures the inner diameter of a vessel wall to either monitor the progression or to prevent stenosis or restenosis. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates one embodiment of an impedance sensor <b>2068</b> attached to an intravascular stent <b>2000</b>. A current is injected and the resulting voltage is measured. Impedance is calculated from the known current and voltage. The resistivity (ρ) of blood is generally constant for a particular patient, and is provided by resistance per unit length (kΩ/cm). Therefore, a change in impedance reflects a change in the inner wall diameter, as provided by the equation:
<br> <i>ΔR</i>=[ρblood]×[ΔCM].<br>
The change in impedance may be caused by local coagulation/fibrosis around the device and/or electrodes over periods of time. One application uses the impedance sensor in conjunction with the piezoelectric crystal and/or capacitive membrane to monitor coagulation/fibrosis build-up. That is, typically the degradation of the impedance signal suggests restenosis since the diameter is decreasing. However, restenosis has not occurred if the blood pressure and/or blood flow as sensed by the piezoelectric crystal and/or capacitive membrane show no degradation. Rather, it is determined that coagulation and/or fibrosis has corrupted impedance-sensing electrodes.

Drug-Eluting Function.
</p>
    <p num="p-0141">MIT has presented findings related to uncapping a closed planar reservoir to deliver a drug contained within the reservoir. One embodiment of the chronically-invasive device, and in particular the intravascular device, uses such a reservoir to release drugs directly into the vascular system.</p>
    <p num="p-0142">One embodiment of the chronically-implanted device carries the drug between a substructure and an electro-erodible overcoat layer; and another embodiment of the chronically-implanted device carries the drug using a drug delivery “chip” that is separately prepared and subsequently attached to the device. The drug is released from the drug delivery chip through an electro-erodible release mechanism. Progressive drug release is provided by wells or regions that are selectively opened by explicitly addressing a given well or region, or by a more generalized progressive erosion of a tapered thickness electro-erodible overcoat layer.</p>
    <p num="p-0143">In one embodiment, the erosion process is open-loop where a well understood time-erosion behavior is known. In another embodiment, the erosion process is closed-loop where the erosion progress is monitored using the known relationship among current, voltage and erosion profile. Either process provides control of the eroded capping layer and consequent drug release.</p>
    <p num="p-0144">According to one embodiment of the chronically-implanted device, a stent is formed from a malleable, expandable, and substantially cylindrical mesh of biocompatible material. The construction of the stent includes at least one full length or truncated longitudinal region of non-mesh construction. A drug release chip is bonded to a longitudinal region of the stent or a similar longitudinal region of the base stent material that has been suitably prepared as a substrate for further drug-release construction. The stent structure is placed in a vascular region using conventional means known to one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
    <p num="p-0145">One embodiment of the drug release chip includes an array of well-like structures constructed so as to laterally isolate one well from another well so that one well is able to be selectively exposed using an electro-erodible process, for example, to deliver a specific drug type and drug dose. An electrically insulating layer covers the well(s) and the surrounding regions. One or more drugs are contained within the well(s). A cap layer of electro-erodible material covers the well(s). The electro-erodible material is non-toxic to the host biosystem both before and after electro-erosion. One example of an electro-erodible material is gold.</p>
    <p num="p-0146">In one embodiment, the connections and cap layer are patterned to allow individual well caps to be selected for electro-erosion using addressing logic. An electrically insulating, passivation covering insulates all interconnections except the intended electro-erosion region over and perhaps immediately around the drug release well. Alternatively, one or more thickness-graded capping layer(s) are selectively and progressively electro-eroded resulting in controlled progressive exposure of wells in the thinner capped region first. In various embodiments, a current, for a voltage-activated electro-erosion process, or a developed potential, for a current-activated electro-erosion process, are monitored to control the electro-erosion process.</p>
    <p num="p-0147">The drug-eluting device includes a controlled activation that is powered either by a controlled power source or by a self-contained power system. The controller power source is similar to that used in pacemaker technology, such as a battery contained in a hermetic biocompatible enclosure. The electrical connection between the drug release chip and the power source pierces the containing vessel and is sealed using conventional transvenous sealing technology. The self-contained power system includes an encapsulated electrochemical or other energy source, and environmental energy such as a biofuel.</p>

In the illustrated electrode configuration, there are five sets of one well, five sets of five wells and two sets of two wells. The different sized sets provide different delivery dosages.

Additionally, different drug types are able to be stored in the different sets of wells, such that a desired drug among several is able to be dispensed upon the detection of a particular event.</p>
    <p num="h-0010">Satellite-Planet Configuration.</p>
    <p num="p-0152">According to one embodiment, the chronically-implanted device is incorporated as one or more satellites in a satellite-planet configuration. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> illustrates an implantable medical device network including a planet <b>2592</b> and a plurality of satellites <b>2594</b> formed by the chronically-implanted device. The planet <b>2592</b> provides one example of an external device as illustrated and described with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–3</figref>. The satellites are shown proximate to a heart <b>2546</b>. The satellites are capable of being placed throughout a biosystem according the desired application.</p>
    <p num="p-0153">In general, the planet is implanted or externally retained. The planet is capable of wirelessly communicating, i.e. without a direct electrical connection, to each satellite, or is capable of being tethered to each satellite. The planet individually commands each satellite to provide sensing functions and therapy functions such as delivering electrical pulses or drugs. In another embodiment, the satellites function autonomously with respect and are in communication with the planet. This communication is initiated by the planet and/or by the satellite in various embodiments. Additionally, each satellite is capable of determining when a sense event has occurred, along with an identifying code indicating to the planet which satellite detected the sense event. In one embodiment, the planet processes the encoded signals received from the network of satellites, assigns time values to each satellite when that satellite detects a sense event, compares the time values to a template of normal time values, and determines if a therapy should be applied. Further, the planet selects and applies the appropriate therapy for the sensed event. According to one embodiment, the satellites derive their needed power from signals received from the planet via the wireless communication path or through a tether. In various embodiments, the satellites are self-powered using a battery or biofuel cells. In one embodiment, the planet is programmable using an external programmer unit <b>2596</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0154"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> is a block diagram illustrating the interconnection between the various components and circuitry for one embodiment of the planet of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. The planet <b>2692</b> generally includes a receiver data decoder <b>2611</b>, a sensor or sensors <b>2613</b>, a non-volatile memory (e.g. ROM) <b>2615</b>, a volatile memory (e.g. RAM) <b>2617</b>, a battery and supply regulator <b>2619</b>, a command/message encoder <b>2621</b>, a transceiver <b>2623</b>, an antenna <b>2625</b>, and a central processing unit (CPU) <b>2629</b>. This embodiment of the planet also includes a clock generator <b>2631</b> that provides a periodic timing signal to a counter <b>2633</b> which may be included as part of the CPU. Other components may be included in planet as desired.</p>
    <p num="p-0155">The CPU preferably includes any suitable type of commercially available processor or may be a custom design. The CPU controls the operation of planet. Generally, the CPU processes data received from the satellites via the transceiver and antenna, and receiver data decoder. The CPU also initiates the transmission of commands to each satellite individually by conveying a message to the command/message encoder which, in turn, provides an encoded message to be transmitted through antenna via transceiver. The CPU also receives inputs from the sensor, ROM, RAM, and clock. The non-volatile memory is used to store configuration and program code for execution by the CPU. Volatile memory (RAM) is used as “scratch-pad” memory for storing data used by the CPU.</p>
    <p num="p-0156">The battery and supply regulator preferably provides electrical power for the circuitry of the planet. The construction of the battery preferably uses a chemistry known to one skilled in the art. For example, the battery may include a disposable lithium iodide cell, but may employ rechargeable cells as well. The use of a rechargeable battery permits the planet's size to be smaller than if a non-rechargeable battery is used because a rechargeable battery need not hold as much charges as a disposable battery. A rechargeable battery, however, requires periodic recharging by an external device. An exemplary rechargeable battery may employ a lithium-ion chemistry. If a rechargeable battery is used, the planet preferably includes a coil or wire to capture inductively-coupled energy from an external device. As previously described with respect to the chronically-implanted device, other power generators, such as biofuel cells, may be used to power the planet.</p>
    <p num="p-0157">In one embodiment, the satellites transmit signals via wireless communication links to the planet. The transmitted signals are detected by the planet's antenna and demodulated in transceiver. The antenna preferably includes a coil of wire, parallel plates, dipoles or other suitable types of antennae to launch or capture electromagnetic energy. According to one embodiment, the satellites are a stent-like intravenous, chronically-implanted devices, and their antenna are formed by the stent-like device. According to other embodiments, the antenna is implemented as other types of transducers, such as ultrasonic (piezoelectric) devices. The transceiver includes modulators, demodulators and splitters for processing the signal from the antenna. The wireless communication technique is selected from any suitable technique.</p>
    <p num="p-0158">The output signal from the transceiver also is provided to the receiver data decoder. The demodulation method used by transceiver is appropriate for the communication methodology implemented via the pacer network for transmitting signals between satellites and the planet, such as frequency demodulation, amplitude demodulation or phase shift keying demodulation. The demodulated signal from transceiver is coded by receiver data decoder and provided in digital form to CPU over a digital bus.</p>
    <p num="p-0159">The master clock generates a periodic timing signal which is provided to counter. The counter may be included as part of the CPU or may be a discrete device coupled to the CPU. The counter counts cycles of the periodic timing signal generated by clock. The CPU can read the counter to determine the current count value. For example, if the clock signal is 1000 Hz and a counter counts 500 cycles of the clock signal, the CPU will know that the counter has counted for one-half of a second. In one embodiment, the counter preferably is implemented as a “count up” counter and a provides an output count value that begins with 0 and increments by 1 for each cycle of the periodic timing signal. Preferably the CPU is able to reset the counter to begin counting again from 0.</p>
    <p num="p-0160">In operation, each satellite in one embodiment transmits a signal to the planet when the satellite detects a sense event. According to various other embodiments, each satellite is adapted to autonomously sense continuously, periodically, or other method, and/or to sense on demand by the planet. The CPU uses the count value read from counter to determine when the sense event (reported by a satellite) has occurred during each cardiac cycle. Upon receiving a sense event signal from a satellite, the planet reads the current count elapsed since the counter was last reset. The CPU may have been programmed to reset the counter at or near the beginning of each cardiac cycle and thus, the count value read by the CPU is indicative of when the sense event occurred during the cardiac cycle. Alternatively, the count value may be latched in a register (not shown) while the counter continues.</p>
    <p num="p-0161"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> is a block diagram illustrating the interconnection between the various components and circuitry for one embodiment of a satellite of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. More than one satellite <b>2794</b> may be used in the satellite-planet configuration and each satellite is constructed the same or similar to the satellite depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. One satellite embodiment includes a pair of electrodes <b>2741</b>, a stimulus storage unit <b>2743</b>, a sensing amplifier and comparator logic <b>2745</b>, a sense event state storage and interface <b>2747</b>, a receiver data decoder/encoder <b>2749</b>, a transceiver <b>2751</b>, an antenna <b>2753</b>, a pump-rectifier <b>2755</b>, and a pump-regulator <b>2757</b>. According to various embodiments, the satellite is designed for mechanical, electrical and/or chemical sensing, and for mechanical, electrical and/or drug-eluting therapies.</p>
    <p num="p-0162">As described in more detail above, the electrical power for the satellite circuitry is provided by battery, by the biofuel cell, and/or by a wired or wireless connection to the planet or some other external device. In one embodiment, the electrical power is derived from the electromagnetic energy received from the planet. One embodiment uses some of the electromagnetic energy to recharge a battery in each satellite. In the illustrated embodiment, the transceiver and antenna receive electromagnetic energy from the planet on which encoded data is superimposed. The received energy is rectified by the pump-rectifier and regulated by the pump-regulator. The pump regulator uses the signal received from the antenna to supply a constant voltage to the other circuits of the satellite when the energy stored in the pump regulator has reached a threshold value. Alternatively, the pump-regulator may comprise a constant voltage reference device in order to stabilize sensing and stimulus storage.</p>
    <p num="p-0163">The pump-rectifier and pump regulator process the electromagnetic signal normally received by the antenna. Thus, the signal received from the planet serves to transfer commands and configuration data and to transfer energy for powering the satellites's electronics. Accordingly, even if the planet does not need to communicate commands or configuration data to a satellite, it maybe desirable for the planet to transmit a signal to the satellite simply to keep the satellites'electronics active. Thus, according to one embodiment, the planet briefly communicates with each satellite in the network one at a time to ensure that all satellites are active.</p>
    <p num="h-0011">Illustrative Applications.</p>
    <p num="p-0164">The description that follows provides illustrative applications which use various aspects of the chronically-implanted device, including one or more of the following: mechanical sensing, electrical sensing, chemical sensing, mechanical therapy, electrical therapy, and drug-eluting/chemical therapy. These illustrative applications are provided as examples, and are not intended as an exclusive list of applications. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand, upon reading and comprehending this disclosure, how to incorporate the various functions of the device of the present subject matter to perform other desirable applications.</p>
    <p num="p-0165">One application involves sensing blood pressure, blood flow, and vessel diameter. In one embodiment, the chronically-implanted device is used in a system for detecting ischemia episodes, including silent ischemia. Silent ischemia is a condition in which the tissue become ischemic, but without any associated pain. The ischemia episodes are able to be detected acutely using these applications. In various embodiments, the chronically-implanted device is used in a system for monitoring stenosis and/or restenosis, for detecting cardiac function, for discriminating hemodynamically stable blood pressure and compromised blood pressure associated with a ventricular tachycardia (VT) or bradycardia event, and for detecting electro mechanical dissociation (EMD). EMD is a situation in which, for example, the electrical activity of the heart appears normal but in which the heart is not effectively pumping blood. In one embodiment, the chronically-implanted device is used in a system to measure reduced blood flow and vessel diameter to indicate an acute ischemic episode. Ischemia detection is useful for predicting and is a promising strategy for preventing ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. According to one embodiment, the chronically-implanted device continuously tests for silent ischemia, a condition in which patients suffer ischemia with no pain. The intravascular measurement of reduced blood flow is measured directly rather than the indirect, traditional electrical measurements.</p>
    <p num="p-0166">According to one aspect of the present invention, the chronically-implanted devices are used as vessel stents that function as arterial-based ischemic detectors for sensing closure of the vessels. CAD is prevalent among ICD patients, and may lead to ischemic episodes that precipitate VT/VF. One promising strategy for predicting certain VT/VF events and applying preventive therapy includes sensing these ischemic episodes. Stents are placed in vessels that have already exhibited levels of occlusion and are likely to exhibit future occlusion. According to one embodiment, detecting these changes provides a warning of ischemic onset independently or in conjunction with electrogram morphology. According to one embodiment, the resonance of the metal stents following an acoustic input depends on the surrounding blockage and/or blood flow.</p>
    <p num="p-0167">In one embodiment, the chronically-implanted device is used in a system to chronically measure reduced vessel diameter or blood flow to indicate a gradual restenosis of a vessel. This embodiment is a promising strategy for providing a beneficial warning and permitting a preventive, vascular intervention. This continuous monitoring for restenosis by the chronically-implanted device provides a beneficial warning for initiating preventive, vascular intervention, and reducing the number of patient follow-ups and/or angiograms through the continuous monitoring of restenosis.</p>
    <p num="p-0168">In one embodiment, the chronically-implanted device is used in a system for detecting reduced blood pressure to indicate compromised cardiac function in terms of contractility or ejection fraction and stroke volume. In one application, intravascular monitoring for reduced blood pressure is used to monitor heart failure patients and/or efficacy of heart failure therapy.</p>
    <p num="p-0169">In one embodiment, the chronically-implanted device is used in a system for detecting reduced blood pressure and/or reduced blood flow and for detecting electrically-determined rate information to discriminate between hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia (VT) and VT in which the blood pressure is compromised. Hemodynamically stable VT is an event in which a stimulation pulse may not be required, whereas VT in which the blood pressure is compromised is an event in which a stimulation shock is required. This discrimination capability reduces the number of inappropriate shocks. Additionally, in one embodiment, the intravascular device is used in a system for collecting multiple intravascular measurements to discriminate between regional ischemia and global ischemia, which provides an indication of a hemodynamically compromised VT.</p>
    <p num="p-0170">According to one sensor application, the flow and/or pressure within the vessel is measured, and a prophylactic device is inserted within the vessel at a strategic point to monitor several of its “downstream” vessels. For example, by placing such a device in the left interior descending artery, it is possible to detect occlusions in the artery as well as its branches.</p>
    <p num="p-0171">In one embodiment, the chronically-implanted device is used in a system for measuring intravascular pressure and for measuring electrical rates to indicate electromechanical dissociation or pulseless electrical stimulation/activation. Occasionally, following shocks to treat VF, little or no mechanical activity occurs, yet the intrinsic or paced electrical activity appears normal. Devices that rely on electrical sensors have difficulty recognizing this condition.</p>
    <p num="p-0172">One application involves providing electrical stimulus pulses. In one embodiment, the chronically-implanted device is used in a system for improving hemodynamics. For example, the system is used in heart failure patients to monitor hemodynamic parameters and to improve blood circulation or provide prevention therapies.</p>
    <p num="p-0173">According to one embodiment, the chronically-implanted device, or more particularly an intravascular device, is used in pacing applications. One advantage is that the implantation procedure is less invasive for a chronically-implanted device rather than other epicardial electrodes. Another advantage of intravascular pacing includes the increase in available numbers of pacing sites. Another advantage of intravascular pacing includes the increase in available locations for pacing sites. Multisite pacing is considered a promising strategy for improving arrhythmic management and prevention. Two particular embodiments are discussed below.</p>
    <p num="p-0174">According to one embodiment, multisite pacing is used as a strategy for improving hemodynamics. Bi-atrial pacing and, more recently, bi-ventricular pacing have been shown to improve cardiac function, especially in heart failure patients. A system according to the present invention, in which several electrodes are placed in one chamber and/or multiple chambers, is a strategy for improving the synchronization and cardiac output in a variety of disease settings.</p>
    <p num="p-0175">According to one embodiment, multisite pacing is used as a strategy for managing arrhythmia and/or preventing arrhythmia. For example, antitachycardia pacing (ATP) relies on pacing during the excitable gap to electrically capture or control a heart in sustained VT. It is noted here that one embodiment of the invention provides the ability to sense to determine the location of the excitable gap. The incorporation of more pacing sites provides greater control and more sophisticated ATP strategies. Furthermore, the ability to pace-capture a site during VF has been demonstrated. According to one embodiment, multisite pacing is used as a strategy to pace-capture the heart and/or chamber out of VF rather than to deliver a shock to bring the heart out of VF. According to other embodiments, multisite pacing, sub-threshold stimulation, or a combination thereof is used as a strategy for suppressing local arrhythmia or interrupting a developing re-entrant arrhythmia.</p>
    <p num="p-0176">One application involves sensing blood sugar levels, and maintaining the appropriate blood sugar levels by eluting an appropriate substance or substances to controllably raise or lower the blood sugar levels, as required.</p>
    <p num="p-0177">According to one embodiment, the chronically-implanted device functions as satellite and communicates to a planet. In a multisite embodiment, multiple intravascular devices are placed as satellites around and are in communication with the planet. According to one embodiment, the satellite intravascular devices are tethered to the planet using a thin connector running from each satellite device through the vessel and to the planet. In this embodiment, each satellite intravascular device functions as a tip, with all of the capabilities of a normal pacing lead tip. According to other embodiments, the satellite lead devices communicate with the planet using wireless techniques such as RF communication or ultrasonic communication or wired techniques.</p>
    <p num="p-0178">The chronically-implanted device is capable of providing sensing functions and therapy functions. According to one embodiment, the intravascular device possesses only sensing capabilities. According to this embodiment, there may be either one-way communication or two-way communication between the intravascular device and a central unit, such as between satellites and the control unit. In various sensing-only with one-way communication embodiments, the period is based on battery life and/or a measured parameter such as the average time to restenosis. In various sensing-only with two-way communication embodiments, the periodic sensing is triggered by the planet to sense and/or sense data and/or status.</p>
    <p num="p-0179">According to one embodiment, the chronically-implanted device possesses stimulating capabilities without sensing capabilities. According to this embodiment, there may be either one-way communication or two-way communication between the chronically-implanted device and a central unit, such as between satellites and the control unit. In various stimulating-only with one-way communication embodiments, the period is based on battery life and/or a measured parameter such as the average time to restenosis. In various stimulating-only with two-way communication embodiments, the periodic stimulation is triggered by the planet.</p>
    <p num="p-0180">According to one embodiment, the chronically-implanted device possesses both sensing and stimulating capabilities as described above. According to one embodiment, multiple, stent-like intravascular devices serve as satellite devices to a planet device.</p>
    <p num="p-0181">According to one embodiment, the chronically-implanted device is used as a remote sensing mode. In one embodiment, a pacemaker or implantable defibrillator with increased sense amplifier bandwidth detects the higher frequency electric fields generated by a stent based system and separates them by frequency filtering from other physiologic signals. One embodiment of the stent system includes a radially split stent acting as a dipole electric field antenna, and a pressure sensor integrated into a communication microsystem that is placed in a vein or artery. The microsystem power source provides energy for the sensor, communication and computation circuits. For example, the sensor measures peak pressure upon each cardiac cycle, and is capable of electively transmitting the latest measurement as a small packet of data that contains variation data from the last transmitted value. The data packet is able to be transmitted using various schemes. A self-clocking scheme for data encoding is particularly simple and reliable to decode.</p>
    <p num="p-0182">According to one embodiment, the chronically-implanted device functions as a repeater for remote sensors that provides two-way linking of distributed system nodes. The repeater listens for transmissions of data and data acknowledgments. The repeater matches traffic packets and, if an acknowledgment did not occur within a predefined time period, the repeater echoes the received data packet. The repeater function need not be a stand-alone function, as it can be combined with other functions on the chronically-implanted device. In one embodiment, intermediate computation is added to reduce, combine or evaluate data streams.</p>
    <p num="p-0183">According to one embodiment, the chronically-implanted device provides a therapy based on local and/or remote data. According to various embodiments, the therapy includes drug-eluting therapy and electrical therapy.</p>
    <p num="p-0184">According to one embodiment, the intravascular device provides stroke/heart attack first aid by infusion of aspirin or other drug. It is recognized that an increasing number of drugs are able to treat the debilitating affects of a stroke or a heart attack if a victim can receive a dose shortly after the event. An electrically controlled drug-eluting stent, when combined with suitable stroke or heart attack sensing technology, provides one or more controlled releases of a first-aid drug. One example of a first aid drug includes a blood-thinning agent such as aspirin and the like. In various embodiments, the amount of drug dispensed is controlled by clinician presets and automatic presets, if adequate sensing is available, to compensate for factors such as body weight or proximity of the stent to the traumatized area.</p>
    <p num="p-0185">The figures presented and described in detail above are similarly useful in describing the method aspects of the present subject matter. The methods described below are nonexclusive as other methods may be understood from the specification and the figures described above.</p>
    <p num="p-0186">One aspect provides a method in which a device is inserted intravascularly into a biosystem. The device is used to sense a mechanical parameter and to provide therapy. In one embodiment, a stent is inserted intravascularly into the biosystem. In one embodiment, the device is arterially inserted. In one method embodiment, a plurality of devices are inserted intravascularly into a biosystem to function together as a system.</p>
    <p num="p-0187">According to various embodiments of the method, the mechanical parameters sensed using the device include blood pressure, blood flow, and/or vessel size. According to various methods, the method further includes sensing oxygen, ions, coagulation, fibrosis, catecholamines, and/or intrinsic electrical signals generated by excitable tissue.</p>
    <p num="p-0188">According to various embodiments of the method, the therapy provided by the device includes stimulating electrically excitable tissue such as providing cardiac stimulus signals, eluting drugs to improve biocompatibility, eluting drugs in response to a detected stroke condition, eluting drugs in response to a detected heart attack condition and/or eluting an active substance in response to a sensed blood sugar level.</p>
    <p num="p-0189">Although specific embodiments have been illustrated and described herein, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that any arrangement which is calculated to achieve the same purpose may be substituted for the specific embodiment shown. This application is intended to cover any adaptations or variations of the present invention. It is to be understood that the above description is intended to be illustrative, and not restrictive.
