<heading>PRIORITY CLAIM</heading> <p num="p-0002">This application claims benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/605,205 titled “Measurement Device that Appears to a Computer System as a USB Mass Storage Device”, filed Aug. 27, 2004, whose inventors were Timothy H. Ousley, Mike Muecke, and Robert Watzlavick.</p>
<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">The present invention relates to the field of computer-based test and measurement systems, and more particularly relates to a measurement device operable to provide measurement data to a computer system via a measurement data file. In one embodiment the measurement device may appear to the computer system as a USB Mass Storage device, or other file storage device, on which the measurement data file is stored.</p>
  <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading> <p num="p-0004">Scientists and engineers often use test, measurement, or automation systems to perform a variety of functions, including measurement of a physical phenomenon or unit under test (UUT), test and analysis of physical phenomena, simulation, hardware-in-the-loop testing, process monitoring and control, control of mechanical or electrical machinery, data logging, and laboratory research, to name a few examples. The devices that interact with the physical systems under analysis may be collectively referred to as “measurement devices”.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">Measurement devices are often used in conjunction with computer systems. The computer system receives measurement data from the measurement device and performs much of the processing, analysis, or control for the application. Some configuration is usually necessary to make the measurement device work together correctly with the computer system. For example, many measurement devices require specific drivers to be installed on the computer system to enable communication with the measurement device.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">However, scientists and engineers are often not highly trained in the art of computer system configuration. Installing the measurement device and associated drivers on the computer system can be a difficult and time-consuming task. Also, the necessary drivers for the measurement device are sometimes not readily available (e.g., when the measurement device is moved to a location in the field and the driver installation CD becomes lost or damaged), which can result in downtime of the measurement system.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">Another disadvantage associated with the traditional approach of requiring specific drivers for measurement devices is the cost of developing the drivers. Measurement device vendors may have to develop and test drivers for multiple operating systems and may also have to maintain the drivers or develop new ones as the operating systems evolve. Therefore it would be desirable to enable a computer system to communicate with a measurement device without requiring the use of specialized drivers.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">The Universal Serial Bus (USB) technology that has become widespread in recent years simplifies the task of installing some devices on computer systems. When a device is connected to a host computer's USB bus, the device is immediately recognized by the host computer, dynamically enumerated, and assigned an address. The host computer and the device then perform a query/response protocol to enable the host computer to obtain information about the device, such as the class of device and various other details that the host computer needs to know for its operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">The USB standards define various broad device classes for certain well-known kinds of devices, such as “Printer”, “Human Interface Device”, “Audio”, “Video”, “Mass Storage”, etc. Operating systems that support USB technology typically include pre-loaded drivers for these USB device classes. If a new USB device connected to the host computer belongs to one of these USB device classes then the host computer can often simply configure communication with the new device to occur using the driver for the appropriate USB device class. Thus, the user is not required to install a driver specifically for the device, and a vendor is not required to develop a driver specifically for the device.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">As mentioned above, one standard USB device class is “Mass Storage”. A USB Mass Storage device can typically store files received from the host computer and/or store files for receipt by the host computer. Operation of USB Mass Storage devices is defined by various documents, such as the “Universal Serial Bus Mass Storage Class Control/Bulk/Interrupt (CBI) Transport” specification and the “Universal Serial Bus Mass Storage Class Bulk-Only Transport” specification.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0011">According to one embodiment of the invention, a computer system may receive measurement data from a measurement device via one or more files generated by the measurement device. The measurement device may be coupled to the computer system and may receive a signal from a physical system or unit under test and generate measurement data based on the signal. The measurement device may be operable to create one or more files based on the measurement data it generates.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">The files may comprise files of any kind and may be structured in any desired way. In one embodiment the files may be simple files that simply represent the measurement data itself, e.g., as binary files comprising binary values representing the measurement data values or human-readable text files indicating the measurement data values. In another embodiment the files may be more structurally complex or may include elements other than the measurement data. For example, the measurement device may be operable to generate: spreadsheet files for particular spreadsheet programs, where the spreadsheet files include the measurement data; HTML, XML, or other markup language files that include the measurement data; a file representing a graph, where the graph visually indicates the measurement data; an executable program file that utilizes the measurement data; etc. These files may also include elements other than the measurement data. For example, an HTML file generated by the measurement device may not only include the measurement data but may also include text or graphic elements, e.g., as in a report file.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">Thus, in one embodiment the measurement device may differ from traditional measurement devices in that it not only acquires/generates the raw measurement data but also applies a higher-level structuring to the measurement data and/or generates one or more files based on the measurement data.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">A measurement application program executing on the computer system may receive the one or more files generated by the measurement device and may read or analyze the files to perform the desired measurement function. In one embodiment the measurement application program may possess knowledge of what kind of files are generated by the measurement device and may be operable to utilize these files accordingly, e.g., to obtain, process, display and/or store the included measurement data. In the prior art, measurement application programs typically do not receive measurement data in the form of files, but rather communicate with measurement devices to receive raw measurement data.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">The file(s) generated by the measurement device may be stored in memory on the measurement device or may be dynamically generated as they are read by the computer system.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">In one embodiment the measurement device may also be operable to receive files from the computer system. In one embodiment the measurement device may be configured via a configuration file received from the computer system. For example, a user or application on the computer system may create a configuration file that includes various commands, settings, or attributes related to the configuration or operation of the measurement device. In response to the configuration file being sent from the computer system to the measurement device, the measurement device may be operable to analyze the configuration file and configure or control itself according to the commands, settings, or attributes therein.</p>
  <p num="p-0017">In various embodiments, the measurement device may be coupled to the computer system in any of various ways, and the computer system may communicate with the measurement device using any technique to receive files generated by the measurement device or send files to the measurement device. According to one embodiment, the measurement device may comprise a USB device coupled to a USB bus of the computer system. In particular, in one embodiment the measurement device may appear to the computer system as a USB Mass Storage device, and the files generated by the measurement device may appear as files stored on a USB Mass Storage device. Thus, the computer system may communicate with the measurement device to obtain the generated files in the same standard manner in which it would obtain files stored on any other USB Mass Storage device.</p>
  <p num="p-0018">The computer system may execute an operating system that provides support for detecting and communicating with USB devices. In particular, the operating system may include software, e.g., a driver, for communicating with USB Mass Storage devices. In response to the measurement device being connected to the computer system, the computer system may initiate a query/response protocol with the measurement device to obtain information about the measurement device. The measurement device may inform the computer system that it belongs to the USB “Mass Storage” device class, as well as provide other details that the computer system needs to know to communicate with the measurement device. The computer system may then configure itself to communicate with the measurement device as a USB Mass Storage device. For example, in one embodiment the computer system may be operable to read measurement data files from a memory of the measurement device using standard communication techniques for reading files from USB Mass Storage devices. Similarly, in one embodiment the computer system may write a configuration file or other file to a memory of the measurement device using standard communication techniques for writing files to USB Mass Storage devices.</p>
  <p num="p-0019">Thus, in an embodiment in which the measurement device conforms to USB Mass Storage specifications, the measurement device may advantageously be installed on the computer system without requiring a special driver for the measurement device to be installed. This may be advantageous to the user in that he can easily and quickly set up the measurement device on any computer system with an operating system that supports USB devices, without needing to possess or install specialized drivers for the measurement device.</p>

Examples of a measurement device include an instrument, such as a traditional stand-alone “box” instrument, a computer-based instrument (instrument on a card) or external instrument, a data acquisition card, a datalogger, a device external to a computer that operates similarly to a data acquisition card, a smart sensor, one or more DAQ or measurement cards or modules in a chassis, an image acquisition device, such as an image acquisition (or machine vision) card (also called a video capture board) or smart camera, a motion control device, a robot having machine vision, and other similar types of devices. Exemplary “stand-alone” instruments include oscilloscopes, multimeters, signal analyzers, arbitrary waveform generators, spectroscopes, and similar measurement, test, or automation instruments.</p>
  <p num="p-0042">A measurement device may connect to a host computer or computers during, before, and/or after acquiring data, or may never connect to a host computer.</p>
  <p num="p-0043">A measurement device may be further operable to perform control functions, e.g., in response to analysis of the acquired or stored data. For example, the measurement device may send a control signal to an external system, such as a motion control system or to a sensor, in response to particular data. A measurement device may also be operable to perform automation functions, i.e., may receive and analyze data, and issue automation control signals in response.</p>
  <p num="p-0044">Measurement Data—data generated by a measurement device. For example, the measurement device may receive a signal from a unit under test or a physical system and may generate measurement data based on the signal. The measurement device may be coupled to another device, e.g., a computer system, that receives the measurement data generated by the measurement device.</p>
  <p num="p-0045">Live measurement data—measurement data that is generated continuously or quasi-continuously by a measurement device. For example, live measurement data may comprise a stream of data elements (e.g., floating point numbers or other elements) generated in rapid succession by the measurement device. Examples of live measurement data include data that is generated in real time based on a physical signal, e.g., where data values are generated in a live or streaming manner. One specific example of live measurement data is data that represents a continuous waveform.</p>
  <p num="h-0008">FIG. <b>1</b>—Computer System</p>
  <p num="p-0046"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a computer system <b>82</b> operable to execute a program that performs a measurement function. This program is also referred to herein as a “measurement application program”. As shown, a measurement device <b>80</b> may be coupled to the computer system <b>82</b>. The measurement device <b>80</b> may receive a signal from a physical system or unit under test <b>150</b> and may generate measurement data based on the signal. In various embodiments, the measurement device <b>80</b> may generate measurement data based on any of various kinds of signals received from any of various kinds of physical systems or units under test <b>150</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0047">The measurement application program executing on the computer system <b>82</b> may receive the measurement data generated by the measurement device <b>80</b> and may utilize the measurement data to perform the measurement function. The measurement data may be utilized to perform any of various kinds of measurement functions, such as test and/or analysis of the physical system or unit under test <b>150</b>, simulation, hardware-in-the-loop testing, process monitoring and control, control of mechanical or electrical machinery, data logging, laboratory research, etc.</p>
  <p num="p-0048">According to one embodiment, the measurement device <b>80</b> may be operable to generate one or more files based on the measurement data it generates. The files may comprise files of any kind and may be structured in any desired way. In one embodiment the files may be simple files that simply represent the measurement data itself, e.g., as binary files comprising binary values representing the measurement data values or human-readable text files indicating the measurement data values.</p>
  <p num="p-0049">In another embodiment the files may be more structurally complex or may include elements other than the measurement data. For example, the measurement device <b>80</b> may be operable to generate: spreadsheet files for particular spreadsheet applications, where the spreadsheet files include the measurement data; HTML, XML, or other markup language files that include the measurement data; a file representing a graph, where the graph visually indicates the measurement data; an executable program file that utilizes the measurement data; etc. These files may also include elements other than the measurement data. For example, an HTML file generated by the measurement device <b>80</b> may not only include the measurement data but may also include text or graphic elements, e.g., as in a report file. Thus, in one embodiment the measurement device <b>80</b> may differ from traditional measurement devices in that it not only generates the raw measurement data but also applies a higher-level structuring and/or interpretation to the measurement data and generates a file based on the measurement data.</p>
  <p num="p-0050">The measurement application program executing on the computer system <b>82</b> may receive the one or more files generated by the measurement device <b>80</b> and may read or analyze the files to perform the desired measurement function. The measurement application program may possess knowledge of what kind of files are generated by the measurement device <b>80</b> and may be operable to utilize these files accordingly, e.g., to obtain, process, display and/or store the included measurement data. In the prior art, measurement application programs typically do not receive measurement data in the form of files, but rather communicate with measurement devices to receive raw measurement data.</p>
  <p num="p-0051">In various embodiments, the measurement device <b>80</b> may be coupled to the computer system <b>82</b> in any of various ways, and the computer system <b>82</b> may communicate with the measurement device <b>80</b> using any technique to receive the files generated by the measurement device <b>80</b>. According to one embodiment, the measurement device <b>80</b> may comprise a USB device coupled to a USB bus of the computer system <b>82</b>. In particular, in one embodiment the measurement device <b>80</b> may appear to the computer system <b>82</b> as a USB device of a first type, e.g., as a USB Mass Storage device, and the files generated by the measurement device <b>80</b> may appear as files stored on a USB Mass Storage device. Thus, the computer system <b>82</b> may communicate with the measurement device <b>80</b> to obtain the generated files in the same standard manner in which it would obtain files stored on any other USB Mass Storage device. Embodiments in which the measurement device <b>80</b> appears as a USB Mass Storage device are described in further detail below.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">As used herein, the term USB is intended to include prior, current, and future versions of the Universal Serial Bus (USB) standard and similar standards.</p>
  <p num="p-0053">In another embodiment the measurement device <b>80</b> may not appear to the computer system <b>82</b> as a USB Mass Storage device but may appear as another type of file storage device, e.g., a file storage device that uses communication standards other than USB. As used herein, a file storage device may comprise a device that appears to a computer system as a device on which files can be stored and/or from which files can be received. For some types of file storage devices, the computer system may be able to automatically detect connection of the file storage device to the computer system and may be operable to automatically configure itself to communicate with the file storage device, e.g., by using a standard file storage device driver provided by or built in to the operating system of the computer system.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the computer system <b>82</b> may include a display device. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a GUI of the measurement application program displayed on the display device of the computer system <b>82</b>. The computer system <b>82</b> may also include a memory medium(s) on which programs or software components may be stored. For example, the memory medium may store the measurement application program executed by the computer system <b>82</b>. The memory medium may also store operating system software. For example, the operating system may provide support for automatically detecting and communicating with USB devices or other kinds of devices. In particular, the operating system may include software, e.g., a driver, for communicating with USB Mass Storage devices or other file storage devices. Thus, in an embodiment in which the measurement device <b>80</b> conforms to USB Mass Storage specifications or other standard file storage device specifications, the measurement device <b>80</b> may advantageously be installed on the computer system <b>82</b> without requiring a special driver for the measurement device <b>80</b> to be installed, as described below.</p>

  <p num="p-0056">The computer may include at least one central processing unit or CPU (processor) <b>160</b> which is coupled to a processor or host bus <b>162</b>. The CPU <b>160</b> may be any of various types, including an x86 processor, e.g., a Pentium class, a PowerPC processor, a CPU from the SPARC family of RISC processors, as well as others. A memory medium, typically comprising RAM and referred to as main memory, <b>166</b> is coupled to the host bus <b>162</b> by means of memory controller <b>164</b>.

  <p num="p-0057">In one embodiment, a Universal Serial Bus (USB) <b>191</b> may also be coupled to the computer system, e.g., through a bus controller <b>168</b> or bus bridge logic. Various kinds of USB devices may be coupled to the computer system <b>82</b> via the USB bus <b>191</b>. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates USB Device <b>192</b> coupled to the USB bus <b>191</b>, which may be a USB device of any kind.

In various embodiments the measurement device <b>80</b> may be coupled to the USB bus <b>191</b> in various ways, e.g., via a USB cable or other connection mechanism.</p>
  <p num="p-0058">An expansion or input/output bus <b>170</b> may also be coupled to the host bus <b>162</b> by means of a bus controller <b>168</b> or bus bridge logic. The expansion bus <b>170</b> may be the PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) expansion bus, although other bus types can also be used. The expansion bus <b>170</b> may include slots for various devices. The computer <b>82</b> further comprises a video display subsystem <b>180</b> and hard drive <b>182</b> coupled to the expansion bus <b>170</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the computer system <b>82</b> also couples to measurement devices other than the measurement device <b>80</b>. A data acquisition card <b>114</b> is shown coupled to the expansion bus <b>170</b>, as well as a GPIB card <b>122</b> which couples to a GPIB bus.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">Although not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a network interface card or other network device may also be coupled to the computer <b>82</b>, which may enable the computer <b>82</b> to communicate with other devices via a network such as the Internet, or an Intranet or LAN.

  <p num="h-0010">FIG. <b>3</b>—Measurement Device Block Diagram</p>
  <p num="p-0060"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram representing one embodiment of the measurement device <b>80</b>. It is noted that <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> represents an exemplary embodiment, and alternative architectures are contemplated. As shown, the measurement device <b>80</b> may include a measurement acquisition unit <b>81</b>. The measurement acquisition unit <b>81</b> may couple to a physical system or unit under test <b>150</b> to receive signals (typically generated by transducers) and may generate measurement data based on the signals, as described above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">In various embodiments, the measurement acquisition unit <b>81</b> may comprise hardware of any kind, depending on the kind of measurement device <b>80</b>, i.e., depending on the type of signal acquired and type of measurement data generated. The measurement acquisition unit <b>81</b> may comprise a device of any kind or may conform to any of various instrumentation standards, such as a data acquisition device with associated signal conditioning circuitry, a GPIB instrument, a VXI instrument, a PXI instrument, a video device or camera with associated image acquisition (or machine vision) hardware, or a motion control device, to name a few examples.</p>
  <p num="p-0062">The measurement acquisition unit <b>81</b> may also be configured to generate files based on the generated measurement data, as described above. In one embodiment the measurement device <b>80</b> may include a memory <b>86</b>, and the generated files may be stored in the memory <b>86</b>. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an embodiment in which various measurement data files <b>84</b> are stored in the memory <b>86</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0063">In one embodiment the measurement device <b>80</b> may also be operable to receive files from an external source, e.g., from the computer system <b>82</b> described above. The files may be stored in the memory <b>86</b>. In one embodiment the measurement device <b>80</b> may be configured via a configuration file <b>85</b> stored in the memory <b>86</b>. For example, a user or application on the computer system <b>82</b> may create a configuration file <b>85</b> that includes various commands, settings, or attributes related to the configuration of the measurement device <b>80</b>. In response to the configuration file <b>85</b> being sent from the computer <b>82</b> to the measurement device <b>80</b>, the measurement device <b>80</b> (e.g., the measurement acquisition unit <b>81</b>) may be operable to analyze the configuration file <b>85</b> and configure or control itself according to the commands, settings, or attributes therein.</p>
  <p num="p-0064">In various embodiments the memory <b>86</b> may comprise a memory medium of any kind. In one embodiment the memory <b>86</b> may comprise flash memory. In other embodiments the memory <b>86</b> may comprise any other type of memory suitable for storing files, such as RAM, magnetic media, etc.</p>
  <p num="p-0065">In one embodiment the measurement device <b>80</b> may be engineered so that the memory <b>86</b> is detachable from the measurement device <b>80</b>. Detaching the memory <b>86</b> may enable users to replace the memory <b>86</b> with another memory <b>86</b>. This may provide various advantages to users. For example, in one embodiment the memory <b>86</b> may comprise a standard and commonly available memory component, such as a Compact Flash™ component, a Memory Stick® component, a Smart Media™ component, an SDCard, a microdrive, a USB memory key, etc. The measurement device <b>80</b> may include a slot or compartment for inserting the standard memory component. Such standard memory components are available in different sizes, e.g., 128 MB, 256 MB, 512 MB, 1 GB, etc. Different measurement applications may require different amounts of memory, e.g., depending on factors such as the amount of measurement data generated, the rate at which the measurement application program consumes the measurement data, etc. Thus, if the memory <b>86</b> is a detachable and commonly available memory component then the user can purchase and attach a memory component of any appropriate size to the measurement device <b>80</b>. This may also lower the device vendor's cost to produce the measurement device <b>80</b> and lower the user's cost to purchase the measurement device <b>80</b> since the user may be able to purchase the measurement device <b>80</b> without memory and re-use a standard memory component already in his possession as the memory <b>86</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0066">In an alternative embodiment the measurement device <b>80</b> may not have a memory <b>86</b> for storing files. For example, instead of generating files based on the measurement data and storing them in a memory, the measurement device <b>80</b> may be operable to dynamically construct files in response to requests from the computer system <b>82</b>, e.g., where a dynamically constructed file is based on recently generated measurement data. Thus, the measurement device <b>80</b> may not have a file system or memory <b>86</b> on which files are stored per se, but instead may dynamically generate files as they are requested and stream them to the computer system <b>82</b>. Similarly as described above, files that are dynamically generated in this manner may comprise files of any kind, may be structured in any desired way, and may possibly include elements other than measurement data.</p>
  <p num="p-0067">As described above, in one embodiment the measurement device <b>80</b> may couple to the computer system <b>82</b> as a USB Mass Storage device or other standard type of file storage device. Thus, the computer system <b>82</b> may read files from the memory <b>86</b> and possibly write files to the memory <b>86</b> using standard communication techniques for communicating with USB Mass Storage devices or other file storage devices. As shown in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the measurement device <b>80</b> may include a USB connector <b>83</b> by which the measurement device <b>80</b> can connect to the computer system <b>82</b>, e.g., via a cable connecting the USB connector <b>83</b> to a USB port or hub of the computer system <b>82</b>.

  <p num="h-0011">FIG. <b>4</b>—Flowchart</p>
  <p num="p-0068"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart diagram illustrating one embodiment of a method for utilizing the measurement device <b>80</b> in a measurement application. It is noted that <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a representative embodiment in which the measurement device <b>80</b> appears to the computer system <b>82</b> as a USB Mass Storage device, and alternative embodiments are contemplated. Also, various elements may be combined, omitted, or performed in different orders.</p>
  <p num="p-0069">In <b>301</b>, the measurement device <b>80</b> may be connected to a USB port or hub of the computer system <b>82</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0070">In <b>303</b>, in response to the measurement device <b>80</b> being connected, the computer system <b>82</b> may initiate a query/response protocol with the measurement device <b>80</b> to obtain information about the measurement device <b>80</b>. The measurement device <b>80</b> may inform the computer system <b>82</b> that it belongs to the USB “Mass Storage” device class, as well as providing other details that the computer system <b>82</b> needs to know to communicate with the measurement device <b>80</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0071">In <b>305</b>, the computer system <b>82</b> may configure itself to communicate with the measurement device <b>80</b> as a USB Mass Storage device. As described above, the computer system <b>82</b> may execute an operating system that provides built-in support for USB devices, including USB Mass Storage devices. Thus, <b>305</b> may involve the computer system <b>82</b> configuring itself to communicate with the measurement device <b>80</b> using its standard driver for USB Mass Storage devices. This may be advantageous to the user in that he can easily and quickly set up the measurement device <b>80</b> on any computer system with an operating system that supports USB devices, without needing to possess or install specialized drivers for the measurement device <b>80</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0072">As shown in <b>307</b>, in one embodiment the user or a measurement application program executing on the computer system <b>82</b> may store a configuration file on the measurement device <b>80</b>, e.g., in the memory <b>86</b>, to configure the measurement device <b>80</b>. For example, as described above, in one embodiment the computer system <b>82</b> may write the configuration file to the memory <b>86</b> of the measurement device <b>80</b> using standard communication techniques for writing files to USB Mass Storage devices.</p>
  <p num="p-0073">The configuration file may include various commands, settings, or attributes related to the configuration of the measurement device <b>80</b>. In response to the configuration file being stored on the measurement device <b>80</b>, the measurement device <b>80</b> may be operable to analyze the configuration file and configure itself according to the commands, settings, or attributes therein. For example, depending on the type of measurement device <b>80</b>, the configuration file may specify properties such as acquisition rate, coupling, gain, scaling, channels, or trigger conditions.</p>
  <p num="p-0074">In <b>309</b>, the measurement device <b>80</b> may generate measurement data, e.g., based on one or more signals received from a physical system or unit under test <b>150</b>, and in one embodiment may store the measurement data in a measurement data file on the measurement device, e.g., in the memory <b>86</b>. As described above, the measurement data file may comprise a file of any kind, such as: a binary file comprising binary values representing the measurement data; a human-readable text file indicating the measurement data; a spreadsheet file for a particular spreadsheet application, where the spreadsheet file includes the measurement data; an HTML, XML, or other markup language file that includes the measurement data; a file including a graph or image, where the graph or image visually indicates the measurement data; an executable program file that utilizes the measurement data; etc.</p>
  <p num="p-0075">In <b>311</b>, a measurement application program executing on the computer system <b>82</b> may read the measurement data file from the measurement device <b>80</b>. For example, as described above, in one embodiment the computer system <b>82</b> may read the measurement data file from the memory <b>86</b> of the measurement device <b>80</b> using standard communication techniques for reading files from USB Mass Storage devices, e.g., using a standard driver for USB Mass Storage devices and without requiring a device driver specific to the measurement device <b>80</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0076">The measurement application program may be operable to process or access the measurement data file in any way, depending on the particular measurement application and the type of measurement data file. For example, in one embodiment the measurement application program may analyze the measurement data file to obtain the measurement data, may display the measurement data in a GUI on a display device of the computer system <b>82</b>, may utilize the measurement data to perform tests of the physical system or unit under test <b>150</b>, and/or may store the measurement data in persistent storage, to name a few examples. The measurement application program may comprise any program which accesses the measurement data file, possibly including a spreadsheet, an HTML browser, a text file editor/viewer, or any other program which accesses the measurement data file. In one embodiment a standard program provided by the operating system of the computer system <b>82</b> may be used as the measurement application program to access or view the measurement data file.</p>
  <p num="p-0077">As indicated by the arrow returning to <b>309</b>, <b>309</b> and <b>311</b> may be performed in a repetitive manner. For example, the measurement device <b>80</b> may periodically or repetitively generate measurement data and store or update a measurement data file based on the measurement data. The measurement application program may periodically or repetitively obtain the measurement data file(s) from the measurement device <b>80</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0078">In one embodiment the measurement device <b>80</b> may be operable to generate live measurement data, and <b>309</b> and <b>311</b> may be repetitively performed in such a way that the measurement application program is able to receive the live measurement data in a continuous or quasi-continuous manner. As described above, live measurement data may comprise a stream of data elements (e.g., floating point numbers or other elements) generated in rapid succession by the measurement device <b>80</b>, such as data that represents a continuous waveform. The measurement application program may process or utilize the live measurement data in various ways. As one simple example, the live measurement data may be graphed in a GUI element displayed on a GUI of the measurement application program. The graph may scroll over time or may refresh as new live measurement data is received. In one embodiment the graph may appear to the user as a continuously scrolling graph, e.g., similar to the manner in which live measurement data is displayed on a traditional oscilloscope.</p>
  <p num="p-0079">In various embodiments, the functionality of <b>309</b> and <b>311</b> being performed in a repetitive or periodic manner may be implemented in any desired way. Any desired methodology may be utilized to coordinate the activities of the measurement device <b>80</b> writing measurement data files and the measurement application program on the computer system <b>82</b> reading the measurement data files. In various embodiments, each measurement data file may include any amount of measurement data, and the measurement application program may obtain measurement data files from the measurement device <b>80</b> at any rate.</p>
  <p num="p-0080">For example, in one embodiment the measurement device <b>80</b> may write continuously or write at a rapid rate to update a single measurement data file with newly generated measurement data. Thus, the measurement application program may repetitively read from the measurement data file to obtain recent measurement data. The measurement application program may read from the measurement data file at any rate and may read any amount of data at a time, as appropriate for a particular application.</p>
  <p num="p-0081">In another embodiment the measurement device <b>80</b> may create multiple measurement data files. For example, the measurement device <b>80</b> may be operable to periodically acquire signals from the physical system or unit under test <b>150</b>, generate measurement data based on the signals, and create a new measurement data file based on the measurement data for each acquisition. Thus, each time the measurement application program on the computer system <b>82</b> obtains measurement data from the measurement device <b>80</b>, it may do so by obtaining a different measurement data file. For example, there may be a file naming convention to enable the measurement application program to know the order in which the measurement data files were generated so that the measurement data files are obtained in the correct order, or other ordering techniques, such as file timestamps, may be utilized for this purpose.</p>
  <p num="p-0082">In one embodiment the measurement device <b>80</b> may be operable to periodically remove itself from the operating system of the computer system <b>82</b> and then re-attach itself. For example, each time the measurement device <b>80</b> creates a new measurement data file, it may remove and re-attach itself in this manner. This may have the effect of notifying the computer system <b>82</b> that a new measurement data file has been generated. For example, the computer system <b>82</b> may be operable to re-discover the measurement device <b>80</b> each time it reattaches itself to the operating system, and the new measurement data file may be opened in response.</p>
  <p num="p-0083">In an alternative embodiment the measurement device <b>80</b> may be operable to provide measurement data files to the measurement application program without actually storing any files on the measurement device <b>80</b>. For example, as described above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in one embodiment the measurement device <b>80</b> may be operable to dynamically generate measurement data files based on recently generated measurement data in response to requests from the measurement application program and may stream the dynamically generated files to the computer system <b>82</b> without the files ever being stored on the measurement device <b>80</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0084">It is noted that <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> represents an exemplary embodiment of a method for utilizing the measurement device <b>80</b> in a measurement application, and numerous alternative embodiments are contemplated. For example, in one embodiment the measurement application program may be operable to periodically or repetitively send a configuration file or other file to the measurement device <b>80</b>. For example, the measurement application program may operate in conjunction with the measurement device <b>80</b> to perform a process control function. The measurement application program may obtain measurement data files from the measurement device <b>80</b>, analyze the measurement data in the files, and issue commands to control or provide feedback to the measurement device <b>80</b> based on the analysis, where the commands are included in a file sent to the measurement device <b>80</b>. The measurement device <b>80</b> may be operable to read the commands from the file and respond accordingly.</p>
  <p num="p-0085">As noted above, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a representative embodiment in which the measurement device <b>80</b> appears to the computer system <b>82</b> as a USB Mass Storage device, and alternative embodiments are contemplated. For example, in other embodiments the measurement device <b>80</b> may appear to the computer system <b>82</b> as another type of file storage device other than a USB Mass Storage Device. In one embodiment the computer system <b>82</b> may still be able to receive measurement data files from the measurement device <b>80</b> without using a device driver specific to the measurement device <b>80</b> or without requiring a device driver specific to the measurement device <b>80</b> to be installed. For example, the measurement device <b>80</b> may conform to file storage specifications other than USB Mass Storage specifications such that the computer system <b>82</b> is able to automatically detect connection of the measurement device <b>80</b> to the computer system <b>82</b> and configure itself to communicate with the measurement device <b>80</b>, e.g., by using a standard file storage device driver provided by the operating system, similarly as described above.</p>
  <p num="p-0086">It is noted that various embodiments may further include receiving, sending or storing instructions and/or data implemented in accordance with the foregoing description upon a carrier medium.</p>
  <p num="p-0087">Although the embodiments above have been described in considerable detail, numerous variations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art once the above disclosure is fully appreciated. It is intended that the following claims be interpreted to embrace all such variations and modifications.</p>
