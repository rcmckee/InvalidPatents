The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records, but otherwise reserves all copyrights whatsoever.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0004">The present invention relates to systems and methods for creating, monitoring, updating, negotiating and completing syndicated loans, and in particular to systems and methods relating to syndicated loans having multiple bookrunners.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0005">In various aspects the invention provides systems, methods, and computer programming for improved secure communications and data management and control. The invention has particular applicability to the arrangement and administration of business transactions, such as new syndicated loans offered by banks and other parties, and in particular loans administered by multiple bookrunners. In particular, in various aspects the invention provides improvements in secure and effective management and protection of communications and documents. The secure communications thus provided are particularly useful in, for example, financial transactions which require the sharing of data and other information among multiple arrangers, investors or other lenders, and between lawyers, borrowers, advisors, auditors, and other members of loan syndication/distribution teams.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">In various embodiments the invention enables the creation, review, and management of data relating to loans and other transactions coordinated by multiple arrangers or bookrunners, who may be jointly and severally designated as authorized keepers of various documents used in processing, executing, and otherwise documenting single syndicated loans. For example, the invention provides methods, systems, and programming for improved arrangement and administration of syndicated debts using computer networks. Each of a plurality of bookrunners is authorized to invite any number of other bookrunners, as well as any number of loan or debt participants, or underwriters (i.e. investors or lenders), to participate in offering and administering a debt such as a new loan, typically by providing various forms of information describing the borrower, its industry sector, credit analyses and prospects, the proposed terms for the syndicated loan facility, and possibly any potential participants in making the loan. Invitees who accept such invitations may be associated with the inviting bookrunner, and upon being accepted as participants may be granted by the bookrunner access to various sets of communications, documents, and other information concerning the proposed loan, including documents which are (a) maintained in confidence between the bookrunner and one or more of such accepting participant(s)—such as legal documents (draft facility agreement); and (b) which are shared between all or sets of bookrunners and other participants.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">Among the advantages offered by syndicated debt bookrunning in accordance with invention are the display of investor and syndication-contact information in a systematic way, so as to improve possibilities for the identification and selection of prospective investors and contacts; recording and tracking of investor feedback; and reporting on syndication status. For example, one of the features offered by the invention which enables such functionality, and other advantages, is the provision of centralized, common databases (i.e., data sets) of data related to institutions, individuals, and other parties who may be helpful in setting up, processing, or otherwise assisting in the syndicated deal process. For example, the invention provides one or more centralized databases comprising relevant information pertaining to banks, lenders, investors, arrangers, bookrunners, and others who might be desirable participants in the loan syndication process. Such databases, and various reports based on data stored in such databases, can be made available to all authorized users of a syndication system, or to selected subsets of such users. For example, all potential bookrunners and arrangers can be provided access to such information, which they may use in identifying and reaching out to likely participants.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">In preferred embodiments, such information is searchable and cross-indexed, so that individuals seeking to contact, review, or identify prospective participants can locate correct, standardized information identifying and otherwise describing such participants, and that the common or shared use of correct information can be assured.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">In further embodiments, redundantly-stored information can be synchronized automatically, or upon user confirmation, following user modification, and/or notice of modifications to data may be automatically provided for users who might be affected by or otherwise concerned about such changes.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">In one aspect the invention provides systems, methods, and computer programming for processing data pertaining to a syndicated loan offering to be administered by a plurality of bookrunners. For example, media according to this aspect of the invention can comprise computer-readable code for causing a computer to receive data (or signals representing such data) identifying a plurality of invitees, where at least one of the invitees is or has been invited by each of a plurality of bookrunners to participate in a syndicated loan offering to be administered by the plurality of bookrunners. Subject to receipt of data indicating acceptance of such invitations by the invitees, the computer can be caused to identify accepting invitees as participants in the syndicated loan offering and associate with data identifying each participant a data-access authorization, where the data-access authorization associated with each respective participant is adapted to permit access by the respective participant to at least a deal data set and a bookrunner data set. The bookrunner data set can be accessible by the bookrunner that invited the participant to participate in the loan, by the respective participant, and by at least one other participant invited by the bookrunner to participate in the loan. The deal data set can be accessible by, for example, all participants participating in the syndicated loan offering.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">In a related aspect, the invention provides systems, methods, and computer programming for processing data pertaining to a syndicated loan offering to be administered by a plurality of bookrunners. For example, media according to the invention can comprise computer-readable code for causing a computer to, in response to submission to a syndicated loan application server of a data-access authorization received in response to acceptance of an invitation from one of a plurality of bookrunners administering a syndicated loan offering to participate in the syndicated loan offering, either as a loan participant or as a loan arranger, enable access to data stored within at least one of a bookrunner data set and a deal data set, wherein the data-access authorization is adapted to permit access by the respective participant to at least a deal data set and a bookrunner data set, the bookrunner data set is accessible by the bookrunner that invited the participant to participate in the loan and by a plurality of loan participants invited by the bookrunner to participate in the loan, and the deal data is set accessible by all participants and all bookrunners participating in the syndicated loan offering.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">The invention further provides systems, methods, and computer programming for processing data pertaining to a syndicated loan offering to be administered by a plurality of bookrunners in which, for example, media according to the invention can comprise computer-readable code for causing a computer to associate with data received by the computer data identifying the received data as associated with a syndicated loan offering and as associated with one of a plurality of bookrunners administering the syndicated loan offering; store the received data in persistent computer-readable memory, and, subject to verification of authority, allow access to the stored data by at least one of (a) the bookrunner with whom the stored data has been associated, and (b) a participant authorized on behalf of the bookrunner to access the data. Such data can comprise, for example, data representing documents associated with syndicated loan offering, and/or contact or other information relating to confirmed or potential loan bookrunners, underwriters, participants or invitees.</p>
    <p num="p-0013">In further aspects, as described below, the invention provides systems, methods, and computer programming for processing data pertaining to a syndicated loan offering to be administered by a plurality of bookrunners in which, for example, media according to the invention can comprise computer-readable code for causing a computer to upon entry of an execution command from a borrower or other input system, access data corresponding to the status of a plurality of criteria relating to the offering of the syndicated loan, access to said data controlled by a plurality of bookrunners administering said syndicated loan offering; and display on an output device associated with the borrower input system, in human-readable form, information indicating said status. Such information can, in addition or instead, be output in spreadsheet or other format for permanent soft or hard storage.</p>
    <p num="p-0014">Further aspects of the invention are described below.</p>
    <p num="p-0015">As will be understood by those skilled in the relevant arts, a bookrunner is a syndicated loan arranger charged with responsibility for all or part of the bookbuilding process for a prospective loan. A joint bookrunner is a syndicated loan arranger charged with responsibility for part of the bookbuilding process for the prospective loan. Each joint bookrunner is typically responsible for underwriting a portion of the loan. For example, for a $500 million deal with two joint bookrunners, each bookrunner may undertake to underwrite $250 million each. The portion(s) of the loan associated with a single bookrunner may be spread across or divided among any one or more of any tranches the loan is to be divided into. An arranger is a bank or other financial institution responsible for underwriting a portion of a loan that may not necessarily be assigned responsibility for bookbuilding/distribution of the deal.</p>
    <p num="p-0016">For purposes of this disclosure, the term “joint bookrunner” is shortened to “bookrunner”; the two are used interchangeably, as the distinction, where applicable, is clear from the context.</p>
    <p num="p-0017">Administration of a loan or other transaction can involve any aspect of arranging, documenting, memorializing, or offering an existing, past, or prospective loan.</p>

Note that for purposes of this disclosure, facsimile numbers are telephone numbers.</p>
    <p num="p-0035">The term “user” as contemplated herein can include bookrunners, arrangers, invitees, participants, borrowers, lawyers, administrators, and/or others associated with the loan syndication (e.g., bookbuilding or bookrunning) and/or administration process, and non-participating observers.</p>
    <p num="p-0036">Many of the functions provided by the invention may be implemented using specially-designed dedicated electronic circuits, general purpose data processors executing specialized software programming, and/or combinations thereof. As will be understood by those skilled in the relevant arts, a wide number of suitable computer programs, programming languages, compilers, and general- and special purpose processors are now available commercially, and doubtless they will continue to be developed.</p>
    <p num="p-0037">Storage devices or facilities <b>14</b> may include any forms of storage media known for computers and suitable for the purposes described herein. These may include, for example, disk drives, CD Rom drives, other magnetic or optical drives, memory devices such as ROM or RAM, or USB devices that store data in volatile or persistent form. Preferred storage facilities <b>14</b> provide for multiple levels and divisions of secure or otherwise controlled access. For example, in the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, storage facility <b>14</b> comprises a global database or other “public” data set <b>92</b>, a plurality of first-level private data sets <b>92</b>, pluralities of second-level private data sets <b>96</b>, and pluralities of third-level private data sets <b>98</b>. Each of first-level private data sets <b>92</b> is associated with a plurality of second-level private data sets <b>96</b>, each of which is further associated with a plurality of third-level data sets <b>98</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0038">For example, in an embodiment of the invention shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and adapted for use in administering syndicated loan offerings, global data set <b>92</b> can comprise data intended to be shared among all authorized users of system <b>100</b> and/or data storage facility(ies) <b>14</b>, and/or other systems supported by data server <b>22</b>. This can include, for example, data representing contact information useful in establishing communications with bookrunners or other arrangers, borrowers, lenders (including for example both invitee and participant lenders), support service providers, and others, so that the proposal and administration of loan offerings can be made easier and more efficient.</p>
    <p num="p-0039">Similarly, first-level private data set <b>94</b> can comprise data associated with one of a plurality of syndicated loan offerings, access to which is restricted to a subset of the users authorized to access data facility <b>14</b>. Each corresponding loan offering can be administered, for example, by a plurality of bookrunners, and control access by invitees, loan participants, and others to one or more first-level private data sets <b>94</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0040">Second-level private data sets <b>96</b> can comprise data associated with one, and access to which is controlled by, individual bookrunners and the loan participants associated with such bookrunners, including, for example, data representing documents associated with portions of a syndicated loan offering to be administered by a plurality of bookrunners.</p>
    <p num="p-0041">Third- or other-level private data sets <b>98</b> can comprise data associated with individual bookrunners and individual loan participants, service providers, etc., associated with the bookrunners, including, for example, data representing documents associated with agreements or other communications made between such bookrunners and participants or service providers.</p>
    <p num="p-0042">Access to progressively or variously restrictive sets <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> can be provided by any suitable access control codes or devices. For example, a single user identification/password (UUID/pswd) combination applicable to multiple levels of the data structure intended to be accessible to the user (e.g., one or more of all data sets <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>), or a plurality of UUID/pswd combinations, each specific to one or a few data sets <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, etc., can provide authority to a user to access all data stored in global data set <b>92</b>, and to data stored in any one or more of first-, second-, third, etc., level private data sets associated with particular loan offerings, bookrunners, and participant or service provider groups.</p>
    <p num="p-0043">Data structure <b>14</b> can be provided in a unified database located on a single machine or at a single site, and/or in the form of multiple data structures stored in distributed fashion on multiple machines/sites. One or more individual machines/data sites may be operated, for example, by or on behalf of a facilitator of syndicated loan offerings, who provides systems and software to support the secure storage of and access to data related to syndicated loan offerings. For example, in some preferred embodiments of the invention data facility <b>14</b> is operated by a secure data facility service provider employed by or working on behalf of a syndicated loan facilitator, who facilitates offering of one or more syndicated loans by groups of bookrunners and other arrangers.</p>
    <p num="p-0044">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, system <b>100</b> provides for access to data facility <b>14</b> and one or more of data sets <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> in response to receipt of suitable input signals received from input device(s) <b>16</b> associated with data server <b>22</b> and/or any one or more of user systems <b>121</b>, subject to verification of access authority. Bookrunner or deal information, or any other information stored in data structure(s) <b>14</b> may then be provided or otherwise made accessible to the user via output device(s) <b>18</b> associated with user systems <b>121</b> and/or data server(s) <b>22</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0045">Another example of a system architecture suitable for use in implementing the various aspects of the invention is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, control of data structures or facilities <b>14</b> and optionally other functions provided by data server <b>22</b> are distributed between a number of systems <b>22</b>, including for example a plurality of bookrunner systems <b>102</b>, and dedicated data server <b>222</b>. As will be understood by those skilled in the relevant arts, the distributed storage of both common and separate data sets <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> is well understood, and may be accomplished in a wide variety of ways, many of which are now known and others of which will doubtless hereafter be developed. For example, partitioned databases or storage devices may be employed, and/or common storage devices coupled with suitably formatted individual data records, comprising fields identifying the one or more data sets <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> with which any individual data item is associated.</p>
    <p num="p-0046">In both embodiments user stations <b>121</b> comprise invitee workstations <b>104</b>, participant workstations <b>106</b>, bookrunner or other arranger workstations <b>109</b> (identified individually as <b>103</b>, <b>105</b> and <b>109</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and/or as bookrunners <b>102</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and observer or service provider workstations <b>107</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0047">In various embodiments, one or all of the various levels of data sets <b>14</b>, etc., can include relational databases that each store information relating to a particular bookrunner with respect to one or more particular deals; individual databases can include sub-databases with varied levels of restriction or access. Referring to data structure <b>14</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, database or data set <b>92</b> can be implemented as a global database accessible to all authorized users of the system <b>100</b>, and can include as sub-databases deal databases <b>94</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>94</b>-N, each corresponding particular loan offerings or other transactions; bookrunner databases <b>96</b>, each corresponding to and under the direct or indirect control of for example a bookrunner administering the loan offering corresponding to the respective deal data set <b>94</b>; and participant databases <b>96</b>, which are accessible to individual or combinations of participants participating in individual loan offerings under the invitation and control of bookrunners controlling the corresponding bookrunner databases <b>96</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0048">In various embodiments, depending upon the requirements imposed by the party(ies) controlling access to the various data sets <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>98</b>, <b>98</b>, one or more of the data sets, e.g., data set <b>92</b>, may be thought of as “public” or “global” data sets, and others, e.g., data sets <b>94</b>, <b>98</b>, <b>98</b>, as “private” data sets of varying degrees of control. As will be understood by those skilled in the relevant arts, the terms “public”, “private”, and “global” are more or less relative, depending upon hardware, software, and security requirements for access.</p>
    <p num="p-0049">All or any desired portions of data structures <b>14</b> can be understood as relating to individual loans or other transactions, or other uses or purposes altogether. For example, data corresponding to a first transaction can be stored within data set <b>94</b>-<b>1</b>, with data sets related to other transactions stored in data sets <b>94</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . <b>94</b>-N. In the example shown, databases corresponding to N deals have been provided. Likewise, the data set <b>94</b>-<b>1</b> comprises corresponding bookrunner databases <b>96</b>-<b>1</b>-<b>96</b>-M, controlled by the M various bookrunners involved in offering or otherwise administering the transaction, and each of the M bookrunner databases comprises an arbitrary number of data sets accessible to the various individual participants associated with each of the individual bookrunners.</p>
    <p num="p-0050">As will be understood by those skilled in the relevant arts, in many implementations a single database can be provided, with internal partitions or other controls to restrict access to single users, or sets of users, to accomplish the various purposes described herein. For example, a single physical or virtual database can be provide that stores deal data, contact data and comments which are associated with deals and contacts. In such instances, concepts such as visibility mapping or other authorization means can be used to control access to data and/or sets of data—that is, to control which one or more bookrunners, participants, or other users can view and/or authorize access to the data. For example, in some cases a single bookrunner can be authorized to create, store, or authorize access to a piece of data; in other cases multiple bookrunners can share some or all of such authority. For example, it may be desired for all bookrunners, participants, and or other individuals or classes of users to access data related to a contact or a document. In many implementations, it may be advantageous for access to user comments and deal data to be strictly controlled, where for example authority is provided to only one or a few bookrunners or other users. (See, for example, data input item set <b>684</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, described below.)</p>
    <p num="p-0051">System(s) <b>22</b> controlling data structures <b>14</b> may be adapted to operate software or hardware applications adapted to perform or assist in performing a wide variety of functions, including for example providing access to data in storage <b>14</b>, and the various data sets <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> included within or otherwise associated therewith.</p>
    <p num="p-0052">Thus the invention provides systems, methods, and computer programming for processing data pertaining to a syndicated loan offering to be administered by a plurality of bookrunners, where for example the media comprise computer-readable code for causing a computer to receive data (or signals representing such data) identifying a plurality of invitees, where at least one of the invitees is or has been invited by each of a plurality of bookrunners to participate in a syndicated loan offering to be administered by the plurality of bookrunners. Subject to receipt of data indicating acceptance of such invitations by the invitees, the computer can be caused to identify accepting invitees as participants in the syndicated loan offering and associate with data identifying each participant a data-access authorization, where the data-access authorization associated with each respective participant is adapted to permit access by the respective participant to at least a deal data set and a bookrunner data set. The bookrunner data set can be accessible by the bookrunner that invited the participant to participate in the loan, by the respective participant, and by at least one other participant invited by the bookrunner to participate in the loan. The deal data set can be accessible by, for example, all participants participating in the syndicated loan offering.</p>
    <p num="p-0053">The invention further provides such systems, methods, and apparatus where, for example, media according to the invention comprise computer-readable code for causing a computer to, in response to submission to a syndicated loan application server of a data-access authorization received in response to acceptance of an invitation from one of a plurality of bookrunners administering a syndicated loan offering to participate in the syndicated loan offering, either as a loan participant or as a loan arranger, enable access to data stored within at least one of a bookrunner data set and a deal data set, wherein the data-access authorization is adapted to permit access by the respective participant to at least a deal data set and a bookrunner data set, the bookrunner data set is accessible by the bookrunner that invited the participant to participate in the loan and by a plurality of loan participants invited by the bookrunner to participate in the loan, and the deal data is set accessible by all participants and all bookrunners participating in the syndicated loan offering.</p>
    <p num="p-0054">The invention further provides systems, methods, and computer programming for processing data pertaining to a syndicated loan offering to be administered by a plurality of bookrunners in which, for example, media according to the invention can comprise computer-readable code for causing a computer to associate with data received by the computer data identifying the received data as associated with a syndicated loan offering and as associated with one of a plurality of bookrunners administering the syndicated loan offering; store the received data in persistent computer-readable memory, and, subject to verification of authority, allow access to the stored data by at least one of (a) the bookrunner with whom the stored data has been associated, and (b) a participant authorized on behalf of the bookrunner to access the data.</p>
    <p num="p-0055">An example of a use of systems such as systems <b>100</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> in implementing processes according to the invention is provided through the set-up, offering, and other administration of a syndicated loan. A process <b>200</b> for initiating a transaction such as the offering of a syndicated loan by multiple bookrunners <b>102</b>, as initiated by a first such bookrunner (sometimes referred to as a “lead” bookrunner), is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. At <b>202</b> a bookrunner using a suitably-configured user system <b>121</b>, including any suitable input/output systems such as keyboards, pointing devices, display screens, printers, and supporting software/hardware, starts or otherwise accesses an application hosted and running on his/her own user system <b>121</b>, on a server <b>22</b>, or on some combination thereof, according to a distributed-programming protocol. By providing suitably-adapted command input signals, the bookrunner invokes an input command state adapted to elicit and receive input of data required for or useful in initializing a data structure <b>14</b>. For example, input of suitable commands can result in presentation on a display device associated with the bookrunner's user station <b>121</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>109</b> of an interactive user interface <b>600</b> such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0056">Following invocation of a suitable input command state, at <b>202</b> process <b>200</b> continues with initialization of the transaction, e.g., creation of a suitable data structure <b>14</b>. Initialization of a loan or other transaction may involve, for example, providing a name or other identifier suitable for use in uniquely identifying the transaction and any associated data and/or users, such as bookrunners, arrangers, participants, etc., that may ultimately be identified. Further information can involve a transaction size (e.g., an amount of money to be lent, expressed in dollars and/or other currency(ies)), a desired number and types of tranches to be offered, and pools of due diligence and contact information.</p>
    <p num="p-0057">For example, referring to interactive input interface <b>600</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, interactive input items are provided in the form of drop-down menus <b>671</b>, type-in input fields or boxes <b>672</b>, “radio button” option menus <b>673</b>, and option/selection boxes <b>674</b>, such as are commonly provided in contemporary Windows™-style user interfaces. As will be understood by those skilled in the relevant arts, many other user input interfaces suitable for use in implementing embodiments of the invention, including for example those used in LINUX™ or DOS™ operating systems, are now commercially available, and doubtless others will hereafter be developed.</p>
    <p num="p-0058">In the specific example provided in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, user interface <b>600</b> includes type-in input fields <b>672</b> for a deal name <b>601</b> such as a name or other identifier associated with a prospective borrower; radio-button option sets <b>673</b> for designation of a type of transaction data set to be initialized; for file names <b>677</b> corresponding to image data files for representations of borrower, sponsor, or project logos; for guarantor name <b>678</b>, guarantor logo file name <b>679</b>; and for borrower sector identifier <b>680</b>. For inputting responsive information a user of a user system <b>121</b> can for example use a pointing device such as a mouse or trackball to select the box, and thereafter enter appropriate text character strings corresponding to file names or addresses to corresponding input data records, using a keyboard or other character input device.</p>
    <p num="p-0059">For example, as a first step <b>202</b> (referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4A</figref>), a user initializing a transaction data set <b>14</b> can select an option for a type of transaction to be initialized using radio button option set <b>673</b>. Such a user can use a mouse or other pointing device to select one of the options, and thus cause corresponding data to be stored in an input buffer for further processing upon entry of a read execution command as a result of, for example, selection of “Next” command item <b>676</b>. As will be well understood by those skilled in the relevant arts, selection of an option <b>673</b> can be used to set hard or over-ridable default parameters for setting up and/or populating a corresponding data set <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0060">In input field <b>601</b>, in the example shown, a user has typed a character string “ABC Limited”, to be used as an identifier for the proposed transaction. Upon execution of an “Enter” or other suitable input command, as for example by selecting “Next” item <b>676</b>, an application processor executing a suitably-configured input-gathering function will cause the input string “ABC Limited” to be read and stored in a data record in a data structure <b>14</b>. The stored data can thereafter be used to, for example, identify a deal data set <b>94</b> and, based on the identity of the user setting up the transaction and further input choices provided by further input screens, optionally also one or more bookrunner data sets <b>96</b> associated with that deal data set.</p>
    <p num="p-0061">Further, in the example shown, logo input fields <b>677</b>, <b>679</b> are associated with “Browse” command boxes <b>681</b>. As implemented in contemporary Windows™-type user interfaces, selection of a “Browse” command box <b>681</b> causes an application processor (e.g. processor <b>12</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to cause the display associated with user system <b>121</b> to provide further interactive windows adapted for selection of a suitable file name using a hierarchical directory or file tree structure. Such functionality is well understood by those skilled in the relevant arts. Identification by a user of one or more logo file names can cause, as herein described, one or more logos to be displayed on subsequent input/output screens and on associated virtual and/or hard documents, and thus cause corresponding data to be placed into an input buffer for further processing upon entry of an execute command as a result of, for example, selection of “Next” command item <b>676</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0062">Further, in the example shown, pull-down menus <b>671</b> are provided for a number of tranches <b>602</b> and for nationality and industry sector identifiers <b>603</b> associated with the borrower identified at <b>601</b>. A bookrunner or other authorized user can use pull-down menus <b>671</b> to input data by employing a pointing device to select an arrow portion of the item to cause the input control processor to display a list of currently available input options, and to select one of the items of the list, thus causing corresponding data to be placed into an input buffer for further processing upon entry of an execute command as a result of, for example, selection of “Next” command item <b>676</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0063">A number of tranches specified at <b>602</b> can be used for any purpose consistent with the purposes contemplated herein. For example, it is contemplated in one embodiment of the present invention that number of tranches <b>602</b> allows a user to specify the number of bookrunners that would be involved in a deal; each of such tranches may further be separable and saleable by the bookrunner associated with that tranche. Further uses will be immediately understood by those skilled in the relevant arts.</p>
    <p num="p-0064">Borrower nationality <b>603</b> may allow the user to specify a jurisdiction in which the deal is primarily taking place, or for example in which country or other jurisdiction a borrower or other party is domiciled or conducts business. Further input fields may facilitate entry of data such as a relevant industry. For example, a given transaction may involve the chemical industry, as for example where the borrower is in the chemical industry.</p>
    <p num="p-0065">Further, in the example shown, option/selection boxes <b>674</b> are provided for identification of additional bookrunners and/or other arrangers <b>604</b>. By using a pointing device or other suitable input device, a user can select items from “Arrangers” or “Arrangers for this Deal” lists <b>604</b>, and then select “add” or “remove” items <b>675</b> to add identifiers corresponding to desired arrangers to be placed in a buffer for further processing upon entry of an execute command as a result of, for example, selection of “Next” command item <b>676</b>. Thus the initializing bookrunner can determine an initial number of arrangers to be involved in a transaction by placing a desired number of suitable arrangers in “Arrangers for this Deal” box <b>674</b>. From amongst the Arrangers, the initializing bookrunner can nominate which other Arrangers are joint bookrunners.</p>
    <p num="p-0066">Entry and/or selection of desired data to be used in initializing a desired transaction data set <b>14</b> using any or all of such input items and selection of “Next” command <b>676</b> causes input to be read from buffers associated with the respective boxes, and corresponding signals to be sent to the application processor, such as processor <b>12</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for further processing as, for example, described herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0067">As will be understood by those skilled in the relevant arts, the input processes described above are typical of common contemporary input processes, and can be applied similarly to input processes described throughout the remainder of the disclosure herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0068">Thus, referring again to exemplary process <b>200</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, at <b>202</b> an initializing user, such as a first bookrunner or other arranger or administrator, can provide data representing a deal name or other identifier, as for example through use of a data input item <b>601</b>, <b>672</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0069">At <b>204</b> the initializing user, who can be an arranger, initial bookrunner, or any designated authorized administrator or other user, can specify a desired total number of bookrunners (which number can include or exclude the initializing user) to be involved in offering or otherwise administering the proposed transaction, as for example using drop-down menu <b>671</b>, <b>602</b> or input box items <b>672</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. A total number of bookrunners authorized to set up and/or control the deal can be specified initially, as for example according to an initial agreement, and/or the total number can be flexible, such that one or more previously-appointed bookrunners can be authorized to appoint additional bookrunners as needed or desired, or bookrunners may be allowed, under desired conditions, to withdraw. A desired number of bookrunners can be set, and optionally later revised.</p>
    <p num="p-0070">In some presently preferred embodiments of systems and processes according to the invention, it is assumed the initializing user is a bookrunner, and that once the deal has been initialized, the bookrunner structure is fixed.</p>
    <p num="p-0071">At <b>206</b>-<b>210</b>, an authorized party, such as the initializing bookrunner, can specify and/or modify details of the proposed transaction for each of the bookrunners identified at <b>204</b>, and their corresponding levels of access to any shared data, which can for example include deal terms, due diligence data, and/or contact information, can be specified. Such relationship details can be designated by the controlling bookrunner by, for example, entering data corresponding to input items <b>682</b>, <b>683</b>, <b>684</b>, <b>685</b>, <b>686</b>, <b>687</b>, <b>688</b>, <b>689</b>, <b>690</b>, <b>691</b>, <b>692</b>, <b>693</b>. At <b>682</b> and <b>683</b> details of any tranches, including for example amounts and currency types, and names or other identifiers, can be provided.</p>
    <p num="p-0072">For example, at <b>684</b>, using radio button input options, some basic characteristics of data set <b>14</b> can be set. For example, options providing for the sharing of data among any authorized users, including bookrunners and other arrangers, invitees, participants, borrowers, etc., through various levels <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> are provided. In the example shown, the controlling bookrunner (i.e., the bookrunner interfacing with the screen depicted) can determine at the extent to which contact information and/or invitee comments will be shared by joint bookrunners and consequentially, accessible by arrangers and the borrower/advisors.</p>
    <p num="p-0073">As will be understood by those skilled in the relevant arts, commercial transactions such as syndicated loans may be divided into tranches, funds for which may be provided by a number of lenders. Tranche identifiers <b>683</b> set provide for entry of identifiers for each of the number of tranches that were specified by the user at <b>602</b>. Tranche identifiers <b>683</b> may give each of those tranches a simple unique identifier such as using consecutive letters as shown. Tranche detail input fields <b>682</b> provide the ability to specify or select various details about each of the tranches. In the example shown, the user may specify size, in dollars or other currencies, for each tranche, and the currency of the tranche. Additional tranche details may be specified in the corresponding input fields.</p>
    <p num="p-0074">At <b>685</b>, bookrunners/other arrangers are provided the opportunity to arrange various face-to-face or other type meetings to discuss details of the proposal and any negotiable parameters thereof. Details of such meetings my, concurrently or at a later time, be distributed by the processor <b>12</b> or other application processor, on command of the entering arranger. For example, an authorized user can cause e-mail or other RSVP invitations, preferably in electronic format, to be sent to any desired lender invitees, to request their attendance at a borrower and/or bookrunner presentation of the deal.</p>
    <p num="p-0075">Particularly important for most deals is a legal requirement to procure confidentiality agreements from invitees. As seen at <b>690</b>, <b>691</b>, systems according to the invention can provide a wide range of options for pre-determined confidentiality terms, and/or an editable template with over-rideable default terms can be provided (e.g. at <b>692</b>) and/or one or more parties may be enabled to designate that their own, separately prepared document, be used (e.g., by making an appropriate selection at <b>691</b>). Upon subsequent selection of “Next” item <b>694</b>, for example, a further interface screen, adapted for acceptance of input identifying such agreements, can be displayed.</p>
    <p num="p-0076">At <b>208</b> the various bookrunners can specify any desired parameters to be used in controlling their own portions of the book. For example, the bookrunners can specify a number of participants to be invited to underwrite the deal, the levels of their participation, and the levels and types of data to be shared between them; and thereby, among other tasks, designate parameters used in managing data set <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0077">A screen suitable for eliciting input useable for designating individual lender invitees to participate in the proposed transaction, and to associate the invitees with particular bookrunners, is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, a pool of bookrunners to administer a proposed loan transaction and a pool of lenders to be invited to participate in the transaction has been identified, as for example by an initiating user who has initiated a transaction using processes such as those described above. A list of invitees is shown at <b>1601</b>. At <b>1603</b>, there is associated with each identified invitee a drop-down menu listing each currently-designated bookrunner. If a bookrunner has nominated distribution staff in more than one city, there is an additional option to associate the invitee with a particular syndication office (city) of the relevant bookrunner. The user using the interface can assign invitees to particular bookrunners by selecting one of pull down items <b>1605</b> and selecting the desired bookrunner to be associated with (e.g., to interact with) the respective invitee. In the example shown, for example, a number of invitee lenders, including Allied Irish Banks, Aozora Bank, Bayern LB, etc., are associated with bookrunner Credit Suisse Hong Kong, the main contacts/administrators (bookrunner contacts) of which are identified as Jonathan Yip and Jonathan Tham. Likewise, invitees Bank of America and GE Capital have been assigned to bookrunner Citigroup, etc. At <b>1607</b> a summary of the number of invitees assigned to or otherwise associated with the identified bookrunners is provided, as an aide to the administrator in distributing assignments. A usual practice is to have an equal number of invitees assigned each bookrunner.</p>
    <p num="p-0078">When the user is satisfied with the assignments of the various invitees at <b>1601</b> to corresponding bookrunners at <b>1603</b>, the user can select “Update” execution/command item <b>1609</b>, and corresponding data held in associated buffers can be written to data structure <b>14</b>, to update information stored therein accordingly.</p>
    <p num="p-0079">When an invitee has been assigned to a bookrunner, and wishes to consider whether to accept participation in the transaction, the invitee can invoke suitably-adapted commands in order to access an interface comprising a summary of relevant data, drawn from various data sets <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> of data structure <b>14</b>. Such interface can present text and images representing such information, and/or can comprise links to data structures representing relevant documents and other data.</p>
    <p num="p-0080">An example of an interface useful for allowing an invitee or other user to review summary information is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. Signals useful in providing such an interface can be provided, for example, by a processor such as processor <b>12</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> executing suitably-configured software, for display on an output device associated with a user system <b>121</b>, such as an invitee or participant user screen <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>. Such an interface can be accessed by a user of a system <b>121</b> upon entry of suitable authentication or authorization data, such as for example a suitable user identification code and password.</p>
    <p num="p-0081">For example, a potential lender invited by a bookrunner to participate in a proposed syndicated loan transaction can receive a suitably configured communication, such as an e-mail or fax, generated by system <b>22</b> or other suitably-configured processor. Such communication(s) can provide for the secure transmission of data-access authorization means such as authorization codes, so that the targeted invitee can thereafter, using a user system <b>121</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, access an Internet web portal or other suitable interface process and invoke commands resulting in the display of an interface screen such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. As will be understood by those skilled in the relevant arts, such data-access authorizations can expressly and/or implicitly identify both the requesting user (e.g., an invitee, participant, or bookrunner) and the bookrunner with whom the requesting user is associated.</p>
    <p num="p-0082">Preferred systems according to the invention provide for the automatic generation of invitations extended to prospective lenders, using for example list merge processes such as mail-merge functions commonly available in contemporary word processing and spreadsheet programs. For example, suitably-flagged e-mail, facsimile, and/or other contact data can be retrieved from applicable portions of data structure(s) <b>14</b>, and merged into a list for use in addressing e-mails, facsimiles, or other means for communicating invitations.</p>
    <p num="p-0083">In such embodiments a user such as a bookrunner preparing such invitations, may be enabled to edit such invitations, either individually or in groups, prior to sending. Opportunities for such editing can be provided, for example, through the use of suitably-adapted user interface screens comprising both data input and command execution items.</p>
    <p num="p-0084">Information displayed on an interface such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> can comprise any desired information, such as any information that may be useful to the invitee in determining whether to participate in the proposed transaction. Any or all of such information can, for example, be drawn from any one or more of levels <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> of data structure(s) <b>14</b>, and/or from public sources such as the Internet, based on criteria such as the association of the invitee accessing the screen with his/her assigned bookrunner, designations of data-sharing options made by the bookrunner or other system administrator using interfaces such as those shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4C and 4D</figref>, etc., as represented by the association of suitable flags and other data with data identifying the individual invitee.</p>
    <p num="p-0085">In the example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, information including logos <b>1607</b>, <b>1608</b>, <b>1609</b>, document images accessible through links <b>1610</b>, <b>1611</b>, <b>1614</b> and one or more of contact data sets associated with links <b>1612</b> can be stored in a highest-level (most widely accessible) data set <b>92</b>. Other information, including for example any or all contact information and document images corresponding to related information can be stored in any one or more of corresponding deal data sets <b>94</b>, bookrunner data sets <b>96</b>, or private data sets <b>98</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0086">Thus some or all of the information available to an invitee via an interface such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> may be accessible to all invitees, bookrunners, arrangers, borrowers, underwriters, lenders, service providers, and other participants and observers authorized to access system <b>22</b>; or may be accessible only by the individual invitee, or by invitees assigned to the same bookrunner, etc.</p>
    <p num="p-0087">Thus in various embodiments the invention provides systems, process, and computer-readable media useful for causing a computer to, in response to submission to a syndicated loan application server of a data-access authorization received in response to acceptance of an invitation from one of a plurality of bookrunners administering a syndicated loan offering to participate in the syndicated loan offering, either as a loan participant or as a loan arranger, access to data stored within at least one of a bookrunner data set and a deal data set; wherein the data-access authorization is adapted to permit access by the respective participant to at least a deal data set and a bookrunner data set, the bookrunner data set is accessible by the bookrunner that invited the participant to participate in the loan and by a plurality of loan participants invited by the bookrunner to participate in the loan, and the deal data is set accessible by all participants and all bookrunners participating in the syndicated loan offering.</p>
    <p num="p-0088">In particular, the sharing of information with an invitee in such fashion can be restricted to situations in which the invitee has indicated an interest in participating in the transaction; that is, in which the invitee, by committing to participate, has been identified by the system as a loan participant.</p>
    <p num="p-0089">As will be understood by those skilled in the relevant arts, data displayed or otherwise made available through an interface such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> can be drawn from any suitable source(s), and can be stored, accessed, and processed in any desired manner. For example, logos <b>1607</b>, <b>1608</b>, <b>1609</b> can be stored as image files in any suitable format, and inserted in the interface screen using java scripts or other suitable devices. Likewise, text items <b>1650</b>, <b>1610</b>, <b>1611</b>, etc. can comprise hypertext links to additional data, either in character or image format, or in any other suitable format.</p>
    <p num="p-0090">Thus the invention provides systems, and computer media such as suitably-configured software coding, useful for processing data pertaining to a syndicated loan offering or other transaction to be administered, for example, by a plurality of bookrunners, the medium comprising computer-readable code embodied therein for causing a computer to receive data signals (e.g., input requests from one or more user systems <b>121</b> identifying a plurality of invitees, at least one of the invitees invited by each of a plurality of bookrunners to participate in a syndicated loan offering to be administered by the plurality of bookrunners; and, subject to receipt of data indicating acceptance of such invitations by the invitees, identify accepting invitees as participants in the syndicated loan offering and associate with data identifying each participant a data-access authorization. The data-access authorization can be associated with each respective participant adapted to permit access by the respective participant to at least a deal data set and a bookrunner data set, where the bookrunner data set is accessible by the bookrunner that invited the participant to participate in the loan, by the respective participant, and by at least one other participant invited by the bookrunner to participate in the loan; and the deal data set is accessible by all participants participating in the syndicated loan offering.</p>
    <p num="p-0091">Thus too the invention provides such computer-readable media adapted for causing a computer to, subject to verification of data representing a request from an authorized participant, provide access to data stored within at least one of a bookrunner data set and a deal data set.</p>
    <p num="p-0092"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> show exemplary user interfaces for viewing and managing bookrunner/invitee/participant information and relationships in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Such interfaces can be referred to as “Bookrunning Pages”. For purposes of illustration, the interface screens shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> comprise several of the same types of input devices shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-D</figref> and described above.</p>
    <p num="p-0093">Screen <b>1500</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> echoes a previously-designated deal identifier at <b>1701</b>, and confirms at <b>1702</b> that the syndicated loan data management application is operating in a bookrunner administration state. At <b>1705</b> confirmation is provided, in the form of a graphic representation of the bookrunner's logo, of the identity of the bookrunner currently using the system to manage invitees and/or loan participants. Below confirmation <b>1705</b> is provided a listing of invitees assigned to the bookrunner and an indication of their status with respect to the proposed loan transaction. For example, an invitee “Société Générale” is indicated to have committed to the transaction, and therefore to have become a participant, to the extent of committing 6 million dollars (or other applicable currency) to the deal. The actual amount lent by the participant can depend on what is allocated by the bookrunner at the end of the deal; in the case of an oversubscribed position it can be less than the commitment amount of 6 million. The total amount of the deal is indicated at <b>1701</b> to be 100 million dollars. Invitee “Credit Europe Bank” has indicated an interest in providing up to 5 million dollars of the loan. Invitee “Caixa Geral de Depósitos” has been invited and has accepted the confidentiality agreement, while “ABN AMRO” has been invited, but has not accepted the confidentiality agreement.</p>
    <p num="p-0094">Items <b>1704</b> identifying the various invitees can be provided in the form of hypertext links, selection of which by the bookrunner user, as will be understood by those skilled in the relevant arts, results in display in area <b>1706</b> of data related to the selected invitee. For example, in the example shown, item <b>1704</b> corresponding to participant “Société Générale” has been selected, resulting in display of a number of information items pertaining to the deal status of that participant, and links to further data relating to that invitee/participant. At <b>1708</b>, boldface script is used to confirm that the invitee/participant has committed to provide funds in the amount 6 million dollars (and therefore has been accorded the status of a loan participant). Radio button input options <b>673</b> enable the reviewing bookrunner to change the status of the participant or an invitee. At <b>1707</b>, information pertaining to contacts associated with the participant is provided, with fields <b>672</b> for modification of data. Likewise, one or more of the displayed text items can be provided in the form of hypertext links, selection of which can result in display of an interactive interface adapted for modification of corresponding participant/invitee data.</p>
    <p num="p-0095">When the bookrunner information interface of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is initially presented to a user, the right-hand side of the user interface comprising data items <b>1704</b>, <b>1705</b> may be blank. The user may use bookrunner selector, status selector, and find selector <b>1710</b> to populate the right-hand side of the screen. The bookrunner selector is available on multiple bookrunner deals and where invited contacts are viewable by all bookrunners. The Bookrunner selector allows the user to choose one or all bookrunners or a particular bookrunner for a designated transaction. The selection in using bookrunner selector <b>1710</b> specifies the various invitees, participants, and bookrunners whose information may be viewable on the right-hand side of the screen and may be shown in committed list <b>1712</b>, interested list <b>1714</b>, or invited list(s) <b>1715</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0096">Status selector <b>1710</b> allows the user to specify whether they would like to be able to see all of the invitees for the one or more bookrunners selected, or those that have declined, committed, or probable commitments, have been invited, or all excluding those that have declined. These options are meant to be exemplary only and other statuses for invitees may be possible in other embodiments, and may be selectable using status selector <b>1710</b>. Find selector <b>1710</b> may invoke a list that allows a user to select a term defined, or may be, for example a text box that allows a user to specify a search for an invitee contact name or invitee bank name. For example, a user may specify they would like to find a given contact. The right-hand side <b>1706</b> of the user interface may be populated only with the invitee that has the contact that was entered in the find selector <b>1710</b>. As a further example, a user may select to see all bookrunners using bookrunner selector <b>1710</b>, invitees of all statuses using status the selector, and may leave the find selector blank. This would result in the right-hand side of the screen being populated with one of the bookrunners or participants in the deal. This would also result in committed list <b>1712</b> being populated as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, probable commitment list <b>1714</b> being populated as shown, and invited list <b>1715</b> being populated as shown.</p>
    <p num="p-0097">Participant or invitee information field <b>1706</b> may provide information related to the participant/invitee that is selected from committed list <b>1712</b>, interested list <b>1714</b>, or invited list <b>1715</b>, including specified in participant/invitee name <b>1720</b>. This may include addresses of the invitee or participant, contact information, subsidiaries and related parties, and other information. It is to be understood that although multiple pieces of information are shown in participant/invitee field <b>1706</b>, these are exemplary only and there may be other information that is presented or some of the present information may be removed.</p>
    <p num="p-0098">At <b>210</b> in process <b>200</b>, any additional deal details can be specified, and/or relationships between bookrunners, arrangers, invitees, and participants can be revisited or modified. Data relating to such details may for example include the extent of sharing of contacts and comments among multiple bookrunners. Deal details may further include, for example:</p>
    <p num="p-0099">(1) Specifying the positions of bookrunners and arrangers. This can be important where, for example, it is advantageous to identify a senior bookrunner by, for example, placing the bank's logo in a prominent (top left side) or otherwise noticeable position on a user interface screen, so that others may easily identify that bookrunner as the senior “prestigious” bookrunner.
<br>
(2) The manner in and terms under which confidentiality and other agreements are to be executed. This is important as bookrunners or other parties typically owe a legal duty of confidentiality to their borrower clients etc.
<br>
(3) The industry sector and nationality of the borrower. This can be useful so that, for example, invitees can have a quick idea of the where borrowed funds intend to be used as each bank has credit limits based on sector and borrower nationality. Deal details may be specified by a user or by system <b>22</b>.
</p>
    <p num="p-0100">At <b>212</b> the deal, and all details that have been provided, can be saved into a database or storage such as data structure <b>14</b>, and the databases or data sets stored in association therewith. The information collected in process <b>200</b> having been saved, an information set <b>14</b> may be created after <b>212</b>, and updated, modified, and manipulated as desired for completing the deal.</p>
    <p num="p-0101">It is to be understood processes, such as process <b>200</b>, in accordance with the invention may proceed wholly or partially automatically, or may proceed wholly or partially as a result of a user interacting with system <b>100</b>, or both. A user may, for example click a mouse button, select an icon or a command button, or provide any other input to system <b>100</b>; or a processor such as processor <b>12</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may use any input and/or default data to automatically initiate or complete various processes and process steps.</p>
    <p num="p-0102">Thus process <b>200</b> can begin, for example, with identification of a loan to be syndicated and of a first bookrunner <b>103</b>. Having been established as such, a bookrunner <b>103</b> can take a variety of actions, including for example authorization of any number of additional bookrunners <b>105</b>, <b>109</b>. Bookrunner(s) <b>102</b> can for example contact one or more potential participants <b>104</b> (i.e., “invitees”), as indicated at <b>101</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and invite them to take part in underwriting and/or participating in the proposed loan. Bookrunner(s) <b>102</b> may further contact invitees or participants by any suitable means, including for example telephone, SMS, text messaging, e-mail, fax, letter, or other means.</p>
    <p num="p-0103">Invitees who commit to a deal can be granted, by their respective inviting bookrunners <b>102</b>, status as participants <b>106</b>, as indicated at <b>111</b>. Participant status can provide, for example, authority for various levels of access to databases of data representing documents and other information associated with the proposed deal or loan.</p>
    <p num="p-0104">For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, participants <b>106</b> can be granted access to (i) database(s) <b>14</b>, <b>108</b>, associated with and controlled by a respective bookrunner <b>102</b>; and/or (ii) to shared database(s) <b>14</b>, <b>110</b>. Each of databases <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> can contain data representing a wide variety of information associated with proposed loans, including for example all relevant documents, and all regulatory and accounting information.</p>
    <p num="p-0105">The interface such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> can be used to enable an authorized user such as a bookrunner to set and modify, or otherwise manage, authorizations, or permissions, for various bookrunners, arrangers and other deal parties to access data stored in data structure(s) <b>14</b>, and the manner in which such information is accessed. For example, in the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an authorized bookrunner is enabled to review and modify permissions <b>1910</b> for fellow bookrunners “Bookrunner Bank” and “ABN AMRO”, and for borrower “SPV”.</p>
    <p num="p-0106">Among permissions the authorized user is enabled to set or modify, in the example shown, are privileges related to “Update All”, “Update Docs”, “View Docs”, “Synd Status”, “View All,”, and “Email Notes”, with respect to one or more bookrunners. The corresponding permissions can be toggled on or off, or otherwise set by, for example, selecting respective “check” box authorizations boxes.</p>
    <p num="p-0107">For example, enabling “Update All” permission <b>1912</b> by, for example, selecting the check box item associated with the descriptive text “Update All” sets appropriate data flags for granting the corresponding participant, bookrunner, or other party to edit or revise all data, documentary or otherwise the party is authorized to access; for example, all documents associated with a particular deal. Enabling “Update Docs” permission gives the corresponding party to update documents related to the deal, such as proposed agreements, prospectuses, etc. “Synd Status” enables the party to access the Syndication Status Report in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0108">“Bookrunner” pulldown menus <b>1914</b> are provided for identification of arranger contacts who are to be assigned distribution roles; that is, to be designated as bookrunners that are visible to invited contacts. For example, a nominated individual, usually as a loan sales person, may be given a number which it will be determine there ranking for invitees to contact. Usually, not all arranger contacts will have such roles.</p>
    <p num="p-0109">The user of an interface such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> can be enabled to perform further management functions through provision of, for example, links <b>1920</b> to interface screens or other functionality related to bookrunner contacts. For example, selecting hypertext link <b>1920</b> “Add Bookrunner Bank contact” can cause a further interactive interface to be displayed, along with functionality allowing the authorized user to add contacts, invitees, or others to the list of such contacts, etc., associated with the corresponding bookrunner.</p>
    <p num="p-0110">In some embodiments, individual participants <b>106</b> are associated solely with individual bookrunners <b>102</b>, as shown in the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In such embodiments the individual participants <b>106</b> may for example be authorized to access only bookrunner databases <b>108</b> controlled by their corresponding bookrunners. In other embodiments individual participants <b>106</b> may be associated with multiple bookrunners <b>102</b>, and optionally authorized to access bookrunner databases <b>108</b> controlled by each of the corresponding multiple bookrunners.</p>
    <p num="p-0111">Non-participating users <b>107</b>, which can include for example service providers and other interested parties such as borrowers, lenders, lawyers, auditors, regulators, etc., can be granted authority to access one or more bookrunner databases <b>102</b> and/or shared databases <b>108</b>, or any or all of corresponding data sets <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0112">A significant advantage provided by systems and processes according to the invention is that of enabling consolidated reporting of syndication status by multiple bookrunners and widespread reviewing of such syndication status reports by multiple parties, including for example by arrangers <b>106</b>, bookrunners <b>102</b> and the borrower. For example, each of arrangers <b>106</b> and bookrunners <b>102</b> can be enabled to access, and contribute to, a combined syndication status report, so that the exact status of the loan proposal may be reviewed at any moment, in real time, by any authorized bookrunner, arranger, or other system user. Administrative status reports, participant commitment reports, and reports comprising statistics related to reasons cited by invitees for declining to participate in loan offerings are further examples of reports that can be built, modified, and reviewed by multiple parties in accordance with the invention. Such reports can be maintained and stored wholly or partially in shared database <b>110</b>, and/or in relevant portions in one or more bookrunner databases <b>108</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0113">A particularly advantageous report enabled by the invention is the combined loan syndication status report. The provision of such reports in accordance with the invention enables the exact status of the loan proposal to be reviewed at any moment, in real time, by any authorized bookrunner, arranger, or other authorized user of a data storage/transaction processing system according to the invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0114">Examples of combined loan syndication status reports in accordance with the invention are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9F</figref>. Access to displays showing such reports, and/or to image or hard-copy versions of such a report, may be gained through user interfaces such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0115">An interface such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> may be provided to a user or users of a system <b>100</b> at any point in the initiation or administration of a transaction such as a syndicated loan offering. The number and types of options presented by the interface can be made dependent upon the identity of or authorizations associated with the viewing user, and/or the status of the corresponding deal. In the example shown, interface <b>3500</b> has been assembled by a processor <b>12</b> upon the request of and for presentation to a bookrunner following the initialization of a syndicated loan transaction. Processing options offered to the user include various activities, such as originating, modifying, or otherwise managing data and processes related to setting up the loan, and identifying and inviting prospective participants to participate in the offering; access to various reports, including for example the status of the syndicated transaction, reports related to bookrunning or contact activities, reports on the confidentiality status of various arrangers, borrowers, and participants, and access to support documentation; and other activities, including the creation of new deals/deal data structures by duplicating existing information sets, archiving documents, checking e-mail or other communications patterns, etc.</p>
    <p num="p-0116">Selection of item <b>3501</b> “Syndication Status” of interface <b>3500</b> can result in the presentation of a report interface, or other output, comprising data related to the status of the syndicated offering. For example, selection of an item <b>3501</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> by an authorized user can cause processor <b>12</b> to access all applicable data structures <b>14</b>, including any applicable data sets <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>, to gather data responsive to the request at the requested time, and to present, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, a report summarizing at <b>3002</b> the number of committed participants and the level of their commitment (i.e., the monetary value of their individual and/or combined commitments); at <b>3004</b> the number of invited participants and their status; at <b>3006</b> the identities of designated bookrunners and other arrangers, and the amount of funds committed by them and/or participants associated with them; at <b>3008</b> the identities and other information pertaining to committed participants, including, at <b>3009</b>, the date upon which such participants executed confidentiality agreements, the identity of the responsible bookrunner; at <b>3010</b> invitees believed to be likely to commit; and at <b>3012</b> participants who have not yet been fully processed as committed, but who have signed confidentiality agreements, verbally agreed to participate, etc.</p>
    <p num="p-0117">A draft allocations tool is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> can be accessed by an authorized user by, for example, activating a suitably-configured hypertext link provided in an interface such as those shown in either of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> or <b>9</b>A.</p>
    <p num="p-0118">The transaction report shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> can be referred to as an Allocation Report. Commitment levels; method of acceptance of invitation; time and date of acceptance; title, role, or status; and deal status are shown at <b>3602</b>, <b>3604</b>, <b>3606</b>, <b>3608</b>, <b>3609</b>, and <b>3610</b>, respectively. An authorized viewer using such an interface can change corresponding data using input fields <b>672</b>, <b>673</b>, etc., as described. In the example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, the report shows both commitment and allocation levels, which need not be the same. For example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> arrangers “Commerzbank”, “RZB”, and “Standard Bank” have each committed to 7.5 million US dollars, but have been allocated only 7, 3, and 7 million US dollars, respectively.</p>
    <p num="p-0119">Further examples of combined transaction status reports referred to as work flow tool to draft allocations, e.g. View Allocations and Notify Allocations respectively, are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9C-9D</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref> can be accessed by an authorized user by, for example, activating a suitably-configured hypertext link provided in an interface such as those shown in either of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, <b>9</b>A, or <b>9</b>B. The report shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref> summarizes allocation data such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, but in optionally uneditable format.</p>
    <p num="p-0120">A further example of a combined transaction status report is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref>. The interface shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref> can be accessed by an authorized user by, for example, activating a suitably-configured hypertext link provided in an interface such as those shown in either of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, <b>9</b>A, or <b>9</b>B. The interface/report shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref> summarizes currently-selected options for methods of notifying lenders and other system users of deal allocations, and at <b>3702</b>, <b>3704</b> allows modification of those options. As shown at <b>3706</b>, security of allocation records can be protected though the use of appropriately-configured access codes, which may the same as or different than those used by the user for access to other data and/or functionality stored on system <b>100</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0121">A further example of a combined transaction status report is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9E</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9E</figref> can be accessed by an authorized user by, for example, activating a suitably-configured hypertext link provided in an interface such as those shown in either of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> or <b>9</b>A.</p>
    <p num="p-0122">The transaction report shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9E</figref> can be referred to as a Commitment Report. Lender name; contact identifiers; commitment levels; time and date of acceptance; title, role, or status; fee information, administrative and tax form information, with hypertext links to further information, are provided <b>3802</b>, <b>3804</b>, <b>3806</b>, <b>3808</b>, <b>3809</b>, <b>3610</b>, and <b>3812</b> respectively. In the example shown, commitment data is sorted according to loan tranche. An authorized viewer using such an interface can change corresponding data using input fields by, for example, selecting any of the corresponding links and using input devices <b>672</b>, <b>673</b>, etc., as described from subsequently-presented interactive interfaces.</p>
    <p num="p-0123">A further example of a combined transaction status report is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9F</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9F</figref> can be accessed by an authorized user by, for example, activating a suitably-configured hypertext link provided in an interface such as those shown in either of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> or <b>9</b>A.</p>
    <p num="p-0124">The transaction report shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9F</figref> shows data indicating reasons given by invitees who have declined to participate in the proposed transaction for declining to participate. As will be understood by those skilled in the relevant arts, declining invitees can be provided with suitably-adapted input devices, such as radio button option lists, which enable them to select one or more reasons for declining to participate. At the request of a curious bookrunner, borrower, or other party, processor <b>12</b> can access and collate such data, and assemble suitable output data for the presentation of an appropriate screen, such as that shown in the Figure.</p>
    <p num="p-0125">The collection and presentation of data representing reasons that prospective lenders have declined to participate in a syndicated loan transaction can be help arrangers, borrowers, and others to understand why deals have been declined, which may, in turn, lead for example to repricing or restructuring of current or subsequent deals, and thus can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the syndicated loan process.</p>
    <p num="p-0126">Reports such as those shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9F</figref> can be particularly useful because they are available, in uniform or specially-tailored formats, to any and all authorized parties, and because they automatically pull together information that previously may only have been available on separate client-server sole bookrunner systems; they therefore make available consolidated information provided by a wide variety of participants and other users, and current to the moment of the request. They thus aid immeasurably in the understanding of the current overall status of a transaction, and in the identification of next steps to be undertaken in order to further the transaction. In particular, it has been found advantageous to make such reports available, via network interface, to borrowers.</p>
    <p num="p-0127">Such reports eliminate or reduce great amounts of paper work and communications times, and enable more rapid and informed decision making.</p>
    <p num="p-0128">A further particularly advantageous feature of the assembly and provision of such information is that, when stored, processed, and assembled in the manner described it may be made available to borrowers, lenders, arrangers, and others in a wide variety of convenient or useful formats: as graphic and/or active content displayed on a screen, in hard copy as printed reports, as image data in .pdf or other files, and as data formatted for use by third-party applications such as spreadsheets. For example, data use to compile such reports can be made available to users in Excel™ format, etc.</p>
    <p num="p-0129">A further advantage is that such information can be used in the automated generation of printed closing documents, and other documents necessary for completing and/or memorializing a transaction.</p>
    <p num="p-0130">Thus the invention provides, among other features, processes and computer-executable media useful for processing data pertaining to syndicated loan offerings to be administered by a plurality of bookrunners, the media comprising computer-readable code embodied therein for causing a computer to, upon entry of a suitably-adapted execution command from a borrower input system such as a user system <b>121</b> operated by an authorized borrower, access data corresponding to the status of a plurality of criteria relating to the offering of the syndicated loan, access to which data is controlled by a plurality of bookrunners administering the syndicated loan offering; and to display on an output device associated with the borrower input system, in human-readable form, information indicating said status.</p>
    <p num="p-0131">The invention further provides processes and computer-executable media useful for causing a computer, upon entry of an execution command from a borrower or other input system, output data corresponding to the status of a plurality of criteria relating to the offering of the syndicated loan in a spreadsheet format.</p>
    <p num="p-0132">Examples of administrative status reports provided by a system <b>100</b> in accordance with the invention are provided in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-10D</figref>. Access to displays or other forms of such reports may be gained through a user interface such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Invocation of a suitably-configured command by an authorized user can result, for example, in display of information such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0133">Administrative details reports such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> can summarize data useful, for example in contacting parties responsible for attending to various tasks and/or administrative details of a transaction, or doing so on behalf of individual parties. For example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> administrative details relating to a participant or borrower “National City Funds” are shown, including contact information for a booking office, publicity information, and payment instructions, etc. Further information on a number of details is available via hypertext links <b>3520</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0134">For example, activation of link <b>3522</b> “Payment Instructions” can result in the presentation of an interface such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, which provides details of payment instructions for a borrower “National City Funds.” Input items <b>3504</b> adapted for designation of payment currency and other information is presented. Additional details may be entered, or existing details deleted or modified, by an authorized viewer.</p>
    <p num="p-0135">As previously mentioned, a further advantage offered by the invention is the use of data stored in the various data sets <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>, etc., of data structure(s) <b>14</b> is that such information can be used in the automated generation of printed closing documents, and other documents necessary for completing and/or memorializing a transaction. For example, contact information including addresses, commitment amounts, confidentiality terms, fee agreements, and the like can be used to construct contracts, insurance forms, accounting forms, and various reports for signature and authentication, etc.</p>
    <p num="p-0136">A particularly useful feature of such functionality is the storage in any of the various data structure(s) <b>14</b> of document templates comprising data representing text and formatting data suitable for the printing of standardized language, into which data strings representing deal- or party-specific information can be merged, so that at display and/or printing complete, custom-drafted documents can be prepared.</p>
    <p num="p-0137">Thus in various embodiments the invention provides computer-readable media, systems, and processes for the display on an output device associated with at least one client input system <b>121</b>, in human-readable form, of information pertaining to at least one syndicated loan offering to be administered by a plurality of bookrunners, and at least one input item adapted to facilitate input by the user of data corresponding to at least one type of solicited input data; and, upon entry of an input execution command by a user of the at least one client input system, the reading data input by the user corresponding to the at least one type of solicited input data; upon entry of a document assembly execution command by a user of the same or another client input system, the compilation of a document output data set, the document output data set compiled using the input data corresponding to the at least one type of solicited input data, and at least one document template data set, the document template data set comprising data representing standard text to be incorporated as a part of one or more documents useful in closing the syndicated loan offering; and the compiled document data set adapted for use by at least one output device to provide at least one human-readable rendering of each of a plurality of such documents.</p>
    <p num="p-0138">That is, data corresponding to proforma templates can be provided, and populated at or before output with details of participants and various aspects of the deal at issue, including closing instructions and terms consistent with them. Such forms can be, for example, standardized for preparation according to one or more specific currencies during the course of a deal, with, where appropriate, automatic translation of amounts stated in other currencies in accordance with any desired pre-stored benchmarks, or benchmarks retrieved from external sources at the time of document preparation.</p>
    <p num="p-0139">Document output data sets according to such aspects of the invention can be compiled using, in addition to such input data and such document template data sets, data corresponding to solicited input data provided by users other than the user who provided the document assembly execution command.</p>
    <p num="p-0140">Such documents can be output in editable format (e.g., in format suitable for processing using a commercial word processing program such as Microsoft Word™, or in image format such as editable or non-editable .pdf or .jpeg form.</p>
    <p num="p-0141">As previously noted, the invention further provides for the presentation on various interface and other display screens, and on various output reports, of logos and other images associated with various parties to transactions, including for example lenders, arrangers, and administrators.</p>
    <p num="p-0142">As is understood by those familiar with the implementation of commercial transactions such as syndicated loans, there can be significant perceived value in the relative placement of logos associated with various entities in display screens, reports, and the like. The invention enables unprecedented flexibility in the placement of logos, and particularly the relative placement of individual logos within groups of simultaneously-displayed logos, on displays, reports, etc.</p>
    <p num="p-0143">For example, as previously described a plurality of graphic display items, e.g., logos, related to various parties associated with a syndicated loan offering are shown in the bookrunner summary interface is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. In a typical commercial transaction of this type, the most important of the arrangers involved, or those having the most leverage within the context of the given transaction, are accorded the most prestigious display location: usually, the highest, rightmost location. In the example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, for example, the most important parties are given positions in topmost row <b>1607</b>, and the largest image size. The invention enables authorized users to specify the placement of logos on such displays, and in other displays and reports, with large degree of flexibility: both the up-down and left-right positioning, and, in some embodiments, the sizing of such logos.</p>
    <p num="p-0144">Thus the invention provides methods, systems, and computer programming for causing a computer to display, in human-readable or otherwise discernable form, information pertaining to a transaction such as a syndicated loan offering to be administered by a plurality of bookrunners, the information comprising at least one graphic display item such as a graphic representation of a logo identifying each of a plurality of parties, such as lenders, borrowers, or underwriters, associated with the syndicated loan offering; wherein the plurality of graphic display items is arrangeable in at least a two-dimensional array, the relative position of the graphical display items within at least one of the dimensions selectable by an administrator of the syndicated loan offering.</p>
    <p num="p-0145">As previously mentioned, such graphic data can be drawn from any suitable local or remote source(s), and can be stored, accessed, and processed in any desired manner. For example, data representing logos can be stored as image files in any suitable format, and inserted in the interface screen using java scripts or other suitable devices.</p>
    <p num="p-0146"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a schematic flow diagram of an embodiment <b>250</b> of a process for setting data-access authorizations in accordance with the invention, such authorizations being useful, for example, for granting or otherwise controlling access by invitees, participants, borrowers, bookrunners, and other users of systems <b>100</b> to desired or appropriate portions of data structure(s) <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0147">At <b>252</b> an authorized user such as a lead or initiating bookrunner, or other arranger, logs on or otherwise gains access to the syndicated loan processing system <b>100</b>. Such a user may be, for example, an administrator of system <b>100</b>, or a bookrunner seeking to set authorization levels for participants and/or invitees in the list of prospective lenders assigned to the bookrunner. Access may be gained, for example, through the use of an interactive login screen where the user is required to provide a name and password to access system <b>100</b>. In addition to or in lieu of such well-understood login processes, other ways of gaining access to a system, such as through digital signatures, fingerprint scanning, and/or the use of other biometrics or security devices may be used, and are considered within the scope of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0148">If at <b>254</b> the authorized user determines that there are lower-level data set authorizations to be set (e.g., to deal data sets or global data sets), then at <b>256</b> one or more corresponding databases may be designated for action. Such database(s) may be selected from a list of databases and may include, for example, an all-invitees database, an all-participants database, a private or public database, a global database or any other specific or shared database(s) desired by the selecting user, such as data sets <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>, etc, described herein. A database(s) available to the user for designation at <b>256</b> may vary depending on the authority possessed by the accessing user; for example, whether the access gained at <b>252</b> is by an administrator or a bookrunner.</p>
    <p num="p-0149">At <b>258</b> users to whom authorization criteria are to apply for the data sets designated at <b>256</b> may be designated. Such users can for example include all users of the selected database(s), or specific users or subsets of users. Thus for example there can be set a single, or common, authorization criteria (e.g., access code) for each of the selected data sets, individual access codes specific to individual users for all access required by the users, or distinct codes for each user-data set combination to be authorized.</p>
    <p num="p-0150">At <b>260</b> an inquiry can be as to made whether any higher-level (i.e., more restrictive, as for example bookrunner-group specific) authorizations are to be set. If such authorizations are to be set, then at <b>262</b>, at least one user and a corresponding data set may be selected to set authorization criteria for. One or more users may be selected, all invitees may be selected, all participants may be selected, all bookrunners may be selected, or administrators or any other subset of the users may be selected.</p>
    <p num="p-0151">At <b>264</b> authorization criteria suitable for use by, for example, processor <b>12</b> in authorizing access to any designated data sets are set for any designated users. For example, sufficiently secure coded data are stored in association with data records identifying both the authorized user(s) and the corresponding data set(s). Thereafter the access codes can be securely communicated to the affected users for use in accessing desired and authorized data.</p>
    <p num="p-0152">In proposing and managing transactions such as the offering of syndicated loans, the maintenance, preservation, and control of information can be of extreme importance, and in some circumstances this is particularly true of information useful for establishing and/or maintaining communications with parties involved in the transaction. Thus among the many beneficial features offered by the invention is a mechanism for preserving such contact information entered or maintained by, or otherwise associated with, one or more individual system users. Such a feature is particularly useful when, for example, a user such as an arranger, lender, borrower, or service provider initiates a process of deleting a set of contact data.</p>
    <p num="p-0153"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a schematic flow diagram of an embodiment of a process for preserving contact information in accordance with such features of the invention. Process <b>400</b> provides a method for deleting information that is stored in one or more of data set(s) <b>14</b>. In particular, process <b>400</b> provides methods for saving such data, and associating it with new data records so that it stored in form accessible by users who continue to use the system <b>100</b> and/or the otherwise deleted data after it has been deleted by a particular user. Data preserved according to process <b>400</b> may for example, include an entire contact data set, or a group of entire data sets, or portions of one or more such contact data sets. For example, in various embodiments process <b>400</b> provides for deletion of information related to an individual contact (e.g., a particular officer or employee of an institution such as bank or other lender) while preserving documents and other information associated with the contact, his/her institution, and/or a particular transaction or set of transactions.</p>
    <p num="p-0154">At <b>402</b> a user who has stored contact data gains access to the system, for example by using suitably-adapted secure log-on processes. At <b>404</b> the user selects to be deleted. Data selected at <b>404</b> may be contact information, deal information, summary information, or any combinations thereof, and may be stored in any of dataset(s) <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0155">At <b>406</b> deletion of the data is initiated. This may be accomplished, for example, by a user selecting or implementing a suitably-configured command on a computer, for example as in computing device <b>22</b> of system <b>100</b>. This may further involve the user interacting with hypertext links and/or graphical interface items such as tabs, lists and other user interface components to navigate to, and select, the data that is to be deleted. In some preferred implementations of the invention, deletion of some data sets, such as for example deletion of contact information, can only be done by a bookrunner or other specifically authorized user, for example where the information relates to a private contact and is accessible solely by, or with the authorization of, that bookrunner. In other cases, bookrunners or other users can only request but cannot complete processing for deletions. In such embodiments a tool such as an Administrator delete function can be provided, through the use of which notification of processed deletions (e.g. the contact deleted and chosen replacement contact) can be provided to the requesting (deleting) bookrunner and to any other bookrunners that had invited that deleted contact to participate in a current deal.</p>
    <p num="p-0156">At <b>408</b> the user is offered an option of preserving any of the data included in the data set designated for deletion. Such an option may be initiated at the request of the deleting user, or may be presented automatically by suitably-configured program structures executed by processor <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0157">An example of a user interface screen useful for enabling a bookrunner, administrator, or other user to make such determinations is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. In the example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a display associated with a user system from which a request to delete data associated with a contact ‘Caroline Daser’ is caused to display a warning that the contact associated with the designated data may be associated with established relationships to other deals and/or bookrunners. For example, the system <b>22</b>, <b>120</b> to which such a deletion request has been made can search the identified data set, and all related databases or other data sets, to identify such other deals and/or bookrunners, and cause the display to display (a) at <b>1602</b>, a listing of types of relationships, deals, and/or related data associated with the contact identified for deletion, and (b) at <b>1604</b> a listing of contacts identified by the system <b>22</b>, <b>120</b> as having established relationships with the contact.</p>
    <p num="p-0158">As a further example, when a user attempts to delete contact information there may some contact information (such as deal comments, investor notes, fax numbers or other information for parties invited to the same deal) that is to be saved. In such a case the user may be presented with a list of possible contacts from the same bank/institution that are related to the contact to be deleted. The relation may be that the two contacts are the same (i.e., duplicate records, or work in the same city/department/branch, etc., as the deleted contact, share a common e-mail address, or other relationships. The user, being presented with such substitute contacts, may be enabled to select which contact the information should be transferred to.</p>
    <p num="p-0159">If at <b>408</b> there is no such associated data to be reviewed, or an instruction is received by a authorized reviewing user confirming that the data should be deleted, at <b>410</b> the data selected at <b>404</b> is deleted. If, at <b>408</b>, there is data that should be kept then process <b>400</b> continues at <b>412</b> where the appropriate location to save the data is determined.</p>
    <p num="p-0160">The determination at <b>412</b>, similar to the decision at <b>408</b>, may be made or suggested by a user or may be made or suggested by system <b>100</b>. Such a determination may be based on, for example, the similarity between contacts such as their employer or their deal information, or may be based on which database or databases the information that is to be deleted is stored in. After the determination is made at <b>412</b>, process <b>400</b> continues to <b>414</b> where the data is saved in its new location and the data that was selected at <b>404</b> and is not to be kept is deleted.</p>
    <p num="p-0161">Thus the invention provides systems, process, and computer-executable media adapted for causing a computer to provide for a display device associated with a user input system signals usable by the display device for displaying a user interface comprising data useful by a user for communicating with at least one of a bookrunner, an arranger, an underwriter, a borrower, a participant, an invitee, and a loan service provider; and upon receiving from the user input system signals representing a command to delete from memory accessible by the user at least a portion of the data useful for communicating, associating the data useful for communicating with at least one different bookrunner, arranger, underwriter, borrower, participant, invitee, or loan service provider (e.g. another user).</p>
    <p num="p-0162">Such systems, processes, and computer-executable media can base such associating of data useful for communicating with at least one different bookrunner, arranger, underwriter, borrower, participant, invitee, or loan service provider on a variety of factors, including for example at least partly on a comparison of the data useful by a user for communicating with the at least one bookrunner, arranger, underwriter, borrower, participant, invitee, or loan service provider and data useful for communicating with the at least one different bookrunner, arranger, underwriter, borrower, participant, invitee, or loan service provider.</p>
    <p num="p-0163">Data preserved in such fashion can include, for example, declines, commitments to deals, contact data, and deal comments.</p>
    <p num="p-0164">Another particularly useful feature offered by the invention is the automatic notification of users of changes in data and other information related to transactions. Such notifications may be provided to users who have expressly requested notification, or for whom messages are intended to be sent upon designation by an arranger or administrator, and they may relate to any type of occurrences with respect to changing of information related to a deal or deals that the users are associated with. For example, a user may want request notification upon storage or modification of data relating to or representing deal-related documents being added, contact information being changed, or new participants or invitees added to a transaction list. System <b>100</b> and/or any authorized bookrunner or other arranger or administrator may also determine that particular users should be sent certain messages.</p>
    <p num="p-0165"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> presents a schematic flow diagram of an example of such a process. Process <b>450</b> begins at <b>452</b> with a determination of whether information of any suitably designated type has changed. Information that has changed may relate to deal information, to a particular data set (e.g. any or all of data sets <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>), or to the information that one bookrunner controls, or any other desired matter.</p>
    <p num="p-0166">The determination at <b>452</b> may be triggered by any desired event, including for example a timed or periodic review, or a change in data structures or individual data items or records comprising suitable flags.</p>
    <p num="p-0167">If designated data has changed, at <b>456</b> synchronization and/or notification can be triggered.</p>
    <p num="p-0168">Exemplary changes of information that could be used as triggers for synchronization and/or automated notification include a bookrunner obtaining a commitment from an invitee/participant, a contact adding a comment that relates to a tranche or other aspect of the deal they are not a participant in, or addition of a new document to one bookrunner database or dataset that may need to be copied into another dataset or database relating to another bookrunner, or copied into a public dataset of the bookrunner so other users may view it. Such changes are exemplary only, the datasets or databases may be synchronized in response to other changes.</p>
    <p num="p-0169">If, for example, when a bank commits to deal, the bookrunner who obtained the commitment will record the committed amount and related information in the Bookrunning page. At <b>456</b>, the system may determine that details have changed, meaning that other related details have also changed. The system may then synchronize the overall deal financial details by adding the total commitment obtained by each bookrunner to arrive at a new total amount of the deal that has been sold.</p>
    <p num="p-0170">By way of a further example, a bookrunner may post a comment to their database relating to the status of their portion of the deal, as it relates to the deal as a whole. Such a comment may be deemed to be a ‘deal-level comment’. In such a case, the system may synchronize comments between bookrunners' databases or datasets—replicating the comment in each bookrunner's database or dataset.</p>
    <p num="p-0171">Performing a synchronization at <b>456</b> may involve a user causing the change to input instructions indicating whether to synchronize and/or what synchronization actions to take. In other embodiments, the system may make such determinations without a user's input.</p>
    <p num="p-0172">After or at the same time as the possible synchronization, <b>456</b> there is a determination of whether the change relates to one or more notification data items. The one or more notification data items set out the changes of information that will trigger a notification for one or more users, who may have been pre-identified by, for example, association with designated groups of users such as all users designated by or associated with a bookrunner, lender, or service provider. By way of example, a change in the name of a contact that already exists may not trigger a notification, as the name change may simply correct a spelling mistake. If the change does not relate to one or more notification data items, then process <b>450</b> ends at <b>454</b>. If the change does relate to one or more notification data items, then the process <b>450</b> continues to <b>458</b> to determine users who are to receive a notification. The determination at <b>458</b> may involve, for example, going through each user and checking whether they have the corresponding notification data item that indicates that they want to be notified when that particular change occurs.</p>
    <p num="p-0173">It will be noted that users may be enabled to designate, at the times of changes or deletions, a user or users that should receive notification. This may for example occur if a change in information results in a synchronization to another bookrunner's database such as adding a new comment. A user of another bookrunner's database or dataset may have the notification data item to provide them notification upon addition of a comment to their bookrunner's database. Were it not for the synchronization, the system may not recognize, at <b>458</b>, that they should receive a notification.</p>
    <p num="p-0174">In other embodiments, notification data items may allow specification that if changes to another bookrunner's database or dataset apply outside of that bookrunner's database, then the user wants to receive notification.</p>
    <p num="p-0175">Process <b>400</b> can continue at <b>460</b>, where for each user that is to receive a notification, a format to be used in sending the notification is determined. Exemplary formats for sending the notification data include email, fax, SMS, text messaging, letter, automated telephone call, or other forms. Process <b>450</b> then proceeds to <b>462</b> where the notifications are sent to each intended user.</p>
    <p num="p-0176">An example of a notification <b>1401</b> in the form of an e-mail provided to a user “Beatriz Lacaz” of the new availability of a group of documents <b>1402</b> is provided in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>. A hypertext link <b>1403</b> and contact information <b>1404</b> are provided as aids to gathering additional information, if desired.</p>
    <p num="p-0177">Further examples of synchronization and automated, intelligent correction of data are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14C and 14D</figref>. The features shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14C and 14D</figref> are provide particularly helpful aids to the avoidance of errors in data entry.</p>
    <p num="p-0178">In the example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>, a user has entered at <b>4001</b> an e-mail address and at <b>4002</b> last and first names of an individual associated with that address. Upon subsequent entry of “Next” execution command <b>4003</b>, processor <b>12</b> has executed comparison logic which has compared the first and last names of input fields <b>4002</b> to portions <b>4004</b> and <b>4005</b> of the address in field <b>4001</b>, based on commonly-used business e-mail formats, which have been previously analyzed and suitably programmed. As a result of the comparison, processor <b>12</b> has made a determination that the spelling of last name “Rabbit” at <b>4002</b> may not agree with portion <b>4005</b> “Ravbit” entered at <b>4001</b>, and has issued a suitable error warning message <b>4006</b>. The user is accordingly provided an opportunity of correcting the data entered and re-executing command <b>3603</b> for reading and potential storage of data entered. Upon re-entry of identical data, processor <b>12</b> can execute logic to accept the data as correct, and store it in spite of the apparent discrepancy.</p>
    <p num="p-0179">In the example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</figref>, processor <b>12</b> has executed logic to parse data entered at <b>3701</b> and compare individual parsed fields with corresponding fields of other data records sharing common field data. Based on the format of other, previously-stored records sharing data in fields <b>3703</b>, the processor has executed logic to suggest a change in format to field delimiter <b>3704</b> to conform to formatting in such previously stored data, and has caused a warning <b>3705</b> to be displayed. In the example shown, the user is provided options <b>3706</b> for changing to the suggested format and <b>3707</b> to confirm the data as entered, and to cause that data to be stored for future use.</p>
    <p num="p-0180">Thus the invention provides systems, processes, and computer-executable media for causing a computer, upon receipt of signals adapted for causing the computer to change at least one instance of a redundantly-stored data item associated with the syndicated loan offering, to change at least one other instance of the redundantly-stored data item. Changing an instance of a redundantly-stored data item can include, for example, over-writing, replacing, and deleting the item, or any portion thereof.</p>
    <p num="p-0181">The changing the at least one other instance of the redundantly-stored data item can be performed subject to confirmation by a user, so that the change is contingent upon receipt of a confirmation command signal from the same or another user input system.</p>
    <p num="p-0182">The invention further provides such systems, processes, and media wherein, upon changing the at least one other instance of the redundantly-stored data item, the processor (e.g., processor <b>12</b>) is caused to provide output signals representing notification of the changing of the at least one other instance of the redundantly-stored data item. Such notification signals can be formatted for communications processing according to an electronic communication protocol, such as one or more of electronic mail, Signal Message Service, and telephone facsimile protocols.</p>
    <p num="p-0183"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> is a schematic flow diagram of an embodiment of a process for creating invitee lists in accordance the invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0184">In many presently-preferred embodiments, each bookrunner is enabled to add any invited individual or institution, and such institutions by default become mapped to the bookrunner that added it. Refinements to the invitee split can be accomplished in the Allocate Bookrunners page.</p>
    <p num="p-0185">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, process <b>550</b> allocates invitees for a deal and creates invitee lists for a deal, beginning at <b>552</b> where an invitee list for the deal is created. Creating an invitee list for each bookrunner associated with the deal may involve importing data associated with invitees from other deals where they were a bookrunner, manually entering invitees, or by selecting from the bookrunner's respective private contact database or the public contact database, or by importing a list prepared by an external application such as a spreadsheet. Once an invitee list has been created at <b>552</b>, process <b>550</b> may continue to <b>554</b> where a invitee list for each bookrunner is created. The invitee list for each bookrunner created at <b>554</b> may for example substantially be an empty invitee list that will be filled from the deal invitee list, or may be an invitee list that has already been partially populated by invitees that the bookrunner is already aware of.</p>
    <p num="p-0186">After creation of an invitee list at <b>554</b>, process <b>550</b> continues at <b>556</b> where each invitee from the deal invitee list can be assigned to a responsible bookrunner, if a default assignment has not already been made automatically. At <b>556</b>, process <b>550</b> ensures that invitees are not missed, and are assigned to a bookrunner invitee list. It may be desirable, according to process <b>550</b>, for an invitee to only be assigned to one bookrunner invitee list so that an invitee does not have multiple bookrunners contacting them for involvement in the deal. However, it is not outside of the scope of the present invention for an invitee to be on one or more bookrunner invitee list as well as being on the deal invitee list. This may occur if, for example, at <b>554</b> a bookrunner has an invitee list, that they have imported from another deal, in a private database, and then the invitee is assigned to a different bookrunner invitee list at <b>556</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0187">The invention further provides improvements in the entry of data, and particularly in improved efficiency in completing the entry of related data items, such as telephone numbers and geographic locations. For example, the invention provides for the suggestion of data items to be associated with multi-item data records, based on relationships between items.</p>
    <p num="p-0188"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> is a user interface for adding a contact to a database in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.

To non-administrators, in such embodiments, only the information displayed under the heading “Contact Info” is made available; the “Admin Details” section is not.</p>
    <p num="p-0189">In the example shown, a bookrunner or other user has invoked a command for the display of an interface screen comprising a variety of data input items corresponding to relevant classes of information, including drop-down menus <b>671</b>, type-in input fields or boxes <b>672</b>, “radio button” option menus <b>673</b>, and option/selection boxes <b>674</b>. Based on data input using various of the input items, processor <b>12</b> can search records stored in data structure(s) <b>14</b> for related, previously-entered data, and provide over-rideable default entry of all or portions of such related, previously-entered data as input for the new data record. For example, having previously identified the new contact <b>3801</b> “Inna Gogoua” as affiliated with National City Bank (United States), default information relating to branches, and associated city names <b>3802</b>, addresses, and telephone area- or city-codes <b>3803</b> can be provided as default entries. Additionally, proposed e-mail addresses <b>3804</b> can be constructed from previously-entered related e-mail addresses (e.g., addresses for co-workers for a newly-entered contact) and known e-mail formats used by the institution with which the contact is affiliated. Incorrect information provided as defaults can be overridden in any suitable manner, as for example by typing in text boxes <b>672</b>, selection of other options from pull-down menus <b>671</b> or radio-buttons <b>673</b>, or browsing using items <b>681</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0190">An example of a process for adding a contact affiliated with an institution such as a bank is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15C-15E</figref>. Using the interface shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</figref>, a user has accessed an interface adapted for adding any contact, whether or not affiliated with any bank or other institution. In an initial step, the user has entered e-mail address “jack.byne@Aarealbank.com” in text-entry box <b>672</b>. Selection of execution command item “Continue” <b>3901</b> can result in reading and parsing of the data entered in box <b>672</b> by processor <b>12</b>, and comparison of some or all of the resultant parsed data items with data records and known data formats previously stored in data structure(s) <b>14</b>. Based on such a comparison, processor <b>12</b> can identify one or more likely default values for contact name, etc., and possible matches for likely institutional affiliations of the contact.</p>
    <p num="p-0191">For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15D</figref>, processor <b>12</b> has suggested, based on such a comparison, that the contact's name is likely “Jack Byne”, and at <b>672</b>, <b>3902</b> has presented a corresponding over-rideable default contact name. At <b>3903</b>, the processor has suggested a probable institutional affiliation “Aareal Bank”, together with radio button options for selecting “Aareal Bank” as a correct affiliation or requesting, via “Select Other” button presentation of a further interactive screen for entry of a different institution name, and optionally further related data.</p>
    <p num="p-0192">When the user has indicated by selection of the corresponding radio button that “Aareal Bank” is the correct institutional affiliation, processor <b>12</b> can cause a display such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15E</figref> to be presented. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15E</figref> provides radio button options for cities corresponding to major known offices of the selected institution, together with both a pull down menu <b>671</b> of relatively less frequently designated branches, and box <b>672</b> for manual entry of cities corresponding to offices not listed in items <b>673</b> or <b>671</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0193">An innovation in the management of contacts is the basis of location by City rather than the commonly used Country fields of other contact management systems. In some presently-preferred embodiments, systems according to the invention neither have nor need Country fields. The intelligent construction of lists provided in pull-down menus <b>671</b>, radio-button option fields <b>673</b>, etc., is another advantageous feature provided by the invention. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15E</figref>, for example, differing levels of default or suggested input options can be provided, based on reviews of data stored in structure(s) <b>14</b>, on the frequency with which responses are provided by system users, or from pre-programmed decision trees.</p>
    <p num="p-0194">A further example, relating to the addition of a new bank as an institutional contact, is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15F</figref>. Among data items to be associated with the corresponding contact data record are cities menu <b>673</b>, <b>802</b>, “Other City” pull-down menu <b>671</b>, <b>804</b>, and text-entry box <b>672</b>, <b>806</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0195">Radio-button input field <b>673</b>, <b>802</b> can, as previously described, be assembled by processor <b>12</b>, working from data structure(s) <b>14</b>, using data corresponding to the largest, most prominent, or most-frequently chosen offices associated with the new bank “ABC Bank”. For less well-known or less frequently-chosen offices, pull down menu <b>671</b> can be provided (among other advantages, the use of pull-down menus <b>671</b> in addition to radio-button fields <b>673</b> can save important screen space on interface displays). And the provision of text input fields <b>672</b> can provide options for new offices, or offices previously unknown to the system <b>100</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0196">Other useful sources for options included in fields and menus <b>673</b>, <b>671</b> are the locations of other important parties in a transaction, such as borrowers, arrangers, or other key lenders.</p>
    <p num="p-0197">City list <b>810</b> may be provided at the same time as city selector <b>802</b>, to provide for rapid and efficient entry of cities and/or offices not previously associated with the contact, but prominent in the field or industry in which the transaction is to take place, so as to save time and effort.</p>
    <p num="p-0198">When for example a user selects or specifies a city, the system may store the city that is being selected and automatically associate that city with a country and various other details about the city. The country and the various details about the city may be acquired from city list <b>810</b>, which may be presented to the user or may simply be stored and accessible by the system when next button <b>808</b> is selected.</p>
    <p num="p-0199">As will be understood by those skilled in the relevant arts, various fields or functions provided through the use of the interface shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15F</figref>, and in other interfaces described herein, can be limited to various users or classes of users. For example, portions of the interface shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15F</figref> adapted for creation of a new contact can be limited to bookrunners, arrangers, or other administrative users. Other functions, including for example field <b>810</b>, which can be used for management of a global city or contact list, can be accessed by all bookrunners or other users authorized to contribute to the maintenance of the list.</p>
    <p num="p-0200">While the invention has been described in some detail for purposes of clarity and understanding, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the relevant arts, once they have been made familiar with this disclosure, that various changes in form and detail can be made without departing from the true scope of the invention set out in the claims. The scope of the invention is therefore not to be limited to the exact components or details of methodology or construction set forth above.</p>
    <p num="p-0201">Except to the extent necessary or inherent in the processes themselves, no particular order to steps or stages of methods or processes described in this disclosure, including the Figures, is intended or implied. In many cases the order of process steps may be varied without changing the purpose, effect, or import of the methods described.</p>
    <p num="p-0202">It is to be understood that the invention is, in relevant part, described herein only in terms of strict financial or other possibility. Actual implementation of the invention may be subject to regulatory or other legal requirement(s), and no representation is made hereby that any particular embodiment complies with any regulatory or other requirement(s).</p>
