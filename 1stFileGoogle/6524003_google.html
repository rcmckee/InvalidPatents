comprises a guide rail provided with a ball running groove, and a movable block movably arranged along the guide rail through balls. The movable block is provided with a ball running counter-groove, a ball returning passage arranged away from the ball running counter-groove and direction changing passages for connecting these members. A resin-formed body for forming a ball circulation passage comprises a pair of ball passage forming portions, a returning passage forming portion and a pair of direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions. The resin-formed body is separately formed from a body of the movable block. At least two portions of (a) the ball passage forming portions, (b) the returning passage forming portion, (c) one of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions and (d) another of the of direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions are connected with each other through integral forming so that the resin-formed body can be built in the body of the movable block.</div>

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>The present invention relates to a linear motion guiding apparatus in which a passage forming member formed of resin is built into a body of movable member.</p>
    <p>2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p>The applicant has already proposed a technical idea that, in a movable block of a linear motion guiding apparatus, a pair of ball passage forming portions extending along the opposite longitudinal sides of a loaded-ball running groove, a ball returning passage forming portion and a pair of direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions were integrally formed of resin with a body of the movable block (refer to Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. H7-317,762).</p>
    <p>More specifically, when a resin forming is carried out, the body of the movable block is inserted in a die, and the ball passage forming portions, the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions or the ball returning passage forming portion is integrally formed with the block body.</p>
    <p>In the conventional movable block obtained by the integral forming, the block body is inserted in the die, as mentioned above. When the block body has a large size, a large-scaled die is required to be used. It is not easy to prepare such a large-scaled die, and there is actual restriction in size. The ball passage forming portions located at the opposite longitudinal sides of the ball running groove extending along the longitudinal direction of the block body are thin and long, with the result that molten resin may not reach every part of the space for forming the ball passage forming portions during the resin forming treatment.</p>
    <p>Increase in number of gates formed on the die may solve the above-mentioned problem of misrun of the molten resin. However, when the block body is inserted in the die, the block body may deteriorate the run of the molten resin.</p>
    <p>When the movable block has a pair of wing portions, which face right and left-hand side portions of the guide rail so that the guide rail is held between the wing portions, and there are four trains of balls between the right and left-hand side portions of the guide rail and the right and left-hand wing portions of the moving block, and more specifically, the upper and lower trains of balls are arranged at each of a gap between the right-hand side portion of the guide rail and the corresponding right-hand wing portion of the moving block and another gap between the left-hand side portion of the guide rail and the corresponding left-hand wing portion of the moving block, the block body inserted in the die may deteriorate the run of the molten resin in the width direction of the moving block.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>An object of the present invention is therefore to provide a linear motion guiding apparatus in which a resin-formed body for forming a rolling member circulation passage is formed separately from a body of a movable member so as to permit easy formation of the resin-formed body, and such a resin-formed body is able to be built in the body of the movable member, ensuring integral formability of the maximum number of unit parts for defining the rolling member circulation passage.</p>
    <p>In order to attain the aforementioned object, a linear motion guiding apparatus comprises:</p>
    <p>a guide member provided with a rolling member running track, and</p>
    <p>a movable member arranged so as to be movable along the guide member through a large number of rolling members, said movable member being provided with (i) a rolling member running counter-track corresponding to the rolling member running track of said guide member, (ii) a rolling member returning passage arranged away from said rolling member running counter-track by a prescribed distance and in parallel therewith and (iii) a pair of direction changing passages for connecting the rolling member running counter-track and the rolling member returning passage to permit circulation of the rolling members,</p>
    <p>characterized in that:</p>
    <p>a resin-formed body for forming a rolling member circulation passage comprises a pair of rolling member passage forming portions extending along both longitudinal sides of said rolling member running counter-track, a returning passage forming portion for forming the rolling member returning passage and a pair of direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions for forming inner peripheral guide portions of said direction changing passages, said resin-formed body being separately formed from a body of said movable member; and</p>
    <p>at least two portions of (a) said pair of rolling member passage forming portions, (b) said returning passage forming portion, (c) one of said pair of direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions and (d) another of said pair of direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions are connected with each other through integral forming so that said resin-formed body can be built in the body of said movable member.</p>
    <p>Embodiments of the combination of these portions (a) to (d) for the resin-formed body for forming the rolling member circulation passage may include the following three examples:</p>
    <p>the first example in which the resin-formed body comprises (i) an integral body of the pair of rolling member passage forming portions and the pair of direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions, and (ii) the returning passage forming portion separately formed from the integral body</p>
    <p>the second example in which the resin-formed body comprises (i) an integral body of the pair of rolling member passage forming portions, the returning passage forming portion and one of the pair of direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions, and (ii) another of the pair of direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions separately formed from the integral body; and</p>
    <p>the third example in which the resin-formed body is manufactured by preparing an integral body of the pair of rolling member passage forming portions, the returning passage forming portion and the pair of direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions, and then dividing the pair of rolling member passage forming portions and the returning passage forming portion in longitudinal intermediate portions thereof into respective two parts.</p>
    <p>According to the present invention, the resin-formed body for forming the rolling member circulation passage is separately formed from the body of the movable member. Even if the movable member has a large size, the flow of molten resin is not therefore restricted by the body of the movable member unlike the conventional prior art in which the body of the movable member and the resin-formed body are integrally formed with each other, and it is possible to ensure proper run of molten resin through increase in a number of gates in the die, thus leading to an excellent formability. In general, it is hard to achieve proper run of molten resin especially at the rolling member passage forming portions extending along the longitudinal sides of the rolling member running counter-track, and it is therefore effective to separately form the resin-formed body from the body of the movable member in the same manner as the present invention.</p>
    <p>The rolling member circulation passage is formed by the resin-formed body. Therefore, the direct positioning can be achieved in the relative positional relationship between the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions and the rolling member passage forming portion, as well as the relative positional relationship between the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions and the returning passage forming portion, and the continuity of the rolling member circulation passage is properly ensured, thus leading to smooth run of the rolling members.</p>
    <p>Since the rolling member passage forming portions are located along the both longitudinal sides of the rolling member running counter-track, the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions having a proper relative positional relationship with the rolling member passage forming portions are accurately set on the both ends of the rolling member running counter-track.</p>
    <p>Maintenance of a proper relative positional relationship of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions with the rolling member returning passage causes the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions to be accurately connected to the inner surface of the rolling member returning passage.</p>
    <p>Especially, change in a running direction of the rolling members takes place in the connection area of the rolling member passage forming portions with the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions as well as in the connection area of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions with returning passage forming portion. When two portions in such a connection area are connected with each other by integral forming, a step for assembling these two portions is not required, thus making it possible to ensure a smooth continuity of these two portions without being affected by accuracy of assembly.</p>
    <p>The rolling member returning passage may be a through-hole formed in the body of the movable member, the resin formed-body may comprise the pair of direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions and the rolling member passage forming portions extending along the both longitudinal sides of the rolling member running counter-track, and the rolling member passage forming portions and at least one of the pair of direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions may be connected with each other through integral forming.</p>
    <p>When the rolling member passage forming portions and the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions are integrally formed with each other so as to provide the smooth connection area in this manner, it is possible to achieve the smooth run of the rolling members in the connection area of these portions, thus improving circulation property of the rolling member without providing any returning passage forming portion made of resin. Such a construction causes easy manufacture of the apparatus due to no existence of the returning passage forming portion.</p>
    <p>The present invention may have additional features that a rolling member retainer is provided, the rolling member retainer being able to retain the rolling members in a train with a prescribed distance kept between adjacent two of the rolling members, and the rolling member retainer having side edge portions projecting from both sides of each of the rolling members; and guide grooves for guiding the side edge portions of the rolling member retainer are formed on an entire periphery of the rolling member circulation passage.</p>
    <p>The present invention may have additional features that a retaining portion is provided on the rolling member passage forming portion, for preventing the rolling member retainer being out of place, when the movable member is removed from the guide member, and a guide portion is continuously formed on the entire periphery of the rolling member circulation passage, for guiding the side edge portions of the rolling member retainer.</p>
    <p>Such provision of the rolling member retainer permits the smooth run of the rolling members by means of the rolling member retainer, due to proper maintenance of continuity of the guide portion for the rolling member retainer.</p>
    <p>Since the guide portion for the rolling member retainer having a small thickness is not formed by inserting the body of the movable member in a die and then injecting molten resin into the die, but is separately formed from the body of the movable member, position of gates can freely be determined without being restricted by the body of the movable member, with the result that molten resin can reach, during formation of the guide portion, the entire space therefor, which is formed in the die.</p>
    <p>The present invention may have additional features that each of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions has a thin sheet portion, which is to be brought into contact with the end face of the body of the movable member, and each of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions is connected to the rolling member passage forming portions or the returning passage forming portion by means of the thin sheet portion.</p>
    <p>When each of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions is connected to the rolling member passage forming portions by means of the thin sheet portion, deformation of the thin sheet portion can absorb distortion, which occurs between the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion and the rolling member passage forming portion, or between the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion and the returning passage forming portion. Accordingly, it is possible to maintain an accurate positional relationship between the end of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion and the rolling member passage forming portion or between the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion and the returning passage forming portion.</p>
    <p>The thin sheet portion is urged against the flat end face of the body of the movable member by a clamping force, which is applied to the side cover plate. The position of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion can therefore be corrected through deformation of the thin sheet portion, even when the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion is not correctly positioned relative to the end face of the body of the movable member. In addition, the thin sheet portion can firmly be secured between the side cover plate and the body of the movable member by the clamping force, which is applied to the side cover plate, thus preventing the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion from being incorrectly placed.</p>
    <p>The apparatus of the present invention may have the construction that the guide member comprises a guide rail; the movable member comprises a movable block, which is provided with a horizontal portion, which faces an upper surface of the guide rail and a pair of wing portions, between which the guide rail is held at right and left-hand side surfaces thereof, two trains of the rolling members are arranged in a gap between the upper surface of the guide rail and a lower surface of the movable block, and a single train of the rolling members is arranged in each of gaps between the right and left-hand side surfaces of the guide rail and:both of the wing portions, so as to provide a total number of trains of four.</p>
    <p>The apparatus of the present invention may have the construction that the guide member comprises a guide rail; the movable member comprises a movable block, which is provided with a pair of wing portions, between which the guide rail is held at right and left-hand side surfaces thereof, and two trains of the rolling members are arranged in each of gaps between the right and left-hand side surfaces of the guide rail and both of the wing portions, so as to provide a total number of trains of four.</p>
    <p>In these cases, the respective four direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions may be formed into an integral body, or the respective two direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions at each of the right and left-hand sides of the movable block may be formed into an integral body.</p>
    <p>The apparatus of the present invention may have the construction that the guide member comprises a guide rail; the movable member is provided with a horizontal portion, which faces an upper surface of the guide rail and a single wing portion, which faces one side surface of the guide rail; a single train of the rolling members is arranged in a gap between the one side surface of the guide rail and the single wing portion, and another single train of the rolling members is arranged in a gap between the upper surface of the guide rail and a lower surface of the horizontal portion in a vicinity of a corner of the guide rail.</p>
    <p>The apparatus of the present invention may have the construction that the guide member comprises a guide rail; the movable member comprises a movable block, which is provided with a pair of wing portions, between which the guide rail is held at right and left-hand side surfaces thereof, and a single train of the rolling members is arranged in each of gaps between the right and left-hand side surfaces of the guide rail and both of the wing portions, so as to provide a total number of trains of two.</p>
    <p>The apparatus of the present invention may have the construction that the guide member comprises a guide rail; the movable member comprises a movable block arranged along one side surface of the guide rail; and two trains of the rolling members are arranged in a gap between the one side surface of the guide rail and the movable block.</p>
    <p>The apparatus of the present invention may have the construction that the guide member comprises a spline shaft; and the movable member comprises an outer tube, which is movably supported on the spline shaft through a plurality of trains of the rolling members.</p>
    <p>In addition, according to the present invention, there is also provided a linear motion guiding apparatus comprising:</p>
    <p>a guide rail provided with two rolling member running tracks on each of right and left-hand side surfaces of the guide rail, so as to provide a total number of the rolling member running tracks of four; and</p>
    <p>a movable block provided with a pair of wing portions, between which the guide rail is held at the right and left-hand side surfaces thereof, each of said wing portions having on an inner surface thereof two rolling member running counter-tracks corresponding to said two rolling member running tracks of the guide rail, so as to provide a total number of the rolling member running counter-tracks of four, said movable block having four endless circulation passages, which are formed by four rolling member returning passages arranged in parallel with said four rolling member running counter-tracks, respectively, and rolling member returning passages for connecting both ends of each of said four rolling member running counter-tracks with both ends of each of said four:rolling member returning passages, respectively</p>
    <p>characterized in that:</p>
    <p>a resin-formed body comprises, for each of said endless circulation passages, a pair of rolling member passage forming portions extending along both longitudinal sides of said rolling member running counter-track, a returning passage forming portion for forming the rolling member returning passage and a pair of direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions for forming inner peripheral guide portions of said direction changing passages, said resin-formed body being separately formed from a body of said movable block;</p>
    <p>said resin-formed body is divided into two body-parts, which are arranged on the wing portions of the movable block, respectively, so as to form the two endless circulation passages at an inner side of each of the wing portions; and</p>
    <p>in each of the two body-parts, the rolling member running counter-track and the pair of direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions are formed into an integral body, and the returning passage forming portion is separately formed from said integral body.</p>
    <p>According to the present invention, the resin-formed body for forming the rolling member circulation passage is separately formed from the body of the movable block. Even if the movable block has a large size, the flow of molten resin is not therefore restricted by the body of the movable block unlike the conventional prior art in which the body of the movable block and the resin-formed body are integrally formed with each other, and it is possible to ensure proper run of molten resin through increase in a number of gates in the die, thus leading to an excellent formability.

    <p>Especially, since the resin-formed body is divided into the two body-parts, each of which forms two endless circulation passages, a proper run of molten resin can be ensured, even when the block of the movable block has a larger width.</p>
    <p>The rolling member circulation passage is formed by the resin-formed body. Therefore, the direct positioning can be achieved in the relative positional relationship between the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions and the rolling member passage forming portion, as well as the relative positional relationship between the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions and the returning passage forming portion, and the continuity of the rolling member circulation passage is properly ensured, thus leading to smooth run of the rolling members.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p>Now, embodiments of a linear motion guiding apparatus the present invention will be described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <heading>FIRST EMBODIMENT</heading> <p>FIGS. 1 to <b>7</b> show a linear motion guiding apparatus of the first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p>The linear motion guiding apparatus <b>1</b> is provided with a guide rail <b>2</b> as a guide member, which extends linearly, and a movable block <b>4</b> as a movable member, which is arranged so as to be movable along the guide rail <b>2</b> through a large number of balls <b>3</b> as rolling members.</p>
    <p>The guide rail <b>2</b> is formed into a long bar shape having a rectangular cross-section. Two ball running grooves <b>5</b>, <b>5</b> as a rolling member running track are formed on the horizontal upper surface of the guide rail <b>2</b>, and a single ball running groove <b>5</b> as the rolling member running track is formed on each of the right and left-hand vertical surfaces of the guide rail <b>2</b>, so as to provide a total number of grooves <b>5</b> of four.</p>
    <p>The movable block <b>4</b> is formed as a block body having an inverse U-shaped cross-section, with its opening end being directed downwardly. The block body is provided with a horizontal portion <b>6</b>, which faces the upper surface of the guide rail <b>2</b> and with a pair of wing portions <b>7</b>, <b>7</b>, which extend downwardly from the right and left ends of the horizontal portion <b>6</b> and face the right and left-hand side surfaces of the guide rail <b>2</b>, respectively. The horizontal portion <b>6</b> has on its lower surface two ball running counter-grooves <b>8</b>, <b>8</b> as a rolling member running counter-track, which correspond to the ball running grooves <b>5</b>, <b>5</b> formed on the upper surface of the guide rail <b>2</b>. Each of the wing portions <b>7</b>, <b>7</b> has on its inner surface a single ball running counter-groove <b>8</b> as the rolling member running counter-track, which corresponds to the respective ball running grooves <b>5</b>, <b>5</b> formed on the right and left-hand side surfaces of the guide rail <b>2</b>.</p>
    <p>In addition, in the movable block <b>4</b>, there are formed four ball returning passages <b>9</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>9</b> as a rolling member returning passage, which are provided in parallel with the four ball running counter-grooves <b>8</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>8</b>, respectively, as well as four pairs of direction changing passages <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>10</b> each having a U-shape, for connecting the respective both ends of the ball running counter-grooves <b>8</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>8</b> with the respective both ends of the ball returning passages <b>9</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>9</b>, so as to form four endless circulation passages. The ball returning passages <b>9</b>, <b>9</b> respectively corresponding to the ball running grooves <b>5</b>, <b>5</b> formed on the upper side of the guide rail <b>2</b> are formed in the horizontal portion <b>6</b>. The other ball returning passages <b>9</b>, <b>9</b> respectively corresponding to the ball running grooves <b>5</b>, <b>5</b> formed on the right and left-hand vertical surfaces of the guide rail <b>2</b> are formed in the wing portions <b>7</b>, <b>7</b> of the movable block <b>4</b>, respectively.</p>
    <p>In each of the four endless circulation passages in this embodiment, the balls <b>3</b> are retained in the form of train by means a ball retainer <b>12</b> as a rolling member retainer, as shown in FIG. 4 so that the balls <b>3</b> can be circulated while being guided by the ball retainer <b>12</b>. <b>12</b> <i>b </i>has a width longer than the diameter of the ball <b>3</b> so that the both side edges of the belt portion <b>12</b> <i>b </i>extend outwardly from the ball <b>3</b>.</p>
    <p>The spacing portion <b>12</b> <i>c </i>is provided with a ball supporting spherical recess <b>12</b> <i>d </i>corresponding to the spherical surface of the ball <b>3</b>. The ball <b>3</b> is supported on its both sides by a pair of supporting spherical recesses <b>12</b> <i>d </i>so as to prevent the ball <b>3</b> from coming off the belt portion <b>12</b> <i>b</i>. In this embodiment, the one end of the belt portion <b>12</b> <i>b </i>is not connected to the other end thereof, thus forming a strip-shaped belt having the both ends. The one end of the belt portion <b>12</b> <i>b </i>may be connected to the other end thereof so as to form an endless belt.</p>
    <p>The movable block <b>4</b> is composed of a block body <b>13</b> having ball running counter-grooves <b>8</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>8</b>, a resin-formed body <b>20</b> for forming ball circulation passages, which is inserted in the block body <b>13</b>, and a pair of side cover plates <b>40</b>, <b>40</b> secured to the both end surfaces of the block body <b>13</b>, in which the resin-formed body <b>20</b> is inserted.</p>
    <p>Each of the ball circulation passages of the resin-formed body <b>20</b> comprises a pair of ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> extending along both longitudinal sides of the ball running counter-groove <b>8</b>, a pair of direction changing passage inner guide forming portions <b>22</b>, <b>22</b> provided on the both side surfaces of the block body <b>13</b>, and a resin pipe <b>23</b> as a returning passage forming portion, which is inserted into a through-hole formed in the block body <b>13</b>. In this embodiment, the ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> and the pair of direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>22</b>, <b>22</b> are integrally formed with each other into an integral body, and the resin pipe <b>23</b> is separately formed from the above-mentioned integral body. More specifically, there is used a construction that the ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> and the pair of direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>22</b>, <b>22</b> are integrally connected with each other through integral forming to form an integral resin frame <b>24</b>, and the four resin pipes <b>23</b> can respectively be inserted into the block body <b>13</b>.</p>
    <p>The ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> are provided with guide grooves for guiding the both side edges of the belt portion <b>12</b> <i>b </i>of the ball retainer <b>12</b> in a loaded area. The guide grooves can prevent the ball retainer not only from being swung during run of the ball, but also from being sagged by engaging the side edges of the belt portion <b>12</b> <i>b </i>with the guide groove <b>21</b> <i>a</i>, when the movable block <b>4</b> is removed from the guide rail <b>2</b>. The balls <b>3</b> are supported by the ball retainer <b>12</b>. More specifically, the ball retainer <b>12</b> is supported by a jaw portion of the guide groove <b>21</b> <i>a</i>, with the result that the balls <b>3</b> are kept in its proper position so as not to come off the movable block <b>4</b>.</p>
    <p>In this embodiment, a distance between the pair of ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> arranged in parallel with each other on the both longitudinal sides of the ball running counter-groove <b>8</b> is slightly larger than the diameter of the ball <b>3</b>. The balls <b>3</b> come off the ball running counter-groove <b>8</b>, if the ball retainer <b>12</b> is not used. When an amount of projection of the jaw portion <b>21</b> <i>b </i>is predetermined so that a distance between the pair of ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> is slightly smaller than the diameter of the ball <b>3</b> as shown in FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>d</i>), it is however possible to prevent the balls <b>3</b> from coming off the ball running counter-groove <b>8</b> even without the ball retainer <b>12</b>. Such a construction can apply not only to the case where the balls <b>3</b> are inserted into the ball circulation passage with the use of the ball retainer <b>12</b>, but also to the case where the balls are inserted therein without the ball retainer <b>12</b>. The distance between the pair of ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> may be slightly smaller than the diameter of the ball <b>3</b> so that the ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> directly hold the ball <b>3</b> without the use of the ball retainer <b>12</b> as shown in FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>e</i>).</p>
    <p>Guide grooves <b>9</b> <i>c</i>, <b>10</b> <i>c </i>are also formed in the ball returning passage <b>9</b> and the direction changing passage <b>10</b> as non-loaded areas, in order to guide the side edges of the belt portion <b>12</b> <i>b</i>. The guide grooves <b>9</b> <i>c</i>, <b>10</b> <i>c </i>are connected to the above-mentioned guide groove <b>21</b> <i>a </i>in the loaded area so as to form an endless groove on the entire periphery.</p>
    <p>When the ball retainer <b>12</b> is not used as shown in FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>f</i>), the distance between the pair of ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> arranged on the both longitudinal sides of the ball running counter-groove <b>8</b>, which portions do not have any jaw portions <b>21</b>, may be slightly smaller than the diameter of the ball <b>3</b>, thus preventing the balls <b>3</b> from coming off the ball running counter-groove <b>8</b>.</p>
    <p>The four sets of ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> are composed of the first thin connecting plate portion <b>25</b> extending longitudinally along the under surface of the horizontal portion <b>6</b> of the block body <b>13</b>, a pair of second connecting plate portions <b>26</b>, <b>26</b>, which have an L-shaped cross section and extend in the longitudinal direction of the block body <b>13</b> along the corner portions between the horizontal portion <b>6</b> and the wing portions <b>7</b>, <b>7</b> of the block body <b>13</b>, and a pair of third connecting plate portions <b>27</b>, <b>27</b>, which extend in the longitudinal direction of the block body <b>13</b> along the lower surfaces of the wing portions <b>7</b>, <b>7</b> of the block body <b>13</b>.</p>
    <p>More specifically, the right and left-hand side edges of the first connecting plate portion <b>25</b> and the upper edges of the pair of right and left-hand second connecting plate portions <b>26</b>, <b>26</b> are located at the both sides of the respective ball running counter-grooves <b>8</b>, <b>8</b> provided on the under surface of the horizontal portion <b>6</b>, so as to form the ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>; <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>. The lower edges of the second connecting plate portions <b>26</b>, <b>26</b> and the inner edges of the third connecting plate portions <b>27</b>, <b>27</b> are located at the both sides of the respective ball running counter-grooves <b>8</b>, <b>8</b> provided on the respective inner surface of the wing portions <b>7</b>, <b>7</b>, so as to form the other ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>; <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>.</p>
    <p>The direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>22</b> has a thin sheet portion <b>29</b>, which is to be connected to the end surface of the block body <b>13</b>. The ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> and the resin pipe <b>23</b> are connected through the above-mentioned thin sheet portion <b>29</b>. In this embodiment, the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>22</b>, <b>22</b> and the ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> are connected by means of the thin sheet portion <b>29</b> through integral forming. The resin pipe <b>23</b> is inserted in a hole <b>34</b> formed on the thin sheet portion <b>29</b> so as to make a faucet joint, and fixed to the thin sheet portion <b>29</b>.</p>

    <p>The outer peripheral side-half pipe member <b>23</b> <i>b </i>is formed into a linear member having the same circular cross section as the outer guide groove <b>10</b> <i>b </i>for the direction changing passage, which is formed on the side cover plate <b>40</b>. The outer peripheral side-half pipe member <b>23</b> <i>b </i>has a groove portion <b>9</b> <i>b</i>, which is continuously connected to the outer guide groove <b>10</b> <i>b</i>, and side edge portions <b>23</b> <i>d </i>extending longitudinally along the groove portion <b>9</b> <i>b</i>. The side edge portions <b>23</b> <i>d </i>is provided on its outer edges with projections <b>23</b> <i>e</i>, which are to be brought into contact with the outer edges of the side edge portions <b>23</b> <i>c </i>of the inner peripheral side-half pipe member <b>23</b> <i>a </i>to form the retainer-guide groove <b>9</b> <i>c </i>for the ball retainer <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p>The inner peripheral side-half pipe member <b>23</b> <i>a </i>of the resin pipe <b>23</b> has the same length of the block body <b>13</b>. The inner peripheral side-half pipe member <b>23</b> <i>a </i>is positioned so as to be brought into contact with the back surface of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>22</b>.</p>
    <p>The outer peripheral side-half pipe member <b>23</b> <i>b </i>of the resin pipe <b>23</b> has on the other hand a longer length than the block body <b>13</b> by a length corresponding to the thickness of the thin sheet portion <b>29</b>. The outer peripheral side-half pipe members <b>23</b> <i>b </i>are inserted in the inserting holes <b>34</b> of the first and third end plate portions <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. Longitudinal positional determination of the outer peripheral side-half pipe member <b>23</b> <i>b </i>is made by bringing the both ends of the outer peripheral side-half pipe member <b>23</b> <i>b </i>inserted in the inserting holes <b>34</b> into contact with the peripheral edge of the end portion of the outer guide grooves <b>10</b> <i>b </i>for the direction changing passage, which are formed on the side cover plate <b>40</b>. The projections <b>23</b> <i>e </i>formed on the both side edges of the outer peripheral side-half pipe member <b>23</b> <i>b </i>come into contact with the outer edges of the cylindrical flange portions <b>33</b> formed on the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>22</b> to form a part of the guide groove <b>10</b> <i>c</i>, and the outer peripheral side-half pipe member <b>23</b> <i>b </i>and the inner peripheral side-half pipe member <b>23</b> <i>a </i>are restricted to be turned in the inserting hole <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p>The resin pipes <b>23</b> and the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>22</b> are accurately positioned through the inserting holes <b>34</b> formed on the first and third end plate portions <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> of the thin sheet portion <b>29</b> and a proper assembling is carried out in this manner.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 5, the side cover plate <b>40</b> is provided with an inserting recess portion <b>40</b> <i>a</i>, in which the thin sheet portion <b>29</b> is inserted, four recess portions <b>41</b> having the outer guide grooves <b>10</b> <i>b </i>for the direction changing passage, into which portions the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>22</b> are fitted, and screw-fixing portions for securing the side cover plate <b>40</b> to the block body <b>13</b>. In the screw-fixing portions, the side cover plate <b>40</b> is fixed to the block body <b>13</b> by inserting bolts <b>44</b> into holes <b>43</b> formed on the side cover plate <b>40</b> and engaging the bolts with screwed holes <b>45</b> formed on the end surface of the block body <b>13</b>. The holes <b>43</b> are located between the first and third end plate portions <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> of the thin sheet portion <b>29</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 7, the outer guide groove <b>10</b> <i>b </i>for the direction changing passage in the recess portion <b>41</b> has on its side edges larger-diameter arcuate recesses <b>46</b>, which form the retainer-guide groove <b>10</b> <i>c </i>in cooperation with the cylindrical flange portions <b>33</b> of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>22</b>, and a smaller-diameter arcuate recesses <b>47</b>, in which the cylindrical flange portions <b>33</b> are inserted. The direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>22</b> provided with the inner guide groove <b>10</b> <i>a </i>for the direction changing passage is fitted into the recess portion <b>41</b> of the side cover plate <b>40</b>, and the thin sheet portion <b>29</b> is received in the inserting recess portion <b>40</b> <i>a </i>of the side cover plate <b>40</b>. The thin sheet portion <b>29</b> is held between the side cover plate <b>40</b> and the end surface of the block body <b>13</b> through a clamping force so as to be firmly fixed therebetween.</p>
    <p>The direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>22</b> and the ball passage forming portion <b>21</b> are connected through the thin sheet portion <b>29</b>, thus making it possible to maintain an accurate positional relationship of the end of the inner guide groove <b>10</b> <i>a </i>for the direction changing passage formed in the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>22</b> relative to the ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>, as well as an accurate positional relationship of the inner guide groove <b>10</b> <i>a </i>for the direction changing passage relative to the ball returning passage <b>9</b>.</p>
    <p>The thin sheet portion <b>29</b> located in the vicinity of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>22</b> is uniformly urged against the flat end surface of the block body <b>13</b> through a clamping force applied to the side cover plate <b>40</b> (see FIG. <b>7</b>). Even when the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>22</b> is not located in a correct position, the thin sheet portion <b>29</b> changes its shape on the end surface of the block body <b>13</b>, thus permitting the correct positioning of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>22</b>. The thin sheet portion <b>29</b> is firmly clamped and fixed through a clamping force, which is applied to the side cover plate <b>40</b>, and frictional force caused by such a clamping step may prevent an unfavorable movement of the inner guide groove <b>10</b> <i>a </i>for the direction changing passage.</p>
    <p>The side cover plate <b>40</b> is secured to the block body <b>13</b> so that the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>22</b> assembled to the block body <b>13</b> is fitted into the recess portion <b>41</b> of the side cover plate <b>40</b>. Such a fitting step permits to make an accurate positioning of the side cover plate <b>40</b> relative to the block body <b>13</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 6 shows assembling steps for the above-described resin-formed body for forming the ball circulation passage.</p>
    <p>First, the inner peripheral side-half pipe member <b>23</b> <i>a </i>of the resin pipe <b>23</b> is inserted in the through-hole <b>14</b> of the block body <b>13</b> (see FIGS. <b>6</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>6</b>(<i>b</i>)).</p>
    <p>Then, the resin frame <b>24</b> obtained by integral forming is inserted in the recess of the block body <b>13</b>, while causing the thin sheet portions <b>29</b> at the both ends of the resin frame <b>24</b> to slide on the respective end surfaces of the block body <b>13</b> (see FIGS. <b>6</b>(<i>c</i>) and <b>6</b>(<i>d</i>)). The first connecting plate portion <b>25</b> of the resin frame <b>24</b> comes into contact with the under surface of the horizontal portion <b>6</b>, thus making positional determination in the vertical direction of the resin frame <b>24</b>. The second connecting plate portion <b>26</b> and the third connecting plate portion <b>27</b> of the resin frame <b>24</b> come into contact with the respective inner surfaces of the wing portions <b>7</b>, <b>7</b> of the block body <b>13</b>, thus making positional determination of the ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> and the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>22</b> (see FIGS. <b>6</b>(<i>e</i>) and <b>6</b>(<i>f</i>)). At this time, the inserting hole <b>34</b> of the thin sheet portion <b>29</b> is aligned with the through-hole <b>14</b> of the block body <b>13</b>.</p>
    <p>Then, the outer peripheral side-half pipe member <b>23</b> <i>b </i>is inserted in the through-hole <b>14</b> from the inserting hole <b>34</b>, thus completing the assembling step of the resin-formed body <b>20</b> for forming the ball circulation passage (see FIGS. <b>6</b>(<i>g</i>) and <b>6</b>(<i>h</i>)).</p>
    <p>Then, the one side cover plate <b>40</b> is secured to the one end surface of the block body <b>13</b> by a clamping step, the ball retainer <b>12</b> holding the balls is inserted, and the other side cover plate <b>40</b> is secured to the other end surface of the block body <b>13</b> by the same clamping step, thus completing the assembling step of the movable block <b>4</b>.</p>
    <p>According to the present invention, the resin-formed body <b>20</b> for forming the ball circulation passage is separately formed from the block body <b>13</b>. Even when the movable block <b>4</b> has a larger size, there is no restriction of flow of molten resin by the block body <b>13</b>, unlike the case where the block body <b>13</b> is integrally formed with the resin-formed body <b>20</b>. Increase in number of gates formed on a die may ensure proper run of the molten resin, thus improving the formability. Especially, the ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> located at the opposite longitudinal sides of the ball running groove <b>8</b> are thin, with the result that molten resin may not reach every part of the space for forming the ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>. It is therefore effective to form the resin-formed body <b>20</b> separately from the block body <b>13</b> in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p>The continuous circulation passage is formed by the resin-formed body <b>20</b>, and it is therefore possible to make positional determination of the inner guide groove <b>10</b> <i>a </i>for the direction changing passage relative to the ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>, as well as positional determination of the inner guide groove <b>10</b> <i>a </i>for the direction changing passage relative to the ball returning passage <b>9</b>, thus ensuring continuity of the circulation passage so as to make smooth circulation of the balls <b>3</b>.</p>
    <p>When the proper positional relationship of the inner guide groove <b>10</b> <i>a </i>for the direction changing passage relative to the ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>, is maintained, the ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> are located at the longitudinal both sides of the ball running groove <b>8</b> so as to be aligned with the ends of the inner guide groove <b>10</b> <i>a </i>for the direction changing passage.</p>
    <p>When the proper positional relationship of the inner guide groove <b>10</b> <i>a </i>for the direction changing passage relative to the ball returning passage <b>9</b> is maintained, the inner guide groove <b>10</b> <i>a </i>for the direction changing passage can be aligned with the inner groove <b>23</b> <i>a </i>of the ball returning passage <b>9</b>.</p>
    <p>The connecting portion of the ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> and the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>22</b> is obtained by integral forming, thus permitting omission of an assembling step of the connecting portion. Although the running direction of the balls <b>3</b> is changed in such a connecting portion, the above-mentioned integral structure may ensure continuity of the circulation passage, without being affected by assembling accuracy. It is therefore possible to make smooth run of the balls <b>3</b> from the ball running passage between the ball running groove <b>5</b> and the ball running counter-groove <b>8</b> to the direction changing passage <b>10</b>, as well as from the direction changing passage <b>10</b> to the ball returning passage <b>9</b>.</p>
    <p>Description will be given of modifications of the resin-formed body <b>20</b> for forming the ball circulation passage, which is divided into parts In the description of the modifications, modified features will only be explained in comparison with the first embodiment of the present invention. The same reference numerals will be given to the same components as those in the first embodiment of the present invention, and description thereof will be omitted.</p>
    <p>First Modification</p>
    <p>FIGS. 8 and 9 show the first modification of the resin-formed body <b>20</b> for forming the ball circulation passage, which is described in the first embodiment.</p>
    <p>In the first modification, the resin-formed body <b>20</b> for forming the ball circulation passage is composed of the first resin-formed frame <b>20</b>A, which is obtained by integrally connecting both of the ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> and the resin pipes <b>23</b> at their ends with the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>22</b>A for one side, and the second resin-formed frame <b>20</b>B, which is provided with the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>22</b>B for the other side and separately formed from the first resin-formed frame <b>20</b>A.</p>
    <p>In this case, the ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> are integrally connected with the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>2</b>A through the thin sheet portion <b>29</b>A as in the first embodiment.</p>
    <p>The direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>22</b>A are also integrally connected with the resin pipes <b>23</b> through the thin sheet portion <b>29</b>A. In this case, the resin pipe <b>23</b> is formed into a tubular integral body, although the half pipe members are used in the first embodiment. Accordingly, there exists no inserting hole <b>34</b> in the thin sheet portion <b>29</b>A, and the ball returning passage <b>9</b> is exposed on the thin sheet portion <b>29</b>A.</p>
    <p>The first resin-formed frame <b>20</b>A and the second resin-formed frame <b>20</b>B are connected, as shown in FIG. 9, by means of a joint method using the combination of a recess and a projection to be inserted therein, such as a faucet joint method. In the illustrated example, a recess portion <b>36</b> of a dove-tail groove is formed in the second resin-formed frame <b>20</b>B, and an engaging projection <b>35</b> to be engaged with the recess portion <b>36</b> is formed, on the other hand, in the ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>.</p>
    <p>In this case, the resin pipe <b>23</b> of the first resin-formed frame <b>20</b>A is inserted in the through-hole <b>14</b> of the block body <b>13</b>, and the first, second and third connecting plate portions <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> are inserted along the under surface of the horizontal portion <b>6</b> of the block body <b>13</b> and the inner surfaces of the wing portions <b>7</b>,.<b>7</b>.</p>
    <p>Then, the engaging projections <b>35</b> formed at the respective.free end portions of the first, second and third connecting plate portions <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> are engaged with the recess portions <b>36</b> formed on the thin sheet portion <b>29</b>B of the second resin-formed frame <b>24</b>B, which is arranged on the other end surface of the block body <b>13</b>.</p>
    <p>The recess portions <b>36</b> may be formed on the first resin-formed frame <b>20</b>A and the engaging projections <b>35</b> may be formed on the second resin-formed frame <b>20</b>B. The connecting method is not limited to the method described above, and there may be used any conventional connecting method, in which the ends of the divided parts can be maintained in a proper connecting position and connected.</p>
    <p>Second Modification</p>
    <p>FIGS. 10 and 11 show the second modification of the resin-formed body <b>20</b> for forming the ball circulation passage, which is described in the first embodiment.</p>
    <p>In the second modification, the resin-formed body <b>20</b> for forming the ball circulation passage, which has been obtained by integrally forming both of the ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> and the resin pipes <b>23</b> as a returning passage forming portion with a pair of direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>22</b>, <b>22</b>, is divided at the middle portion of each of the ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> and the resin pipes <b>23</b> into two parts. More specifically, the ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> and the resin pipes <b>23</b> are divided at their middle portion into the respective two half parts, and each of the thus divided two half parts is integrally formed with the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>22</b>, <b>22</b>, thus forming two resin-formed frames <b>20</b>C, <b>20</b>D having substantially the same shape.</p>
    <p>Four sets of the ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> are formed on the first, second and third connecting plate portions <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>. Recess portions <b>38</b> and engaging projections <b>37</b> to be inserted therein are formed on the divided ends of the first, second and third connecting plate portions <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> and the divided ends of the resin pipes <b>23</b>.</p>
    <p>Third Modification</p>
    <p>FIGS. 12 to <b>14</b> show the third modification of the resin-formed body <b>20</b> for forming the ball circulation passage, which is described in the first embodiment.</p>
    <p>In the third modification, there is not used the resin pipe <b>23</b> as a returning passage forming portion described in the first embodiment, and a resin-formed frame <b>20</b>E is obtained by integrally forming the first, second and third connecting plate portions <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> having the ball passage forming portions <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> with the thin sheet portions <b>29</b>, <b>29</b> each having the pair of direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>22</b>, <b>22</b>. The ball returning passage <b>9</b> is composed as a through-hole formed in the block body <b>13</b>.</p>
    <p>In this case, an engaging projection <b>39</b> <i>a</i>, which is engageable with a tapered portion <b>15</b> formed in the opening end of the ball returning passage <b>9</b> may be formed in the opening end of the ball hole <b>39</b> of the thin sheet portion <b>29</b>. Such a construction permits to make a proper connection of the end of the ball returning passage <b>9</b> and the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>22</b>.</p>
    <p>In the illustrated example, an arcuate engaging projection <b>48</b> is additionally formed on the connection portion of the outer guide groove <b>10</b> <i>b </i>for the direction changing passage with the ball returning passage <b>9</b>. The engaging projection <b>48</b> can be fitted into the ball hole <b>39</b> of the thin sheet portion <b>29</b> and engaged with the tapered portion <b>15</b> of the opening end of the ball returning passage <b>9</b>.</p>
    <p>Fourth Modification</p>
    <p>FIG. 15 shows the fourth modification of the resin-formed body <b>20</b> for forming the ball circulation passage, which is described in the first embodiment.</p>
    <p>In the fourth modification, there is not used the resin pipe <b>23</b> described in the third modification, a resin-formed frame <b>24</b>B is obtained by integrally forming the ball passage forming portions <b>21</b> with the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>22</b> for the one side, the other resin-formed frame <b>24</b>C provided with the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>22</b> for the other side is separately formed from the above-mentioned resin-formed frame <b>24</b>B, and the resin-formed frames <b>24</b>B, <b>24</b>C are connected with each other by engagement of the engaging projection <b>35</b> with the recess <b>36</b>. The structure other than the above-mentioned construction is the same as that of the third modification.</p>
    <p>Modifications of the Ball Train</p>
    <p>In the first embodiment and the first to fourth modifications, there is described that two trains of the balls are provided on the upper surface of the guide rail <b>2</b> and the single train of the balls is provided on each of the side surfaces of the guide rail <b>2</b>, so as to provide the total number of trains of four. In the present invention, the other type of ball trains can however be applied as shown in FIG. <b>16</b>. With respect to the division of the resin-formed body <b>20</b> for forming the ball circulation passage, all the modifications as shown in FIG. 16 are based on the divisional pattern of the first embodiment. All the divisional patterns of the first to fourth modifications may however be applied to the modifications of the ball train as shown in FIG. <b>16</b>.</p>
    <p>In the example as shown in FIGS. <b>16</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>16</b>(<i>b</i>), two lower and upper trains of the balls as rolling members are provided on each of the gaps between the right and left-hand side surfaces of the guide rail <b>2</b> and the inner surfaces of the right and left-hand wing portions <b>7</b>, <b>7</b> of the movable block <b>13</b>, so as to provide the total number of trains of four.</p>
    <p>FIG. <b>16</b>(<i>b</i>) shows the resin-formed body <b>20</b> in which all the ball passage forming portions for the four trains of the balls are integrally formed with each other. The resin-formed body <b>20</b> may however be divided into two resin-formed bodies <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>, which correspond to two trains of the balls for each of the right and left-hand sides of the guide rail <b>2</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p>In the example as shown in FIGS. <b>16</b>(<i>c</i>) and <b>16</b>(<i>d</i>), the movable block <b>4</b> is provided with the horizontal portion <b>6</b> facing the upper surface of the guide rail <b>2</b> and a single wing portion <b>7</b> facing the one side surface of the guide rail <b>2</b>. The single train of the balls <b>3</b> as rolling members is provided between the one side surface of the guide rail <b>2</b> and the single wing portion <b>7</b> of the movable block <b>4</b>, and the other single train of the balls <b>3</b> is provided between the upper surface of the guide rail <b>2</b> and the lower surface of the horizontal portion in the vicinity of the corner of the guide rail <b>2</b>, so as to provide the total number of trains of two.</p>
    <p>In the example as shown in FIGS. <b>16</b>(<i>e</i>) and <b>16</b>(<i>f</i>), the movable block <b>4</b> is provided with a pair of wing portions <b>7</b>, <b>7</b> between which the guide rail <b>2</b> is held at its right and left-hand surfaces. The single train of the balls <b>3</b> is provided in each of the gaps between the right and left-hand surfaces of the guide rail <b>2</b> and the inner surfaces of the right and left-hand wing portions <b>7</b>, <b>7</b> of the movable block <b>4</b>, so as to provide the total number of trains of two.</p>
    <p>In the example as shown in FIGS. <b>16</b>(<i>g</i>) and <b>16</b>(<i>h</i>), the movable block <b>4</b> is arranged along the one side surface of the guide rail <b>2</b>. Two upper and lower trains of the balls <b>3</b> are provided between the one side surface of the guide rail <b>2</b> and the movable block <b>4</b>.</p>
    <heading>SECOND EMBODIMENT</heading> <p>FIGS. 18 to <b>20</b> show a linear motion guiding apparatus of the second embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p>In the second embodiment, rollers are used as rolling members. More specifically, the linear motion guiding apparatus comprises a guide rail <b>202</b> as a guide member, extending linearly, and a movable block <b>204</b> arranged so as to be movable along the guide rail <b>202</b> through a large number of rollers <b>203</b> as rolling members.</p>
    <p>The guide rail <b>202</b> is formed into a long bar shape having a rectangular cross-section. Two roller running surfaces <b>205</b>, <b>205</b> as a rolling member running track are formed on the horizontal upper surface of the guide rail <b>2</b>, and a single roller running surface <b>205</b> as the rolling member running track is formed on each of the right and left-hand vertical surfaces of the guide rail <b>2</b>, so as to provide a total number of surfaces <b>5</b> of four.</p>
    <p>The movable block <b>204</b> is formed as a block body having an inverse U-shaped cross-section, with its opening end being directed downwardly. The block body is provided with a horizontal portion <b>206</b>, which faces the upper surface of the guide rail <b>202</b> and with a pair of wing portions <b>207</b>, <b>207</b>, which extend downwardly from the right and left ends of the horizontal portion <b>206</b> and face the right and left-hand side surfaces of the guide rail <b>202</b>, respectively. The horizontal portion <b>206</b> has on its lower surface two roller running counter-surfaces <b>208</b>, <b>208</b> as a rolling member running counter-track, which correspond to the roller running surfaces <b>205</b>, <b>205</b> formed on the upper surface of the guide rail <b>202</b>. Each of the wing portions <b>207</b>, <b>207</b> has on its inner surface a single roller running counter-surface <b>208</b> as the rolling member running counter-track, which corresponds to the respective roller running surfaces <b>205</b>, <b>205</b> formed on the right and left-hand side surfaces of the guide rail <b>202</b>.</p>
    <p>In addition, in the movable block <b>204</b>, there are formed four roller returning passages <b>209</b>, <b>209</b>, <b>209</b>, <b>209</b> as a rolling member returning passage, which are provided in parallel with the four roller running counter-surfaces <b>208</b>, <b>208</b>, <b>208</b>, <b>208</b>, respectively, as well as four pairs of direction changing passages <b>210</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>210</b> each having a U-shape, for connecting the respective both ends of the roller running counter-surfaces <b>208</b>, <b>208</b>, <b>208</b>, <b>208</b> with the respective both ends of the roller returning passages <b>209</b>, <b>209</b>, <b>209</b>, <b>209</b>, so as to form four endless circulation passages.</p>
    <p>The roller returning passages <b>209</b>, <b>209</b> respectively corresponding to the roller running surfaces <b>205</b>, <b>205</b> formed on the upper side of the guide rail <b>202</b> are formed in the horizontal portion <b>206</b>. The other roller returning passages <b>209</b>, <b>209</b> respectively corresponding to the roller running surfaces <b>205</b>, <b>205</b> formed on the right and left-hand vertical surfaces of the guide rail <b>202</b> are formed in the wing portions <b>207</b>, <b>207</b> of the movable block <b>204</b>, respectively.</p>
    <p>In each of the endless circulation passages in this embodiment, the rollers <b>3</b> are retained in the form of train by means a roller retainer <b>212</b> as a rolling member retainer so that the rollers <b>203</b> can be circulated while being guided by the roller retainer <b>212</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIGS. <b>19</b>(<i>b</i>) to <b>19</b>(<i>d</i>), the roller retainer <b>212</b> comprises a flexible belt portion <b>212</b> <i>b</i>, which is provided with roller holes <b>212</b> <i>a </i>for respectively receiving the rollers <b>203</b>, and spacing portions <b>212</b> <i>c </i>provided between the adjacent two rollers <b>203</b>, <b>203</b>. The belt portion <b>212</b> <i>b </i>has a width longer than the diameter of the roller <b>203</b> so that the both side edges of the belt portion <b>212</b> <i>b </i>extend outwardly from the roller <b>203</b>.</p>

    <p>First Modification</p>
    <p>FIGS. 21 and 22 show the first modification of the resin-formed body <b>20</b> for forming the ball circulation passage, which is described in the second embodiment.</p>
    <p>In the first modification, the resin-formed body <b>220</b> for forming the ball circulation passage is composed of the first resin-formed frame <b>220</b>A, which is obtained by integrally connecting both of the roller passage forming portions <b>221</b>, <b>221</b> and the resin pipes <b>223</b> at their ends with the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>222</b>A for one side, and the second resin-formed frame <b>220</b>B, which is provided with the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>222</b>B for the other side and separately formed from the first resin-formed frame <b>220</b>A.</p>
    <p>In this case, the roller passage forming portions <b>221</b>, <b>221</b> are integrally connected with the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>222</b>A through the thin sheet portion <b>229</b>A as in the second embodiment.</p>
    <p>The direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>222</b> are also integrally connected with the resin pipes <b>223</b> through the thin sheet portion <b>229</b>A. In this case, the resin pipe <b>223</b> is formed into a tubular integral body, although the half pipe members are used in the second embodiment. Accordingly, there exists no inserting hole <b>234</b> in the thin sheet portion <b>229</b>A, and the roller returning passage <b>209</b> is exposed on the thin sheet portion <b>229</b>A.</p>
    <p>The first resin-formed frame <b>220</b>A and the second resin-formed frame <b>220</b>B are connected, as shown in FIG. 22, by means of a joint method using the combination of a recess and a projection to be inserted therein, such as a faucet joint method. In the illustrated example, a recess portion <b>236</b> of a dove-tail groove is formed in the second resin-formed frame <b>220</b>B, and an engaging projection <b>235</b> to be engaged with the recess portion <b>236</b> is formed, on the other hand, in the roller passage forming portions <b>221</b>, <b>221</b>.</p>
    <p>In this case, the resin pipe <b>223</b> of the first resin-formed frame <b>220</b>A is inserted in the through-hole <b>214</b> of the block body <b>213</b>, and the roller passage forming portions <b>221</b>, <b>221</b> and the connecting plate portion <b>226</b> are inserted along the under surface of the horizontal portion <b>206</b> of the block body <b>213</b> and the inner surfaces of the wing portions <b>207</b>,.<b>207</b>.</p>

    <p>The recess portions <b>236</b> may be formed on the first resin-formed frame <b>220</b>A and the engaging projections <b>235</b> may be formed on the second resin-formed frame <b>220</b>B. The connecting method is not limited to the method described above, and there may be used any conventional connecting method in which the ends of the divided parts can be maintained in a proper connecting position and connected.</p>
    <p>Second Modification</p>
    <p>FIGS. 23 and 24 show the second modification of the resin-formed body <b>220</b> for forming the ball circulation passage, which is described in the second embodiment.</p>
    <p>In the second modification, the resin-formed body <b>220</b> for forming the roller circulation passage, which has been obtained by integrally forming both of the roller passage forming portions <b>221</b>, <b>221</b> and the resin pipes <b>223</b> as a returning passage forming portion with a pair of direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>222</b>, <b>222</b>, is divided at the middle portion of each of the roller passage forming portions <b>221</b>, <b>221</b> and the resin pipes <b>223</b> into two parts. More specifically, the roller passage forming portions <b>221</b>, <b>221</b> and the resin pipes <b>223</b> are divided at their middle portion into the respective two half parts, and each of the thus divided two half parts is integrally formed with the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>222</b>, <b>222</b>, thus forming two resin-formed frames <b>220</b>C, <b>220</b>D having substantially the same shape.</p>
    <p>Recess portions <b>238</b> and engaging projections <b>237</b> to be inserted therein are formed on the divided ends of the roller passage forming portions <b>221</b>, <b>221</b> and the divided ends of the connecting plate portion <b>226</b> and the divided ends of the resin pipes <b>223</b>.</p>
    <p>Third Modification</p>
    <p>FIGS. 25 to <b>26</b> show the third modification of the resin-formed body <b>220</b> for forming the roller circulation passage, which is described in the second embodiment.</p>
    <p>In the third modification, there is not used the resin pipe <b>223</b> as a returning passage forming portion described in the second embodiment, and a resin-formed frame <b>220</b>E is obtained by integrally forming the both of the roller passage forming portions and the connecting plate portion <b>226</b> with the thin sheet portions <b>229</b>, <b>229</b> each having the pair of direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>222</b>, <b>222</b>.

    <p>In the second embodiment and the first to fourth modifications, there is described that two trains of the rollers are provided on the upper surface of the guide rail <b>2</b> and the single train of the rollers is provided on each of the side surfaces of the guide rail <b>2</b>, so as to provide the total number of trains of four. In the present invention, the other type of roller trains can however be applied as shown in the figures. With respect to the division of the resin-formed body <b>220</b> for forming the roller circulation passage, all the modifications are based on the divisional pattern of the first embodiment. All the divisional patterns of the first to fourth modifications may however be applied to the modifications of the roller train.</p>
    <p>In the example as shown in FIG. 27, two lower and upper trains of the rollers as rolling members are provided on each of the gaps between the right and left-hand side surfaces of the guide rail <b>202</b> and the inner surfaces of the right and left-hand wing portions <b>207</b>, <b>207</b> of the movable block <b>204</b>, so as to provide the total number of trains of four.</p>
    <p>In this case, four inner guide portions <b>210</b> <i>a </i>corresponding to the four trains of the rollers <b>203</b> are integrally formed with each other in the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>222</b>.</p>
    <p>In the above description, the present invention is applied to the linear motion guiding apparatus, in which the movable block is arranged on the guide rail as a track shaft through the rolling members. The present invention may however be applied to a so-called ball-spline, in which an outer tube as a movable member is fitted on a spline shaft as a track shaft, as described below.</p>
    <heading>THIRD EMBODIMENT</heading> <p>A ball spline <b>301</b> as shown in FIGS. 28 to <b>30</b> is of a so-called “angular contact” ball spline, and has a spline shaft <b>302</b> as a guide member extending linearly and an outer tube <b>304</b> arranged so as to be movable along the spline shaft <b>302</b> through balls <b>303</b> as a large number of rolling members.</p>
    <p>The spline shaft <b>304</b> is formed into a long bar shape having a circular cross-section. The spline shaft <b>304</b> has on its outer periphery three projections <b>306</b>. Two ball running grooves <b>305</b>, <b>305</b> are formed on the both sides of each of the projections <b>306</b>, so as to provide the total number of groove of six.</p>
    <p>The outer tube <b>304</b> has on its inner periphery three recesses <b>307</b> corresponding to the projections <b>306</b> of the spline shaft <b>302</b>, respectively. Ball running counter-grooves <b>308</b>, <b>308</b> are formed at the both corners of each of the recesses <b>307</b>, so as to correspond to the above-mentioned ball running</p>
    <p>In addition, the outer tube <b>304</b> has six ball returning passage <b>309</b>, <b>309</b>; <b>309</b>, <b>309</b>; <b>309</b>, <b>309</b>, which are in parallel with the six ball running counter-grooves <b>308</b>, <b>308</b>; <b>308</b>, <b>308</b>; <b>308</b>, <b>308</b>, and six direction changing passages <b>310</b>, <b>310</b>; <b>310</b>, <b>310</b>; <b>310</b>, <b>310</b> formed into a U-shaped tube, which connect the ends of the above-mentioned ball running counter-grooves <b>308</b>, <b>308</b>; <b>308</b>, <b>308</b>; <b>308</b>, <b>308</b> with the ends of the above-mentioned ball returning passage <b>309</b>, <b>309</b>; <b>309</b>, <b>309</b>; <b>309</b>, <b>309</b>. The outer tube <b>304</b> has six circulation passages in this manner.</p>
    <p>The ball arranged at each of the both side surfaces of the projection <b>306</b> of the spline shaft <b>302</b> comes in contact, at its opposite points, with the ball running groove <b>305</b> and the ball running counter-groove <b>308</b>, respectively. A line connecting the above-mentioned contact points is referred to as the “contact angle line”. A contact angle α, i.e., an angle between the contact angle line and the radius line, which connects the center of the spline shaft <b>302</b> and the central portion of the projection <b>306</b> is relatively large. The ball returning passage <b>309</b> is located on the contact angle line.</p>
    <p>In this third embodiment, the balls <b>303</b> inserted in each of the circulation passages are connected with each other by means of a ball retainer <b>312</b> so as to form the train of the balls <b>303</b>. The balls <b>303</b> are guided by means of the ball retainer <b>312</b> and circulated in each of the circulation passages. The ball retainer <b>312</b> has the same structure as shown in FIG. <b>14</b> and the description thereof is therefore omitted.</p>
    <p>The outer tube <b>304</b> is composed of a tubular main body <b>313</b> having the ball running counter-grooves <b>308</b>, <b>308</b>; <b>308</b>, <b>308</b>; <b>308</b>, <b>308</b>, three resin-formed bodies <b>320</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>320</b> for forming the ball circulation passage, which are to be inserted in the main body <b>313</b>, and a pair of side cover plates <b>314</b>, <b>314</b> secured on the both ends of the main body <b>313</b> after the insertion of the resin-formed bodies <b>320</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>320</b> in the main body <b>313</b>.</p>
    <p>In the third embodiment, the six circulation passages are formed by the three resin-formed bodies <b>320</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>320</b>.</p>
    <p>Each of the circulation passages <b>311</b> of the resin-formed bodies <b>320</b> for forming the ball circulation passage has a pair of the ball passage forming portions <b>321</b>, <b>321</b> extending along the longitudinal side edges of the ball running counter-groove <b>308</b>, a pair of direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>322</b>, <b>322</b> provided on the both ends of the main body <b>313</b>, and resin pipes <b>323</b> as a returning passage forming portion, which are inserted in through-holes formed in the main body <b>313</b>.</p>
    <p>The ball passage forming portions <b>321</b>, <b>321</b> are provided with guide grooves for guiding the both side edges of the belt portion <b>312</b> <i>b </i>of the ball retainer <b>312</b> in a loaded area. The guide grooves can prevent the ball retainer <b>312</b> not only from being swung during run of the ball, but also from being sagged by engaging the side edges of the belt portion <b>312</b> <i>b </i>with the guide groove <b>321</b> <i>a</i>, when the outer tube <b>304</b> is removed from the spline shaft <b>302</b>. The balls <b>303</b> are supported by the ball retainer <b>312</b>. More specifically, the ball retainer <b>312</b> is supported by a jaw portion of the guide groove <b>321</b> <i>a</i>, with the result that the balls <b>303</b> are kept in its proper position so as not to come off the outer tube <b>304</b>.</p>
    <p>Guide grooves <b>309</b> <i>c</i>, <b>310</b> <i>c </i>are also formed in the ball returning passage <b>309</b> and the direction changing passage <b>310</b> as non-loaded areas, in order to guide the side edges of the belt portion <b>312</b> <i>b</i>. The guide grooves <b>309</b> <i>c</i>, <b>310</b> <i>c </i>are connected to the above-mentioned guide groove <b>321</b> <i>a </i>in the loaded area so as to form an endless groove on the entire periphery.</p>
    <p>In each of the resin-formed bodies <b>320</b> for forming the ball circulation passage, the ball passage forming portions <b>321</b>, <b>321</b> and the pair of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>322</b>, <b>322</b> are integrally connected with each other. The resin-formed body <b>320</b> is divided at the other portions into separate parts so as to be able to be inserted in the main body <b>313</b>. In the third embodiment, a single resin frame <b>324</b> is obtained by integrally connecting the ends of the four sets of ball passage forming portions <b>321</b>, <b>321</b> with the end of the pair of direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>322</b>, <b>322</b>, and the thus obtained resin frame <b>324</b> is divided at the connecting portion of the returning passage forming portion <b>323</b> with the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>322</b>, <b>322</b> into the separate parts so as to be able to be inserted in the main body <b>313</b>.</p>
    <p>The adjacent two of the roller passage forming portions <b>321</b>, <b>321</b>, <b>321</b>, <b>321</b> are integrally connected with each other by means of a thin connecting sheet portion <b>326</b>. The direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>322</b> is integrally formed with the thin sheet portion <b>329</b>, which is to be brought into contact with the end surface of the main body <b>313</b>.</p>
    <p>The thin sheet portion <b>329</b> is provided with the first end plate portions <b>330</b>, <b>330</b> and the second end plate portion <b>231</b> for connecting the first end plate portions <b>330</b>, <b>330</b> with each other. Each of the pair of ball passage forming portions <b>321</b>, <b>321</b> is integrally connected with the inner edge of the first end plate portion <b>230</b>. The both ends of the connecting plate portion <b>326</b> are integrally connected with the inner edge of the second end plate portion <b>331</b>.</p>
    <p>Each of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>322</b> has a semi-cylindrical shape. On the outer periphery of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>322</b>, there is formed an inner guide groove <b>310</b> <i>a </i>having a semi-circular cross section so as to form the inner guide portion for the direction changing passage <b>310</b>. The one end of the inner guide groove <b>310</b> <i>a </i>is connected to the end of the ball running counter-groove <b>308</b>. Accordingly, the one end of the inner guide groove <b>310</b> <i>a </i>has the same cross-sectional shape as the ball running counter-groove <b>308</b> so as to make an alignment of the one end of the inner guide groove <b>310</b> <i>a </i>with the end of the ball running counter-groove <b>308</b>. The other end of the inner guide groove <b>310</b> <i>a </i>of the direction changing passage <b>310</b> is connected to the end of the ball returning passage <b>309</b>. Accordingly, the other end of the inner guide groove <b>310</b> <i>a </i>has the same cross-sectional shape as the ball returning passage <b>309</b> so as to make an alignment of the other end of the inner guide groove <b>310</b> <i>a </i>with the end of the ball returning passage <b>309</b>.</p>
    <p>Cylindrical flange portions <b>333</b>, <b>333</b> are formed on the both ends of the inner guide groove <b>310</b> <i>a</i>. The distance between the respective outer surfaces of the cylindrical flange portions <b>333</b>, <b>333</b> is larger than the width of the belt portion <b>312</b> <i>b</i>. The cylindrical flange portions <b>333</b>, <b>333</b> form a retainer-guide groove <b>310</b> <i>c </i>for the ball retainer <b>312</b> in cooperation with the side cover plate <b>340</b> described later.</p>
    <p>The both ends of the inner guide groove <b>310</b> <i>a </i>for the direction changing passage <b>310</b> extend to the contacting surface of the first end plate portion <b>330</b> with the end surface of the main body <b>313</b> so as to be connected to the respective ends of the ball running counter-groove <b>308</b> and the ball returning passage <b>309</b>.</p>
    <p>Pipe inserting holes <b>334</b>, <b>334</b> having a semi-circular shape, in which the ends of for the outer peripheral side-half pipe member <b>323</b> <i>a </i>for the resin pipes <b>323</b> for forming the roller returning passage <b>309</b> are to be inserted are formed on the first and third end plate portions <b>330</b>, <b>332</b> of the thin sheet portion <b>329</b>. The resin pipe <b>323</b> is inserted into the circular through-hole <b>314</b> formed in the main body <b>313</b> so that the inner peripheral surface of the resin pipe <b>323</b> form the ball returning passage <b>309</b>.</p>
    <p>The resin pipe <b>323</b> is composed of the inner peripheral side-half pipe member <b>323</b> <i>a</i>, which is continuously connected to the inner guide groove <b>310</b> <i>a </i>for the direction changing passage, and the outer peripheral side-half pipe member <b>323</b> <i>b</i>, which is continuously connected to the outer guide groove <b>310</b> <i>b </i>for the direction changing passage <b>310</b>, which is formed on the side cover plate <b>340</b>. The inner peripheral side-half pipe member <b>323</b> <i>a </i>has an inner groove portion <b>309</b> <i>a </i>having a rectangular cross section, and side edge portions <b>323</b> <i>b </i>extending longitudinally along the inner groove portion <b>309</b> <i>a</i>. The longitudinal edge portions <b>323</b> <i>c </i>of the inner peripheral side-half pipe member <b>323</b> <i>a </i>has the same width as the flange portion <b>333</b> of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>322</b>.</p>
    <p>The outer peripheral side-half pipe member <b>323</b> <i>b </i>is formed into a linear member having the same rectangular cross section as the outer guide groove <b>310</b> <i>b </i>for the direction changing passage, which is formed on the side cover plate <b>340</b>. The outer peripheral side-half pipe member <b>323</b> <i>b </i>has a outer groove portion <b>309</b> <i>b</i>, which is continuously connected to the outer guide groove <b>310</b> <i>b</i>, and side edge portions <b>323</b> <i>d </i>extending longitudinally along the outer groove portion <b>309</b> <i>b</i>. The side edge portions <b>323</b> <i>d </i>is provided on its outer edges with projections <b>323</b> <i>e</i>, which are to be brought into contact with the side edge portions <b>323</b> <i>c </i>of the inner peripheral side-half pipe member <b>323</b> <i>a </i>to form the guide groove for the belt portion <b>312</b> of the ball retainer <b>312</b>.</p>
    <p>The inner peripheral side-half pipe member <b>323</b> <i>a </i>of the resin pipe <b>323</b> has the same length of the main body <b>313</b>. The inner peripheral side-half pipe member <b>323</b> <i>a </i>is positioned so as to be brought into contact with the end surface of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>322</b>, which is arranged on the side of the main body <b>313</b>.</p>
    <p>The outer peripheral side-half pipe member <b>323</b> <i>b </i>of the resin pipe <b>323</b> has on the other hand a longer length than the main body <b>313</b> by a length corresponding to the thickness of the first end plate portions <b>330</b>, <b>330</b> of the thin sheet portion <b>329</b>, which are arranged on the both ends of the main body <b>313</b>. The outer peripheral side-half pipe members <b>323</b> <i>b </i>are inserted in the inserting holes <b>334</b> of the first end plate portions <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>. Longitudinal positional determination of the outer peripheral side-half pipe member <b>323</b> <i>b </i>is made by bringing the both ends of the outer peripheral side-half pipe member <b>323</b> <i>b </i>inserted in the inserting holes <b>334</b> into contact with the peripheral edge of the end portion of the outer guide grooves <b>310</b> <i>b </i>for the direction changing passage, which are formed on the side cover plate <b>340</b>. The projections <b>323</b> <i>e </i>formed on the both longitudinal side edges <b>323</b> of the outer peripheral side-half pipe member <b>323</b> <i>b </i>come into contact with the outer edges of the cylindrical flange portions of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>322</b> to form a guide groove, and the outer peripheral side-half pipe member <b>323</b> <i>b </i>and the inner peripheral side-half pipe member <b>323</b> <i>a </i>are restricted to be turned in the inserting hole <b>314</b>.</p>
    <p>The resin pipes <b>323</b> and,the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>322</b> as the ball returning passage forming portions are accurately positioned through the inserting holes <b>334</b> formed on the first end plate portion <b>330</b>, <b>330</b> of the thin sheet portion <b>329</b> and a proper assembling is carried out in this manner.</p>
    <p>The side cover plate <b>340</b> is provided with four recess portions <b>341</b> having the outer guide grooves <b>310</b> <i>b </i>for the direction changing passage, into which the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>322</b> are fitted, and screw-fixing portions for securing the side cover plate <b>340</b> to the main body <b>313</b>. In the screw-fixing portions, the side cover plate <b>340</b> is fixed to the main body <b>313</b> by inserting bolts <b>344</b> into holes <b>343</b> formed on the side cover plate <b>340</b> and engaging the bolts <b>344</b> with screwed holes <b>345</b> formed on the end surface of the main body <b>313</b>. The holes <b>343</b> are located between the first end plate portions <b>330</b>, <b>330</b> of the thin sheet portion <b>329</b>.</p>
    <p>The direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>322</b> is fitted into the recess portion <b>341</b> of the side cover plate <b>340</b>. The thin sheet portion <b>329</b> is held between the side cover plate <b>340</b> and the end surface of the main body <b>313</b> through a clamping force so as to be firmly fixed therebetween.</p>
    <p>The direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>322</b> and the ball passage forming portion <b>321</b> are connected through the thin sheet portion <b>329</b>, thus making it possible to maintain an accurate positional relationship of the end of the inner guide groove <b>310</b> <i>a </i>for the direction changing passage relative to the ball passage forming portions <b>321</b>, as well as an accurate positional relationship of the inner guide groove <b>310</b> <i>a </i>for the direction changing passage relative to the ball returning passage <b>309</b>.</p>
    <p>The thin sheet portion <b>329</b> is uniformly urged against the flat end surface of the main body <b>313</b> through a clamping force applied to the side cover plate <b>340</b>. Even when the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>322</b> is not located in a correct position, the thin sheet portion <b>329</b> changes its shape, thus permitting the correct positioning of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>322</b>. The thin sheet portion <b>329</b> is firmly clamped and fixed through a clamping force, which is applied to the side cover plate <b>340</b>, and frictional force caused by such a clamping step may prevent an unfavorable movement of the inner guide groove <b>310</b> <i>a </i>for the direction changing passage.</p>
    <p>According to the present invention, only the ball running counter-groove <b>308</b> for the circulation passage <b>311</b> is formed of the main body <b>313</b> having high rigidity, and the other portions are formed of the resin-formed bodies <b>320</b> for forming the ball circulation passage. Precision working of the ball running counter-groove <b>308</b> of the main body <b>313</b> suffices, thus permitting reduction in steps for working and decrease in the production cost.</p>
    <p>The resin-formed body <b>320</b> for forming the ball circulation passage is separately formed from the main body <b>313</b>. Even when the outer tube <b>304</b> has a larger size, there is no restriction of flow of molten resin by the main body <b>313</b>, unlike the case where the main body <b>313</b> is integrally formed with the resin-formed body <b>320</b>. Increase in number of gates formed on a die may ensure proper run of the molten resin, thus improving the formability. Especially, the ball passage forming portions <b>321</b>, <b>321</b> located at the opposite longitudinal sides of the ball running groove <b>308</b> are thin, with the result that molten resin may not reach every part of the space for forming the ball passage forming portions <b>321</b>, <b>321</b>. It is therefore effective to form the resin-formed body <b>320</b> separately from the main body <b>313</b> in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p>The ball passage forming portions <b>321</b>, <b>321</b> are continuously and integrally connected with the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>322</b>, and the divided parts are jointed so as to make alignment of them to make a faucet joint. It is therefore possible to ensure a proper continuity of the connecting portion of the circulation passage and to make smooth run of the balls <b>303</b> from the ball running passage between the ball running groove <b>305</b> and the ball running counter-groove <b>308</b> to the direction changing passage <b>310</b>, as well as from the direction changing passage <b>310</b> to the ball returning passage <b>309</b>.</p>
    <p>Description will be given of modifications of the resin-formed body <b>320</b> for forming the ball circulation passage, which is divided into parts In the description of the modifications, modified features will only be explained in comparison with the third embodiment of the present invention. The same reference numerals will be given to the same components as those in the third embodiment of the present invention, and description thereof will be omitted.</p>
    <p>First Modification</p>
    <p>FIGS. 31 and 32 show the first modification of the resin-formed body <b>320</b> for forming the ball circulation passage, which is described in the third embodiment.</p>
    <p>In the first modification, the resin-formed body <b>320</b> for forming the ball circulation passage is composed of the first resin-formed frame <b>320</b>A, which is obtained by integrally connecting both of the ball passage forming portions <b>321</b>, <b>321</b> and the resin pipes <b>323</b> at their ends with the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>322</b>A for one side, and the second resin formed frame <b>320</b>B, which is provided with the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>322</b>B for the other side and separately formed from the first resin-formed frame <b>320</b>A.</p>
    <p>In this case, the ball passage forming portions <b>321</b>, <b>321</b> are integrally connected with the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>322</b>A through the thin sheet portion <b>329</b>A as in the first embodiment.</p>
    <p>The direction changing passage.-inner guide forming portions <b>322</b>A are also integrally connected with the resin pipes <b>323</b> through the thin sheet portion <b>329</b>A. In this case, the resin pipe <b>323</b> is formed into a tubular integral body, although the half pipe members are used in the third embodiment. Accordingly, there exists no inserting hole s<b>34</b> in the thin sheet portion <b>329</b>A, and the ball returning passage <b>309</b> is exposed on the thin sheet portion <b>329</b>A.</p>
    <p>The first resin-formed frame <b>320</b>A and the second resin-formed frame <b>320</b>B are connected, as shown in FIG. 32, by means of a joint method using the combination of a recess and a projection to be inserted therein, such as a faucet joint method. In the illustrated example, a recess portion <b>336</b> of a dove-tail groove is formed in the second resin-formed frame <b>320</b>B, and an engaging projection <b>335</b> to be engaged with the recess portion <b>336</b> is formed, on the other hand, in the ball passage forming portions <b>321</b>, <b>321</b>.</p>
    <p>In this case, the resin pipe <b>323</b> of the first resin-formed frame <b>320</b>A is inserted in the through-hole <b>314</b> of the main body <b>313</b>, and the ball passage forming portions <b>321</b>, <b>321</b> and the connecting plate portion <b>236</b> are inserted along the inner surface of the recess <b>307</b> of the main body <b>313</b>.</p>
    <p>Then, the engaging projections <b>335</b> formed at the respective free end portions of the ball passage forming portions <b>321</b>, <b>321</b> and the connecting plate portion <b>326</b> are engaged with the recess portions <b>336</b> formed on the thin sheet portion <b>329</b>B of the second resin-formed frame <b>324</b>B, which is arranged on the other end surface of the main body <b>313</b>.</p>
    <p>The recess portions <b>336</b> may be formed on the first resin-formed frame <b>320</b>A and the engaging projections <b>335</b> may be formed on the second resin-formed frame <b>320</b>B. The connecting method is not limited to the method described above, and there may be used any conventional connecting method, in which the ends of the divided parts can be maintained in a proper connecting position and connected.</p>
    <p>Second Modification</p>
    <p>FIGS. 33 and 34 show the second modification of the resin-formed body <b>320</b> for forming the ball circulation passage, which is described in the third embodiment.</p>
    <p>In the second modification, the resin-formed body <b>320</b> for forming the ball circulation passage, which has been obtained by integrally forming both of the ball passage forming portions <b>321</b>, <b>321</b> and the resin pipes <b>323</b> as a returning passage forming portion with a pair of direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>322</b>, <b>322</b>, is divided at the middle portion of each of the ball passage forming portions <b>321</b>, <b>321</b> and the ball returning passage forming portions <b>323</b> into two parts. More specifically, the ball passage forming portions <b>321</b>, <b>321</b> and the ball returning passage forming portions <b>323</b> are divided at their middle portion into the respective two half parts, and each of the thus divided two half parts is integrally formed with the direction resin-formed frames <b>320</b>C, <b>320</b>D having substantially the same shape.</p>
    <p>Recess portions <b>338</b> and engaging projections <b>337</b> to be inserted therein are formed on the divided ends of the ball passage forming portions <b>321</b>, <b>321</b>, the divided ends of the central connecting plate portion <b>326</b> and the divided ends of the resin pipes <b>323</b>.</p>
    <p>Third Modification</p>
    <p>FIG. 35 shows the third modification of the resin-formed body <b>320</b> for forming the ball circulation passage, which is described in the third embodiment.</p>
    <p>In the third modification, there is not used the resin pipe <b>323</b> as a returning passage forming portion described in the first embodiment, and a resin-formed frame <b>320</b>E is obtained by integrally forming the ball passage forming portions, the connecting plate portions <b>326</b> with the thin sheet portions <b>329</b>, <b>329</b> each having the pair of direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>322</b>, <b>322</b>. The ball returning passage <b>309</b> is composed as a through-hole formed in the main body <b>313</b>.</p>
    <p>In this case, an engaging projection <b>339</b> <i>a</i>, which is engageable with a tapered portion <b>315</b> formed in the opening end of the ball returning passage <b>309</b> may be formed in the opening end of the ball hole <b>339</b> of the thin sheet portion <b>329</b>. Such a construction permits to make a proper connection of the end of the ball returning passage <b>309</b> and the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>322</b>.</p>
    <p>In the illustrated example, an arcuate engaging projection <b>348</b> is additionally formed on the connection portion of the outer guide groove <b>310</b> <i>b </i>formed on the side cover plate <b>340</b> with the ball returning passage <b>309</b>. The engaging projection <b>48</b> can be engaged with the thin sheet portion <b>329</b>.</p>
    <p>Fourth Modification</p>
    <p>FIG. 36 shows the fourth modification of the resin-formed body <b>320</b> for forming the ball circulation passage, which is described in the third embodiment.</p>
    <p>In the fourth modification, there is not used the resin pipe <b>323</b> described in the third modification, a resin-formed frame <b>320</b>F is obtained by integrally forming the ball passage forming portions <b>321</b> with the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>322</b> for the one side, the other resin-formed frame <b>320</b>G provided with the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>322</b> for the other side is separately formed from the above-mentioned resin-formed frame <b>320</b>F, and the resin-formed frames <b>320</b>F, <b>320</b>G are connected with each other by engagement of the engaging projection <b>335</b> with the recess <b>336</b>. The structure other than the above-mentioned construction is the same as that of the third modification.</p>
    <p>In the third embodiment described above, there are used three sets of resin-formed bodies for forming the ball circulation passage, each of which is divided into two parts. Six sets of resin-formed bodies may however be used for the respective circulation passages. The single set of resin-formed body may also be used. In this case, the divisional method of the resin-formed body should be based on the first, second and fourth modifications described above, taking into consideration the difficulty of insertion of the resin-formed body into the main body of the outer tube.</p>
    <p>Modifications of the Ball Train</p>
    <p>In the third embodiment and the first to fourth modifications thereof, the ball spline has the angular contact type ball train. The present invention may also be applied to the ball spline having the radial contact type ball train as shown in FIG. <b>37</b>. In such a radial contact type ball train, the spline shaft has no projections on the outer periphery so as to reveal the circular cross-section, and the outer tube has no recesses on the inner periphery so as to reveal the hollow cylindrical shape. The radial contact type ball train has the smaller contact angle a than that of the angular contact type ball train. With respect to the divisional method of the resin-formed body <b>320</b> for forming the ball circulation passage, all the patterns described in the third embodiment and the first to fourth modifications thereof may be used.</p>
    <p>In the example illustrated in FIG. 37, six resin-formed bodies <b>320</b> for forming the ball circulation passage are separately provided from each other for the respective six ball trains. The two sets of resin-formed bodies <b>320</b> mentioned above may be integrally formed with each other so as to prepare three sets of resin-formed bodies <b>320</b> having the six ball circulation passages. The single resin-formed body having the six ball circulation passages may also be used.</p>
    <heading>FOURTH EMBODIMENT</heading> <p>FIGS. 38 and 39 illustrate the forth embodiment of the present invention. In the fourth embodiment, the present invention is applied to a roller spline, in which rollers are used as the rolling members.</p>
    <p>The roller spline <b>401</b> as shown in FIG. 38 is composed of a spline shaft <b>402</b> as a guide member extending linearly, and an outer tube <b>404</b> arranged so as to be movable along the spline shaft <b>402</b> through the rollers <b>403</b> as the rolling members.</p>
    <p>The spline shaft <b>402</b> is formed into a long bar shape having a modified cross-section. The spline shaft <b>402</b> has on its outer periphery three projections <b>406</b>. Two roller running surfaces <b>405</b>, <b>405</b> are formed on the both sides of each of the projections <b>406</b>, so as to provide the total number of running surfaces of six.</p>
    <p>The outer tube <b>404</b> has on its inner periphery three recesses <b>407</b> corresponding to the projections <b>406</b> of the spline shaft <b>402</b>, respectively. Roller running counter-surfaces <b>408</b>, <b>408</b> are formed at the both corners of each of the recesses <b>407</b>, so as to correspond to the above-mentioned roller running surfaces <b>405</b>, <b>405</b>.</p>
    <p>In addition, the outer tube <b>404</b> has six roller returning passage <b>409</b>, <b>409</b>; <b>409</b>, <b>409</b>; <b>409</b>, <b>409</b>, which are in parallel with the six roller running counter-surfaces <b>408</b>, <b>408</b>; <b>408</b>, <b>408</b>; <b>408</b>, <b>408</b>, and six direction changing passages <b>410</b>, <b>410</b>; <b>410</b>, <b>410</b>; <b>410</b>, <b>410</b> formed into a U-shaped tube, which connect the ends of the above-mentioned roller running counter-surfaces <b>408</b>, <b>408</b>; <b>408</b>, <b>408</b>; <b>408</b>, <b>408</b> with the ends of the above-mentioned roller returning passage <b>409</b>, <b>409</b>; <b>409</b>, <b>409</b>; <b>409</b>, <b>409</b>. The outer tube <b>404</b> has six circulation passages in this manner.</p>
    <p>The rollers <b>403</b> inserted in each of the circulation passages are connected with each other by means of the same roller retainer <b>412</b> as the roller retainer <b>212</b> shown in FIG. 19, so as to form the train of the rollers <b>403</b>. The rollers <b>403</b> are guided by means of the roller retainer <b>412</b> and circulated in each of the circulation passages.</p>
    <p>The outer tube <b>404</b> is composed of a tubular main body <b>413</b> having the roller running counter-grooves <b>408</b>, <b>408</b>; <b>408</b>, <b>408</b>; <b>408</b>, <b>408</b>, three resin-formed bodies <b>420</b>, <b>420</b>, <b>420</b> for forming the ball circulation passage, which are to be inserted in the main body <b>413</b>, and a pair of side cover plates <b>440</b>, <b>440</b> secured on the both ends of the main body <b>413</b> after the insertion of the resin-formed bodies <b>420</b>, <b>420</b>, <b>420</b> in the main body <b>413</b>.</p>
    <p>In the fourth embodiment, the six circulation passages are formed by the three resin-formed bodies <b>420</b>, <b>420</b>, <b>420</b> as in the third embodiment.</p>
    <p>Each of the resin-formed bodies <b>420</b> for forming the ball circulation passage has a pair of the roller passage forming portions <b>421</b>, <b>421</b> extending along the longitudinal side edges of the roller running counter-groove <b>408</b>, a pair of direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>422</b>, <b>422</b> provided on the both ends of the main body <b>413</b>, and resin pipes <b>423</b> as a returning passage forming portion, which are inserted in through-holes formed in the main body <b>413</b>.</p>
    <p>The roller passage forming portions <b>421</b>, <b>421</b> are provided with guide grooves for guiding the both side edges of the belt portion <b>412</b> <i>b </i>of the roller retainer <b>412</b> in a loaded area. The guide grooves can prevent the roller retainer <b>412</b> not only from being swung during run of the roller, but also from being sagged by engaging the side edges of the belt portion <b>412</b> <i>b </i>with the guide groove <b>421</b> <i>a</i>, when the outer tube <b>404</b> is removed from the spline shaft <b>402</b>. The rollers <b>403</b> are supported by the roller retainer <b>412</b>. More specifically, the roller retainer <b>412</b> is supported by a jaw portion of the guide groove <b>421</b> <i>a</i>, with the result that the rollers <b>403</b> are kept in its proper position so as not to come off the outer tube <b>404</b>.</p>
    <p>Guide grooves <b>409</b> <i>c</i>, <b>410</b> <i>c </i>are also formed in the roller returning passage <b>409</b> and the direction changing passage <b>410</b> as non-loaded areas, in order to guide the side edges of the belt portion <b>412</b> <i>b</i>. The guide grooves <b>409</b> <i>c</i>, <b>410</b> <i>c </i>are connected to the above-mentioned guide groove <b>421</b> <i>a </i>in the loaded area so as to form an endless groove on the entire periphery.</p>
    <p>When the roller retainer <b>412</b> is not used, the guide grooves <b>421</b> <i>a</i>, <b>410</b> <i>a</i>, <b>409</b> <i>a </i>are not needed, and the jaw portions as shown in FIG. <b>20</b>(<i>h</i>) for supporting the ends of the roller are formed on the roller passage forming portions <b>421</b>.</p>
    <p>In each of the resin-formed bodies <b>420</b> for forming the roller circulation passage, at least one of four connecting portions of the roller passage forming portions <b>421</b>, <b>421</b> with the pair of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>422</b>, <b>422</b> are integrally connected with each other. The resin-formed body <b>420</b> is divided at the other portions into separate parts so as to be able to be inserted in the main body <b>413</b>.</p>
    <p>The fundamental embodiment of the resin-formed body for forming the roller circulation passage, which is to be used for the spline unit is described in detail in the third embodiment. The structure of the resin-formed body for forming the roller circulation passage is described in detail in the second embodiment. Here, only the fundamental divisional pattern of the resin-formed body <b>420</b> for forming the roller circulation passage will be briefly described below with reference to FIG. <b>39</b>.</p>
    <p>In FIG. <b>39</b>(<i>a</i>), the both ends of the four sets of roller passage forming portions <b>421</b>, <b>421</b> are integrally connected with the respective one end of the pair of direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>422</b>, <b>422</b> to form a single resin frame <b>424</b>, and the both ends of each of the returning passage forming portions <b>423</b> are not connected with the other end of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>422</b> so that these parts can be assembled into the main body <b>413</b>.</p>
    <p>In FIG. <b>39</b>(<i>b</i>), the resin-formed body <b>420</b> for forming the roller circulation passage is composed of the first resin-formed frame <b>420</b>A, which is obtained by integrally connecting both of the roller passage forming portions <b>421</b>, <b>421</b> and the resin pipes <b>423</b> as a returning passage forming portion at their ends with the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>422</b>A for one side, and the second resin-formed frame <b>420</b>B, which is provided with the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>422</b>B for the other side and separately formed from the first resin-formed frame <b>420</b>A.</p>

    <p>In FIGS. <b>39</b>(<i>a</i>) to <b>29</b>(<i>e</i>), the resin-formed frames are connected with each other by means of the conventional joint method such as a faucet joint, which uses engagement of the engaging projection with the recess.</p>
    <heading>FIFTH EMBODIMENT</heading> <p>FIGS. 40 to <b>44</b> show a linear motion guiding apparatus of the fifth embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p>The linear motion guiding apparatus <b>501</b> is provided with a guide rail <b>502</b> as a guide member, which extends linearly, and a movable block <b>504</b> as a movable member, which is arranged so as to be movable along the guide rail <b>502</b> through a large number of balls <b>503</b> as rolling members.</p>
    <p>The guide rail <b>502</b> is formed into a long bar shape having a rectangular cross-section. Two ball running grooves <b>505</b>, <b>505</b> as a rolling member running track are formed on each of the right and left-hand side surfaces of the guide rail <b>502</b>, so as to provide a total number of grooves <b>505</b> of four. The guide rail <b>502</b> has on each of its side surfaces a projection <b>502</b> <i>a</i>, on the upper and lower positions of which the ball running grooves <b>505</b>, <b>505</b> are arranged.</p>
    <p>The movable block <b>504</b> is formed as a block body having an inverse U-shaped cross-section, with its opening end being directed downwardly. The block body is provided with a horizontal portion <b>506</b>, which faces the upper surface of the guide rail <b>502</b> and with a pair of wing portions <b>507</b>, <b>507</b>, which extend downwardly from the right and left ends of the horizontal portion <b>506</b> and face the right and left-hand side surfaces of the guide rail <b>502</b>, respectively. Each of the wing portions <b>507</b>, <b>507</b> has on its inner surface two ball running counter-grooves <b>508</b>, <b>508</b> as a rolling member running counter-track, which correspond to the ball running grooves <b>505</b>, <b>505</b> formed on the right and left-hand side surfaces of the guide rail <b>502</b>.</p>
    <p>Each of the right and left-hand wing portions <b>507</b>, <b>507</b> of the movable block <b>504</b> has two ball returning passage forming portions <b>509</b>, <b>509</b> formed therein, which extend in parallel with the ball running counter-grooves <b>508</b>, <b>508</b>. At both the longitudinal ends of each of the wing portions <b>507</b>, <b>507</b>, there are arranged direction changing passages <b>510</b>, <b>510</b>; <b>510</b>, <b>510</b> for connecting the ends of the ball running counter-grooves <b>508</b>, <b>508</b>; <b>508</b>, <b>508</b> with the ends of the ball returning passage <b>509</b>, <b>509</b>; <b>509</b>, <b>509</b>. In summary, each of the wing portions <b>507</b>, <b>507</b> of the movable block <b>504</b> has two endless circulation passages, in which the balls <b>503</b> are circulated, so as to provide the total number of passage of four.</p>
    <p>In each of the four endless circulation passages in this embodiment, the balls <b>503</b> are retained in the form of train by means a ball retainer <b>512</b> as a rolling member retainer so that the balls <b>503</b> can be circulated while being guided by the ball retainer <b>512</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIGS. <b>44</b>(<i>c</i>) to <b>44</b>(<i>e</i>), the ball retainer <b>512</b> comprises a flexible belt portion <b>512</b> <i>b</i>, which is provided with ball holes <b>512</b> <i>a </i>for respectively receiving the balls <b>503</b>, and spacing portions <b>512</b> <i>c </i>provided between the adjacent two balls <b>503</b>, <b>503</b>. The belt portion <b>512</b> <i>b </i>has a width longer than the diameter of the ball <b>503</b> so that the both side edges of the belt portion <b>512</b> <i>b </i>extend outwardly from the ball <b>503</b>.</p>
    <p>The spacing portion <b>512</b> <i>c </i>is provided with a ball supporting spherical recess <b>512</b> <i>d </i>corresponding to the spherical surface of the ball <b>503</b>. The ball <b>503</b> is supported on its both sides by a pair of supporting spherical recesses <b>512</b> <i>d </i>so as to prevent the ball <b>503</b> from coming off the belt portion <b>512</b> <i>b</i>. In this embodiment, the one end of the belt portion <b>512</b> <i>b </i>is not connected to the other end thereof, thus forming a strip-shaped belt having the both ends. The one end of the belt portion <b>512</b> <i>b </i>may be connected to the other end thereof so as to form an endless belt.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 41, the movable block <b>504</b> is composed of a block body <b>513</b> having ball running counter-grooves <b>508</b>, <b>508</b>, <b>508</b>, <b>508</b>, a pair of right and left-hand resin-formed bodies <b>520</b>, <b>520</b> for forming ball circulation passages, which is inserted in the block body <b>513</b>, and a pair of side cover plates <b>540</b> (only one cover plate <b>540</b> is illustrated) secured to the both end surfaces of the block body <b>13</b>, in which the resin-formed bodied <b>520</b>, <b>520</b> are inserted.</p>
    <p>Each of the right and left-hand resin-formed bodies <b>520</b>, <b>520</b> for forming the ball circulation passage forms two endless circulation passages.</p>
    <p>The right and left-hand resin-formed bodies <b>520</b>, <b>520</b> have the symmetrical shape. One of them will be described below and the description of other thereof will be omitted.</p>
    <p>More specifically, the resin-formed body <b>520</b> for forming the ball circulation passage is composed of a resin frame <b>524</b> obtained by integrally forming the ball passage forming portions <b>521</b>, <b>521</b> extending along both longitudinal sides of the ball running counter-groove <b>508</b> with the pair of direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>522</b>, <b>522</b> (see FIG. <b>42</b>); and a pair of resin pipes <b>523</b>, <b>523</b> as a returning passage forming portion, which are to be inserted in through-holes <b>514</b>, <b>514</b> formed in the block body <b>513</b> (see FIG. <b>43</b>). The ball passage forming portions <b>521</b>, <b>521</b> are integrally formed with the pair of direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>522</b>, <b>522</b> to form the resin frame <b>524</b> as an integral body, and the pair of resin pipes <b>523</b>, <b>523</b> are separately formed from such an integral body, so that these parts can be assembled into the block body <b>513</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 42, the ball passage forming portions <b>521</b>, <b>521</b> are provided with guide grooves for guiding the both side edges of the belt portion <b>512</b> <i>b </i>of the ball retainer <b>512</b> in a loaded area. The guide grooves can prevent the ball retainer <b>512</b> not only from being swung during run of the ball, but also from being sagged by engaging the side edges of the belt portion <b>512</b> <i>b </i>with the guide groove <b>521</b> <i>a</i>, when the movable block <b>504</b> is removed from the guide rail <b>502</b>. The balls <b>503</b> are supported by the ball retainer <b>512</b>. More specifically, the ball retainer <b>512</b> is supported by a jaw portion of the guide groove <b>521</b> <i>a</i>, with the result that the balls <b>503</b> are kept in its proper position so as not to come off the movable block <b>504</b>.</p>
    <p>The distance between the pair of ball passage forming portions <b>521</b>, <b>521</b> arranged in parallel with each other on the both longitudinal sides of the ball running counter-groove <b>508</b> is slightly smaller than the diameter of the ball <b>503</b>. In such a construction, it is possible to prevent the balls <b>503</b> from coming off the ball passage forming portions <b>521</b>, <b>521</b> even when the ball retainer <b>512</b> is not used.</p>
    <p>Guide grooves <b>509</b> <i>c</i>, <b>510</b> <i>c </i>are also formed, as shown in FIGS. <b>44</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>44</b>(<i>b</i>), in the ball returning passage <b>509</b>, <b>509</b> and the direction changing passage <b>510</b>, <b>510</b> as non-loaded areas, in order to guide the side edges of the belt portion <b>512</b> <i>b</i>. The guide grooves <b>509</b> <i>c</i>, <b>510</b> <i>c </i>are connected to the above-mentioned guide groove <b>521</b> <i>a </i>in the loaded area so as to form an endless groove on the entire periphery.</p>
    <p>The ball passage forming portions <b>521</b>, <b>521</b>; <b>521</b>, <b>521</b> are composed, as shown in FIG. <b>42</b>(<i>a</i>), of the first connecting plate portion <b>525</b> extending longitudinally along the corner between the horizontal portion <b>506</b> and the wing portion <b>507</b> of the block body <b>513</b> in the longitudinal direction of the block body <b>513</b>; the second connecting plate portion <b>526</b> extending longitudinally between the ball running counter-grooves <b>508</b>, <b>508</b> on the inner surface of each of the wing portions <b>507</b> of the block body <b>513</b>; and a pair of third connecting plate portions <b>527</b> extending along the under surface of the wing portion <b>507</b> of the block body <b>513</b> in the longitudinal direction thereof.</p>
    <p>The upper edge of the first connecting plate portion <b>525</b> and the lower edge of the second connecting plate portion <b>526</b>, which face to each other, are placed on the opposite longitudinal sides of the upper ball running counter-groove <b>508</b> provided in the wing portion <b>507</b>, so as to form the ball passage forming portions <b>521</b>, <b>521</b>. The lower edge of the second connecting plate portion <b>526</b> and the upper edge of the third connecting plate portion <b>527</b>, which face to each other, are placed on the opposite longitudinal sides of the lower ball running counter-groove <b>508</b> provided in the wing portion <b>507</b>, so as to form the ball passage forming portions <b>521</b>, <b>521</b>.</p>

    <p>The inner peripheral side-half pipe member <b>523</b> <i>a </i>has a groove portion <b>509</b> <i>a </i>having a semi-circular cross section, and side edge portions <b>523</b> <i>c </i>extending longitudinally along the groove portion <b>509</b> <i>a</i>, as shown in FIGS. <b>43</b>(<i>c</i>) and <b>43</b>(<i>d</i>). The outer peripheral side-half pipe member <b>523</b> <i>b </i>is formed into a linear member having the same circular cross section as the outer guide groove <b>510</b> <i>b </i>for the direction changing passage, which is formed on the side cover plate <b>540</b>. The outer peripheral side-half pipe member <b>523</b> <i>b </i>has a groove portion <b>509</b> <i>b</i>, which is continuously connected to the outer guide groove <b>510</b> <i>b</i>, and side edge portions <b>523</b> <i>d </i>extending longitudinally along the groove portion <b>509</b> <i>b</i>. The side edge portions <b>523</b> <i>d </i>is provided on its outer edges with projections <b>523</b> <i>e</i>, which are to be brought into contact with the outer edges of the side edge portions <b>523</b> <i>c </i>of the inner peripheral side-half pipe member <b>523</b> <i>a </i>to form the retainer-guide groove <b>509</b> <i>c </i>for the ball retainer <b>512</b>.</p>
    <p>The inner peripheral, side-half pipe member <b>523</b> <i>a </i>of the resin pipe <b>523</b> has the same length of the block body <b>513</b>. The inner peripheral side-half pipe member <b>523</b> <i>a </i>is positioned so as to be brought into contact with the back surface of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>522</b>.</p>
    <p>The outer peripheral side-half pipe member <b>523</b> <i>b </i>of the resin pipe <b>523</b> has on the other hand a longer length than the block body <b>513</b> by a length corresponding to the thickness of the thin sheet portion <b>529</b>. The outer peripheral side-half pipe members <b>523</b> <i>b </i>are inserted in the inserting holes <b>534</b>. Longitudinal positional determination of the outer peripheral side-half pipe member <b>523</b> <i>b </i>is made by bringing the both ends of the outer peripheral side-half pipe member <b>523</b> <i>b </i>inserted in the inserting holes <b>534</b> into contact with the peripheral edge of the end portion of the outer guide grooves <b>510</b> <i>b </i>for the direction changing passage, which are formed on the side cover plate <b>540</b>. The projections <b>523</b> <i>e </i>formed on the both side edges of the outer peripheral side-half pipe member <b>523</b> <i>b </i>come into contact with the outer edges of the cylindrical flange portions <b>533</b> formed on the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>522</b> to form a part of the guide groove <b>510</b> <i>c</i>, and the outer peripheral side-half pipe member <b>523</b> <i>b </i>and the inner peripheral side-half pipe member <b>523</b> <i>a </i>are restricted to be turned in the inserting hole <b>514</b>.</p>
    <p>The resin pipes <b>523</b> and the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>522</b> are accurately positioned through the inserting holes <b>534</b> formed on the thin sheet portion <b>529</b> and a proper assembling is carried out in this manner.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIGS. <b>44</b>(<i>f</i>) and <b>44</b>(<i>g</i>), the side cover plate <b>540</b> is provided with an inserting recess portion <b>540</b> <i>a</i>, in which the thin sheet portion <b>529</b> is inserted, recess portions <b>541</b> having the outer guide grooves <b>510</b> <i>b </i>for the direction changing passage, into which portions the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>522</b> are fitted, and screw-fixing portions for securing the side cover plate <b>540</b> to the block body <b>513</b>. In the screw-fixing portions, the side cover plate <b>540</b> is fixed to the block body <b>513</b> by inserting bolts (not shown) into holes <b>543</b> formed on the side cover plate <b>540</b> and engaging the bolts with screwed holes <b>545</b> formed on the end surface of the block body <b>513</b>. The holes <b>543</b> are located at four positions, i.e., the position corresponding to the thin sheet portion <b>529</b> between the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>522</b>, <b>522</b> of each of the resin-formed bodies <b>520</b>, <b>520</b>, and the positions in the vicinity of the thin sheet portions <b>529</b>, <b>529</b> on the horizontal portion <b>506</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. <b>44</b>(<i>g</i>), the outer guide groove <b>510</b> <i>b </i>for the direction changing passage in the: recess portion <b>541</b> has on its side edges larger-diameter arcuate recesses: <b>546</b>, which form the retainer-guide groove <b>510</b> <i>c </i>in cooperation with the cylindrical flange portions <b>533</b> of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>522</b> as shown in FIG. <b>44</b>(<i>f</i>), and a smaller-diameter arcuate recesses <b>547</b>, in which the cylindrical flange portions <b>533</b> are inserted. The direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>522</b> provided with the inner guide groove <b>510</b> <i>a </i>for the direction changing passage is fitted into the recess portion <b>541</b> of the side cover plate <b>540</b>, and the thin sheet portion <b>529</b> is received in the inserting recess portion <b>540</b> <i>a </i>of the side cover plate <b>540</b>. The thin sheet portion <b>529</b> is held between the side cover plate <b>540</b> and the end surface of the block body <b>513</b> through a clamping force so as to be firmly fixed therebetween.</p>
    <p>The direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>522</b> and the ball passage forming portion <b>521</b> are connected through the thin sheet portion <b>529</b>, thus making it possible to maintain an accurate positional relationship of the end of the inner guide groove <b>510</b> <i>a </i>for the direction changing passage formed in the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>522</b> relative to the ball passage forming portions <b>521</b>, <b>521</b>, as well as an accurate positional relationship of the inner guide groove <b>510</b> <i>a </i>for the direction changing passage relative to the ball returning passage <b>509</b>.</p>
    <p>The thin sheet portion <b>529</b> located in the vicinity of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>522</b> is uniformly urged against the flat end surface of the block body <b>513</b> through a clamping force applied to the side cover plate <b>540</b> (see FIG. <b>44</b>). Even when the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>522</b> is not located in a correct position, the thin sheet portion <b>529</b> changes its shape on the end surface of the block body <b>513</b>, thus permitting the correct positioning of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>522</b>. The thin sheet portion <b>529</b> is firmly clamped and fixed through a clamping force, which is applied to the side cover plate <b>540</b>, and functional force caused by such a clamping step may prevent an unfavorable movement of the inner guide groove <b>510</b> <i>a </i>for the direction changing passage.</p>
    <p>The side cover plate <b>540</b> is secured to the block body <b>513</b> so that the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>522</b> assembled to the block body <b>513</b> is fitted into the recess portion <b>541</b> of the side cover plate <b>40</b>. Such a fitting step permits to make an accurate positioning of the side cover plate <b>540</b> relative to the block body <b>513</b>.</p>
    <p>Now, description will be given of assembling steps for the above-mentioned resin-formed bodies <b>520</b> for forming the ball circulation passage.</p>
    <p>First, the inner peripheral side-half pipe member <b>523</b> <i>a </i>of the resin pipe <b>523</b> is inserted in the through-hole <b>514</b> of the wing portion <b>507</b> of the block body <b>513</b>.</p>
    <p>Then, the resin frame <b>524</b> obtained by integral forming is inserted in the recess of the block body <b>513</b>, while causing the thin sheet portions <b>529</b> at the both ends of the resin frame <b>524</b> to slide on the respective end surfaces of the wing portion <b>507</b> of the block body <b>513</b>. The first connecting plate portion <b>525</b> of the resin frame <b>524</b> comes into contact with the corner portion between the horizontal portion <b>506</b> and the wing portion <b>507</b>, thus making positional determination in the vertical direction of the resin frame <b>524</b>. The second connecting plate portion <b>526</b> and the third connecting plate portion <b>527</b> of the resin frame <b>524</b> come into contact with the respective inner surfaces of the wing portions <b>507</b> of the block body <b>513</b>, thus making positional determination of the ball passage forming portions <b>521</b>, <b>521</b> and the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portions <b>522</b>, <b>522</b>. At this time, the inserting holes <b>534</b>, <b>534</b> of the thin sheet portion <b>529</b> are aligned with the through-holes <b>514</b>, <b>514</b> of the block body <b>513</b>.</p>
    <p>Then, the outer peripheral side-half pipe members <b>523</b> <i>b</i>, <b>523</b> <i>b </i>are inserted in the through-holes <b>514</b>, <b>514</b> from the inserting holes <b>534</b>, <b>534</b>, thus completing the assembling step of one of the resin-formed bodies <b>520</b>, <b>520</b> for forming the ball circulation passage.</p>
    <p>The assembling step, of the other of the resin-formed bodies <b>520</b>, <b>520</b> is carried out in the same manner.</p>
    <p>Then, the one side cover plate <b>540</b> is secured to the one end surface of the block body <b>513</b> by a clamping step, the ball retainer <b>512</b> holding the balls is inserted, and the other side cover plate <b>540</b> is secured to the other end surface of the block body <b>513</b> by the same clamping step, thus completing the assembling step of the movable block <b>504</b>.</p>
    <p>According to the present invention, the resin-formed bodies <b>520</b>, <b>520</b> for forming the ball circulation passage are separately formed from the block body <b>513</b>. Even when the movable block <b>504</b> has a larger size, there is no restriction of flow of molten resin by the block body <b>513</b>, unlike the case where the block body <b>513</b> is integrally formed with the resin-formed bodies <b>520</b>, <b>520</b>. Increase in number of gates formed on a die may ensure proper run of the molten resin, thus improving the formability. Especially the ball passage forming portions <b>521</b>, <b>521</b> located at the opposite longitudinal sides of the ball running groove <b>508</b> are thin, with the result that molten resin may not reach every part of the space for forming the ball passage forming portions <b>521</b>, <b>521</b>. It is therefore effective to form the resin-formed bodies <b>520</b>, <b>520</b> separately from the block body <b>513</b> in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p>In addition, since there are formed the right and left-hand resin-formed bodies <b>520</b>, <b>520</b> for forming the ball circulation passage, each of which has two endless circulation passages, a proper run of molten resin is ensured even when the movable block <b>513</b> has a larger width.</p>
    <p>The continuous circulation passage is formed by the resin-formed body <b>520</b>, and it is therefore possible to make positional determination of the inner guide groove <b>510</b> <i>a </i>for the direction changing passage relative to the ball passage forming portions <b>5211</b>, <b>521</b>, as well as positional determination of the inner guide groove <b>510</b> <i>a </i>for the direction changing passage relative to the ball returning passage <b>509</b>, thus ensuring continuity of the circulation passage so as to make smooth circulation of the balls <b>503</b>.</p>
    <p>When the proper positional relationship of the inner guide groove <b>510</b> <i>a </i>for the direction changing passage relative to the ball passage forming portions <b>521</b>, <b>521</b>, is maintained, the ball passage forming portions <b>521</b>, <b>521</b> are located at the longitudinal both sides of the ball running groove <b>508</b> so as to be aligned with the ends of the inner guide groove <b>510</b> <i>a </i>for the direction changing passage.</p>
    <p>When the proper positional relationship of the inner guide groove <b>510</b> <i>a </i>for the direction changing passage relative to the ball returning passage <b>509</b> is maintained, the inner guide groove <b>510</b> <i>a </i>for the direction changing passage can be aligned with the inner groove <b>523</b> <i>a </i>of the ball returning passage <b>509</b>.</p>
    <p>The connecting portion of the ball passage forming portions <b>521</b>, <b>521</b> and the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion <b>522</b> is obtained by integral forming, thus permitting omission of an assembling step of the connecting portion. Although the running direction of the balls <b>503</b> is changed in such a connecting portion, the above-mentioned integral structure may ensure continuity of the circulation passage, without being affected by assembling accuracy. It is therefore possible to make smooth run of the balls <b>503</b> from the ball running passage between the ball running groove <b>505</b> and the ball running counter-groove <b>508</b> to the direction changing passage <b>510</b>, as well as from the direction changing passage <b>510</b> to the ball returning passage <b>509</b>.</p>
    <p>According to the present invention as described in detail, since the resin-formed body for forming the rolling member circulation passage is separately formed from the block body, even when the movable block has a larger size, increase in number of gates formed on a die may ensure proper run of the molten resin, thus improving the formability. It is therefore effective to form the resin-formed body separately from the block body in accordance with the present invention, taking into consideration the fact that the rolling member passage forming portions located at the opposite longitudinal sides of the rolling member running track are thin, with the result that molten resin may not reach every part of the space for forming the rolling member passage forming portions.</p>
    <p>The continuous circulation passage is formed by the resin-formed body, and it is therefore possible to make positional determination of the inner guide groove for the direction changing passage relative to the rolling member passage forming portions, as well as positional determination of the inner guide groove for the direction changing passage relative to the rolling member returning passage, thus ensuring continuity of the circulation passage so as to make smooth circulation of the rolling members.</p>
    <p>When the connecting portion of the rolling member passage forming portions and the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion or the connecting portion of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion and the returning passage forming portion, in which portion the running direction of the rolling members is changed is obtained by integral forming, it is possible to omit an assembling step of the connecting portion and to ensure continuity of the circulation passage, without being affected by assembling accuracy.</p>
    <p>The integral formation of the connecting portion of the rolling member passage forming portion with the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion may cause the smooth running of the rolling members between the rolling member running track in the loaded area and the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion, even when the returning passage forming portion formed of resin is not used.</p>
    <p>When the rolling member retainer is used, it is possible to maintain a proper continuity on the entire periphery of the circulation passage in the retainer guide portion for guiding the rolling member retainer.</p>
    <p>The thin retainer guide portion is formed without insertion of the body of the movable member in a die, and position of gates in the die can freely be determined without being restricted by the body of the movable member, with the result that molten resin can reach, during formation of the guide portion, the entire space therefor, which is formed in the die.</p>
    <p>In addition, the formation of the right and left-hand resin-formed bodies for forming the rolling member circulation passage, each of which has two endless circulation passages may ensure a proper run of molten resin even when the body of the movable member has a larger width.</p>
    <p>The connection of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion with the rolling member passage forming portion through the thin sheet portion makes it possible to maintain, through deformation of the thin sheet portion, a proper positional relationship between the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion and the rolling member passage forming portion or a proper positional relationship between the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion and the rolling member returning passage forming portion, thus making an accurate positional determination of the end of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion relative to the rolling member returning passage forming portion as well as an accurate positional determination of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion relative to the rolling member returning passage forming portion.</p>
    <p>The thin sheet portion is urged against the flat end face of the body of the movable member by a clamping force, which is applied to the side cover plate. It is therefore possible to correct the position of the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion through deformation of the thin sheet portion, even when the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion is not correctly positioned relative to the end face of the body of the movable member.</p>
    <p>In addition, the thin sheet portion can firmly be secured between the side cover plate and the body of the movable member by the clamping force, which is applied to the side cover plate, and it is therefore possible to prevent the direction changing passage-inner guide forming portion from being incorrectly placed.</p>
