    <p num="p-0002">This application is a divisional of Ser. No. 10/189,935, Jul. 3, 2002 U.S. Pat. No. 6,686,228 which is a con of Ser. No. 09/535,835, Mar. 28, 2000, U.S. Pat. No. 6,475,836.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="p-0004">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device having a circuit in which a thin film transistor (hereinafter referred to as TFT) is formed on a substrate having an insulating surface, and to a manufacturing method thereof. More particularly, the present invention relates to an electro-optical device typically known as a liquid crystal display device provided with an excellent-shaped contact hole, and to electronic equipment with an electro-optical device. Moreover, the semiconductor device according to the present invention refers to all equipment utilizing the semiconductor characteristics for functioning. The above electro-optical device and the electronic equipment with an electro-optical device are also included in semiconductor devices.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="p-0006">The development of a semiconductor device having a large-area integrated circuit formed by the TFT (thin film transistor) on its insulating surface is under progression. AN active matrix liquid crystal display device, an EL display device, a contact-type image sensor, and the like are known as representative examples.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">The characteristics of the TFT are deteriorated and reliability is lowered when organic resin film is directly formed on the TFT provided on the insulating surface. To solve those problems, conventionally, a laminated organic resin film is formed on the TFT after the formation of an inorganic insulating film (also called passivation film).</p>
    <p num="p-0008">The TFT is normally connected to wirings through a contact hole. Therefore, when the above inorganic insulating film is provided on the TFT, it is necessary to form a contact hole for connecting to the upper layer wiring in the inorganic insulating film and the organic resin film which covers a TFT gate electrode, a source electrode, or a drain electrode. For instance, the contact hole is formed for connecting a drain electrode of a pixel TFT with a pixel electrode in an active matrix liquid crystal display using TFT.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">A conventional manufacturing process will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A through D</figref>. Shown here is an example of an active matrix liquid crystal display applied to this process. Although the pixel TFT is not shown for simplification, a first conductive film <b>11</b> is identical with a drain electrode of a pixel TFT or electrically connected thereto. Also not shown is that there is a single layer or a multiple layer of insulating film between a substrate <b>10</b> and the first conductive film <b>11</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">Shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> is a state where the first conductive film <b>11</b> identical with the drain electrode of a pixel TFT or electrically connected thereto is formed on the substrate <b>10</b> on which the pixel TFT is formed. An inorganic insulating film <b>12</b> and an organic resin film <b>13</b> formed in laminations are formed on top of the first conductive film <b>11</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">And shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref> is a state where the first patterning is performed by using a resist mask <b>14</b> by way of photolithography, and a first contact hole is opened only in the organic resin film <b>13</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">Subsequently, a second patterning is performed by using a resist mask <b>15</b> after removing the resist mask <b>14</b>, and a second contact hole is opened only in the inorganic insulating film <b>12</b>. This state is shown in FIG. <b>17</b>C. Since the second contact hole is formed in the bottom portion of the first contact hole, the diameter of its opening is smaller than that of the first contact hole.</p>
    <p num="p-0013">Shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17D</figref> next is a state where a pixel electrode <b>16</b>, made of transparent conductive film, is formed after removing the resist mask <b>15</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0014">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17D</figref>, in this way there is a step in the shape of the contact hole because it has been formed after the first and second patterning processes.</p>
    <p num="p-0015">Additionally, besides the above conventional manufacturing method, another method is to perform patterning right after forming the inorganic insulating film, then form the organic resin film and perform patterning again to form a contact hole. Two patterning processes were also necessary even in this method.</p>
    <p num="p-0016">Since the number of processes and masks has increased due to two patterning (organic resin film patterning and inorganic insulating film patterning) processes in the conventional method, this led to an increase in costs.</p>
    <p num="p-0017">In the two patterning processes, each method uses different photo mask, and therefore poor contact occurred when the masks had not been overlapped in precision. Also, in the example of the conventional process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, fining of the contact hole is difficult. That is because considering the margin when overlapping, the opening diameter of the second contact hole that was opened in the second patterning is 1.5 to 2 times bigger than the opening diameter of the first contact hole opened in the first patterning process.</p>
    <p num="p-0018">Furthermore, the shape of a conventional contact hole (of which an example is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17D</figref>) is a complicated shape formed by overlapping two contact holes with different opening diameter. Thus, poor coverage has occurred on a second conductive film formed later.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0019">A technique of the present invention is for solving the above problems, and therefore it is an object of the present invention to provide a manufacturing method of a semiconductor device whereby the number of processes is decreased due to simultaneously forming a contact hole in a lamination film (inorganic insulating film and organic resin film) of different material and film thickness by conducting etching once.</p>
    <p num="p-0020">It is another object of the present invention to improve operating efficiency and reliability of a semiconductor device by providing a contact hole that is uniform in shape, and moreover an appropriate one.</p>
    <p num="p-0021">It is still another further object of the present invention to form a pixel electrode of good coverage and to provide a structure for improving the yield of an active matrix type liquid crystal display device.</p>
    <p num="p-0022">In order to solve the above problems, the present invention provides a semiconductor device comprising: a first conductive film formed on an insulating substrate; an inorganic insulating film covering said first conductive film; an organic resin film covering said inorganic insulating film; a contact hole that goes through said inorganic insulating film and said organic resin film; and a second conductive film formed on said organic resin film which is connected to said first conductive film at a bottom surface of said contact hole.</p>
    <p num="p-0023">Further, according to the above structure, said contact hole is formed by performing one etching.</p>
    <p num="p-0024">Still further, according to each structure of the above, an edge portion of an inorganic insulating film that comes in contact with a bottom surface of said contact hole is taper like having an angle range of 30° to 80° from a horizontal surface.</p>
    <p num="p-0025">Further, according to each structure of the above, an edge portion of an organic resin film that comes in contact with said inorganic insulating film has an angle range of 50° to 90° from a horizontal surface.</p>
    <p num="p-0026">Still further, according to each structure of the above, a TFT is electrically connected to said first conductive film.</p>
    <p num="p-0027">Further, according to each structure of the above, said second conductive film is a pixel electrode.</p>
    <p num="p-0028">According to each structure of the above, said inorganic insulating film is a silicon nitride film or a silicon oxide nitride film.</p>
    <p num="p-0029">Moreover, in order to realize the above structure, the present invention provides a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device comprising the steps of: forming a first conductive film; forming an inorganic insulating film on said first conductive film; forming an organic resin film on said inorganic insulating film; forming a contact hole in a laminated film formed of said inorganic insulating film and said organic resin film in one process; and forming a second conductive film in said contact hole.</p>
    <p num="p-0030">Further, according to the above structure, said process of forming a contact hole is performed by dry etching employing mixed gas containing fluorine-based etchant gas and oxygen gas.</p>
    <p num="p-0031">Furthermore, according to the above structure, a selective ratio of an etching rate of said inorganic insulating film to an etching rate of said organic resin film is 1.6 to 2.9.</p>
    <p num="p-0032">Still further, according to the above structure, said inorganic insulating film is a silicon nitride film or a silicon oxide nitride film.</p>

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p num="p-0058">A description of preferred embodiments of the present invention will be given with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 7</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0059"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 1C</figref> are diagrams showing a manufacturing process of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0060">First of all, a first conductive film <b>501</b>, an inorganic insulating film <b>502</b>, and an organic resin film <b>503</b> are formed in laminations on a substrate <b>500</b>. (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>)</p>
    <p num="p-0061">After achieving the state illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a resist mask <b>504</b> is formed by way of photolithography. Then, the opening of a contact hole is formed by simultaneously etching, only once, the lamination films of the inorganic insulating film <b>502</b> and the organic resin film <b>503</b> which are formed in laminations. (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) The etching conducted here is dry etching employing mixed gas, which contains oxygen and etchant gas that is at least fluorine-based.</p>
    <p num="p-0062">The fluorine-based etchant gas as used herein indicates either fluorine or gas that partially contains fluorine. It also indicates, for example, simple substance gas such as F<sub>2</sub>, BF<sub>3</sub>, SiF<sub>4</sub>, HF, CF<sub>4</sub>, and the like or mixed gas. Moreover, it indicates gas obtained from the simple substance gas or mixed gas diluted by gases that do not contain chlorine (for example, H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, etc.</p>
    <p num="p-0063">Subsequently, a second conductive film <b>505</b> is formed after the resist mask <b>504</b> is removed and then the first conductive film <b>501</b> and the second conductive film <b>505</b> are electrically connected. (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>)</p>
    <p num="p-0064">The above is a manufacturing process of the present invention. A number of experiments has been tested on the process illustrated in FIG. <b>1</b>B.</p>
    <p num="p-0065">In order to obtain the state illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a Ti film as the first conductive film <b>501</b> to be a connection layer is formed by sputtering and a 330 nm of silicon oxide nitride film (represented as SiO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>) is formed by using SiH<sub>4</sub>/NH<sub>3</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>O/Ar or SiH<sub>4</sub>/NH<sub>3</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>O/Ar as the inorganic insulating film <b>502</b> on the substrate <b>500</b>. Next, a 1 μm of acrylic resin film as the organic resin film <b>503</b> is formed in lamination by coating thereon.</p>
    <p num="p-0066">The resist mask <b>504</b> is then formed by photolithography. In this process, dry etching is performed by employing mixed gas which at least contains oxygen and CF<sub>4</sub>.</p>
    <p num="h-0005">(Experiment 1)</p>
    <p num="p-0067">An experiment was conducted by first changing the flow rate ratio of CF<sub>4 </sub>to oxygen in dry etching. Setting 400 W (2.56 W/cm<sup>2</sup>) to an RF electric power, 0.4 Torr to a gas pressure, 35 sccm to an He flow rate, and 40 sccm/60 sccm, 45 sccm/55 sccm, 50 sccm/50 sccm, 55 sccm/45 sccm, and 60 sccm/40 sccm to a CF<sub>4 </sub>flow rate/oxygen flow rate, respectively, the experiment was conducted.</p>
    <p num="p-0068">The result of this experiment is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. When the flow rate ratio of CF<sub>4 </sub>is increased, the etching rate of acrylic resin film with respect to the etching gas decreases whereas the etching rate of silicon oxide nitride film with respect to etching gas increases as shown in FIG. <b>2</b>A. The graph of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrating a selective ratio (etching rate of acrylic resin film/etching rate of silicon oxide nitride film, etching rate of silicon oxide nitride film/etching rate of Ti film) is based on FIG. <b>2</b>A.</p>
    <p num="p-0069">Furthermore, photographic views that correspond to the respective flow rate conditions are illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0070">Among the photographic views of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, a contact hole that is at its best shape is when the flow rate condition of CF<sub>4 </sub>is 45 sccm to 55 sccm, preferably 50 sccm (FIG. <b>3</b>C). An edge portion of the inorganic insulating film that is in contact with the bottom surface of the contact hole in this state is taper like having an angle of 70° from the horizontal surface. And also from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, when the contact hole is most excellently-shaped, the selection ratio is 1.6 to 2.9, preferably 1.9.</p>
    <p num="p-0071">An experiment using an organic resin film made of polyimide rather than acrylic was conducted resulting in similar results. And another experiment using a nitrogenous inorganic insulating film such as a silicon nitride film and the like rather than silicon oxide nitride film was conducted and similar results were obtained.</p>
    <p num="p-0072">The present inventor has proved from the results of the above experiments that by setting the selective ratio of dry etching (etching rate of organic resin film/etching rate of nitrogenous inorganic insulating film) from 1.6 to 2.9, preferably 1.9, the shape and the size of the contact holes to be formed even in a film of different material and film thickness can be nearly the same in both of the contact holes.</p>
    <p num="p-0073">Although the upper portion of the contact hole is slightly an overhanging shape, the coverage of the second conductive film is not influenced as shown in FIG. <b>3</b>C. The reason for the occurrence of the overhang shape is that a complete anisotropic etching was not performed although by adjusting other etching conditions (gas pressure, RF electric power, etc.), a contact hole of a much better shape can be obtained. The following is a description of experiments conducted by adjusting other etching conditions.</p>
    <p num="h-0006">(Experiment 2)</p>
    <p num="p-0074">The next experiment was conducted by setting the flow rate ratio of CF<sub>4 </sub>to oxygen in dry etching at 50/50 and changing the gas pressure. Setting 400 W (2.56 W/cm<sup>2</sup>) to the RF electric power, 35 sccm to the He flow rate, and 0.2 Torr, 0.3 Torr, 0.4 Torr, and 0.5 Torr to gas pressure, respectively, the experiment was conducted.</p>
    <p num="p-0075">The result of this experiment is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is a graph illustrating a pressure dependency of the etching rate and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> is a graph illustrating a pressure dependency of the selective ratio. By lowering the pressure in this experiment, the overhang in the top portion of the contact hole can be suppressed.</p>
    <p num="h-0007">(Experiment 3)</p>
    <p num="p-0076">Next, another experiment was conducted by setting the flow rate ratio of CF<sub>4 </sub>to oxygen in dry etching at 50/50 and changing the RF electric power. Setting 0.4 Torr to gas pressure, 35 sccm to the He flow rate, and 300 W, 400 W, 500 W, and 600 W to the RF electric power, respectively, the experiment was conducted.</p>
    <p num="p-0077">The result of this experiment is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is a graph illustrating an RF electric power dependency of the etching rate and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> is a graph illustrating an RF electric power dependency of the selective ratio. By making the RF electric power higher, the overhang in the top portion of the contact hole can be suppressed.</p>
    <p num="p-0078">By employing one condition (the flow rate ratio of CF<sub>4 </sub>to oxygen to He at 50/50/35, gas pressure at 0.3 Torr, RF electric power at 400 W) from among the preferable range that can be obtained from the results of experiments 1 to 3, the contact hole is opened taper shaped in multiple steps and a desirable shape can also be opened without an overhang occurring in the top portion of the contact hole as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> is an enlarged schematic view of the contact hole corresponding to FIG. <b>5</b>B.</p>
    <p num="p-0079">An edge portion of the inorganic insulating film that comes in contact with the bottom surface of the contact hole (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, a) can be taper like with an angle range of 30° to 80° from a horizontal surface by utilizing the present invention. Additionally, an edge portion of the organic resin film that comes in contact with the inorganic insulating film (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, b) can be angled at a range of 50° to 90° from a horizontal surface.</p>
    <p num="p-0080">Further, by employing the present invention, a fine shape contact hole with a precise diameter of 3 μm or lower, preferably 1.2 μm or lower, can be achieved.</p>
    <p num="p-0081">Furthermore, a more detailed description of embodiments of the present invention is described in the following.</p>
    <p num="h-0008">Embodiment 1</p>
    <p num="p-0082">An embodiment according to the present invention is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref> to <b>11</b>. A manufacturing method that manufactures a pixel circuit and a driving circuit, which controls the pixel circuit, on the same substrate at the same time will be explained here. However, to simplify the explanation, in the driving circuit, a CMOS circuit that is the basic circuit of a shift resist circuit, a buffer circuit, or the like, and an N channel TFT that forms a sampling circuit are shown in the diagrams.</p>
    <p num="p-0083">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, it is preferred that a quarts substrate or a silicon substrate be used as a substrate <b>101</b>. A quartz substrate is used in the present embodiment. Others such as a metal substrate or a stainless substrate with an insulating film formed thereon can also be used as a substrate. Substrates having heat resistant properties that can stand a temperature of 800° C. are demanded in the present embodiment, therefore any of the substrates that meets this demand can be used.</p>
    <p num="p-0084">A semiconductor film <b>102</b> with a film thickness of 20 to 100 nm (preferably 40 to 80 nm) containing an amorphous structure is formed by low pressure thermal CVD, plasma CVD, or sputtering on the surface in which a TFT of the substrate <b>101</b> is to be formed. Though an amorphous silicon film with a film thickness of 60 nm is formed in the present embodiment, this film thickness is not the final active layer film thickness of the TFT since there is a thermal oxide process later.</p>
    <p num="p-0085">Also, as a semiconductor film containing an amorphous structure, there are an amorphous semiconductor film and a microcrystal semiconductor film. A compound semiconductor film containing an amorphous structure such as an amorphous silicon germanium film is included also.</p>
    <p num="p-0086">Next, a mask film <b>103</b> formed of an insulating film containing silicon is formed on the amorphous silicon film <b>102</b>, and opening portions <b>104</b> <i>a </i>and <b>104</b> <i>b </i>are formed by patterning. During a crystallization process, the opening portions become a doped region for doping catalytic element to promote crystallization. (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>)</p>
    <p num="p-0087">Moreover, a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film, and a silicon oxide nitride film can be used as the insulating film containing silicon. A silicon oxide nitride film is an insulating film containing a predetermined amount of silicon, nitrogen, and oxygen and an insulating film represented by SiO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>. It is possible to manufacture a silicon nitride oxide film using SiH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, and NH<sub>3 </sub>as raw gas and better if it contains nitrogen at a concentration of 25 atomic % or higher and less than 50 atomic %.</p>
    <p num="p-0088">While performing patterning on the mask film <b>103</b>, a marker pattern is formed that will be the standard (reference) for a patterning process which will be performed later. When performing etching on the mask film <b>103</b>, the amorphous silicon film <b>102</b> will be slightly etched. However, this step can be used as the marker pattern when joining (aligning) the masks later.</p>
    <p num="p-0089">Next, a semiconductor film containing a crystal structure will be formed according to a technology disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.Hei 10-247735 (corresponding to the serial number of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/034,041). The above disclosed technology is a crystallization means using catalytic elements (one or more type of elements chosen from nickel, cobalt, germanium, tin, lead, palladium, iron, and copper) that promote crystallization of the semiconductor film.</p>
    <p num="p-0090">To be more specific, heat treatment is performed while holding a catalytic element on a surface of the semiconductor film containing amorphous structure. This is to convert the semiconductor film containing an amorphous structure to a semiconductor film containing a crystal structure. A technology disclosed in an embodiment 1 of Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Hei 7-130652 can be used as a crystallization means. Furthermore, a single crystalline semiconductor film and also a polycrystalline semiconductor film are included as a semiconductor film containing a crystal structure, though a semiconductor film containing a crystal structure formed by using the technology disclosed in the above publication has a crystal grain boundary.</p>
    <p num="p-0091">The above publication employs a spin coating method for forming a layer containing a catalytic element on a mask film. However, gaseous methods such as vapor method and sputtering can be as film forming means to form thin films containing a catalytic element.</p>
    <p num="p-0092">Depending upon the amount of hydrogen contained in the amorphous silicon film, heat treatment is performed for a duration of 1 hour preferably at 400 to 550° C. It is desired that hydrogen be sufficiently eliminated before crystallization and the preferred amount of hydrogen contained be 5 atomic % or less.</p>
    <p num="p-0093">In the crystallization process, first, heat treatment process is performed at 400 to 500° C. for a duration of 1 hour to eliminate hydrogen from the inside of the film, followed by performing heat treatment at 500 to 650° C. (preferably at 550 to 600° C.) for a duration of 6 to 16 hours (preferably for 8 to 14 hours).</p>
    <p num="p-0094">In the present embodiment, nickel is used as the catalytic element, and heat treatment is performed for a duration of 14 hours at 570° C. As a result, crystallization progresses in a direction roughly parallel with the substrate (in the direction shown by the arrows) using the opening portions <b>104</b> <i>a </i>and <b>104</b> <i>b </i>as the starting point and semiconductor films (crystalline silicon films in the present embodiment) <b>105</b> <i>a</i>-<b>105</b> <i>d </i>having a crystal structure comprising crystals whose crystal growth directions are macroscopically aligned are formed. (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>)</p>
    <p num="p-0095">Gettering process is performed next to remove the nickel used in the crystallization process from the crystalline silicon film. In the present embodiment, using the mask film <b>13</b> that was previously formed just as the mask, the process of adding an element that belongs to group <b>15</b> (phosphorous in the present embodiment) is performed and then phosphorous doped regions containing phosphorous (hereinafter referred as gettering region) <b>106</b> <i>a </i>and <b>106</b> <i>b </i>are formed at 1×10<sup>19 </sup>to 1×10<sup>20 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>of concentration on the crystalline silicon film exposed from the opening portions <b>104</b> <i>a </i>and <b>104</b> <i>b</i>. (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>)</p>
    <p num="p-0096">Next, heat treatment process is performed at 450 to 650° C. (preferably at 500 to 550° C.) in a nitrogen atmosphere for a duration of 4 to 24 hours (preferably for 6 to 12 hours). Through this heat treatment process, the nickel in the crystalline silicon film moves toward the direction of the arrow and is captured in the gettering regions <b>106</b> <i>a </i>and <b>106</b> <i>b </i>by the gettering action of phosphorus. Namely, since nickel is removed from the crystalline silicon film, the concentration of nickel in crystalline silicon films <b>107</b> <i>a </i>through <b>107</b> <i>d </i>after gettering can be reduced to 1×10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or below, preferably up to 1×10<sup>16 </sup>atms/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
    <p num="p-0097">Then after removing the mask film <b>103</b>, a protection film. <b>108</b> is formed for doping of impurities later on the crystalline films <b>107</b> <i>a </i>through <b>107</b> <i>d</i>. It is better to utilize either a silicon oxide nitride film or a silicon oxide film with a thickness of 100 to 200 nm (preferably 130 to 170 nm) as the protection film <b>108</b>. During impurity doping, this protection film <b>108</b> is for not exposing the crystalline silicon film directly to the plasma and is meant for making it possible to control subtle concentration.</p>
    <p num="p-0098">A resist mask <b>109</b> is formed on top of the protection film <b>108</b> and an impurity element that gives P-type is doped (hereinafter referred as P-type impurity element) via the protection film <b>108</b>. A representative element belonging to group <b>13</b> as a P-type impurity element, typically boron or gallium can be used. This process (called channel dope process) is to control the threshold voltage of TFT. Furthermore, diborane (B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) is not mass separated but is doped by a plasma excited ion doped method. Of course, ion implantation can be employed to perform mass separation.</p>
    <p num="p-0099">In this process, impurity regions <b>110</b> <i>a </i>and <b>110</b> <i>b </i>containing a P-type impurity element (boron in the present embodiment) are formed at a 1×10<sup>15 </sup>to 1×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>(typically 5×10<sup>16 </sup>to 5×10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>) concentration. The above concentration range of the impurity region (a region excluding phosphorus) containing P-type impurity element is defined as P-type impurity region (b) in the specifications of the present invention. (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref>)</p>
    <p num="p-0100">Next, the resist mask <b>109</b> is removed, patterning is performed on the crystalline silicon film, and island-like semiconductor layers (hereinafter referred as active layer) <b>111</b> through <b>114</b> are formed. Further, by selectively doping nickel and then performing crystallization, the active layers <b>111</b> through <b>114</b> are formed of crystalline silicon films of extremely good crystal quality. Specifically, rod like or column like crystal has crystal structures with specific directional properties.</p>
    <p num="p-0101">After crystallization, nickel is removed-or reduced by the gettering action of phosphorus, and the concentration of the catalytic element remaining in the active layers <b>111</b> through <b>114</b> is 1×10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less, preferably 1×10<sup>16 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>. (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8E</figref>)</p>
    <p num="p-0102">The active layer <b>111</b> of P channel TFT is a region that does not contain an intentionally doped impurity element and the active layers <b>112</b> through <b>114</b> of N channel TFT are P-type impurity regions (b). The present invention defines the state of all these active layers <b>111</b> through <b>114</b> as intrinsic or substantially intrinsic. That is, it can be considered that a region intentionally doped with impurities without hindering the operation of the TFT to a certain degree is a substantially intrinsic region.</p>
    <p num="p-0103">An insulating film containing silicon with a thickness of 10 to 100 nm is formed by plasma CVD or sputtering. A silicon oxide nitride film of 30 nm thickness is formed in the present embodiment. A single layer or a laminated layer of other insulating films containing silicon can be used as the insulating film containing silicon.</p>
    <p num="p-0104">Next, heat treatment process is performed under an oxidizing atmosphere (thermal oxidation process) at a temperature of 800 to 1150° C. (preferably 900to 1000° C.) for a duration of 15 minutes to 8 hours (preferably 30 minutes to 2 hours). In the present embodiment, heat treatment process is performed at 950° C. for 80 minutes under oxygen atmosphere doped with 3% by volume of hydrogen chloride. Furthermore, the boron doped in the process of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref> is activated during this thermal oxide process. (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>)</p>
    <p num="p-0105">Oxide reaction is progressing even on an interface between the insulating film containing silicon and the active layers <b>111</b> through <b>114</b> under this insulating film during the thermal oxidation process. The present invention takes this into consideration and makes adjustments so that the film thickness of a gate insulating film <b>115</b> when finally formed is 50 to 200 nm (preferably 100 to 150 nm). In the thermal oxidation process of the present embodiment, oxidation is conducted on 25 nm of the 60 nm thickness of active layers so that the film thickness of the active layers <b>111</b> through <b>114</b> becomes 35 nm. Since a thermal oxide film with a 50 nm of film thickness is added to a 30 nm thickness insulating film containing silicon, the final film thickness of the gate insulating film <b>115</b> will be 105 nm.</p>
    <p num="p-0106">Subsequently, new resist masks <b>116</b> through <b>119</b> are formed and impurity regions <b>120</b> through <b>122</b> that presents N-type are formed by adding an impurity element that gives N-type (hereinafter referred to as N-type impurity element). Further, as a representative element belonging to group <b>15</b> as an N-type impurity element, typically phosphorus or arsenic can be used. (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>)</p>
    <p num="p-0107">The impurity regions <b>120</b> through <b>122</b> are impurity regions for functioning as an LDD region later for the N channel TFT of the CMOS circuit and the sampling circuit. The N-type impurity elements in the impurity regions formed here contain 2×10<sup>16 </sup>to 5×10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>of concentration (typically 5×10<sup>17 </sup>to 5×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>). The present invention defines the impurity regions containing N-type impurity elements in the above concentration range as N-type impurity region (b).</p>
    <p num="p-0108">Here, mass separation is not performed on phosphine(PH<sub>3</sub>) and phosphorus is doped at 1×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>by plasma excited ion dope means. Of course, the ion implantation method, which performs mass separation, can be employed. Phosphorus is doped in the crystalline silicon film via the gate film <b>115</b> in this process.</p>
    <p num="p-0109">Next, heat treatment is performed at 600 to 1000° C. (preferably 700 to 800° C.) in an inactive atmosphere in order to activate the phosphorus that was doped in the process of FIG. <b>9</b>B. In this embodiment, heat treatment is performed at 800° C. for 1 hour in a nitrogen atmosphere.</p>
    <p num="p-0110">The active layer and the interface between the active layer and the gate insulating film that was damaged during the doping of phosphorus can be restored. It is preferred that electric heat furnaces be employed in this activating process such as furnace annealing, though light annealing such as lamp annealing and laser annealing can both be used.</p>
    <p num="p-0111">Through this process, the connecting portion with the boundary surface of the N-type impurity regions (b) <b>120</b> through <b>122</b>, that is, the intrinsic or substantially intrinsic portion that exists around the N-type impurity region (b) (of course including the P-type impurity region (b)) becomes clear. This means that the LDD region and the channel-forming region will form a remarkably good connecting portion at the time the TFT is completed.</p>
    <p num="p-0112">A conductive film that is to be a gate wiring is formed next. Although the gate wiring can be formed as a single layer conductive film, it is preferred that a lamination film of 2 or 3 layers be formed to meet the needs when required. In this embodiment, a first conductive film <b>123</b> and a second conductive film <b>124</b> are formed as the layered films. (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref>)</p>
    <p num="p-0113">Elements chosen from tantalum (Ta), titanium (Ti), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), chromium (Cr), and silicon (Si); conductive films from the above elements as the main component (typically a, nitride tantalum film, a nitride tungsten film, a nitride titanium film) or alloy films from the combination of the above elements (typically an alloy of Mo—W, an alloy of Mo—Ta) can be used for the first conductive film <b>123</b> and the second conductive film <b>124</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0114">It is better that the first conductive film <b>123</b> have a thickness of 10 to 50 nm (preferably 20 to 30 nm) and the second conductive film have a thickness of 200 to 400 nm (preferably 250 to 350 nm). In this embodiment, a 50 nm thickness of nitride tungsten (WN) film as the first conductive film <b>123</b> and a 350 nm thickness of tungsten film as the second conductive film <b>124</b> are employed. Further, although not shown, it is effective to form a silicon film of about 2 to 20 nm thickness under the first conductive film <b>123</b>. By forming this silicon film, the adhesion property of the conductive film formed thereon can be improved and oxidation can be prevented.</p>
    <p num="p-0115">Employing a nitride tantalum film as the first conductive film <b>123</b> and a tantalum film as the second conductive film is also effective.</p>
    <p num="p-0116">Next, 400 nm thickness of gate wirings <b>125</b> through <b>128</b> are formed by etching the first conductive film <b>123</b> and the second conductive film <b>124</b> together. During this time, the gate wirings <b>126</b> and <b>127</b>, formed in a driving circuit, are formed to overlap with a portion of the N-type impurity regions (b) <b>120</b> through <b>122</b> through the gate insulating film <b>115</b>. The gate wirings <b>128</b> <i>a </i>and <b>128</b> <i>b </i>can be seen as two wirings from a cross section, but actually the gate wirings <b>128</b> <i>a </i>and <b>128</b> <i>b </i>are formed of one pattern connected continuously. (FIG. <b>9</b>E).</p>
    <p num="p-0117">Then a resist mask <b>129</b> is formed and a P-type impurity element (boron in this embodiment) is doped so that the impurity regions <b>130</b> and <b>131</b> containing boron is formed at high concentration. In this embodiment, boron is doped at 3×10<sup>20 </sup>to 3×10<sup>21 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>(typically 5×10<sup>20 </sup>to 1×10<sup>21 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>) of concentration by the ion doping means employing diborane (of course ion implantation can be used). The present invention defines the impurity regions containing P-type impurity elements in the above concentration range as P-type impurity region (a). (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>)</p>
    <p num="p-0118">Subsequently, the resist mask <b>129</b> is removed and resist masks <b>132</b> through <b>134</b> are formed so as to cover the gate wirings and a region that is to be a P channel TFT. Then an N-type impurity element (phosphorus in this embodiment) is doped and impurity regions <b>135</b> through <b>141</b> containing phosphorus are formed at high concentration. The ion doping means employing phosphine (PH<sub>3</sub>) is also conducted here (of course ion implantation can be used). The concentration of phosphorus in this region is 1×10<sup>20 </sup>to 1×10<sup>21 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>(typically, 2×10<sup>20 </sup>to 5×10<sup>21 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>). (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>)</p>
    <p num="p-0119">The specifications of the present invention define the impurity regions containing N-type impurity elements in the above concentration range as N-type impurity region (a). Although the region in which the impurity regions <b>135</b> through <b>141</b> have been formed already contains phosphorus and boron that were doped in the previous process, there is no need to take into consideration the influences of phosphorus and boron that were doped in the previous process since it is considered that phosphorus was doped at a sufficient high concentration.</p>
    <p num="p-0120">Next, the resist masks <b>132</b> through <b>134</b> are removed and a cap film <b>142</b> formed of an insulating film containing silicon is formed at a film thickness of 25 to 100 nm (preferably 30 to 50 nm). A silicon nitride film of 25 nm thickness is used in this embodiment.</p>
    <p num="p-0121">Using the gate wirings <b>125</b> through <b>128</b> as masks, an N-type impurity element (phosphorus in this embodiment) is doped in a self-aligning manner. Impurity regions <b>143</b> through <b>146</b> formed in this way are adjusted so that phosphorus can be doped at a concentration of ½ to {fraction (1/10)} of the above N-type impurity regions (b) (typically ⅓ to ¼)(however, a concentration that is 5 to 10 times higher than the concentration of boron doped in the above-mentioned channel doping process, representatively 1×10<sup>16 </sup>to 5×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, typically 3×10<sup>17 </sup>to 3×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>). In the specification, the impurity regions containing N-type impurity elements (however, excluding P-type impurity region (a)) in the above concentration range are defined as N-type impurity region (c). (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>)</p>
    <p num="p-0122">As phosphorus is doped through a 105 nm film thickness of insulating film (the lamination film of the cap film <b>142</b> and the gate insulating film <b>115</b>), the cap film that is formed on the sidewall of the gate wirings <b>134</b> <i>a </i>and <b>134</b> <i>b </i>also functions as a mask. That is, the length of an off-set region corresponding to the film thickness of the cap film <b>142</b> is formed. In order to lower the value of the off-electric current, it is important to suppress the overlap of the LDD region and the gate wiring as much as possible. In this sense, providing an off-set region is effective.</p>
    <p num="p-0123">The length of the off-set region is determined by the film thickness of a cap film that is actually formed on the sidewall of a gate wiring or by a wraparound phenomenon during the doping of an impurity element (a phenomenon in which the doping of impurities is like slipping under the mask). From the viewpoint of suppressing the overlap of the LDD region and the gate wiring, it is extremely effective that a cap film be formed in advance when forming the N-type impurity region (c) as in the present embodiment.</p>
    <p num="p-0124">As phosphorus is also doped at a concentration of 1×10<sup>16 </sup>to 5×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>in all the impurity regions except the portion concealed by the gate wiring in this process, since concentration is extremely low, influences are not inflicted on the functions of each impurity region. Also, as boron is already doped in the N-type impurity regions (b) <b>143</b> through <b>146</b> at a concentration of 1×10<sup>15 </sup>to 1×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>in the channel doping process, phosphorus is doped at a concentration that is 5 to 10 times higher than the concentration of boron in the P-type impurity regions (b). In this situation, it can also be considered that boron does not influence the functions of the N-type impurity regions (b).</p>
    <p num="p-0125">However, strictly the phosphorus concentration of a portion of the N-type impurity regions (b) of either <b>147</b> or <b>148</b> that overlaps with the gate wiring is as it is, 2×10<sup>16 </sup>to 5×10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, though a 1×10<sup>16 </sup>to 5×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>concentration of phosphorus is added to the portion that does not overlap on the gate wiring, which means that the N-type impurity region contains phosphorus at a little higher concentration.</p>
    <p num="p-0126">Next, a first interlayer insulating film <b>149</b> is formed. The first interlayer insulating film <b>149</b> with a film thickness of 100 to 400 m can be formed of an insulating film containing silicon, specifically, a silicon nitride film, a silicon oxide film, a silicon oxide nitride film or a lamination film formed of a combination of the above films.</p>
    <p num="p-0127">Then heat treatment process is performed on the N-type or P-type impurity element, doped at its concentration respectively, for activation. In this process, heat treatment can be performed by furnace annealing, laser annealing, lamp annealing, or a combination of methods. If performing by furnace annealing, heat treatment is performed at 500 to 800° C., preferably at 550 to 600° C., in an inactive atmosphere. The impurity elements are activated at 600° C. for a duration of 4 hours in this embodiment. (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10D</figref>)</p>
    <p num="p-0128">Moreover, in the present embodiment, the silicon nitride film and the silicon oxide nitride film are formed in a laminated state so as to cover the gate wiring, and activation is performed in this state. Although tungsten is used as the material for wirings in this embodiment, it is known that the tungsten film is extremely weak to oxide. That is, even if the tungsten film is covered with a protective film when oxidized, the tungsten film is oxidized immediately if a pinhole exists in the protective film. Since the silicon nitride film and the silicon oxide nitride film are laminated in this embodiment, activation process can be performed at high temperature without worrying about the pinhole problem.</p>
    <p num="p-0129">Heat treatment is performed at 300 to 450° C. for a duration of 1 to 4 hours in an atmosphere containing 3 to 100% of hydrogen after the activation process. Then hydrogenation is carried out on the active layer. This process is to terminate dangling bonds in a semiconductor layer by thermally excited hydrogen. As other hydrogenation means, plasma hydrogenation (using hydrogen excited by plasma) can be performed.</p>
    <p num="p-0130">A second interlayer insulating film <b>150</b> at a thickness of 500 nm to 1.5 μm is formed on top of the first interlayer insulating film <b>146</b> after finishing the activation process. This second interlayer insulating film <b>150</b> is a silicon oxide film with an 800 nm thickness formed by plasma CVD in this embodiment. A 1 μm thickness of inter layer insulating film is formed by a lamination film of the first interlayer insulating film <b>149</b> (silicon nitride oxide film) and the second interlayer insulating film <b>150</b> (silicon oxide film) in this way.</p>
    <p num="p-0131">Furthermore, in a later process if thermal resistance permits, organic resin film such as polyimide, acrylic, polyamide, polyimide-amide, BCB (benzocyclobutene), and the like can be used as the second interlayer insulating film <b>150</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0132">A contact hole that reaches a source region or a drain region of a TFT opens and then source wirings <b>151</b> through <b>154</b> and drain wirings <b>155</b> through <b>157</b> are formed. The drain wiring <b>155</b> for forming the CMOS circuit is mutualized (common) between the P channel TFT and the N channel TFT. Though not shown, this wiring according to the present embodiment is a 3-layered structure formed of a 200 nm Ti film, a 500 nm aluminum film containing Ti, and a 100 nm Ti film by sputtering in successions.</p>
    <p num="p-0133">Subsequently, a silicon nitride film, a silicon oxide film, or a silicon oxide nitride film can be used to form a passivation film <b>158</b> at 50 to 500 nm in thickness (typically 200 to 300 nm). According to the embodiment, a silicon nitride oxide film with a film thickness of 300 nm is formed as the passivation film <b>158</b>. (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>) During this time, according to the present embodiment, a plasma process employing gas containing hydrogen such as H<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, and the like is performed in advance before forming the film and then heat treatment is performed after the forming of the film. The excited hydrogen from the previous process is supplied into the first and the second interlayer insulating film. By performing heat treatment in this state, improvements can be made on the film of the passivation film <b>115</b> together with effectively hydrogenating the active layer since the hydrogen that was doped into the first and the second interlayer insulating films has diffused to the lower layer.</p>
    <p num="p-0134">Furthermore, the hydrogenation process can be performed after forming the passivation film <b>158</b>. For example, performing heat treatment at 300 to 450° C. for 1 to 12 hours in an atmosphere containing 3 to 100% of hydrogen, or employing a plasma hydrogenation process in which similar effects can be obtained.</p>
    <p num="p-0135">Then, a third interlayer insulating film <b>159</b> formed of organic resin is formed at about 1 μm in thickness. Polyimide, acrylic, polyamide, polyimide-amide, BCB (benzocyclobutene), etc. can be used as inorganic resin. The advantages of using organic resin are the simplification of forming a film, the reduction of a parasitic capacity due to a low dielectric constant, and having excellent flatness. Other organic resin or organic-based SiO compounds besides the ones mentioned above can be employed as well. Here, after coating the substrate, the interlayer insulating film <b>159</b> is formed by baking at 300° C. using a type of acrylic that is thermal polymeric.</p>
    <p num="p-0136">In a region that is to be a pixel circuit, a shielding film <b>160</b> is formed on top of the third interlayer insulating film <b>159</b>. In the context of the present invention, the term “shielding film” means the shielding of light and electromagnetic wave. The shielding film <b>160</b> is formed of an element selected from aluminum (Al), titanium (Ti), and tantalum (Ta) or has one of these elements as a main component at a thickness of 100 to 300 nm. According to the present embodiment, an aluminum film containing 1 wt % of titanium is formed at 125 nm in thickness.</p>
    <p num="p-0137">Moreover, by forming a 5 to 50 nm of insulating film such as a silicon oxide film and the like on top of the third interlayer insulating film <b>159</b>, the adhesion of the shielding film to be formed thereon can be raised. Further, by applying the plasma process using CF<sub>4 </sub>gas on to a surface of the third interlayer insulating film <b>159</b> formed of inorganic resin, the adhesion of the shielding film to be formed on the film can be raised due to modification of the surface.</p>
    <p num="p-0138">By employing the aluminum film containing titanium, not only can the shielding film be formed but other connection wiring can be formed also. For example, connection wiring for connecting circuits in a driving circuit can be formed. However, in this situation, it is necessary to open a contact hole in the third interlayer insulating film in advance before the deposition of the materials that form the shielding film or the connection wire.</p>
    <p num="p-0139">Next, an oxide <b>161</b> is formed at 20 to 100 nm (preferably 30 to 50 nm) in thickness by anodic oxidation or plasma oxidation on the surface of the shielding film <b>160</b> (anodic oxidation in the present embodiment). According to the present embodiment, since a film mainly composed of aluminum is used as the shielding film <b>160</b>, an aluminum oxide film (alumina film) is formed as the anodic oxide film. (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>) The anodic oxide <b>161</b> is formed on the surface of the shielding film <b>160</b> at about a thickness of 50 nm thereby the film thickness of the shielding film <b>160</b> becomes 90 nm. A user can appropriately set the numeric value that relates to the anodic oxidation method.</p>
    <p num="p-0140">The process here was to employ anodic oxidation to form an insulating film provided only on the surface of the shielding film, though other gaseous methods such as plasma CVD, thermal CVD, or sputtering can be employed to form the insulating film. In that case preferably the film thickness be 20 to 100 nm (preferably 30 to 50 nm). Also, a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film, a silicon oxide nitride film, a DLC (Diamond like carbon) film, a tantalum oxide film or an organic resin film and further a combination of the above as a lamination film can be used as the insulating film.</p>
    <p num="p-0141">Thereafter, a contact hole that goes through the third interlayer insulating film <b>159</b> and the passivation film <b>158</b> and reaches the drain wiring <b>157</b> is opened.</p>
    <p num="p-0142">In the present embodiment, after forming a resist mask (not shown), by performing dry etching which uses mixed gas containing CF<sub>4 </sub>and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), a contact hole that goes through the third interlayer insulating film (acrylic) <b>159</b> and the passivation film (silicon oxide nitride film) <b>158</b> is opened at the same time in one etching.</p>
    <p num="p-0143">Furthermore, according to the present embodiment, the flow rate of CF<sub>4 </sub>and the flow rate of O<sub>2 </sub>was adjusted so that the ratio (selective ratio) of the etching rate of the third interlayer insulating film to the etching rate of the passivation film is 2:1. By doing this, a contact hole having a good shape can be opened as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0144">Dry etching was performed when the flow rate of CF<sub>4 </sub>was set at 50 sccm, the flow rate of O<sub>2 </sub>at 50 sccm, the flow rate of He at 35 sccm, electric power of RF at 400 W, and gas pressure at 0.3 Torr.</p>
    <p num="p-0145">Subsequently, a pixel electrode <b>162</b> is formed in the contact hole formed by the above process. A pixel electrode <b>163</b> is the pixel electrode of a neighboring different pixel. If the pixel electrodes <b>162</b> and <b>163</b> are to be transmission type liquid crystal display devices, a transparent conductive film is used. On the other hand, if they are to be reflection type liquid crystal display devices, a metallic film is used. Here the pixel electrodes are transmission type liquid crystal devices; therefore an indium tin oxide (ITO) film is formed to a thickness of 110 nm by sputtering. (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>)</p>
    <p num="p-0146">The pixel electrode <b>162</b> and the shielding film <b>160</b> overlap via the anodic oxide <b>161</b> to form a capacitance storage <b>164</b> at this time. In this case, it is desirable that the shielding film <b>160</b> be set at a floating state (in an electrically independent state) or at a fixed electric potential, preferably a common electric potential (inter-electric potential of image signals sent as data).</p>
    <p num="p-0147">An active matrix substrate having a driving circuit and a pixel circuit on the same substrate is completed this way. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, a P channel TFT <b>301</b> and N channel TFTs <b>302</b> and <b>303</b> are formed in the driving circuit; a pixel TFT <b>304</b> formed of an N channel TFT is formed in the pixel circuit.</p>
    <p num="p-0148">In the P channel TFT <b>301</b> of the driving circuit, a channel forming region <b>201</b>, a source region <b>202</b>, and a drain region <b>203</b> are respectively formed in the P-type impurity regions (a). However, strictly the source region <b>202</b> and the drain region <b>203</b> contain phosphorus at a concentration of 1×10<sup>16 </sup>to 5×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
    <p num="p-0149">Further, in the N channel TFT <b>302</b>, a channel forming region <b>204</b>, a source region <b>205</b> and a drain region <b>206</b> are formed. Also, a region <b>207</b>, which overlaps a gate wiring via a gate insulating film, is formed between the channel forming region and the drain region (the present invention calls this region “Lov” region, where “ov” refers to overlap). The Lov region <b>207</b> at this time contains phosphorus at a concentration of 2×10<sup>16 </sup>to 5×10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>and is formed as to overlap the gate wiring completely.</p>
    <p num="p-0150">Furthermore, in the N channel TFT <b>303</b>, a channel forming region <b>208</b>, a source region <b>209</b> and a drain region <b>210</b> are formed. Also, LDD regions <b>211</b> and <b>212</b> are formed in manner sandwiching the channel forming region. That is, an LDD region is formed between the source region and the channel forming region, and between the drain region and the channel forming region.</p>
    <p num="p-0151">Since the LDD regions <b>211</b> and <b>212</b> are arranged so that a portion of the region overlaps with the gate wiring in this structure, via a gate insulating film, a region that overlaps with the gate wiring (Lov region) and a region that does not overlap with the gate wiring (the present invention calls this type of region “Loff region,”, “off” meaning offset) are realized.</p>
    <p num="p-0152">The LDD region <b>211</b> can further be classified as an Lov region and an Loff region. The above Lov region contains phosphorus at a concentration of 2×10<sup>16 </sup>to 5×10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>while the Loff region contains phosphorus at a concentration that is 1 to 2 times higher that the Lov region (typically, 1.2 to 1.5 times).</p>
    <p num="p-0153">In the pixel TFT <b>304</b>, channel forming regions <b>213</b> and <b>214</b>, a source region <b>215</b>, a drain region <b>216</b>, Loff regions <b>217</b> through <b>220</b>, and an N-type impurity region (a) <b>221</b> that contacts with the Loff region <b>218</b> and <b>219</b> are formed. At this time, the source region <b>215</b> and the drain region <b>216</b> are respectively formed in the N-type impurity region (a) and the Loff regions <b>217</b> through <b>220</b> are formed in the N-type impurity region (c).</p>
    <p num="p-0154">The present embodiment is able to improve the operating efficiency and reliability of a semiconductor device by optimizing the structure of TFTs which form each circuit to meet the circuit specifications demanded by pixel circuits and driving circuits. More specifically, N channel TFT can realize both a TFT structure attaining a high-speed operation or focusing on a hot carrier countermeasure and a TFT structure focusing on a low off current operation on the same substrate by making the arrangement of the LDD region different depending upon the circuit specifications and by distinguishing the Lov region from the Loff region.</p>
    <p num="p-0155">Moreover, the width of the Lov region <b>207</b> of the N channel TFT <b>302</b> is 0.3 to 3.0 μm, typically. 0.5 to 1.5 μm, with respect to the 3 to 7 μm of channel length. The width of the Lov region and the Loff region of the N channel TFT can be 0.3 to 3.0 μm, typically 0.5 to 1.5 μm, and 1.0 to 3.5 μm, typically 1.5 to 2.0 μm respectively. The width of the Loff regions <b>217</b> to <b>220</b> provided in the pixel TFT <b>304</b> can be 0.5 to 3.5 μm, typically 2.0 to 2.5 μm.</p>
    <p num="p-0156">The present embodiment uses an alumina film that has a high 7 to 9 dielectric constant as the dielectric of capacitance storage, and therefore the occupying area that is necessary for the capacitance storage to form the necessary capacity can be reduced. Moreover, the opening rate (aperture ratio) of the image display portion of the active matrix liquid display device can be improved by making the shielding film, which is formed on the pixel TFT, as the other electrode of the capacitance storage as in the present embodiment.</p>

    <p num="p-0158">A process of manufacturing an active matrix liquid crystal display from an active matrix substrate is described hereon.

It is appropriate to form a color filter or a shielding film on the facing substrate (counter substrate) whenever it requires.</p>
    <p num="p-0159">After forming the orientated film, a rubbing operation is performed to make adjustments so that the crystal molecules are orientated at a fixed pre-tilt angle. Then using a well-known cell assembling process, the counter substrate and the active matrix substrate formed of the pixel circuit and the driving circuit are stuck with sealing materials or a spacer (both not shown). Then, after injecting a liquid crystal <b>405</b> between the two substrates, the liquid crystal is completely sealed by a sealing agent (not shown).

    <p num="p-0161">Further, the illustration in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is an example of a structure of a circuit of the active matrix liquid crystal display shown in FIG. <b>13</b>.

    <p num="p-0162">Furthermore, the structure of the present invention can be easily realized by manufacturing a TFT following the processes indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 through 12</figref>. Although the present embodiment illustrates only the structure of a pixel circuit and a driving circuit, other signal operating circuits (or logic circuits) such as a signal division circuit, a frequency dividing circuit, a D/A converter circuit, an operational amplifier circuit, a γ correction circuit, and a microprocessor circuit as well can be formed on the same substrate according to the manufacturing method of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0163">In this way, the present invention can provide a semiconductor device that includes on the same substrate at least a pixel circuit and a driving circuit for controlling the pixel circuit. For example, a semiconductor device provided with a signal operating circuit, a driving circuit, and a pixel circuit all on the same substrate can be realized.</p>
    <p num="p-0164">A crystalline silicon film that has unique crystal structures in which the crystal lattices have continuous characteristics is formed if the process according to the present embodiment is performed until FIG. <b>9</b>B. Details relating to this kind of crystalline silicon film can be referred by the present applicant in Japanese Patent Application No. Hei 10-044659, Japanese Patent Application No. Hei 10-152316, Japanese Patent Application No. Hei 10-152308, or Japanese Patent Application No.Hei 10-152305. Hereinafter, a characteristic of a crystal structure experimentally examined by the applicant is briefly explained. Besides, this characteristic coincides with the characteristic of the semiconductor layer in this embodiment which forms the active layer of the TFT.</p>
    <p num="p-0165">The above crystalline silicon film has a crystal structure in which there are a plurality of needle like and rod like crystals (hereinafter abbreviated as rod-like crystal) collectively arranged as seen from a microscopic observation. This can be easily confirmed by observation through a TEM (transmission electron microscope).</p>
    <p num="p-0166">Further, by utilizing electron beam diffraction and X-ray diffraction, it can be confirmed that the surface of the crystalline silicon film (the portion that forms a channel) has a {110} plane as the main orientation plane though the crystal axis is somewhat tilted. If an analysis was performed using the electron beam diffraction now, it can be confirmed that the diffraction spot, which corresponds to the {110} plane, will appear nicely. The fact that each spot has a concentric circle distribution can also be confirmed.</p>
    <p num="p-0167">Furthermore, when the grain boundary formed by the connection of every rod-like crystal is observed through a HR-TEM (High Resolution-Transmission Electron Microscope), the crystal lattice of the grain boundary having continuity properties can be confirmed. This observation can be easily confirmed from the fact that the lattice stripes in the grain boundary being observed were continuously linked together.</p>
    <p num="p-0168">Due to the continuity of the crystal lattices in the crystal grain boundary, the crystal grain boundary is called “plane-like grain boundary”. In the present invention, the definition of the plane-like grain boundary is “planar boundary disclosed in “Characterization of High-Efficiency Cast-Si Solar Cell Wafers by MBIC Measurement; Ryuichi Shimokawa and Yutaka Hayashi, Japanese Journal of Applied Physics vol. 27, No. 5, pp. 751-758, 1988</p>
    <p num="p-0169">According to the above article, a twin grain boundary, an unique lamination defect, and an unique twist grain boundary are included as the plane-like grain boundary and this plane-like grain boundary has a characteristic of being electrically inactive. That is, although the plane-like grain boundary is a crystal grain boundary, it does not function as a trap to obstruct the movements of carriers. Thus, the plane-like grain boundary can be regarded as substantially non-existing.</p>
    <p num="p-0170">Especially when the crystal axis (perpendicular axis to the crystal plane) is axis &lt;110&gt;, a {211} twin crystal grain boundary can also be called the corresponding grain boundary of the Σ<b>3</b>. The value of Σ<b>3</b> is a parameter, that is a pointer for indicating the degree of conformity of the corresponding grain boundary. The smaller the value of Σ, the better the conformity of the grain boundary is well known.</p>
    <p num="p-0171">If the crystalline silicon film of the present embodiment is actually observed in detail under the TEM, almost all (above 90%, typically above 95%) of the crystal grain boundary are the Σ<b>3</b> of the corresponding grain boundary, typically the {211} twin crystal grain boundary.</p>
    <p num="p-0172">It is known that the grain boundary formed between two crystal grains becomes the corresponding grain boundary of Σ<b>3</b> when the plane direction of the two crystals is {110} and the angle θ formed by a lattice stripe which corresponds to a {111} plane is θ=70.5°. Each lattice stripe of the crystal grains lined next to each other in the crystal grain boundary of the crystalline silicon film according the present embodiment is surely linked together at an angle about 70.5°. From this fact, it can be said that the crystal grain boundary is the corresponding grain boundary of Σ<b>3</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0173">Moreover, the crystal grain boundary becomes the corresponding grain boundary of Σ<b>9</b> when θ=38.9° meaning that other corresponding grain boundaries do exist. However, in any case, all are inactive.</p>
    <p num="p-0174">Corresponding grain boundaries of this type are only formed between crystal grains of the same plane direction. That is, the plane direction of the crystalline silicon film of the present embodiment is substantially aligned at {110} which is why a wide range of this type of corresponding grain boundary can be formed.</p>
    <p num="p-0175">This kind of crystal structure (precisely the structure of a crystal grain boundary) indicates that the joining of two different types of crystal grains in the crystal grain boundary is extremely conforming. That is, in the crystal grain boundary, the crystal lattices are linked together continuously and structured in such a way making it extremely difficult to form trap levels which are caused by crystal defects and the like. Hence, it can be regarded that crystal grain boundary substantially does not exist in a semiconductor thin film having this kind of crystal structure.</p>
    <p num="p-0176">Furthermore, it has been confirmed from a TEM observation that almost all the defects existing inside a crystal grain are extinguished through a heat treatment process at a very high temperature of 800 to 1150° C. (corresponding to the thermal oxidation in embodiment 1). This is obvious since the number of defects has been largely lessened after thermal oxidation.</p>
    <p num="p-0177">The difference in the number of defects will appear as the difference in spin density through an electron spin resonance analysis (ESR). The spin density of the crystalline silicon film according to the present embodiment in the present state has been identified as at least 5×10<sup>17 </sup>spins/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less (preferably 3×10<sup>17 </sup>spins/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less). However, this measured value is near the value that the present existing measurement device can limitedly detect. The actual spin density is expected to be lower.</p>
    <p num="p-0178">From the above explanation, the defects inside a crystal grain of the crystalline silicon film according to the present embodiment are extremely small, and since it is proved that a crystal grain boundary substantially does not exists, it is appropriate to consider the crystalline silicon film as a single-crystal silicon film or a substantially single-crystal silicon film.</p>

    <p num="h-0011">Embodiment 4</p>
    <p num="p-0185">A diversity of crystal liquid materials can be used in a liquid crystal display device manufactured by the present invention. As such materials, there are TN liquid crystal, PDLC (Polymer Distributed Liquid Crystal), FLC (Ferroelectric Liquid Crystal), AFLC (Antiferroelectric Liquid Crystal), or a mixture of FLC and AFLC (Antiferroelectric LCD).</p>
    <p num="p-0186">For example, materials disclosed in “H. Furue et al.; Characteristics and Driving Scheme of Polymer-Stabilized Monostable FLCD Exhibiting Fast Response Time and High Contrast Ratio with Gray-Scale Capability, SID, 1988”, “T. Yoshida et al.; A Full-Color Thresholdless Antiferroelectric LCD Exhibiting Wide Viewing Angle with Fast Response Time, 841, SID97DIGEST, 1997”, “S. Inui et al.; Thresholdless Antiferroelectricity in Liquid Crystals and its Application to Displays, 671-673, J. Mater. Chem. 6(4), 1996”, or U.S. Pat. No. 5,594,569 can be used.</p>
    <p num="p-0187">Specifically, with respect to an electric field, as Thresholdless Antiferroelectric LCD (abbreviated as TL-AFLC) that indicates electro-optical response characteristic of continuously changing transmission rate, there is a type that indicates a V-shaped type (or U-shaped type) of electro-optical response characteristic. It has been proved that the drive voltage is approximately ±2.5 V (cell thickness is about 1 μm to 2 μm). Due to this fact, there are cases where the power voltage for pixel circuits is sufficient from 5 to 8 V and the possibility of operating the driving circuit and the pixel circuit at the same power source voltage has been suggested. That is, attempts can be made on the low consumption of electric power of the whole liquid display device.</p>
    <p num="p-0188">Ferroelectric liquid crystals and antiferroelectric liquid crystals have an advantage of having a faster response velocity when compared with TN liquid crystals. For realizing TFTs like the TFT used in the present invention which has extremely rapid operational velocity, a liquid crystal display device having a fast image response velocity can be realized by sufficiently utilizing the speed of the response velocity of ferroelectric liquid crystals and antiferroelectric liquid crystals.</p>
    <p num="p-0189">Generally, the voluntary polarization of the thresholdless antiferroelectric LCD is large and the dielectric constant high. For this reason, when utilizing the thresholdless ferroelectric liquid crystal in the liquid crystal display device, a comparatively bigger capacitance storage is needed for the pixel. Therefore, the utilization of a thresholdless antiferroelectric LCD of smaller voluntary polarization is preferred. In this sense, the capacitance storage shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> of embodiment 1 is preferable since this capacitance storage can accumulate a large capacity in a small area.</p>
    <p num="p-0190">Needless to say, utilizing the liquid crystal display device of this embodiment as the display for electronic equipment such as a personal computer and the like is effective.</p>

    <p num="p-0193">First, a first conductive film <b>1601</b>, a first insulating film <b>1602</b>, a thin second insulating film, and an organic resin film <b>1604</b> are formed one after another in laminations on a substrate <b>1600</b>. (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>)</p>
    <p num="p-0194">A silicon nitride film, a silicon oxide film, or a silicon oxide nitride film all of which at 100 to 400 nm in thickness can be used as the first insulating film. A 200 nm thickness of silicon oxide nitride film formed by plasma CVD using SiH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, and NH<sub>3 </sub>as raw gas is used in this embodiment (however, nitrogen concentration is 25 to 50 atomic %).</p>
    <p num="p-0195">Further, although a 30 nm thickness of silicon oxide film formed by plasma CVD is used in this embodiment as the second insulating film, other silicon oxide films with a 20 to 50 nm in thickness can be used.</p>
    <p num="p-0196">Furthermore, the organic resin film is formed of a 1 μm of acrylic resin film that is formed in laminations by the coating method.</p>
    <p num="p-0197">After achieving the state in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>, a resist mask <b>1605</b> is formed by photolithography and then the lamination film of the laminated first insulating film <b>1602</b> and the organic resin film <b>1604</b> are simultaneously etched one time to form a contact hole. (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>) This etching is dry etching using etchant gas, which is mixed gas containing at least oxygen and fluorine-based gas. In this embodiment, dry etching was conducted with the flow rate of CF<sub>4 </sub>set at 50 sccm, flow rate of O<sub>2 </sub>at 50 sccm, flow rate of He at 35 sccm, electric power of RF at 400 W, and gas pressure at 0.3 Torr.</p>

    <p num="p-0199">Compared with the etching rate of the organic resin film <b>1604</b> and the first insulating film <b>1602</b>, the second insulating film <b>1603</b> with a slower etching rate has been chosen in this embodiment. Since the film thickness of the second insulating film <b>1603</b> is thin, removal is accomplished without changing the conditions. By using this type of second insulating film, there are no longer any etched remains of organic resin and a contact hold with little dispersion in its shape can be formed.</p>
