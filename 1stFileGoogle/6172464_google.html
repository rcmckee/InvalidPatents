    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Objects of the Invention</p>
    <p>Objects of the present invention are those of providing for cost-effective electronic ballasts as well as compact screw-in fluorescent lamps.</p>
    <p>This as well as other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description and claims.</p>
    <p>Brief Description</p>
    <p>The present invention is directed to providing improved inverter circuits for powering and controlling gas discharge lamps. The inverter circuits according to the present invention are highly efficient, can be compactly constructed and are ideally suited for energizing gas discharge lamps, particularly “instant-start” and “self-ballasted” fluorescent lamps.</p>
    <p>According to one form of the present invention, a series-connected combination of an inductor and a capacitor is provided in circuit with the inverter transistors to be energized upon periodic transistor conduction. Transistor drive current is preferably provided through the use of at least one saturable inductor to control the transistor inversion frequency to be equal to or greater than the nature resonant frequency of the inductor and capacitor combination. The high voltages efficiently developed by loading the inverter with the inductor and capacitor are ideally suited for energizing external loads such as gas discharge lamps. In such an application, the use of an adjustable inductor permits control of the inverter output as a means of adjusting the level of lamp illumination.</p>
    <p>According to another important form of the present invention, reliable and highly efficient half-bridge inverters include a saturable inductor in a current feedback circuit to drive the transistors for alternate conduction. The inverters also include a load having an inductance sufficient to effect periodic energy storage for self-sustained transistor inversion. Importantly, improved reliability is achieved because of the relatively low and transient-free voltages across the transistors in these half-bridge inverters.</p>
    <p>Further, according to another feature of the present invention, novel and economical power supplies particularly useful with the disclosed inverter circuits convert conventional AC input voltages to DC for supplying to the inverters.</p>
    <p>Yet further, according to still another feature of the invention, a rapid-start fluorescent lamp is powered by way of a series-resonant LC circuit; while heating power for the lamp's cathodes is provided via loosely-coupled auxiliary windings on the tank inductor of the LC circuit. Alternatively, cathode heating power is provided from tightly-coupled windings on the tank inductor; in which case output current-limiting is provided via a non-linear resistance means, such as an incandescent filament in a light bulb, connected in series with the output of each winding.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p>FIG. 1 illustrates a screw-in gas discharge lamp unit <b>10</b> comprising a folded fluorescent lamp <b>11</b> suitably secured to an integral base <b>12</b>. The lamp comprises two cathodes <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> which are supplied with the requisite high operating voltage from a frequency-converting power supply and ballasting circuit <b>16</b>; which, because of its compact size, conveniently fits within the base <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p>The inverter circuit <b>16</b> is connected by leads <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> to a screw-type plug <b>19</b> adapted for screw-in insertion into a standard Edison-type incandescent lamp socket at which ordinary 120 Volt/60 Hz power line voltage is available. A ground plane comprising a wire or metallic strip <b>21</b> is disposed adjacent a portion of the fluorescent lamp <b>11</b> as a starting aid. Finally, a manually rotatable external knob <b>22</b> is connected to a shaft for mechanical adjustment of the air gap of a ferrite core inductor to vary the inductance value thereof in order to effect adjustment of the inverter voltage output connected to electrodes <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> for controlled variation of the lamp illumination intensity.</p>
    <p>With reference to FIG. 2, a power supply <b>23</b>, connected to a conventional AC input, provides a DC output for supplying a high-efficiency inverter circuit <b>24</b>. The inverter is operable to provide a high voltage to an external load <b>26</b>, which may comprise a gas discharge device such as the fluorescent lamp <b>11</b> of FIG. <b>1</b>.</p>
    <p>The power supply <b>23</b> comprises bridge rectifier having four diodes <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>29</b> and <b>31</b> connectable to a 240 volt AC supply at terminals <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>. Capacitors <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> are connected between a ground line <b>37</b> (in turn directly connected to the inverter <b>24</b>) and to a B+ line <b>38</b> and a B− line <b>39</b>, respectively. The power supply <b>23</b> also comprises a voltage doubler and rectifier optionally connectable to a 120 volt AC input taken between the ground line <b>37</b> and terminal <b>33</b> or <b>32</b>. The voltage doubler and rectifier means provides a direct electrical connection by way of line <b>37</b> netween one of the 120 volt AC power input lines and the inverter <b>24</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>2</b>. The bridge rectifier and the voltage doubler and rectifier provide substantially the same DC output voltage to the inverter <b>24</b> whether the AC input is 120 or 240 volts. Typical voltages are +160 volts on the B+ line <b>38</b> and −160 volts on the B− line <b>39</b>.</p>
    <p>With additional reference to FIG. 4, which shows an alternate power supply <b>23</b>′, the AC input, whether 120 or 240 volts, is provided at terminals <b>32</b>′ and <b>39</b>. Terminal <b>39</b> is in turn connected through a single-pole double-throw selector switch <b>41</b> to terminal <b>37</b>′ (for 120 volt operation) or terminal <b>33</b>′ (for 240 volt operation). In all other respects, power supplies <b>23</b> and <b>23</b>′ are identical.</p>
    <p>The inverter circuit <b>24</b> of FIG. 2 is a half-bridge inverter comprising transistors <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> connected in series across the DC voltage output of the power supply <b>23</b> on B+ and B− lines <b>38</b> and <b>39</b>, respectively. The collector of trasistor <b>42</b> is connected to the B+ line <b>38</b>, the emitter of transistor <b>42</b> and the collector of transistor <b>43</b> are connected to a midpoint line <b>44</b> (designated “M”) and the emitter of transistor <b>43</b> is connected to the B− line <b>39</b>. The midpoint line <b>44</b> is in turn connected to the ground line <b>37</b> through primary winding <b>46</b> of a toroidal saturable core transformer <b>47</b>, a primary winding <b>48</b> on an identical transformer <b>49</b>, an inductor <b>51</b> and a series-connected capacitor <b>52</b>. The inductor <b>51</b> and capacitor <b>52</b> are energized upon alternate transistor conduction in a manner to be described later.</p>
    <p>An external load <b>26</b> is preferably taken off capacitor <b>52</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>2</b>. The inductor <b>51</b>, preferably a known ferrite core inductor, has an inductance variable by mechanical adjustment of the air gap in order to effect variation in the level of the inductor and capacitor voltage and hence the power available to the load, as will be described. When the load is a gas discharge lamp such as lamp <b>11</b> in FIG. 1, variation in this inductance upon rotation of knob <b>22</b> accomplishes a lamp dimming effect.</p>
    <p>Drive current to the base terminals of transistors <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> is provided by secondary windings <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> of transformers <b>49</b>, <b>47</b>, respectively. Winding <b>53</b> is also connected to midpoint lead <b>44</b> through a bias capacitor <b>56</b>, while winding <b>54</b> is connected to the B− lead <b>39</b> through an identical bias capacitor <b>57</b>. The base terminals of transistors <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> are also connected to lines <b>38</b> and <b>44</b> through bias resistors <b>58</b> and <b>59</b>, respectively. For a purpose to be described later, the base of transistor <b>42</b> can be optionally connected to a diode <b>61</b> and a series Zener diode <b>64</b> in turn connected to the midpoint line <b>44</b>; similarly, a diode <b>63</b> and series Zener diode <b>64</b> in turn connected to the B− line <b>39</b> can be connected to the base of transistor <b>43</b>. Shunt diodes <b>66</b> and <b>67</b> are connected across the collector-emitter terminals of transistors <b>42</b> and <b>43</b>, respectively. Finally, a capacitor <b>68</b> is connected across the collector-emitter terminals of transistor <b>43</b> to restrain the rate of voltage rise across those terminals, as will be seen presently.</p>
    <p>The operation of the circuit of FIG. 2 can best be understood with additional reference to FIG. 3, which illustrates significant portions of the waveforms of the voltage at midpoint M (FIG. <b>3</b>A), the base-emitter voltage on transistor <b>42</b> (FIG. <b>3</b>B), the current through transistor <b>42</b> (FIG. <b>3</b>C), and the capacitor <b>52</b> voltage and the inductor <b>51</b> current (FIG. <b>3</b>D).</p>
    <p>Assuming that transistor <b>42</b> is first to be triggered into conduction, current flows from the B+ line <b>38</b> through windings <b>46</b> and <b>38</b> and the inductor <b>51</b> to charge capacitor <b>52</b> and returns through capacitor <b>34</b> (refer to the time period designated I in FIG. <b>3</b>). When the saturable inductor <b>49</b> saturates at the end of period I, drive current to the base of transistor <b>42</b> will terminate, causing voltage on the base of the transistor to drop to the negative voltage stored on the bias capacitor <b>56</b> in a manner to be described, causing this transistor to become non-conductive. As shown in FIG. <b>3</b> <i>c</i>, current-flow in transistor <b>43</b> terminates at the end of period I.</p>
    <p>Because the current through inductor <b>51</b> cannot change instantaneously, current will flow from the B− bus <b>39</b> through capacitor <b>68</b>, causing the voltage at midpoint line <b>44</b> to drop to −160 volts (period II in FIG. <b>3</b>). The capacitor <b>68</b> restrains the rate of voltage change across the collector and emitter terminals of transistor <b>42</b>. The current through the inductor <b>51</b> reaches its maximum value when the voltage at the midpoint line <b>44</b> is zero. During period III, the current will continue to flow through inductor <b>51</b> but will be supplied from the B− bus through the shunt diode <b>67</b>. It will be appreciated that during the latter half of period II and all of period III, positive current is being drawn from a negative voltage; which, in reality, means that energy is being returned to the power supply through a path of relatively low impedance.</p>
    <p>When the inductor current reaches zero at the start of period IV, the current through the primary winding <b>46</b> of the saturable inductor <b>47</b> will cause a current to flow out of its secondary winding <b>54</b> to cause transistor <b>43</b> to become conductive, thereby causing a reversal in the direction of current through inductor <b>51</b> and capacitor <b>52</b>. When transformer <b>47</b> saturates at the end of period IV, the drive current to the base of transistor <b>43</b> terminates and the current through inductor <b>51</b> will be supplied through capacitor <b>68</b>, causing the voltage at midpoint line <b>44</b> to rise (period V). When the voltage at the midpoint line M reaches 160 volts, the current will then flow through shunt diode <b>66</b> (period VI). The cycle is then repeated.</p>
    <p>As seen in FIG. 3, saturable transformers <b>47</b>, <b>49</b> provide transistor drive current only after the current through inductor <b>51</b> has diminished to zero. Further, the transistor drive current is terminated before the current through inductor <b>51</b> has reached its maximum amplitude. This coordination of base drive current and inductor current is achieved because of the series-connection between the inductor <b>51</b> and the primary windings <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> of saturable transformers <b>47</b>, <b>49</b>, respectively.</p>
    <p>The series-connected combination of the inductor <b>51</b> and the capacitor <b>52</b> is energized upon the alternate conduction of transistors <b>42</b> and <b>43</b>. With a large value of capacitance of capacitor <b>52</b>, very little voltage will be developed across its terminals. As the value of this capacitance is decreased, however, the voltage across this capacitor will increase. As the value of the capacitor <b>52</b> is reduced to achieve resonance with the inductor <b>51</b>, the voltage on the capacitor will rise and become infinite in a loss-free circuit operating under ideal conditions.</p>
    <p>It has been found desirable to regulate the transistor inversion frequency, determined mainly by the saturation time of the saturable inductors <b>47</b>, <b>49</b>, to be equel to or higher than the natural resonance frequency of the inductor and capacitor combination in order to provide a high voltage output to external load <b>26</b>. A high voltage across capacitor <b>52</b> is efficiently developed as the transistor inversion frequency approaches the natural resonant frequency of the inductor <b>51</b> and capacitor <b>52</b> combination. Stated another way, the conduction period of each transistor is desirably shorter in duration than one quarter of the full period corresponding to the natural resonant frequency of the inductor and capacitor combination. When the inverter <b>24</b> is used with a self-ballasted gas discharge lamp unit, it has been found that the inversion frequency can be at least equal to the natural resonant frequency of the tank circuit. If the capacitance value of capacitor <b>52</b> is reduced still further beyond the resonance point, unacceptably high transistor currents will be experienced during transistor switching and transistor burn-out will occur.</p>
    <p>It will be appreciated that the sizing of capacitor <b>52</b> is determined by the application of the inverter circuit <b>24</b>. Variation in the values of the capacitor <b>52</b> and the inductor <b>51</b> will determine the voltages developed in the inductor-capacitor tank circuit. The external load <b>26</b> may be connected in circuit with the inductor <b>51</b> (by a winding on the inductor, for example) and the capacitor may be omitted entirely. If the combined circuit loading of the inductor <b>51</b> and the external load <b>26</b> has an effective inductance of value sufficient to effect periodic energy storage for self-sustained transistor inversion, the current feedback provided by the saturable inductors <b>47</b>,<b>49</b> will effect alternate transistor conduction without the need for additional voltage feedback. When the capacitor <b>52</b> is omitted, the power supply <b>23</b> provides a direct electrical connection between one of the AC power input lines and the inverter load circuit.</p>
    <p>Because the voltages across transistors <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> are relatively low (due to the effect of capacitors <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>), the half-bridge inverter <b>24</b> is very reliable. The absence of switching transients minimizes the possibility of transistor burn-out.</p>
    <p>The inverter circuit <b>24</b> comprises means for supplying reverse bias to the conducting transistor upon saturation of its associated saturable inductor. For this purpose, the capacitors <b>56</b> and <b>57</b> are charged to negative voltages as a result of reset current flowing into secondary windings <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> from the bases of transistors <b>42</b>, <b>43</b>, respectively. This reverse current rapidly turns off a conducting transistor to increase its switching speed and to achieve inverter circuit efficiency in a manner described more fully in my co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 103,624 filed Dec. 14, 1979 and entitled “Bias Control for High Efficiency Inverter Circuit” (now U.S. Pat. No. 4,307,353). The more negative the voltage on the bias capacitors <b>56</b> and <b>57</b>, the more rapidly charges are swept out of the bases of their associated transistors upon transistor turn-off.</p>
    <p>When a transistor base-emitter junction is reversely biased, it exhibits the characteristics of a Zener diode having a reverse breakdown voltage on the order of 8 to 14 Volt for transistors typically used in high-voltage inverters. As an alternative, to provide a negative voltage smaller in magnitude on the base lead of typical transistor <b>42</b> during reset operation, the optional diode <b>61</b> and Zener diode <b>62</b> combination can be used. For large values of the bias capacitor <b>56</b>, the base voltage will be substantially constant.</p>
    <p>If the load <b>26</b> comprises a gas discharge lamp, the voltage across the capacitor <b>52</b> will be reduced once the lamp is ignited to prevent voltages on the inductor <b>51</b> and the capacitor <b>52</b> from reaching destructive levels. Such a lamp provides an initial time delay during which a high voltage, suitable for instant starting, is available.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5 illustrates the use of an alternate load <b>26</b>′ adapted for plug-in connection to an inverter circuit such as shown in FIG. <b>2</b>. The load <b>26</b>′ consists of a gas discharge lamp <b>71</b> having electrodes <b>72</b>, <b>73</b> and connected in series with a capacitor <b>74</b>. The combination of lamp <b>71</b> and capacitor <b>74</b> is connected in parallel with a capacitor <b>52</b>′ which serves the same purpose as capacitor <b>52</b> in the FIG. 2 circuit. However, when the load <b>26</b>′ is unplugged from the circuit, the inverter stops oscillating and the development of high voltages in the inverter is prevented. The fact that no high voltages are generated by the circuit if the lamp is disconnected while the circuit is oscillating is important for safety reasons.</p>
    <p>FIG. 6 illustrates a capacitor <b>52</b>″ connected in series with an inductor <b>51</b>″ through a heater <b>81</b> suitable for heating the toroidal inductors <b>47</b>, <b>49</b> in accordance with the level of output. The load <b>26</b>″ is connected across the series combination of the capacitor <b>52</b>″ and the toroid heater. The heater <b>81</b> is preferably designed to controllably heat the toroidal saturable inductors in order to decrease their saturation flux limit and hence their saturation time. The result is to decrease the periodic transistor conduction time and thereby increase the transistor inversion frequency. When a frequency-dependent impedance means, that is, an inductor or a capacitor, is connected in circuit with the AC voltage output of the inverter, change in the transistor inversion frequency will modify the impedance of the frequency-dependent impdance means and correspondingly modify the inverter output. Thus as the level of the output increases, the toroid heater <b>81</b> is correspondingly energized to effect feedback regulation of the output. Further, transistors <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> of the type used in high voltage inverters dissipate heat during periodic transistor conduction. As an alternative, the toroid heater <b>81</b> can use this heat for feedback regulation of the output or control of the temperature of transistors <b>42</b>, <b>43</b>.</p>
    <p>The frequency dependent impedance means may also be used in a circuit to energize a gas discharge lamp at adjustable illumination levels. Adjustment in the inversion frequency of transistors <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> results in control of the magnitude of the AC current supplied to the lamp. This is preferably accomplished where saturable inductors <b>47</b>, <b>49</b> have adjustable flux densities for control of their saturation time.</p>
    <p>FIG. 7 schematically illustrates an alternate form of inverter circuit, shown without the AC to DC power supply connections for simplification. In this Figure, the transistors are connected in parallel rather than in series but the operation is essentially the same as previously described.</p>
    <p>In particular, this circuit comprises a pair of alternately conducting transistors <b>91</b>, <b>92</b>. The emitter terminals of the transistors are connected to a B− line <b>93</b>. A B+ lead <b>94</b> is connected to the center-tap of a transformer <b>96</b>. In order to provide drive current to the transistors <b>91</b>, <b>92</b> for control of their conduction frequency, saturable inductors <b>97</b>, <b>98</b> have secondary windings <b>99</b>, <b>101</b>, respectively, each secondary winding having one end connected to the base of its associated transistor; the other ends are connected to a common terminal <b>102</b>. One end of transformer <b>96</b> is connected to the collector of transistor <b>91</b> through a winding <b>103</b> on inductor <b>98</b> in turn connected in series with a winding <b>104</b> on inductor <b>97</b>. Likewise, the other end of transformer <b>96</b> is connected to the collector of transistor <b>92</b> through a winding <b>106</b> on inductor <b>97</b> in series with another winding <b>107</b> on inductor <b>98</b>.</p>
    <p>The B+ terminal is connected to terminal <b>102</b> through a bias resistor <b>108</b>. A bias capacitor <b>109</b> connects terminal <b>102</b> to the B− lead <b>93</b>. This resistor and capacitor serve the same function as resistors <b>58</b>, <b>59</b> and capacitors <b>56</b>, <b>57</b> in the FIG. 2 circuit.</p>
    <p>The bases of transistors <b>91</b>, <b>92</b> are connected by diodes <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, respectively, to a common Zener diode <b>113</b> in turn connected to the B− lead <b>93</b>. The common Zener diode <b>113</b> serves the same function as individual Zener diodes <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> in FIG. <b>2</b>.</p>
    <p>Shunt diodes <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> are connected across the collector-emitter terminals of transistors <b>91</b>, <b>92</b>, respectively. A capacitor <b>117</b> connecting the collectors of transistors <b>91</b>, <b>92</b> restrains the rate of voltage rise on the collectors in a manner similar to the collector-emitter capacitor <b>68</b> in FIG. <b>2</b>.</p>
    <p>Inductive-capacitive loading of the FIG. 7 inverter is accomplished by a capacitor <b>118</b> connected in series with with an inductor <b>119</b>, the combination being connected across the collectors of the transistors <b>91</b>, <b>92</b>. A load <b>121</b> is connected across the capacitor <b>118</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 8 illustrates how an inverter loaded with a series capacitor <b>122</b> and inductor <b>123</b> can be used to energize a “rapid-start” fluorescent lamp <b>124</b> (the details of the inverter circuit being omitted for simplication). The lamp <b>124</b> has a pair of cathodes <b>126</b>, <b>127</b> connected across the capacitor <b>122</b> for supply of operating voltage in a manner identical to that previously described. In addition, the inductor <b>123</b> comprises a pair of magnetically-coupled auxiliary windings <b>128</b>, <b>129</b> for electrically heating the cathodes <b>126</b>, <b>127</b>, respectively. A small capacitor <b>131</b> is connected in series with lamp <b>124</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 9 illustrates the very same circuit arrangement as that of FIG. 8 except that the auxiliary windings <b>128</b>, <b>129</b> are only loosely coupled to the inductor <b>123</b>, thereby providing for a manifest limitation on the amount of current that can be drawn from each auxiliary winding in case it were to be accidentally short-circuited.</p>
    <p>FIG. 10 also illustrates the very same circuit arrangement as that of FIG. 8 except that the cathodes <b>126</b>, <b>127</b> are connected with their respective auxiliary windings <b>128</b>, <b>129</b> by way of nonlinear current-limiting means <b>132</b> and <b>133</b>, respectively.</p>
    <p>In FIG. 10, the non-linear current-limiting means <b>132</b>, <b>133</b> are shown as being two (small) incandescent lamps. However, other types of non-linear resistance means could be used as well.</p>
    <p>Both the FIG. 9 circuit and the FIG. 10 circuit serve the same basic purpose; which is that of preventing damage to the ballast circuit (such as that if FIG. 2) in case the leads used for connecting to one of the lamp cathodes <b>126</b>, <b>127</b> were to be accidentally shorted. This damage prevention is accomplished by providing for manifest limitation of the maximum amount of current that can be drawn from each one of the auxiliary windings <b>128</b>, <b>129</b>. In the circuit of FIG. 9, this manifest limitation is accomplished by having the auxiliary windings <b>128</b>, <b>129</b> couple sufficiently loosely to the main inductor <b>123</b>—such as by providing a magnetic shunt between inductor <b>123</b> and the auxiliary windings—thereby correspondingly limiting the degree of impact resulting from an accidental short circuit. Such a short circuit would result in a net reduction in the effective inductance value of the tank inductor <b>123</b>; which net reduction in inductance may in turn cause a precipitous increase in the magnitude of the reactive current drawn from the inverter by the series-connected inductor <b>123</b> and capacitor <b>122</b>, thereby causing damage to the inverter.</p>
    <p>Additional Explanations and Comments</p>
    <p>(a) With reference to FIGS. 2 and 5, adjustment of the amount of power supplied to load <b>26</b>′, and thereby the amount of light provided by lamp <b>71</b>, may be accomplished by applying a voltage of adjustable magnitude to input terminals IP1 and IP2 of the Toroid Heater; which is thermally coupled with the toroidal ferrite cores of saturable transformers <b>47</b>, <b>49</b>.</p>
    <p>(b) With commonly available components, inverter circuit <b>24</b> of FIG. 2 can be made to operate efficiently at any frequency between a few kHz to perhaps as high as 50 kHz. However, for various well-known reasons (i.e., eliminating audible noise, minimizing physical size, and maximizing efficiency), the frequency actually chosen is in the range of 20 to 40 kHz.</p>
    <p>(c) The fluorescent lighting unit of FIG. 1 could be made in such manner as to permit fluorescent lamp <b>11</b> to be disconnectable from its base <b>12</b> and ballasting means <b>16</b>. However, if powered with normal line voltage without its lamp load connected, frequency-converting power supply and ballasting circuit <b>16</b> is apt to self-destruct.</p>
    <p>To avoid such self-destruction, arrangements can readily be made whereby the very act of removing the load automatically establishes a situation that prevents the possible destruction of the power supply and ballasting means. For instance, with the tank capacitor (<b>52</b>) being permanently connected with the lamp load (<b>11</b>)—thereby automatically being removed whenever the lamp is removed—the inverter circuit is protected from self-destruction.</p>
    <p>(d) At frequencies above a few kHz, the load represented by a fluorescent lamp—once it is ignited—is substantially resistive. Thus, with the voltage across lamp <b>11</b> being of a substantially sinusoidal waveform (as indicated in FIG. <b>3</b> <i>d</i>), the current through the lamp will also be substantially sinusoidal in waveshape.</p>
    <p>(e) In the fluorescent lamp unit of FIG. 1, fluorescent lamp <b>11</b> is connected with power supply and ballasting circuit <b>16</b> in the exact same manner as is load <b>26</b> connected with the circuit of FIG. <b>2</b>. That is, it is connected in parallel with the tank capacitor (<b>52</b>) of the L-C series-resonant circuit. As is conventional in instant-start fluorescent lamps—such as lamp <b>11</b> of FIG. <b>1</b>—the two terminals from each cathode are shorted together, thereby to constitute a situation where each cathode effectively is represented by only a single terminal. However, it is not necessary that the two terminals from each cathode be shorted together; in which case—for instant-start operation—connection from a lamp's power supply and ballasting means need only be made with one of the terminals of each cathode.</p>
    <p>(f) with respect to the circuit arrangement of FIG. 9, in situations where the tank inductor <b>123</b> includes a ferrite magnetic core having an air gap, one particularly cost-effective way of accomplishing the indicated loose coupling between the tank inductor <b>123</b> and the auxiliary windings <b>128</b>, <b>129</b> is that of arranging for the auxiliary windings to be placed in the air gap in such a manner that they each couple only with part of the magnetic flux crossing the air gap.</p>
    <p>(g) in FIG. 1, the compact screw-in fluorescent lamp has a longitudinal central axis penetrating through the center of the bottom of base <b>19</b> (i.e., at the point where lead <b>18</b> is connected), passing up centrally between the two legs of lamp <b>11</b>, and emerging at the center of the very top of lamp <b>11</b>.</p>
    <p>(h) In FIG. 1, as a skilled artisan would perceive by direct inspection, the visible parts are drawn to scale. Thus, for instance:</p>
    <p>(i) the height and width (i.e., diameter) of screw-base <b>19</b> are in proper proportion to those of an actual screw-base on an ordinary household incandescent lamp;</p>
    <p>(ii) the diameter of the individual straight legs of the folded fluorescent lamp <b>11</b> are shown in proportion to the diameter of the screw-base;</p>
    <p>(iii) the diameter of the bent portion connecting the top parts of the two straight lamp legs is shown in proper proportion to the diameter of the lamp legs; and</p>
    <p>(iv) the distance between the two straight lamp legs is shown in proper proportion to the diameter of those lamp legs.</p>
    <p>Of course, for a screw-in fluorescent lamp to have maximum utility, it is imperative that it has dimensions sufficiently compact to permit it to be conveniently used in most places where an incandescent lamp would ordinarily be used. Thus, it is important that its maximum diameter not be any larger than those of an ordinary household incandescent lamp (whose maximum diameter is typically about twice that of its screw-base). The screw-in fluorescent lamp depicted in FIG. 1 clearly satisfies those requirements.</p>
