In one embodiment, a power supply controller for switched mode power supply includes a drain terminal, a source terminal, a control terminal and a multi-function terminal. The multi-function terminal may be configured in a plurality of ways providing any one or some of a plurality of functions including on/off control, external current limit adjustments, under-voltage detection, over-voltage detection and maximum duty cycle adjustment. The operation of the multi-function terminal varies depending on whether a positive or negative current flows through the multi-function terminal. A short-circuit to ground from the multi-function terminal enables the power supply controller. A short-circuit to a supply voltage from the multi-function terminal disables the power supply controller. The current limit of an internal power switch of the power supply controller may be adjusted by externally setting a negative current from the multi-function terminal. The multi-function terminal may also be coupled to the input DC line voltage of the power supply through a resistance to detect an under-voltage condition, an over-voltage condition and/or adjust the maximum duty cycle of power supply controller. Synchronization of the oscillator of the power supply controller may also be realized by switching the multi-function terminal to power or ground at the desired times.</div>

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>The present invention relates generally to power supplies and, more specifically, the present invention relates to a switched mode power supply controller.</p>
    <p>2. Background Information</p>
    <p>Electronic devices use power to operate. Switched mode power supplies are commonly used due to their high efficiency and good output regulation to power many of today's electronic devices. In a known switched mode power supply, a low frequency (e.g. 50 Hz or 60 Hz mains frequency), high voltage alternating current (AC) is converted to high voltage direct current (DC) with a diode rectifier and capacitor. The high voltage DC is then converted to high frequency (e.g. 30 to 300 kHz) AC, using a switched mode power supply control circuit. This high frequency, high voltage AC is applied to a transformer to transform the voltage, usually to a lower voltage, and to provide safety isolation. The output of the transformer is rectified to provide a regulated DC output, which may be used to power an electronic device. The switched mode power supply control circuit provides usually output regulation by sensing the output controlling it in a closed loop.</p>
    <p>A switched mode power supply may include an integrated circuit power supply controller coupled in series with a primary winding of the transformer. Energy is transferred to a secondary winding from the primary winding in a manner controlled by the power supply controller to provide the clean and steady source of power at the DC output. The transformer of a switched mode power supply may also include another winding called a bias or feedback winding. The bias winding provides the operating power for the power supply controller and in some cases it also provides a feedback or control signal to the power supply controller. In some switched mode power supplies, the feedback or control signal can come through an opto-coupler from a sense circuit coupled to the DC output. The feedback or control signal may be used to modulate a duty cycle of a switching waveform generated by the power supply controller or may be used to disable some of the cycles of the switching waveform generated by the power supply controller to control the DC output voltage.</p>
    <p>A power supply designer may desire to configure the power supply controller of a switched mode power supply in a variety of different ways, depending on for example the particular application and/or operating conditions. For instance, there may be one application in which the power supply designer would like the power supply controller to have one particular functionality and there may be another application in which the power supply designer would like the power supply controller to have another particular functionality. It would be convenient for power supply designer to be able to use the same integrated power supply controller for these different functions.</p>
    <p>In order to provide the specific functions to the power supply controller, additional pins or electrical terminals are added for each function to the integrated circuit power supply controllers. Consequently, each additional function generally translates into an additional pin on the power supply controller chip, which translates into increased costs and additional external components. Another consequence of providing additional functionality to power supply controllers is that there is sometimes a substantial increase in power consumption by providing the additional functionality.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Power supply controller methods and apparatuses are disclosed. In one embodiment, a power supply controller circuit is described including a current input circuit coupled to receive a current. In one embodiment, the current input circuit is to generate an enable/disable signal in response to the current. The power supply controller is to activate and deactivate the power supply in response to the enable/disable signal. In another embodiment, a current limit of a power switch of the power supply controller is adjusted in response to the current. In yet another embodiment, a maximum duty cycle of the power switch of the power supply is adjusted in response to the current. Additional features and benefits of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description, figures and claims set forth below.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading> <p>A method and an apparatus providing a multi-function terminal in a power supply controller is disclosed. In the following description, numerous specifically details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one having ordinary skill in the art that the specific detail need not be employed to practice the present invention. In other instances, well-known materials or methods have not been described in detail in order to avoid obscuring the present invention.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of the present invention, a power supply controller is provided with the functionality of being able to remotely turn on and off the power supply. In another embodiment, the power supply controller is provided with the functionality of being able to externally set the current limit of a power switch in the power supply controller, which makes it easier to prevent saturation of the transformer reducing transformer size and cost. Externally settable current limit also allows the maximum power output to be kept constant over a wide input range reducing the cost of components that would otherwise have to handle the excessive power at high input voltages. In yet another embodiment, the power supply controller is provided with the functionality of being able to detect an under-voltage condition in the input line voltage of the power supply so that the power supply can be shutdown gracefully without any glitches on the output. In still another embodiment, the power supply controller is provided with the functionality of being able to detect an over-voltage condition in the input line voltage of the power supply so that the power supply can be shut down under this abnormal condition. This allows the power supply to handle much higher surge voltages due to the absence of reflected voltage and switching transients on the power switch in the power supply controller. In another embodiment, the power supply controller is provided with the functionality of being able to limit the maximum duty cycle of a switching waveform generated by a power supply controller to control the DC output of the power supply. In so doing, saturation of the transformer during power up is reduced and the excess power capability at high input voltages is safely limited. Increased duty cycle at low DC input voltages also allows for smaller input filter capacitance. Thus, this feature results in cost savings on many components in the power supply including the transformer. In yet another embodiment, some or all of the above functions are provided with a single multi-function terminal in the power supply controller. That is, in one embodiment, a plurality of additional functions are provided to power supply controller without the consequence of adding a corresponding plurality of additional terminals or pins to the integrated circuit package of the power supply controller. In one embodiment, one or some of the above functions are available when positive current flows into the multi-function terminal. In another embodiment, one or some of the above functions are available when negative current flows out from the multi-function terminal. In one embodiment, the voltage at the multi-function terminal is fixed at a particular value depending on whether positive current flows into the multi-function terminal or whether negative current flows out from the multi-function terminal.</p>
    <p>The multi-function features listed above not only save cost of many components and improve power supply performance but also, they save many components that would otherwise be required if these features were implemented externally.</p>
    <p>FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating one embodiment of a power supply <b>101</b> including a power supply controller <b>139</b> having a multi-function terminal <b>149</b> in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. As illustrated, power supply <b>101</b> includes an AC mains input <b>103</b>, which is configured to receive an AC voltage input. A diode rectifier <b>105</b> is coupled to AC mains input to rectify the AC voltage. Capacitor <b>107</b> is coupled to diode rectifier <b>105</b> to convert the rectified AC into a steady DC line voltage <b>109</b>, which is coupled to a primary winding <b>111</b> of a transformer. Zener diode <b>117</b> and diode <b>119</b> are coupled across primary winding <b>111</b> to provide clamp circuitry.</p>
    <p>As illustrated in FIG. 1, primary winding <b>111</b> is coupled to a drain terminal <b>141</b> of power supply controller <b>139</b>. Power supply controller <b>139</b> includes a power switch <b>147</b> coupled between the drain terminal <b>141</b> and a source terminal <b>143</b>, which is coupled to ground. When power switch <b>147</b> is turned on, current flows through primary winding <b>111</b> of the transformer. When current flows through primary winding <b>111</b>, energy is stored in the transformer. When power switch <b>147</b> is turned off, current does not flow through primary winding <b>111</b> and the energy stored in the transformer is transferred to secondary winding <b>113</b> and bias winding <b>115</b>.</p>
    <p>A DC output voltage is produced at DC output <b>125</b> through diode <b>121</b> and capacitor <b>123</b>. Zener diode <b>127</b>, resistor <b>129</b> and opto-coupler <b>131</b> form feedback circuitry or regulator circuitry to produce a feedback signal received at a control terminal <b>145</b> of the power supply controller <b>139</b>. The feedback or control signal is used to regulate or control the voltage at DC output <b>125</b>. As the voltage across DC output <b>125</b> rises above a threshold voltage determined by Zener diode <b>127</b>, resistor <b>129</b> and opto-coupler <b>131</b>, additional feedback current flows into control terminal <b>145</b>. In one embodiment, control terminal <b>145</b> also provides a supply voltage for circuitry of power supply controller <b>139</b> through bias winding <b>115</b>, diode <b>133</b>, capacitor <b>135</b> and capacitor <b>137</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 1, power supply controller <b>139</b> includes a multi-function terminal <b>149</b>, which in one embodiment enables power supply controller <b>139</b> to provide one or a plurality of different functions, depending on how multi-function terminal <b>149</b> is configured. Some examples of how multi-function terminal <b>149</b> may be configured are shown in FIGS. 2A through 2F.</p>
    <p>For instance, FIG. 2A is a diagram illustrating one embodiment of a power supply controller <b>139</b> including a resistor <b>201</b> coupled between the multi-function terminal <b>149</b> and the source terminal <b>143</b>. In one embodiment, the source terminal <b>143</b> is coupled to ground. In one embodiment, the voltage at multi-function terminal <b>149</b> is fixed when negative current flows from multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. In one embodiment, the negative current that flows through resistor <b>201</b> is used to set externally the current limit of power switch <b>147</b>. Thus, the power supply designer can choose a particular resistance for resistor <b>201</b> to set externally the current limit of power switch <b>147</b>. In one embodiment, resistor <b>201</b> may be a variable resistor, a binary weighted chain of resistors or the like. In such embodiment, the current limit of power switch <b>147</b> may be adjusted externally by varying the resistance of resistor <b>201</b>. In one embodiment, the current limit of power switch <b>147</b> is directly proportional to the negative current flowing through resistor <b>201</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 2B is a diagram illustrating another embodiment of a power supply controller <b>139</b> including a switch <b>203</b> coupled between multi-function terminal <b>149</b> and source terminal <b>143</b>. In one embodiment, source terminal <b>143</b> is coupled to ground. In one embodiment, power supply controller <b>139</b> switches power switch <b>147</b> when multi-function terminal <b>149</b> is coupled to ground through switch <b>203</b>. In one embodiment, power supply controller <b>139</b> does not switch power switch <b>147</b> when multi-function terminal <b>149</b> is disconnected from ground through switch <b>203</b>. In particular, when an adequate amount of negative current flows from multi-function terminal <b>149</b>, power supply <b>101</b> is enabled. When substantially no current flows from multi-function terminal <b>149</b>, power supply <b>101</b> is disabled. In one embodiment, the amount of current that flows from multi-function terminal <b>149</b> to ground through switch <b>203</b> is limited. Thus, in one embodiment, even if multi-function terminal <b>149</b> is short-circuited to ground through switch <b>203</b>, the amount of current flowing from multi-function terminal <b>149</b> to ground is limited to a safe amount.</p>
    <p>FIG. 2C is a diagram illustrating yet another embodiment of a power supply controller <b>139</b> including resistor <b>201</b> and switch <b>203</b> coupled in series between multi-function terminal <b>149</b> and source terminal <b>143</b>, which in one embodiment is ground. The configuration illustrated in FIG. 2C combines the functions illustrated and described in connection with FIGS. 2A and 2B above. That is, the configuration illustrated in FIG. 2C illustrates a power supply controller <b>139</b> having external adjustment of the current limit of power switch <b>147</b>, through the selection of the resistance for resistor <b>201</b>, and on/off functionality through switch <b>203</b>. When switch <b>203</b> is on, power supply controller <b>139</b> will switch power switch <b>147</b> with a current limit set by resistor <b>201</b>. When switch <b>203</b> is off, power supply controller <b>139</b> will not switch power switch <b>147</b> and power supply <b>101</b> will be disabled.</p>
    <p>FIG. 2D is a diagram illustrating still another embodiment of a power supply controller <b>139</b> including a resistor <b>205</b> coupled between the line voltage <b>109</b> and multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. Referring briefly back to FIG. 1 above, DC line voltage <b>109</b> is generated at capacitor <b>107</b> and is input to the primary winding <b>111</b> of the transformer of power supply <b>101</b>. Referring back the FIG. 2D, in one embodiment, multi-function terminal <b>149</b> is substantially fixed at a particular voltage when positive current flows into multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. Therefore, the amount of positive current flowing through resistor <b>205</b> into multi-function terminal <b>149</b> is representative of line voltage <b>109</b>, which is input to the primary winding <b>111</b>. Since the positive current flowing through resistor <b>205</b> into multi-function terminal <b>149</b> represents the line voltage <b>109</b>, power supply controller <b>139</b> can use this positive current to sense an under-voltage condition in line voltage <b>109</b> in one embodiment. An under-voltage condition exists when the line voltage <b>109</b> is below a particular under-voltage threshold value. In one embodiment, if a line under-voltage condition is detected, power switch <b>147</b> is not switched by power supply controller <b>139</b> until the under-voltage condition is removed.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, power supply controller <b>139</b> can use the positive current flowing through resistor <b>205</b> into multi-function terminal <b>149</b> to detect an over-voltage condition in line voltage <b>109</b>. An over-voltage condition when line voltage <b>109</b> rises above a particular over-voltage threshold value. In one embodiment, if a line over-voltage condition is detected, power switch <b>147</b> is not switched by power supply controller <b>139</b> until the over-voltage condition is removed.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, power supply controller <b>139</b> can also use the positive current flowing through resistor <b>205</b> and multi-function terminal <b>149</b> to detect for increases or decreases in line voltage <b>109</b>. As line voltage <b>109</b> increases, for a given fixed maximum duty cycle, the maximum power available to secondary winding <b>113</b> in power supply <b>101</b> of FIG. 1 usually increases. As line voltage <b>109</b> decreases, less power is available to secondary winding <b>113</b> in power supply <b>101</b>. In most cases, the excess power available at the DC output <b>125</b> is undesirable under overload conditions due to high currents that need to be handled by components. In some instances, it is also desirable to increase the maximum power available to DC output <b>125</b> at low input DC voltages to save on cost of the input filter capacitor <b>107</b>. Higher duty cycle at low DC input voltage allows lower input voltage operation for a given output power. This allows larger ripple voltage on capacitor <b>107</b>, which translates to a lower value capacitor. Therefore, in one embodiment, power supply controller <b>139</b> adjusts the maximum duty cycle of a switching waveform used to control or regulate power switch <b>147</b> in response to increases or decreases in line voltage <b>109</b>. In one embodiment, the maximum duty cycle of the switching waveform used to control power switch <b>147</b> is inversely proportional to the line voltage <b>109</b>. As mentioned earlier, reducing the duty cycle with increasing input DC voltage has many advantages. For instance, it reduces the value and hence the cost of capacitor <b>107</b>. In addition, it limits excess power at high line voltages reducing the cost of the clamp circuit (<b>117</b>, <b>119</b>), the transformer and the output rectifier <b>121</b> due to reduced maximum power ratings on these components.</p>
    <p>It is appreciated that since only a single resistor <b>201</b> to ground, or a single resistor <b>205</b> to line voltage <b>109</b>, is utilized for implementing some of the functions of power supply controller <b>139</b>, a power savings is realized. For instance, if a resistor divider were to be coupled between power and ground, and a voltage output of the resistor divider coupled to a terminal of power supply controller <b>139</b> were to be used, current would continuously flow through both the resistor divider and into a sensor terminal of the power supply controller. This would result in increased power consumption. However in one embodiment of the power supply controller <b>139</b>, only the single resistor <b>201</b> to ground or single resistor <b>205</b> to line voltage <b>109</b> is utilized, thereby eliminating the need for a current to flow through both the resistor divider and into power supply controller <b>139</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 2E is a diagram illustrating yet another embodiment of a power supply controller <b>139</b> including resistor <b>205</b>, as described above, coupled between the line voltage <b>109</b> and multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. FIG. 2E also includes a switch <b>207</b> coupled between control terminal <b>145</b> and multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. In one embodiment, resistor <b>205</b> provides the same functionality as discussed above in connection with FIG. <b>2</b>D. Therefore, when switch <b>207</b> is switched off, the configuration illustrated in FIG. 2E is identical to the configuration described above in connection with FIG. <b>2</b>D.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, control terminal <b>145</b> provides a supply voltage for power supply controller <b>139</b> in addition to providing a feedback or control signal to power supply controller <b>139</b> from DC output <b>125</b>. As a result, in one embodiment, switch <b>207</b> provides in effect a switchable low resistance connection between a supply voltage (control terminal <b>145</b>) and multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. In one embodiment, the maximum positive current that can flow into multi-function terminal <b>149</b> is limited. Therefore, in one embodiment, even when switch <b>207</b> provides, in effect, a short-circuit connection from a supply voltage, the positive current that flows into multi-function terminal <b>149</b> is limited to a safe amount. However, in one embodiment, the positive current that does flow through switch <b>207</b>, when activated, into multi-function terminal <b>149</b> triggers an over-voltage condition. As discussed above, power supply <b>139</b> discontinues switching power switch <b>147</b> during an over-voltage condition until the condition is removed. Therefore, switch <b>207</b> provides on/off functionality for power supply controller <b>139</b>. When switch <b>207</b> is the activated, the low resistance path to control terminal <b>145</b> is removed and the positive current flowing into multi-function terminal <b>149</b> is limited to the current that flows from line voltage <b>109</b> through resistor <b>205</b>. Assuming that neither an under-voltage condition nor an over-voltage condition exists, power supply controller <b>139</b> will resume switching power switch <b>147</b>, thereby re-enabling power supply <b>101</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 2F is a diagram illustrating another embodiment of a power supply controller <b>139</b> using current mode control to regulate the current limit of the power supply. As shown, resistor <b>201</b> is coupled between the multi-function terminal <b>149</b> and the source terminal <b>143</b> and the transistor <b>209</b> of an opto-coupler coupled between multi-function terminal <b>149</b> and a bias supply, such as for example control terminal <b>145</b>. Similar to FIG. 2A, the negative current that flows out from multi-function terminal <b>149</b> is used to set externally the current limit of power switch <b>147</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in Figure in FIG. 2F, the current limit adjustment function can be used for controlling the power supply output by feeding a feedback signal from the output of the power supply into multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 2F, the current limit is adjusted in a closed loop to regulate the output of the power supply (known as current mode control) by adding the opto-coupler output between multi-function terminal <b>149</b> and the bias supply.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, the power supply controller configurations described in connection with FIGS. 2A through 2F all utilize the same multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. Stated differently, in one embodiment, the same power supply controller <b>139</b> may be utilized in all of the configurations described. Thus, the presently described power controller <b>139</b> provides a power supply designer with added flexibility. As a result, a power supply designer may implement more than one of the above functions at the same time using the presently described power supply controller <b>139</b>. In addition, the same functionality may be implemented in more than one way. For example, power supply <b>101</b> can be remotely turned on and off using either power or ground. In particular, the power supply <b>101</b> can be turned on and off by switching to and from the control terminal (supply terminal for the power supply controller) using the over-voltage detection feature, or by switching to and from ground using the on/off circuitry.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 2A though <b>2</b>F provide just a few examples of use of the multi-function terminal. A person skilled in the art will find many other configurations for use of the multifunction pin. The uses for the multi-function terminal, are therefore, not limited to the few examples shown.</p>
    <p>It is worthwhile to note that different functions of the presently described power supply controller <b>139</b> may be utilized at different times during different modes of operation of power supply controller <b>139</b>. For instance, some features may be implemented during startup operation, other functions may be implemented during normal operation, other functions may be implemented during fault conditions, while still other functions may be implemented during standby operation. Indeed, it is appreciated that a power supply designer may implement other circuit configurations to use with a power supply controller <b>139</b> in accordance with teachings of the present invention. The configurations illustrated in FIGS. 2A through 2F are provided simply for explanation purposes.</p>
    <p>FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating one embodiment of a power supply controller <b>139</b> in accordance with teachings of the present invention. As shown in the embodiment illustrated, power supply controller <b>139</b> includes a current input circuit <b>302</b>, which in one embodiment serves as multi-function circuitry. In one embodiment, current input circuit <b>302</b> includes a negative current input circuit <b>304</b> and a positive current input circuit <b>306</b>. In one embodiment, negative current input circuit <b>304</b> includes negative current sensor <b>301</b>, on/off circuitry <b>309</b> and external current limit adjuster <b>313</b>. In one embodiment, positive current input circuit <b>306</b> includes positive current sensor <b>305</b>, under-voltage comparator <b>317</b>, over-voltage comparator <b>321</b> and maximum duty cycle adjuster <b>325</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 3, negative current sensor <b>301</b> and positive current sensor <b>305</b> are coupled to multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. In one embodiment, negative current sensor <b>301</b> generates a negative current sense signal <b>303</b> and positive current sensor generates a positive current sense signal <b>307</b>. For purposes of this description, a negative current may be interpreted as current that flows out of multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. Positive current may be interpreted as current that flows into multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. In one embodiment, on/off circuitry <b>309</b> is coupled to receive negative current sense signal <b>303</b>. External current limit adjuster <b>313</b> is coupled to receive negative current sense signal <b>303</b>.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, under-voltage comparator <b>317</b> is coupled to receive positive current sense signal <b>307</b>. Over-voltage comparator <b>321</b> is coupled to receive positive current sense signal <b>307</b>. As discussed earlier, both under-voltage and over-voltage comparators also function as on/off circuits. Maximum duty cycle adjuster <b>325</b> is also coupled to receive positive current sense signal <b>307</b>.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, on/off circuitry <b>309</b> generates an on/off signal <b>311</b>, under-voltage comparator <b>317</b> generates an under-voltage signal <b>319</b> an over-voltage comparator <b>321</b> generates an over-voltage signal <b>323</b>. As shown in the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3, enable/disable logic <b>329</b> is coupled to receive the on/off signal <b>311</b>, the under-voltage signal <b>319</b> and the over-voltage signal <b>323</b>. The under-voltage and over-voltage signals can also be used for on/off functions as noted earlier.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, enable/disable logic <b>329</b> generates an enable/disable signal <b>331</b>, which is coupled to be received by control circuit <b>333</b>. The control circuit <b>333</b> is also coupled to receive a control signal from control terminal <b>145</b>. In addition, control circuit <b>333</b> is also coupled to receive a drain signal from drain terminal <b>141</b>, a maximum duty cycle adjustment signal <b>327</b> from maximum duty cycle adjuster <b>325</b> and an external current limit adjustment signal <b>315</b> from external current limit adjuster <b>313</b>.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, control circuit <b>333</b> generates a switching waveforms <b>335</b>, which is coupled to be received by power switch <b>147</b>. In one embodiment, power switch <b>147</b> is coupled between drain terminal <b>141</b> and source terminal <b>143</b> to control a current flowing through the primary winding <b>111</b> of power supply <b>101</b>, which is coupled to drain terminal <b>141</b>.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, negative current sensor <b>301</b> senses current that flows out of negative current sensor <b>301</b> through multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. Negative current sense signal <b>303</b> is generated in response to the current that flows from negative current sensor <b>301</b> through multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. In one embodiment, current that flows from negative current sensor <b>301</b> through multi-function terminal <b>149</b> typically flows through an external resistance or switch coupled between multi-function terminal <b>149</b> and ground.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, positive current sensor <b>305</b> senses current that flows into positive current sensor <b>305</b> through multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. Positive current sense signal <b>307</b> is generated in response to the current that flows into positive current sensor <b>305</b> through multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. In one embodiment, current that flows into positive current sensor <b>305</b> through multi-function terminal <b>149</b> typically flows through an external resistance coupled between multi-function terminal <b>149</b> and the DC line voltage <b>109</b> input to the primary winding <b>111</b> of a power supply <b>101</b> and/or another voltage source. In another embodiment the current flows through an external resistance or a switch coupled between the multi-function terminal <b>149</b> and another voltage source. In one embodiment, the line voltage <b>109</b> input to primary winding <b>111</b> is typically a rectified and filtered AC mains signal.</p>
    <p>As mentioned above, in one embodiment, positive current does not flow while negative current flows, and vice versa. In one embodiment, the negative current sensor <b>301</b> and positive current sensor <b>305</b> are designed in such a way that they are not active at the same time. Stated differently, negative current sense signal <b>303</b> is not active at the same time as positive current sense signal <b>307</b> in one embodiment.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, the voltage at multi-function terminal <b>149</b> is fixed at a first level when negative current flows out of power supply controller <b>139</b> from multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. In one embodiment, the first level is selected to be approximately 1.25 volts. In one embodiment, the voltage at multi-function terminal is fixed at a second level when positive current flows into power supply controller <b>139</b> through multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. In one embodiment, the second level is selected to be approximately 2.3 volts.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, on/off circuitry <b>309</b> generates on/off signal <b>311</b> in response to negative current sense signal <b>303</b>. In one embodiment, when the current flowing from multi-function terminal <b>149</b> through an external resistance to ground is less than a predetermined on/off threshold level, on/off circuitry <b>309</b> generates on/off signal <b>311</b> to switch off the power supply <b>101</b>. In one embodiment, when the current flowing from multi-function terminal <b>149</b> is greater than a predetermined on/off threshold level, on/off circuitry <b>309</b> generates on/off signal <b>311</b> to switch on the power supply <b>101</b>. In one embodiment, the magnitude of the on/off threshold level is approximately 40 to 50 microamps, including hysteresis.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, external current limit adjuster <b>313</b> generates external current limit adjustment signal <b>315</b> in response to negative current sense signal <b>303</b>. In one embodiment, when the magnitude of the negative current flowing from multi-function terminal <b>149</b> through an external resistance or switch to ground is below a predetermined level, the current limit adjuster <b>313</b> generates an external current limit adjustment signal to limit the current flowing through power switch <b>147</b>. In one embodiment, when the magnitude of the negative current flowing from multi-function terminal <b>149</b> is below a predetermined level, the current flowing through power switch <b>147</b> is limited to an amount directly proportional to the current flowing out of power supply controller <b>139</b> from multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. In one embodiment, predetermined level is approximately 150 microamps. In one embodiment, if the magnitude of the negative current flowing out of power supply controller <b>139</b> from multi-function terminal <b>149</b> is greater than the predetermined level, the current flowing through power switch <b>147</b> is internally limited or clamped to a fixed safe maximum level. Therefore, the current flowing through power switch <b>147</b> is clamped to a safe value, even when multi-function terminal <b>149</b> is shorted to ground. In one embodiment, the current flowing through power switch <b>147</b> is internally limited or clamped to value of 3 amps.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, since the voltage at multi-function terminal <b>149</b> is fixed at a particular voltage when current flows out of power supply controller <b>139</b> through multi-function terminal <b>149</b>, the current limit through power switch <b>147</b> can be accurately set externally with a single large value, low-cost, resistor externally coupled between multi-function terminal <b>149</b> and ground. By using a large external resistance, the current flowing from multi-function terminal <b>149</b> is relatively small. As mentioned above, the current flowing from multi-function terminal <b>149</b> in one embodiment is in the microamp range. Since the current flowing from multi-function terminal <b>149</b> is relatively small, the amount of power dissipated is also relatively small.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, multi-function terminal <b>149</b> is coupled to the DC line voltage <b>109</b> input to the primary winding <b>111</b> through an external resistance. In one embodiment, the amount of current flowing into multi-function terminal <b>149</b> represents the DC input line voltage to the power supply <b>101</b>. In one embodiment, under-voltage comparator <b>317</b> generates under-voltage signal <b>319</b> in response to the resulting positive current sense signal <b>307</b>. In one embodiment, when the current flowing into multi-function terminal <b>149</b> rises above a first predetermined threshold, under-voltage comparator <b>317</b> generates under-voltage signal <b>319</b> to enable the power supply. In one embodiment, when the current flowing into multi-function terminal <b>149</b> falls below a second predetermined threshold, under-voltage comparator <b>317</b> generates under-voltage signal <b>319</b> to disable the power supply. In one embodiment, the first predetermined threshold is greater than the second predetermined threshold to provide hysteresis. By providing hysteresis or a hysteretic threshold, unwanted switching on and off of the power supply <b>101</b> resulting from noise or ripple is reduced. In one embodiment, the first predetermined threshold is approximately 50 microamps and the second predetermined threshold is approximately 0 microamps. In another embodiment, a hysteretic threshold is not utilized. Thus the hysteresis is greater than or equal to zero.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, over-voltage comparator <b>321</b> generates over-voltage signal <b>323</b> in response to the positive current sense signal <b>307</b>. In one embodiment, when the current flowing into multi-function terminal <b>149</b> rises above a third predetermined threshold, over-voltage comparator <b>321</b> generates over-voltage signal <b>323</b> to disable the power supply. In one embodiment, when the current flowing into multi-function terminal <b>149</b> falls below a fourth predetermined threshold, over-voltage comparator <b>321</b> generates over-voltage signal <b>323</b> to enable the power supply. In one embodiment, the third predetermined threshold is greater than the fourth predetermined threshold to provide hysteresis. By providing hysteresis or a hysteretic threshold, unwanted switching on and off of the power supply resulting from noise is reduced. In one embodiment, the third predetermined threshold is approximately 225 microamps and the fourth predetermined threshold is approximately 215 microamps. In one embodiment, the third and fourth predetermined thresholds are selected to be approximately four to five times greater than the first predetermined threshold discussed above for an AC mains input <b>103</b> of approximately 85 volts to 265 volts AC. In another embodiment, a hysteretic threshold is not utilized. Thus the hysteresis is greater than or equal to zero.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, power switch <b>147</b> is able to tolerate higher voltages when not switching. When the power supply is disabled, power switch <b>147</b> does not switch. Therefore, it is appreciated that over-voltage comparator <b>321</b> helps to protect the power supply <b>101</b> from unwanted input power surges by disabling the power switch <b>147</b>.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, over-voltage and under-voltage comparators <b>321</b> and <b>317</b> may also be used for on/off functionality, similar to on/off circuitry <b>309</b>. In particular, multi-function terminal <b>149</b> may be switchably coupled to a on/off control signal source to provide a positive current that flows into multi-function terminal <b>149</b> that cross the under-voltage or over-voltage thresholds (going above the third or below the fourth predetermined thresholds). For example, when the positive current through the multifunction pin crosses above the first predetermined threshold of the under-voltage comparator <b>317</b>, the power supply will be enabled and when the positive current goes below the second predetermined threshold of the under-voltage comparator <b>317</b>, the power supply is disabled. Similarly, when the positive current through the multifunction pin crosses above the third predetermined threshold of the over-voltage comparator <b>321</b>, the power supply will be disabled and when the positive current goes below the fourth predetermined threshold of the over-voltage comparator <b>321</b>, the power supply is enabled.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, maximum duty cycle adjuster <b>325</b> generates maximum duty cycle adjustment signal <b>327</b> in response to the positive current sense signal <b>307</b>. In one embodiment, maximum duty cycle adjustment signal <b>327</b>, which is received by control circuit <b>333</b>, is used to adjust the maximum duty cycle of the switching waveform <b>335</b> used to control power switch <b>147</b>. In one embodiment, the maximum duty cycle determines how long a power switch <b>147</b> can be on during each cycle. For example, if the maximum duty cycle is 50 percent, the power switch <b>147</b> can be on for a maximum of 50 percent of each cycle.</p>
    <p>Referring briefly for example to the power supply <b>101</b> of FIG. 1, while power switch <b>147</b> is on, power is stored in the transformer core through the primary winding <b>111</b>. While the power switch <b>147</b> is off, power is delivered from the transformer core to the secondary winding of the transformer in power supply <b>101</b>. To delivery a given power level, for a lower DC input voltage <b>109</b>, a higher duty cycle is required and for a higher DC input voltage <b>109</b>, a lower duty cycle is required. In one embodiment of the present invention, maximum duty cycle adjuster <b>325</b> decreases the maximum duty cycle of power switch <b>147</b> in response to increases in the DC input voltage <b>109</b>. In one embodiment, maximum duty cycle adjuster <b>325</b> increases the maximum duty cycle of power switch <b>147</b> in response to decreases in the DC input voltage <b>109</b>. Stated differently, the maximum duty cycle is adjusted to be inversely proportional to the current that flows into multi-function terminal <b>149</b> in one embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p>Referring back to FIG. 3, in one embodiment, the maximum duty cycle is adjusted within a range of 33 percent to 75 percent based on the amount of positive current that flows into multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. In one embodiment, maximum duty cycle adjuster <b>325</b> does not begin to decrease the maximum duty cycle until the amount of current that flows into multi-function terminal <b>149</b> rises above a threshold value. In one embodiment, that threshold value is approximately <b>60</b> microamps. In one embodiment, the maximum duty cycle is not adjusted if negative current flows out of multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. In this case, the maximum duty cycle is fixed at 75 percent in one embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, enable/disable logic <b>329</b> receives as input on/off signal <b>311</b>, under-voltage signal <b>319</b> and over-voltage signal <b>323</b>. In one embodiment, if any one of the under-voltage or over-voltage conditions exist, enable/disable logic <b>329</b> disables power supply <b>101</b>. In one embodiment, when the under-voltage and over-voltage conditions are removed, enable/disable logic <b>329</b> enables power supply <b>101</b>. In one embodiment, power supply <b>101</b> may be enabled or disabled by starting and stopping, respectively, the switching waveform <b>335</b> at the beginning of a switching cycle just before the power switch is to be turned on. In one embodiment, enable/disable logic <b>329</b> generates enable/disable signal <b>331</b>, which is received by the oscillator in the control circuit <b>333</b> to start or stop the oscillator at the beginning of a switching cycle of switching waveform <b>335</b>. When enabled the oscillator will start a new on cycle of the switching waveform. When disabled the oscillator will complete the current switching cycle and stop just before the beginning of the next cycle.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, control circuit <b>333</b> generates switching waveform <b>335</b> to control power switch <b>147</b> in response to a current sense signal received from drain terminal <b>141</b>, enable/disable signal <b>331</b>, maximum duty cycle adjustment signal <b>327</b>, a control signal from control terminal <b>145</b> and external current limit adjustment signal <b>315</b>.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, the enable/disable signal can also be used to synchronize the oscillator in the control circuit to an external on/off control signal source having a frequency less than that of the oscillator. The on/off control signal can be input to the multi-function terminal through any of the three paths that generate the enable/disable signal: on/off circuitry <b>309</b>, under-voltage comparator <b>317</b> or over-voltage comparator <b>321</b>. As discussed, enable/disable the oscillator in the control circuit <b>333</b>, in one embodiment, begins a new complete cycle of switching waveform at <b>335</b> using known techniques in response to enable/disable signal <b>331</b>, which represents the on/off control signal at the multi-function input. By turning the on/off control signal “on” at the multi-function input for a fraction of the switching cycle and then “off,” the oscillator is enabled to start a new complete cycle. Therefore, if the external on/off control signal has short “on” pulses at a frequency less than the oscillator in the control circuit, the oscillator will produce a switching cycle each time an on pulse is detected, thus providing a switching waveform that is synchronized to the external frequency.</p>
    <p>In an alternate embodiment shown below in FIG. 7, the enable/disable signal <b>331</b> directly disables or turns off the power switch through the AND gate <b>493</b> when an under-voltage or over-voltage condition exists. In this embodiment, the power switch can be enabled or disabled in the middle of a cycle and consequently, synchronization of the switching waveform through a on/off control signal at the multi-function input is not provided.</p>
    <p>FIG. 4 is a schematic of one embodiment of a power supply controller <b>139</b> in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. As illustrated, negative current sensor <b>301</b> includes a current source <b>401</b> coupled to control terminal <b>145</b>.

    <p>In one embodiment, external current limit adjuster <b>313</b> includes a current source <b>415</b> coupled between control terminal <b>145</b> and the drain of transistor <b>419</b> and the gate and drain of transistor <b>421</b>. The source of transistor <b>419</b> and the source of transistor <b>421</b> are coupled to ground. The gate of transistor <b>419</b> is coupled to receive negative current sense signal <b>303</b>. External current limit adjuster <b>313</b> also includes a current source <b>417</b> coupled between control terminal <b>145</b> and the drain of transistor <b>423</b> and resistor <b>425</b>. The source of transistor <b>423</b> and resistor <b>425</b> are coupled to ground. External current limit adjustment signal <b>315</b> is generated at the drain of transistor <b>423</b>.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, positive current sensor <b>305</b> includes transistor <b>429</b> having a source coupled to multi-function terminal <b>149</b> and the current mirror formed with transistors <b>431</b> and <b>433</b>. In particular, transistor <b>431</b> has a gate and drain coupled to the drain of transistor <b>429</b> and the gate of transistor <b>433</b>. Current source <b>435</b> is coupled between ground and the sources of transistors <b>431</b> and <b>433</b>. The gate of transistor <b>429</b> is coupled to band gap voltage V<sub>BG</sub>.

    <p>Operation of power supply controller <b>139</b> of FIG. 4 is as follows. Beginning with negative current sensor <b>301</b>, the gate of transistor <b>407</b> is fixed at V<sub>BG</sub>+V<sub>TN </sub>in one embodiment to approximately 2.3 volts. As a result, transistor <b>407</b> sets the voltage at multi-function terminal <b>149</b> to V<sub>BG </sub>in one embodiment, which is approximately 1.25 volts, when current is pulled out of multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. This current may be referred to as negative current since the current is being pulled out of power supply controller <b>139</b>. In one embodiment, transistor <b>407</b> is sized such that it operates with a current density resulting in a voltage drop between the gate and source that is close to V<sub>TN</sub>, wherein the V<sub>TN </sub>is the threshold of the N channel transistor <b>407</b>, when negative current flows from multi-function terminal <b>149</b>.</p>
    <p>When an external resistor (not shown) is coupled from multi-function terminal <b>149</b> to ground, the negative current flowing through the external resistor will therefore be V<sub>BG </sub>divided by the value of the external resistor in accordance with Ohm's law. This negative current flowing out from multi-function terminal <b>149</b> passes through transistors <b>403</b> and is mirrored on to transistor <b>405</b>. Current source <b>401</b> limits the negative current sourced by multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. Therefore, even if multi-function terminal <b>149</b> is short-circuited to ground, the current is limited to a current less than the current supplied by current source <b>401</b>. This current is less than the current source <b>401</b> by an amount that flows through the transistor <b>405</b>. In one embodiment, the negative current that can be drawn from the multi-function terminal is limited to 200 microamps by the current source <b>401</b>. In one embodiment, if more negative current than current source <b>401</b> is able to supply is pulled from multi-function terminal <b>149</b>, the voltage at multi-function terminal <b>149</b> collapses to approximately 0 volts.</p>
    <p>The current that flows through transistor <b>403</b> is mirrored to transistor <b>405</b>. The current that flows through transistors <b>405</b> and <b>411</b> is the same since they are coupled in series. Since transistors <b>411</b> and <b>413</b> form a current mirror, the current flowing through transistor <b>413</b> is proportional to the negative current flowing through multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. The current flowing through transistor <b>413</b> is compared to the current provided by current source <b>409</b>. If the current through transistor <b>413</b> is greater than the current supplied by current source <b>409</b>, the signal at the drain of transistor <b>413</b> will go low, which in one embodiment enables the power supply. Indeed, on/off signal <b>311</b> is received at an inverted input of NOR gate <b>445</b>. Thus, when on/off signal <b>311</b> is low, the power supply is enabled. Therefore, by having a negative current greater than a particular threshold value, the power supply of the present invention is enabled in one embodiment. In one embodiment, the magnitude of that particular threshold value is approximately 50 microamps.</p>
    <p>As mentioned above, the current flowing through transistor <b>411</b> is proportional to the negative current flowing out from multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. As illustrated, transistor <b>419</b> also forms a current mirror with transistor <b>411</b>. Therefore, the current flowing through transistor <b>419</b> is proportional to the current flowing through transistor <b>411</b>. The current flowing through transistor <b>421</b> is the difference between the current supplied by current source <b>415</b> and the current flowing through transistor <b>419</b>. For example, assume that the current supplied by current source <b>415</b> is equal to A. Assume further that the current flowing through transistor <b>419</b> is equal to B. In this case, the current flowing through transistor <b>421</b> is equal to A−B.</p>
    <p>As illustrated, transistor <b>423</b> forms a current mirror with transistor <b>421</b>. Therefore, the current flowing through transistor <b>423</b> is proportional to the current flowing through transistor <b>421</b>. Continuing with the example above and assuming further that transistors <b>421</b> and <b>423</b> are equal in size, the current flowing through transistor <b>423</b> is also equal to A−B. Assuming further that current source <b>417</b> supplies a current equal to the current supplied by current source <b>415</b>, which is assumed to be equal to A, then the current flowing through resistor <b>425</b> would be equal to A−(A−B), which is equal to B.</p>
    <p>Therefore, the current flowing through resistor <b>425</b> is proportional to the current flowing through transistor <b>419</b>, which is proportional to the current flowing through transistor <b>411</b>, which is proportional to the negative current flowing out from multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. Note that if the current flowing through transistor <b>419</b> is greater than the current supplied by current source <b>415</b>, the current flowing through transistor <b>421</b> would be zero because the voltage at the drains of transistors <b>419</b> and <b>421</b> would collapse to approximately zero volts. This would result in the current flowing through transistor <b>423</b> to be zero . Thus, the current through resistor <b>425</b> cannot be greater than the current supplied by current source <b>417</b>. However, as long as B is less than A, the current that flows through resistor <b>425</b> is equal to B. If B rises above A, the current that flows through resistor <b>425</b> is equal to A.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, resistor <b>425</b> is fabricated using the same or similar types of processes and diffusions or doped regions used in fabricating power MOSFET <b>495</b>. As a result, the on resistance of resistor <b>425</b> follows or tracks the on resistance of power MOSFET <b>495</b> through varying operating conditions and processing variations.</p>
    <p>The voltage across resistor <b>425</b> is reflected in external current limit adjuster signal <b>315</b>, which is input to the negative input of comparator <b>465</b>. In one embodiment, the negative input of comparator <b>465</b> is the threshold input of comparator <b>465</b>. Therefore, the negative input of comparator <b>465</b> receives a voltage proportional to the negative current flowing out of multi-function terminal <b>149</b> multiplied by the resistance of resistor <b>425</b>.</p>
    <p>The positive input of comparator <b>465</b> is coupled to drain terminal <b>141</b> through resistor <b>461</b> of the voltage divider formed by resistor <b>461</b> and resistor <b>463</b>. Therefore, the positive input of comparator <b>465</b> senses a voltage proportional to the drain current of power MOSFET <b>495</b> multiplied by the on resistance of power MOSFET <b>495</b>.</p>
    <p>When the voltage at the positive terminal of comparator <b>465</b> rises above the voltage provided by external current limit adjuster signal <b>315</b> to the negative terminal of comparator <b>465</b>, the output of comparator <b>465</b> is configured to reset latch <b>491</b> through AND gate <b>487</b> and OR gate <b>489</b>. By resetting latch <b>491</b>, the on portion of a cycle of waveform <b>335</b> received at the gate of power MOSFET <b>495</b> is masked or cut short, which results in turning off power MOSFET <b>495</b> when the amount of current flowing through power switch <b>147</b> rises above the threshold.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, AND gate <b>487</b> also receives input from leading edge blanking delay circuitry <b>485</b>. In one embodiment, leading edge blanking delay circuitry <b>485</b>, using known techniques, temporarily disables current limit detection at the start, or during the leading edge portion, of an on transition of power MOSFET <b>495</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 4, latch <b>491</b> is set at the beginning of each cycle by switching waveform output <b>473</b>. One way that latch <b>491</b> is reset, thereby turning off power MOSFET <b>495</b>, is through the output of comparator <b>465</b>. Another way to reset latch <b>491</b> is through the output of comparator <b>477</b>, which will be discussed below in connection with maximum duty cycle adjuster <b>325</b>.</p>
    <p>With regard to positive current sensor <b>305</b>, the gate of transistor <b>429</b> is coupled to the band gap voltage V<sub>BG</sub>. In one embodiment, transistor <b>429</b> is sized such that it operates with a current density resulting in a drop between the source and gate close to V<sub>TP </sub>which is threshold of the P channel transistor <b>429</b>, when positive current flows into multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. In one embodiment, current that flows into multi-function terminal <b>149</b> is referred to as positive current since the current is being fed into the power supply controller <b>139</b>. As a result, the voltage at multi-function terminal <b>149</b> is fixed at approximately V<sub>BG</sub>+V<sub>TP </sub>when positive current flows into multi-function terminal <b>149</b>.</p>
    <p>The gate voltages on the transistors <b>407</b> and <b>429</b> chosen in the embodiment discussed above are such that only one of transistors <b>407</b> and <b>429</b> are switched on at a time depending on the polarity of the current at the multi-function terminal. Stated differently, if transistor <b>407</b> is on, transistor <b>429</b> is off. If transistor <b>429</b> is on, transistor <b>407</b> is off. As result, if negative current sensor <b>301</b> is on, positive current sensor <b>305</b> is isolated from multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. If positive current sensor <b>305</b> is on, negative current sensor <b>301</b> is isolated from multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. Therefore, if there is negative current flowing through multi-function terminal <b>149</b>, positive current sensor <b>305</b> is disabled. If there is positive current flowing through multi-function terminal <b>149</b>, negative current sensor <b>301</b> is disabled.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, the positive current that flows into transistor <b>429</b> flows through transistor <b>431</b> since they are coupled in series. The positive current through multi-function terminal <b>149</b> flows into and is limited by current source <b>435</b>. In one embodiment, if the positive current through multi-function terminal <b>149</b> is greater than an amount that current source <b>435</b> can sink minus the current in transistor <b>433</b>, then the voltage at multi-function terminal <b>149</b> will rise and is clamped either by the circuitry driving the current or by the standard clamping circuitry that is used for protection purposes on external terminals such as the multi-function terminal, of a power supply controller. As shown, transistors <b>431</b> and <b>433</b> form a current mirror. Therefore, the current flowing through transistor <b>433</b> is proportional to the positive current that flows through transistor <b>431</b>. The current that flows through the transistor <b>433</b> flows to transistor <b>427</b> since they are coupled in series. As shown, the gate of transistor <b>427</b> is coupled to the drain of transistor <b>427</b>, which generates positive current sense signal <b>307</b>.</p>
    <p>Transistors <b>427</b> and <b>437</b> form a current mirror since the gate and drain of transistor <b>427</b> are coupled to the gate of transistor <b>437</b>. Therefore, the current flowing through transistor <b>437</b> is proportional to the current flowing through transistor <b>427</b>, which is proportional to the positive current. Current source <b>439</b> provides a reference current, which is compared to the current that flows through transistor <b>437</b>. If the current flowing through transistor <b>437</b> rises above the current provided by current source <b>439</b>, then the voltage at the drain of transistor <b>437</b>, which is the under-voltage signal <b>319</b>, goes high. When under-voltage signal <b>319</b> goes high and the output of NOR gate <b>445</b> will go low, indicating that there is no under-voltage condition.</p>
    <p>Transistors <b>427</b> and <b>441</b> also form a current mirror since the gate and drain of transistor <b>427</b> are coupled to the gate of transistor <b>441</b>. Therefore, the current flowing through transistor <b>441</b> is proportional to the current flowing through the transistor <b>427</b>, which is proportional to the positive current. Current source <b>443</b> provides a reference current, which is compared to current that flows through transistor <b>441</b>. As long as the current flowing through transistor <b>441</b> stays below the current provided by current source <b>443</b>, then the voltage at the drain of transistor <b>441</b>, which is the over-voltage signal <b>323</b>, remains low. When over-voltage signal <b>323</b> remains low, the output of NOR gate <b>447</b> remains high assuming that there was no under-voltage condition indicated by under-voltage signal <b>319</b> and no remote off condition indicated by on/off signal <b>311</b>.</p>
    <p>The output of NOR gate <b>447</b> is enable/disable signal <b>331</b>. In one embodiment, enable/disable signal <b>331</b> is high if on/off signal <b>311</b> is low, or under-voltage signal <b>319</b> is high and over-voltage signal <b>323</b> is low. Otherwise, enable/disable signal <b>331</b> is low.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, the oscillator <b>467</b> receives enable/disable signal <b>331</b> at the start/stop input <b>469</b>. In one embodiment, oscillator <b>467</b> generates oscillating waveforms at oscillating waveform outputs <b>471</b>, <b>473</b> and <b>475</b> while enable/disable signal <b>331</b> is high or active. In one embodiment, oscillator <b>467</b> does not generate the oscillating waveforms at oscillating waveform outputs <b>471</b>, <b>473</b> and <b>475</b> while enable/disable signal <b>331</b> is low or in-active. In one embodiment, oscillator <b>467</b> begins generating oscillating waveforms starting with new complete cycles on a rising edge of enable/disable signal <b>331</b>. In one embodiment, oscillator <b>467</b> completes existing cycles of the oscillating waveforms generated at oscillating waveform outputs <b>471</b>, <b>473</b> and <b>475</b> before stopping the waveforms in response to a falling edge of enable/disable signal <b>331</b>. That is, oscillator <b>467</b> stops generating the waveforms at a point just before the start of an on time of power switch of the next cycle in response to a falling edge of enable/disable signal <b>331</b>.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, control terminal <b>145</b> supplies power to the circuitry of power supply controller <b>139</b> and also provides feedback to modulate the duty cycle of switching waveform <b>335</b>. In one embodiment, control terminal <b>145</b> is coupled to the output of the power supply <b>101</b> through a feedback circuit to regulate the output voltage of the power supply <b>101</b>. In one embodiment, an increase in the output voltage of power supply <b>101</b> results in the reduction in the duty cycle of switching waveform <b>335</b> through feedback received through control terminal <b>145</b>. Therefore, if the regulation level of the output parameter of power supply <b>101</b> that is being controlled, such as output voltage or current or power, is exceeded during operation, additional feedback current is received through control terminal <b>145</b>. This feedback current flows through resistor <b>455</b> and through a shunt regulator formed by transistor <b>457</b> and comparator <b>459</b>. If no feedback current or control terminal current in excess of supply current is received through control terminal <b>145</b>, the current through transistor <b>457</b> is zero. If the current through transistor <b>457</b> is zero, and assuming for the time being that there is no current through the diode <b>451</b>, the current through resistor <b>479</b> is zero. If there is no current flowing through resistor <b>479</b>, then the voltage drop across resistor <b>479</b> is zero. If there is no voltage drop across resistor <b>479</b>, there is no voltage drop across capacitor <b>483</b>. As a result, the output of comparator <b>477</b> will remain low. If the output of comparator <b>477</b> remains low, and assuming for the time being that the output of AND gate <b>487</b> remains low, the output of latch <b>491</b> will remain high. In this case, the maximum duty cycle signal, which is produced by oscillator waveform output <b>471</b>, will be generated at the output of AND gate <b>493</b>. Thus, switching waveform <b>335</b> will have the maximum duty cycle produced by oscillator waveform output <b>471</b>.</p>
    <p>Therefore, when the voltage drop across resistor <b>479</b> remains at zero, the maximum duty cycle produced at oscillator waveform output <b>471</b> is not limited, assuming that the output of AND gate <b>487</b> remains low. This is because latch <b>491</b> is not reset through the output of comparator <b>477</b>. However, when the feedback current or control terminal current in excess to the supply current is received through control terminal <b>145</b>, this feedback current flows through transistor <b>457</b>. As the amount of current flowing through the transistor <b>457</b> increases, the voltage drop across resistor <b>479</b> increases correspondingly. As a voltage drop across resistor <b>479</b> increases, the voltage drop across capacitor <b>483</b> will increase. In any given cycle, when the voltage on the oscillating waveform output <b>475</b> crosses below the voltage across the capacitor <b>483</b> the output of the comparator will go high and terminate the on-time of the switching waveform <b>335</b> or turn off the power switch <b>495</b>. As a result, the duty cycle (on time as a fraction of the cycle time) of the switching waveform <b>335</b> decreases with increase in voltage drop across resistor <b>479</b>.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, the oscillating waveform at oscillating waveform output <b>475</b> is a sawtooth waveform having a duty cycle and period equal to the maximum duty cycle waveform generated at oscillating waveform output <b>471</b>. As the voltage drop across resistor <b>479</b> increases, the output of comparator <b>477</b> will go high closer to the beginning of each cycle. When the output of comparator <b>477</b> goes high, latch <b>491</b> will be reset through NOR gate <b>489</b>. When latch <b>491</b> is reset, the on time of the of switching waveform <b>335</b> is terminated for that particular cycle and switching waveform <b>335</b> remains low for the remainder of that particular cycle. Latch <b>491</b> will not be set again until the beginning of the next cycle through switching waveform output <b>473</b>, assuming that there is a high or active enable/disable signal <b>331</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring now to maximum duty cycle adjuster signal <b>325</b>, transistor <b>449</b> includes a source coupled to control terminal <b>145</b> and a gate coupled the gate and drain of transistor <b>427</b> to receive positive current sense signal <b>307</b>. Transistor <b>449</b> and transistor <b>427</b> also form a current mirror. Therefore, the current flowing through transistor <b>449</b> is proportional to the current flowing through transistor <b>427</b>, which is proportional to the positive current flowing into multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. The current that flows through diode <b>451</b> is the difference between the current that flows through transistor <b>449</b> and the current that flows into current source <b>453</b>. The current that flows through current source <b>453</b> is set such that current will not begin to flow through diode <b>451</b> until the current flowing through transistor <b>449</b> rises above a threshold. In one embodiment, the above threshold value is chosen such that the maximum duty cycle is not reduced until the positive current flowing into multi-function terminal <b>149</b> rises above the threshold used for under-voltage comparison. In one embodiment, the threshold positive current used for under-voltage comparison is approximately 50 microamps and the threshold positive current used for maximum duty cycle adjustment is approximately 60 microamps.</p>
    <p>When current begins to flows through diode <b>451</b>, that current will be combined with current that flows through transistor <b>457</b>. In one embodiment, the current that flows through diode <b>451</b> is maximum duty cycle adjustment signal <b>327</b>. The current flowing through transistor <b>457</b> and diode <b>451</b> will flow through resistor <b>479</b>. As discussed in detail above, current that flows through resistor <b>479</b> will result in the voltage drop across resistor <b>479</b>, which results in a reduction in the maximum duty cycle of switching waveform <b>335</b>. As the current that flows through resistor <b>479</b> increases, the maximum duty cycle of switching waveform <b>335</b> will be decreased.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating some of the currents, voltages and duty cycles associated with the power supply controller <b>139</b> in accordance with teachings of the present invention. In particular, diagram <b>501</b> illustrates when the power supply is enabled in relation to the input current of multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. The x-axis represents the positive or negative current flowing into or out of multi-function terminal <b>149</b>. As illustrated, as positive input current rises from zero and crosses over <b>50</b> microamps, power supply controller <b>139</b> in one embodiment is enabled. At this time, an under-voltage condition is removed. If the current is above 50 microamps but then falls below zero microamps, power supply controller <b>139</b> is disabled. At this time, an under-voltage condition is detected. The difference between 50 microamps and zero microamps provides hysteresis, which provides for more stable operation during noise or ripple conditions in the input current.</p>
    <p>As the input current rises above 225 microamps, the power supply is disabled. At this time, an over-voltage condition is detected. When the input current falls back below 215 microamps, the power supply is re-enabled. At this time, the over-voltage condition is removed. The difference between 225 microamps and 215 microamps provides hysteresis, which provides for more stable operation during noise or ripple conditions in the input current.</p>
    <p>Continuing with diagram <b>501</b>, when the negative current that flows out from multi-function terminal <b>149</b> rises in magnitude to a level above 50 microamps, which is illustrated as −50 microamps in FIG. 5, the power supply is enabled. At this time, the on/off feature of the present invention turns on the power supply. When the negative current falls in magnitude to a level below 40 microamps, which is illustrated as −40 microamps in FIG. 5, the power supply is disabled. At this time, the on/off feature of the present invention turns off the power supply. The difference between −50 microamps and −40 microamps provides hysteresis, which provides for more stable operation during noise or ripple conditions in the input current.</p>
    <p>It is worthwhile to note that in one embodiment the positive input current is clamped at 300 microamps and that the negative input current is clamped at 200 microamps. The positive input current would be clamped at 300 microamps when, for example, the multi-function terminal <b>149</b> is short-circuited to a supply voltage. The negative input current would be clamped at 200 microamps when, for example, the multi-function terminal is short-circuited to ground.</p>
    <p>In diagram <b>503</b>, the current limit through power switch <b>147</b> as adjusted by the present invention is illustrated. Note that the hysteresis of the under-voltage and over-voltage conditions are illustrated from zero microamps to 50 microamps and from 215 microamps to 225 microamps, respectively. In one embodiment, when positive input current is provided into multi-function terminal <b>149</b> and there is neither an under-voltage condition nor an over-voltage condition, the current limit through power switch <b>147</b> is 3 amps. However, when negative current flows out from multi-function terminal <b>149</b>, and the magnitude of the negative current rises above 50 microamps, which is illustrated as −50 microamps in FIG. 5, the current limit through power switch <b>149</b> is approximately 1 amp. As the magnitude of the negative current rises to 150 microamps, which is illustrated as −150 microamps in FIG. 5, the current limit through power switch <b>149</b> rises proportionally with the negative current to 3 amps. After the magnitude of the negative current rises above 150 microamps, the current limit of the power switch <b>149</b> remains fixed at 3 amps. Note that there is also the on/off hysteresis between −50 microamps and 40 microamps in diagram <b>503</b>.</p>
    <p>Diagram <b>505</b> illustrates the maximum duty cycle setting of power supply controller <b>139</b> in relation to the input current. Note that the hysteresis from −50 microamps to 40 microamps, from zero microamps to 50 microamps and from to 215 microamps to 225 microamps as discussed above is included. In the embodiment illustrated in diagram <b>505</b>, the maximum duty cycle is fixed at 75 percent until a positive input current of 60 microamps is reached. As the input current continues to increase, the maximum duty cycle continues to decrease until an input current of 225 microamps is reached, at which time the maximum duty cycle has been reduced to 33 percent. As illustrated, between 60 microamps and 225 microamps, the maximum duty cycle is inversely proportional to the positive input current. Note that when negative current flows through multi-function terminal <b>149</b>, and when the power supply is enabled, the maximum duty cycle in one embodiment is fixed at 75 percent.</p>
    <p>Diagram <b>507</b> illustrates the voltage at multi-function terminal, which is labeled in diagram <b>507</b> as line sense voltage, in relation to the input current. When negative current is flowing from multi-function terminal <b>149</b>, the voltage at multi-function terminal <b>149</b> is fixed at the band gap voltage V<sub>BG</sub>, which in one embodiment is 1.25 volts. When positive current is flowing into multi-function terminal <b>149</b>, the voltage at multi-function terminal is fixed at the band gap voltage V<sub>BG </sub>plus a threshold voltage V<sub>TP</sub>, which in one embodiment sum to 2.3 volts. In the event that a negative current having a magnitude of more than 200 microamps is attempted to be drawn out of the multi-function terminal <b>149</b>, the voltage at multi-function terminal <b>149</b> drops to approximately zero volts. In the event that a positive current of more than 300 microamps flows into multi-function terminal <b>149</b>, the voltage at multi-function terminal <b>149</b> rises. In this case, the voltage will be limited by either by a standard clamp used at the multi-function terminal for the purpose of protection or by the external circuitry driving the multi-function terminal, whichever is lower in voltage.</p>
    <p>It is appreciated that the currents, voltages, duty cycle settings and hysteresis settings described in connection with the present invention are given for explanation purposes only and that other values may be selected in accordance with teachings of the present invention. For example, in other embodiments, non hysteretic thresholds may be utilized. Thus the hysteresis values may be greater than or equal to zero.</p>
    <p>FIG. 6A is timing diagram illustrating one embodiment of some of the waveforms of a power supply controller in accordance with teachings of the present invention. Referring to both FIGS. 4 and 6A, oscillating waveform output <b>475</b> of oscillator <b>467</b> generates a sawtooth waveform, which is received by comparator <b>477</b>. Oscillating waveform output <b>471</b> of oscillator <b>467</b> generates a maximum duty cycle signal, which is received by AND gate <b>493</b>. Enable/disable signal <b>331</b>, which is received at enable/disable input <b>469</b> of oscillator <b>467</b>, is also illustrated. In FIG. 6A, the enable/disable signal <b>331</b> is active. Therefore, the sawtooth waveform of oscillating waveform output <b>475</b> and the maximum duty cycle waveform of oscillating waveform output <b>471</b> are generated. Note that the sawtooth waveform and the maximum duty cycle waveform have the same frequency and period. One cycle of each of these waveform occurs between time <b>601</b> and time <b>605</b>. The peak of the sawtooth waveform occurs at the same time as the rising edge of the maximum duty cycle waveform. This aspect is illustrated at time <b>601</b> and at time <b>605</b>. The lowest point of the sawtooth waveform occurs at the same time as the falling edge of the maximum duty cycle waveform. This aspect is illustrated at time <b>603</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 6B, a timing diagram illustrating another embodiment of the waveforms of a power supply controller in accordance with teachings of the present invention is shown. From time <b>607</b> to time <b>609</b>, the enable/disable signal <b>331</b> is low or inactive. In one embodiment, a low enable/disable signal <b>331</b> disables the power supply. A high or active enable/disable signal <b>331</b> enables the power supply. At time <b>609</b>, the rising edge of enable/disable signal <b>331</b> occurs. At this time, oscillating waveform outputs <b>475</b> and <b>471</b> begin generating the sawtooth waveform and maximum duty cycle waveform, respectively. Note that a new complete cycle of each of these waveforms is generated in response to the rising edge of enable/disable signal <b>331</b> at time <b>609</b>.</p>
    <p>From time <b>609</b> to time <b>611</b>, enable/disable signal <b>331</b> remains high or active. Thus, during this time, the sawtooth waveform and maximum duty cycle waveform are continuously generated.</p>
    <p>At time <b>611</b>, a falling edge of enable/disable signal <b>331</b> occurs. Before oscillator <b>467</b> discontinues generating the sawtooth waveform and the maximum duty cycle waveform, the existing cycles of each of these waveforms are allowed to complete. Stated differently, generation of the sawtooth waveform and the maximum duty cycle waveform is discontinued at a point just before the start of the on-time of the switching waveform <b>335</b> or the on-time of the power switch of the next cycle. This point in time is illustrated in FIG. 6B at time <b>613</b>. Note that after time <b>613</b>, the sawtooth waveform remains inactive at a high value and the maximum duty cycle waveform remains inactive at a low value.</p>
    <p>At time <b>615</b>, another rising edge of enable/disable signal <b>331</b> occurs. Therefore, the sawtooth waveform and the maximum duty cycle waveform are generated beginning at a new complete cycle of each waveform. As illustrated in FIG. 6B, a falling edge of enable/disable signal <b>331</b> occurs at time <b>617</b>, which is immediately after the rising edge. However, the sawtooth waveform and maximum duty cycle waveforms are allowed to complete their then existing cycles. This occurs at time <b>619</b>. After time <b>619</b>, the waveforms remains inactive as shown during the time between time <b>619</b> and time <b>621</b>, which is when another rising edge of enable/disable signal <b>331</b> occurs. At time <b>621</b>, another new complete cycle of the sawtooth waveform and the maximum duty cycle waveform are generated. Since enable/disable signal <b>331</b> is deactivated at time <b>623</b>, which occurs during a cycle of the sawtooth waveform and the maximum duty cycle waveform, these waveforms are deactivated after fully completing their respective cycles. Thus, by pulsing the on/off control signal at the multi-function terminal it is possible to synchronize the oscillator to the on/off pulse frequency.</p>
    <p>FIG. 7 is a schematic of another embodiment of a power supply controller <b>139</b> in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. The power supply controller schematic shown in FIG. 7 is similar to the power supply controller schematic discussed above in FIG. <b>4</b>. The primary difference between the power supply controller of FIGS. 4 and 7 is that oscillator <b>467</b> of FIG. 7 does not have an enable/disable input <b>469</b> coupled to receive enable/disable signal <b>331</b>. As shown in the embodiment depicted in FIG. 7, the enable/disable signal <b>331</b> is used to directly gate the switching waveform at the input of AND gate <b>493</b>. In this embodiment, the oscillator <b>467</b> is running all the time and switching waveform <b>335</b> will be gated on and off at any point in the cycle in response to the enable/disable signal <b>331</b>.</p>
    <p>To illustrate, FIG. 8 shows one embodiment of timing diagrams of switching waveforms of the power supply controller illustrated in FIG. <b>7</b>. Referring to both FIGS. 7 and 8, oscillating waveform output <b>475</b> of oscillator <b>467</b> generates a sawtooth waveform, which is received by comparator <b>477</b>. Oscillating waveform output <b>471</b> of oscillator <b>467</b> generates a maximum duty cycle signal, which is received by AND gate <b>493</b>. Enable/disable signal <b>331</b>, which is received by AND gate <b>493</b>, and the output of AND gate <b>493</b>, which is switching waveform <b>335</b>, are also illustrated. In FIG. 8, the enable/disable signal <b>331</b> is active only some of the time. Therefore, the switching waveform <b>335</b> is switching only during those portions of time that the enable/disable signal <b>331</b> is active. When the enable/disable signal <b>331</b> is not active, switching waveform <b>335</b> does not switch.</p>
    <p>In the foregoing detailed description, the method and apparatus of the present invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the present invention. The present specification and figures are accordingly to be regarded as illustrative rather than restrictive.</p>
