The rail portion extends upwardly on a first side of the mattress to extend beyond the sleeping surface of the mattress and prevent a person from rolling out of bed. The leg portion is sandwiched between the mattress and the box spring and extends toward a second side of the mattress. In one embodiment, the leg portion includes a distal end that is engaged to the second side of at least one of the mattress and box spring such that the distal end and rail portion hug the mattress. In another embodiment, the bed rail includes a relatively rigid cover depending from an upper portion of the rail portion to the sleeping surface so as to cover a gap that may exist between the first side of the mattress and the rail portion. In still another embodiment, the rail portion is set at an acute angle relative to the leg portion so as to tend to close off any gap between the first side of the mattress and the rail portion. In another embodiment, the wall of the rail portion may include tubing and the rail portion may be drawn against the bed with a strap extending about the periphery of the bed.</div>

<p num="p-0002">This application is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/652,296 filed Aug. 29, 2003 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,952,846, and claims the benefit thereof under 35 U.S.C. § 120. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/652,296 filed Aug. 29, 2003, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,952,846, claimed the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/407,369 filed Aug. 30, 2002 under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e). U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/652,296 filed Aug. 29, 2003, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,952,846, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/407,369 filed Aug. 30, 2002 are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.</p>
<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">The present invention relates particularly to a bed rail and specifically to a bed rail that hugs the mattress to maximize a tight fit between the rail portion and the side of a mattress and to minimize the chance that a child can fall between the rail portion of the bed rail and the side of the mattress.</p>
  <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0004">A bed rail is a structure engaged to the side of a bed to prevent a person, especially a child, from rolling out of bed and falling to the floor. A bed rail includes a leg portion that is sandwiched between the mattress and box spring. A bed rail further includes a rail portion that extends from the leg portion and upwardly to and beyond the sleeping surface of the bed. The rail portion forms the rail that prevents the child from rolling out of bed.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">A bed rail is intended to provide a safe sleeping environment, particularly for a child. However, the leg portion tends to work its way out from between the mattress and the box spring. As the leg portion works its way out, a gap is created between the side of the mattress and the rail portion of the bed rail. Children have rolled off the bed, have fallen into the gap, and have been entrapped between the bed rail and side of the mattress.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0006">A feature of the present invention is the provision in a bed rail having a rail portion confronting a first side of a bed and extending upwardly beyond a sleeping surface of the bed and a leg portion extending from the rail portion and running toward a second side of a bed, of a member engaged to the leg portion and adapted for engaging the second side of the bed such that the member and rail portion hug the bed therebetween to minimize a creation of a gap between the rail portion and the first side of the bed.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">Another feature of the present invention is the provision in a bed rail having a rail portion confronting a first side of a bed and extending upwardly beyond a sleeping surface of the bed and a leg portion extending from the rail portion and running toward a second side of a bed, of a cover depending from an upper portion of the rail portion and extending over a portion of the sleeping surface of the bed to cover any gap that may be created between the rail portion and the first side of the mattress.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">A feature of the present invention is the provision in a bed rail having a rail portion confronting a first side of a bed and extending upwardly beyond a sleeping surface of the bed and a leg portion extending from the rail portion and running toward a second side of a bed, of the rail portion being set at an angle relative to the leg portion so that the rail portion confronts as much as possible the edge of the mattress where the sleeping surface joins the first side of the mattress.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">An advantage of the present bed rail is safety. The embodiments of the invention have means for minimizing the creation of the gap between the rail portion and the first side of the mattress.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">Another advantage of the present invention is that the bed rail is easy to set up so as to provide a tight fit between the rail portion and the first side of the mattress.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">Another advantage of the present invention is that the bed rail is difficult to set up when an attempt is made to create a less tight fit between the rail portion and the first side of the mattress.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">Another advantage of the present invention is that the bed rail includes a compact configuration for storage.</p>

The pivot lock arm <b>120</b> includes a pivot <b>122</b> joined to frame <b>32</b> of rail portion <b>42</b>. The pivot lock arm <b>120</b> includes a distal end portion <b>124</b> that is joined to a distal edge portion <b>126</b> of cover <b>104</b>. Pivot <b>122</b> includes a lock such that a downward operating position (shown in solid lines in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>) of cover <b>104</b> may be locked in place on top of sleeping surface <b>102</b>. The lock may also be operational when the pivot lock arm <b>120</b> is in an upward open position (shown in phantom in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>). Also shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref> is a pivot structure <b>130</b> that may be provided between rail portion <b>42</b> and leg portion <b>44</b> to permit the bed rail <b>40</b> to be folded for storage. The lock arm <b>120</b> may pivot for about 180 degrees from a position on sleeping surface <b>102</b> to a position on the other side of the rail portion <b>42</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0091"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> shows another embodiment of the invention, where leg portion <b>44</b> may include telescoping members <b>140</b> and <b>142</b> to draw the counter member and the rail portion <b>44</b> to and away from each other. Telescoping members <b>140</b> and <b>142</b> are squared off to prevent the members <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> from spinning relative to each other.</p>
  <p num="p-0092"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> shows telescoping members <b>144</b> and <b>146</b> that are oval or elliptical in section so as to provide a round shape but yet prevent the members <b>144</b> and <b>146</b> from spinning relative to each other.</p>
  <p num="p-0093"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> shows that one telescoping member <b>140</b> (or <b>144</b>) may be pivotally joined to rail portion <b>42</b> and that another telescoping member <b>142</b> (or <b>146</b>) may include counter member <b>68</b>. Counter member <b>68</b> may include cap <b>148</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0094"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref> shows a button <b>150</b> extending though a hole <b>152</b> formed in member <b>140</b> and a hole <b>154</b> formed in member <b>142</b>. Button <b>150</b> includes a base <b>156</b> affixed to an inner surface of member <b>142</b> and further includes an inclined surface <b>158</b> and an upright or confronting surface <b>160</b> confronting surfaces of the members <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> that form the holes <b>152</b>, <b>154</b>. The provision of the inclined surface <b>158</b> on button <b>150</b> permits the counter member <b>68</b> and rail portion <b>42</b> to be drawn towards each other automatically or with little effort. Accordingly, it is relatively easy to make the rail portion <b>42</b> fit tightly against the first side <b>26</b> of the mattress <b>16</b>. The provision of the confronting surface <b>160</b> on button <b>150</b> permits the counter member <b>68</b> to be drawn apart from the rail portion <b>42</b> only with the difficulty associated with depressing button <b>150</b>. Accordingly, it is relatively difficult to loosen the bed rail <b>40</b> and therefore the chances of forming a gap <b>30</b> are minimized.</p>
  <p num="p-0095"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows that rail portion <b>42</b> (or the plane in which the frame <b>32</b> of the rail portion <b>42</b> lies) is preferably set at an acute angle A relative to leg portion <b>44</b> (or at an acute angle to the plane in which the leg portions <b>44</b> lie). A pivot mechanism <b>170</b> may permit a swinging between the rail portion <b>42</b> and, in such a case, such pivot mechanism <b>170</b> does not permit a swinging to a right angle arrangement or to a swinging to an obtuse angle arrangement. Preferably, the angle between rail portion <b>42</b> and leg portion <b>44</b> is between 70 and 89 degrees, more preferably between 70 and 88 degrees, even more preferably between 70 and 87 degrees, yet more preferably between 70 and 86 degrees, and most more preferably between 70 and 85 degrees. The provision of an acute angle between the rail portion <b>42</b> and leg portion <b>44</b> works to close off any gap <b>30</b> and sets the rail portion <b>42</b> as close to the sleeping surface <b>102</b> as possible. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the most preferred angle B of five degrees (where angle A is 85 degrees) where angle B defines the relationship between rail portion <b>42</b> and a plane parallel to the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b>. The button <b>150</b> and its cooperating apertures may be referred to as a one directional quick connect.</p>
  <p num="p-0096">As to rail portion <b>42</b>, as to leg portion <b>44</b>, as to frame <b>32</b>, as to wall <b>34</b>, as to how rail portion <b>42</b> and leg portion <b>44</b> are swingable to each other and as to how rail portion <b>42</b> and leg portion <b>44</b> may be foldable or collapsible to a stored position, the Wu U.S. Pat. No. 5,671,490 issued Sep. 30, 1997 is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
  <p num="p-0097">It should be noted that the present bed rail <b>40</b> may be engaged to only a mattress or to only a mattress and a frame. The frame may or may not have slats. It should be noted that leg <b>44</b> may be broad or paddle-shaped so as to rest upon slats instead of falling through the slats. Slats may be used where no box spring is used.</p>
  <p num="p-0098"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a bed rail <b>200</b>. Bed rail <b>200</b> generally includes a leg portion <b>202</b> and a rail portion <b>204</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0099">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, rail portion <b>204</b> includes a frame assembly <b>206</b>. Frame assembly <b>206</b> includes upper rails or tubes <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, lower rails or tubes <b>212</b> and <b>214</b>, and side rails or tubes <b>216</b> and <b>218</b>. Upper rails <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> are interconnected via a hinge mechanism <b>220</b>. Frame assembly <b>206</b> further includes respective first and second upper corner two point connections <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> and first and second lower corner three point connections <b>226</b>, <b>228</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0100">Distal ends or distal end portions of upper tubes <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> are pivotally affixed via respective pins <b>230</b>, <b>232</b> to upper corner connections <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> such that tubes <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> swing relative to tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>. Such relative swinging of tubes <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>216</b> and <b>218</b> occurs in generally the same plane. An inner portion <b>234</b> of each of the corner connections <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> are U-shaped in cross section to permit the tubes <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> to swing relative to corner connections <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> and toward tubes <b>216</b> and <b>218</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0101">Upper ends or upper end portions of side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> are rigidly affixed, with no pivotal swinging and no axial sliding, in a cylindrical receptacle formed in an outer portion <b>236</b> of each of the corner connections <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>. The cylindrical receptacle is a non-through hole. Each of the upper end portions of the side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> are fixed in their respective cylindrical receptacles with a pin. Such a pin is preferably a spring biased button which, upon being pushed into its respective side tube <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, permits the respective side tube <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> to be withdrawn out of the cylindrical receptacle for disassembly and then snapped back in for reassembly. Such is preferable because this allows the sheet wall <b>370</b> to be easily taken off and placed back on the frame assembly <b>206</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0102">Each of the lower corner connections <b>226</b>, <b>228</b> is a three point connection and includes a molded body <b>240</b> that is integral and one-piece. Body <b>240</b> includes a pair of opposing, spaced apart sidewalls <b>242</b>, <b>244</b> where sidewall <b>242</b> is an outer sidewall and where sidewall <b>244</b> is an inner sidewall. Sidewalls <b>242</b>, <b>244</b> lead integrally into a female receptor <b>246</b> for a distal end or distal end portion <b>248</b> of base leg sections <b>250</b> of the leg portion <b>202</b> of the bed rail <b>200</b>. Female receptor <b>246</b> is oblong in section to minimize an axial spinning of base leg sections <b>250</b> relative to the lower connections <b>226</b>, <b>228</b> and thus to minimize an axial spinning of the base leg sections <b>250</b> relative to the rail portion <b>204</b>. Base leg section <b>250</b> is rigidly fixed in receptor <b>246</b> and to body <b>240</b> via a pin <b>252</b>. It should be noted that molded body <b>240</b> is preferably reinforced with a steel bracket having steel plate portions <b>253</b> engaged on the inner sides of sidewalls <b>242</b>, <b>244</b>. Steel plate portions <b>253</b> are interconnected via an integral bracket <b>255</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0103">Body <b>240</b> further includes a cradle <b>254</b> for engaging the distal ends or distal end portions <b>256</b>, <b>258</b> of lower tubes <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>. Cradle <b>254</b> is one-piece and integral with body <b>240</b> such that cradle <b>254</b> is one-piece and integral with female receptor <b>246</b>. Cradle <b>254</b> is a semi-circular open end receptor having a pair of aligned through holes <b>260</b>. Holes <b>260</b> engage opposing ends of an outer two ended button <b>262</b> which is found on distal end portion <b>256</b> of lower tube <b>212</b> and which is further found on distal end portion <b>258</b> of lower tube <b>214</b>. Each of the ends of button <b>262</b> extends, in the biased and locked position, beyond the outer diametrical surface of its respective tube <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> such that each of the ends of button <b>262</b> can engage holes <b>260</b>. Each of the ends of button <b>262</b> is resiliently depressable or pushable radially into tube <b>212</b> or <b>214</b> such that the absolute end of button <b>262</b> is at or within the outer diametrical surface of tube <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> such that the button <b>262</b> can disengage from holes <b>260</b>. Outer two ended buttons <b>262</b> may be operated directly such as by sliding a fingernail between cradle <b>254</b> and the end of the button <b>262</b>. More preferably, each of the outer two ended buttons <b>262</b> is operated by a respective inner two ended button <b>264</b> that is not engaged by cradle <b>254</b> and that lies at an accessible location outside of cradle <b>254</b> when tubes <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> are engaged by cradles <b>254</b>. Each of the ends of buttons <b>262</b>, <b>264</b> extends through openings formed in tubes <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>. The structural arrangement for buttons <b>262</b>, <b>264</b> includes a C-shaped flat spring pinched resiliently within each of the distal end portions <b>256</b>, <b>258</b> of tubes <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>. Each of the ends of the C-spring includes one end of button <b>262</b> and one end of button <b>264</b> such that a pushing upon one end of inner button <b>264</b> draws the respective, same sided outer button <b>262</b> inwardly. Hence a pinching of the ends of inner button <b>264</b> radially inwardly also draws the outer ends of button <b>262</b> radially inwardly.</p>
  <p num="p-0104">Each of the sidewalls <b>242</b>, <b>244</b> includes an upper open ended slot or detent <b>270</b> for receiving a roller <b>272</b> rotatably engaged on a pin <b>274</b>. Pin <b>274</b> in turn is affixed to, and extends at a right angle to, a spring biased plunger <b>276</b> engaged within each of the side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref>, a first end or base <b>279</b> of plunger <b>278</b> is rigidly fixed to its side tube <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> with a pin <b>280</b>. A coil spring <b>282</b> extends from base <b>279</b> to a piece <b>284</b> having a portion set within the coil spring <b>282</b> and having a disk portion slidingly engaging the inner diametrical surface of tube <b>216</b> or <b>218</b>. Piece <b>284</b> leads into a projection <b>286</b> which has a through hole formed therein for pin <b>274</b>. Piece <b>284</b> and projection <b>286</b> may be molded as one part so as to be one-piece and integral. A pair of slots <b>288</b> are formed in each of the tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>. Slots <b>288</b> of tube <b>216</b> are aligned with each other and slots <b>288</b> of tube <b>218</b> are aligned with each other such that pin <b>274</b> can travel the length of slots <b>288</b> and in the axial direction of tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0105">Body <b>240</b> is pivotally fixed to side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> via a pin <b>290</b> engaged to each of the sidewalls <b>242</b>, <b>244</b>. Body <b>240</b> is fixed or locked in position to side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> by the rollers <b>272</b> being engaged in the detents <b>270</b>. In the locked position, the plunger <b>278</b> is biased to its extended position by the coil spring <b>282</b> and keeps the rollers <b>272</b> locked into the detents <b>270</b>. To unlock the side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> from the lower corner connections <b>226</b>, <b>228</b> and hence to unlock rail portion <b>204</b> from the leg portion <b>202</b>, the rollers <b>272</b> are drawn by hand axially toward a central portion of tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> to draw the rollers <b>272</b> out of the detents <b>270</b>. When the rollers <b>272</b> are disengaged from the detents <b>270</b>, the side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> are relatively swingable relative to the leg portions <b>202</b>. This relative swinging permits: 1) the rail portion <b>204</b> to be swung downwardly to a right angle relative to the leg portion <b>202</b> to confront side <b>26</b> of box spring <b>18</b> so that one can have relatively easy access to get in and out of the bed <b>24</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>; 2) the rail portion <b>204</b> to be swung upwardly to an upright position and right angle position relative to the leg portion <b>202</b>, whereupon the rollers <b>272</b> snap into the detents <b>270</b> under the plunger bias, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>; 3) the side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> to be swingable relative to the legs <b>250</b> such that the legs <b>250</b> can be drawn upward relative to the side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> for storage, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>; and 4) the side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> to be swingable relative to the legs <b>250</b> such that the legs <b>250</b> and side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> can be unfolded from a stored compact arrangement and locked into an operating position.</p>
  <p num="p-0106">Sidewalls <b>242</b>, <b>244</b> of body <b>240</b> have a partially curved and partially linear perimeter <b>292</b> upon which the rollers <b>272</b> roll when the bed rail <b>200</b> is being folded into or from a stored, compact arrangement. Sidewalls <b>242</b>, <b>244</b> have a partially curved and partially linear perimeter <b>294</b> upon which the rollers <b>272</b> roll when the rail portion <b>204</b> is being dropped against the side <b>26</b> of the box spring <b>18</b> or when the rail portion <b>204</b> is being swung up from side <b>26</b> of box spring <b>18</b> to an upright operating position against the side <b>26</b> of the mattress <b>16</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows the downwardly swung position of the rail portion <b>204</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0107">Lower tubes <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> engage each other with a male/female connection. Lower tube <b>212</b> includes an inner female end portion <b>300</b> having a hole or button receptor <b>302</b>. Lower tube <b>214</b> includes an inner male end portion <b>304</b> having a button <b>306</b> that is biased radially outwardly so as to snap into hole <b>302</b> and lock the tubes <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> relative to each other such that the tubes <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> cannot spin relative to each other and such that the tubes <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> cannot slide in the axial direction relative to each other until the button <b>306</b> is pressed, whereupon the tubes <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> can be disengaged from each other.</p>
  <p num="p-0108">Lower tubes <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>, when fixed to each other and set in cradles <b>254</b>, provide a rigid lower rail for the rail portion <b>204</b>; side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, when the rollers <b>272</b> are locked in the detents <b>270</b>, provide rigid side rails for the rail portion <b>204</b>; and upper tubes <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, when the hinge mechanism <b>220</b> is locked, provide a rigid upper rail for the rail portion <b>204</b>, whereby a relatively rigid frame assembly <b>206</b> is provided for rail portion <b>204</b>.</p>

When the unlocking mechanism <b>342</b> is drawn upwardly, the curved periphery portions <b>362</b> are drawn against the rollers <b>340</b>, which in turn pushes the pins <b>324</b>, <b>326</b> against the bias of the coil springs <b>332</b> out of the detents <b>366</b> and into the curved track portions <b>364</b>, thereby permitting each of the tubes <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> to be swung on the pivot pins <b>320</b>, <b>322</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref> shows the curved periphery portions <b>362</b> relative to the detents <b>366</b> when the unlocking mechanism <b>342</b> is fully squeezed.

The root base points of the arc track portions <b>364</b> act as a stop for pins <b>324</b>, <b>326</b> and prevent a further swinging of the tubes <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> beyond parallel relationship.</p>
  <p num="p-0114">To lock the hinge mechanism <b>220</b> from the position shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>, the tubes <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> are swung on their pivots <b>320</b>, <b>322</b> such that the pins <b>324</b>, <b>326</b> ride in the curved track portions <b>364</b> toward the detents <b>366</b>. Upon reaching the detents <b>366</b>, the pins <b>324</b>, <b>326</b> snap into the detents under the bias of the coil springs <b>332</b>, whereupon the tubes <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> are locked relative to each other and whereupon the rollers <b>240</b> confront the curved periphery portions <b>362</b> for a subsequent unlocking operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0115">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, rail portion <b>204</b> further includes a fabric wall <b>370</b> engaged to the frame assembly <b>206</b>. Fabric wall <b>370</b> generally includes a tubular periphery <b>372</b> and an interior, preferably nylon, mesh <b>374</b>. Tubular periphery <b>372</b> engages frame assembly <b>206</b>. Interior mesh <b>374</b> is engaged by the tubular periphery <b>372</b>. Tubular periphery <b>372</b> includes a pair of side wall sections <b>376</b>, <b>378</b> for engaging side tubes <b>216</b> and <b>218</b>, a lower wall section <b>380</b> for engaging lower tubes <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>, and an upper wall section <b>382</b> for engaging upper tubes <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>. Each of the side wall sections <b>376</b>, <b>378</b> is a sheet of nylon folded over to form a tubular portion <b>384</b> formed by stitching <b>386</b>. Side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> run through the tubular portions <b>384</b>. Inner edges of side wall sections <b>376</b>, <b>378</b> are engaged by stitching <b>387</b> to side edges of mesh <b>374</b>. Lower wall section <b>380</b> is a sheet of nylon folded over to form a tubular portion <b>388</b> through which lower tubes <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> run. Tubular portion <b>388</b> is formed by stitching <b>390</b> that also engages lower wall section <b>380</b> to the lower edge of mesh <b>374</b>. Upper wall section <b>382</b> includes a sheet of nylon folded over to form a tubular portion <b>392</b> through which upper tubes <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> run. Tubular portion <b>392</b> is formed by stitching <b>394</b> that also engages the upper wall section <b>382</b> to the upper edge of mesh <b>374</b>. Tubular portion <b>392</b> is of sufficient size such that, when fabric wall <b>370</b> is removed from frame assembly <b>206</b>, the hinge mechanism <b>220</b> can slide through the tubular portion <b>392</b>. Upper wall section <b>382</b> further includes a sheet of cushion <b>394</b> or resilient material engaged to the underside of the sheet of nylon so as to pad the upper tubes <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> and hinge mechanism <b>220</b> relative to a person sleeping in bed <b>24</b>. Besides being engaged to the nylon mesh <b>374</b>, each of the wall sections <b>376</b>, <b>378</b>, <b>380</b> and <b>382</b> are engaged to adjacent wall sections via stitching <b>386</b>, <b>390</b> and <b>394</b> so as to provide strength to the fabric wall <b>370</b>. In other words, lower wall section <b>380</b> is engaged by stitching <b>386</b> and <b>390</b> to side wall sections <b>376</b>, <b>378</b>, and upper wall section <b>382</b> is engaged by stitching <b>386</b> and <b>394</b> to side wall sections <b>376</b>, <b>378</b>. When rail portion <b>204</b> is swung relative to leg portion <b>202</b>, tubular portion <b>388</b> pivots relative to tubes <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0116">Fabric wall <b>370</b> is removable from frame assembly <b>206</b> by 1) first depressing a button in the upper ends of side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> so as to disconnect the side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> from the upper connections <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, 2) then sliding the side wall sections <b>376</b>, <b>378</b> off the side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, 3) then sliding the upper wall section <b>382</b> off of tubes <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> and hinge mechanism <b>220</b>, and 4) then sliding the lower wall section <b>380</b> off tubes <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>. Such steps need not take place in such order; however, prior to removing upper wall section <b>382</b>, the side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> are disconnected from the upper connections <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0117">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, bed rail <b>200</b> generally includes a leg portion <b>202</b> and a rail portion <b>204</b>. Leg portion <b>202</b> includes the base leg section <b>250</b> having the proximal end portion <b>248</b> which is engaged in lower connections <b>226</b>, <b>228</b> with pin <b>252</b>. As noted above, female receptor <b>246</b> is oblong in section and base leg section <b>250</b> is oblong in section to minimize relative rotation between female receptor <b>246</b> and base leg section <b>250</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, base leg section <b>250</b> includes a distal end male portion <b>400</b> having a button <b>402</b>. Button <b>402</b> is inclined on its distal side <b>158</b> and runs vertically on its proximal side <b>160</b>. Base leg section <b>250</b> is tubular and is preferably formed of steel.</p>
  <p num="p-0118">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, leg portion <b>202</b> may include a first embodiment of a counter attachment. This counter attachment or counter section, designated by reference numeral <b>404</b>, includes a generally linear female tube portion <b>406</b> having a proximal end portion <b>408</b> and a distal end portion <b>410</b>. Proximal end portion <b>408</b> is a female receptor for male portion <b>400</b> of base leg section <b>250</b> and includes oblong slots <b>412</b> for engaging button <b>402</b>. Slots or detents <b>412</b> are arranged in the axial direction along the upper side of counter attachment <b>404</b> and provide for length adjustment of leg portion <b>202</b> by selective engagement with button <b>402</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0119">Counter attachment <b>404</b> further includes a counter <b>414</b> extending at a generally right angle relative to generally linear tube portion <b>406</b>. Counter <b>414</b> extends integrally from distal end portion <b>410</b> and is one-piece with linear tube portion <b>406</b>. Counter <b>414</b> includes a cap <b>416</b>. Counter <b>414</b> is rigid relative to generally linear tube portion <b>406</b> and keeps the mattress <b>16</b> sandwiched between the rail portion <b>204</b> and the counter <b>414</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0120">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, button <b>402</b> includes the structure of button <b>150</b> and includes a vertical side <b>160</b> and an inclined or tapering side <b>158</b>, where vertical side <b>160</b> is faces the rail portion <b>204</b> and where the tapering side <b>158</b> faces the counter <b>414</b> such that leg portion <b>202</b> may be decreased in length with a relative minimum amount of effort and such that leg portion <b>202</b> may be increased in length only with a relative maximum amount of effort. Tapering side <b>158</b> is a quick connect mechanism. Vertical side <b>160</b> is not a quick connect mechanism and requires hand operation directly on the button for operation. In other words, with such a structure provided to button <b>402</b>, namely tapering side <b>158</b>, counter attachment <b>404</b> is readily slid onto base leg portion <b>250</b> with no need to depress button <b>402</b> such that the rail portion <b>204</b> can readily hug the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b> and such that there is no gap between the rail portion <b>204</b> and the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b>. With such a structure provided to button <b>402</b>, namely vertical side <b>160</b>, leg portion <b>202</b> cannot be increased in length, which would create a gap between the rail portion <b>204</b> and the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b>, without depressing button <b>402</b> because the vertical side <b>160</b> prevents counter attachment <b>404</b> from sliding out of base leg section <b>250</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0121">It should further be noted that, with the counter attachment <b>404</b> and the base leg section <b>250</b> being oblong in section, rotation between the counter attachment <b>404</b> and base leg section <b>250</b> is minimized. Further, as noted above, rotation between base leg section <b>250</b> and its respective connection <b>226</b>, <b>228</b> having oblong female receptor <b>246</b> is minimized. Hence counter <b>414</b> is maintained in an upright position against the second side <b>28</b> of mattress <b>16</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0122">The oblong shape to female receptor <b>246</b>, base leg section <b>250</b>, counter attachment <b>404</b> and counter attachment <b>420</b> further maximizes the flatness of such members so as to minimize any bumps that may manifest themselves at the upper surface of the mattress <b>16</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0123">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, leg portion <b>202</b> may include a second embodiment of a counter attachment. This counter attachment, designated by reference numeral <b>420</b>, includes a tubular medial section <b>422</b> and a tubular counter section <b>424</b>. Medial section <b>422</b> includes a proximal female end <b>426</b> having a circular hole <b>428</b> for reception of button <b>402</b> of base leg section <b>250</b>. Medial section <b>422</b> includes a distal end female portion <b>430</b> having a set of oblong slots or detents <b>432</b> arranged in the axial direction on the upper side of medial section <b>422</b>. Openings <b>432</b> (oblong slots) are of a different shape than opening <b>428</b> (a circular hole) to make assembly of the bed rail <b>200</b> user friendly, based upon sight, for the customer.</p>
  <p num="p-0124">Tubular counter section <b>424</b> includes a proximal end male portion <b>434</b> having a button <b>436</b> that includes the structure of button <b>150</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>. That is, button <b>436</b> includes a vertical side <b>160</b> and a tapering side <b>158</b> such that counter section <b>424</b> can be easily slid into the medial section <b>422</b> so as to decrease the effective length of one of the legs of leg portion <b>202</b>. Button <b>436</b> hence selectively cooperates with one of the slots or detents <b>432</b> of medial section <b>422</b>. Counter section <b>424</b> further includes a distal end portion <b>438</b> and a counter <b>440</b> extending at a right angle from the distal end portion <b>438</b>. A plastic safety cap <b>442</b> caps the end of the counter <b>440</b>. Counter <b>440</b> is rigid relative to distal end portion <b>438</b>. Vertical side <b>160</b> of button <b>436</b> faces counter <b>440</b>. Tapering side <b>158</b> of button <b>436</b> faces the absolute proximal end of counter section <b>424</b> so as to face the rail portion <b>204</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0125">As with counter attachment <b>404</b>, each of medial section <b>422</b>, counter section <b>424</b> and base leg section <b>250</b> is oblong in cross section such that rotation among the sections <b>422</b>, <b>424</b> and <b>250</b> is minimized so as to keep counter <b>440</b> in an upright position on the second side <b>28</b> of mattress <b>16</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0126">As with counter attachment <b>404</b>, merely a relative minimum amount of effort is required to decrease the effective length of counter attachment <b>420</b>, given the relative orientations of tapering sides <b>158</b> of buttons <b>436</b> and <b>402</b>, such that the creation of any gap between the bed rail <b>200</b> and the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b> is prevented. As with counter attachment <b>404</b>, a relative maximum amount of effort is required for increasing the effective length of counter attachment <b>420</b> because of the relative orientations of vertical sides <b>160</b> of buttons <b>436</b> and <b>402</b> so as to minimize the creation of any gap between the bed rail <b>200</b> and the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0127">Counter attachment <b>404</b> may be utilized for a relatively small bed. Counter attachment <b>420</b> may be utilized for a relatively large bed.</p>
  <p num="p-0128">It is noted that, to increase the length of counter attachments <b>404</b> and <b>420</b>, effort is maximized in at least two ways. First, to gain access to the counter attachments, <b>404</b> and <b>420</b>, the mattress <b>16</b> must be lifted off the counter attachments <b>404</b> and <b>420</b>. Since the counters <b>414</b>, <b>440</b> are maintained at an upright position, it is difficult to simply pull the bed rail <b>200</b> from between the mattress <b>16</b> and the box spring <b>18</b>. Second, once access is gained to the counter attachments <b>404</b> and <b>420</b>, buttons <b>402</b>, <b>436</b> must be depressed and then redepressed for each of their respective slots <b>412</b>, <b>432</b> while the female section <b>406</b> is being removed from section <b>250</b> (or slid outwardly relative to each other) and while sections <b>422</b> and <b>424</b> are being separated (or slid outwardly relative to each other). Such a depression and a redepression takes time and effort and such a depression and redepression is preferred. Buttons <b>402</b> and <b>436</b> are resilient and spring based such that their bias is to the outer locked position and such buttons <b>402</b> and <b>436</b> pop out of slots <b>412</b> and <b>432</b> as sections are being slid relative to each other.</p>
  <p num="p-0129"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows the bed rail <b>200</b> in the process of being folded to a compact configuration. Leg portion <b>202</b> and rail portion <b>204</b> have been swung relatively to each other by the operation of connections <b>226</b> and <b>228</b> such that base leg sections <b>250</b> are disposed generally parallel to side tubes <b>216</b> and <b>218</b>. From the position shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, lower tubes <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> are disconnected from the connections <b>226</b>, <b>228</b> and the lower tubes <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> are slid out of the lower wall section <b>380</b>. Then the hinge connection <b>220</b> is squeezed so as to operate the unlocking mechanism <b>342</b>. Indicia <b>450</b> is provided on the upper wall section <b>382</b> to indicate the location and general structure of the hinge mechanism <b>220</b> and unlocking mechanism <b>342</b>. An arrow indicia <b>452</b> is provided on the upper wall section <b>382</b> below indicia <b>450</b> and points at indicia <b>450</b> to indicate the direction the unlocking mechanism <b>342</b> slides to unlock the hinge mechanism <b>3220</b>. Upon an unlocking of the upper tubes <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> relative to each other, the outer ends of the bed rail <b>200</b> can be swung upwardly with the base leg sections <b>250</b> to the compact storage configuration shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0130">In a stored configuration as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, bed rail <b>200</b> with each of the counter attachments <b>404</b> and <b>420</b> can fit in a nylon drawstring bag where the bag measures about seven inches in diameter and about 30 inches in depth.</p>
  <p num="p-0131"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows the preferred embodiment for lower connection <b>226</b> (and <b>228</b>). In this preferred embodiment, side tube <b>216</b> Cor <b>218</b>) is preferably set at an acute angle A relative to leg portion <b>202</b>, including leg base section <b>250</b>. In other words, the following features are aligned on an axis B: side tube <b>216</b> , slots <b>288</b>, slots <b>270</b>, pin <b>290</b>, walls <b>242</b> and <b>244</b>. The following features are aligned on an axis C: female receptor <b>246</b>, base leg section <b>250</b>, and counter attachments <b>404</b> and <b>420</b> (excluding the counters <b>414</b> and <b>440</b>). Axis B is preferably set at acute angle A relative to axis C. Body <b>240</b> is molded and its inner steel bracket is fabricated such that its features on axis A, including the opening for pin <b>290</b> and slots <b>270</b>, is set at predefined acute angle A relative to female receptor or sleeve <b>246</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0132">Such an acute angle A works to minimize any gap between the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b> and the rail portion <b>204</b> for a number of reasons. First, because of the acute angle, the rail portion <b>204</b> lies closer to the upper side of mattress <b>16</b> than the lower side of the mattress <b>16</b>. The rail portion <b>204</b> is needed at the upper side to prevent a person from rolling off of the bed <b>24</b>. Second, except for perhaps high tech excessively expensive mechanical arrangements such as found at NASA, mechanical arrangements may loosen over time. The provision of features providing for angle A minimizes the chance that the angle A would become obtuse, i.e., greater than ninety degrees, whereby the rail portion <b>204</b> would extend upwardly and away from the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b>. Third, angle A works in combination with counter attachments <b>404</b> and <b>420</b> where the sections of the counter attachments are readily slideable relative to each other to decrease the effective length of the legs of leg portion <b>204</b>. In other words, as to this third point, mattress <b>16</b> may be hugged more tightly between counters <b>414</b> (or <b>440</b>) and the rail portion <b>204</b> because acute angle A permits the rail portion <b>204</b> to give somewhat. Rail portion <b>204</b> gives somewhat because of the mechanical arrangement of the rail portion <b>204</b> as a whole, because of the mechanical connection between rail portion <b>204</b> and the lower connections <b>226</b>, <b>228</b>, because of the mechanical hinge arrangement <b>220</b> and because of the mechanical frame assembly <b>206</b>. In light of the above three factors, the chances that rail portion <b>204</b> closely confronts the upper face of the mattress <b>16</b> at first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b> are maximized.</p>
  <p num="p-0133"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows rail portion <b>204</b> swung downwardly relative to the leg portion <b>202</b>. When the bed rail <b>200</b> is not in use, such as during daytime hours, the rail portion <b>204</b> is swung downwardly by disengaging rollers <b>272</b> from slots <b>270</b> on the lower connections <b>226</b>, <b>228</b> and pivoting the rail portion <b>204</b> as a whole against the first side <b>26</b> of the box spring <b>18</b>. When swung downwardly, side rails <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> confront stops <b>460</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) of sleeve or receptor <b>246</b>. To place the rail portion <b>204</b> into the upright operating position, rail portion <b>204</b> is swung upwardly such that rollers <b>272</b> roll against peripheral surface <b>294</b> and such that rollers <b>272</b> then snap into detents <b>270</b> under pressure from the coil springs <b>282</b> whereupon the rail portion <b>204</b> is locked relative to the leg portion <b>202</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0134"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows that tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> can be swung from the downward position shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, to the upright operating position shown by first arrowhead <b>462</b>, to the folded position shown by second arrowhead <b>464</b> such that tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> can be swung through about a 270 degree arc relative to leg portion <b>204</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0135"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A</figref>, <b>20</b>B and <b>20</b>C show the preferred embodiment for button <b>402</b> (and for button <b>436</b>).

Button <b>402</b> further includes a second vertical face <b>470</b> opposite of vertical face <b>160</b> and running generally parallel thereto. Button <b>402</b> is a spring that during manufacture is slid into base leg section <b>250</b> and does not need to be affixed to base leg section <b>250</b>. More specifically, button <b>402</b> includes a spring <b>472</b> having a base arm <b>474</b> and an upper arm <b>476</b>. Upper arm <b>476</b> includes a head <b>478</b>. Head <b>478</b> includes the vertical surfaces <b>160</b>, <b>470</b> and the tapering surface <b>158</b>. Head <b>478</b> further includes an upper surface <b>480</b> with which a finger may make contact to depress the head <b>478</b>.

  <p num="p-0136">Vertical surface <b>160</b> of head <b>478</b> can extend through opening <b>480</b> in base leg section <b>250</b> and can further extend through opening <b>412</b> in section <b>406</b>.

Tapering surface <b>158</b> of head <b>478</b> cannot extend through opening <b>480</b> in base leg section <b>250</b> when the spring <b>472</b> is fully extended (not depressed) and can extend through opening <b>412</b> in section <b>406</b> when the spring <b>472</b> is fully extended (not depressed). In other words, when the spring <b>472</b> is fully extended, the intersection or juncture of tapering surface <b>158</b> and vertical surface <b>470</b> is disposed about at the juncture of the upper outer surface of base leg section <b>250</b> and the lower inner surface of section <b>406</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0137"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref> shows that when one attempts to increase the length of leg portion <b>202</b>, a portion of section <b>406</b> forming slot <b>412</b> brings pressure to bear upon vertical surface <b>160</b> of head <b>478</b>, which in turn may slide the button <b>402</b> toward the opposite edge of opening <b>480</b> until vertical surface <b>470</b> of head <b>478</b> abuts such opposite edge of opening <b>480</b> formed in base leg section <b>250</b>, which prevents further sliding of the section <b>406</b> relative to base leg <b>250</b> in the direction of sliding that was attempted. Such further sliding is permitted only by depressing button <b>402</b> by an outside object such as a finger, wherein button <b>402</b> is depressed into base leg section <b>250</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0138"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20C</figref> shows that sliding in the other direction (the direction opposite to that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref>) is permitted, without a finger depressing the button <b>402</b>. Here, upon sliding in such opposite direction, a portion of section <b>406</b> forming slot <b>412</b> brings pressure to bear upon tapering surface <b>158</b>, which automatically depresses the head <b>478</b> into base leg section <b>250</b> and permits such sliding to continue. Accordingly, length of leg portion <b>402</b> is decreased with a minimal amount of effort.</p>
  <p num="p-0139">As noted above, button <b>436</b> includes the same structure as button <b>402</b>. Hence, button <b>436</b> includes the second vertical surface <b>470</b> opposite of vertical surface <b>160</b>. However, whereas tapering surface <b>158</b> of button <b>402</b> faces the direction of counters <b>414</b> and <b>440</b>, tapering surface <b>158</b> of button <b>436</b> faces the direction of the rail portion <b>204</b>. Thus, with counter attachment <b>420</b>, decreasing the length of a leg of leg portion <b>202</b> is relatively easy, because section <b>422</b> encounters the tapering side <b>158</b> of button <b>402</b> when being pushed onto base leg section <b>250</b> and because the tapering surface <b>158</b> of button <b>436</b> encounters the slot edges of slots <b>432</b> when section <b>424</b> is being pushed onto section <b>422</b>. Conversely, increasing the length of counter attachment <b>420</b> is relatively difficult because the vertical surfaces <b>160</b> and <b>470</b> are encountered.</p>
  <p num="p-0140">In operation, the bed rail <b>200</b> is removed from the factory provided box or bag with the fabric wall <b>370</b> already engaged to the frame assembly <b>206</b>. Then tubes <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> may be engaged to each other and further engaged in their respective cradles <b>254</b> to hold the lower end portions of side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> in a spaced apart rigid relationship via the absolute ends of the tubes <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> confronting and abutting the lower connections <b>226</b>, <b>228</b>. Then base leg sections <b>250</b> may be swung such that rollers <b>272</b> engage detents <b>270</b> and such that base leg sections <b>250</b> are set at an acute angle relative to rail portion <b>204</b>. Base leg sections <b>250</b> may then be tucked into the first side <b>26</b> of the bed <b>24</b> between the mattress <b>16</b> and the box spring <b>18</b>. Then either of the counter attachments <b>404</b>, <b>420</b> is engaged to the base leg sections <b>250</b> by sliding the counter attachment into the second side <b>28</b> of the bed <b>24</b> between the mattress <b>16</b> and the box spring <b>18</b> until the counter attachments <b>404</b> (or <b>420</b>) meets with and is engaged to base leg section <b>250</b>. (If counter attachment <b>420</b> is used, medial section <b>422</b> may be first attached to the base leg section <b>250</b> or may be first attached to counter section <b>424</b>). Here, it should be noted that, since slots <b>412</b>, <b>432</b> are provided on only one side of the counter attachments <b>404</b>, <b>420</b>, the counter <b>414</b> (or <b>440</b>) can not be locked into the downward position, such as against box spring <b>18</b>. Then, with the mattress <b>16</b> between the upright and locked rail portion <b>204</b> and the counter <b>414</b> (or <b>440</b>), the counter <b>414</b> and rail portion <b>204</b> are pushed relatively toward each other until the mattress <b>16</b> is tightly hugged and until the rail portion <b>204</b> abuts the upper surface of the mattress <b>16</b> at the first side <b>26</b> of the mattress <b>16</b> such that no gap exists therebetween and a person may safely sleep upon the mattress <b>16</b>. During daytime hours, the rail portion <b>204</b> may be swung down to the out-of-the-way position shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, and then swung upwardly at bedtime to the upright operating and locked position shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. To make the effective length of the leg portion <b>202</b> greater, a relative great amount of effort is required. Mattress <b>16</b> must be taken off of the leg portion <b>204</b> or access must otherwise be gained to buttons <b>402</b> (or <b>402</b> and <b>436</b>) and then buttons <b>402</b> (or <b>436</b>) must be repeatedly depressed as section <b>406</b> (or <b>424</b>) is drawn out of its cooperating leg section and drawn away from rail portion <b>204</b>. To fold the bed rail <b>200</b>, lower tubes <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> are removed from their cradles <b>254</b> and the counter attachments <b>404</b> (or <b>420</b>) are removed from their base leg sections <b>250</b>. Rollers <b>272</b> are unlocked from their detents <b>270</b> and base leg sections <b>250</b> are swung up to be parallel to side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>. Then hinge mechanism <b>220</b> is unlocked by unlocking mechanism <b>342</b> such that upper tubes <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> may be swung to confront and be parallel with side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> and the pair of base leg sections <b>250</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, whereby six tubes are generally parallel with each other.</p>
  <p num="p-0141"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows an embodiment of a bed rail <b>500</b> of the present invention where a wall <b>502</b> having tubing as a rigid component is engaged to the frame assembly <b>206</b>. Wall <b>502</b> includes sheeting <b>504</b> and tubing <b>506</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0142">Sheeting <b>504</b> includes an upper sleeve or tubular portion <b>508</b> for engaging the upper tubes <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> and the hinge mechanism <b>220</b>, a side sleeve or tubular portion <b>510</b> for engaging side tube <b>216</b>, a side sleeve or tubular portion <b>512</b> for engaging side tube <b>218</b>, and a lower multiple sleeve or tubular portion <b>514</b>. Multiple sleeve <b>514</b> includes a sleeve portion <b>516</b> for engaging rigid tubing <b>518</b> that lies in the plane of a sleeping surface <b>519</b> and that confronts the sleeping surface <b>519</b> and first side <b>26</b> of the mattress <b>16</b>. Multiple sleeve <b>514</b> further includes a sleeve portion <b>520</b> for engaging rigid tubing <b>522</b> that confronts the first side <b>26</b> of the mattress <b>16</b> below the sleeping surface <b>519</b>. Multiple sleeve <b>514</b> further includes a sleeve portion <b>524</b> for engaging lower rigid tubes <b>212</b> and <b>214</b>. Sheeting <b>504</b> further includes a resilient mesh <b>525</b> engaged to inner edge portions of sleeves <b>508</b>, <b>510</b>, <b>512</b> and <b>514</b>. Further, for reinforcement, sleeves <b>508</b>, <b>510</b>, <b>512</b> and <b>514</b> are engaged to each other at corner portions.</p>
  <p num="p-0143">Tubing <b>518</b> lies in the plane of the sleeping surface <b>519</b> of mattress <b>16</b>. Tubing <b>522</b> lies between the plane of the sleeping surface <b>519</b> and the plane of the lower nonsleeping face <b>530</b> of mattress <b>16</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0144">Each of tubing <b>518</b> and <b>522</b> includes tubes <b>526</b>, <b>528</b> that are identical to tubes <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>. In other words, each of the tubes <b>526</b>, <b>528</b> includes outer button <b>262</b> that may be operated by inner button <b>264</b>. Further, the tubes <b>526</b>, <b>528</b> engage each other via their inner ends via a female/male connection having aperture <b>302</b>, male end portion <b>304</b>, and button <b>306</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0145">Outer ends of tubes <b>526</b>, <b>528</b> engage cradles <b>532</b> that are identical to cradles <b>254</b>. Cradle or trough is a semi-circular open end receptor having a pair of aligned through holes <b>260</b> for button <b>262</b>. The outer ends of tubes <b>526</b>, <b>528</b>, respective buttons <b>262</b>, <b>264</b>, respective cradles <b>532</b>, and respective holes <b>260</b> may be referred to as first quick connects.</p>
  <p num="p-0146">Cradle or trough <b>532</b> is one-piece and integral with the plastic body <b>536</b> of a height adjustment mechanism <b>534</b>. Plastic body <b>536</b> is generally cylindrical in shape and fits in a snug fashion on its respective side tube <b>216</b> or <b>218</b>. As well as plastic body <b>536</b>, height adjustment mechanism <b>534</b> includes a pin <b>538</b> that ties the plastic body <b>538</b> to side tube <b>216</b> or <b>218</b>. In some cases, pin <b>538</b> is selected to be a set screw that bites into the outer surface of tube <b>216</b> or <b>218</b>, and each of the height adjustment mechanisms <b>534</b> may have a pair of set pins opposing each other. In other cases, pin <b>538</b> may be a permanent or removable rivet that passes diametrically through tube <b>216</b> or <b>218</b>. In other cases, pin <b>538</b> may be a removable screw that passes diametrically through tube <b>216</b> or <b>218</b>, where tubes <b>216</b> and <b>218</b> have a number of openings <b>540</b> at different heights. Height adjustment mechanism <b>534</b>, including plastic body <b>536</b>, pin <b>538</b> and openings <b>540</b>, may be referred to as a second quick connect. Where the pin <b>538</b> is a set screw, incremental height adjustment of tubing <b>518</b> is possible. Where openings <b>540</b> are utilized with a rivet or screw, the degree of height adjustment is dependent upon the number of openings <b>540</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0147">With such height adjustment mechanism or second quick connect <b>534</b>, tubing <b>518</b> may be locked in the plane <b>519</b> of a sleeping surface of a relatively thick mattress <b>16</b> or a relatively thin mattress <b>16</b>. With such height adjustment mechanism or second quick connect <b>534</b>, tubing <b>522</b> may be locked relatively closely or relatively far away from the plane <b>519</b> of a sleeping surface.</p>
  <p num="p-0148">Tubing <b>518</b> and <b>522</b> make the wall <b>502</b> relatively rigid. Tubing <b>518</b> makes the wall <b>502</b> rigid at the plane of the sleeping surface <b>519</b>. Such a rigid feature further maximizes the closing off of any gap that is formed between bed rail <b>500</b> and the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b>. Tubing <b>522</b> makes the wall <b>502</b> rigid at a selected location below, yet relatively close to, the plane of the sleeping surface <b>519</b>. Such a further rigid feature even further maximizes the closing off of any gap that is formed between bed rail <b>500</b> and the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b>. Further, multiple sleeve <b>514</b> has relatively great rigidity overall with tubing <b>518</b> and adjacent tubing <b>522</b>. Such a still further rigid feature yet even further maximizes the closing off of any gap that is formed between bed rail <b>500</b> and the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0149">Another embodiment of the present invention is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref> and includes bed rail <b>550</b>. Bed rail <b>550</b> includes no lower tubes <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> and no cradles <b>254</b>. The three-point connections <b>226</b>, <b>228</b> therefore become two-point connections <b>551</b> (having no cradles <b>254</b>) and otherwise remain the same. Connections <b>551</b> are thereby simplified and manufacturing costs are decreased. Raw material cost is also decreased for bed rail <b>550</b> since lower tubes <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> are no longer required and, it should be noted, the absence of tubes <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> is preferred. It should further be noted that tubing <b>518</b> and <b>522</b> are preferably formed of a metal such as stainless steel or aluminum. Further, multiple sleeve <b>514</b> is reduced in size and includes no sleeve <b>524</b> to further save raw materials.</p>
  <p num="p-0150">With bed rail <b>550</b>, tubing <b>518</b> is preferably set in the plane of the sleeping surface <b>519</b> and tubing <b>522</b> is preferably located between the plane of the sleeping surface <b>519</b> and the plane of the lower face <b>530</b> of the mattress <b>16</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0151">With bed rail <b>550</b>, a generally rectangular space <b>552</b> is thereby formed below tubing <b>522</b> and between side tubes <b>216</b> and <b>218</b>. The provision of this space <b>552</b> maximizes the flow of air and thus oxygen to any gap that would be formed between bed rail <b>550</b> and the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0152">Each of bed rails <b>500</b> and <b>550</b> may include a peripheral strap <b>560</b> for even further minimizing any gap that may be formed between a bed rail and the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b> by drawing bed rail <b>500</b> or <b>550</b>, or more particularly the wall <b>502</b>, against the first side <b>26</b> of the mattress <b>16</b>. Mattress <b>16</b> includes a periphery <b>562</b>. Mattress periphery <b>562</b> includes the first side <b>26</b>, which runs into a head side or end <b>564</b>, which runs into the second side <b>28</b>, which runs into the foot side <b>566</b>, which runs into the first side <b>26</b>. Peripheral strap <b>560</b> engages each of sides <b>26</b>, <b>564</b>, <b>28</b> and <b>566</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0153">Peripheral strap <b>560</b> further includes a locking buckle <b>568</b> for engaging opposite ends of strap <b>560</b> and for drawing wall <b>502</b> against the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b>. The ends of strap <b>560</b> and locking buckle <b>568</b> may be oriented at a number of positions, such as on the second side <b>28</b> of mattress <b>16</b>, or on the outer face <b>570</b> of bed rail <b>500</b> or <b>550</b>, or on the head side <b>564</b> or foot side <b>566</b> of mattress <b>16</b>, or adjacent to side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0154">Peripheral strap <b>560</b> is preferably engaged to the wall <b>502</b> of bed rail <b>500</b> or <b>550</b> instead of to the frame such as to tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, though connection to the frame is possible. The reason why engagement of strap <b>560</b> directly to the wall <b>502</b> is preferred is to draw features of the wall <b>502</b>, such as tubing <b>518</b> and tubing <b>522</b>, directly to the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b>. One means of such an engagement is to avoid wrapping strap <b>560</b> about the outer faces of side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> and instead run the strap <b>560</b> across the inner faces of side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>. Strap <b>560</b> is engaged to the wall <b>502</b> preferably with a weaving engagement utilizing slots <b>572</b> formed in multiple sleeve <b>514</b>. Slots <b>572</b> are preferably located in and between tubing <b>518</b> and tubing <b>522</b>. Slots <b>572</b> are preferably elongate in height such that strap <b>560</b> may be located relatively close to or relatively far from tubing <b>518</b>. A weave engagement between strap <b>560</b> and wall <b>502</b> is preferred because such an engagement is dependent less upon a stitching or gluing or welding engagement that may disengage from the wall <b>502</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0155">It should be noted that bed rails <b>500</b> and <b>550</b>, except as noted above, otherwise include the features of bed rail <b>200</b>, including the features of leg portion <b>202</b> and rail portion <b>204</b>. However, peripheral strap <b>560</b> is a counter such that the counter attachments <b>404</b> and <b>420</b> may or may not be used in combination with peripheral strap <b>560</b>. It can be appreciated that counter attachments <b>404</b> and <b>420</b> work directly on the frame (such as side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>) of the bed rail <b>200</b>, <b>500</b>, <b>550</b> while the counter or strap <b>560</b> works directly on what is within the frame of the bed rail <b>200</b>, <b>500</b>, <b>550</b> such that counter attachments <b>404</b>, <b>420</b> may work in combination with counter or strap <b>560</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0156">As noted above, strap <b>560</b> is engaged to the wall <b>502</b> of the bed rail <b>500</b> or <b>550</b> and runs between side tubes or portions <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> and the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b>. In other words, the side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> include first faces that are oriented toward the direction in which leg portion <b>202</b> extends from wall <b>502</b>, and the strap <b>560</b> confronts these inner first faces of the side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, when the strap <b>560</b> is engaged on the mattress <b>16</b> such that the wall <b>502</b> of bed rail <b>500</b> or <b>550</b> is directly drawn against the mattress <b>16</b> and such that side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> are indirectly drawn against the mattress <b>16</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0157">If desired, the strap <b>560</b> may confront the opposite face of tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> (i.e., the face opposite the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b>) such that the side tubes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> and the frame of the bed rail <b>500</b> or <b>550</b> are drawn directly against the first side <b>26</b> of the mattress <b>16</b> and such that the wall <b>502</b> is indirectly drawn against the first side <b>26</b> of the mattress <b>16</b>. However, such is not preferred because such a structure may leverage the wall <b>502</b> out away from the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0158"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> shows that the preferred angle A (the angle between the leg portion and the rail portion) positions tubing <b>522</b> slightly away from the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b>, positions tubing <b>518</b> directly against the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b> in the plane of the sleeping surface <b>519</b> so as to shut off any gap extending in a plane from said sleeping surface <b>519</b>, and positions tubing <b>208</b> inwardly of the first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b> where first side <b>26</b> of mattress <b>16</b> defines a plane. Where the leg portions and rail portions have a greater acute angle, i.e. closer to a right angle relationship, tubing <b>522</b> may be set more closely to or directly against first side <b>26</b>. In other words, tubing <b>208</b>, <b>518</b> and <b>522</b> are generally in a common plane that intersects a plane defined by the first side <b>26</b> at a single line, with such single line being in the plane of the sleeping surface <b>519</b> and with tubing <b>518</b> preferably being co-axial with such line.</p>
  <p num="p-0159">It can be appreciated that the sleeves <b>516</b> and <b>520</b> are elongate in height such that tubing <b>518</b> and <b>522</b> can be disposed at various heights via the second quick connect <b>534</b> while minimizing a change in the layout or form of sheeting <b>504</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0160">The length of tubing <b>518</b> is about the distance between side tubes <b>216</b> and <b>218</b> and such entire length lies in the plane <b>519</b> of the sleeping surface of mattress <b>16</b>. If tubing <b>518</b> is disposed above such plane, then a gap may form in the plane and below such plane. If tubing <b>518</b> is disposed below such plane, then a gap may form in the plane and below the plane to the height of the tubing <b>518</b>. If such entire length is broken, then a gap may form at the discontinuous portion. If tubing <b>518</b> is disposed at an angle relative to the plane of the sleeping surface <b>519</b>, then a gap is generated at all locations except where the tubing <b>518</b> breaks the plane of the sleeping surface <b>519</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0161">Thus since the invention disclosed herein may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or general characteristics thereof, some of which forms have been indicated, the embodiments described herein are to be considered in all respects illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is to be indicated by the appended claims, rather than by the foregoing description, and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalents of the claims are intended to be embraced therein.</p>
