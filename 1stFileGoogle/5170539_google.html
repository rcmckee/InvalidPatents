    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>The present invention relates generally to buckles, and more particularly to a buckle which is connected to a web or strap and includes a web engagement bar which is slidable with respect to the buckle, spring biased so as to engage and restrict adjustment and removal of the web, and readily accessible for manipulation by means of a user so as to adjust or remove the web.</p>
    <p>2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p>Buckles are typically utilized for releasably joining two portions or free ends of a web or strap where the buckle includes two components which can be releasably connected together in a variety of ways. Each component includes a connecting portion for affixing the free ends of the web to the buckle in an adjustable or non-adjustable manner. Buckles having one component are also employed which typically only adjust the length of a web or strap.</p>
    <p>The adjustable connection defined between the web and the buckle component typically includes two slots formed within a portion of the buckle with a web engagement bar formed between the two slots and about which the web is threaded. The connection is such that portions of the buckle adjacent the slots clamp the web so that under normal conditions of use the web will not slip through the slots and the desired length of the web is retained or maintained. The web is adjustable upon suitable manipulation of the buckle with respect to the strap.</p>
    <p>Another type of adjustable connection includes a web engagement bar which is slidably mounted within an aperture of a connecting portion of the buckle. These types of connections provide better holding of the web and adjustment of the web length. An example of such an adjustable sliding bar buckle is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,150,464 which is assigned to the assignee of the present application. Although such buckles are most effective and have exhibited great commercial success, web engagement occurs only after the web is placed in tension and adjustment of the web length can be bothersome.</p>
    <p>In order to provide web engagement before the web is placed in tension, buckles have been provided with sliding web engagement bars which are spring biased. An example of such a buckle is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3,163,905. That patent discloses an adjustable webbing connector or adaptor having a sleeve and a connector element which slidably fits within one end of the sleeve. A separate elongate retaining spring having a predetermined complex shape is inserted behind the connector element for engagement therewith. The free ends of the spring are flexed so as to be retained within apertures formed within the sleeve so as to provide an inward spring bias of the connector element with respect to the sleeve.</p>
    <p>This type of web connector can be difficult to manipulate and can be unintentionally activated during use. For example since the connector is loosened and the web is shortened merely by pulling upon the free end of the web, unintentional shortening of the web and/or complete unthreading of the web can occur during normal use. Additionally, in order to lengthen the web, the entire connector member must be manipulated against the spring bias while the web is in an adjusted state within the connector which can be difficult for most users, especially if the web is in tension during adjustment. Furthermore, this type of connector has an undesirable wide profile and outwardly extending components which can become caught upon other articles during use.</p>
    <p>It is therefore desirable to provide a buckle having a spring biased sliding web engagement bar which can be easily molded and readily assembled, has a sleek profile without any protruding elements, provides web engagement without the web being placed in tension, is easy to manipulate so as to adjust the length of the web, and restricts unintentional adjustment or unthreading of the web.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention provides a buckle having a sleeve portion including a receiving channel and a web connector member positioned within the channel for cooperation with the sleeve. A spring member is also provided which is integrally formed with the web connector member for providing a spring bias to the web connector member with respect to the sleeve. A web is affixed to the buckle for adjustable cooperation with the web connector member, the sleeve and the spring member, with the web connector member being accessible from the exterior of the buckle for manipulation by means of a user against the force of the spring member so as to adjust or remove the web.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p>Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the buckle and adjustable web connector assembly of the present invention is designated, generally by means of the reference numeral 10. The assembly 10 is typically utilized with a web or strap 12 and preferably only includes three separate parts: a female buckle connector member 14, a male buckle connector member 16 and a slidable web connector member 18.</p>
    <p>The female connector member 14 and male connector member 16 form the buckle portion of t he assembly 10 and are illustrated as a side release buckle. It is to be understood, however, that the invention is applicable to a wide variety of buckles. Additionally, although the slidable web connector 18 of the assembly 10 is illustrated in conjunction with the male connector member 16, the slidable web connector 18 can also be utilized with the female connector member 14 or both the female and male connector members 14 and 16, if desired.</p>
    <p>As FIG. 3 illustrates, the female connector member 14 is preferably formed from a suitable plastic material as a hollow tubular housing or sleeve having a generally rectangular cross-sectional configuration for accepting the plastic male connector member 16 therein. The particular size, shape and material of both the connector members 14 and 16, however, can vary.</p>
    <p>The female connector member 14 includes a first male connector receiving end 20, a second web connecting end 21, an upper surface 22, a lower surface 23 and opposite sides 24, each of which includes a resilient buckle release arm 26. As will be explained in detail below, the receiving end 20 includes a hollow interior 28 which receives the male connector member 16 therein.</p>
    <p>The hollow interior 28 is defined by means of a bottom surface 30, top surface 32 and opposite side surfaces 34. The bottom surface 30 as well as the top surface 32 can be formed with guide channels (not illustrated) for guiding the male connector member 16 into proper engagement within the hollow interior 28.</p>
    <p>The side surfaces 34 are slightly tapered inwardly toward the hollow interior 28 and each includes an aperture 36 therethrough proximate the second web connecting end 21. The apertures 36 are located at predetermined positions so that each release arm 26 can extend through the female connector member 14 apertures 36 so as to engage a portion of the male connector member 16 and enable release of the buckle. In order to prevent over extension of the release arms 26 in an outward direction, the female connector member 14 includes safety engagement tabs 36a proximate the apertures 36 which function as stops against which the release arms 26 can engage.</p>
    <p>Each resilient release arm 26 includes a first proximal end 38, which is integrally formed with the female connector 14, and a second distal end 40, which includes an engagement portion 42. In order to assist in manipulation of the distal ends 40 of the release arms 26, the exterior surface of each distal end 40 can include ribs 44.</p>
    <p>The web connecting end 21 of the female connector 14 includes a web connector bar 46 about which a free end of the web 12 is wrapped. The web 12 is then typically connected to itself such as, for example, by means of sewing, melting or welding as well as with an adhesive or an other desired connector member.</p>
    <p>The male connector member 16, like the female connector 14, is preferably formed from a suitable plastic material as a hollow tubular housing or sleeve having a substantially rectangular cross-sectional configuration. The male connector member 16 includes a base section 48 and a locating section 50 which extends axially outwardly from one end of the base section 48. The locating section 50 is to be inserted into the hollow interior 28 of the female connector 14 and includes three substantially parallel and laterally spaced arms 52, 54 and 56.</p>
    <p>The intermediate arm 54 functions as a guide member for engagement within a guide channel (not illustrated) defined within the female connector member 14. The two outer arms 52 and 56 are resiliently or flexibly formed with the base section 48 for deflection toward the intermediate arm 54. Each outer arm 52 and 56 includes a latching member 58 at a distal end thereof for cooperation with the female connector member 14.</p>
    <p>In order to connect the male connector member 16 to the female connector member 14, the arms 52, 54 and 56 of the locating section 50 of the male connector member 16 are inserted into the hollow interior 28 of the female connector member 14. During insertion, the intermediate arm 54 functions as a guide while the two outer arms 52 and 56 engage the tapered sides 34 of the hollow interior 28 and begin to defect inwardly. Upon continued insertion of the male member 16, the latch members 58 upon the arms 52 and 56 extend through and clear the apertures 36 defined within the sides 34 of the female member and snap outwardly so as to seat behind the walls defining the apertures 36 and lock the male connector member 16 to the female connector member 14.</p>
    <p>In order to disengage the male connector member 16 from the female connector member 14, a user engages the resilient buckle release arms 26 of the female connector member 14 and deflects them inwardly. This causes engagement portions 42 of the release arms 26 to engage the latch members 58 upon the outer arms 52 and 56 of the male connector member 16. Continued deflection forces the latch members 58 inwardly thereby clearing the walls defining the apertures 36 and enabling the male connector member 16 to be removed from the female connector member 14.</p>
    <p>As FIG. 3 illustrates, the base section 48 of the male connector member 16 includes a receiving end 60 disposed opposite the locating section 50. The receiving end 60 includes a slotted aperture 62 in communication with a complementary channel 64 which extends through the base section 48 for receiving the slidable web connector member 18 therein.</p>
    <p>The channel 64 is dimensioned to cooperate with the external dimensions of the connector member 18 and assist in guiding and seating of the connector member 18 therein. As FIGS. 3 and 4 illustrate, a closed end 66 of the channel 64 includes a protruding cam surface 68 proximate its lateral midpoint. The cam surface 68 assists in guiding a portion of the connector member 18 as will be described below. In order to further assist in guiding and to enclose the leading end of the connector member 18, the closed end 66 of channel 64 also may include a cover portion 69, one each upon opposite upper and lower sides of the channel 64.</p>
    <p>As FIG. 3 illustrates, the male connector member 16 also includes a first aperture or through-bore 70 of a substantially rectangular configuration through which the web 12 is passed. The through-bore 70 is positioned substantially transverse to the channel 64 and is defined upon the upper surface of the assembly 10 by means of a first elongate wall portion 72 formed by means of a cross-member 73, an opposite elongate wall portion 74 and a pair of opposite side walls 76 which are shorter than the wall portions 72 and 74.</p>
    <p>As FIG. 2 illustrates, due to the tubular shape of the male connector member 16, the through-bore 70 is defined upon the lower surface of the assembly 10 by means of similar wall members 72a, 74a and 76a. In order to assist in gripping the web 12, the first wall portion 72 and/or 72a can include teeth (not illustrated).</p>
    <p>As FIG. 3 illustrates, the slidable web connector member 18 is substantially rectangular in shape and dimensioned so as to fit snugly within the channel 64 of the male connector member 16. The connector member 18 includes a first end 78, a second end 80, a through aperture 82 and a web connector bar 84.</p>
    <p>In order to provide a spring bias to the connector member 18 with respect to the male connector member 16 after insertion therein, the first end 78 includes two resilient legs 86 extending outwardly therefrom a predetermined distance. As FIGS. 1, 3 and 4 illustrate, these legs 86 engage the cam 68 of the closed end 66 of the channel 64. When the connector member 18 is fully seated within the channel 64, the cam 68 as well as the cover portions 69 guide the legs 86 and prevent the legs 86 from binding without inhibiting the desired spring action. The cover portions 69 also substantially hide the legs 86 and inhibit any outside elements from engaging the legs 86 and restricting their desired movement.</p>
    <p>In order to secure the connector member 18 within the channel 64 against the force of the spring bias provided by means of the legs 86, the web connector bar 84 of the connector member 18 includes an arched or raised portion 88 proximate its lateral midpoint. In order to assist in insertion, the arched portion 88 is preferably tapered from the first end 78 toward the second end 80 of the connector member 18.</p>
    <p>As FIG. 1 illustrates, after the connector member 18 is fully seated within the channel 64, the arched portion 88 engages the first portion 72 of the through-bore 70 so as to restrict removal of the member 18 from the member 16. In order to insert or move the arched portion 88 past the cross-member 73 of the male connector member 16 which defines the first portion 72, the connector member 18 is provided with increased insertion pressure so as to enable the tapered arched portion 88 to gradually flex the cross-member 73 outwardly.</p>
    <p>It is to be noted that, as FIG. 2 illustrates, the web connector bar 84 of the connector member 18 can include a second arched portion 88a on its lower side opposite the arched portion 88 for similar engagement with the portion 72a of the through-bore 70 upon the lower side of the male connector. Additionally, the arched portions 88 and 88a can be replaced with any similar member so long as it can be inserted so as to engage the portions 72 and 72a and retain the connector portion 18 within the channel 64 against the spring bias as desired.</p>
    <p>When the connector member 18 is fully inserted within the channel 64 and sufficient pressure is provided so as to deflect the legs 86, the aperture 82 of the connector member 18 is in alignment with the through-bore 70 of the male connector member 16. The web 12 can then be inserted, as FIG. 5 illustrates, through the through-bore 70, about the web connector bar 84, through the aperture 82, and back out of the through-bore 70 so as to be adjusted to a desired length as will be described in detail below.</p>
    <p>Upon release of the connector member 18, the spring bias of the legs 86 forces the web connector bar 84 to the right with respect to FIG. 4 in the direction of arrow "A" until the arched portion 88 engages the first portion 72 of the through-bore 70 with the web 12, illustrated in dotted outline, captured therebetween. In order to assist in gripping the web 12, the side of the web connector bar 84 facing the first portion 72 of the through-bore 70 can include teeth 90.</p>
    <p>As FIGS. 3 and 4 illustrate, in order to assist in the manipulation of the connector member 18 within the channel 64 against the spring bias, the second end 80 of the connector member 18 can be formed with a push button 92 which can include ribs 94.</p>
    <p>As FIG. 3 illustrates, in order to assemble the connector member 18 within the male connector member 16, the first end 78 of the connector member 18 is inserted into the channel 64 of the member 16. Upon continued insertion and with a slight amount of pressure, the tapered arched portion 88 first flexes the cross member 73 upwardly and then clears the cross member 73 so as to become seated behind it. In this position, illustrated in FIG. 1, the legs 86 are slightly depressed so as to provide the desired spring bias whereby the arched portion 88 is seated against the first portion 72 of the through-bore 70 so as to restrict outward movement of the connector member 18 from the member 16 in accordance with the spring bias.</p>
    <p>In order to connect the web 12 to the assembly 10, the push button 92 is depressed axially inwardly so as to align the aperture 82 of the connector member 18 with the through-bore 70 of the male connector member 16. A free end of the web 12 is then inserted through the through-bore 70, into the space defined between the legs 86 and the connector bar 84, about the web connector bar 84, through the aperture 82, and back out of the through-bore 70. The push button 92 can then be released, whereby the legs 86 move the connector member 18 in the direction of arrow "A" of FIG. 4 so that the arched portion 88 engages the first portion 72 of the through-bore 70 with the web 12 secured therebetween.</p>
    <p>Adjusting or removing the web 12 can be accomplished in one of two ways. First, the push button 92 can be depressed axially inwardly so as to compress the legs 86, move the connector member 18 in the direction opposite to that of arrow "A" of FIG. 4, and align the aperture 82 with the through-bore 70. Thereafter, the web 12 can be readily adjusted or removed as desired.</p>
    <p>It is to be noted that when adjusting the web 12 by depressing the push button 92 axially inwardly adjustment is accomplished in accordance with a mode of operation which is referred to as a "low release angle." A release angle typically refers to the angle between one of the webs 12 and the plane of the buckle. For example, in FIG. 5 the release angle between either one of the webs 12 and the plane of the buckle is relatively small or low and is close to zero. With the vast majority of buckles, however, adjustment of the web 12 is not possible in accordance with such a low release angle since the cooperation between the web connector bar and the gripping components of the buckle prevent any movement of the web 12 while it is in tension. Upon depression of the push button 92, however, the web 12 can be adjusted merely by pulling one lead of the web even when the same is disposed at such a low release angle.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, the assembly 10 can be tilted so as to be aligned with the direction of arrow "B" which is illustrated in FIG. 5 with respect to the direction of pull or tension of the web 12, which typically is in the direction of arrow "A". This tilting operation increases the release angle. After tilting the assembly 10 a sufficient amount in accordance with the direction of arrow "B", which can be less than 90°, one lead of the web 12 then can be pulled in the direction of arrow "A" so as to adjust its length. The web 12 can also be removed in this manner, provided the free end of the web 12 is substantially flat. This type of adjustment is dependent upon the release angle, the amount of spring force provided by means of the legs 86, and the cooperation between the web connector member 18 and male connector member 16.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 6-10 illustrate an alternate embodiment of the present invention and comprises an assembly 110 where common elements are referred to by the same reference numerals. As FIG. 8 illustrates, in this embodiment of the assembly 110, the female buckle connector member 114 and the locating section 150 of the male connector member 116 are substantially the same as the corresponding elements in the embodiment of FIGS. 1-5. Modifications are provided in the embodiment of FIGS. 6-10 with respect to the channel 164 of the receiving end 160 of the male connector member 116 as well as the structure of the slidable web connector member 118 but such modified structures accomplish substantially the same results as in the structural component of the embodiment of FIGS. 1-5.</p>
    <p>As FIGS. 6, 8 and 9 illustrate, within the male connector member 116, the raised cam 68 and cover portions 69 have been eliminated from the channel 164. Additionally, the central portion of the cross member 173 extends outwardly to the end of the receiving end 160 of the male connector member 116. It may also be necessary to slightly modify the dimensions of the channel 164 so as to complement the exterior dimensions of the slidable web connector member 118.</p>
    <p>The legs 86 are eliminated from the leading end 178 of the connector member 118. Additionally, the arched portions 88 and 88a are replaced with one or more detents or nibs 188 which can be tapered if desired. As will be explained below, the detents 188, like the arched portions 88 and 88a, prevent removal of the connector member 118 from the channel 164 of the member 16 against the desired spring force.</p>
    <p>As FIGS. 8 and 10 illustrate, in order to provide such spring force, the second end 180 of the connector member 118, proximate the push button 192, includes two ramps or cammed surfaces 198. The ramps 198 are tapered from a low end proximate the aperture 182 to a high end proximate the push button 192. Thus, the spring bias is provided in the direction of arrow "C" as seen in FIG. 9 by means of the cooperation between the ramps 198 and an exterior edge 173a of the cross member 173 which is opposite the first portion 172 of the through-bore 170.</p>
    <p>As FIG. 8 illustrates, in order to assemble the connector portion 118 to the male connector member 116, the first end 178 of the connector portion 118 is inserted within the channel 164 until the tapered detent 188 engages the, cross member 173. Upon continued insertion of the member 118 in member 116, the detent 188 flexes the cross member 173 slightly outwardly until it clears the cross member 173 and is seated behind it.</p>
    <p>At this position, the ramps 198 are in contact with the cross member 173 and, due to the resiliency of the cross member 173, the spring bias is impressed upon the connector member 118 as seen in the direction of arrow "C" in FIG. 9. Upon depression of the push button 192, the ramps 198 exert further pressure upon the cross member 173 so as to further increase the spring force.</p>
    <p>In order to attach a web 12 to the connector member 118, the push button 192 is depressed until the aperture 182 of the connector member 118 is aligned with the through-bore 170 of the male connector member 116. The web 12 is then threaded about the connector member 118 as in the embodiment of FIGS. 1-5. Upon release of the push button 192, the spring bias provided by means of the cross member 173 and ramps 198 inhibits adjustment and/or removal of the web 12. It is to be noted that the web 12 may also be adjusted by increasing the high release angle as in the embodiment of FIGS. 1-5.</p>
    <p>Modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.</p>
