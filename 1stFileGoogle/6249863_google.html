One embodiment of a remote control includes a printed publication (such as a book, magazine or a catalog) and one or more buttons physically attached to the printed publication to allow users to remotely control use of associated electronic content by a host device. Another embodiment of a remote control has a housing capable of removably holding a storage media encoded with electronic content associated with a button of the remote control. Yet another embodiment of a remote control has at least one data button which permits the user to select the data to be displayed by the host device. An autostart driver in the host device detects insertion of a storage media into a peripheral and automatically starts an application. The application interprets button codes transmitted by the remote control and displays the results or initiates other events. An application development system allows an author to quickly create interactive media applications.</div>

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>This invention relates to an apparatus and method for wireless remote control and use of interactive media and in particular to a remote control including a printed publication and/or a storage media and/or a data button.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading> <p>Today's multimedia devices have sophisticated digital sound and full motion video capabilities which make such devices very suitable for entertainment and educational applications in users' homes. The contents of many printed books are now commercially available as multimedia books and applications encoded in CD-ROMs. Unfortunately, using a multimedia book or application on a host device is not simple at all.</p>
    <p>Most of today's multimedia books lack the feel of printed books and cannot easily be categorized as books on a bookstore shelf. Children, the main targets of multimedia books, usually cannot use such books without adult help. Today's multimedia books have the feel and ease of use of ordinary computer programs. A significant level of computer knowledge is required to “read” a multimedia book, typically by using input devices such as a mouse, computer keyboard or game controller.</p>
    <p>For example, to use a CD-ROM based multimedia book, the user must do the following on an IBM PC host device:</p>
    <p>1. Wired embodiments;</p>
    <p>2. Double circle;</p>
    <p>3. Define removable storage media peripheral;</p>
    <p>1. Start the Windows operating environment;</p>
    <p>2. Insert the CD-ROM into the drive;</p>
    <p>3. Find the appropriate icon and double click on the icon, or,</p>
    <p>If the icon is not available, use the File Manager's menu to select “File” and “Run” and then type the name of the executable file such as “WP”, followed by the Enter key.</p>
    <p>The above procedure is not simple for anyone other than experienced Windows users. A similar procedure must be followed for a Macintosh host device.</p>
    <p>Although in using a game platform such as 3DO platform or a Sega platform it is considerably simpler to start an application, the user is required to toggle the power switch after insertion of a game cartridge, which can be a significant task for a two year old child. A similar toggling of power switch is required for boot-up diskettes for personal computers. Toggling of the power switch forces a user to wait for the personal computer or game platform to go through the boot-up sequence which can last for typically 20 to 30 seconds. Moreover, the user must know that merely inserting a CD-ROM into a peripheral is not enough and that some button must be toggled Qr pressed. Also, the user must know the specific button on the host device such as a power switch or CTL-ALT-DEL for an IBM PC.</p>
    <p>Although some host devices automatically check a disk drive for a file of commands to be run, such checking is done only during power up for booting the operating system. Once a host device has been powered up and is running the operating system, the user must manually start an application (for example by clicking the mouse on an icon or by typing commands such as “MSINSTR”). After the application has started, the user must know and remember the commands necessary to perform various functions of retrieval and display, the names of data accessible by the host device and must make the associations between the commands, functions and data. Another problem with today's multimedia books is that book authors find it difficult to turn ideas for children's books into products because of the inherent complexity of a multimedia book development process.</p>
    <p>Remote controls for television (TV) are well known in the art. Conventional TV remote controls have a rectangular box shape and have function buttons which can cause the TV to switch to a desired channel. However, a user must find out the programs available for viewing (for example by consulting a TV guide to find a desired program), remember the associated channel number and then switch to the desired channel by pressing the appropriate function button on the remote control.</p>
    <p>Children's sound books are well known in the art. Such children's sound books have a button which when pressed plays a sound locally from a speaker embedded in the sound book and electrically connected to the button.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>In accordance with this invention, a remote control for interactive media (henceforth “remote control”), includes remote control circuitry and one or more feature(s) from: a printed publication (such as a book, magazine or a catalog), a storage media holder and a data button. A printed publication remote control in accordance with this invention includes a printed publication having printed content and one or more button(s) connected to a remote control circuitry which allows users to remotely control use of associated electronic content by a host device.</p>
    <p>In accordance with this invention, the remote control circuitry is capable of transmitting a wireless signal to a host device wherein an application running on the host device displays the desired results. The button(s) of the remote control have a visual association with text and/or graphic content on the remote control. The text and/or graphic content and the associated electronic content have a representative (descriptive and/or derivative) association (such as the association between a title or abstract and the electronic content associated with the title or abstract). The associated electronic content and the button(s) have a remote electronic association implemented through a wireless signal encoded with a button code. There is a correspondence between the representative association and the remote electronic association such that the function and/or data indicated by the text and/or graphic content visually associated with the pressed button is used by a host device in displaying associated electronic content. Such a unique combination of printed publication, associated electronic content and one or more button(s) into a single remote control allows the button(s) to be customized depending on the content of the associated electronic content.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of this invention, the associated electronic content is encoded in one or more remote storage media and accessed through a remote server although the associated electronic content is an integral part of the remote control. Such a remote control allows a user to simply push a button on the remote control to cause the host device to access electronic content from a remote server.</p>
    <p>In an alternative embodiment, the associated electronic content is encoded in and accessed from a local storage media (such as, for example, a compact disk (CD), a game cartridge, a floppy disk and a memory card). Such a local storage media can be removably mounted in a holder physically attached to the printed publication in accordance with this invention. The storage media can be inserted into a suitable peripheral of a host device (such as a personal computer, a game machine or interactive television). The additional cost of a storage media is comparable to the costs associated with connect charges and the communication hardware and software necessary for communications between the host device and a remote server.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of this invention, one and only one button is provided in the remote control. The remote control includes a normal book's front cover, a normal book's back cover, both made of cardboard and a single button bound into the back cover. In one specific embodiment, a CD-ROM holder (with a CD-ROM) is physically attached to or integrated into and forms the back cover of the remote control.</p>
    <p>In accordance with this invention, an application's use of associated electronic content (of local or remote storage media) is controlled by pressing a button on the remote control. In one embodiment, pressing a button causes the host device to retrieve the associated electronic content for the next page and display the results of retrieval or appear to the user to “turn” the page (or initiate other actions). A remote control having a single button allows pre-school children to enjoy using associated electronic content or a host device remotely from a distance without need for parental assistance because of simplicity of use.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of this invention the button on the remote control is a large button which encloses all the necessary remote control circuitry in a self-contained unit. In another embodiment of this invention, several buttons are mounted on a printed circuit board (PCB) integrated into the housing.</p>
    <p>Multiple button remote controls permit a wide variety and range of interactivity with a host device. In one embodiment, a remote control has four buttons each button being visually associated with text and/or graphics which have a representative descriptive and/or derivative association with the associated electronic content of a next page, a previous page, beginning (for example a front cover) and end (for example, a back cover). Such a remote control is idiot proof and can be easily used by pre-school children.</p>
    <p>When a user pushes on the surface of a button on a remote control in accordance with this invention, a microcontroller in the remote control wakes up and sends a button code by pulsing an infrared LED. The infrared pulse is received by an infrared receiver connected to a host device microcomputer which interprets the button code to perform the indicated function and/or retrieve the indicated data and display the desired results. Single button control of an application allows even pre-school children to use selections of interactive media accessed via a remote server or from local storage media (such as CD's included in some remote control embodiments).</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, the host device is configured with an autostart driver which starts an application for interpreting button codes from the remote control. The application can access associated electronic content from a remote server or from a local storage media on receipt of a button code from the remote control. Hence, soon after a button on the remote control is pressed, the title screen of the interactive media is displayed by the host device.</p>
    <p>An autostart driver in a host device equipped with appropriate communications hardware and software can be triggered on receipt of a button code to start communicating with a remote server. In the embodiment of the remote control including a removable storage media, the host device autostart driver, on finding a storage media of a remote control in a local peripheral, checks the inserted storage media for a file of a first predetermined name. If the file of the first predetermined name exists, the autostart driver automatically executes the file which in turn starts the appropriate application. The application automatically displays the title screen on the monitor of the host device.</p>
    <p>Therefore when the autostart driver is installed in a host device, compatible applications start up automatically, as soon as a storage media is inserted into the drive. Automatic start-up of an application on insertion of a storage media allows even pre-school children to use applications encoded on a storage media without adult supervision. Therefore using an interactive media in accordance with this invention is made as simple as playing a video cassette recorder (VCR) tape, and even pre-school children can “read” interactive media without adult supervision.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, the same button can indicate a first function/data and alternatively indicate a second function/data at different points during display of electronic contents of an interactive media depending on the specific programming of the application. In such an embodiment, each of such buttons is visually associated with alternative text/graphic content having a representative association with functions and/or data code selections of the associated electronic content.</p>
    <p>A storage media remote control in accordance with this invention includes a housing having human understandable content and a shape and size capable of removably holding a storage media. A storage media is removably but securely held in the housing. Encoded in the storage media is associated electronic content which has a representative (descriptive and/or derivative) association with the human understandable content of the housing.</p>
    <p>One embodiment of a storage media remote control has the form of a CD box with a number of buttons having a remote electronic association with music video selections encoded in a CD removably mounted in the CD box. Buttons on the housing have a visual association with names of music video selections encoded in the CD. Touching a button causes an application running in a host device to retrieve the desired music video selection from the CD and display the retrieved results. In an alternative embodiment, instead of music video selections, music audio selections are encoded in the CD.</p>
    <p>Another embodiment of a storage media remote control has the form of a conventional magazine (henceforth “periodical” remote control). The periodical remote control has a normal magazine front cover and a normal magazine back cover and embedded in the front cover and back cover are several buttons which have a visual association with the printed content of the front cover and back cover. Furthermore, there is a remote electronic association between the buttons in the housing and the associated electronic content encoded in the CD-ROM. Touching a button causes a video recording identified by the text and graphic content to be displayed on a monitor of a host device. In one embodiment of a periodical remote control, membrane buttons are used to identify the desired associated electronic content. In another embodiment, the front and back covers each form flexible touch panel surfaces which permit the X and Y coordinates of the touched location to be determined and thereby identify the desired associated electronic content.</p>
    <p>A data button remote control in accordance with this invention includes a housing having data selecting text and/or graphic content visually associated with a data button, wherein the data button has a remote electronic association with data specific associated electronic content accessible by a host device. The data specific associated electronic content is electronic content which includes data which has a data selecting descriptive and/or derivative association with the data selecting text and/or graphic content of the housing. Therefore a data button in accordance with this invention allows a user to remotely select a desired selection from one or more selections accessible by a host device.</p>
    <p>One embodiment of a data selecting remote control is a picture book remote control for children which has four buttons, each button being associated with printed text/graphic content of an object (such as, for example, a train) which has a video recording selection accessible by the host device. Pressing a button causes the application to display a video recording selection of the desired object (such as a train button for a train video).</p>
    <p>The periodical remote control described above is another embodiment of a data selecting remote control.</p>
    <p>Yet another embodiment of a data selecting remote control has a housing in the shape and size of a globe with membrane buttons attached to the housing, one button on each continent and a video recording selection accessible by the host device. Touching any of the buttons causes a video recording selection on the visually associated continent to be displayed on the host device.</p>
    <p>Yet another embodiment of a data selecting remote control has a rectangular box housing with content representative of a component of the solar system such as “Mars” and “Jupiter” visually associated with corresponding buttons and solar system component selections accessible by a host device. Pressing one of these buttons causes the selected solar system component selection to be used in a video game software.</p>
    <p>An application development system in accordance with this invention allows an author (such as a book writer or an artist) to quickly create interactive applications for children. For example, to create a picture book remote control, the author needs to (1) draw pictures, scan them and store them (2) write captions and store them (3) record sounds and store them and (4) run a compiler engine to generate a run file. Such a simple application development system allows even a person with rudimentary computer knowledge to author applications for remote controls for multimedia books, magazines or audio/video compact disks.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading> <p>In accordance with this invention, a remote control for interactive media includes one or more of the following feature(s): a printed publication, a storage media holder and a data button.</p>
    <p>A printed publication remote control includes a printed publication (such as a book, a periodical, a catalog, a brochure, a postcard, a flyer, a calendar and a document) having human understandable printed text and/or graphic content which is visually associated with one or more buttons attached to the printed publication such that the button(s) allow users to automatically start-up and remotely control use of associated electronic content by a host device.</p>
    <p>A storage media remote control includes buttons physically attached to a housing having a shape and size capable of removably holding a storage media. A storage media removably but securely held in the housing is encoded with associated electronic content which have a descriptive and/or derivative association with the text and/or graphic content of the housing and remote electronic associations with the buttons of the storage media remote control.</p>
    <p>A data button remote control has a data button physically attached to a housing having data selecting text and/or graphic content visually associated with the data button. The data button has a remote electronic association with data specific associated electronic content.</p>
    <p>As used herein, the term “host device” is intended to mean any device which can display to the user associated electronic content encoded in remote and/or local storage media. The host device can be equipped with a peripheral suitable for retrieving associated electronic content encoded in a local storage media. Also, the host device can be equipped with communications hardware and software suitable for retrieving associated electronic content encoded in a remote storage media through a remote server. In accordance with this invention, a host device can be any IBM personal computer (or clone), Macintosh computer, 3DO platform, Sega platform, and an interactive television set top.</p>
    <p>As used herein, the term “storage media” is intended to mean media for storing digital data and/or code such as optical disks (for example compact disks (CDs)), flexible disks (for example 5 ¼ floppy disks), rigid disks (for example hard disks), tapes, game cartridges, memory cards (for example PCMCIA card) or any other media suitable for use in a host device. The term storage media includes such structures and any other structure which performs the function of information storage. In one embodiment the storage media is removable from a host device although other storage media (for example on a remote server) can also be used in accordance with this invention.</p>
    <p>Rather than buttons, alternatively any one of a number of identifying mechanisms can be used (such as the well-known “koala pad” structure or a touch panel) which allows the user to transmit a signal to pull up associated electronic content. The enclosed description is not intended to limit the types of identifying mechanisms which can be used to pull up the desired contents on the storage media but rather it could be illustrative of such mechanisms. Rather than a touch sensitive device even a wand or a pointer can be used in a remote control to identify the desired electronic content to be displayed by a host device.</p>
    <p>In accordance with this invention, associated electronic content include selections which can contain information found in a conventional printed publication such as book, magazine, catalog or other printed document. As used herein, the term “selection” is intended to mean data and/or code and includes a grouping or combination of one or more files such as software, still graphics, picture, text, audio recording, video recording or other data related to one another, suitable for display by a host device. For example, a selection can include the multimedia equivalent of a magazine article or a television program or a digitized song or a video game software program or a spread sheet for financial information. While in one embodiment, data and/or code selections are in multimedia form suitable for use in a multimedia host device, a single media host device can also be used with suitable selections in accordance with this invention.</p>
    <p>As used herein, the term “interactive media” is intended to mean any communication media with which a user can interact such as a computer, an interactive television and a video game machine.</p>
    <p>As used herein, the term “category” is intended to mean one or more selections which have some common characteristic. Examples of categories are “fish” and “birds”. A fish category can contain selections of audio and/or video recordings and text captions relating to, for example, 200 different fish. Another example of a category is a “rock and roll music” category encoded on audio CD, the audio CD containing 20 selections of music, each music selection being representative of rock and roll music.</p>
    <p>As used herein, the term “application” is intended to mean code and/or data which interprets button codes from a remote control. Applications run on host devices. Applications can include selections or alternatively selections and applications can be distinct entities. In one embodiment of this invention applications are distributed to users on storage media housed in a remote control. In one specific embodiment of this invention, an application and associated selections are all integrated into a single executable (such as BUSWEEK.EXE described below). In an alternative embodiment of this invention, applications for retrieving and displaying selections are distributed to users independent of the storage media containing the selections. Applications and/or selections can be distributed to users and accessed by a host device through various communication channels such as phone lines, TV cable and/or satellite link.</p>
    <p>An application in accordance with this invention, includes code which interacts with the user regardless of whether the code is created using a high level presentation development system or is hard coded using a programming language such as C. Furthermore, an application can include either a small run time engine or a larger presentation development software for displaying multimedia selections. In accordance with this invention, an application and/or selection can reside on removable local storage media and/or the host device's storage media and/or a remote server. In other alternative embodiments, a part of the application is resident in the host device, and another part is resident on a remote server's storage media and/or a local storage media.</p>
    <p>As used herein, the term “display” is intended to mean presenting one or more selections by the host device in a form suitable for use by a human on a display device such as a monitor/screen, a speaker/headset or a printer. Display includes running a software program, playing a sound recording (through a speaker/headset), showing a video recording (on a monitor/screen) and printing a graphics image (on a printer). As used herein, the term “use” is intended to be more than mere display and includes any use whatsoever in a host device.</p>
    <p>As used herein, the term “function/data button” is intended to mean a button having a remote electronic association which causes a host device to perform a desired function and/or to retrieve desired data and/or code and to display the results of retrieval on the host device. Function/data button can refer to a function button, a data button or a button having mixed function and data attributes. A function button causes a host device to perform a function. Some examples of a function button are a STOP button, a PRINT button, a left arrow button, a BEGIN button and a SELECT button. A data button in accordance with this invention is visually associated with content on the remote control housing wherein the content indicates to a user one or more categories and/or selections containing specific data on a storage media (local or remote). A data button indicates to a host device, selections containing spcecific data to be retrieved from a local or remote storage media and to be displayed to the user. Some examples of a data button are a TRAIN button, a JUPITER button, an AFRICA button, a BIRDS button, a I WANT TO HOLD YOUR HAND button and a 100 TOP US COMPANIES IN 1993 button. A mixed function and data button can indicate retrieval of data with one or more functions to be performed before and/or after retrieval. Some examples of mixed function and data button are a NEXT PAGE button, an ORBIT button, a LAND button, a SKIP button, a REPEAT button, and an INFO button. A mixed function and data button can also indicate retrieval of code and execution of retrieved code.</p>
    <p>FIG. 1A illustrates a printed publication remote control <b>10</b> for an interactive media in accordance with this invention. Such a printed publication remote control <b>10</b> includes a printed publication <b>11</b> which has printed content. Printed publication <b>11</b> is shown highlighted (double circle) to indicate that the printed publication is an essential feature included in remote control <b>10</b>. Printed content can be any content such as text and/or graphics which is printed on a housing of printed publication <b>11</b>.</p>
    <p>Printed publication remote control <b>10</b> includes one or more function/data button(s) <b>12</b>, remote control circuitry (not shown in FIG. 1A) and associated electronic content <b>13</b>. Function/data button(s) <b>12</b> have a physical attachment <b>14</b>A to printed publication <b>11</b>. Function/data button(s) <b>12</b> have a visual association with the printed content of printed publication <b>11</b>.</p>
    <p>Physical attachment <b>14</b>A and visual association <b>14</b>B can be implemented by gluing a button to a page adjacent to associated printed text and/or graphic content. Printed text and/or graphic content can also be placed directly on an associated button <b>12</b>. In another embodiment, text and/or graphic content are placed far off from an associated button <b>12</b> and visual association <b>14</b>B is formed by one or more printed lines on the printed publication which connect button <b>12</b> and the text and/or graphic content to be associated with button <b>12</b>. The printed text and/or graphic content can indicate user directions (such as “Press the button”), functions and selections (data/code) accessible by a button <b>12</b>. A user can review a printed publication by looking at the graphics and/or reading the text (including reading braille by touching).</p>
    <p>Function/data button(s) <b>12</b> are connected to remote control circuitry capable of causing a function/data button code to be transmitted as a wireless signal from remote control <b>10</b> to a host device (not shown in FIG. <b>1</b>A). On receipt of the wireless signal, the host device can access associated electronic content <b>13</b> to display the desired results indicated by the text and/or graphic content of printed publication <b>11</b>. Therefore, there is a remote electronic association <b>15</b> between function/data button(s) <b>12</b> and associated electronic content <b>13</b>. There is a representative (descriptive and/or derivative) association <b>16</b> between the text and/or graphic content of printed publication <b>11</b> and associated electronic content <b>13</b>.</p>
    <p>Representative association <b>16</b> is implemented when a publisher of a printed publication remote control <b>10</b> makes some indication of associated electronic content <b>13</b> in the printed publication <b>11</b>, which allows a user to use a button <b>12</b> to enjoy associated electronic content <b>13</b> accessible by a user's host device. Representative association <b>16</b> can be descriptive and/or derivative such as the association between a title, an abstract or a graphic and the associated electronic content (for example an icon of a paint brush associated with the software for painting or an icon of a fire truck associated with a video recording of a fire truck).</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of this invention, a publisher publishes the printed content of the printed publication as well as the associated electronic content (remote or local) simultaneously as a single interactive media publication. A printed publication remote control sold to a user includes at least printed publication <b>11</b> with physically attached function/data button(s) <b>12</b> which have a visual association <b>14</b>B with the printed content of printed publication <b>11</b>.</p>
    <p>An associated electronic content <b>13</b> which forms a part of remote control <b>10</b> and which is accessible by a user's host device and is encoded either in a removable storage media local to the host device or in a remote storage media accessible through a remote server. The removable storage media is physically included and removably mounted inside a remote control in accordance with this invention. The remote storage media is not physically included in remote control <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>One embodiment of a remote control for pre-school children is a picture book remote control in which the associated electronic content contains content similar or identical to that of standard children's books such as “Cinderella” and “Pete the Police Car.” Such associated electronic content can include selections containing drawings and/or photographs with text captions as in the print version, and/or audio recordings, and/or video recordings for multimedia host devices.</p>
    <p>FIG. 1B illustrates one embodiment of a picture book remote control <b>100</b> in accordance with this invention. Externally, picture book remote control <b>100</b> looks and feels much like a printed publication, such as a regular children's book. Picture book remote control <b>100</b> includes a printed publication <b>101</b> which has a colorful front cover <b>102</b>. Front cover <b>102</b>, a thick cardboard piece, is a children's book front cover.

    <p>Although in one embodiment, a button is physically attached to the inner side of a back cover of a printed publication, a button in accordance with this invention can be physically attached anywhere on a printed publication including the outer side and inner side of a front cover, a back cover and/or the spine.</p>
    <p>Electronic content <b>133</b>A encoded in CD-ROM <b>119</b> includes selections having a representative (descriptive/derivative) association with the text and/or graphic printed content of printed publication <b>112</b>. In one embodiment, compact disk <b>119</b> is a CD-ROM manufactured by Sony Corp.</p>
    <p>FIG. 1E illustrates use of picture book remote control <b>100</b> with a host device <b>120</b> in accordance with this invention. Host device <b>120</b> is an IBM compatible personal computer (PC) equipped with a monitor <b>122</b>, a speaker <b>124</b>A, a CD drive <b>124</b>B, a keyboard <b>124</b>C, a mouse <b>124</b>D, a printer <b>124</b>E and, a cable/wire <b>124</b>F connected to a jack <b>124</b>G. Host device <b>120</b> includes a signal receiver <b>125</b> connected via a cable <b>126</b> to the microprocessor in host device <b>120</b>. In one specific embodiment of this invention, jack <b>124</b>G is connected to the Internet computer communication network. In other embodiments jack <b>124</b>G is connected to other computer communication networks (such as Information Super Highway, Prodigy and CompuServe). In alternative embodiments, jack <b>124</b>G is connected to a telephone network, a cable TV network or a satellite network.</p>
    <p>A user such as a child can “read” an interactive media on a host device <b>120</b> by pressing button <b>104</b> in remote control <b>100</b>. Pressing remote control button <b>104</b> causes a “turn to next page” function identifying button code to be encoded in a wireless signal and transmitted via a wireless signal link <b>104</b>S to signal receiver <b>125</b>. Signal receiver <b>125</b> transmits the received button code to a microprocessor in host device <b>120</b> via cable <b>126</b>. Host device <b>120</b> interprets the received button code as command to an application running in its microprocessor.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, on receipt of the button code, the application computes the next page address from the current page address, retrieves from associated electronic content <b>133</b>C, the electronic content for the next page and displays the retrieved electronic content on host device <b>120</b>. Such a display causes the image of a title screen on monitor <b>122</b> to be replaced by the image of the first page of the interactive media, or causes a first page image to be replaced by a second page image and so on, depending on the image being displayed when the button code was received.</p>
    <p>In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1E the associated electronic content <b>133</b>C for picture book remote control <b>100</b> is encoded in remote storage media <b>132</b>C connected to a remote server <b>131</b>. Associated electronic content <b>133</b>C includes a category of selections for “FRED THE FIRE ENGINE” which is used with remote control <b>100</b> having the text printed content <b>103</b>A “FRED THE FIRE ENGINE.”</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of this invention, a portion of the remote control button code determines the associated electronic content referenced by the button of a remote control. For example, in one embodiment, in a remote control button code <b>0027</b>, the number <b>27</b> uniquely identifies the associated electronic content <b>133</b>C containing the story of “FRED THE FIRE ENGINE” while the number <b>00</b> indicates the title screen.</p>
    <p>A host device <b>120</b> can log into remote server <b>131</b> and use remote control button code <b>0027</b> to retrieve associated electronic content <b>133</b>C, (which has a representative association with text printed content <b>103</b>A) and display the title screen. In one embodiment of this invention each successful retrieval of associated electronic content by a user's host device causes the remote server to bill the user for the costs associated with use of the associated electronic content.</p>
    <p>Also shown in FIG. 1E are electronic contents <b>133</b>A, <b>133</b>B and <b>133</b>D encoded on storage media <b>132</b>A, <b>132</b>B and <b>132</b>D which are associated with other picture book remote controls. Each such picture book remote control can have a button capable of transmitting a button code which distinctly identifies one of the electronic contents <b>133</b>A, <b>133</b>B and <b>133</b>D and the function/data being referenced. In an alternative embodiment, a single remote control includes multiple buttons, with each button distinctly identifying a different one of electronic contents <b>133</b>A, <b>133</b>B, <b>133</b>C and <b>133</b>D (as in FIG. <b>6</b>B).</p>
    <p>In the embodiment of FIG. 1E, remote server <b>131</b> is accessible to host device <b>120</b> via the TV cable system <b>130</b> connected to cable jack <b>124</b>G. Although in the embodiment of FIG. 1E, electronic contents <b>133</b>A, <b>133</b>B, <b>133</b>C and <b>133</b>D are resident on distinctly separate storage media and accessed through a single server, such electronic contents can all be resident on a single storage media or each can be accessible through different servers in accordance with this invention.</p>
    <p>In one specific embodiment of this invention, host device <b>120</b> is an IBM compatible personal computer from Astrix Computer Corporation, 1546 Centre Pointe Drive, Milpitas, Calif. 95035. Host device <b>120</b> includes multimedia hardware such as a full motion video card, “Real Magic” available from Sigma Designs, Inc., 47900 Bayside Parkway, Fremont, Calif. 94538. The Real Magic card implements an audio/video compression algorithm compatible with MPEG/1 specification available from the Motion Pictures Expert Group. Host device <b>120</b> also includes a commercially available CD drive, NEC CDR/84 available from NEC Corporation. In an alternative embodiment of this invention, host device <b>120</b> includes the full motion video card “ProAudio Spectrum 16” available from Media Vision Inc., 47300 Bayside Parkway, Fremont, Calif. 94538.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of this invention host device <b>120</b> is a Macintosh personal computer (PC) equipped with a monitor, a floppy drive, a speaker, a headset, a signal receiver, a CD drive and a keyboard.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of this invention, remote control <b>100</b> includes a signal transmitter (as described below) for transmission of a button code from button <b>104</b> as a wireless signal, which can be received by signal receiver <b>125</b>. In one embodiment, cable <b>126</b> is an RS 232 serial cable. In the embodiment described above, each time button <b>104</b> is pressed, a function identifying button code is transmitted by remote control <b>100</b> and an application running in host device <b>120</b> retrieves the electronic content for the next page until reaching the back cover after which, on the next retrieval and display the host device goes back to the beginning and displays the title screen.</p>
    <p>FIG. 1F shows a picture book remote control <b>115</b> being used with a host device in the form of a game machine platform <b>150</b>. Text content <b>116</b>F and graphic content <b>116</b>G are visually associated with button <b>116</b>C on front cover <b>116</b>. A game cartridge is removably mounted inside a holder in interactive book remote control <b>115</b> (as shown in FIG. <b>6</b>D).</p>
    <p>Game machine platform <b>150</b> includes a television <b>141</b>, which has a screen (also called a “monitor”). Game machine platform <b>150</b> also includes a game machine <b>142</b> connected to television <b>141</b> by a cable <b>145</b>C. Game machine <b>142</b> includes a built-in receiver <b>143</b>, a modem <b>144</b>A, a fax card <b>144</b>B, a battery protected memory card <b>144</b>C and game cartridge receiver <b>149</b>. Game cartridge receiver <b>149</b> is suitable for retrieving the electronic contents encoded in a game cartridge. Game machine <b>142</b> is connected via a cable <b>145</b>A to a telephone jack <b>146</b>. Game machine <b>142</b> is also connected to a satellite antennae <b>148</b> by a cable wire <b>145</b>D.</p>
    <p>Although a game machine <b>142</b> is being described and shown in FIG. 1F, other host devices such as an interactive television set top can be used instead of game machine <b>142</b> in accordance with this invention.</p>
    <p>Modem 144A of game machine <b>142</b> permits a game machine platform <b>150</b> to communicate with devices connected via a modem to the telephone network (not shown). Game machine platform <b>150</b> supports applications involving multiple users participating in a single video game application. Alternatively applications which permit a user to purchase various products by merely pressing a button in a remote control (as described below) can be used in game machine platform <b>150</b>.</p>
    <p>A telephone <b>147</b> is connected by phone cable <b>145</b>B to phone jack <b>146</b> and permits a user to have a voice link with another user. Alternatively telephone <b>147</b> can be used by a user to communicate with a publisher of interactive media or an advertiser of products in a periodical remote control (as described below). In one embodiment of this invention, a user's credit card number and password are saved in battery protected memory card <b>144</b>C for use by an application to order an advertised product when a user issues a buy command using a remote control (as described below in reference to application 860).</p>
    <p>One advantage of combining a button and a printed publication into a single remote control as described above is that a button of the remote control can be uniquely customized depending on the specific text and/or graphic content of the printed publication and depending on the associated electronic content.</p>
    <p>Another advantage of a printed publication remote control is that such a remote control can be sold through the existing normal printed publication channels such as a book store, a magazine stand and direct mail order.</p>
    <p>A picture book remote control with one and only one button which causes page turning and caption reading on a host device allows even preschool children to enjoy interactive multimedia CD-ROM books on a host device without need for parental assistance.</p>
    <p>In accordance with this invention, a user, such as a two year old child, can remove storage media <b>119</b> (FIG. 1D) from housing <b>118</b> of a remote control <b>110</b> and insert storage media <b>119</b> into a host device's peripheral <b>124</b>B (FIG. <b>1</b>E). As soon as storage media <b>119</b> is inserted, an application automatically starts and the interactive media's title screen is retrieved from storage media <b>119</b> and displayed on monitor <b>122</b> of host device <b>120</b>.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, in a remote control associated with electronic content encoded on a remote storage media, as soon as a button (such as button <b>104</b> of remote control <b>100</b>) is touched by a user, an application automatically starts on host device <b>120</b> and communicates with a remote server to access the remote storage media. Either some portion or all of an associated electronic content <b>133</b>C is retrieved by the application and the title screen is displayed on monitor <b>122</b> of host device <b>120</b>. Also, in some embodiments audio is displayed through speaker <b>124</b>A. The display of audio depends on content of the selection available to the application running in host device <b>120</b>.</p>
    <p>Next, if button <b>104</b> on remote control <b>100</b> is pressed, a book “opens” on monitor <b>122</b> (irrespective of whether local or remote storage media is being used). After the title screen, a first page <b>160</b> is displayed on monitor <b>122</b> (FIG. <b>1</b>G). First page <b>160</b> includes graphic content <b>164</b> illustrating the fire truck and text content <b>162</b> which reads “Fred is sleeping at the fire station.”</p>
    <p>When button <b>104</b> is pressed again, a sound recording of text content <b>162</b> is displayed through speaker <b>124</b>, while graphic content <b>164</b> and text content <b>162</b> continue to be displayed on monitor <b>122</b>. Next time button <b>104</b> is pressed, the text and graphic content for page 2 are displayed (not shown). In this manner, preschool children can now enjoy interactive media using just one simple button on the remote control.</p>
    <p>In an alternative embodiment, pressing a button of a remote control a second time turns the page on monitor <b>122</b> instead of the text content being read to the user. In other alternative embodiments, other multimedia events such as full motion video, sound effects and multiple choice questions are presented to a user depending on when a button of a remote control is pressed and the programming of the selection and application.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of this invention, a picture book remote control can be created from off-the-shelf children's sound books such as “Fred the Fire Engine”, “Cinderella” and “Pete the Police Car”, commonly available in bookstores such as Barnes &amp; Noble Bookstore, 3600 Stevens Creek Boulevard, San Jose, Calif. 95117.</p>
    <p>Children's sound books contain one or more sound buttons which, when pressed, play sound (for example, the sound of a fire engine) through a speaker inside the sound book. Such a children's book is modified to create a picture book remote control by removing all pages between the front and back covers, modifying the sound buttons and optionally gluing a CD holder on the inside back cover of the sound book. The sound buttons are modified by removing the existing sound electronics and substituting the remote control circuitry as described below. The CD holder can be any commercially available CD holder such as DIGIPAK available from AGI Inc. 153 2nd Street, Los Altos, Calif. 94022 (415) 949-5870.</p>
    <p>Although one embodiment of a picture book remote control is created by modifying a children's sound book, in another embodiment of this invention, a picture book remote control is mass produced from various new materials. Although in one embodiment, a storage media holder is physically attached to a printed publication, in another embodiment, the holder is formed integral with the printed publication and the button is physically attached to the holder (FIG. <b>6</b>H). In an alternative embodiment, the buttons are formed integral with the housing of a remote control (FIG. <b>7</b>D).</p>
    <p>An interactive media remote control with multiple buttons permits a wide variety and range of interactivity between a user and a host device. The multiple buttons are mounted on a flexible printed circuit board which is bound into the housing of the printed publication to form a remote control for an interactive media. The number of buttons included in a remote control depends on the associated electronic content. Simple multiple button remote controls (for example for two year olds) can have two, three or four buttons. More advanced remote controls can have an entire computer keyboard.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 2A and 2B are illustrations of one embodiment of a multiple button remote control <b>200</b> in the closed and opened positions respectively. Remote control <b>200</b> includes a printed publication <b>210</b> which has a front cover <b>221</b> and a back cover <b>222</b> joined by a spine <b>223</b>. Outerside <b>221</b>A of front cover <b>221</b> has text printed content <b>224</b> “THE THREE LITTLE PIGGIES”. Remote control <b>200</b> has a number of buttons: NEXT button <b>225</b>A, PREVIOUS button <b>225</b>B, BEGIN button <b>225</b>C and END button <b>225</b>D, all of which are mounted on back cover <b>222</b> of printed publication <b>210</b>.</p>
    <p>Remote control <b>200</b> also includes remote control circuitry <b>226</b> and transmitter <b>226</b>A such that when any of buttons <b>225</b>A, <b>225</b>B, <b>225</b>C and <b>225</b>D is pressed, a corresponding function identifying button code is transmitted via transmitter <b>226</b>A. Remote control <b>200</b> has a height H<sub>p</sub>=7.85 inch (FIG. 2A) with front cover <b>221</b> having a length L<sub>p</sub>=6.6 inch, back cover <b>223</b> having a length L<sub>B</sub>=8.5 inch and spine <b>223</b> having a width T<sub>S</sub>=0.35 inch (FIG. <b>2</b>B).</p>
    <p>Mounted on inner side <b>221</b>B of front cover <b>221</b> is a CD ROM holder <b>228</b> in which is removably mounted CD ROM <b>229</b>. On inner side <b>222</b>A of back cover <b>222</b> is text and/or graphic printed content <b>227</b> which is part of printed publication <b>210</b>. Encoded in CD ROM <b>229</b> is associated electronic content having a representative association with text and/or graphic printed content <b>227</b> and text printed content <b>224</b> of printed publication <b>210</b>.</p>
    <p>Physically attached to a surface of each of buttons <b>225</b>A, <b>225</b>B, <b>225</b>C and <b>225</b>D is a corresponding text content <b>230</b>A (“NEXT”), <b>230</b>B (“PREVIOUS”), <b>230</b>C (“BEGIN”) and <b>230</b>D (“END”). For instance, when NEXT button <b>225</b>A is pressed, remote control circuitry <b>226</b> causes a remote control button code indicating the next page to be transmitted by transmitter <b>226</b>A to a host device <b>120</b> (FIG. <b>1</b>E). The remote control button code is interpreted by host device <b>120</b> which computes the next page from the page currently being displayed and then retrieves the corresponding electronic content from CD ROM <b>229</b>.</p>
    <p>A similar previous page function is implemented on pressing PREVIOUS button <b>225</b>B. When BEGIN button <b>225</b>C is pressed, host device <b>120</b> looks up the starting address for the selection, “THREE LITTLE PIGGY'S” and retrieves the electronic content for the title screen from CD ROM <b>229</b>. Similarly, host device <b>120</b> retrieves the electronic content for the back cover when button <b>225</b>D is pressed. The results of retrieval are then displayed to the user by host device <b>120</b>. Therefore buttons <b>225</b>A and <b>225</b>B allow a user to sequentially access the pages of selection “THE THREE LITTLE PIGGY'S” whereas buttons <b>225</b>C and <b>225</b>D allow the user to directly access the beginning or the end of the selection.</p>
    <p>Although picture book remote controls <b>100</b>, <b>115</b> and <b>200</b> have been described above as printed publication remote controls, they can also be described as storage media remote controls (described below).</p>
    <p>FIG. 3A is an illustrative perspective view of a button <b>301</b> for a single button remote control (such as button <b>104</b> shown in FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C). In the embodiment of FIG. 3A, button <b>301</b> is a large plastic button that contains all remote control circuitry enclosed in a self-contained unit. However, remote control circuitry can also be provided outside a button (FIGS. <b>2</b>B and <b>7</b>A).</p>
    <p>Button <b>301</b> has an enclosure wall <b>308</b> (made of red plastic transparent to infrared light in one embodiment of this invention). Button <b>301</b> has a button surface <b>302</b> which is spring mounted and surrounded by enclosure wall <b>308</b>. A graphic content <b>302</b>A of a fire truck is physically attached to button surface <b>302</b>.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 3B and 3C are the elevation and plan views of button <b>301</b> of FIG. <b>3</b>A. As shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B, surrounded by enclosure wall <b>308</b> is remote control circuitry including a round printed circuit board (PCB) <b>303</b> with electronic components, such as an infrared light emitting device (LED) <b>304</b> and a microcontroller <b>305</b>. Infrared LED <b>304</b> is mounted at a location that ensures proper transmission of infrared signals through button <b>301</b>. Button <b>301</b> also includes a switch activating protrusion <b>306</b> attached to PCB <b>303</b>. Although in FIG. 3B protrusion <b>306</b> is attached to PCB <b>303</b>, in another embodiment of this invention, protrusion <b>306</b> is attached to button surface <b>302</b>.</p>
    <p>Enclosure wall <b>308</b> acts as a guide for button surface <b>302</b> to permit reciprocating motion of protrusion <b>306</b> with respect to PCB <b>303</b>. In the embodiment of FIG. 3C microcontroller <b>305</b> is mounted in die form on PCB <b>303</b> to save space and ensure compact nature of button <b>301</b>. Also, button <b>301</b> is powered by two button cells <b>307</b>A and <b>307</b>B (FIG. <b>3</b>C).</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, infrared LED <b>304</b> is mounted facing a transparent surface such as enclosure wall <b>308</b> (FIG. 3B) (or opposite a transparent button surface in an alternative embodiment). Button <b>301</b> can be formed from a sound button of an existing children's book by drilling a hole in button surface <b>302</b> of button <b>301</b> to accommodate infrared LED <b>304</b>. Alternatively, infrared LED <b>304</b> can be mounted facing a hole in an enclosure wall <b>308</b>, if necessary.</p>
    <p>In accordance with this invention, instead of microcontroller <b>305</b>, other logic circuits can be used such as an ASIC, a PLD or a FPGA (appropriately programmed). A microprocessor can also be used if desired for this function, although the cost will be higher than the cost of a microcontroller.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, instead of infrared LED <b>304</b>, other types of wireless signal transmitters such as a radio frequency transmitter or an ultrasonic transmitter can also be used in accordance with this invention.</p>
    <p>Any sized button can be used in accordance with this invention. In one specific embodiment, remote control button <b>301</b> is one inch in diameter. In another embodiment the whole surface of a front cover of a remote control is a button (FIG. <b>7</b>D).</p>
    <p>Microcontroller <b>305</b> is normally in SLEEP mode. If a user pushes on button surface <b>302</b> of button <b>301</b> by a distance sufficient for protrusion <b>306</b> to contact button surface <b>302</b>, microcontroller <b>305</b> wakes up and sends a single button code by pulsing infrared LED <b>304</b>. Microcontroller <b>305</b> then immediately returns to SLEEP mode even before button <b>301</b> is released by the user.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of this invention, the button code sent by microcontroller <b>305</b> corresponds to the pressing of a mouse button on a mouse connected to a host device. In one specific embodiment of a picture book remote control, the button code sent by the remote control corresponds to the button code generated by pressing a left mouse button in a mouse of an IBM personal computer (PC). However, in alternative embodiments, the button's switch (formed by protrusion <b>306</b> and PCB <b>303</b>) is connected to other pins on microcontroller <b>305</b> so that a different button code is generated.</p>
    <p>In accordance with this invention, any number can be used as a button code as long as the corresponding application can recognize the received number and perform the desired function (such as “STOP”). Although in one embodiment of this invention, the button code generated by each button is unique, in other embodiments, the same button code can be generated by more than one button to indicate the same desired function and/or data.</p>
    <p>One advantage of enclosing remote control circuitry inside button <b>301</b> is that the switch and circuitry are combined into a single unit resulting in simplicity of design and cost savings. Also, a large sized button allows even pre-school children to easily use a remote control for an interactive media.</p>
    <p>FIG. 4A is an illustrative block diagram of one embodiment of a remote control <b>400</b> for an interactive media being used with a host device <b>420</b>. Remote control <b>400</b> includes a button <b>401</b> which includes a switch <b>402</b>, and remote control circuitry <b>410</b> connected to each other by switch output line <b>403</b>. Remote control circuitry <b>410</b> includes a microcontroller <b>404</b> and a signal transmitter <b>406</b>. Switch <b>402</b> is connected by switch output line <b>403</b> to an input pin <b>404</b>I of microcontroller <b>404</b>. An output pin <b>404</b>O of microcontroller <b>404</b> is connected by transmitter input line <b>405</b> to signal transmitter <b>406</b>.</p>
    <p>When button <b>401</b> is pressed by a user, microcontroller <b>404</b> detects the closure of switch <b>402</b> via switch output line <b>403</b>. Microcontroller <b>404</b> then sends a signal to signal transmitter <b>406</b> via transmitter input line <b>405</b>. In one particular embodiment, signal transmitter <b>406</b> is an infrared transmitter such as an infrared LED <b>304</b> (above).</p>
    <p>Signal transmitter <b>406</b> transmits a wireless signal <b>407</b> to a host device <b>420</b> (such as host device <b>120</b> of FIG. <b>1</b>E. Host device <b>420</b> senses wireless signal <b>407</b> in a signal receiver <b>422</b>. Signal receiver <b>422</b> is connected by receiver output line <b>423</b> to microcontroller <b>424</b>. On receipt of a signal from remote control <b>400</b>, signal receiver <b>422</b> sends a signal on receiver output line <b>423</b> to microcontroller <b>424</b>. Microcontroller <b>424</b> is connected to a microcomputer <b>426</b> by microcomputer input line <b>425</b>.</p>
    <p>Microcomputer <b>426</b> includes several components such as a central processing unit <b>427</b>A (for example, Intel microprocessor 80486), a read only memory (ROM) <b>427</b>B in which is stored a basic input output system (BIOS), a display device <b>433</b> and main memory <b>435</b>. Main memory <b>435</b> contains an autostart driver <b>436</b>, and an application <b>437</b>. Microcomputer <b>426</b> also has removable storage media peripherals <b>428</b> and <b>432</b> containing storage media <b>428</b>M and <b>432</b>M respectively. Storage media <b>428</b>M is a local storage media which was removed by a user from a remote control and inserted into removable storage media peripheral <b>428</b>, storage media <b>428</b>M includes three files: DISGOKEY.EXE <b>429</b>, DISGO.BAT <b>430</b>, and BUSWEEK.EXE <b>431</b> (described below). Storage media <b>432</b>M is a boot disk containing an operating system such as Microsoft™ DOS. All the components of microcomputer <b>426</b> are operatively coupled to central processing unit <b>427</b>A through a bus, such as the well known ISA bus (not shown).</p>
    <p>Also shown in FIG. 4A is a communication line <b>438</b> connecting host device <b>420</b> to a remote server <b>439</b>. Remote server <b>439</b> allows host device <b>420</b> to access remote storage media <b>439</b>M which can be encoded with associated electronic content for remote control <b>400</b>.</p>
    <p>Microcomputer <b>426</b> passes to application <b>437</b> any button codes received from microcontroller <b>424</b>. Application <b>437</b> interprets the received button code as a user command such as a command to turn pages in the currently displayed selection. Application <b>437</b> is a memory resident version of the executable application encoded in storage media <b>428</b>M (such as BUSWEEK.EXE <b>431</b> described below).</p>
    <p>FIG. 4B is an illustrative circuit diagram of remote control circuitry <b>410</b> for one embodiment of a button <b>401</b> described above. Remote control circuitry <b>410</b> is formed on a PCB <b>303</b> supported on a housing of one embodiment of a remote control, as described above. Microcontroller <b>404</b> of remote control circuitry <b>410</b> has various pins including VB<b>2</b> power pin <b>404</b>A, VB<b>1</b> power pin <b>404</b>B and FB<b>3</b> reset pin <b>404</b>C which are tied to the positive terminal of power supply <b>307</b> (formed by batteries <b>307</b>A and <b>307</b>B connected in series). Microcontroller <b>404</b> is also connected through a X<b>1</b> pin <b>404</b>J and X<b>2</b> pin <b>404</b>H to a resonator crystal <b>445</b> which causes an oscillator in microcontroller <b>404</b> to oscillate (in one embodiment at 3.58 MHz).</p>
    <p>Signal transmitter <b>406</b> (dotted line) includes an npn transistor <b>442</b>, an LED <b>443</b> and a resistor <b>444</b>. Transmitter input line <b>405</b> connects the base of transistor <b>442</b> to SOUT/CD/FB<b>2</b>/C<b>4</b> pin <b>404</b>O of microcontroller <b>404</b>. The collector of transistor <b>442</b> is connected to the cathode of LED <b>443</b>. The anode of LED <b>443</b> is connected to one end of resistor <b>444</b>. The other end of resistor <b>444</b> is connected to the positive terminal of power supply <b>307</b>. The emitter of transistor <b>442</b> is connected to the negative terminal of power supply <b>307</b>. The VSS pin <b>404</b>G of microcontroller <b>404</b> is also connected to the negative terminal of power supply <b>307</b>.</p>
    <p>Initially, the CR/RB/C<b>2</b> input pin <b>404</b>I of microcontroller <b>404</b> is internally pulled down to ground by an internal resistor while the enable EB pin <b>404</b>E of the microcontroller is forced high. Therefore microcontroller <b>404</b> is triggered when switch <b>402</b> is depressed sufficiently to short CR/RB/C<b>2</b> pin <b>404</b>O to EB pin <b>404</b>E and force pin <b>404</b>I high. Such a closure of switch <b>402</b> causes a button interrupt to awaken software running in microcontroller <b>404</b>. The software rapidly pulses transistor <b>442</b> via SOUT/CD/FB<b>2</b>/C<b>4</b> pin <b>404</b>O. Transistor <b>442</b> in turn causes infrared LED <b>443</b> to transmit a modulated infrared signal <b>407</b>.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, infrared signal <b>407</b> has the form of an infrared RS232C serial link at 1200 baud modulated with a 40 KHz carrier with 1's represented by 40KHz square wave (25 pulses to 600 sec interval) and 0's by zero volts. Approximately 800 m Amp of current flow through LED <b>443</b>, limited only by resistor <b>444</b>. The current through LED <b>443</b> is limited by resistor <b>444</b> to approximately 400 m Amp. In another embodiment two transistors are used to increase current through LED <b>443</b> as described in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/076,032 filed Jun. 15, 1993 incorporated herein in its entirety.</p>
    <p>In the embodiment of FIG. 4B, microcontroller <b>404</b> is a Motorola Microcontroller, M68HC05K0 available from Motorola Inc., Semiconductor Products Sector 2100 E. Elliot Road, Tempe, Ariz. 85284. In FIG. 4B transistor <b>442</b> is MMBT4401 also available from Motorola, Inc. Infrared LED <b>443</b> is NEC-SE1003C available from NEC Electronics, Inc., 475 Ellis Street, Mountain View, Calif. 94043, resistor <b>444</b> is a 1 ohm resistor, resonator <b>445</b> is a 3.58 MHz resonator Part # KBR 3.58MKS available from Kyocera America, 8611 Balboa Avenue, San Diego, Calif. 92123. Power supply <b>307</b> is two 1.5 volt watch batteries connected in series, Part # GR927 available from Panasonic Industrial Co., 1600 McCandless Drive, Milpitas, Calif. 95035 (408) 946-7481. Switch <b>402</b> is Part # JPM 1110 available from SMK Electronics Corp., 4633 Old Ironsides Drive, Suite 403, Santa Clara, Calif. 95054.</p>
    <p>One advantage of the circuit of FIG. 4B is its extremely low power consumption which allows the use of watch batteries <b>307</b>A and <b>307</b>B and results in a compact size. Also, use of microcontroller <b>404</b> with software which emulates the Microsoft mouse (FIG. <b>4</b>C and Appendix A), eliminates the need for a special driver to generate button codes for transmission to a host device.</p>
    <p>FIG. 4C is an illustrative flow chart of the software running in microcontroller <b>404</b> of FIG. <b>4</b>A. As shown in FIG. 4C, microcontroller <b>404</b> initializes variables in step <b>451</b> and then goes to step <b>453</b> via branch <b>452</b>. Microcontroller <b>404</b> then executes steps <b>453</b> and <b>456</b> in an infinite loop as shown by branches <b>452</b>, <b>455</b> and <b>457</b>. In step <b>453</b>, microcontroller <b>404</b> waits for a button interrupt in a SLEEP mode. Microcontroller <b>404</b> stays in step <b>453</b> as shown by branch <b>454</b>, until a button interrupt is received.</p>
    <p>As noted above, a button interrupt is generated when switch <b>402</b> is closed by a user pressing on a button surface of button <b>401</b> (FIG. <b>4</b>A). Once a button interrupt is received, microcontroller <b>404</b> goes via branch <b>455</b> to step <b>456</b>. In step <b>456</b>, microcontroller <b>404</b> sends a button code by rapidly pulsing infrared LED <b>443</b>. In one specific embodiment, a button code includes a button press code and a button released code. The button released code is sent immediately following the sending of the button pressed code. After sending infrared signal <b>407</b> (FIG. <b>4</b>A), microcontroller <b>404</b> goes back via branches <b>457</b> and <b>452</b> to step <b>453</b> where microcontroller <b>404</b> continues in the SLEEP mode.</p>
    <p>In an alternative embodiment of this invention, instead of microcontroller <b>404</b> transmitting a button released code immediately after a button pressed code, microcontroller <b>404</b> first transmits the button pressed code and when the button is released, a button released code is transmitted, as shown by the software listed in Appendix A. The Appendix A software can be compiled and linked by Motorola M68HC705KICS In-Circuit Simulator available from Motorola, Inc. (at above address).</p>
    <p>FIG. 4D is an illustrative circuit diagram for one embodiment of a signal receiver <b>422</b> in accordance with this invention. Signal receiver <b>422</b> is described in detail in the co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/076,032 and filing date Jun. 15, 1993, referenced above, with 5.1K ohm resistor <b>463</b>A added to pull TXD to −5V when transistor <b>470</b> is off. Pin <b>3</b> on connector <b>469</b> is RXD.</p>
    <p>Signal receiver <b>422</b> includes an infrared photodiode <b>461</b>, a microcontroller <b>424</b>, a resonator <b>473</b>, FETs <b>404</b> and <b>470</b>, diodes <b>465</b> and <b>466</b>, LED <b>472</b>, capacitor <b>468</b>, resistors <b>463</b>, <b>463</b>A and <b>471</b> and a voltage regulator <b>467</b>. Signal receiver <b>422</b> derives VCC power from the serial port of a microcomputer <b>426</b> (FIG. <b>4</b>A). In one embodiment, microcontroller <b>424</b> is the Motorola Microcontroller M68HC05KO (above address).</p>
    <p>Resonator <b>473</b> is a 3.58 MHz resonator Part # KBR 3.58 MKS from Kyocera America (above address). Infrared photodiode <b>461</b> is the module GPIU52Y available from Sharp Microelectronics, 5700 NW Pacific Rim Boulevard, Camas, Wash. 98607. Transistors <b>464</b> and <b>470</b> are MOS FET, 2N7002 available from Motorola, Inc. (above address).</p>
    <p>FIG. 4E is an illustrative flow chart <b>480</b> for the software running in the microcontroller <b>424</b> of FIG. <b>4</b>D. The software for FIG. 4E is listed in Appendix A and described in detail in the copending application referenced above. The software can be compiled and linked by the Motorola M68HC705KICS (above address).</p>
    <p>As seen from FIG. 4E, USOUT output of microcontroller <b>424</b> follows and inverts SIN input except when RTS goes low in which case an identifying ASCII byte “M” is output on USOUT.</p>
    <p>In accordance with this invention, a user can place a storage media (such as CD-ROM <b>110</b>) into a compatible peripheral of a powered up and booted host device (such as host device <b>120</b>) running an operating system and automatically retrieve selections encoded in the storage media using a remote control without touching any keys or switches of the host device. To facilitate automatic detection of insertion of a storage media, a host device is installed during booting with an autostart driver which periodically polls one or more peripherals of the host device. In an alternative embodiment, the autostart driver is invoked by an interrupt from a removable storage media peripheral caused by insertion of a storage media into the peripheral.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of this invention, all host devices are configured with an autostart driver (described below). The autostart driver is installed during the start up of a host device such as host device <b>120</b> by inserting an instruction to install the autostart driver in “CONFIG.SYS” in a boot disk of host device <b>120</b>. For example, the instruction “DEVICE EQUALS C:\V6.000\AUTOSTRT.SYS” can be inserted in CONFIG.SYS for an IBM PC host device.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of this invention, a host device <b>120</b> executes step by step each instruction illustrated by the flow chart <b>500</b> of FIG. <b>5</b>A. When a user turns on the power to host device <b>120</b>, host device <b>120</b> powers up and performs self test in step <b>501</b>. Then host device <b>120</b> goes via branch <b>502</b> to step <b>503</b> where host device <b>120</b> executes firmware encoded in a ROM on the mother board of host device <b>120</b>. Then host device <b>120</b> goes via branch <b>504</b> to step <b>505</b> where host device <b>120</b> boots the operating system from a storage media, wherein the storage media containing the operating system can be either a removable storage media (such as a floppy disk) or a permanent storage media which is an integral part of host device <b>120</b> (such as a hard drive). During booting, host device <b>120</b> checks for initialization files such as startup files and configuration files. On finding a valid initialization file, host device <b>120</b> uses the initialization file during booting. Then host device <b>120</b> goes via branch <b>506</b> to step <b>507</b> where host device <b>120</b> installs an autostart driver (such as driver <b>436</b>) in main memory (such as memory <b>435</b>). Then host device <b>120</b> goes via branch <b>508</b> to step <b>509</b> where host device <b>120</b> executes the instructions coded in the installed autostart driver.</p>
    <p>Although not shown in FIG. 5A, host device <b>120</b> can execute several instructions unrelated to installing an autostart driver at various points not shown in flow chart <b>500</b> (such as within branch <b>506</b> to install other drivers and within branch <b>508</b> to execute other drivers).</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of this invention, an autostart driver in a host device <b>120</b> detects insertion of a storage media and upon detection of a storage media such as CD-ROM <b>119</b> in a peripheral, seeks a file having a first predetermined name such as, the unique symbol DISGO™. A predetermined name is any name which is determined ahead of time and which is consistently used in the autostart driver and also in compatible storage media. In one embodiment of this invention, files with first and second predetermined names (such as DISGOKEY.EXE and DISGO.BAT) are present in a set of storage medias released by licensees of the owner of this patent. At the very least, a file with second predetermined name (such as DISGO.BAT) must be present on a storage media to be compatible with an autostart driver which seeks a file of the second predetermined name DISGO.BAT in accordance with this invention.</p>
    <p>Every file having the second predetermined name (such as DISGO.BAT <b>430</b> of FIG. 4A) contains a sequence of application start-up instructions to be executed to start an application for using selections encoded in the inserted storage media. In one embodiment of this invention, the file with second predetermined name is executed by a user manually. In another embodiment of this invention, the file with second predetermined name is executed by an autostart driver of a host device.</p>
    <p>Application start-up instructions include for example the instruction to (1) start application either from the inserted storage media or alternatively from a remote server's storage media, (2) access a specified location on the inserted storage media, (3) retrieve and display certain selections contained at a location on the storage media, and/or (4) execute certain application instructions located in memory of the host device or in the storage media.</p>
    <p>Prior to starting an application, the autostart driver can seek to identify a security key to ensure the authenticity of the storage media and then execute the sequence of application start-up instructions once the security key has been correctly identified. For example, the key could be a uniquely identifiable encoding in the inserted storage media of a copyright notice in file of a first predetermined name (driver <b>436</b>) such as, DISGOKEY.EXE.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5B is a flow chart of an autostart driver <b>510</b> running on microcomputer <b>426</b> of a host device <b>420</b> in accordance with this invention. Autostart driver <b>510</b> at first initializes variables in step <b>511</b> and goes via branch <b>512</b> to step <b>513</b>. In step <b>513</b>, autostart driver <b>510</b> enables interrupt from removable storage media peripherals. A removable storage media peripheral is any peripheral of a host device into which a storage media can be removably and repeatedly inserted and with drawn, for example drive A, drive B and a CD drive of an IBM PC host device <b>120</b>.</p>
    <p>Then autostart driver <b>510</b> goes via branch <b>514</b> to step <b>515</b>. In step <b>515</b>, autostart driver <b>510</b> waits for an interrupt from a removable storage media peripheral. Then on receipt of an interrupt, autostart driver <b>510</b> goes via branch <b>516</b> to decision box <b>517</b>. In decision box <b>517</b> autostart driver <b>510</b> checks to see if a file of a first predetermined name DISGOKEY.EXE is accessible from the removable storage media peripheral which caused the interrupt. If DISGOKEY.EXE is not accessible, autostart driver <b>510</b> goes via branches <b>531</b> and <b>532</b> back to step <b>515</b> (described above).</p>
    <p>If DISGOKEY.EXE is accessible in the removable storage media peripheral which caused the interrupt, autostart driver <b>510</b> goes via branch <b>518</b> to step <b>519</b>. In step <b>519</b>, autostart driver <b>510</b> checks to see if a security key is present in a file of a first predetermined name on the storage media. For example, autostart driver <b>510</b> opens the file of first predetermined name, DISGOKEY.EXE and compares the bitmap in DISGOKEY.EXE with a bitmap locally hard coded in autostart driver <b>510</b>. Then autostart driver <b>510</b> goes via branch <b>520</b> to decision box <b>521</b>.</p>
    <p>In decision box <b>521</b> autostart driver <b>510</b> checks if the bitmap in DISGOKEY.EXE was valid. If the bitmap in DISGOKEY.EXE was invalid, autostart driver <b>510</b> goes via branches <b>522</b> and <b>532</b> back to step <b>515</b> (described above). Alternatively if DISGOKEY.EXE bitmap is valid, autostart driver <b>510</b> goes via branch <b>523</b> to decision box <b>524</b>.</p>
    <p>In decision box <b>524</b>, autostart driver <b>510</b> checks to see if a file of a second predetermined name DISGO.BAT is accessible from the removable storage media peripheral which caused the interrupt. If DISGO.BAT is not accessible, autostart driver <b>510</b> goes via branches <b>525</b> and <b>532</b> back to step <b>515</b> (described above). If DISGO.BAT is accessible in the removable storage media peripheral which caused the interrupt, autostart driver <b>510</b> goes via branch <b>526</b> to step <b>527</b>.</p>
    <p>In step <b>527</b> autostart driver <b>510</b> stores the peripheral name in which DISGO.BAT was found and in which DISGOKEY.EXE was found valid into a variable X. For example, autostart driver <b>510</b> can store the drive letter A in variable X if a removable storage media containing DISGO.BAT and a valid DISGOKEY.EXE was inserted in drive A of IBM PC host device <b>120</b>.</p>
    <p>Then autostart driver <b>510</b> disables the interrupt that were enabled in step <b>513</b>. The disabling of interrupts allows autostart driver <b>510</b> to execute an application without being interrupted by user insertion of a removable storage media. Then autostart driver <b>510</b> goes via branch <b>528</b> to step <b>529</b>. In step <b>529</b> autostart driver <b>510</b> executes the command X:DISGO.BAT which executes instructions in DISGO.BAT of the removable storage media inserted by a user into the peripheral of host device <b>120</b>. DISGO.BAT in turn loads into main memory at least a portion of the software of the application encoded on the inserted storage media and then passes control to the application. The application interprets the button codes of the wireless signal transmitted by a user pressing an associated button of a remote control (as described below) in accordance with this invention.</p>
    <p>Once the application has terminated, control returns from the application to step <b>529</b> of autostart driver <b>510</b>. Autostart driver <b>510</b> goes via branch <b>530</b> back to step <b>513</b> (described above) which allows autostart driver <b>510</b> to continue to be responsive to the insertion of a storage media into a peripheral of host device <b>120</b>.</p>
    <p>In another embodiment of this invention, in step <b>529</b>, instead of the autostart driver executing the instructions in DISGO.BAT as shown in FIG. 5B, the autostart driver starts up or spawns a new process which executes the instructions in DISGO.BAT.</p>
    <p>When autostart driver <b>510</b> fails to find a DISGO.BAT or fails to find a DISGOKEY.EXE or if DISGOKEY.EXE bitmap is invalid, autostart driver <b>510</b> returns to step <b>515</b> (as noted above) so that a user can invoke other applications encoded on a removable storage media in the conventional manner, thus bypassing the automatic startup feature provided by autostart driver <b>510</b>.</p>
    <p>In an alternate embodiment of this invention, an autostart driver <b>510</b> skips steps <b>517</b>, <b>519</b> and <b>521</b> in which a security key is checked. In such an embodiment, autostart driver <b>510</b> goes from step <b>515</b> via branch <b>533</b> (shown dotted) to step <b>523</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5C shows an alternative embodiment of an autostart driver <b>540</b> in accordance with this invention. Autostart driver <b>540</b> is similar to autostart driver <b>510</b> except that instead of setting up and waiting on interrupts from removable storage media peripherals, autostart driver <b>540</b> sets up a timer interrupt and waits on the timer interrupt, thereby periodically checking the peripherals of a host device such as host device <b>120</b>.</p>
    <p>Autostart driver <b>540</b> initializes variables in step <b>541</b> and goes via branch <b>542</b> to step <b>543</b>. In step <b>543</b>, autostart driver <b>540</b> sets a timer period to one second. Then autostart driver <b>540</b> goes via branch <b>544</b> to step <b>545</b>. In step <b>545</b> autostart driver <b>540</b> enables the timer interrupt.</p>
    <p>Then autostart driver <b>540</b> goes via branch <b>546</b> to step <b>547</b>. In step <b>547</b> autostart driver <b>540</b> waits for a timer interrupt. Then autostart driver <b>540</b> on receiving an interrupt from the timer (which occurs after one second, the timer period set in step <b>543</b>) autostart driver <b>540</b> goes via branch <b>548</b> to step <b>549</b>. In step <b>549</b>, autostart driver <b>540</b> sets the current peripheral variable to the name of the first removable storage media peripheral in host device <b>120</b>. Then autostart driver <b>540</b> goes via branch <b>550</b> to decision box <b>551</b>. In decision box <b>551</b> autostart driver <b>540</b> checks to see if the file DISGOKEY.EXE is present in the peripheral having the name in the current peripheral variable. If autostart driver <b>540</b> is unsuccessful (either because a storage media is not present in the current peripheral or the file DISGOKEY.EXE is not present in the storage media) then autostart driver <b>540</b> goes via branch <b>552</b> to decision box <b>553</b>.</p>
    <p>In decision box <b>553</b> autostart driver <b>540</b> decides whether all removable storage media peripherals of host device <b>120</b> have been checked during the current timer interrupt. If autostart driver <b>540</b> finds that not all the removable storage media peripherals have been checked, autostart driver <b>540</b> goes via branch <b>554</b> to step <b>555</b>. In step <b>555</b> autostart driver <b>540</b> increments the current peripheral variable by setting the peripheral name of the next removable storage media peripheral to the current peripheral variable. Then autostart driver <b>540</b> goes via branch <b>556</b> and <b>550</b> back to decision box <b>551</b> (described above). If all of the removable storage media peripherals have been checked in decision box <b>553</b>, then autostart driver <b>540</b> goes via branch <b>571</b> to step <b>547</b>.</p>
    <p>If DISGOKEY.EXE was found by autostart driver <b>540</b> in decision box <b>551</b>, autostart driver <b>540</b> goes via branch <b>557</b> to step <b>558</b>. Step <b>558</b>, branch <b>559</b> and decision box <b>560</b> are similar to step <b>519</b>, branch <b>520</b> and decision box <b>521</b> (described above in reference to FIG. <b>5</b>B). If autostart driver <b>540</b> is unsuccessful in decision box <b>560</b>, autostart driver <b>540</b> goes via branch <b>561</b> to decision box <b>553</b> (described above). If autostart driver <b>540</b> is successful in decision box <b>560</b>, autostart driver <b>540</b> goes via branch <b>562</b> to decision box <b>563</b>. In decision box <b>563</b>, autostart driver <b>540</b> checks if DISGO.BAT is present in the current peripheral. If autostart driver is unsuccessful in decision box <b>563</b>, autostart driver <b>540</b> goes via branch <b>564</b> to decision box <b>553</b> else autostart driver <b>540</b> goes to step <b>566</b> via branch <b>565</b>.</p>
    <p>In step <b>566</b> autostart driver <b>540</b> stores the name of the peripheral in which DISGO.BAT was found in variable X and disables the timer interrupt enabled in step <b>535</b>. Then autostart driver <b>540</b> goes via branch <b>567</b> to step <b>568</b> which is similar to step <b>529</b> (FIG. <b>5</b>B). Once the application has completed, and control has returned to autostart driver <b>540</b>, autostart driver <b>540</b> goes via branch <b>569</b> to step <b>545</b> described above.</p>
    <p>In an alternative embodiment of autostart driver <b>540</b>, decision box <b>551</b>, step <b>558</b> and decision box <b>560</b> are skipped by using branch <b>570</b> (shown dotted) to go from step <b>549</b> to step <b>563</b>.</p>
    <p>Although in FIGS. 5A, <b>5</b>B and <b>5</b>C, the host device is shown being configured with an autostart driver which is a separate executable image, the instructions to a host device shown in FIG. 5A, <b>5</b>B and <b>5</b>C can be issued in other forms suitable for the host device (such as commands to the operating system).</p>
    <p>Although in one embodiment of this invention, the autostart driver includes instructions executed by a central processing unit, in an alternative embodiment, the host device includes a first hardwired logic which detects insertion of a storage media into a peripheral. A second hardwired logic checks the inserted storage media for a file of a first predetermined name and compares a bitmap in the file with a bitmap stored in a read only memory. In another embodiment, there is a third hardwired logic which checks for a file of a second predetermined name. In one specific embodiment of this invention, the first, second and third hardwired logics are all included in the peripherals hardware and generate an autostart interrupt to the central processing unit on a successful result. On receipt of the autostart interrupt, the central processing unit executes the file of the second predetermined name from the peripheral which generated the autostart interrupt.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5D shows the contents of the file with second predetermined name DISGO.BAT <b>430</b> which is invoked in step <b>524</b> by autostart driver <b>510</b> and in step <b>563</b> by autostart driver <b>540</b>. DISGO.BAT <b>430</b> contains the operating system command <b>574</b> which reads “X:”. Operating system command <b>574</b> changes the current default drive to the drive in which a storage media has been inserted. The next command in DISGO.BAT <b>430</b> is operating system command <b>575</b> which reads “\busweek”. Operating system command <b>575</b> initiates the running of an application encoded as BUSWEEK.EXE <b>431</b> (FIG. <b>4</b>A).</p>
    <p>While in one specific embodiment of this invention, the application is encoded as BUSWEEK.EXE <b>431</b>, other file names (such as FIREBOOK.EXE) can be used for an application so long as the same name is consistently used in operating system command <b>563</b> in file with second predetermined name DISGO.BAT <b>430</b> (which contains the application startup instructions which start the application for using selections on the inserted storage media).</p>
    <p>Therefore when an autostart driver is installed in a host device, this invention allows applications encoded in compatible storage media (as described above) to start up automatically without any additional user input, soon after a storage media is inserted into a peripheral of the host device. Therefore once a host device is powered up, booted and installed with an autostart driver, a user need not touch any keys or switches of a host device, and can merely insert a storage media to start an application in accordance with this invention.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5D also illustrates a copyright notice <b>564</b> which is used as a security key bitmap and which is compared with an identical copyright notice bitmap locally hard coded in autostart drivers <b>510</b> and <b>530</b>.</p>
    <p>One advantage of the autostart driver of this invention is that the user need not have any computer knowledge to start an application. Pre-school children can now enjoy interactive media without even toggling a power switch (for example, merely inserting a storage media into a host device). Although an autostart driver is used to start an application for a remote control in one embodiment of this invention, an autostart driver can also automatically start other applications such as LOTUS 1-2-3™ and Word Perfect™ if so programmed.</p>
    <p>An application for displaying selections encoded on a storage media is a simple software program which stores and manipulates many types of data including: graphics files for the pictures, text files for the captions, sound files for captions (for a picture interactive book) and video recording files.</p>
    <p>One embodiment of a remote control intended for educative interactive media includes associated electronic content of drawings and voice recordings of words, numbers and/or facts. The selections of words, numbers and/or facts, drawings and voice recordings are organized by category (such as a category of “FISH” selections and another category of and “BIRDS” selections) and each category is accessed by a different button.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5E illustrates a flow chart for one embodiment of an application <b>570</b> for use with a remote control entitled “Teach Your Baby to Read” which has associated electronic content containing twenty categories, each category containing 200 selections, each selection containing a picture, text, video recording and voice recording. when a storage media containing the associated electronic content is inserted, application <b>576</b> initializes in step <b>577</b> and displays the title screen of the interactive media in step <b>578</b>. Application <b>576</b> then waits for a button code from the remote control in step <b>579</b>. On receiving an appropriate button code, in step <b>580</b> application <b>576</b> randomly picks one of the 20 categories as the current category. Next in step <b>581</b>, the application randomly picks one of 200 selections of words from the current category.</p>
    <p>Next in step <b>582</b>, application <b>526</b> displays the associated video recording from the current selection. Next in step <b>583</b>, application <b>576</b> display the picture from the current selection and waits for one second. In step <b>584</b> application <b>576</b> displays the associated text from the current selection. Then in step <b>585</b>, application <b>576</b> displays the associated voice recording from the current selection. In step <b>586</b>, application <b>576</b> increases the selection count and compares the selection count with 10 to see if ten selections have been displayed. If ten selections have not been displayed, application <b>576</b> takes branch <b>587</b> and returns to step <b>581</b>. If the word count indicates that ten selections have been displayed, application <b>576</b> goes from step <b>586</b> via branch <b>588</b> to step <b>578</b>.</p>
    <p>In an alternative embodiment the application is driven by an interrupt caused by receipt of a button code instead of a wait for one second (in step <b>583</b>) prior to displaying the voice recording.</p>
    <p>An application similar to application <b>576</b> is used with a picture book remote control. Instead of randomly selecting and displaying a word, the picture book application sequentially displays the cover page, then the first selection and then the second selection and so on, until all selections are displayed and then the back cover is displayed, after which the front cover is again displayed. Such an application implements the functions indicated by the buttons on the remote control, such as “NEXT”, “PREVIOUS”, “BEGIN” and “END” (shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B on a different remote control).</p>
    <p>FIGS. 5F, <b>5</b>G and <b>5</b>H illustrate the electronic content which can be used with an application <b>576</b> shown in FIG. <b>5</b>E. As shown in FIG. 5F, electronic content <b>590</b> includes fish category <b>591</b>, birds category <b>592</b> and flowers category <b>593</b>. As shown in FIG. 5G, birds category <b>592</b> includes a parrot selection <b>595</b>, pigeon selection <b>596</b> and blue jay selection <b>597</b>. As shown in FIG. 5H, a blue jay selection <b>597</b> includes a picture file <b>597</b>A, text file <b>597</b>B, video recording file <b>597</b>C and voice recording file <b>597</b>D.</p>
    <p>Application <b>576</b> can be used with electronic content <b>590</b> wherein birds category <b>592</b> is randomly selected from the various categories in step <b>580</b>. Then in step <b>581</b>, a blue jay selection <b>597</b> is randomly selected from category <b>592</b>. Then in step <b>582</b> video recording <b>597</b>C is retrieved from a storage media containing electronic content <b>590</b> and displayed to the user on a display device (suitable for displaying a video recording). Then in step <b>583</b> application <b>576</b> displays picture <b>597</b>A from selection <b>597</b> on the display device. Then in step <b>584</b> application <b>576</b> displays text <b>597</b>B from selection <b>597</b> on the display device. Next in step <b>585</b> application <b>576</b> displays a voice recording <b>597</b>D from selection <b>597</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 6A illustrates a storage media remote control <b>600</b> in accordance with this invention. Such a storage media remote control <b>600</b> includes a local storage media <b>603</b> and a storage media housing <b>601</b>. In FIG. 6A, local storage media <b>603</b> is shown highlighted (double circle) to indicate that the storage media is an essential feature included in remote control <b>600</b>.

    <p>In the specific embodiment of periodical remote control <b>640</b> shown in FIG. 6H, each selection is identified by text and graphic content in the form of a title, a summary and a photograph. For example, a first selection is identified by title <b>646</b>A<b>1</b>, summary <b>646</b>A<b>2</b>, and photograph <b>646</b>A<b>3</b>. A second article selection is identified by title <b>646</b>B<b>1</b>, summary <b>646</b>B<b>2</b> and photograph <b>646</b>B<b>3</b>.</p>
    <p>The inner side <b>642</b>B of back cover <b>642</b> also identifies additional selections such as a third article selection with title <b>646</b>C<b>1</b>, summary <b>646</b>C<b>2</b> and photograph <b>646</b>C<b>3</b>. Three other selections with titles <b>646</b>D<b>1</b>, <b>646</b>E<b>1</b> and <b>646</b>F<b>1</b>, with summaries <b>646</b>D<b>2</b>, <b>646</b>E<b>2</b> and <b>646</b>F<b>2</b>, and photographs <b>646</b>D<b>3</b>, <b>646</b>E<b>3</b>, and <b>646</b>F<b>3</b> are also identified on back cover <b>642</b>.</p>
    <p>In another embodiment, periodical remote control <b>640</b> is a catalog of products with each selection including a video recording of the product, the title (such as title <b>646</b>C<b>1</b>) being the product's name, the summary (such as summary <b>646</b>C<b>2</b>) being a product description and the photograph (such as photograph <b>646</b>C<b>3</b>) being a photograph of the product.</p>
    <p>In accordance with this invention, physical attachments <b>14</b>A, <b>604</b>A and <b>674</b>A can be implemented by the adhesion of printed ink to the surface of a button and visual associations <b>14</b>B, <b>604</b>B and <b>674</b>B implemented by the location of the printed content directly on the button surface.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of this invention, each of the text and/or graphic content is printed on the surface of a button capable of causing a wireless signal to be transmitted by remote control <b>640</b>. For example, title <b>646</b>A<b>1</b>, summary <b>646</b>A<b>2</b> and photograph <b>646</b>A<b>3</b> are each printed on a button surface different from each other. In one embodiment, each of the buttons identifying a given selection cause the same button code to be transmitted. In another embodiment, each of the buttons identifying a given selection are all printed on a single button surface.</p>
    <p>In one specific embodiment of this invention, the buttons of a periodical remote control are membrane buttons available from EECO Membrane Switch Operations, 2949 N. 31st Ave., Phoenix, Ariz. 85017. Front cover <b>641</b> and back cover <b>642</b> include a heat stabilized polyester membrane on which text and photographs are screen printed, an upper circuit of heat stabilized polyester on which conductive inks are screen printed, a spacer die cut layer of dielectric, a lower circuit layer of heat stabilized polyester on which conductive inks are screen printed, an adhesive layer and a bottom mounting layer. Such a periodical remote control can be made using membrane switches as described in “Designer's Specification Guide” available from EECO Membrane Switch Operations, 2949 North 31st Avenue, Phoenix, Ariz. 85017, which is incorporated herein in its entirety.</p>
    <p>In an alternative embodiment, front cover inner side <b>641</b>B and back cover inner side <b>642</b>B are touch panels which when touched cause a wireless signal to be transmitted (as described below in reference to FIGS. 7D, <b>7</b>E, <b>7</b>F, <b>7</b>G and <b>7</b>H).</p>
    <p>Back cover inner side <b>642</b>B has an array of buttons <b>643</b>, which can be alphanumeric buttons arranged in a manner similar to conventional PC keyboards or a conventional telephone keypad. Back cover inner side <b>642</b>B also has other buttons such as arrows <b>644</b>A, <b>644</b>B, <b>644</b>C and <b>644</b>D which permit a user to remotely move a cursor on monitor <b>122</b> (FIG. <b>1</b>E). Also provided on back cover innerside <b>642</b>B are special function buttons: SELECT button <b>645</b>A, SKIP button <b>645</b>B, REPEAT button <b>645</b>C and INFO button <b>645</b>D.</p>
    <p>Back cover innerside <b>642</b>B supports a remote control circuitry <b>648</b> which includes infrared LED <b>648</b>A (covered by a surface transparent to infrared light), a microcontroller <b>648</b>B and batteries <b>648</b>C and <b>648</b>D, all connected in the manner described below (in reference to FIG. <b>7</b>A). In one embodiment of this invention, the periodical remote control is paper thin and is flexible (using a flexboard instead of a printed circuit board).</p>
    <p>Therefore, the buttons for a periodical remote control are simply regions on the Table of Contents printed on the front and back covers of a remote control. To use periodical remote control <b>640</b>, the user removes storage media <b>649</b> from a holder built into front cover <b>640</b> and inserts storage media <b>649</b> into a host device such as host device <b>120</b> (FIG. <b>1</b>E). In another embodiment of a periodical remote control, there is no storage media and holder, and the host device access associated electronic content from a remote server (FIG. <b>1</b>E).</p>
    <p>In one specific embodiment, a Business Week remote control has a CD storage media. The host is a 3DO game platform with a video CD player available from Panasonic Company of America, 6550 Katella Ave., Cypress, Calif. 90630. To use the Business Week remote control, the user inserts the CD into the video CD player of the 3DO game platform (which has been booted and installed with an autostart driver).</p>
    <p>As soon as a storage media of a periodical remote control is inserted into a peripheral of a host device <b>150</b> (FIG. <b>1</b>F), monitor <b>141</b> displays a 30 second preview of major selections available in the inserted storage media. Thereafter, the application in host device <b>150</b> displays a continuous commercial break which involves randomly selecting and displaying forever, one of 40 commercials encoded in the inserted storage media. Each commercial has a format identical to a television commercial.</p>
    <p>The continuous commercial break continues until the user selects an article by pressing one of the article selecting buttons in the Table of Contents of the periodical remote control. For example, to display a selection described in title <b>646</b>A<b>1</b>, summary <b>646</b>A<b>2</b> and photograph <b>646</b>A<b>3</b>, a user merely touches any one of touch sensitive regions <b>646</b>A<b>1</b>, <b>646</b>A<b>2</b> or <b>646</b>A<b>3</b>.</p>
    <p>When any one of the touch sensitive regions is touched, periodical remote control <b>640</b> sends a wireless signal to host device <b>120</b>. An application in host device <b>120</b> retrieves from storage media <b>649</b> an article preview selection which is a 30-second preview of the article indicated by the touched region and displays the retrieved results. Double touching of a touch sensitive region retrieves the article selection rather than the article preview selection. An article selection can include an hour long real TV program which is displayed on monitor <b>122</b>. During display of an article selection in one embodiment, a commercial selection is randomly retrieved and displayed every few minutes, interrupting the display of the article selection.</p>
    <p>While a selection is being displayed, touching a SKIP button <b>645</b>B causes periodical remote control <b>640</b> to send a wireless signal which causes the host device application to skip the selection currently being displayed and jump to a continuous commercial break (where random commercials are automatically played until another article selection is indicated by the user). If SKIP button <b>645</b>B is pressed during a commercial interruption of an article selection display, the interrupted article selection display is resumed.</p>
    <p>If SKIP button <b>645</b>B is pressed during a continuous commercial break, the currently playing commercial is interrupted (skipped) and another randomly selected commercial is started immediately.</p>
    <p>If REPEAT button <b>645</b>C is pressed during a continuous commercial break, the commercial selection currently being displayed is interrupted and the commercial displayed immediately previous to the current commercial is displayed.</p>
    <p>Pressing INFO button <b>645</b>D starts a DETAIL mode program that opens up a dialog box (not shown) on monitor <b>141</b> which allows the user to interactively access more detailed information about the product being advertised. For example, in one embodiment the user is presented with a form to be filled out to create a purchase order of the product being advertised. Once the user fills out the form, host device <b>120</b> automatically communicates with the advertiser via modem <b>144</b>A and phone line <b>145</b>A. In another embodiment of this invention, the DETAIL mode dialog box permits access to a complete index of advertisers from which the user can interactively choose a desired commercial selection to be displayed.</p>
    <p>Pressing INFO button <b>645</b>D during display of an article selection opens a DETAIL mode dialog box which provides detailed information about the article selection being currently displayed.</p>
    <p>Pressing REPEAT button <b>645</b>C during display of a commercial selection results in the commercial selection previously displayed to be re-displayed immediately. REPEAT button <b>645</b>C can be pressed multiple times to sequentially go backwards to any commercial selection previously displayed (up to 255 commercials with wrap-around).</p>
    <p>A special preview selection provides a preview of all the article selections encoded in storage media <b>648</b>. The preview selection has a normal television commercial selection format (similar to a 30 second synopsis of the television show “60 minutes”).</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of this invention, a periodical remote control includes a front cover, a back cover and printed pages between the front cover and back cover. The printed pages are identical to the pages between the covers of the conventional printed version of a magazine. Some of the printed pages are normal printed pages while other printed pages are touch sensitive pages. The printed pages containing the Table of Contents are touch sensitive (as described above).</p>
    <p>Although periodical remote control <b>640</b> has been described above as having a removable storage media <b>648</b> another periodical remote control in accordance with this invention has all of the features of periodical remote control <b>640</b> except for storage media <b>649</b> and the corresponding holder.</p>
    <p>FIG. 6I illustrates an alternative embodiment of a storage media remote control <b>636</b> in the form of a multi-page book having a front cover <b>637</b>, a page <b>638</b> and a back cover <b>639</b>. On front cover <b>637</b> are mounted a CD ROM <b>637</b>A and buttons <b>637</b>B, <b>637</b>C and <b>637</b>D. Page <b>638</b> has buttons <b>638</b>A, <b>638</b>B, <b>638</b>C and <b>638</b>D. On back cover <b>639</b> are mounted buttons <b>639</b>A and <b>639</b>B and remote control circuitry <b>639</b>C (which includes components such as, a microcontroller and an infrared LED). Although only one page <b>638</b> is shown in FIG. 6J, multi-page remote control <b>636</b> can have any number of pages in accordance with this invention.</p>
    <p>FIG. 6J shows one embodiment of a storage media remote control <b>660</b> in accordance with this invention. Storage media remote control <b>660</b> is in the form of a CD box with a front cover <b>661</b>, a spine <b>662</b> and a back cover <b>663</b>. Mounted on spine <b>662</b> is an LED <b>662</b>A, a microcontroller <b>662</b>B and a battery <b>662</b>C. Mounted on the inside of front cover <b>661</b> are membrane buttons <b>664</b>A, <b>664</b>B, <b>664</b>C, and <b>664</b>D corresponding to “I WANT TO HOLD YOUR HAND” song name <b>665</b>A, “HARD DAYS NIGHT” song name <b>665</b>B, “REVOLUTION” song name <b>665</b>C and “WHEN I AM SIXTY-FOUR” song name <b>665</b>D of music video selections encoded in CD <b>663</b>A. CD <b>663</b>A is removably mounted on the inside of back cover <b>663</b>.</p>
    <p>To enjoy to a music video selection encoded in CD <b>663</b>A, a user removes CD <b>663</b>A from remote control <b>660</b> and inserts CD <b>663</b>A in a suitable peripheral of a host device, such as CD drive <b>121</b> of host device <b>120</b>. On touching one of membrane buttons <b>664</b>A, <b>664</b>B, <b>664</b>C, and <b>664</b>D a microcontroller <b>632</b>B sends a selection identifying button code via LED <b>632</b>A to an application running in host device <b>120</b> to identify the desired selection. The application on host device <b>120</b> retrieves the desired music video selection and displays the results through speaker <b>124</b> and/or monitor <b>122</b>. A similar format can be used for an audio only CD in accordance with this invention. One advantage of a storage media remote control is that the normal channels of sales, such as a CD music store a book store and a newspaper stand can be used to sell such storage media remote controls.</p>
    <p>In alternative embodiments of this invention a remote control can include a CD containing a catalog, a dictionary or an encyclopedia. An application which displays specific information sought by the user when the user presses one or more buttons on the remote control can be distributed on the storage media of the remote control in addition to article selections. Once such an application is running on the host device, touching a button on the remote control causes the desired selection encoded in the CD to be retrieved and displayed on a monitor of the host device.</p>
    <p>FIG. 6K illustrates a data button remote control <b>670</b> in accordance with this invention. Data button remote control <b>670</b> includes a housing <b>671</b> having data selecting content (text/graphic), one or more data button(s) <b>672</b> and data specific associated electronic content <b>673</b>. Housing <b>671</b> can be a housing of any arbitrary shape or size and includes but is not limited to storage media housings and printed publications. In FIG. 6K, data button(s) <b>672</b> are shown highlighted (double circle) to indicate the data button feature included in remote control <b>670</b>.</p>
    <p>Data button(s) <b>672</b> have a physical attachment <b>674</b>A to housing <b>671</b>. Also, data button(s) <b>672</b> have a visual association <b>674</b>B with the data selecting content of housing <b>671</b>. Data button(s) <b>672</b> have remote electronic association <b>675</b> with associated electronic content <b>673</b>.</p>
    <p>Data specific associated electronic content <b>673</b> has data selecting (descriptive/derivative) association <b>676</b> with housing <b>671</b>. Data specific associated electronic content <b>673</b> can be encoded in a local storage media or a remote storage media accessible via a remote server.</p>
    <p>Any data button remote control <b>670</b> in accordance with this invention is not limited to having only data buttons and can also include other features such as function selecting text/graphic content and corresponding function buttons.</p>
    <p>One advantage of a data button remote control is that the user need not read instructions in a manual. Also the user need not remember the syntax and semantics of commands to be typed to retrieve a desired selection. Moreover the user need not remember the names of the selections. By simply touching a button visually associated with a data selecting content, the user can get instantaneous access to the desired selection. Therefore a data button remote control is simple and utilizes the user's intuition rather than knowledge of commands and file names of selections usually given in an instruction manual. A data button remote control also makes interactive media easier to create, market and use (as discussed below).</p>
    <p>The above described storage media remote control <b>660</b> is an embodiment of a data button remote control because buttons <b>664</b>A, <b>664</b>B, <b>664</b>C and <b>664</b>D are data buttons each of which has a remote electronic association with a music video recording selection encoded on CD <b>663</b>A.</p>
    <p>Periodical remote control <b>640</b> is also a data button remote control because buttons such as <b>646</b>A<b>1</b>, <b>646</b>A<b>2</b>, <b>646</b>A<b>3</b>, <b>646</b>B<b>1</b>, <b>646</b>B<b>2</b>, <b>646</b>B<b>3</b>, <b>646</b>C<b>1</b>, <b>646</b>C<b>2</b> and <b>646</b>C<b>3</b> are data buttons, each of which has a remote electronic association with an article selection (data) encoded on CD-ROM <b>648</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 6L illustrates a globe remote control <b>680</b> which is another embodiment of a data button remote control <b>670</b>. Globe remote control <b>680</b> includes a housing <b>681</b> which has imprinted on it data selecting graphic content <b>682</b>A, <b>682</b>B, <b>682</b>C and <b>682</b>D. Housing <b>681</b> is a spherical globe showing the various continents of the planet earth. Data selecting graphic content <b>682</b>A is illustrative of the South American continent. Data selecting graphic content <b>682</b>B is illustrative of the North American continent. Data selecting graphic content <b>682</b>C is illustrative of the African continent. Data selecting graphic content <b>682</b>D is illustrative of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
    <p>Globe remote control <b>680</b> also includes data buttons <b>683</b>A, <b>683</b>B, <b>683</b>C and <b>683</b>D which are membrane buttons connected to remote control circuitry (not shown in FIG. <b>6</b>L). Each of data buttons <b>683</b>A, <b>683</b>B, <b>683</b>C and <b>683</b>D is physically attached to one of data selecting graphic contents <b>682</b>A, <b>682</b>B, <b>682</b>C and <b>682</b>D of housing <b>681</b>. Each of data selecting graphic contents <b>682</b>A, <b>682</b>B, <b>682</b>C, and <b>682</b>D has a visual association with data buttons <b>683</b>A, <b>683</b>B, <b>683</b>C, and <b>683</b>D respectively because each data button is located on the graphic content associated with the data button.</p>
    <p>Pressing one of data button <b>683</b>A, <b>683</b>B, <b>683</b>C, and <b>683</b>D results in remote control <b>680</b> transmitting an associated button code to a host device such as host device <b>120</b>. An application in host device <b>120</b> retrieves associated electronic content which is representative of the graphic content associated with the pressed button. For example, if a button <b>683</b>B is pressed, a selection (such as a video recording) of the North American continent is retrieved by host device <b>120</b> from a local or remote storage media and the results are displayed on a monitor. In one specific embodiment of this invention, remote control <b>680</b> includes a storage media holder <b>684</b> encased within spherical housing <b>681</b> for holding a local storage media.</p>
    <p>FIG. 6M illustrates electronic content <b>685</b> associated with globe remote control <b>680</b>. Associated electronic content <b>685</b> can be encoded in a local or remote storage media accessible to a host device.

    <p>A block diagram of the components of multi-button remote control in accordance with this invention is similar to the block diagram shown in FIG. <b>4</b>A and which has been described above.</p>
    <p>FIG. 7A is a plan view of a four button printed circuit board (PCB) <b>700</b> for use in a four button remote control such as remote controls <b>200</b>, <b>610</b>, <b>615</b>, <b>617</b> and <b>636</b> described above. PCB <b>700</b> is similar to PCB <b>303</b> shown in FIG. <b>3</b>C. except that instead of being enclosed inside a button, PCB <b>700</b> has a rubber key pad <b>701</b> with buttons <b>701</b>A, <b>701</b>B, <b>701</b>C, and <b>701</b>D. Also provided on PCB <b>700</b> are an infrared LED <b>703</b>, a microcontroller <b>705</b> and watch batteries <b>702</b>A and <b>702</b>B connected to buttons <b>701</b>A, <b>701</b>B, <b>701</b>C and <b>701</b>D.</p>
    <p>FIG. 7B is an illustrative circuit diagram for one embodiment of a multi button remote control. The circuit diagram in FIG. 7B is similar to the circuit diagram in FIG. 4B described above. Instead of a single button <b>402</b> of FIG. 4B, 24 buttons can be connected by the circuit of FIG. 7B. A matrix of buttons <b>711</b> as well as buttons <b>712</b>A, <b>712</b>B, <b>712</b>C, <b>712</b>D, <b>713</b>A, <b>713</b>B, <b>713</b>C, and <b>713</b>D are each connected to two pins of microcontroller <b>404</b>. For example, button <b>712</b>A is connected to pins <b>404</b>E_<b>1</b> and <b>404</b>I_<b>1</b> and button <b>712</b>B is connected to pins <b>404</b>E_<b>2</b> and <b>404</b>I_<b>2</b>. Microcontroller <b>404</b> pulses transistor <b>442</b> with a specific button code signal when a button (such as button <b>712</b>C) is depressed to short two pins (such as pins <b>404</b>E_<b>1</b> and <b>404</b>I_<b>3</b>). Transistor <b>442</b> in turn causes infrared LED <b>443</b> to transmit an encoded infrared signal <b>407</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 7C is an illustrative flow chart of the software running in microcontroller <b>404</b> of FIG. <b>7</b>B. Software for implementing the flow chart of FIG. 7B is listed in Appendix A. The software can be compiled and linked by Motorola M68HC705KICS. Microcontroller <b>404</b> starts at step <b>721</b> and goes via branch <b>722</b> to step <b>723</b>. In step <b>723</b> microcontroller <b>404</b> initializes variables. Then microcontroller <b>404</b> goes via branch <b>724</b> to step <b>725</b>. In step <b>725</b> microcontroller <b>404</b> goes to SLEEP mode and wakes up when it receives an interrupt when a button is pressed.</p>
    <p>On waking from SLEEP mode, microcontroller <b>404</b> goes via branch <b>729</b> to step <b>730</b>. In step <b>730</b> microcontroller <b>404</b> determines the identity of the pressed button by checking every combination of two pins to find the pins that are shorted to each other (Appendix A).</p>
    <p>For example, microcontroller <b>404</b> determines that button <b>712</b>D is depressed applying a high signal (logic 1) to EB pin <b>404</b>E_<b>1</b> and checking whether SOUT/CD/FB<b>2</b>/C<b>4</b> pin <b>4040</b> is high (logic 1). Microcontroller <b>404</b> is triggered from a sleep state by setting pins <b>404</b>E_<b>1</b>, <b>404</b>E_<b>2</b>, <b>404</b>E_<b>4</b>, <b>404</b>E_<b>5</b>, <b>404</b>E_<b>6</b> and <b>404</b>I_<b>7</b> to high and by tying pins <b>404</b>I_<b>1</b>, <b>404</b>I_<b>2</b>, <b>404</b>I_<b>3</b> and <b>404</b>O to a button interrupt. Then microcontroller <b>404</b> goes from step <b>730</b> via branch <b>731</b> to step <b>732</b>. In step <b>732</b> microcontroller <b>404</b> sends a button code via infrared LED <b>443</b> only once and then goes via branch <b>733</b> and branch <b>724</b> back to step <b>725</b>.</p>
    <p>A multi-button remote control (such as remote control <b>640</b>) can be used with a host device having a receiver (illustrated in FIG. 4D) and which uses the software illustrated in FIG. 4E in a microcontroller. Furthermore, an autostart driver (such as autostart driver <b>500</b>A described above) can be used to automatically start the application for using a multi-button remote control.</p>
    <p>FIG. 7D illustrates a touch panel <b>740</b> which can form buttons on front cover innerside <b>641</b>B and back cover innerside <b>642</b>B of the remote control <b>640</b> of FIGS. 6E, <b>6</b>F and <b>6</b>G. Touch panel <b>740</b> is similar to conventional computer touch screens and includes two sheets <b>741</b> and <b>742</b> attached to each other. In one embodiment of a remote control including touch panel <b>740</b>, the buttons and housing have a physical attachment (such as physical attachments <b>14</b>A, <b>604</b>A and <b>674</b>A of FIGS. 1A, <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>K respectively) formed by printing, engraving, or otherwise attaching the housing content directly to sheet <b>741</b> and/or sheet <b>742</b>.</p>
    <p>Sheet <b>741</b> includes a clear mylar sheet <b>741</b>A with a conductive coating of indium tin oxide <b>741</b>B. Similarly sheet <b>742</b> includes a clear mylar sheet <b>742</b>A with a conductive coating of indium tin oxide <b>742</b>B. Sheets <b>741</b> and <b>742</b> are separated and electrically insulated from each other by small nipples such as nipples <b>743</b>A, <b>743</b>B, <b>743</b>C, <b>743</b>D, and <b>743</b>E which are molded in sheet <b>742</b>.</p>
    <p>Sheet <b>741</b> has a first terminal <b>741</b>C and a second terminal <b>741</b>D at two opposite edges (FIG. <b>7</b>E). A resistance <b>741</b>R is formed by the indium tin oxide between the first terminal <b>741</b>C and the second terminal <b>741</b>D of sheet <b>741</b>. Similarly sheet <b>742</b> has a first terminal <b>742</b>C and a second terminal <b>742</b>D (FIG. 7F) formed at the edges of sheet <b>742</b> such that a resistance <b>742</b>R is formed between terminals <b>742</b>C and <b>742</b>D. When sheets <b>741</b> and <b>742</b> are assembled together to form touch panel <b>740</b>, any object such as a human fingertip touching touch panel <b>740</b> results in sheet <b>741</b> making contact with sheet <b>742</b> at the point of the touch, such as point <b>744</b> in FIG. <b>7</b>G.</p>
    <p>The coordinates of point <b>744</b> in the coordinate system <b>745</b> are determined by the following method: connect terminal <b>742</b>C to VCC (or logic 1) and terminal <b>742</b>D to ground and measure the voltage on terminal <b>741</b>D to determine the X coordinate. Next connect terminals <b>741</b> and <b>741</b>D to VCC and ground respectively and measure the voltage on terminal <b>742</b>C (or <b>742</b>D) to determine the Y coordinate. The measured voltage provides the location of the X coordinate or the Y coordinate because the measured voltage varies depending on the location of the point of touch. A contact between sheet <b>741</b> and <b>742</b> effectively results in a voltage divider as shown in FIG. 7G for the X axis.</p>
    <p>The number of buttons formed from touch panel <b>740</b> are limited only by the resolution of the voltmeter used to measure the voltage. In one embodiment of this invention as described below in reference to FIG. 7H, up to 255 positions can be determined individually in each of X and Y directions resulting in a total of 65,536 possible buttons. Furthermore, in accordance with this invention, an arbitrarily shaped button can be formed by associating the points which fall within the button's shape with the same button code of the button.</p>
    <p>FIG. 7H illustrates one embodiment of a remote control circuit <b>750</b> for a remote control using the touch panel of FIGS. 7D-7G. Remote control circuit <b>750</b> includes touch panel <b>740</b> with terminals <b>741</b>C and <b>742</b>C connected via resistors <b>751</b>B and <b>751</b>A to EY input pin <b>753</b>B and EX input pin <b>753</b>A respectively of microcontroller <b>753</b>. Terminals <b>741</b>D and <b>742</b>D are connected to X input pin <b>753</b>D and Y/WAKE pin <b>753</b>C of microcontroller <b>753</b>. Terminals <b>741</b>D and <b>742</b>D are also connected via capacitors <b>751</b>D and <b>751</b>C to the negative terminal of battery <b>758</b>. Remote control circuit <b>750</b> also has a resonator <b>752</b> connected between X<b>1</b> input pin <b>753</b>E and X<b>2</b> input <b>753</b>F.</p>
    <p>Microcontroller <b>753</b> has a VSS pin <b>753</b>G connected to the negative terminal of battery <b>758</b>. Microcontroller <b>753</b> has a RES pin <b>753</b>J and a VB pin <b>753</b>I connected to the positive terminal of battery <b>758</b>.</p>
    <p>Microcontroller <b>753</b> has an SOUT pin <b>753</b>H connected to the base of transistor <b>756</b>. The collector of transistor <b>756</b> is connected to the cathode of diode <b>755</b>. The anode of diode <b>755</b> is connected via a resistor <b>754</b> to the positive terminal of battery <b>758</b>. The emitter of transistor <b>756</b> is connected to the negative terminal of battery <b>758</b>. Battery <b>758</b> has a capacitor <b>757</b> connected across its positive and negative terminals.</p>

    <p>In one embodiment of this invention, remote control circuit <b>750</b> includes a touch panel available from GM Name Plate, 2095 O'toole Avenue, San Jose, Calif. 95131, (408) 435-1666.</p>
    <p>During operation, remote control circuit <b>750</b> is normally in a low power SLEEP mode with EX input pin <b>753</b>A and Y/WAKE pin <b>753</b>C pull down enabled and positive edge trigger interrupt enabled. EY pin <b>753</b>B and X pin <b>753</b>D are set to output high (logic 1).</p>
    <p>When panel <b>740</b> is touched, an electrical connection is made between terminals <b>741</b>C and <b>741</b>D on top sheet <b>741</b> and terminal <b>742</b>D on bottom sheet <b>742</b>. Therefore touching causes terminal <b>742</b>D to be pulled up which generates a wake up interrupt to microcontroller <b>753</b>.</p>
    <p>When microcontroller <b>753</b> wakes up, the X and Y coordinates of the point being touched are determined as follows. The Y axis coordinate of the touched point is determined in two steps. First the Y axis capacitor <b>751</b>C is charged to a voltage V<sub>y </sub>set by a voltage divider formed by connecting terminals <b>741</b>C and <b>741</b>D to power and ground respectively. Resistor <b>751</b>B limits the voltage V<sub>y </sub>to VCC/3.</p>
    <p>During this first Y axis step, pins <b>753</b>A, <b>753</b>B, <b>753</b>C and <b>753</b>D have the following values: X pin <b>753</b>D is at logic 1, EY pin <b>753</b>B is at logic 0, Y/WAKE pin <b>753</b>C is an input and EX pin <b>753</b>A is an input. The values for each of the steps are listed in TABLE 2 (I denotes high impedance input):</p>

    <p>During the second Y axis step, capacitor <b>751</b>C discharges through the resistor formed by touch panel <b>740</b> between terminals <b>742</b>D and <b>742</b>C. During the discharge of capacitor <b>751</b>C, microprocessor <b>753</b> measures the duration of time (for example 500 microseconds) for capacitor <b>751</b>C to go from voltage V<sub>y </sub>(for example 2.5 volts) to the logic threshold voltage of Y/WAKE pin <b>753</b>C (logic 1, for example 1.5 volts).</p>
    <p>The X coordinate is also measured in two steps in a similar manner. Capacitor <b>751</b>D is used to measure the X axis coordinate and resistor <b>751</b>A limits the minimum voltage V<sub>x </sub>to VCC/3. The charge and discharge logic levels for the X coordinate are also shown in TABLE 2.</p>
    <p>FIG. 8A is an illustrative flow chart for the high level control logic of an application <b>830</b> running in a host device <b>120</b> for using a remote control in accordance with this invention. Application <b>830</b> can be used as an application for a four button remote control, such as remote controls <b>610</b>, <b>615</b>, <b>617</b>, <b>660</b> and <b>680</b> described above.</p>
    <p>Application <b>830</b> can be started up by a user or automatically either immediately following a boot up sequence or by an autostart driver on detection of an inserted storage media. Application <b>830</b> initializes variables in step <b>831</b> and goes via branch <b>832</b> to step <b>833</b>. In step <b>833</b> application <b>830</b> displays the front cover and goes via branch <b>834</b> to step <b>835</b>. In step <b>835</b> application <b>830</b> waits until a button code is received from a remote control.</p>
    <p>If a button code is received, application <b>830</b> goes via branch <b>836</b> to step <b>837</b>. In step <b>837</b> application <b>830</b> checks the received button code to see if a first button (such as button <b>664</b>A of FIG. 6J) was pressed. If the first button was pressed, application <b>830</b> goes via branch <b>838</b> to step <b>839</b>. In step <b>839</b> application <b>830</b> retrieves the selection associated with the first button (such as a “SONG A” selection if button <b>664</b>A was pressed) from local (or remote storage media) and displays the retrieved selection. In one embodiment the application displays the audio recording for “Song A” through speaker <b>124</b> and optionally displays an associated video recording (if present on CD <b>663</b>A) through monitor <b>122</b>. Then application <b>830</b> goes via branches <b>840</b> and <b>841</b> back to step <b>833</b>.</p>
    <p>If in step <b>837</b> the first button was not pressed, application <b>830</b> goes via branch <b>842</b> to step <b>843</b>. In step <b>843</b> application <b>830</b> checks to see if a second button (such as button <b>664</b>B of FIG. 6J) was pressed. If the second button was pressed, application <b>830</b> retrieves and displays the associated selection (such as a “SONG B” selection). Then application <b>830</b> goes via branches <b>846</b> and <b>841</b> back to step <b>833</b>.</p>
    <p>Steps <b>843</b>, <b>848</b> and <b>853</b> are similar to step <b>837</b> and steps <b>845</b>, <b>850</b> and <b>855</b> are similar to step <b>839</b>. Therefore application <b>830</b> takes the appropriate actions if the second, third or fourth buttons are pressed in a manner similar to that described above for the first button.</p>
    <p>In one specific embodiment of an application for picture book remote control <b>610</b>, each time train button <b>612</b>A is pressed, the application retrieves and displays a different video selection of a train which is selected at random from a category of selections of train video recordings. Such an application allows children to watch selections from the categories of fire engines, trains, airplanes and helicopters by just pressing one of the four buttons <b>612</b>A, <b>612</b>B, <b>612</b>C and <b>612</b>D of remote control <b>610</b>. One advantage of such a multiple button remote control <b>610</b> is that children have a choice and can watch a scene (such as a scene of a train) as long as they want or watch a different video recording of a train by repeatedly pressing the same train button <b>612</b>A.</p>
    <p>An application similar to application <b>830</b> can also be used with other types of remote controls such as remote control <b>636</b>, <b>680</b>, <b>690</b>, and <b>696</b>. For example, an application for remote control <b>636</b> (FIG. <b>6</b>I), would merely have several additional steps corresponding to each of buttons <b>637</b>B, <b>637</b>C, <b>637</b>D, <b>638</b>A, <b>638</b>B, <b>638</b>C, <b>638</b>D, <b>639</b>A and <b>639</b>B.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, an application can make function calls to implement various functions rather than displaying selections retrieved from a storage media. For instance, instead of displaying a first selection in step <b>839</b> of application <b>830</b>, another application could make a function call which performs a first function indicated by a first button. Therefore an application for remote control <b>200</b> would have a call to a next page address calculating function for implementing the “NEXT” function/data attributes of the first button <b>225</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 8B illustrates the electronic content encoded on a storage media <b>649</b> of a periodical remote control <b>640</b> of FIGS. 6H, <b>6</b>F and <b>6</b>G. Storage media <b>649</b> is identical to storage media <b>428</b>M (FIG. <b>4</b>A). As described above, when storage media <b>649</b> is inserted into CD drive <b>122</b> of host device <b>120</b>, a security key stored in DISGOKEY.EXE <b>429</b> is first confirmed and then, DISGO.BAT <b>430</b> is executed. DISGO.BAT <b>430</b> starts up an application <b>860</b>, included in BUSWEEK.EXE <b>431</b>. BUSWEEK.EXE <b>431</b> also includes the selections of associated electronic content for remote control <b>640</b>.</p>
    <p>The selections of the associated electronic content in BUSWEEK.EXE are organized in several categories: commercial category <b>857</b>, article preview category <b>858</b> and article category <b>859</b>. Each of commercial selections <b>857</b>B, <b>857</b>C and <b>857</b>D is a 30 second full motion video recording from an advertiser (of a product or service). A preview commercial selection <b>857</b>A is a video recording from the publisher of the periodical remote control and contains highlights of all the article selections encoded in storage media <b>648</b> (FIG. <b>6</b>G). Each article preview selection <b>858</b>A, <b>858</b>B, and <b>858</b>C is a 30 second full motion video recording which summarizes the contents of the corresponding article selection. Article selections <b>859</b>A and <b>859</b>B include full length (for example, 20 minute) TV program type video recordings. A commercial selection and/or an article selection can include a DETAIL mode video recording and/or a DETAIL mode form and/or a DETAIL mode software (as described below).</p>
    <p>A DETAIL mode is a display mode which is more interactive or which provides more information than a normal mode of display. In a DETAIL mode software for a commercial selection, the user can be presented with a window through which the user can navigate to look up various products, prices, phone numbers and names from an electronic catalog. A DETAIL mode form provides more detailed information about the article or commercial selection. A DETAIL mode form can include an interactive form filling program which allows a user to order the article or service being advertised in a commercial selection. Alternatively, a DETAIL mode form can contain text corresponding to a video article identical to the text in the print version of the magazine. Such text can be displayed on monitor <b>122</b> or printed on printer <b>124</b>E (FIG. <b>1</b>E). A DETAIL mode video recording includes long infomercials. For example, a DETAIL mode video recording can include a one hour long infomercial for Nike™ shoes which contains an interview with a gold medal winner from the last olympics and an interview with a doctor. For example FIG. 8B illustrates an article selection <b>859</b>A including a full motion video recording <b>859</b>A_<b>1</b> on energy conservation and a DETAIL mode software <b>859</b>A_<b>2</b> for computing the savings in electricity bills for each user depending on the user's geographic location. Similarly article selection <b>859</b>B includes a full motion video recording <b>859</b>B_<b>1</b> and text content <b>859</b>B_<b>2</b> which is the full text of the print version of the article.</p>
    <p>FIG. 8C is an illustrative flow chart for the high level control logic of an application <b>860</b> running in a host device <b>120</b> in accordance with this invention.</p>
    <p>When started, application <b>860</b> initializes variables in step <b>861</b> and goes via branch <b>862</b> to step <b>863</b>. In step <b>863</b>, application <b>860</b> chooses the preview commercial selection <b>857</b>A as the current selection. Then application <b>860</b> goes via step <b>864</b> to step <b>865</b>. In step <b>865</b>, application <b>860</b> displays the chosen selection.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of this invention, a randomly selected commercial is displayed during an article selection display at preselected points in the article. An article selection can contain function calls to a function for displaying commercial selections at the preselected points in the article display. The call to a commercial displaying function is inserted at appropriate points in an article selection by an author of the article selection (as described below). In another embodiment of this invention, instead of a call to commercial displaying function, a tag of a unique sequence of digits is inserted.</p>
    <p>Application <b>860</b>, in step <b>865</b> (FIG. 8C) continuously compares the data being displayed with the unique sequence of digits which denotes a function call (or a tag). Once application <b>860</b> finds the function call (or tag), the article display is interrupted and a randomly selected commercial recording from the commercial category <b>857</b> is displayed. After displaying the commercial selection, application <b>860</b> resumes display of the interrupted article selection.</p>
    <p>Then application <b>860</b> goes to step <b>866</b> to check if the display of the current selection is finished. While selection is displaying via <b>865</b>, application <b>860</b> loops continuously, checking for a tag/done signal from comparison step <b>865</b>. If commercial tag is detected, application <b>860</b> goes via <b>868</b>B and <b>870</b> to <b>871</b>. Else, if the current selection display is done, application <b>860</b> goes via steps <b>867</b> and <b>878</b> to step <b>868</b>. In step <b>868</b>, application <b>860</b> checks to see if the current selection is an article selection by checking an IN_ARTICLE flag. If an article selection is being currently displayed, application <b>860</b> goes via branch <b>869</b> back to step <b>865</b>. Application <b>860</b> clears the IN_ARTICLE flag when the display of an article is completed.</p>
    <p>If an article selection is not being displayed, then application <b>860</b> goes from step <b>868</b>, via branch <b>870</b> to step <b>871</b> where a commercial selection is randomly chosen, and then retrieved and displayed in step <b>865</b>. The steps <b>871</b>, <b>865</b>, <b>866</b>, <b>868</b>A and <b>868</b> implement a continuous commercial break which displays one commercial selection after another until a button code is received. The continuous commercial break feature is very advantageous for advertisers because of continuous display of commercials during user inaction.</p>
    <p>If application <b>860</b> has not finished display of the currently chosen selection, application <b>860</b> goes from step <b>866</b> via branch <b>873</b> to step <b>874</b>. In step <b>874</b> application <b>860</b> checks to see if a button code was received from remote control <b>640</b>. If a button code was not received, application <b>860</b> goes from step <b>874</b> via branch <b>875</b> and branch <b>897</b> back to step <b>865</b>. If a valid button code was received, application <b>860</b> goes from step <b>874</b> via branch <b>876</b> to step <b>877</b>.</p>
    <p>In step <b>877</b>, application <b>860</b> checks to see if the button code received from remote control <b>640</b> indicates that SKIP function button <b>645</b>B was pressed. If SKIP function button <b>645</b>B was pressed, application <b>860</b> immediately terminates the selection being currently displayed and goes from step <b>877</b> via branch <b>878</b> to step <b>868</b> (described above). Therefore a user can press SKIP function button <b>645</b>B to skip a commercial that has rudely interrupted an article being displayed to the user. Pressing skip while in an article terminates the article and application <b>860</b> goes directly to a continuous commercial break. If the received button code does not correspond to the SKIP function button <b>645</b>B, application <b>860</b> goes from step <b>877</b> via branch <b>879</b> to step <b>880</b>.</p>
    <p>In step <b>880</b>, application <b>860</b> checks to see if the received button code corresponds to the INFO function button <b>645</b>D. If the button codes match in step <b>880</b>, application <b>860</b> goes via branch <b>881</b> to step <b>882</b>. In step <b>882</b>, application <b>860</b> increments the DETAIL mode level which indicates the level at which an article or a commercial is being displayed.</p>
    <p>After incrementing the DETAIL mode level in step <b>882</b>, application <b>860</b> goes via branch <b>883</b> and branch <b>897</b> back to step <b>865</b>. Although the application is back in the same selection as before, the DETAIL mode is now higher than when application <b>860</b> was last in step <b>865</b>.</p>
    <p>In one specific embodiment of this invention, DETAIL mode level <b>0</b> for commercial selections indicates a 30 second commercial, while DETAIL mode level <b>1</b> indicates an infomercial and a DETAIL mode level <b>2</b> indicates an interactive form to be filled by a user (for example to order the product being advertised in a commercial).</p>
    <p>In an alternative embodiment, an application is programmed to perform additional functions in the increased DETAIL mode level. For example, in DETAIL mode <b>1</b>, the application continues displaying the currently chosen selection and also displays in a window an order form or an 800 telephone number if a commercial selection was being displayed.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, an application can execute a software selection which sends a fax through phone line <b>145</b>A (FIG. 1G) to order the product currently being advertised. In another embodiment, an application shows a menu that allows a user to input information about attributes of the advertised product (such as shoe size) to be ordered for the user.</p>
    <p>In one specific embodiment of this invention, an application sends an order for a product via facsimile using fax card <b>144</b>B and phone line <b>145</b>A (FIG <b>1</b>F). A user's credit card number is automatically filled in by the application, if a user so desires (after asking for a password in some embodiments).</p>
    <p>In an increased DETAIL mode level, application <b>860</b> can display a form which provides additional information about the advertised product, such as the price and shops in the local neighborhood where the product is available.</p>
    <p>The DETAIL mode is decremented when the current selection completes. The DETAIL mode is also decremented when a commercial is terminated due to user input, for example if SKIP function button <b>645</b>B is pressed by the user. Once the DETAIL mode has been decremented, the next selection is displayed in the normal mode unless INFO function button <b>645</b>D is pressed by the user during display of the current selection.</p>
    <p>In one specific embodiment of this invention, when an inventor presses INFO function button <b>645</b>D, during a NIKE infomercial, an interactive window with a form for ordering shoes is presented. In this manner, an ambitious advertiser can have several levels of DETAIL mode selections stacked one after another which are accessed by using INFO function button <b>645</b>D in each level. Less ambitious advertisers can choose not to implement INFO function button <b>645</b>D so that pressing INFO function button <b>645</b>D causes nothing to change and the 30 second commercial runs to its conclusion with a little window in a corner displaying the text content “no detail available”.</p>
    <p>The DETAIL mode can be implemented for an article selection, wherein the normal level of the DETAIL mode (e.g. level <b>1</b>) is associated with a video, and the next higher level of the DETAIL mode is associated with the full text of the article in the print version of the magazine. Pressing INFO function button <b>645</b>D multiple times eventually rotates back to level <b>0</b>. In one embodiment of this invention, a user can search for keywords in article selections using keypad <b>643</b> to enter the keyword to be searched (FIG. <b>6</b>G). In one embodiment for articles, a DETAIL mode of <b>0</b> indicates an article preview selection, a DETAIL mode of indicates article selections <b>1</b> and a DETAIL mode greater than 1 indicates more information than normal. An article preview selection is displayed when a user single clicks on an article in a periodical the remote control (as discussed below).</p>
    <p>Referring back to FIG. 8C, if the button codes do not match in step <b>880</b>, application <b>860</b> goes via branch <b>884</b> to step <b>885</b>. In step <b>885</b>, application <b>860</b> checks to see if the received button code indicates that REPEAT function button <b>645</b>C was pressed. If the button codes match in step <b>885</b>, application <b>860</b> goes via branch <b>886</b> to step <b>887</b>. In step <b>887</b>, application <b>860</b> selects the most recently displayed commercial selection. Then application <b>860</b> goes from step <b>887</b> via branches <b>888</b> and <b>897</b> back to step <b>865</b>. Therefore in step <b>865</b>, the previous commercial will be displayed. In one embodiment of this invention, application <b>860</b> keeps track of 255 most recently displayed commercials (in reverse chronological order).</p>
    <p>If the button codes do not match in step <b>885</b>, application <b>860</b> goes via branch <b>889</b> to step <b>890</b>. In step <b>890</b>, application <b>860</b> checks to see if an article button was double clicked. If there was a double click in step <b>890</b>, application <b>860</b> goes via branch <b>894</b> to step <b>895</b>. In step <b>895</b>, application <b>860</b> selects the article indicated by the button code received from remote control <b>640</b> and sets the IN_ARTICLE flag. Then application <b>860</b> goes via branches <b>896</b> and <b>897</b> back to step <b>865</b>.</p>
    <p>If, however, there was no double click in step <b>890</b>, application <b>860</b> goes via branch <b>891</b> to step <b>892</b>. In step <b>892</b>, application <b>860</b> selects the article preview commercial indicated by the button code is received from remote control <b>640</b>. Then application <b>860</b> goes via branch <b>893</b> and <b>897</b> back to step <b>865</b>.</p>
    <p>Application <b>860</b> makes it easy to convert existing magazines and TV programs to interactive media format, for remote controls which are easy to market and easy to use (as discussed below).</p>
    <p>To author an application for a picture book remote control one simply has to do the following:</p>
    <p>1. Create the pictures, scan them into a computer and store them in separate files;</p>
    <p>2. Write the captions for each page and store each in a separate file;</p>
    <p>3. Record the voice for each caption (using a PC sound card) and store in separate disk files;</p>
    <p>4. Run a Compiler Engine to generate an application.</p>
    <p>FIG. 9A is an illustrative data flow diagram for an interactive media application development system <b>900</b>. Application development system <b>900</b> is used in accordance with a method <b>910</b> illustrated in FIG. <b>9</b>B. Application development system <b>900</b> includes a data input system <b>901</b> and an application authoring system <b>906</b>. Data input system <b>901</b> includes a scanner <b>902</b>, a camera and full motion video card <b>903</b>, a microphone and sound card <b>904</b> and a word processor <b>905</b>. In one specific embodiment of this invention, application development system <b>900</b> includes an IBM PC.</p>
    <p>In one specific embodiment of this invention an application <b>909</b> created by application creation engine <b>908</b> includes high level control logic <b>909</b>A, and selections <b>909</b>B, <b>909</b>C, <b>909</b>D, <b>909</b>E, <b>909</b>F and <b>909</b>G all combined into a single executable image.</p>
    <p>To create an application <b>909</b> an author can use a scanner <b>902</b> and/or camera and full motion video card <b>903</b> and/or microphone and sound card and/or <b>904</b> and/or word processor <b>905</b> depending on the application to be created. In step <b>911</b> of method <b>910</b>, the author uses a scanner <b>902</b>. (FIG. 9A) to produce picture files such as picture files <b>902</b>A, <b>902</b>B and <b>902</b>C in step <b>911</b> (FIG. <b>9</b>B). Scanner <b>902</b> can be any commercially available scanner such as, HP ScanJet IIcx scanner available from Hewlett Packard Company, 16399 W. Bernardo Drive, San Diego, Calif. 92127. Scanner <b>902</b> converts color pages into digitized data for the picture files.</p>
    <p>Next in step <b>912</b>, (FIG. 9B) an author uses camera and full motion video card <b>903</b> to create video files <b>903</b>A, <b>903</b>B and <b>903</b>C which have full motion imagery. Camera and full motion video card <b>903</b> is any commercially available video card such as, Real Magic MPEG full-motion video card available from Future Tel. Corp., (402) 522-1400, 1092 E. Arques Avenue, Sunnyvale, Calif. 94086.</p>
    <p>Next, in step <b>913</b>, an author uses microphone and sound card <b>904</b> to create sound files <b>904</b>A, <b>904</b>B and <b>904</b>C. Microphone and sound card <b>904</b> can be any commercially available audio card such as, ProAudio Spectrum 16 audio card available from Media Vision, Inc., 47300 Bayside Parkway, Fremont, Calif. 94538. Sound card <b>904</b> digitizes and plays back sounds and voices input by an author.</p>
    <p>Next, in step <b>914</b>, the author uses a word processor <b>905</b> to create text files <b>905</b>A, <b>905</b>B and <b>905</b>C. Word processor <b>905</b> can be any commercially available word processor such as, WordPerfect available from WordPerfect Corporation, 155 N. Technology Way, Orem, Utah 84057. Word processor <b>905</b> is used to type text content.</p>
    <p>Files <b>902</b>A, <b>902</b>B, <b>902</b>C, <b>903</b>A, <b>903</b>B, <b>903</b>C, <b>904</b>A, <b>904</b>B, <b>904</b>C, <b>905</b>A, <b>905</b>B, and <b>905</b>C all contain digitized data which are input to application authoring system <b>906</b>. Application authoring system <b>906</b> includes an author interface <b>907</b> and an application creation engine <b>908</b>. Application creation engine <b>908</b> receives commands from an author via author interface <b>907</b> and uses data files <b>902</b>A, <b>902</b>B, <b>902</b>C, <b>903</b>A, <b>903</b>B, <b>903</b>C, <b>904</b>A, <b>904</b>B, <b>904</b>C, <b>905</b>A, <b>905</b>B, and <b>905</b>C from data input system <b>901</b> to create an application <b>909</b>. Application <b>909</b> contains the associated electronic contents for the remote control being created.</p>
    <p>In step <b>915</b>, an author starts application authoring system <b>906</b>. Then in step <b>916</b>, an author selects the type of remote control to be created from a menu (not shown) which lists a single button remote control and a multiple button remote control as two choices.</p>
    <p>Next, in step <b>917</b>, an author associates the buttons on a remote control such as remote control <b>100</b> with the data files from the data input system <b>901</b> to create an application such as application <b>909</b>. Step <b>917</b> is illustrated in detail for two different applications: flow chart <b>917</b>A illustrates the steps to create an application for a single button remote control while flow chart <b>917</b>B illustrates the steps to create an application for a multiple button remote control. Flow charts <b>917</b>A and <b>917</b>B are discussed in detail below.</p>
    <p>Next in step <b>918</b> the author selects a create command from a menu (not shown) of application authoring system <b>906</b> to generate a master disk or tape which includes application <b>909</b>. Then in step <b>919</b> an author delivers the master disk or tape to a service bureau for duplication. The duplicated disks or tapes containing application <b>909</b> can be encased in a holder of a remote control or alternatively, transferred to storage media connected to remote servers which permit access by users, host devices.</p>
    <p>FIG. 9C illustrates a screen <b>907</b>A of author interface <b>907</b> for creating an application for a single button remote control. Initially an author selects from menu bar <b>924</b>, format menu <b>924</b>B. On selecting format menu <b>924</b>B, a drop down list box (not shown) appears which allows an author to select one of several predetermined layouts of the function/data buttons for single or multiple button remote control. Each of these layouts can be illustrated in screen <b>931</b>A when an author scrolls through the various choices. For example, the drop down list box for format menu <b>924</b>B can include choices of “single button picture book remote control”, “periodical remote control” and “multiple button remote control”. In step <b>916</b> (FIG. 9B) the author selects the type of remote control from format menu <b>924</b>B.</p>
    <p>After selecting the layout of the function/data buttons for a remote control, an author must indicate whether to start a new remote control or to work on an existing remote control from drop down list box <b>933</b> for file menu <b>924</b>A. Once a choice has been indicated in drop down list box <b>933</b>, the current file directory is selected and dialog box <b>925</b> is presented to the author.</p>
    <p>Dialog box <b>925</b> includes screen <b>931</b>A, authoring boxes <b>938</b>A and authoring buttons <b>939</b>A. Dialog box <b>925</b> follows the well known design conventions for Microsoft Windows and for the Apple MacIntosh. In the top left corner, dialog box <b>925</b> has a system bar <b>921</b> which allows an author to exit author interface <b>907</b> by double clicking. Furthermore, dialog box <b>925</b> has adjacent to system bar <b>921</b>, a title bar <b>922</b>A which shows the name of the application being created. Just below title bar <b>922</b>A in menu bar <b>924</b> is presented current book format <b>923</b>A “Single Button Picture Book” (as soon as the author makes a selection in format menu <b>924</b>B).</p>
    <p>Dialog box <b>925</b> also includes a set of authoring boxes <b>938</b>A (at the right side of FIG. <b>9</b>C). Authoring box set <b>938</b>A includes prompt legends <b>926</b>, <b>927</b>, <b>928</b>, <b>929</b> and <b>930</b> and corresponding input boxes <b>926</b>A, <b>927</b>A, <b>928</b>A, <b>929</b>A and <b>930</b>A. Box <b>927</b>A is a drop down list box which lists all of the valid page numbers available for the current book. Furthermore, boxes <b>928</b>A, <b>929</b>A and <b>930</b>A are drop down list boxes which contain the lists of graphics files, sound files and text files respectively.</p>
    <p>In one specific embodiment of this invention, picture files <b>902</b>A, <b>902</b>B, and <b>902</b>C are named with the extension .TIF, sound files <b>904</b>A, <b>904</b>B and <b>904</b>C have the extension .WAV and text files <b>905</b>A, <b>905</b>B and <b>905</b>C have the extension .TXT. Once a valid set of data files are displayed in a drop down list box, an author can select a particular entry in the box by double clicking on the entry. For example, in drop down list box <b>930</b>A, to select text file “page5.txt” the author double clicks on entry <b>930</b>A<b>1</b> as shown in FIG. <b>9</b>C.</p>
    <p>In step <b>917</b>A<b>1</b> (FIG. 9B) an author specifies the number of pages for a picture book remote control application in input box <b>926</b>A. In step <b>917</b>A<b>2</b>, an author chooses the current page to be worked on in box <b>927</b>A. Box <b>927</b>A displays all of the valid pages which can be programmed for the picture book remote control such as, a front cover, page 1, page 2, page 3, and back cover. In one embodiment of this invention, when an author selects the current page of the application to be worked on, that page is automatically associated with the single button of the remote control.</p>
    <p>In step <b>917</b>A<b>3</b>, an author associates the single button of the remote control and associated current page to a graphic file containing the image to be displayed in the current page by double clicking on the graphics file in box <b>928</b>A. Then in step <b>917</b>A<b>4</b>, an author associates the single button and the current page to a sound file containing an audio recording to be displayed in the current page by double-clicking on the sound file in <b>929</b>A. Finally, in step <b>917</b>A<b>5</b>, an author associates the single button and the current page to a text file by double-clicking on the text file in box <b>930</b>A.</p>
    <p>For example, if a ten page picture book remote control application is to be created, an author types the number 10 in box <b>926</b>A, and to work on page 5 the author double clicks on the number 5 in box <b>927</b>A.</p>
    <p>Once a data file has been associated with the current page the data file can be accessed through screen <b>931</b>A (FIG. <b>9</b>C). For example, as soon as a graphics file is selected in window <b>928</b>A, the graphics data are displayed on edit screen <b>931</b>. As another example, when a text file is selected in window <b>930</b>A, the text file is displayed (overlapping the graphics in the same screen <b>931</b>A). In one specific embodiment of this invention, the text <b>932</b> from text file <b>930</b>A<b>1</b> can be moved or the size changed using “handles” <b>932</b>A, <b>932</b>B, <b>932</b>C and <b>932</b>D in the conventional manner established for Microsoft Windows and for Apple MacIntosh. For example, to move text <b>932</b>, the cursor is positioned on text <b>932</b> and the left mouse button is held down while a mouse (such as mouse <b>129</b>) is moved.</p>
    <p>Also included in dialog box <b>925</b> are preview buttons <b>939</b>A, which include Play button <b>935</b>, Next button <b>936</b> and Previous button <b>937</b>. Play button <b>935</b> displays the sound file associated with the current page. In the example of FIG. 9B, selecting Play button <b>935</b> causes the sound file “page5.wav” to be displayed through the speaker/headphone (not shown). Next button <b>936</b> and previous button <b>937</b> permit an author to move to another page such as the next page or the previous page of the current application.</p>
    <p>The application for a single button picture book remote control created by method <b>910</b> (FIG. 9B) results in an interactive media in which the pages are arranged in a specific sequential order. The pages are retrieved and displayed sequentially on the receipt of a wireless signal from the button on the remote control. Therefore, although a single button is linked to all pages, an application retrieves and displays only the next page in sequential order after the current page when a button code is received.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of this invention, an application <b>549</b> for picture book remote control <b>100</b> can be authored as follows. The cover and inside pages of an existing children's book can be scanned and each page graphic saved in a separate file having the extension “TIF”, such as, for example “COVER.TIF”, “PAGE1.TIF”, “PAGE2.TIF”, and “PAGE10.TIF”. Next the text on each of the pages of the children's book can be read by the author and recorded with each voice recording being stored in a separate file, having the extension “WAV” such as, for example “COVER.WAV”, “PAGE1.WAV”, PAGE2.WAV” and “PAGE10.WAV”.</p>
    <p>Files COVER.TIF, COVER.WAV, PAGE 1.TIF, PAGE 2.WAV, PAGE 10.TIF and PAGE 10.WAV from the above steps can be used to create the application by using Compel, a commercial business presentation software published by Asymetrix Corporation of 110-110th Avenue, NE Suite 700, Bellevue, Wash. 98004.</p>
    <p>Compel has a menu driven interface. To create an application <b>549</b>, a blank slide is first created using various Compel menus and dialog boxes. For example, Compel dialog box “Effects” is used to choose “Slide Media Links” which is a pull down menu in Compel. Then “Trigger Event” is chosen which is a pull down scroll box and in menu Trigger Event, the action “Leave Slide” is chosen. When an action is chosen, a pull down scroll box is displayed containing all the data files. One of these files called “Page 2.WAV” can be then selected. Then the Import Graphic Command is used to select “Page 2.TIF” to insert a graphic image on the blank slide. For a cover, Compel “import” and “graphic” menu boxes are used to place a “COVER.TIF” graphic on top of the very first blank slide.</p>
    <p>Compel automatically advances to the next slide after a trigger event “leave slide” which causes an associated sound recording to be displayed. To display the same graphics after displaying a sound recording, the first slide is duplicated as a second slide. The action “do nothing” is specified for all trigger events for the (duplicated) second slide.</p>
    <p>Therefore every page of an interactive media displayed to the user requires two slides. So a third slide can be then opened and the next page's graphic “PAGE1.TIF” placed on the third slide. Then the sound file “PAGE1.WAV” can be associated to the third slide. In this manner all of the graphics files and all of the sound files can be linked to corresponding pairs of slides in the desired sequential order, the first slide of each pair being associated with a sound file and the second slide of each pair having the same graphic as the first slide of the pair.</p>
    <p>When application <b>549</b> is completed, the application can be saved in a file called “FIREBOOK.CPL”. The “FIREBOOK.CPL” and a run-time version of the Compel program (henceforth “compel application”) can be transferred to a storage media such as CD-ROM compatible write once optical disk. The transfer can be done by a Sony CD Recording Unit CDW-900E available from Sony Electronics, Inc., 3300 Zanker Road, San Jose, Calif. 95134.</p>
    <p>A compel application, when started up and prompted with “FIREBOOK” responds to a button code from the remote control. In particular, the compel application causes advancing of each slide on receipt of a left mouse button code from a remote control. Therefore if a left mouse button code is received by compel application during display of the first slide, compel application exits the first slide and while exiting displays the sound file associated with the first slide. Then compel application displays the second slide (which has a graphic identical to the graphic of the first slide). If a left mouse button is received during display of the second slide, compel application exits the second slide and immediately displays the third slide.</p>
    <p>After displaying the last slide of a selection, compel application re-displays the first slide on receipt of a left mouse button code. Although the left mouse button code is used in one embodiment of an application for a picture book remote control, other applications can use other button codes such as scan codes for Fl key or enter key in accordance with this invention. The file name of an application such as FIREBOOK.EXE can be included in a file such as DISGO.BAT <b>430</b> (FIG. SE).</p>
    <p>In an alternative embodiment of this invention, a storage media can be used with a host device not configured with the autostart driver by the user manually issuing the command COMPEL X:FIREBOOK wherein X denotes the peripheral containing the inserted storage media.</p>
    <p>While in one embodiment of this invention, the Compel application was used, a programmer skilled in the art can create such an application or other compatible applications using a programming language (such as C) and associated development systems for an IBM compatible PC or an Apple Macintosh. A programmer can also create similar applications by using software development systems available from video game machine manufacturers such as Sega, Nintendo and 3DO.</p>
    <p>An application which maps every page to the same button and which allows sequential access of the pages is well suited for a children's picture book remote control such as picture book remote control <b>100</b>.</p>
    <p>An application for random access of articles for a multiple button remote control can be created by associating buttons to different articles. One such application for a periodical remote control is illustrated in FIG. <b>8</b>C.</p>
    <p>To create an application for a periodical remote control, an author selects “periodical remote control” from format menu <b>924</b>B. Then an author either starts a new periodical remote control application or opens an existing periodical remote control application from file menu <b>924</b>A.</p>
    <p>FIG. 9D illustrates a screen <b>907</b>B of author interface <b>907</b> for creating an application for a periodical remote control. Authoring buttons <b>938</b>B for a periodical remote control include #Buttons legend <b>942</b>. Current button legend <b>943</b>, Information file legend <b>944</b>, Commercial file legend <b>945</b>, Article file legend <b>946</b> and corresponding input boxes <b>942</b>A, <b>943</b>A, <b>944</b>A, <b>945</b>A and <b>946</b>A. An author specifies the number of article selections in input box <b>942</b>A, in step <b>917</b>B<b>1</b> (FIG. <b>9</b>B).</p>
    <p>Using the number of article selections, an author can choose one layout from several preprogrammed layouts for the buttons of a periodical remote control. For example, to create a six-selection remote control, an author types in the number “6” in the input box <b>942</b>A.</p>
    <p>Next in step <b>917</b>B<b>2</b> the author chooses a button to be worked on from drop down list box <b>943</b>A. Each button number uniquely identifies the location of a button on a layout for a remote control which is displayed to the author on screen <b>931</b> (not shown). For example, to work on article 3, an author double clicks on the number “3” in the box <b>943</b>A.</p>
    <p>Next in step <b>917</b>B<b>3</b> the author associates the video recording article file that will be displayed with the corresponding button on the remote control by double clicking on the desired article file such as “article3.AVI” <b>946</b>A<b>1</b> in box <b>946</b>A. A video recording article preview file is associated with a corresponding button on the remote control by single clicking on the desired article preview file such as “contents.avi.”</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of this invention, a DETAIL mode file can be associated with an article selection or a commercial selection. The DETAIL mode file is displayed when a user touches button INFO <b>645</b>D during the display of a commercial selection or an article selection.</p>
    <p>Information box <b>944</b>A lists choices of DETAIL mode files which can be associated with article and/or commercial selections. For example, file “quote27.exe” can be associated with an article selection by clicking on a desired article selection such as “article3.avi” and then double clicking on file “quote27.exe”. Alternatively, DETAIL mode file “quote27.exe” can be associated with a commercial selection such as “spot27.adv” by first clicking on the commercial selection in box <b>945</b>A and then double clicking on the DETAIL mode file.</p>
    <p>Multiple levels of DETAIL can be setup by associating a DETAIL mode file to a lower level DETAIL mode file until the lowest level DETAIL mode file is reached and the lowest level DETAIL mode file is associated with the article selection or the commercial selection from which the DETAIL mode was originally entered. For example, an author clicks on “quote 27.EXE” in <b>944</b>A and then while holding down the CTRL key, double clicks on “ORDER27.EXE” in <b>944</b>A. In accordance with this invention, DETAIL mode files can be full motion video, and/or text and/or graphics and/or computer programs.</p>
    <p>In FIG. 9D, screen <b>931</b>B, an edit screen, shows the first frame of the current video article “article3.AVI”. Dialog box <b>925</b>B includes authoring buttons <b>939</b>B which include PREVIEW button <b>951</b>, Play button <b>952</b>, Stop button <b>953</b>, Backward button <b>954</b>, Forward button <b>955</b> and Insert Commercial button <b>956</b>.</p>
    <p>When Play button <b>952</b> is clicked by an author, the current article, commercial or DETAIL mode file is displayed on screen <b>931</b>B. When Stop button <b>953</b> is clicked, the display of current video and/or and audio recording selection is frozen. When Backward button <b>954</b> or the Forward button <b>955</b> are clicked, the video and/or audio recording is rewound or advanced respectively. The rate of video advance and rewind starts and runs very slowly. The rate of video advance accelerates when the mouse button is held down for an extended period of time.</p>
    <p>When Insert Commercial button <b>956</b> is clicked during display of an article selection, a function call (or a tag) for an automatic commercial call is inserted at the current position in the article selection “article3.AVI.”</p>
    <p>In an alternative embodiment of this invention, an author can insert selected commercials into an article selection (rather than calls to display a random commercial). The available commercials are listed in Commercial file box <b>945</b>A and selected by double-clicking a commercial selection in box <b>945</b>A immediately after inserting a function call (or a tag).</p>
    <p>When the Preview button <b>951</b> is clicked, author interface <b>907</b> switches from editing mode to a preview mode which allows an author to “test drive” the current periodical remote control. Authoring buttons <b>939</b>B are replaced with preview buttons <b>939</b>C which include Author button <b>951</b>A, SKIP button <b>951</b>B, REPEAT button <b>951</b>C and INFO button <b>951</b>D. When Author button <b>951</b>A is clicked, screen <b>931</b> returns to the editing mode.</p>
    <p>To preview the periodical remote control after entering the preview mode an author double clicks on a file name <b>946</b>A<b>1</b> in Article File box <b>946</b>A. Article selection “article 3.avi” <b>946</b>A<b>1</b> will play in screen <b>931</b> with automatic commercials being called when appropriate, as if a user had touched button <b>3</b>. INFO button <b>951</b>D, SKIP button <b>951</b>B and REPEAT button <b>951</b>C function in the manner specified above in reference to periodical remote control <b>640</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 9E illustrates a screen <b>907</b>C of author interface <b>907</b> for creating an application for use with a touch panel remote control. Format menu <b>924</b>B includes choices (Pub. Type, Button Type, Draw Button, Draw Page, Button #, Attributes, and Rulers) in a drop down list box <b>966</b>. An author can specify arbitrary shaped buttons on a touch panel remote control by selecting “Draw Button” in drop down list box <b>966</b> for the format menu <b>924</b>B.</p>
    <p>Then screen <b>931</b>C displays two pages 960A and 960B. The author then chooses Draw Page from drop down list box <b>966</b> of format menu <b>924</b>B to define the size and shape of the magazine page as well as the buttons. The author then selects one of tools <b>964</b>A, <b>964</b>B, <b>964</b>C, <b>964</b>D, <b>964</b>E, <b>964</b>F and <b>964</b>G from the button drawing tool list <b>964</b>. For instance, an author selects the box tool <b>964</b>D to draw button <b>961</b>A on screen <b>960</b>A and button <b>961</b>C on <b>960</b>B. On drawing the periphery of a button the author interface <b>907</b>C prompts the author to specify a button number in input box <b>965</b> before proceeding to draw the periphery of another button. Button <b>961</b>B is drawn with a circular drawing tool <b>964</b>E while the button <b>961</b>D is drawn with a free form drawing tool <b>964</b>F. Selection tool <b>964</b>A can be used to reposition a button while rotation tool <b>964</b>G can be used to rotate the button.</p>
    <p>When an author has completed drawing of all of the buttons on a touch panel, the author then clicks the OK button <b>962</b> to save the current configuration of buttons on a touch panel. Alternatively, clicking on CANCEL button <b>963</b> aborts any changes made during the current drawing session.</p>
    <p>FIG. 9F is an illustrative flow chart for application creation engine <b>908</b> of FIG. <b>9</b>A. Application creation engine <b>908</b> initializes variables in step <b>971</b> and goes to step <b>972</b> where it gets the remote control type-from the author (in format menu <b>924</b>B). Then application creation engine <b>908</b> goes to step <b>973</b> where it gets the total number of selections in the remote control application being created (in input box <b>942</b>A of FIG. <b>9</b>D). Next in step <b>974</b>, application creation engine <b>908</b> gets the button code of the function/data button which is to be associated with current selection being programmed (in input box <b>943</b>A).</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of this invention, an author needs to merely enter the total number of selections and the number of selections automatically indicates the preselected layout. In such an embodiment, selecting a button number in input box <b>943</b>A indicates the location of the button and also a unique button code to be encoded in a wireless signal identifying the selected button.</p>
    <p>In step <b>975</b>, application creation engine <b>908</b> gets a graphics file name and associates the graphics file with the current selection. In step <b>976</b>, application creation engine <b>908</b> gets the video file name and associates the video file with the current selection. In step <b>977</b>, application creation engine <b>908</b> gets the text file name and associates the text file with the current selection. Steps <b>975</b>, <b>976</b> and <b>977</b> are optional steps which can be executed in any order by an author. However, at least one of steps <b>975</b>, <b>976</b>, and <b>977</b> must be executed before proceeding to next step <b>978</b>.</p>
    <p>In step <b>978</b>, application creation engine <b>908</b> associates the button code of the currently selected button with the memory address of the selection formed by the preceding steps <b>975</b> and/or <b>976</b> and/or <b>977</b>. In one embodiment, application creation engine <b>908</b> stores the button code in the selection data storage location which is offset from the selection's beginning memory address by a predetermined amount of offset. As noted above, such storage allows the selection associated with a button code to be identified by an application.</p>
    <p>Finally in step <b>979</b>, application creation engine <b>908</b> checks to see if all of the selections for the current interactive media have been associated with the respective button codes. If all of the selections have been associated, the current application is finished and application creation engine <b>908</b> goes from step <b>979</b> via branch <b>980</b> back to step <b>972</b> to get the next remote control type. If not all of the selections for the current remote control have been programmed, application creation engine <b>908</b> goes from step <b>979</b> via branch <b>981</b> to step <b>974</b> where it gets the button code of the next button.</p>
    <p>One advantage of the remote control application authoring system and method described above is simplicity, which allows anyone to author an application for an interactive media with minimal training. The above procedure is also less labor intensive with the resultant cost savings and allows rapid prototyping with short time to market.</p>
    <p>A remote control in accordance with this invention improves a user's interaction with interactive media for a number of reasons. One is interactive media is easier to produce because this invention makes it easy to repurpose existing non-interactive media into interactive media. For example, a normal children's printed book, such as a picture book, can be made interactive by simply scanning pages of the book and then recording and saving the pages into graphic files and then recording text audio for the text on each page into voice recording files. Such a remote control allows the child to simply push a button to read the book on a television, a page at a time. For example, a thousand Disney titles can be taken and repurposed virtually overnight into interactive media. Interactive media is also made easier to sell or market because the remote control looks like non-interactive media in the store so a publisher can sell the remote in normal conventional bookstores or for example in the case of a disk video CD or audio CD in normal record stores in normal record stores like Blockbuster video. Interactive media is also easier to use with the remote control because the interactive media still feels like normal TV or normal book or normal magazine rather than like computer software. Normal computer software is difficult because software requires the use of a mouse and double clicking and icons and typing commands and some minimal computer skills which can be roadblocks to people who never used computers. In the case of a printed publication remote control, a user does exactly what the user does with a normal book. The user opens a book and the user looks at the table of contents and the user says to himself or herself touching the picture, “This is what I want to watch.” The TV program that the user just selected is then shown on the TV or the CD audio selection that the user wants to listen to is played as soon as the user touches the title. The user never needs to think about what to do. In all cases, the remote allows the user immediate access to interactive media without having to read the manual.</p>
    <p>A data button remote control looks like a normal remote control but has different buttons for example MARS, EARTH and PLUTO. Where as conventional computer game remote controls require that the user first read the manual, with a remote control in accordance with this invention it is not necessary to read the manual to understand what the controls do, what the remote control does. The user doesn't have to remember the instructions. A remote control in accordance with this invention relates in an intuitive way to the user, because the buttons on the remote control can be optimized for each game (rather than be universal) and different for each game (rather than requiring the user to remember that a button C for example causes one thing for one game and the same button C causes the game to quit for another game).</p>
    <p>It is to be understood that the above description is intended to be illustrative and not restrictive. Many variations of the invention will become apparent to those of skill in the art upon review of this disclosure. For example, a video cassette recorder (VCR) tape can be used as the storage media and data buttons can be supported on the VCR tape housing for remotely selecting movies encoded in the VCR tape. One embodiment of a printed publication remote control can be similar to a restaurant menu for purchasing various dishes. Another embodiment of a printed publication remote control can be an information brochure such as a product brochure and a company brochure. Yet another embodiment of a printed publication remote control can have the appearance of a picture post card. A remote control in accordance with this invention can have the appearance of a conventional TV program guide, or a conventional newspaper and need not contain a storage media (i.e. in the form of a printed publication remote control).</p>
    <p>Although the remote control embodiments have been shown with a number of data buttons for accessing certain selections and/or a number of function buttons for implementing functions, any types of buttons having any attributes of data and/or function can be built into a remote control in accordance with this invention.</p>
    <p>Moreover, associations between button codes and selections can be implemented as a table of pointers, with the button code as the index into the table and the pointers being addresses of the selections on the storage media. Alternatively, the associations can be implemented using other data structures such as linked lists which are well known to a person of skill in the art.</p>
    <p>The scope of this invention is limited only by the appended claims.</p>
