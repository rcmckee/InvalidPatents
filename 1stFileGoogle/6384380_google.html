Each heating compartment is independently heat controlled via a controller, and includes a heating assembly including a heater, a U-shaped heating plate, a temperature sensor and a cut-out switch for disabling the heater when a threshold temperature is exceeded. The desired or set point temperature for each heating compartment may be independently entered to the controller via an input device. The heating plate has a generally U-shaped configuration with a thermally conductive bottom wall and thermally conductive side walls extending therefrom. The heater is typically affixed to the underside of the bottom wall, wherein, upon heating of the bottom wall, heat is conducted through the side walls to provide an even distribution of heat to medical items placed within the heating compartment. Each heating compartment may further include a collapsible rack structure allowing a user to selectively partition each heating compartment based upon the specific types of medical items to be heated.</div>

    <heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading> <p>This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/158,507, entitled “Temperature Controlled Cabinet System and Method for Heating Items to Desired Temperatures”, and filed Oct. 8, 1999. The disclosure of the above-mentioned provisional application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>1. Technical Field</p>
    <p>The present invention pertains to systems for heating medical items. In particular, the present invention pertains to a system for heating and maintaining medical solution containers (e.g., bags or bottles containing saline or intravenous (IV) solutions, antibiotics or other drugs, blood, etc.) or other medical items (e.g., instruments, blankets, etc.) at desired temperatures by providing an even distribution of heat to the medical items placed within the system.</p>
    <p>2. Discussion of Related Art</p>
    <p>Generally, various items are required to be heated prior to utilization in a medical procedure to prevent thermal shock and injury to a patient. These items typically include intravenous solution, surgical instruments, bottles and blankets. In order to provide the necessary heated items for use in medical procedures, medical personnel may utilize several types of warming systems to heat items toward their operational temperatures. For example, ovens may be disposed within operating rooms to heat items to desired temperatures. Further, U.S. Pat. No. 4,419,568 (Van Overloop) discloses a wet dressings heater having a base with side walls defining a cavity, and an insert connected to the base and defining at least one recess in the cavity for receiving wet dressings. A heater has an electrical heating element in close proximity to the insert recess for heating the wet dressings, while the temperature of the heating element is controlled in a desired temperature range for those wet dressings.</p>
    <p>U.S. Pat. No. 4,495,402 (Burdick et al) discloses a warmer for heating wet dressings and other articles disposed within a heating and storage compartment. The articles are arranged within the compartment in stacked relation and disposed on a plate that is supplied with thermal energy from a heater. The plate includes a center aperture whereby a first thermal sensor is disposed in the aperture in contact with a bottommost article. Control circuitry is disposed beneath the plate to control the heater to maintain temperature ofthe bottommost article at a desired level based on the temperatures sensed by the first thermal sensor and a second thermal sensor responsive to heater temperature.</p>
    <p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,408,576 (Bishop) discloses an intravenous fluid warmer having a cabinet structure to accommodate a plurality of intravenous fluid bags. A temperature sensor and pad of heating filaments are disposed within the cabinet structure, whereby the temperature sensor enables automatic temperature regulation of the pad of heating filaments to heat the intravenous fluid bags. The heating filaments are covered by a rubber layer to prevent melting of the bags during heating. A temperature indicator disposed on the cabinet structure permits a user to ascertain when a desired temperature is attained, whereby an intravenous fluid bag is removed from the intravenous fluid warmer via an opening defined in a side of the cabinet structure.</p>
    <p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,986,239 (Corrigan, III et al.) discloses a conductive warmer for flexible plastic bags. The warmer includes a heat-conducting member of thermally conductive material having a plurality of fins which are parallel and spaced apart to define a plurality of bag-receiving compartments. The fins are connected to a back portion of the heat-conducting member to which a heating element is attached in a heat-exchanging relationship. The heating element conducts heat through the back portion and fins of the heat-conducting member to the bags.</p>
    <p>In addition, the related art provides warming systems for other types of items. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,605,840 (Koopman) discloses a horizontal holding cabinet for prepared food, wherein the cabinet has a plurality of drawer-containing modules arranged side-by-side to each other. Each module has a heating element and an integral water reservoir and is capable of being independently heated and humidified. The modules each further include a drawer receiving cavity having an open front adapted to receive a drawer frame. The cavity bottom wall is provided with one or more heating elements, whereby the module walls conduct heat to heat the cavity. A temperature thermostat is mounted on the undersurface of the cavity bottom wall to sense cavity temperature and is further connected to a thermostatic controller that controls the heating elements in accordance with a desired temperature.</p>
    <p>The warming systems described above suffer from several disadvantages. In particular, ovens typically do not have a high degree of accuracy or control, thereby enabling use of items having temperatures incompatible with a medical procedure and possibly causing injury to a patient. Further, the Burdick et al and Bishop warmers employ heaters that generally contact a particular portion of an article being heated, thereby heating articles in an uneven manner and enabling formation of hot spots. Moreover, the Burdick et al, Bishop, Corrigan, III et al and Van Overloop warming systems heat items simultaneously to only a single desired temperature rendering them incompatible for applications requiring various items to be heated to different temperature ranges. These systems further employ a heating element covering a substantial portion of a conducting member, thereby increasing system costs and power usage. The above described systems typically have heating area dimensions specifically configured to accommodate particular items and, therefore, are limited with respect to the types of items that may be heated by those systems. The Koopman system employs heating elements disposed within a housing cavity and not in direct contact with the surface supporting an item. This typically requires the system to heat the cavity, thereby providing increased heating time for an item to attain a particular temperature. In addition, the above-described warming systems do not provide a selectively configurable structure for partitioning system compartments to facilitate a relatively even heat distribution for additional or varying items placed therein.</p>
    <p>The present invention overcomes the aforementioned problems and provides several advantages. For example, the present invention warming system distributes heat evenly to one or more medical items of varying shapes and sizes, thereby ensuring relatively uniform heating of items with enhanced temperature control. Further, since medical items are supported within system compartments on a heating plate, the medical items are not in direct contact with a heater, thereby avoiding creation of “hot spots”. Moreover, the present invention reduces costs by utilizing a single common controller to simultaneously control each heater within system compartments, and provides versatility since each compartment heater may be individually controlled to enable the system to heat medical items contained within different compartments to the same or different desired temperatures. In addition, a warming system rack structure of the present invention provides even heat distribution and enhanced temperature regulation of individual medical items contained within the receptacles. Since most hospital personnel are unaware of the temperature of a particular medical item prior to use, the rack structure provides a fairly high degree of control of that temperature.</p>
    <heading>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to heat a medical item to a desired temperature by uniformly distributing heat about the medical item, thereby avoiding creation of “hot spots” and “cold spots”.</p>
    <p>It is another object of the present invention to simultaneously maintain various items at different desired temperatures for use in medical procedures.</p>
    <p>Yet another object of the present invention is to simultaneously maintain various items at different desired temperatures for use in medical procedures via a temperature control system including heating compartments individually controlled by a common controller, wherein each heating compartment is maintained at a desired temperature.</p>
    <p>Still another object of the present invention is to evenly distribute heat about a medical item within a heating compartment of the system by conducting heat through a heating plate that at least partially surrounds the medical item.</p>
    <p>A further object of the present invention is to provide a collapsible rack structure within a system heating compartment to partition that compartment and facilitate a uniform distribution of heat to additional or varying items.</p>
    <p>The aforesaid objects may be achieved individually and in combination, and it is not intended that the present invention be construed as requiring two or more of the objects to be combined unless expressly required by the claims attached hereto.</p>
    <p>According to the present invention, a temperature control system includes a cabinet or system housing having an interior partitioned into individual heating compartments for containing medical items. Each compartment includes a heating assembly having a generally U-shaped heating plate with thermally conductive bottom and side walls, a heater, a temperature sensor and a temperature cut-out switch. The heater is typically disposed beneath the bottom wall of the heating plate and applies heat to the heating plate to heat medical items placed thereon. The U-shaped configuration of the heating plate ensures even distribution of heat applied to one or more medical items placed within the heating compartment. The system further includes a controller in communication with the heater and temperature sensor of each heating assembly, wherein the controller controls heating of each compartment based upon a user selected desired or set point temperature associated with that compartment. A collapsible rack structure may additionally be disposed within one or more compartments to form individual receptacles in those compartments for receiving and heating medical items placed therein.</p>
    <p>The above and still further objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of specific embodiments thereof, particularly when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals in the various figures are utilized to designate like components.</p>

The door may include an opening covered by a substantially transparent material, such as glass or plexiglass, to serve as a window to enable viewing of the medical items and maintain heat within the cabinet. The door, opening and transparent material may be of any size or shape.</p>
    <p>An exemplary configuration for cabinet <b>504</b> <i>a </i>is illustrated in FIG. <b>2</b>. Specifically, cabinet <b>504</b> <i>a </i>includes a body <b>530</b>, top and bottom walls <b>510</b>, <b>512</b>, shelf <b>506</b> and door <b>528</b>. Body <b>530</b> includes rear wall <b>520</b> interconnected to side walls <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, thereby collectively defining compartment interiors. Rear wall <b>520</b> includes a substantially rectangular opening <b>538</b> defined in an upper portion thereof to permit air to cool circuitry contained within the cabinet upper portion as described below. Side walls <b>514</b>, <b>516</b> each include a ledge <b>546</b>, <b>548</b> defined at a side wall front edge. Ledges <b>546</b>, <b>548</b> extend inwardly and substantially perpendicular to the respective side walls, and enhance interconnection of cabinet components.</p>
    <p>A substantially rectangular cover <b>532</b> is disposed within and attached to the body slightly below the rear and side wall top edges to define a ceiling of upper compartment <b>524</b>. Top wall <b>510</b> is placed over and attached to the top edges of the rear and side walls with front wall <b>518</b> extending down from the top wall front edge to the cover. The front wall includes appropriate openings <b>540</b>, <b>542</b>, <b>544</b> for receiving the controller, power switch, and fuse respectively. The cover and top, side, front and rear walls collectively define a chamber above compartment <b>524</b> for housing the system control circuitry described below. Opening <b>538</b> within rear wall <b>520</b> permits air to enter the chamber to cool the circuitry. The opening may be of any quantity, shape or size, and may be defined at any locations within the rear, side and front walls.</p>
    <p>Shelf <b>506</b> is inserted within and attached to an intermediate section of the body to form compartments <b>524</b>, <b>526</b> within the cabinet interior. The shelf may include multiple holes to enhance dissipation of heat within the cabinet. Door <b>528</b> includes substantially rectangular members <b>534</b>, <b>536</b> each having openings defined therein for attachment of a handle (not shown). The door is attached to side wall <b>516</b> via conventional hinge mechanisms and typically pivots toward and away from the cabinet to permit access to the cabinet interior. The various cabinet components (e.g., walls, cover, shelf, door, etc.) may be of any shape or size, and may be constructed of any suitably sturdy materials. The components may be interconnected by any conventional or other fastening techniques, such as welding, molding or bending, fasteners (e.g., screws, bolts, nuts, etc.).</p>
    <p>Heating assemblies <b>508</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>508</b>(<b>2</b>) are each disposed within a corresponding cabinet compartment to heat medical items placed therein as described above. Each heating assembly includes an exemplary configuration as illustrated in FIG. <b>3</b>. Specifically, heating assemblies <b>508</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>508</b>(<b>2</b>) each include a heating plate <b>549</b> having a heater <b>558</b>, a temperature sensor <b>560</b> and temperature cut-out switch <b>562</b>. The heating plate protects the heater from medical items (e.g., containers melting and becoming attached to the heater), and includes a thermally conductive bottom wall <b>550</b> and thermally conductive side walls <b>552</b>, <b>554</b>. The bottom and side walls are each generally rectangular with the side walls extending from opposing bottom wall edges and forming rounded junctions where the side wall and bottom walls meet. The side walls extend upward from the opposing bottom walls edges and generally along walls of a corresponding compartment to form a generally U-shaped heating plate configuration. The bottom wall is generally flat for receiving and containing medical items thereon and extends along the bottom of a corresponding compartment. Legs <b>556</b> are attached to the underside of bottom wall <b>550</b> with each leg disposed toward a corresponding bottom wall corner. The legs elevate the heating plate above the corresponding compartment bottom (e.g., shelf <b>506</b> for compartment <b>524</b>, or bottom wall <b>512</b> for compartment <b>526</b>) to prevent the heater from contacting the cabinet. The legs may be of any quantity, shape or size, and may be disposed at any suitable locations. The front portion of bottom wall <b>550</b> includes a substantially rectangular protective panel <b>564</b> extending down from a front edge of the heating plate bottom wall. The protective panel prevents users from gaining access to the heater, thereby preventing user injury.</p>
    <p>Heater <b>558</b> and associated assembly components are typically disposed on the underside of bottom wall <b>550</b> as illustrated in FIG. <b>4</b>. Specifically, heater <b>558</b> is disposed on the underside of the bottom wall and applies heat to the heating plate. The heat applied by the heater is conducted by the heating plate bottom and side walls to provide an even heat distribution to the medical items residing on the heating plate, thereby preventing localized heating of the medical items. Further, since the medical items are not in direct contact with the heater, this arrangement avoids creation of “hot spots”. Alternatively, the heater may be disposed at any locations on the side or bottom walls of the heating plate.</p>
    <p>The heater is preferably configured to cover only a portion of the heating plate bottom wall, and is generally rectangular having truncated corners and a generally rectangular opening <b>565</b>. The heater is preferably implemented by a conventional etched foil silicon rubber heating pad, while a connector (not shown) facilitates connections for the heater. The heater further includes a pressure sensitive or other type of adhesive for attachment to the heating plate bottom wall. The heater may be of any quantity (e.g., at least one), shape, or size, and may include any configuration that covers the entirety or a portion of a corresponding heating plate bottom wall (e.g., strips, bars, segments, include various openings, etc.). In addition, the heater may be implemented by any conventional or other type of heater or heating element (e.g., heating coils) to heat the heating plate.</p>
    <p>Temperature sensor <b>560</b> is typically disposed on the underside of the heating plate bottom wall, generally within the confines of the heater (e.g., the portion of the heater not covering the bottom wall). The temperature sensor is preferably implemented by a conventional RTD temperature sensor (e.g., 1,000 Ohm RTD) and measures the temperature of the heating plate bottom wall. However, the temperature sensor may be implemented by any conventional or other type of temperature sensor, and may be disposed at any suitable location on the heating plate or within a compartment, thereby obviating the need for an internally mounted temperature sensor on the heating element. The temperature measurement of sensor <b>560</b> is provided to the controller for control of the heater as described below. In addition, a temperature sensitive cut-out switch <b>562</b> is disposed on bottom wall <b>550</b> within the confines of the heater. The cut-out switch basically disables current to heater <b>558</b> in response to a temperature measurement exceeding a temperature threshold. In other words, the cut-out switch disables the heater in response to detection of excessive heater temperatures. The cut-out switch may be implemented by any conventional switching type or limiting devices, such as a high limit thermostat, and may be disposed at any suitable locations.</p>
    <p>Referring back to FIG. 1, controller <b>522</b> typically includes a display <b>574</b> (e.g., LED or LCD), and a plurality of input devices or buttons <b>576</b> for enabling entry of desired or set point temperatures for the corresponding compartments. The input devices are manipulated to enable entry of the set point temperatures, while display <b>574</b> may indicate the actual temperature of each heating plate bottom wall measured by a corresponding temperature sensor <b>560</b> (FIG. 4) or the set point temperatures entered by the operator. Display <b>574</b> typically displays the measured temperature of each heating plate, and may be directed, via the input devices, to display the set point temperatures.</p>
    <p>The heating plates of each compartment are typically heated to the same temperature, but the temperatures may be different depending upon the medical items to be heated. Since the quantity or types of medical items placed in each compartment may differ, separate heating controls for the compartments are required. Accordingly, controller <b>522</b> provides independent control for each heating assembly and essentially implements a feedback control loop to control heating of those compartments. Specifically, controller <b>522</b> includes inputs for receiving temperature signals from temperature sensor <b>560</b> of each heating assembly indicating the temperature of a corresponding heating plate bottom wall. In response to the measured temperature of a heating plate bottom wall being equal to or exceeding the set point temperature entered for a corresponding compartment, the controller disables power to the heater associated with that compartment via a solid state relay described below. Conversely, when the measured temperature of the heating plate bottom wall is below the set point temperature entered for the corresponding compartment, the controller enables power to the heater associated with that compartment via the solid state relay. The controller is generally pre-programmed with a fuzzy logic or other type of control algorithm to control each heating assembly based on the measured temperature of the corresponding heating plate bottom wall. Controller <b>522</b> is preferably implemented by a 32A Series Temperature/Process Controller manufactured by Love Controls, a Division of Dwyer Instruments, Inc. Generally, this type of controller provides single set point capability for a process, or dual set point capability (e.g., dependent high and low set points) for the same process, and displays the set point and actual or process temperatures. However, in order to employ this type of controller within the present invention, the 32A Series Controller has been slightly modified. In particular, the alarm relay and associated circuits of the 32A Series Controller have been removed to permit insertion of loop circuitry, thereby enabling independent operation of plural set points. Further, the 32A Series Controller has been modified to display the actual temperature of each heating plate, while the set point temperatures entered for the compartments may be displayed by manipulating input devices <b>576</b>. In addition, the options typically available for the 32A Series Controller have not been enabled. It is to be understood that controller <b>522</b> may be implemented by any conventional or other processor or circuitry utilizing any control algorithm to control the heating assemblies, whereby controller <b>522</b> or other processor or circuitry may accommodate any quantity of heaters, compartments or set points.</p>
    <p>An exemplary control circuit of the temperature controlled cabinet system is illustrated in FIG. <b>5</b>. Specifically, system control circuit <b>577</b> includes power conductors <b>580</b>, <b>582</b>, power switch <b>523</b>, controller <b>522</b> and solid state relays <b>588</b>, <b>589</b>. The solid state relays are each associated with a corresponding heater <b>558</b> of heating assemblies <b>508</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>508</b>(<b>2</b>). Power conductors <b>580</b>, <b>582</b> enable power to the circuit with conductor <b>580</b> typically supplying a positive potential, while conductor <b>582</b> provides a negative or reference potential. Fuse <b>584</b> is connected in series with conductor <b>580</b> to prevent power surges from damaging the circuitry. Power switch <b>523</b> is connected to conductor <b>580</b> and in series with fuse <b>584</b>, and may include a light <b>581</b> to illuminate the switch. The power switch is further connected to conductor <b>582</b> and controller <b>522</b> to enable power to the controller.</p>
    <p>Controller <b>522</b> receives power from power switch <b>523</b> and is further connected to solid state relays <b>588</b>, <b>589</b> and temperature sensor <b>560</b> and heater <b>558</b> of each heating assembly <b>508</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>508</b>(<b>2</b>). Temperature sensor <b>560</b> of each heating assembly measures temperature of a corresponding heating plate bottom wall and transmits a signal to controller <b>522</b> indicating that temperature. The controller controls each solid state relay <b>588</b>, <b>589</b> to enable or disable power to a corresponding heater <b>558</b> in response to the temperature measured for the associated heating plate as described above. The solid state relays are each connected to controller <b>522</b> and a terminal block <b>568</b> disposed between the power switch and controller, between the controller and solid state relays, and between the controller and heater of each heating assembly <b>508</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>508</b>(<b>2</b>). The terminal block receives wiring from the solid state relays, power switch, controller and each heating assembly heater and facilitates connections between the wiring. Fuses <b>586</b>, <b>587</b> are respectively connected between solid state relays <b>588</b>, <b>589</b> and the terminal block to prevent damage to the relays and corresponding heaters.</p>
    <p>Temperature cut-out switch <b>562</b> of each heating assembly is connected between a heater <b>558</b> of that heating assembly and a corresponding solid state relay. The cut-out switch disables current to a corresponding heater in response to detecting the heater temperature in excess of a predetermined temperature threshold. Control circuit <b>577</b> may be implemented by any conventional circuitry components performing the above described functions.</p>
    <p>Operation of the temperature controlled cabinet system is described with reference to FIGS. 1 and 5. Initially, an operator selects medical solution containers (e.g., bags or bottles containing saline or intravenous (IV) solutions, antibiotics or other drugs, blood, etc.) or other medical items (e.g., instruments) for heating within the cabinet and determines appropriate temperatures for the items. The operator subsequently enables power switch <b>523</b>, whereby the operator grasps and applies force to the door handle to pivot the door outward from the cabinet interior to an open position. The medical items are disposed on any quantity (e.g., at least one) or combination of heating assemblies <b>508</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>508</b>(<b>2</b>) within the compartments. The door is subsequently pivoted towards the cabinet to a closed position. The desired or set point temperatures are entered into controller <b>522</b> via input devices or buttons <b>576</b>. The controller receives signals from the temperature sensor of each heating assembly and determines appropriate controls for a corresponding solid state relay <b>588</b>, <b>589</b> to enable or disable power to an associated heater as described above. Each heater <b>558</b> applies heat to a corresponding heating plate bottom wall, whereby the side walls of that heating plate conduct heat from the bottom wall to evenly distribute the heat to the medical items contained therein as described above.</p>
    <p>Controller <b>522</b> displays the heating plate bottom wall temperature of each heating assembly measured by a corresponding temperature sensor <b>560</b>, and may be further directed to alternatively display the set point temperature entered for the compartments based on manipulation of input devices <b>576</b>. When the medical items have attained the desired temperatures, the door is pivoted to an open position as described above, whereby the heated medical items are removed from the compartments for use, while the door is subsequently returned to a closed position. Further, additional medical items may replace the removed items within the compartments for heating by the system. The medical items may be loaded into the system several hours before the items are required for use (e.g., the items may be placed within the system the night prior to use in a medical procedure) so that the items, such as intravenous (IV) solution bags, may attain their operational temperature and be available for immediate use by the required time. It is to be understood that either or both of the compartments may be used and independently controlled in substantially the same manner described above to maintain medical items at the same or different desired temperatures. Moreover, any quantity of items may be disposed within the compartments for heating by the cabinet.</p>
    <p>An alternative configuration for cabinet <b>504</b> <i>a </i>is illustrated in FIG. <b>6</b>. Cabinet <b>504</b> <i>b </i>is substantially similar to cabinet <b>504</b> <i>a </i>described above except that cabinet <b>504</b> <i>b </i>includes a chamber on its top surface for housing system control circuitry. Specifically, cabinet <b>504</b> <i>b </i>is generally in the form of a rectangular box having a raised chamber defined on its top surface. The cabinet includes front door <b>528</b>, cover <b>532</b>, front panel <b>595</b>, bottom and rear walls <b>512</b>, <b>590</b>, side walls <b>594</b>, <b>596</b> and top panel <b>592</b>. The cabinet front door, cover and bottom wall are each as described above, while the cabinet front door, cover and bottom and side walls collectively define the cabinet interior. Shelf <b>506</b> is disposed within the cabinet interior at an intermediate cabinet section to partition the cabinet interior into upper and lower compartments <b>524</b>, <b>526</b> as described above. Each compartment includes a respective heating assembly <b>508</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>508</b>(<b>2</b>) for receiving and heating medical items placed thereon in substantially the same manner described above.</p>
    <p>Front panel <b>595</b> is substantially rectangular and is attached to and extends upward from an intermediate section of cover <b>532</b>. The front panel is tilted slightly rearward and has a longer dimension similar to the transverse dimension of cover <b>532</b>. Rear wall <b>590</b> is substantially rectangular and is attached to side walls <b>594</b>, <b>596</b>, cover <b>532</b> and bottom wall <b>512</b>. The rear wall extends from the bottom wall toward the upper edge of front panel <b>595</b>. Top panel <b>592</b> is substantially rectangular and is attached to and disposed between the upper edges of the front panel and rear wall. Side walls <b>594</b>, <b>596</b> are generally rectangular and are attached to and extend between the bottom wall and cover. The side walls partially extend beyond the cover for attachment to top panel <b>592</b>, and are further attached to and disposed between the front panel and rear wall. The top panel, front panel, cover and side and rear walls collectively define a chamber on the cover top surface to house the system circuitry. Front panel <b>595</b> further includes controller <b>522</b> disposed toward a front panel central portion and power switch <b>523</b> disposed toward a front panel upper edge near side wall <b>594</b>. Fuse <b>584</b> (not shown) is typically disposed on rear wall <b>590</b>. System <b>502</b> <i>b </i>functions in substantially the same manner described above for system <b>502</b> <i>a </i>to heat items placed therein.</p>
    <p>In addition, the cabinet systems described above may further include a collapsible rack structure disposed within the cabinet compartments to contain items as illustrated, by way of example only, in FIGS. 7<i>a</i>-<b>7</b> <i>b</i>. System <b>502</b> <i>c </i>is substantially similar to system <b>502</b> <i>a </i>described above for FIGS. 1-5, and further includes a collapsible rack structure. Specifically, compartments <b>524</b>, <b>526</b> each include a series of supports <b>527</b>, <b>537</b> disposed on the interior surface of rear wall <b>520</b>. The supports are substantially rectangular having a narrow transverse or shorter dimension to essentially form ledges within each compartment protruding from the rear wall. The supports extend substantially in parallel and are vertically spaced from each other a slight distance.</p>
    <p>Upper leaves <b>525</b>, <b>529</b> are disposed within each compartment <b>524</b>, <b>526</b> and are attached to side walls <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, respectively, with a corresponding support <b>527</b> disposed between those leaves. Similarly, lower leaves <b>535</b>, <b>539</b> are disposed within each compartment <b>524</b>,<b>526</b> and are attached to side walls <b>514</b>,<b>516</b>, respectively, below leaves <b>525</b>, <b>529</b> with a corresponding support <b>537</b> disposed between the lower leaves. Each upper and lower leaf includes a pair of substantially rectangular board members attached to each other by a hinge type mechanism, thereby permitting each leaf to be folded and placed against the cabinet side wall.</p>
    <p>Each compartment <b>524</b>, <b>526</b> includes a divider bar <b>517</b> and a bar holder <b>547</b>. Bar holder <b>547</b> may be implemented by any conventional or other securing or clasping mechanism and secures the bar within each compartment. Bar holder <b>547</b> within compartment <b>524</b> is attached to the underside of cover <b>532</b>, while the bar holder within compartment <b>526</b> is attached to the underside of shelf <b>506</b>. However, the bar holders may be of any quantity, shape or size, and may be disposed in any suitable locations. Bar <b>517</b> includes a plurality of hinged sections that enable the bar to expand and collapse or fold for storage within a corresponding bar holder (FIG. 7<i>a</i>). Bar <b>517</b> includes a narrow transverse or shorter dimension, and is attached to a corresponding holder within each compartment <b>524</b>, <b>526</b>. When in an expanded state, the bar extends down from a corresponding holder within a compartment toward the front of the cabinet. The bar essentially provides a vertical divider toward the front portion of each compartment that is generally perpendicular to the unfolded leaves, and the bar includes ledges (not shown) disposed coincident supports <b>527</b>, <b>537</b> within that compartment. The bar ledges and rear wall supports within a compartment provide support for the upper and lower leaves of that compartment, thereby forming individual receptacles. Heating assemblies <b>508</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>508</b>(<b>2</b>) are respectively disposed on the shelf and bottom wall within compartments <b>524</b>, <b>526</b> to heat medical items placed in the compartments as described above. The side walls of each heating plate typically extend from the heating plate bottom wall to a point slightly below respective supports <b>537</b> and lower leaves <b>535</b>, <b>539</b> to enable the rack structure to accommodate the heating assemblies. Alternatively, the upper and lower leaves within a compartment may be connected to the side walls of the heating plate of a corresponding heating assembly to form the rack structure.</p>
    <p>The rack structure may be utilized within a compartment by extending bar <b>517</b> down from holder <b>547</b>. The bar ledges and rear wall supports provide support for the distal portions of the upper and lower leaves as described above. Each upper and lower leaf may be unfolded and placed on a corresponding rear wall support and bar ledge to form individual receptacles within the compartment. Medical items may be placed in one or more of the receptacles for heating. The rack structure provides an even heat distribution from the heating assembly to the individual medical items placed within the receptacles. A convective flow of heat is developed around the medical items supported in the rack structure, and the system may further include a fan to enhance this flow and provide forced air convection. In order to collapse the rack, the upper and lower leaves are folded and placed against the compartment side walls, while the bar is collapsed and placed in the bar holder.</p>
    <p>Any portion of the rack structure may be utilized within a compartment to heat medical items. For example, the bar and upper and lower leaves within a compartment may remain in their collapsed states, and medical items may be placed on the heating assembly for heating as described above (e.g., compartment <b>524</b> as shown in FIG. 7<i>a</i>). Conversely, a bar may be extended within a compartment with each upper and lower leaf of that compartment unfolded to form several receptacles for heating items (e.g., compartment <b>524</b> as shown in FIG. 7<i>b</i>). In addition, a bar may be extended within a compartment with some of the upper and lower leaves of that compartment unfolded to form receptacles to heat items, while additional items may be placed on the heating assembly for heating as described above (e.g., compartment <b>526</b> as shown in FIGS. 7<i>a</i>-<b>7</b> <i>b</i>). Any portion of the rack structure within any compartment may be expanded for use as described above. The rack structure components (e.g., supports, leaves, bar, bar holder, etc.) may be of any shape or size, and may be constructed of any suitable materials (e.g., conductive or non-conductive materials, such as plastic coated wiring, metal bars or rods, etc.). The rack structure may include any quantity of components (e.g., supports, leaves, bars, bar holders, etc.) of any shape or size to partition a compartment into any quantity of receptacles. The receptacles may be of any shape or size and may contain any quantity of medical items. In addition, the rack structure may be utilized in any of the cabinet systems described above, and may be implemented by any structures or devices partitioning compartment interiors into individual receptacles. For example, a pre-formed rack may be placed within the compartments to contain medical items for heating.</p>
