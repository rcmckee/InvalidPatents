The lace extends through a series of guide members positioned along two opposing footwear closure portions. The lace and guides preferably have low friction surfaces to facilitate sliding of the lace along the guide members so that the lace evenly distributes tension across the footwear member. The tightening mechanism allows incremental adjustment of the tension of the lace. A release mechanism allows a user to quickly loosen the lace. A safety mechanism inhibits unintentional and/or accidental loosing of the lace.</div>

    <p num="p-0003">The present invention relates to footwear. More particularly, the present invention relates to a low-friction lacing system that provides equilibrated tightening pressure across a wearer's foot for sports boots and shoes.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0004">There currently exists a number of mechanisms and methods for tightening a shoe or boot around a wearer's foot. A traditional method comprises threading a lace in a zig-zag pattern through eyelets that run in two parallel rows attached to opposite sides of the shoe. The shoe is tightened by first tensioning opposite ends of the threaded lace to pull the two rows of eyelets towards the midline of the foot and then tying the ends in a knot to maintain the tension. A number of drawbacks are associated with this type of lacing system. First, laces do not adequately distribute the tightening force along the length of the threaded zone, due to friction between the lace and the eyelets, so that portions of the lace are slack and other portions are in tension. Consequently, the higher tensioned portions of the shoe are tighter around certain sections of the foot, particularly the ankle portions which are closer to the ends. This is uncomfortable and can adversely affect performance in some sports.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">Another drawback associated with conventional laces is that it is often difficult to untighten or redistribute tension on the lace, as the wearer must loosen the lace from each of the many eyelets through which the laces are threaded. The lace is not easily released by simply untightening the knot. The friction between the lace and the eyelets often maintains the toe portions and sometimes much of the foot in tension even when the knot is released. Consequently, the user must often loosen the lace individually from each of the eyelets. This is especially tedious if the number of eyelets is high, such as in ice-skating boots or other specialized high performance footwear.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">Another tightening mechanism comprises buckles which clamp together to tighten the shoe around the wearer's foot. Typically, three to four or more buckles are positioned over the upper portion of the shoe. The buckles may be quickly clamped together and drawn apart to tighten and loosen the shoe around the wearer's foot. Although buckles may be easily and quickly tightened and untightened, they also have certain drawbacks. Specifically, buckles isolate the closure pressure across three or four points along the wearer's foot corresponding to the locations of the buckles. This is undesirable in many circumstances, such as for the use of sport boots where the wearer desires a force line that is evenly distributed along the length of the foot. Another drawback of buckles is that they are typically only useful for hard plastic or other rigid material boots. Buckles are not as practical for use with softer boots, such as ice skates or snowboard boots.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">There is therefore a need for a tightening system for footwear that does not suffer from the aforementioned drawbacks. Such a system should automatically distribute lateral tightening forces along the length of the wearer's ankle and foot. The tightness of the shoe should desirably be easy to loosen and incrementally adjust. The tightening system should close tightly and should not loosen up with continued use.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0008">There is provided in accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a footwear lacing system. The system comprises a footwear member including first and second opposing sides configured to fit around a foot. A plurality of lace guide members are positioned on the opposing sides. A lace is guided by the guide members, the lace being rotationally connected to a spool that is rotatable in a winding direction and an unwinding direction. A tightening mechanism is attached to the footwear member, and coupled to the spool, the tightening mechanism including a control for winding the lace around the spool to place tension on the lace thereby pulling the opposing sides towards each other. A safety device is moveable between a secure position in which the spool is unable to rotate in an unwinding direction, and a releasing position in which the spool is free to rotate in an unwinding direction.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">In one embodiment, the lace is slideably positioned around the guide members to provide a dynamic fit in response to movement of the foot within the footwear. The guide members may have a substantially C-shaped cross section.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">Additionally, the tightening mechanism is a rotatable reel that is configured to receive the lace. In accordance with one embodiment, a knob rotates the spool and thereby winds the lace about the spool. In some embodiments, rotating the knob in an unwinding direction releases the spool and allows the lace to unwind. A safety device can be attached, such as a lever, that selectively allows the knob to rotate in an unwinding direction to release the spool. Alternatively, the safety device can be a rotatable release that is rotated separately from the knob to release the spool.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">In certain embodiments, the footwear lacing system is attached to footwear having a first opposing side configured to extend from one side of the shoe, across the upper midline of the shoe, and to the opposing side of the shoe. As such, the reel can be mounted to the first opposing side.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">In one embodiment, the lace is formed of a polymeric fiber.</p>
    <p num="p-0013">According to another aspect of the footwear lacing system, a closure system for footwear having an upper with a lateral side and a medial side, the closure system comprising at least a first lace guide attached to the lateral side of the upper, at least a second lace guide attached to the medial side of the upper, and each of the first and second lace guides comprising a lace pathway, a lace slideably extending along the lace pathway of each of the first and second lace guides. Additionally, a tightening reel of the footwear for retracting the lace and thereby advancing the first lace guide towards the second lace guide to tighten the footwear is positioned on the footwear, and a lock is moveable between a coupled position and an uncoupled position wherein the lock allows the reel to be only rotatable in a forward direction when the lock is engaged, and allows the reel to be rotatable in a reverse direction when the lock is disengaged.</p>
    <p num="p-0014">An embodiment also includes a closed loop lace wherein the lace is permanently mounted in the reel. Accordingly, each of the at least first and second lace guides comprise an open channel to receive the closed loop lace.</p>
    <p num="p-0015">According to another embodiment of the footwear lacing system, a spool and lace unit is provided for use in conjunction with a footwear lacing system comprises a spool having ratchet teeth disposed on its periphery configured to interact with a pawl for inhibiting relative rotation of the spool in at least one direction, and a lace securely attached to the spool. Optionally, the lace can be formed of a lubricious polymer having a relatively low elasticity and high tensile strength. Alternatively, the lace can be formed of a multi-strand polymeric cable.</p>

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p num="p-0070">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is disclosed one embodiment of a sport boot <b>20</b> prepared in accordance with the present invention. The sport boot <b>20</b> generally comprises an ice skating or other action sport boot which is tightened around a wearer's foot using a lacing system <b>22</b>. The lacing system <b>22</b> includes a lace <b>23</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) that is threaded through the boot <b>20</b> and attached at opposite ends to a tightening mechanism <b>25</b>, as described in detail below. As used herein, the terms lace and cable have the same meaning unless specified otherwise. The lace <b>23</b> is a low friction lace that slides easily through the boot <b>20</b> and automatically equilibrates tightening of the boot <b>20</b> over the length of the lacing zone, which generally extends along the ankle and foot. Although the present invention will be described with reference to an ice skating boot, it is to be understood that the principles discussed herein are readily applicable to any of a wide variety of footwear, and are particularly applicable to sports shoes or boots suitable for snow boarding, roller skating, skiing and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0071">The boot <b>20</b> includes an upper <b>24</b> comprising a toe portion <b>26</b>, a heel portion <b>28</b>, and an ankle portion <b>29</b> that surrounds the wearer's ankle. An instep portion <b>30</b> of the upper <b>24</b> is interposed between the toe portion <b>26</b> and the ankle portion <b>29</b>. The instep portion <b>30</b> is configured to fit around the upper part of the arch of the medial side of the wearer's foot between the ankle and the toes. A blade <b>31</b> (shown in phantom lines) extends downward from the bottom of the boot <b>20</b> in an ice-skating embodiment.</p>
    <p num="p-0072"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a front elevational view of the boot <b>20</b>. As shown, the top of the boot <b>20</b> generally comprises two opposed closure edges or flaps <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> that partially cover a tongue <b>36</b>. Generally, the lace <b>23</b> may be tensioned to draw the flaps <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> toward each other and tighten the boot <b>20</b> around the foot, as described in detail below. Although the inner edges of the flaps <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> are shown separated by a distance, it is understood that the flaps <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> could also be sized to overlap each other when the boot <b>20</b> is tightened, such as is known with ski footwear. Thus, references herein to drawing opposing sides of footwear towards each other refers to the portion of the footwear on the sides of the foot. This reference is thus generic to footwear in which opposing edges remain spaced apart even when tight (e.g. tennis shoes) and footwear in which opposing edges may overlap when tight (e.g. certain snow skiing boots). In both, tightening is accomplished by drawing opposing sides of the footwear towards each other.</p>
    <p num="p-0073">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the tongue <b>36</b> extends rearwardly from the toe portion <b>26</b> toward the ankle portion <b>29</b> of the boot <b>20</b>. Preferably, the tongue <b>36</b> is provided with a low friction top surface <b>37</b> to facilitate sliding of the flaps <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> and lace <b>23</b> over the surface of the tongue <b>32</b> when the lace <b>23</b> is tightened. The low friction surface <b>37</b> may be formed integrally with the tongue <b>32</b> or applied thereto such as by adhesives, heat bonding, stitching or the like. In one embodiment, the surface <b>37</b> is formed by adhering a flexible layer of nylon or polytetrafluoroethylene to the top surface of the tongue <b>36</b>. The tongue <b>36</b> is preferably manufactured of a soft material, such as leather.</p>
    <p num="p-0074">The upper <b>24</b> may be manufactured from any from a wide variety of materials known to those skilled in the art. In the case of a snow board boot, the upper <b>24</b> is preferably manufactured from a soft leather material that conforms to the shape of the wearer's foot. For other types of boots or shoes, the upper <b>24</b> may be manufactured of a hard or soft plastic. It is also contemplated that the upper <b>24</b> could be manufactured from any of a variety of other known materials.</p>
    <p num="p-0075">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the lace <b>23</b> is threaded in a crossing pattern along the midline of the foot between two generally parallel rows of side retaining members <b>40</b> located on the flaps <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the side retaining members <b>40</b> each consist of a strip of material looped around the top and bottom edges of the flaps <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> so as to define a space in which guides <b>50</b> are positioned. The lace <b>23</b> slides through the guides <b>50</b> during tightening and untightening of the lace <b>23</b>, as described more fully below. In the illustrated embodiment, there are three side retaining members <b>40</b> on each flap <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> although the number of retaining members <b>40</b> may vary. In some embodiments, four, five or six or more retaining members <b>40</b> may be desirable on each side of the boot.</p>
    <p num="p-0076">In certain boot designs, it may be possible during the tightening process for an opposing pair of lace guides to “bottom out” and come in contact with each other before that portion of the boot is suitably tightened. Further tightening of the system will not produce further tightening at that point. Rather, other portions of the boot which may already be sized appropriately would continue to tighten. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the side retaining members <b>40</b> each consist of a strip of material looped around the guides <b>50</b>. Additional adjustability may be achieved by providing a releasable attachment between the side retaining members <b>40</b> and the corresponding flap <b>32</b> or <b>34</b> of the shoe. In this manner, the side retaining member <b>40</b> may be moved laterally away from the midline of the foot to increase the distance between opposing lace guides.</p>
    <p num="p-0077">One embodiment of the adjustable side retaining member <b>40</b> may be readily constructed, that will appear similar to the structure disclosed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In the adjustable embodiment, a first end of the strip of material is attached to the corresponding flap <b>32</b> or <b>34</b> using conventional means such as rivets, stitching, adhesives, or others known in the art. The strip of material loops around the guide <b>50</b>, and is folded back over the outside of the corresponding flap <b>32</b> or <b>34</b> as illustrated. Rather than stitching the top end of the strip of material to the flap, the corresponding surfaces between the strip of material and the flap may be provided with a releasable engagement structure such as hook and loop structures (e.g., Velcro®), or other releasable engagement locks or clamps which permits lateral-medial adjustability of the position of the guide <b>50</b> with respect to the edge of the corresponding flap <b>32</b> or <b>34</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0078">The guides <b>50</b> may be attached to the flaps <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> or to other spaced apart portions of the shoe through any of a variety of manners, as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein. For example, the retaining members <b>40</b> can be deleted and the guide <b>50</b> sewn directly onto the surface of the flap <b>32</b> or <b>34</b> or opposing sides of the upper. Stitching the guide <b>50</b> directly to the flap <b>32</b> or <b>34</b> may advantageously permit optimal control over the force distribution along the length of the guide <b>50</b>. For example, when the lace <b>23</b> is under relatively high levels of tension, the guide <b>50</b> may tend to want to bend and to possibly even kink near the curved transition in between longitudinal portion <b>51</b> and transverse portion <b>53</b> as will be discussed. Bending of the guide member under tension may increase friction between the guide member and the lace <b>23</b>, and, severe bending or kinking of the guide member <b>50</b> may undesirably interfere with the intended operation of the lacing system. Thus, the attachment mechanism for attaching the guide member <b>50</b> to the shoe preferably provides sufficient support of the guide member to resist bending and/or kinking. Sufficient support is particularly desirable on the inside radius of any curved portions particularly near the ends of the guide member <b>50</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0079">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the lace <b>23</b> also extends around the ankle portion <b>29</b> through a pair of upper retaining members <b>44</b> <i>a </i>and <b>44</b> <i>b </i>located on the ankle portion <b>29</b>. The upper retaining members <b>44</b> <i>a </i>and <b>44</b> <i>b </i>each comprise a strip of material having a partially raised central portion that defines a space between the retaining members <b>44</b> and the upper <b>24</b>. An upper guide member <b>52</b> extends through each of the spaces for guiding the lace <b>23</b> around either side of the ankle portion <b>29</b> to the tightening mechanism <b>25</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0080"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic perspective view of the lacing system <b>22</b> of the boot <b>20</b>. As shown, each of the side and top guide members <b>50</b> and <b>52</b>, has a tube-like configuration having a central lumen <b>54</b>. Each lumen <b>54</b> has an inside diameter that is larger than the outside diameter of the lace <b>23</b> to facilitate sliding of the lace <b>23</b> through the side and top guide members <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> and prevent binding of the lace <b>23</b> during tightening and untightening. In one embodiment, the inside diameter of the lumen is approximately 0.040 inches, to cooperate with a lace having an outside diameter of about 0.027″. However, it will be appreciated that the diameter of the lumen <b>54</b> can be varied to fit specific desired lace dimensions and other design considerations. The wall thickness and composition of the guides <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> may be varied to take into account the physical requirements imposed by particular shoe designs.</p>
    <p num="p-0081">Thus, although the guides <b>50</b> are illustrated as relatively thin walled tubular structures, any of a variety of guide structures may be utilized as will be apparent to those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein. For example, either permanent (stitched, glued, etc.) or user removable (Velcro, etc.) flaps <b>40</b> may be utilized to hold down any of a variety of guide structures. In one embodiment, the guide <b>50</b> is a molded block having a lumen extending therethrough. This may take a form similar to that illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, <b>4</b>B or <b>6</b>. Modifications of the forgoing may also be accomplished, such as by extending the length of the lace pathway in a structure such as that illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, such that the overall part has a shallow “U” shaped configuration which allows it to be conveniently retained by the retention structure <b>40</b>. Providing a guide member <b>50</b> having increased structural integrity over that which would be achieved by the thin tube illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may be advantageous in embodiments of the invention where the opposing guides <b>50</b> may be tightened sufficiently to “bottom out” against the opposing corresponding guide, as will be apparent to those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein. Solid and relatively harder lace guides as described above may be utilized throughout the boot, but may be particularly useful in the lower (e.g. toe) portion of the boot.</p>
    <p num="p-0082">In general, each of the guide members <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> defines a pair of openings <b>49</b> that communicate with opposite ends of the lumen <b>54</b>. The openings <b>49</b> function as inlets/outlets for the lace <b>23</b>. The openings desirably are at least as wide as the cross-section of the lumen <b>54</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0083">As may be best seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each top guide <b>52</b> has an end <b>55</b> which is spaced apart from a corresponding side guide <b>50</b> on the opposing side of the footwear, with the lace <b>23</b> extending therebetween. As the system is tightened, the spacing distance will be reduced. For some products, the wearer may prefer to tighten the toe or foot portion more than the ankle. This can be conveniently accomplished by limiting the ability of the side guide <b>50</b> and top guide <b>52</b> to move towards each other beyond a preselected minimum distance during the tightening process. For this purpose, a selection of spacers having an assortment of lengths may be provided with each system. The spacers may be snapped over the section of lace <b>23</b> between a corresponding end <b>55</b> of top guide <b>52</b> and side guide <b>50</b>. When the ankle portion of the boot is sufficiently tight, yet the wearer would like to additionally tighten the toe or foot portion of the boot, a spacer having the appropriate length may be positioned on the lace <b>23</b> in-between the top guide <b>52</b> and side guide <b>50</b>. Further tightening of the system will thus not be able to draw the top guide <b>52</b> and corresponding side guide <b>50</b> any closer together.</p>
    <p num="p-0084">The stop may be constructed in any of a variety of ways, such that it may be removably positioned between the top guide <b>52</b> and side guide <b>50</b> to limit relative tightening movement. In one embodiment, the stop comprises a tubular sleeve having an axial slot extending through the wall, along the length thereof. The tubular sleeve may be positioned on the boot by advancing the slot over the lace <b>23</b>, as will be apparent to those of skill in the art. A selection of lengths may be provided, such as ½ inch, 1 inch, -1½ inch, and every half inch increment, on up to 3 or 4 inches or more, depending upon the position of the reel on the boot and other design features of a particular embodiment of the boot. Increments of ¼ inch may also be utilized, if desired.</p>
    <p num="p-0085">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the top guide <b>52</b> is illustrated for simplicity as unattached to the corresponding side flap <b>32</b>. However, in an actual product, the top guide <b>52</b> is preferable secured to the side flap <b>32</b>. For example, upper retaining member <b>44</b> <i>a</i>, discussed above, is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Alternatively, the top guide <b>52</b> may extend within the material of or between the layers of the side flap <b>32</b>. As a further alternative, or in addition to the foregoing, the end <b>55</b> of top guide <b>52</b> may be anchored to the side flap <b>32</b> using any of a variety of tie down or clamping structures. One suitable structure is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> <i>a</i>, discussed below. The lace <b>23</b> may be slideably positioned within a tubular sleeve extending between the reel and the tie down at the end <b>55</b> of the sleeve.</p>
    <p num="p-0086">Any of a variety of flexible tubular sleeves may be utilized, such as a spring coil with or without a polymeric jacket similar to that used currently on bicycle brake and shift cables. The use of a flexible but axially noncompressible sleeve for surrounding the lace <b>23</b> between the reel and the tie down at the end <b>55</b> isolates the tightening system from movement of portions of the boot, which may include hinges or flexibility points as is understood in the art. The tie down may comprise any of a variety of structures in addition to that illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref>, including grommets, rivets, staples, stitched or adhesively bonded eyelets, as will be apparent to those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0087">In the illustrated embodiment, the side guide members <b>50</b> each have a generally U-shape that opens towards the midline of the shoe. Preferably, each of the side guide members <b>50</b> comprise a longitudinal portion <b>51</b> and two inclined or transverse portions <b>53</b> extending therefrom. The length of the longitudinal portion <b>51</b> may be varied to adjust the distribution of the closing pressure that the lace <b>23</b> applies to the upper <b>24</b> when the lace <b>23</b> is under tension. In addition, the length of the longitudinal portion <b>51</b> need not be the same for all guide members <b>50</b> on a particular shoe. For example, the longitudinal portion <b>51</b> may be shortened near the ankle portion <b>29</b> to increase the closing pressure that the lace <b>23</b> applies to the ankles of the wearer. In general, the length of the longitudinal portion <b>51</b> will fall within the range of from about ½″ to about 3″, and, in some embodiments, within the range of from about ¼″ to about 4″. In one snowboard application, the longitudinal portion <b>51</b> had a length of about 2″. The length of the transverse portion <b>53</b> is generally within the range of from about ⅛″ to about 1″. In one snowboard embodiment, the length of transverse portion <b>53</b> was about ½″. Different specific length combinations can be readily optimized for a particular boot design through routine experimentation by one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0088">In between the longitudinal portion <b>51</b> and transverse portion <b>53</b> is a curved transition. Preferably, the transition has a substantially uniform radius throughout, or smooth progressive curve without any abrupt edges or sharp changes in radius. This construction provides a smooth surface over which the lace <b>23</b> can slide, as it rounds the corner. The transverse section <b>53</b> can in some embodiments be deleted, as long as a rounded cornering surface is provided to facilitate sliding of the lace <b>23</b>. In an embodiment which has a transverse section <b>53</b> and a radiused transition, with a guide member <b>50</b> having an outside diameter of 0.090″ and a lace <b>23</b> having an outside diameter of 0.027″, the radius of the transition is preferably greater than about 0.1″, and generally within the range of from about 0.125″ to about 0.4″.</p>
    <p num="p-0089">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the upper guide members <b>52</b> extend substantially around opposite sides of the ankle portion <b>29</b>. Each upper guide member <b>52</b> has a proximal end <b>56</b> and a distal end <b>55</b>. The distal ends <b>55</b> are positioned near the top of the tongue <b>36</b> for receipt of the lace <b>23</b> from the uppermost side guide members <b>50</b>. The proximal ends <b>56</b> are coupled to the tightening mechanism <b>25</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the proximal ends <b>56</b> include rectangular coupling mounts <b>57</b> that engage with the tightening mechanism <b>25</b> for feeding the ends of the lace <b>23</b> therein, as described more fully below. The guide members <b>50</b> and/or <b>52</b> are preferably manufactured of a low friction material, such as a lubricous polymer or metal, that facilitates the slideability of the lace <b>23</b> therethrough. Alternatively, the guides <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> can be made from any convenient substantially rigid material, and then be provided with a lubricous coating on at least the inside surface of lumen <b>54</b> to enhance slideability. The guide members <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> are preferably substantially rigid to prevent bending and kinking of the guide members <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> and/or the lace <b>23</b> within any of the guide members <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> as the lace <b>23</b> is tightened. The guide members <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> may be manufactured from straight tube of material that is cold bent or heated and bent to a desired shape.</p>
    <p num="p-0090">Alternatively, the guide members <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> may be constructed in a manner that permits bending, retains a low friction surface, yet resist kinking. For example, guide members <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> may comprise a spring coil, either with the spring coil exposed or the spring coil provided with a polymeric coating on the inside surface or outside surface or both. The provision of a spring coil guide satisfies the need for lateral flexibility in some embodiments, yet retains a hard interior surface which help to minimize friction between the guide and the lace.</p>
    <p num="p-0091">As an alternate guide member <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> design which increases lateral flexibility yet retains a hard interior lace contacting surface, the guide <b>50</b> may comprise a plurality of coaxially-aligned segments of a hard polymeric or metal tube material. Thus, a plurality of tubing segments, each segment having an axial length within the range of from about 0.1″ to about 1.0″, and preferably about 0.25″ or less can be coaxially aligned, either in end-to-end contact or axially spaced apart along the length of the guide <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>. Adjacent tubular segments can be maintained in a coaxial relationship such as by the provision of an outer flexible polymeric jacket. The shape of the tubular guide may be retained such as by stitching the guide onto the side of the shoe in the desired orientation, or through other techniques which will be apparent to those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0092">As an alternative to the previously described tubular guide members, the guide members <b>50</b> and/or <b>52</b> comprise an open channel having, for example, a semicircular or “U” shaped cross section. The guide channel is preferably mounted on the boot such that the channel opening faces away from the midline of the boot, so that a lace under tension will be retained therein. One or more retention strips, stitches or flaps may be provided for “closing” the open side of the channel, to prevent the lace from escaping when tension on the lace is released. The axial length of the channel can be preformed in a generally U configuration like the illustrated tubular embodiment, and may be continuous or segmented as described in connection with the tubular embodiment.</p>
    <p num="p-0093">Several guide channels may be molded as a single piece, such as several guide channels molded to a common backing support strip which can be adhered or stitched to the shoe. Thus, a right lace retainer strip and a left lace retainer strip can be secured to opposing portions of the top or sides of the shoe to provide a right set of guide channels and a left set of guide channels.</p>
    <p num="p-0094">As an alternative to the previously described tubular guide members, the guide members <b>50</b> and/or <b>52</b> comprise a multi-piece guide member <b>199</b> comprised of a first member <b>200</b> and a second member <b>202</b> that mates thereto, such as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. The first member <b>200</b> and the second member <b>202</b> each have a thin, flat shape. A cavity or seat <b>204</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) extends into an upper surface of the first member <b>200</b>. The seat <b>204</b> is preferably sized to receive the second member <b>202</b> snug therein, such as in a press-fit fashion, as best shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0095">As shown in the cross-sectional view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the second member <b>202</b> may be positioned within the seat so that a gap <b>206</b> of predetermined shape is defined between the second member <b>202</b> and the first member <b>200</b>. A pair of apertures <b>207</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref>, <b>4</b>B) are located on one of the first or second member <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> to serve as entryways into the gap <b>206</b>. The apertures <b>207</b> preferably are sufficiently large to allow passage of the lace <b>23</b> therethrough. In one embodiment, the apertures <b>207</b> are within the range of from about 0.030 inches to about 0.060 inches in diameter.</p>
    <p num="p-0096">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the gap <b>206</b> is elongated so that it defines a lace pathway that functions as the lumen <b>54</b> for the lace <b>23</b>. The lumen <b>54</b> preferably includes an elongate region <b>209</b> that extends generally lengthwise along the edges of the flaps <b>32</b> or <b>34</b> when the guide member <b>199</b> is mounted on the boot. The elongate region <b>209</b> may be straight or may be defined by a smooth curve along the length thereof, such as a continuous portion of a circle or ellipse. As an example, the elongate region <b>209</b> may be defined by a portion of an ellipse having a major axis of about 0.5 inches to about 2 inches and a minor axis of about 0.25 inches to about 1.5 inches. In one embodiment, the major axis is approximately 1.4 inches and the minor axis is about 0.5 inches. The lumen <b>54</b> further includes a transverse region <b>210</b> on opposite ends of the elongate region <b>209</b>. The transverse region <b>210</b> extends at an incline to the edges of the flaps <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>. Alternatively, the elongate region <b>209</b> and the transverse region <b>210</b> may be merged into one region having a continuous circular or elliptical profile to spread load evenly along the length of the lumen <b>54</b> and thereby reduce total friction in the system.</p>
    <p num="p-0097">The first and second members <b>200</b>, <b>202</b> of the multi-piece guide member <b>199</b> may be manufactured of a low friction material, such as a lubricous polymer or metal, that facilitates the slideability of the lace <b>23</b> therethrough. Alternatively, the guide member <b>199</b> can be made from any convenient substantially rigid material, and then be provided with a lubricous coating on at least the surface of the inside curve of lumen <b>54</b> to enhance slideability. The guide member <b>199</b> may be substantially rigid to prevent bending and kinking of the guide member <b>199</b> and/or the lace <b>23</b> therein as the lace <b>23</b> is tightened. The guide member <b>199</b> may alternatively be made of a flexible material when used in portions of the shoe that are subject to bending. The guide members <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> may be manufactured through known molding processes.</p>
    <p num="p-0098">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, each of the guide members <b>199</b> has a predetermined distance between the first opening <b>207</b> <i>a </i>and second opening <b>207</b> <i>b </i>to the lace pathway therein. The effective linear distance between the first and second openings to the lace pathway may affect the fit of the boot. An embodiment in which the distance between the first opening <b>207</b> <i>a </i>and second opening <b>207</b> <i>b </i>is adjustable is illustrated schematically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>. Any of a wide variety of other implementations may be readily devised, which incorporate the function of the structure schematically illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0099">In general, a first guide element <b>211</b> is spaced apart from a second guide element <b>213</b>. The first guide element <b>211</b> contains a first partial or complete aperture <b>207</b> <i>a </i>for receiving lace <b>23</b> therethrough. The second guide element <b>213</b> includes the second partial or complete aperture <b>207</b> <i>b</i>, also for receiving the lace <b>23</b> therethrough. As is the case with other embodiments herein, the lace pathway (not illustrated) through the first and second guide elements <b>211</b> and <b>213</b> may extend through a tunnel or may extend along a curved surface, such as a rotatable pulley, radiused recess or otherwise depending upon the desired performance and construction.</p>
    <p num="p-0100">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, the lace <b>23</b> enters the first aperture <b>207</b> <i>a</i>, extends through the first guide element <b>211</b>, and into the second guide element <b>213</b>. The adjustable guide member <b>199</b> is additionally provided with a threaded shaft <b>215</b> extending between the first and second guide elements <b>211</b> and <b>213</b>. Rotation of the threaded shaft <b>215</b> in a first direction draws the guide elements <b>211</b> and <b>213</b> towards each other, thereby shortening the distance between the lace apertures <b>207</b> <i>a </i>and <b>207</b> <i>b</i>. Rotating the threaded shaft <b>215</b> in an opposite direction increases the axial distance between apertures <b>207</b> <i>a </i>and <b>207</b> <i>b</i>. Specific rotational engagements between the threaded shaft <b>215</b>, guide elements <b>211</b> and <b>213</b>, to accomplish this purpose are well known in the art. A rotatable engagement structure, such as a slotted head, a hex recess or projection, or the like may be provided on one end <b>217</b> of the threaded shaft <b>215</b>. Any of a variety of alternate structures may be utilized, to permit the adjustment of the spacing between the apertures <b>207</b> <i>a </i>and <b>207</b> <i>b</i>, as will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0101">The lace <b>23</b> may be formed from any of a wide variety of polymeric or metal materials or combinations thereof, which exhibit sufficient axial strength and bendability for the present application. For example, any of a wide variety of solid core wires, solid core polymers, or multi-filament wires or polymers, which may be woven, braided, twisted or otherwise oriented can be used. A solid or multi-filament metal core can be provided with a polymeric coating, such as PTFE or others known in the art, to reduce friction. In one embodiment, the lace <b>23</b> comprises a stranded cable, such as a <b>7</b> strand by <b>7</b> strand cable manufactured of stainless steel. In order to reduce friction between the lace <b>23</b> and the guide members <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> through which the lace <b>23</b> slides, the outer surface of the lace <b>23</b> is preferably coated with a lubricous material, such as nylon or Teflon. In a preferred embodiment, the diameter of the lace <b>23</b> ranges from 0.024 inches to 0.060 inches and is preferably 0.027 inches. The lace <b>23</b> is desirably strong enough to withstand loads of at least 40 pounds and preferably at least about 90 pounds. In certain embodiments the lace is rated at least about 100 pounds up to as high as 200 pounds or more. A lace <b>23</b> of at least five feet in length is suitable for most footwear sizes, although smaller or larger lengths could be used depending upon the lacing system design.</p>
    <p num="p-0102">The lace <b>23</b> may be formed by cutting a piece of cable to the desired length. If the lace <b>23</b> comprises a braided or stranded cable, there may be a tendency for the individual strands to separate at the ends or tips of the lace <b>23</b>, thereby making it difficult to thread the lace <b>23</b> through the openings in the guide members <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>. As the lace <b>23</b> is fed through the guide members, the strands of the lace <b>23</b> easily catch on the curved surfaces within the lace guide members. The use of a metallic lace, in which the ends of the strands are typically extremely sharp, also increases the likelihood of the cable catching on the guide members during threading. As the tips of the strands catch on the guide members and/or the tightening mechanism, the strands separate, making it difficult or impossible for the user to continue to thread the lace <b>23</b> through the tiny holes in the guide members and/or the tightening mechanism. Unfortunately, unstranding of the cable is a problem unique to the present replaceable-lace system, where the user may be required to periodically thread the lace through the lace guide members and into the corresponding tightening mechanism.</p>
    <p num="p-0103">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, one solution to this problem is to provide the tips or ends <b>59</b> of the lace <b>23</b> with a sealed or bonded region <b>61</b> wherein the individual strands are retained together to prevent separation of the strands from one another. For clarity of illustration, the bonded region <b>61</b> is shown having an elongate length. However, the bonded region <b>61</b> may also be a bead located at just the extreme tip of the lace <b>23</b> and, in one embodiment, could be a bonded tip surface as short as 0.002 inch or less.</p>
    <p num="p-0104">The bonded region <b>61</b> may be formed, for example, by applying a weld (e.g., solder tip, brazing, welding, or melting the strands together) to the ends <b>59</b> during formation of the lace <b>23</b> to thereby hold the strands together and prevent separation of the strands. A tip weld advantageously does not significantly increase the overall diameter of the lace <b>23</b>. Additionally, the weld may also be used to smooth the ends <b>59</b> of the lace <b>23</b> to facilitate insertion of the lace <b>23</b> into the guide members. A weld is also advantageous in that it provides a secure, permanent bond between the strands of the lace <b>23</b>. The bonded region <b>61</b> provides the ends of the lace <b>23</b> with a smooth and secure surface that greatly facilitates threading of the lace through the guide members and into the tightening mechanism. The bonded region thus makes it much easier for a user to replace the lace <b>23</b> in the system. Alternatively, adhesives or thin walled shrink wrap tubing may be used in certain embodiments.</p>
    <p num="p-0105">After the 7×7 multistrand stainless steel cable described above has been tightened and untightened a number of times, the cable tends to kink or take a set. Kink resistance of the cable may be improved by making the cable out of a nickel titanium alloy such as nitinol. Other materials may provide desirable kink resistance, as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein. In one particular embodiment, a 1×7 multi-strand cable may be constructed having seven nitinol strands, each with a diameter within the range of from about 0.005 inches to about 0.015 inches woven together. In one embodiment, the strand has a diameter of about 0.010 inches, and a 1×7 cable made with that strand has an OD of about 0.030 inches. The diameter of the nitinol strands may be larger than a corresponding stainless steel embodiment due to the increased flexibility of nitinol, and a 1×7 construction and in certain embodiments a 1×3 construction may be utilized.</p>
    <p num="p-0106">In a 1×3 construction, three strands of nitinol, each having a diameter within the range of from about 0.007 inches to about 0.025 inches, preferably about 0.015 inches are drawn and then swaged to smooth the outside. A drawn multistrand cable will have a nonround cross-section, and swaging and/or drawing makes the cross-section approximately round. Swaging and/or drawing also closes the interior space between the strands, and improves the crush resistance of the cable. Any of a variety of additives or coatings may also be utilized, such as additives to fill the interstitial space between the strands and also to add lubricity to the cable. Additives such as adhesives may help hold the strands together as well as improve the crush resistance of the cable. Suitable coatings include, among others, PTFE, as will be understood in the art.</p>
    <p num="p-0107">In an alternate construction, the lace or cable comprises a single strand element. In one application, a single strand of a nickel titanium alloy wire such as nitinol is utilized. Advantages of the single strand nitinol wire include both the physical properties of nitinol, as well as a smooth outside diameter which reduces friction through the system. In addition, durability of the single strand wire may exceed that of a multi strand since the single strand wire does not crush and good tensile strength or load bearing capacity can be achieved using a small OD single strand wire compared to a multi strand braided cable. Compared to other metals and alloys, nitinol alloys are extremely flexible. This is useful since the nitinol laces are able to navigate fairly tight radii curves in the lace guides and also in the small reel. Stainless steel or other materials tend to kink or take a set if a single strand was used, so those materials are generally most useful in the form of a stranded cable. However, stranded cables have the disadvantage that they can crush in the spool when the lace is wound on top of itself. In addition, the stranded cables are not as strong for a given diameter as a monofilament wire because of the spaces in between the strands. Strand packing patterns in multistrand wire and the resulting interstitial spaces are well understood in the art. For a given amount of tensile strength, the multistrand cables therefore present a larger bulk than a single filament wire. Since the reel is preferably minimized in size the strongest lace for a given diameter is preferred. In addition, the stranded texture of multistrand wires create more friction in the lace guides and in the spool. The smooth exterior surface of a single strand creates a lower friction environment, better facilitating tightening, loosening and load distribution in the dynamic fit of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0108">Single strand nitinol wires having diameters within the range of from about 0.020 inches to about 0.040 inches may be utilized, depending upon the boot design and intended performance. In general, diameters which are too small may lack sufficient load capacity and diameters which are too large may lack sufficient flexibility to be conveniently threaded through the system. The optimal diameter can be determined for a given lacing system design through routine experimentation by those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein. In many boot embodiments, single strand nitinol wire having a diameter within the range of from about 0.025 inches to about 0.035 inches may be desirable. In one embodiment, single strand wire having a diameter of about 0.030 inches is utilized.</p>
    <p num="p-0109">The lace may be made from wire stock, shear cut or otherwise severed to the appropriate length. In the case of shear cutting, a sharpened end may result. This sharpened end is preferably removed such as by deburring, grinding, and/or adding a solder ball or other technique for producing a blunt tip. In one embodiment, the wire is ground or coined into a tapered configuration over a length of from about ½ inch to about 4 inches and, in one embodiment, no more than about 2 inches. The terminal ball or anchor is preferably also provided as discussed below. Tapering the end of the nitinol wire facilitates feeding the wire through the lace guides and into the spool due to the increased lateral flexibility of the reduced cross section.</p>
    <p num="p-0110">Provision of an enlarged cross sectional area structure at the end of the wire, such as by welding, swaging, coining operations or the use of a melt or solder ball, may be desirable in helping to retain the lace end within the reel as well as facilitating feeding the lace end through the lace guides and into the reel. In one embodiment of the reel, discussed elsewhere herein, the lace end is retained within the reel under compression by a set screw. While set screws may provide sufficient retention in the case of a multi strand wire, set screw compression on a single stand cable may not produce sufficient retention force because of the relative crush resistance of the single strand. The use of a solder ball or other enlarged cross sectional area structure at the end of the lace can provide an interference fit behind the set screw, to assist retention within the reel.</p>
    <p num="p-0111">In one example, a 0.030 inch diameter single strand lace is provided with a terminal ball having a diameter within the range of from about 0.035 inches to about 0.040 inches. In addition to or as an alternative to the terminal ball or anchor, a slight angle or curve may be provided in the tip of the lace. This angle may be within the range of from about 5° to about 25°, and, in one embodiment about 15°. The angle includes approximately the distal ⅛ inch of the lace. This construction allows the lace to follow tight curves better, and may be combined with a rounded or blunted distal end which may assist navigation and locking within the reel. In one example, a single strand wire having a diameter of about 0.030 inches is provided with a terminal anchor having a diameter of at least about 0.035 inches. Just proximal to the anchor, the lace is ground to a diameter of about 0.020 inches, which tapers over a distance of about an inch in the proximal direction up to the full 0.030 inches. Although the term “diameter” is utilized to describe the terminal anchor, Applicant contemplates nonround anchors such that a true diameter is not present. In a noncircular cross-section embodiment, the closest approximation of the diameter is utilized for the present purposes.</p>
    <p num="p-0112">As an alternative terminal anchor on the lace, a molded piece of plastic or other material may be provided on the end of each single strand. In a further variation, each cable end is provided with a detachable threading guide. The threading guide may be made from any of a variety of relatively stiff plastics like nylon, and be tapered to be easily travel around the corners of the lace guides. After the lace is threaded through the lace guides, the threading guide may be removed from the lace and discarded, and the lace may be then installed into the reel.</p>
    <p num="p-0113">The terminal anchor on the lace may also be configured to interfit with any of a variety of connectors on the reel. Although set screws are a convenient mode of connection, the reel may be provided with a releasable mechanism to releasably receive the larger shaped end of the lace which snaps into place and is not removable from the reel unless it is released by an affirmative effort such as the release of a lock or a lateral movement of the lace within a channel. Any of a variety of releasable interference fits may be utilized between the lace and the reel, as will be apparent to those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0114">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the tightening mechanism <b>25</b> is mounted to the rear of the upper <b>24</b> by fasteners <b>64</b>. Although the tightening mechanism <b>25</b> is shown mounted to the rear of the boot <b>20</b>, it is understood that the tightening mechanism <b>25</b> could be located at any of a wide variety of locations on the boot <b>20</b>. In the case of an ice skating boot, the tightening mechanism is preferably positioned over a top portion of the tongue <b>36</b>. The tightening mechanism <b>25</b> may alternatively be located on the bottom of the heal of the boot, on the medial or the lateral sides of the upper or sole, as well as anywhere along the midline of the shoe facing forward or upward. Location of the tightening mechanism <b>25</b> may be optimized in view of a variety of considerations, such as overall boot design as well as the intended use of the boot. The shape and overall volume of the tightening mechanism <b>25</b> can be varied widely, depending upon the gear train design, and the desired end use and location on the boot. A relatively low profile tightening mechanism <b>25</b> is generally preferred. The mounted profile of the tightening mechanism <b>25</b> can be further reduced by recessing the tightening mechanism <b>25</b> into the wall or tongue of the boot. Boots for many applications have a relatively thick wall, such as due to structural support and/or thermal insulation and comfort requirements. The tightening mechanism may be recessed into the wall of the boot by as much as ¾″ or more in some locations and for some boots, or on the order of about ⅛″ or ½″ for other location and/or other boots, without adversely impacting the comfort and functionality of the boot.</p>
    <p num="p-0115">In general, the tightening mechanism <b>25</b> comprises a control such as a lever, crank or knob, which can be manipulated to retract lace <b>23</b> therein. In addition, the tightening mechanism preferably comprises a release such as a button or lever, for disengaging the tightening mechanism to permit the lace <b>23</b> to be withdrawn freely therefrom.</p>
    <p num="p-0116">The tightening mechanism <b>25</b> in the illustrated embodiment generally comprises a rectangular housing <b>60</b> and a circular knob <b>62</b> rotatably mounted thereto. The knob <b>62</b> may be rotated to wind the ends of the lace <b>23</b> into the housing <b>60</b> and thereby tension the lace <b>23</b> to reduce slack. As the slack in the lace <b>23</b> reduces, the lace <b>23</b> pulls the side guide members <b>50</b>, and thereby the flaps <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>, toward the midline of the boot to tighten the upper <b>24</b> around a foot.</p>
    <p num="p-0117">The tightening mechanism <b>25</b> advantageously includes an internal gear mechanism to allow the wearer to easily turn the knob <b>62</b> to retract the lace <b>23</b>. Preferably, the gear mechanism is configured to incrementally pull and retain a predetermined length of lace as the knob <b>62</b> is rotated, as described in detail below. A user may thus advantageously continuously adjust the tension in the lace <b>23</b> to a desired comfort and performance level. The knob <b>62</b> may be rotated either manually or through the use of a tool or small motor attached to the knob <b>62</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0118">Any of a variety of known mechanical structures can be utilized to permit winding of the spool to increase tension on the lace, yet resist unwinding of the spool until desired. For example, any of a wide variety of ratchet structures can be used for this purpose. Alternatively, a Sprague clutch or similar structure will permit one-way rotation of a shaft while resisting rotation in the opposite direction. These and other structures will be well known to those of ordinary skill in the mechanical arts.</p>
    <p num="p-0119">A release lever <b>63</b> is located along a side of the housing <b>60</b>. The release lever may be rotated to disengage the internal gear mechanism to release tension in the lace <b>23</b> and loosen the upper <b>23</b> around the wearer's foot, as described in detail below. This advantageously allows a user to quickly and easily untighten the lacing system by simply turning the release lever <b>63</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0120">The low friction relationship between the lace <b>23</b> and cable guides <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> greatly facilitate tightening and untightening of the lacing system <b>20</b>. Specifically, because the lace <b>23</b> and cable guides <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> are manufactured or coated with a low friction material, the lace <b>23</b> slides easily through the cable guides without catching. The lace <b>23</b> thus automatically distributes the tension across its entire length so that tightening pressure is evenly distributed along the length of the ankle and foot. When the tension in the lace <b>23</b> is released by actuating the release lever, the lace <b>23</b> slides easily through the cable guides <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> to release tension and evenly distribute any slack among the length of the lace. The low friction tongue <b>36</b> also facilitates moving of the flaps <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> away from each other when the lace <b>23</b> is loosened.</p>
    <p num="p-0121"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an exploded perspective view of the various components of one embodiment of the tightening mechanism <b>25</b>. As shown, the housing <b>60</b> consists of a pair of interlocking halves <b>64</b> <i>a </i>and <b>64</b> <i>b </i>that are mated to each other using fasteners <b>66</b>, such as screws. The housing <b>60</b> encloses a gear mechanism <b>70</b> that preferably rotatably fits within cavities <b>65</b> in the inner surfaces of the halves <b>64</b> <i>a </i>and <b>64</b> <i>b</i>. In the illustrated embodiment, the gear mechanism <b>70</b> comprises first, second, and third gear wheels <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, and <b>76</b>, respectively, that rotatably engage with each other when the tightening mechanisms <b>25</b> is assembled.</p>
    <p num="p-0122">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the first gear wheel <b>72</b> includes a shaft <b>78</b> about which the first gear wheel rotates. A first portion of the shaft <b>78</b> extends through an aperture in the housing halve <b>64</b> <i>a</i>. A second portion of the shaft <b>78</b> extends through an aperture in the halve <b>64</b> <i>b</i>. The knob <b>62</b> mounts to the shaft <b>78</b> through a mounting hole <b>80</b> in the knob <b>0</b>.<b>62</b>. A mounting pin <b>76</b> removably secures the knob <b>62</b> to the shaft <b>78</b> in a well known manner. When the tightening mechanism <b>25</b> is assembled, rotation of the knob <b>62</b> causes the first gear wheel <b>72</b> to also rotate. Actuation of the gear mechanism <b>70</b> is thus accomplished through rotation of the knob <b>62</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0123">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the first gear wheel <b>72</b> also includes a ratchet section <b>82</b> having a plurality of sloped teeth <b>83</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) positioned circumferentially around the axis of the first gear wheel <b>72</b>. The sloped teeth <b>83</b> are configured to mate with a pawl <b>84</b> to prevent undesired backward rotation of the first gear wheel <b>72</b>, as described more fully below. Toward this end, a biasing member <b>86</b> couples to a peg <b>90</b> that extends from the pawl <b>84</b>. The biasing member <b>86</b> biases the pawl <b>84</b> against the ratchet teeth when the gear mechanism <b>70</b> is assembled. The third gear wheel <b>72</b> also includes a gear section <b>92</b> having a series of gear teeth that extend around the periphery of the third gear wheel <b>72</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0124">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the second gear wheel <b>74</b> includes a first gear section <b>94</b> and a stepped second gear section <b>96</b> having a diameter smaller than the first gear section <b>94</b> on a common axis of rotation. The first gear section <b>94</b> has gear teeth that are configured to mesh with the gear section <b>92</b> of the first gear wheel <b>72</b>. An aperture <b>97</b> extends centrally through the second gear wheel <b>74</b>. The aperture <b>97</b> is sized to rotatably receive a post <b>98</b> that extends from the housing halve <b>64</b> <i>b</i>. The second gear wheel <b>74</b> rotates about the post <b>98</b> during actuation of the assembled gear mechanism <b>70</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0125">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the third gear wheel <b>76</b> includes a gear section <b>100</b> that is configured to mesh with the second gear section <b>96</b> of the second gear wheel <b>74</b>. The third gear wheel also includes a spool section <b>102</b> comprising grooves <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> that extend around the periphery of the third gear wheel <b>76</b>. The grooves <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> are sized to receive opposite ends of the lace <b>23</b> in a winding fashion during actuation of the gear mechanism <b>25</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0126">The ends <b>107</b> and <b>108</b> of the lace <b>23</b> are each provided with anchors <b>109</b> that mate with seating holes <b>110</b> in a press fit fashion. The seating holes <b>110</b> are diametrically positioned on the third gear wheel <b>76</b>. When the anchors <b>109</b> are mated with the seating holes <b>110</b>, the ends <b>107</b> and <b>108</b> of the lace <b>23</b> are separately positioned within the grooves <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>, respectively. The coupling mounts <b>57</b> fit into a corresponding aperture in the housing halve <b>64</b> to maintain the distal ends <b>56</b> of the guide member <b>50</b> in a fixed position relative to the tightening mechanism.</p>
    <p num="p-0127">Any of a variety of spool or reel designs can be utilized in the context of the present invention, as will be apparent to those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein. For example, only a single groove spool can be utilized. However, a dual groove spool or two side-by-side spools as illustrated has the advantage of permitting convenient simultaneous retraction of both lace ends <b>107</b> and <b>108</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, with ends <b>107</b> and <b>108</b> approaching the spool from opposite directions, the lace conveniently wraps around the spool in opposite directions using a single rotatable shaft as will be apparent from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0128">Depending upon the gearing ratio and desired performance, one end of the lace can be fixed to a guide or other portion of the boot and the other end is wound around the spool. Alternatively, both ends of the lace can be fixed to the boot, such as near the toe region and a middle section of the lace is attached to the spool.</p>
    <p num="p-0129">Preferably, the cavity <b>65</b> is toleranced to fit closely around the outer circumference of the spool, to capture the lace. Thus, the gap between the outer flange walls surrounding each groove and the interior surface of the cavity <b>65</b> are preferably smaller than the diameter of the lace. In this manner, the risk of tangling the lace within the winding mechanism can be minimized.</p>
    <p num="p-0130">Any of a variety of attachment structures for attaching the ends of the lace to the spool can be used. In addition to the illustrated embodiment, the lace may conveniently be attached to the spool by threading the lace through an aperture and providing a transversely oriented set screw so that the set screw can be tightened against the lace and to attach the lace to the spool. The use of set screws or other releasable clamping structures facilitates disassembly and reassembly of the device, and replacement of the lace as will be apparent to those of skill in the art.</p>
    <p num="p-0131">In any of the embodiments disclosed herein, the lace may be rotationally coupled to the spool either at the lace ends, or at a point on the lace that is spaced apart from the ends. In addition, the attachment may either be such that the user can remove the lace with or without special tools, or such that the user is not intended to be able to remove the lace from the spool. Although the device is disclosed primarily in the context of a design in which the lace ends are attached to the spool, the lace ends may alternatively be attached elsewhere on the footwear. In this design, an intermediate point on the lace is connected to the spool such as by adhesives, welding, interference fit or other attachment technique. In one design the lace extends through an aperture which extends through a portion of the spool, such that upon rotation of the spool, the lace is wound around the spool. The lace ends may also be attached to each other, to form a continuous lace loop.</p>
    <p num="p-0132">Rotation of the third gear wheel <b>76</b> causes the ends <b>107</b> and <b>108</b> of the lace <b>23</b> to wind around the grooves <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>, respectively, and thereby pull the length of the lace <b>23</b> into the tightening mechanism <b>25</b> and place the lace <b>23</b> in tension. It is understood that the ends <b>107</b>, <b>108</b> of the lace <b>23</b> wind around the spool section <b>102</b> at an equal rate so that tension is evenly applied to both ends of the lace <b>23</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0133">The third gear wheel includes a central aperture <b>111</b> sized to rotatably receive the shaft <b>78</b> on the first gear wheel <b>72</b>. The third gear wheel <b>76</b> rotates about the shaft <b>78</b> during actuation of the gear mechanism <b>70</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0134">In a preferred embodiment, the third gear wheel <b>76</b> has a diameter of 0.625 inches. The second gear section <b>96</b> of the second gear wheel <b>74</b> preferably has a diameter of approximately 0.31 inches and the first gear section preferably has a diameter approximately equal to the diameter of the third gear wheel <b>76</b>. The first gear wheel <b>72</b> preferably has a diameter of approximately 0.31 inches. Such a relationship in the gear sizes provides sufficiently small adjustments in the tension of the lace <b>23</b> as the gear wheels are turned.</p>
    <p num="p-0135"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of the assembled tightening mechanism <b>25</b>. As shown, the shaft <b>78</b> of the first gear wheel <b>72</b> is journaled within apertures <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> in the housing halves <b>64</b> <i>a </i>and <b>64</b> <i>b</i>, respectively. The knob <b>62</b> is mounted over the portion of the shaft <b>78</b> extending out of the halve <b>64</b> <i>a </i>through the aperture <b>112</b>. The first, second, and third gear wheels <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, and <b>76</b>, respectively are in meshed engagement with each other. Specifically, the gear section <b>92</b> of the first gear wheel <b>72</b> is in meshed engagement with the first gear section <b>94</b> on the second gear wheel. Likewise, the second gear section <b>96</b> on the second gear wheel <b>94</b> is in meshed engagement with the gear section <b>100</b> of the third gear wheel <b>76</b>. Accordingly, rotation of the knob <b>62</b> causes the first gear wheel <b>72</b> to rotate and thereby cause the second gear wheel to rotate in an opposite direction by means of the meshed engagement between the gear sections <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>. This in turn causes the third gear wheel <b>76</b> to rotate in the direction of knob rotation by means of the meshed engagement between the gear sections <b>96</b> and <b>100</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0136">As the third gear wheel <b>76</b> rotates, the ends <b>107</b> and <b>108</b> of the lace are wound within the grooves <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> respectively. Rotation of the knob <b>62</b> thus winds the lace <b>23</b> around the third gear wheel <b>76</b> to thereby tighten the boot <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0137">As illustrated, counterclockwise rotation (relative to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) of the knob <b>62</b> tightens the lace <b>23</b>. The tension in the lace <b>23</b> is maintained by means of a ratchet mechanism that is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0138"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the tightening mechanism <b>25</b> taken along the line <b>10</b>-<b>10</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. As shown, the biasing member <b>86</b> maintains the pawl <b>84</b> in locked engagement with the sloped teeth <b>83</b> on the ratchet section <b>82</b>. The pawl <b>84</b> thus inhibits clockwise rotation of the knob <b>62</b> and loosening of the lace <b>23</b>. It will be understood that the sloped teeth <b>83</b> do not inhibit counterclockwise rotation of the knob <b>62</b> because the pawl <b>84</b> slides over the teeth <b>83</b> when the knob <b>64</b> is rotated clockwise. As the knob <b>62</b> is rotated counterclockwise, the pawl <b>84</b> automatically engages each of the teeth <b>83</b> to advantageously allow the user to incrementally adjust the amount of lace <b>23</b> that is drawn into the tightening mechanism <b>25</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0139">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the release lever <b>63</b> communicates with the pawl <b>84</b> through a shaft <b>116</b> that extends through the housing <b>60</b>. A lower end of the shaft <b>116</b> is provided with a cam member <b>118</b>. The release lever <b>63</b> may be rotated about the shaft <b>116</b> to cause the cam member <b>118</b> to also rotate and push the pawl <b>84</b> away from engagement with the ratchet teeth <b>83</b>. When the pawl <b>84</b> disengages from the ratchet teeth, the first gear wheel <b>72</b>, and each of the other gear wheels <b>74</b> and <b>76</b>, are free to rotate.</p>
    <p num="p-0140">When the user actuates the release lever <b>63</b>, the tension, if any, in the lace <b>23</b> causes the lace <b>23</b> to automatically unwind from the spooling section <b>102</b>. The release lever <b>63</b> is thus used to quickly untighten the boot <b>20</b> from around the foot. It will be appreciated that the low friction relationship between the lace <b>23</b> and the guide members <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> facilitates sliding of the lace <b>23</b> within the guide members so that the lace untightens quickly and smoothly by simply turning the release lever <b>63</b> and then manually pulling the tongue <b>36</b> forward.</p>
    <p num="p-0141">It is contemplated that a limit on the expansion of portions of the boot due to the sliding of the lace <b>23</b> could be accomplished such as through one or more straps that extend transversely across the boot <b>20</b> at locations where an expansion limit or increased tightness or support are desired. For instance, a strap could extend across the instep portion <b>30</b> from one side of the boot <b>20</b> to another side of the boot. A second or lone strap could also extend around the ankle portion <b>29</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0142">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, an expansion limiting strap <b>220</b> is located on the ankle portion of the boot <b>20</b> to supplement the closure provided by the lace <b>23</b> and provide a customizable limit on expansion due to the dynamic fit achieved by the lacing system of the present invention. The limit strap <b>220</b> may also prevent or inhibit the wearer's foot from unintentionally exiting the boot <b>20</b> if the lace <b>20</b> is unlocked or severed or the reel fails. In the illustrated embodiment, the strap <b>220</b> extends around the ankle of the wearer. The location of the limit strap <b>220</b> can be varied depending upon boot design and the types of forces encountered by the boot in a particular athletic activity.</p>
    <p num="p-0143">For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the limit strap <b>220</b> defines an expansion limiting plane which extends generally horizontally and transverse to the wearer's ankle or lower leg. The inside diameter or cross section of the footwear thus cannot exceed a certain valve in the expansion limiting plane, despite forces imparted by the wearer and the otherwise dynamic fit. The illustrated location tends to limit the dynamic opening of the top of the boot as the wearer bends forward at the ankle. The function of the limit strap <b>220</b> may be accomplished by one or more straps, wires, laces or other structures which encircle the ankle, or which are coupled to other boot components such that the limit strap in combination with the adjacent boot components provide an expansion limiting plane. In one embodiment the expansion limiting strap surrounds the ankle as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The anterior aspect of the strap is provided with an aperture for receiving the reel assembly therethrough. This allows the use of the expansion limiting strap in an embodiment having a front mounted reel, and may be particularly useful where the reel is provided with a quick mount release such the bayonet mount described in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</figref>, discussed below.</p>
    <p num="p-0144">In an alternative design, the expansion limiting plane is positioned in a generally vertical orientation, such as by positioning the limit strap <b>220</b> across the top of the foot anterior of the ankle, to achieve a different limit on dynamic fit. In this location, the expansion limiting strap <b>220</b> may encircle the foot inside or outside of the adjacent shoe components, or may connect to the sole or other component of the shoe to provide the same net force effect as though the strap encircled the foot.</p>
    <p num="p-0145">The limit strap <b>220</b> may also create a force limiting plane which resides at an angle in between the vertical and horizontal embodiments discussed above, such as in an embodiment where the force limiting plane inclines upwardly from the posterior to the anterior within the range of from about 25° to about 75° from the plane on which the sole of the boot resides. Positioning the limit strap <b>220</b> along an inclined force limiting plane which extends approximately through the ankle can conveniently provide both a limit on upward movement of the foot within the boot, as well as provide a controllable limit on the anterior flexing of the leg at the ankle with respect to the boot.</p>
    <p num="p-0146">The strap <b>220</b> preferably includes a fastener <b>222</b> that could be used to adjust and maintain the tightness of the strap <b>220</b>. Preferably, the fastener <b>222</b> is capable of quick attachment and release, so that the wearer can adjust the limit strap <b>220</b> without complication. Any of a variety of fasteners such as corresponding hook and loop (e.g., Velcro) surfaces, snaps, clamps, cam locks, laces with knots and the like may be utilized, as will be apparent to those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0147">The strap <b>220</b> is particularly useful in the present low-friction system. Because the lace <b>23</b> slides easily through the guide members, the tension in the lace may suddenly release if the lace is severed or the reel fails. This would cause the boot to suddenly and completely open which could cause injury to the wearer of the boot, especially if they were involved in an active sport at the time of failure. This problem is not present in traditional lacing systems, where the relatively high friction in the lace, combined with the tendency of the lace to wedge with the traditional eyelets on the shoe, eliminates the possibility of the lace suddenly and completely loosening.</p>
    <p num="p-0148">The low-friction characteristics of the present system also provides the shoe with a dynamic fit around the wearer's foot. The wearer's foot tends to constantly move and change orientation during use, especially during active sports. This shifting causes the tongue and flaps of the shoe to shift in response to the movement of the foot. This is facilitated by the low-friction lacing system, which easily equilibrates the tension in the lace in response to shifting of the wearer's foot. The strap <b>220</b> allows the user to regulate the amount of dynamic fit provided by the boot by establishing an outer limit on the expansion which would otherwise have occurred due to the tension balancing automatically accomplished by the readjustment of the lace throughout the lace guide system.</p>
    <p num="p-0149">For example, if the wearer of the boot in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> did not have the ankle strap <b>220</b>, when he flexed his ankle forward during skating, the increased forward force at the top of the boot would cause the tongue to move out slightly while the laces lower in the boot would tighten. As the wearer straightened his ankle out again, closure force would equalize and the tongue would stay tight against his ankle. If the strap <b>220</b> were wrapped around his ankle however, it would prevent or reduce this forward movement of the ankle and tongue reducing the dynamic fit characteristics of the boot in the plane of the strap <b>220</b> and providing a very different fit and feel of the boot. Thus, the strap provides an effective means for regulating the amount of dynamic fit inherent in the low friction closure system. Since traditional lacing systems have so much friction in them, they do not provide this dynamic fit and consequently would not benefit from the strap in the same way.</p>
    <p num="p-0150">Similar straps are commonly used in conjunction with traditional lacing systems but for entirely different reasons. They are used to provide additional closure force and leverage to supplement shoelaces but are not needed for safety and are not used to regulate dynamic fit.</p>
    <p num="p-0151">The footwear lacing system <b>20</b> described herein advantageously allows a user to incrementally tighten the boot <b>20</b> around the user's foot. The low friction lace <b>23</b> combined with the low friction guide members <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> produce easy sliding of lace <b>23</b> within the guide members <b>50</b> and <b>52</b>. The low friction tongue <b>36</b> facilitates opening and closure of the flaps <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> as the lace is tightened. The lace <b>23</b> equilibrates tension along its length so that the lacing system <b>23</b> provides an even distribution of tightening pressure across the foot. The tightening pressure may be incrementally adjusted by turning the knob on the tightening mechanism <b>25</b>. A user may quickly untighten the boot <b>20</b> by simply turning the release lever <b>63</b> or lifting or pressing the knob or operating any alternative release mechanism to automatically release the lace <b>23</b> from the tightening mechanism <b>25</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0152">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, at least one anti-abrasion member <b>224</b> is disposed adjacent the tongue <b>36</b> and between the flaps <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. As best shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref>, the anti-abrasion member <b>224</b> comprises a flat disc-like structure having a pair of internal channels or lumen <b>127</b> <i>a,b </i>arranged in a crossing pattern so as to define a crossing point <b>230</b>. The lumen <b>127</b> <i>a,b </i>are sized to receive the lace <b>23</b> therethrough. As shown in the cross-sectional view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the lumen <b>127</b> <i>a,b </i>are arranged to prevent contact between adjacent sections of the lace <b>23</b> at the crossing point <b>230</b>. The anti-abrasion member <b>224</b> thereby prevents chafing of the lace <b>23</b> at the crossing point <b>230</b>. The anti-abrasion member <b>224</b> also shields the lace <b>23</b> from the tongue <b>36</b> to inhibit the lace <b>23</b> from chafing or abrading the tongue <b>36</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0153">The anti-abrasion member <b>224</b> may alternatively take the form of a knife edge or apex for minimizing the contact area between the lace <b>23</b> and the anti-abrasion member <b>224</b> For example, at a crossing point where lace <b>23</b> crosses tongue <b>36</b>, an axially extending (e.g. along the midline of the foot or ankle) ridge or edge may be provided in-between the boot tongue <b>36</b> and the lace <b>23</b>. This anti-abrasion member <b>224</b> is preferably molded or otherwise formed from a lubricious plastic such as PTFE, or other material as can be determined through routine experimentation. The lace <b>23</b> crosses the apex so that crossing friction would be limited to a small contact area and over a lubricious surface rather than along the softer tongue material or through the length of a channel or lumen as in previous embodiments. Tapered sides of the anti-abrasion member <b>224</b> would ensure that the anti-abrasion member <b>224</b> stayed reasonably flexible as well as help distribute the downward load evenly laterally across the foot. The length along the midline of the foot would vary depending upon the boot design. It may be as short as one inch long or less and placed on the tongue just where the lace crossing are, or it may extend along the entire length of the tongue with the raised ridge or crossing edge more prominent in the areas where the lace crosses and less prominent where more flexibility is desired. The anti-abrasion member <b>224</b> may be formed integrally with or attached to the tongue or could float on top of the tongue as in previously described disks.</p>
    <p num="p-0154">In one embodiment, the anti-abrasion member <b>224</b> is fixedly mounted on the tongue <b>36</b> using any of a wide variety of well known fasteners, such as rivets, screws, snaps, stitching, glue, etc. In another embodiment, the anti-abrasion member <b>224</b> is not attached to the tongue <b>36</b>, but rather freely floats atop the tongue <b>36</b> and is held in place through its engagement with the lace <b>23</b>. Alternatively, the anti-abrasion member <b>224</b> is integrally formed with the tongue <b>36</b>, such as by threading a first portion of the lace <b>23</b> through the tongue, and the second, crossing portion of lace <b>23</b> over the outside surface of the tongue.</p>
    <p num="p-0155">Alternatively, one or more of the sections of lace <b>23</b> which extend between the flaps <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> may slideably extend through a tubular protective sleeve. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, three crossover points are illustrated, each crossover point including a first and a second crossing segments of the lace <b>23</b>. A tubular protective sleeve may be provided on each of the first segments or on both the first and second segments at each of the crossover points. Alternatively, the short tubular protective sheaths may be provided on one or both of the segments of lace <b>23</b> at the central crossover point which, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, is illustrated as carrying the anti-abrasion member <b>24</b>. Optimizing the precise number and location of the protective tubular segments may be routinely accomplished, by those of skill in the art observing wear patterns of the lacing system in a particular shoe design.</p>
    <p num="p-0156">The tubular protective element may comprise any of a variety of tubular structures. Lengths of polymeric or metal tubing may be utilized. However, such tubular supports generally have a fixed axial length. Since the distance between the opposing flaps <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> will vary depending upon the size of the wearer's foot, the protective tubular sleeves should not be of such a great length that will inhibit tightening of the lacing system. The tubular protective sheaths may also have a variable axial length, to accommodate tightening and loosening of the lacing system. This may be accomplished, for example, by providing a tubular protective sheath which includes a slightly stretched spring coil wall. During tightening of the system, when each of the opposing flaps <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> are brought towards each other, the axial length of the spring guide may be compressed to accommodate various sizes. A further alternative comprises a tubular bellows-like structure having alternating smaller-diameter and larger-diameter sections, that may also be axially compressed or stretched to accommodate varying foot sizes. A variety of specific accordion structures, having pleats or other folds, will be apparent to those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein. As a further alternative, a telescoping tubular sleeve may be utilized. In this embodiment, at least a first tubular sleeve having a first diameter is carried by the lace <b>23</b>. At least a second tubular sleeve having a second, greater diameter is also carried by the lace <b>23</b>. The first tubular sleeve is axially slideably advanceable within the second tubular sleeve. Two or three or four or more telescoping tubes may be provided, for allowing the axial adjustability described above.</p>
    <p num="p-0157"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> schematically illustrates a top view of the insole region of the boot <b>20</b>. At least one lace locking member <b>232</b> (shown schematically) is disposed along the pathway of the lace <b>23</b>. Each locking member <b>232</b> is configured to engage the lace <b>23</b> and prevent a predetermined portion of the lace from moving axially, such as toward the tightening mechanism <b>25</b> to thereby limit the tension of the lace in a predetermined region. For example, a pair of locking members <b>232</b> <i>a </i>are located at points “a” along the lace pathway near the toe region of the flaps <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. After tension has been applied to the lace <b>23</b> via the tightening mechanism <b>25</b>, the locking members <b>232</b> <i>a </i>may be engaged with the lace <b>23</b> to prevent movement of the lace in region “a”. Once engaged, the locking members <b>232</b> <i>a </i>secure the tension in the lace <b>23</b> in region “a” by locking the position of the lace <b>23</b> at points “a” with respect to the tightening mechanism <b>25</b>. The lace tension in region “a” is thereby maintained even if the tension applied to the lace <b>23</b> by the tightening mechanism <b>25</b> is released or actuated. Thereafter, the tightening mechanism <b>25</b> may be released or actuated to apply a different level of tension or tightness in the lace outside of lace region “a”.</p>
    <p num="p-0158">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, locking members <b>232</b> may be disposed at any of a wide variety of locations along the lace pathway, such as locations “b”, and “c” to create various lace locking zones. By alternately locking and unlocking the locking members <b>232</b> and varying the tension in the lace <b>23</b>, a user may provide zones of varied tightness along the lace pathway.</p>
    <p num="p-0159"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref> show one embodiment of a locking member <b>232</b> that is coupled to the boot flap <b>32</b>. The locking member <b>232</b> comprises an actuator <b>234</b> having an elongate arm <b>235</b> that extends outwardly from an enlarged cam portion <b>236</b> having a rounded bottom edge <b>240</b>. The lace <b>23</b> is interposed between the rounded edge <b>240</b> of the cam portion <b>236</b> and the flap <b>32</b>. The enlarged cam portion <b>236</b> of the actuator <b>234</b> is rotatably mounted to the flap <b>32</b>, such as through a rotatable pin connector <b>242</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the actuator <b>234</b> may be moved to first or engaged position wherein the rounded edge <b>240</b> engages the lace <b>23</b> and applies a tightening force to secure the lace against the flap <b>32</b>. The locking member <b>232</b> thereby prevents movement of the lace <b>23</b> relative to the shoe flap <b>32</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0160">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the actuator <b>234</b> may also be moved to a second, non-engaged orientation wherein the rounded edge <b>240</b> of the cam portion <b>236</b> is removed from engagement with the lace <b>23</b> to thereby allow movement of the lace <b>23</b> relative to the flap <b>32</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0161"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows another embodiment of a lace locking member <b>312</b> comprised of a multi-piece structure including a first member <b>314</b> and a second member <b>322</b> coupled thereto. As best shown in the cross-sectional view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the first member has a pair of shafts <b>316</b> extending therethrough. A pair of bore holes <b>315</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>) in the first member <b>314</b> communicate with the shafts <b>316</b>. An elongate tubular compression clamp <b>320</b> is located within each of the shafts <b>316</b>. The shafts <b>316</b> and the compression clamps <b>320</b> are sized to receive the lace <b>23</b> therethrough, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0162">The second member <b>322</b> is movably coupled to the first member <b>314</b>. The second member <b>322</b> includes a pair of pegs <b>324</b> that extend into the bore holes <b>315</b> in the first member <b>314</b>. A screw <b>326</b> is coupled to the first member <b>314</b> and the second member <b>322</b>. The second member <b>322</b> may be incrementally moved toward the first member <b>314</b> by turning the screw <b>326</b>. As the screw <b>326</b> is turned, the pegs <b>324</b> incrementally slide into the lace shafts <b>316</b> and pinch or compress the compression clamps <b>320</b>. When the lace is disposed within the compression clamps <b>320</b>, the compression coupling between the pegs <b>324</b> and the compression clamps <b>320</b> is transferred to the lace <b>23</b> to inhibit the lace <b>23</b> from moving. The user may adjust the screw <b>326</b> to vary the level of compression that the pegs <b>324</b> apply to the lace <b>23</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0163">The compression clamps <b>320</b> are preferably made of a soft, deformable material that will deform when the pegs <b>324</b> apply pressure thereto. Advantageously, the soft compression clamps <b>320</b> exert sufficient compression to the lace <b>23</b> with reduced risk of deformation to the lace <b>23</b>. The locking member <b>312</b> may be disposed at various locations along the lace pathway to allow the user to create zones of varying tightness, as described previously.</p>
    <p num="p-0164">As mentioned, the locking members <b>232</b> may be located at any of a wide variety of locations along the lace pathway to allow the user to fix the position of the lace <b>23</b> at any of these locations. Other mechanical or structural designs may be used to lock the lace relative to the tightening mechanism. For example, the entryways of the guide members may be fitted with a collect to engage the lace <b>23</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0165"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a front view of the instep portion of the boot <b>20</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the tubular guide members <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> are mounted directly within the flaps <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, such as within or between single or multiple layers of material. Preferably, the tips <b>150</b> of each of the guide member <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> protrude outwardly from an inner edge <b>152</b> of each of the flaps <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. As best shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, a set of stitches <b>154</b> surrounds each guide member <b>50</b> and <b>52</b>. The stitches <b>154</b> are preferably positioned immediately adjacent the guide members <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> to create a gap <b>156</b> therebetween. For ease of illustration, the gap <b>156</b> is shown-having a relatively large size with respect to the diameter of the guide members <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>. However, the distance between each guide member <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> and the respective stitches <b>154</b> is preferably small.</p>
    <p num="p-0166">Preferably, each set of stitches <b>154</b> forms a pattern that closely matches the shape of the respective guide members so that the guide members <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> fit snug within the flaps <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. The stitches <b>154</b> thereby inhibit deformation of the guide members <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, particularly the internal radius thereof, when the lace is tightened. Advantageously, the stitches <b>154</b> also function as anchors that inhibit the guide members <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> from moving or shifting relative to the flaps <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> during tightening of the lace.</p>
    <p num="p-0167">The gap <b>156</b> may be partially or entirely filled with a material, such as glue, that is configured to stabilize the position of the guide members <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> relative to the flaps <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. The material is selected to further inhibit the guide members <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> from moving within the gap <b>156</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the guide members may also be equipped with anchoring members, such as tabs <b>160</b> of various shape, that are disposed at various locations thereon and that are configured to further inhibit the guide members <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> from moving or deforming relative to the flap <b>32</b>. The anchoring members may also comprise notches or grooves on the guide members <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> that generate friction when the guide members <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> begin to move and thereby inhibit further movement. The grooves may be formed using various methods, such as sanding, sandblasting, etching, etc.</p>
    <p num="p-0168">Axial movement of the guide tubes <b>50</b> or <b>52</b> may also be limited through the use of any of a variety of guide tube stops such as that illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref>. The guide tube stop includes a tubular body having an opening <b>51</b> which provides access to a central lumen <b>53</b> extending therethrough. The stop may also be provided with one or more fastening tabs <b>160</b>, for sewing or gluing to the shoe, as has been discussed. Tabs <b>160</b>, once stitched or otherwise secured into place, resist axial movement of the device along its longitudinal pathway.</p>
    <p num="p-0169">The central lumen <b>53</b> extends to a radially outwardly extending step <b>57</b>, producing a chamber <b>55</b> having a greater inside diameter than the lumen <b>53</b> at the opening <b>51</b>. Chamber <b>55</b> is dimensioned to slideably receive an end of a guide tube <b>50</b> or <b>52</b> therein. The annular step <b>57</b> inhibits movement of the guide tube in the direction of opening <b>51</b>. The stop may be manufactured in accordance with any of a variety of techniques, such as injection molding or machining from suitable materials including plastics and metal. In one embodiment, the guide tube <b>52</b> comprises plastic, and the stop comprises plastic. The end of the guide tube may be secured within chamber <b>55</b> using any of a variety of adhesives, solvent bonding, thermal bonding, interference fit or other techniques known in the art, or simply held in place by tension on the lace. In one embodiment, the tube <b>50</b> is bonded within the stop using adhesive.</p>
    <p num="p-0170">In any of the embodiments discussed elsewhere herein, the exit point on the lace guide or other structure may be made from a harder, more durable material than the rest of the lace guide. In the case of a tubular lace guide, the lace guide is often preferably flexible so that it can flex with the boot. Most of the wear takes place at the exit point of the cable, where reinforcement may be desirable. In addition, the tube stop can be made completely of metal or other high durometer material while the corresponding tubular lace guides are more flexible. This may be accomplished in a variety of ways, such as using metal or high durometer plastic ring inserts or attachments or coatings at the lace exit point as will be apparent to those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0171">By providing a stop on each end of a guide tube <b>50</b> or <b>52</b>, movement of the guide tube <b>50</b> or <b>52</b> along its longitudinal axis under normal use conditions can be prevented.</p>
    <p num="p-0172">In any of the foregoing embodiments, the external opening to the lace guide is subject to wear by the cable advancing in and out as the product is used. The durability of the lace guide may be improved by including an annular ring of a harder durometer material at the lace guide opening. Alternatively, a metal ring can be attached at each lace guide opening, using any of a variety of attachment techniques known in the art, including insert molding, adhesive bonding, threaded engagement and others known in the art. As a further alternative, a portion of the lumen extending through the lace guide may be lined using a metal tube such as an appropriately sized hypodermic needle tubing, taking into account the diameter of the lace. The tubing can extend slightly beyond the opening to the central lumen in the plastic-molded or formed part.</p>
    <p num="p-0173">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</figref>, an alternative guide member <b>250</b> comprises a thin, single-piece structure having an internal lumen <b>252</b> for passage of the lace <b>23</b> therethrough. The guide member <b>250</b> includes a main portion <b>254</b> that defines a substantially straight inner edge <b>256</b> of the guide member. A flange portion <b>260</b> extends peripherally around one side of the main portion <b>254</b>. As best shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the flange portion <b>260</b> comprises a region of reduced thickness with respect to the main portion <b>254</b>. An elongate slot <b>265</b> comprised of a second region of reduced thickness is located on the upper surface <b>266</b> <i>a </i>of the guide member <b>250</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0174">A pair of lace exit holes <b>262</b> extend through a side surface of the lace guide member <b>250</b> and communicate with the lumen <b>252</b>. The lace exit holes <b>262</b> may have an oblong shape to allow the lace <b>23</b> to exit therefrom at a variety of exit angles.</p>
    <p num="p-0175">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</figref>, a series of upper and lower channels <b>264</b> <i>a</i>, <b>264</b> <i>b</i>, respectively, extend through upper and lower surfaces <b>266</b> <i>a</i>, <b>266</b> <i>b</i>, respectively, of the lace guide member <b>250</b>. The channels <b>264</b> are arranged to extend along the pathway of the lumen <b>252</b> and communicate therewith. The location of each of the upper channels <b>264</b> <i>a </i>preferably successively alternates with the location of each of the lower channels <b>264</b> <i>b </i>along the lumen pathway so that the upper channels <b>264</b> <i>a </i>are offset with respect to the lower channels <b>264</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0176">With respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</figref>, the lace guide member <b>250</b> is mounted to the flaps <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> by inserting the flange region <b>260</b> directly within the flaps <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, such as within or between single or multiple layers <b>255</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>) of material. The layers <b>255</b> may be filled with a filler material <b>257</b> to maintain a constant thickness in the flaps <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0177">The lace guide member <b>250</b> may be secured to the flaps <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, for example, by stitching a thread through the flap <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and through the lace guide member <b>250</b> to form a stitch pattern <b>251</b>. The thread is preferably stitched through the reduced thickness regions of the flange portion <b>260</b> and the elongate slot <b>265</b>. Preferably, the flaps <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> are cut so that the main portion <b>254</b> of the guide member <b>250</b> is exposed on the flap <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> when the lace guide member <b>250</b> is mounted thereon.</p>
    <p num="p-0178">With respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the upper surface <b>266</b> <i>a </i>of the main portion of the guide member <b>250</b> is preferably maintained flush with the upper surface of the flaps <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> to maintain a smooth and continuous appearance and to eliminate discontinuities on the flaps <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. Advantageously, because the flange region <b>260</b> has a reduced thickness, the lace guide member <b>250</b> is configured to provide very little increase in the thickness of the flaps <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, and preferably no increase in the thickness of the flaps. The lace guide member <b>250</b> therefore does not create any lumps in the flaps <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> when the guide member <b>250</b> is mounted therein.</p>
    <p num="p-0179">As mentioned, a series of upper and lower offset channels <b>264</b> <i>a,b </i>extend through the lace guide member <b>250</b> and communicate with the lumen <b>252</b>. The offset arrangement of the channels advantageously facilitates manufacturing of the guide members <b>250</b> as a single structure, such as by using shut-offs in an injection mold process.</p>
    <p num="p-0180">The shape of the lumen may be approximately defined by an ellipse. In one embodiment, the ellipse has a major axis of about 0.970 inches and a minor axis of about 0.351 inches.</p>
    <p num="p-0181"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> is a side view of an alternative tightening mechanism <b>270</b>. The tightening mechanism <b>270</b> includes an outer housing <b>272</b> having a control mechanism, such as a rotatable knob <b>274</b>, mechanically coupled thereto. The rotatable knob <b>274</b> is slideably movable along an axis A between two positions with respect to the outer housing <b>272</b>. In a first, or engaged, position, the knob <b>274</b> is mechanically engaged with an internal gear mechanism located within the outer housing <b>272</b>, as described more fully below. In a second, or disengaged, position (shown in phantom) the knob is disposed upwardly with respect to the first position and is mechanically disengaged from the gear mechanism. A bottom plate <b>273</b> is disposed at a bottom end of the outer housing <b>272</b>. A set of mounting arms <b>275</b> extends radially outwardly from the bottom plate <b>273</b>, to removably engage a mounting structure discussed below.</p>
    <p num="p-0182"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the tightening mechanism <b>270</b>. A gear mechanism <b>276</b> (shown schematically) is disposed within a lower region of the outer housing <b>272</b> and is mechanically coupled to the rotatable knob <b>274</b> via a shaft <b>280</b>. The shaft <b>280</b> is mechanically coupled to the knob, such as through a spline interface.</p>
    <p num="p-0183">A lace wind-up spool <b>282</b> is interposed between the gear mechanism <b>276</b> and the control knob <b>274</b>. The shaft <b>280</b> is journaled through the spool <b>282</b>. The spool <b>282</b> is mechanically coupled to the gear mechanism <b>276</b>. The spool <b>282</b> includes a pair of annular grooves <b>284</b> <i>a,b </i>that are sized to receive the wound lace <b>23</b>. The spool <b>282</b> rotates about the axis of the shaft <b>280</b> in response to rotation of the control knob <b>274</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0184">The control knob <b>274</b> is configured to be incrementally rotated in a forward rotational direction, i.e., in a rotational direction that causes the lace <b>23</b> to wind around the spool <b>282</b>. Toward this end, the control knob <b>274</b> preferably includes a series of integrally-mounted pawls <b>277</b> that engage corresponding series of ratchets on the outer housing <b>272</b>. See <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31-32</figref>. The pawls <b>277</b> are preferably permanently engaged with the ratchets <b>279</b> when the control knob <b>274</b> is in the coupled or uncoupled position. The ratchet/pawl engagement prevents the knob <b>274</b> and the spool <b>282</b> from being rotated in a backwards direction (i.e., in a rotational direction opposite the rotational direction that winds the lace <b>23</b> around the spool <b>282</b>) when the knob <b>274</b> is in the coupled position. This configuration prevents the user from inadvertently winding the control knob <b>274</b> backwards, which could cause the lace <b>23</b> to kink or tangle in the spool <b>282</b>. The risk of tangling is especially high where a large length of lace <b>23</b> is wound around the spool, such as in the present case, where from about six inches up to about 2 feet of cable length (one half on each end) is wound around the spool <b>282</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0185">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, the knob <b>274</b> is illustrated to show moveability between two positions, a coupled position (left side of drawing) and an uncoupled position (right side of drawing). The pawls <b>277</b> on the knob <b>274</b> are slideably engaged with the ratchets on the case so they are engaged in either position so the knob can never be rotated backwards. In the engaged position, the spline teeth on the knob are coupled to the spline teeth on the shaft <b>280</b> which effectively couples the ratchet/pawl system to the gear train and spool <b>282</b> so the lace <b>23</b> cannot unwind. The only way to unwind the lace <b>23</b> from the spool <b>282</b> is to pull the knob <b>274</b> out into the uncoupled position which uncouples the splines allowing the spool to spin freely in either direction. The lace is then pulled off the spool manually. A deflectable indent washer mounted onto the shaft presses against the knob <b>274</b> and falls into one of two indents in the knob. This holds the knob by friction in either the coupled or uncoupled position. Although in this embodiment, the permanently engaged ratchet/pawl assembly is uncoupled from the spool by pulling out the knob, this uncoupling could be accomplished in several different ways by someone skilled in the art.</p>
    <p num="p-0186">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, a pair of lace entry holes <b>296</b> <i>a,b </i>are disposed on the side of the outer housing <b>272</b> of the tightening mechanism <b>270</b>. The lace entry holes <b>296</b> <i>a,b </i>communicate with the annular grooves <b>284</b> <i>a,b</i>, respectively, in the spool <b>282</b>. A pair of lace retention holes <b>300</b> <i>a,b </i>are disposed in the spool within the grooves <b>284</b> <i>a,b</i>. respectively. Each of the lace retention holes <b>300</b> <i>a,b </i>comprises a cylindrical bore that extends radially into the spool <b>282</b>. The lace retention holes <b>300</b> <i>a,b </i>are sized to receive the end of lace <b>23</b> therein. A pair of counterbores <b>302</b> extend downwardly through the spool <b>282</b> and communicate with the lace retention holes <b>300</b> <i>a,b</i>. An attachment device, such as set screw <b>304</b>, is disposed within each of the counterbores <b>302</b>. The set screws <b>304</b> may be rotated to incrementally project bottom ends thereof into the lace retention holes <b>300</b> <i>a,b. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0187">The spool <b>282</b> may be rotated so that each of the lace retention holes <b>300</b> <i>a,b </i>aligns with a corresponding lace entry hole <b>296</b> <i>a,b</i>, respectively, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>. Toward this end, an alignment hole <b>301</b> is located in the spool <b>282</b> and a corresponding alignment hole <b>303</b> is located in the outer housing <b>272</b>. The two alignment holes <b>301</b>, <b>303</b> may be aligned through rotation of the spool <b>282</b>. Preferably, when the holes <b>301</b>, <b>303</b> are aligned, the lace retention holes <b>300</b> are also aligned with the lace entry holes <b>296</b>. The user may thereby quickly and easily align the lace retention holes <b>300</b> with the lace entry holes <b>296</b> by aligning the alignment holes <b>301</b>, <b>303</b> and then inserting a pin therein to fix the position of the spool <b>282</b> with respect to the outer housing <b>272</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0188">The lace <b>23</b> is installed onto the tightening mechanism <b>270</b> by first rotating the spool <b>282</b> so that the lace retention holes <b>300</b> <i>a,b </i>align with the corresponding lace entry holes <b>296</b> <i>a,b</i>, as described above. The ends of the lace <b>23</b> are then each inserted into separate lace entry holes <b>296</b> <i>a,b </i>until the lace ends abut an inner surface of the lace retention holes <b>300</b> <i>a,b</i>. The set screws <b>304</b> are then individually rotated so that the bottom ends of the set screws <b>304</b> engaged or pinch the lace ends to thereby secures the lace <b>23</b> within the retention holes <b>300</b> <i>a,b</i>. The control knob <b>274</b> may be rotated in the forward direction to wind the lace <b>23</b> around the spool <b>282</b>. The lace <b>23</b> may be removed from the spool <b>282</b> by loosening the set screws <b>304</b> to disengage the set screws <b>304</b> from the lace end and then pulling the lace <b>23</b> from the spool <b>282</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0189">As mentioned, the lace entry holes <b>296</b> <i>a,b </i>should be aligned with the corresponding lace retention holes <b>300</b> <i>a,b </i>when inserting the lace ends into the entry holes <b>296</b> <i>a,b</i>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, the lace end will not enter the retention hole <b>300</b> but will rather abut the inner surface of the spool <b>282</b> if the holes <b>296</b>, <b>300</b> are not correctly aligned. The user will then not be able to engage the set screw with the lace <b>23</b>. The ends of the lace <b>23</b> preferably each include a marker or indicator <b>310</b> to assist the user in installing the lace <b>23</b> into the lace retention hole <b>300</b> <i>a,b</i>. The indicator <b>310</b> is located a preselected distance from the end of the lace <b>23</b>, which is preferably substantially equal to the distance D between the inner surface of the lace retention hole <b>300</b> and the location of lace entry hole <b>296</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0190">If the lace entry hole <b>296</b> and the lace retention hole <b>300</b> are misaligned during installation of the lace <b>23</b>, the indicator <b>310</b> will be clearly visible to the user, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. However, if the lace <b>23</b> is correctly positioned within the lace retention hole <b>300</b>, the indicator <b>310</b> will be flush with the entry point of the lace entry hole <b>296</b>. Advantageously, the user can confirm the that lace is correctly positioned within the lace retention hole <b>300</b> when the indicator on the lace is aligned with the entry point of the lace entry hole <b>296</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0191">The tightening mechanism <b>270</b> may be removably mounted to the front, back, top or sides of the boot. In the illustrated embodiment, the tightening mechanism is mounted to the tongue <b>36</b> of the boot <b>20</b> between the flaps <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. In one embodiment, a bayonet-type mounting system is used to mount the tightening mechanism <b>270</b> to the tongue <b>36</b>. The tongue <b>36</b> may include a sheet of flexible material, such as plastic, mounted therein or thereover. The material may include die-cut hole that mates with a corresponding bayonet structure on the bottom plate <b>273</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>) of the tightening mechanism <b>270</b>. The die cut hole may be, for example, key-shaped so that the bayonet structure may be inserted therein and twisted to lock the bayonet structure within the hole.</p>
    <p num="p-0192">The base for one bayonet mounting system is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</figref>. The mounting ring <b>330</b> comprises an attachment structure <b>332</b> for attachment to the boot. In the illustrated embodiment, the attachment structure <b>332</b>, comprises a radially outwardly extending flange suitable for attachment to the tongue or other portion of the boot by sewing, adhesive bonding, grommets or other fastening techniques known in the art. The mounting ring <b>330</b> is provided with a central aperture <b>334</b> for removably receiving the base of a reel. One or more axially extending recesses <b>336</b> are provided, to slideably receive one or more mounting arms <b>275</b> therethrough. When the base of the reel has been advanced into the aperture <b>334</b> such that the mounting tab <b>275</b> has advanced through the length of the groove <b>336</b>, the base of the reel may be rotated to offset the mounting tab <b>275</b> from the groove <b>336</b> thereby locking the reel in place. In the illustrated embodiment, four grooves <b>336</b> are illustrated to accommodate four mounting tabs <b>275</b>. Preferably, two or more corresponding <b>336</b> and mounting tabs <b>275</b> will be utilized to provide secure retention.</p>
    <p num="p-0193">A releasable lock <b>338</b> may also be provided. The lock <b>338</b> preferably resists rotation of the base such that the base can become separated from the mounting ring <b>330</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the lock <b>338</b> comprises a flexible arm <b>340</b> having a radially inwardly extending engagement surface <b>342</b> such as on a tooth. Once the base has been advanced through the aperture <b>334</b> and rotated to provide an interference fit, the engagement surface <b>342</b> advances under the spring bias supplied by arm <b>340</b> into a corresponding recess on the base. By rounding the edges of the tooth, and dimensioning the recess, the engagement provided by lock <b>338</b> can be sufficient to resist detachment under normal use conditions. However, when removal of the spool is desired, the spool may be forced to rotate by overcoming the resistance provided by lock <b>338</b> as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein. Advantageously, such a design allows the tightening mechanism to be quickly and easily mounted and dismounted from the boot <b>20</b> without the use of tools. Alternatively, it may be desirable to prevent removal of the reel from the bayonet without the use of a special tool. This latter construction will minimize accidental removal of the reel. Any of a variety of locking structures, which may be released using a special screw driver or other tool may be readily incorporated into the present design. Alternatively, a small aperture in the reel may be provided, into which a wire such as a paper clip size pin is inserted to advance a release mechanism to release the reel to bayonet.</p>
    <p num="p-0194">Certain functional advantages of embodiments of the present invention can be further illustrated in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30 through 32</figref>. In particular, the closure system includes a rotatable spool for receiving a lace. The spool is rotatable in a first direction to take up lace and a second direction to release lace. A knob is connected to the spool such that the spool can be rotated in the first direction to take up lace only in response to rotation of the knob. A releasable lock is provided for preventing rotation of the spool in the second direction. One convenient lock mechanism is released by pulling the knob axially away from the boot, thereby enabling the spool to rotate in the second direction to unwind lace. However, the spool rotates in the second direction only in response to traction on the lace. The spool is not rotatable in the second direction in response to rotation of the knob. This prevents tangling of the lace in or around the spool, which could occur if reverse rotation on the knob could cause the lace to loosen in the absence of a commensurate traction on the lace.</p>
    <p num="p-0195">Thus, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, a knob <b>274</b> is shown split down the middle such that the left half of the figure illustrates the knob in the coupled position and the right half of the figure illustrates the knob in the uncoupled position. In the coupled position, rotation of the knob in the forward direction winds lace around the reel. Unwinding of the lace is prevented, despite the tension in the tightened system. In the uncoupled position, traction on the lace causes the reel to unwind. However, the reel is not windable in the reverse direction by rotating the knob.</p>
    <p num="p-0196">One manner of accomplishing the foregoing is to provide a spline <b>314</b> on the shaft, for engagement with a spline <b>312</b> on the knob when the knob is in the coupled position. As illustrated, when the knob <b>274</b> is in the uncoupled position, the spline <b>314</b> on the shaft is disengaged from the spline <b>312</b> on the knob, thereby enabling the reel to be wound in a reverse direction in response to traction on the lace. A radially moveable indent washer <b>316</b> is slideably moveable between an uncoupled recess <b>318</b> and a coupled recess <b>320</b>. Any of a wide variety of structures can be utilized to accomplish this result as will be apparent to those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein. The indent washer <b>316</b> both inhibits accidental movement of the knob <b>274</b> from the coupled position to the uncoupled position, and also provides tactile feedback to the user so that the knob will snap into the coupled position or the uncoupled position as desired. A stabilizing washer <b>322</b> or other spacer may also be provided, to prevent wobbling of the knob <b>274</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0197">Detailed views shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31A and 31B</figref> and <b>32</b> illustrate, for example, a plurality of integrally molded pawls <b>277</b> on the knob <b>274</b>. The pawls <b>277</b> are sufficiently axially elongated that they engage the housing in both the coupled position and the uncoupled position to prevent reverse rotation of the knob <b>274</b>. The corresponding ratchet teeth <b>279</b> on the case are illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0198">In the foregoing embodiments, the wearer must pull a sufficient length of cable from the spool to enable the wearer's foot to enter or exit the footwear. The resulting slack cable requires a number of turns of the reel to wind in before the boot begins to tighten. An optional feature in accordance with the present invention is the provision of a spring drive or bias within the spool that automatically winds in the slack cable, similar to the mechanism in a self biased automatically winding tape measure. The spring bias in the spool is generally not sufficiently strong to tighten the boot but is sufficient to wind in the slack. The wearer would then engage the knob and manually tighten the system to the desired tension.</p>
    <p num="p-0199">The self winding spring may also be utilized to limit the amount of cable which can be accepted by the spool. This may be accomplished by calibrating the length of the spring so that following engagement of the knob and tightening of the boot, the knob can only be rotated a preset additional number of turns before the spring bottoms out and the knob is no longer able to be turned. This limits how much lace cable could be wound onto the spool. Without a limit such as this, if a cable is used which is too long, the wearer may accidentally wind in the lace cable until it jams tightly against the reel housing and cannot be pulled back out.</p>
    <p num="p-0200">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33-35</figref>, alternative embodiments of a lacing system <b>22</b> have an outer housing <b>400</b> comprising a base member <b>402</b> and a knob <b>404</b>. The outer housing is preferably injection molded out of any suitable material, as discussed above, but in one embodiment, is formed of nylon. Of course, any suitable manufacturing process that produces mating parts fitting within the design tolerances is suitable for the manufacture of the components disclosed herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0201">The base member <b>402</b> is generally a hollow cylinder further having a relatively thin and flat mounting flange <b>406</b> that extends generally radially from around about half of the base member <b>402</b> circumference. In some embodiments, the mounting flange <b>406</b> extends from approximately the bottom surface <b>410</b> of the base member, while in other embodiments, the mounting flange <b>406</b> extends from about midway between the top edge <b>412</b> and the bottom surface of the base member. The mounting flange <b>406</b>, as described above, is configured to be attached to the footwear in any acceptable manner. In one preferred embodiment, the mounting flange <b>406</b> is stitched onto the footwear during manufacture. As discussed above, it may be securely attached by any suitable method, such as, for example, by adhesives, rivets, threaded fasteners, and the like. Alternatively, the mounting flange <b>406</b> may be removably attached, such as by a releasable mechanical bonding structure in the form of cooperating hook and loop structure, for example.</p>
    <p num="p-0202">The mounting flange <b>406</b> may be disposed between layers of the footwear upper, or may be disposed on top of, or underneath, the footwear upper material. The method and location of attachment of the base member <b>402</b> is dictated primarily by fashion design, and hence, could conceivably be mounted in any of a number of locations and by any suitable method.</p>
    <p num="p-0203">The base member <b>402</b> cylindrical portion includes sloped teeth <b>414</b> formed into its inner surface. The base member teeth <b>414</b> may be formed during the molding process, or may be subsequently cut therein, and each defines a sloped portion <b>416</b> and a substantially radial surface <b>418</b>. In one embodiment, the sloped portion <b>416</b> of each tooth <b>414</b> allows relative clockwise rotation of a cooperating pawl, while inhibiting relative counterclockwise rotation of an engaging pawl. Of course, the teeth direction could be reversed as desired. The number and spacing of teeth <b>414</b> controls the fineness of adjustment possible, and the specific number and spacing can be designed to suit the intended purpose by one of skill in the art in light of this disclosure. However, in many applications, it is desirable to have a fine adjustment of the lace tension, and the inventors hereof have found that approximately 20 to 40 teeth <b>414</b> are sufficient to provide an adequately fine adjustment of the lace tension.</p>
    <p num="p-0204">The base member <b>402</b> additionally contains a pair of lace entry holes <b>420</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>) for allowing each end of a lace to enter therein. As discussed above, the base member <b>402</b> lace entry holes <b>420</b> may be made more robust by the addition of higher durometer materials either as inserts or coatings to reduce the wear caused by the laces abrading against the base member <b>402</b> entry holes <b>420</b>. Additionally, the site of the entry hole can be rounded or chamfered to provide a larger area of contact with the lace to further reduce the pressure abrasion effects of the lace rubbing on the base unit.</p>
    <p num="p-0205">A lace guide <b>422</b> can be formed integrally with the base member and can be configured depending upon the specific application of the lacing system <b>22</b>. For example, in a traditional lacing application where the laces zigzag across the tongue of the boot or shoe, the laces may extend in a lacing path that enters the base member from directions that are diametrically opposed. For this application, the lace guides <b>422</b> may extend substantially radially from the base member <b>402</b>, as discussed above. Alternatively, in applications where the lace path results in substantially parallel laces entering the base member, a pair of lace guides <b>422</b> can be integrally molded into the base unit to receive the laces and direct them to opposing sides of the spool for subsequent winding and collection.</p>
    <p num="p-0206">It is preferable that the inner bottom surface <b>424</b> of the base member is highly lubricious to allow mating components an efficient sliding engagement therewith. Accordingly, in one embodiment, a washer or bushing <b>426</b> is disposed within the cylindrical portion of the base member <b>402</b>, and may be formed of any suitable lubricious polymer, such as PTFE, for example, or may be formed of a lubricious metal. Alternatively, the inner bottom surface <b>424</b> of the base member <b>402</b> may be coated with any of a number of coatings designed to reduce its coefficient of friction and thereby allow any components sharing surface contact therewith to easily slide.</p>
    <p num="p-0207">With additional reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, a spool <b>426</b> is configured to reside within the cylindrical portion of the base member and is configured with sloped teeth <b>428</b>, such as those found on a ratchet, as has been described herein above in great detail. In one preferred embodiment, the spool <b>426</b> is formed of metal, such as aluminum, by any standard chip producing, material removal machining operation. Alternatively, the spool <b>426</b> may be cast or molded, and may be formed of any suitable polymer. In another preferred embodiment, the spool is formed of nylon and may optionally have a metal plate insert.</p>
    <p num="p-0208">In cooperating with the washer or bushing <b>426</b> disposed on the inner bottom surface <b>424</b> of the base member <b>402</b>, the lower surface of the spool <b>426</b> is likewise configured for efficient sliding engagement. Accordingly, a second washer <b>430</b> formed of highly lubricious material may be provided, or alternatively, the lower surface of the spool <b>426</b> may be configured to reduce its coefficient of friction such that the spool <b>426</b> easily spins within the base member <b>402</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, this is accomplished by providing a lip <b>431</b> that offers a small surface area that contacts the bottom surface <b>424</b> of the base member <b>402</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0209">The spool <b>426</b> has one or more grooves <b>433</b> formed therein to receive the lace <b>435</b>. As described in detail above, there may be one or more grooves that are configured to receive the wound up lace. In one embodiment, the lace passes through holes <b>437</b> formed in the spool base member <b>432</b> and are securely held in the spool. In one embodiment, the lace <b>435</b> has two ends that are tied together. In this particular embodiment, the spool <b>426</b> can be configured with a recess <b>438</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>) to accompany the knot formed by the lace ends.</p>
    <p num="p-0210">The spool base <b>432</b> is preferably circular in shape and is configured to reside within the base member <b>402</b>. In order to inhibit contact between the outer spool surface and the inner periphery of the base member <b>402</b>, an axle <b>434</b> is provided that extends through the central axis of the spool <b>426</b> to maintain the spool <b>426</b> in the center of the base member <b>402</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0211">In one preferred embodiment, the axle <b>434</b> is a metallic hollow tube, such as a brass tube, that fits down through the center axis of the spool <b>426</b>. The axle <b>434</b> may be configured with bored ends, or may be threaded, for receiving threaded fasteners. In one embodiment, a screw passes through the knob <b>404</b>, through the axle <b>434</b>, and threads into a threaded insert provided in the base member <b>402</b>. Alternatively, a screw passes through the bottom of the outer housing and is threaded into one end of the axle <b>434</b>. The spool <b>426</b> is installed onto the axle <b>434</b>, and the knob <b>404</b> is attached to the axle <b>434</b> by a second threaded fastener. In either case, the base member <b>402</b> and knob <b>404</b> are interconnected by the axle <b>434</b>, which provides an axis of rotation for the spool <b>426</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0212">Additionally, the spool <b>426</b> may contain a bushing, bearing, or other form of friction reducing device along its central axis to allow it to easily revolve around the axle <b>434</b>. The axle <b>434</b> can additionally carry a washer <b>430</b> disposed between the reel and the washer or bushing <b>426</b> disposed in the base member <b>402</b> to further reduce rotational friction of the spool <b>426</b>. This type of rotatable connection maintains the spool <b>426</b> at the center of the base member <b>402</b> and thereby inhibits friction caused by the outer periphery of the spool <b>426</b> contacting the inner periphery of the base member <b>402</b>, while still allowing the spool <b>426</b> to freely spin within the base member <b>402</b>. Accordingly, without any interference from other components, the rotatable connection of the spool <b>426</b> allows it to freely rotate in either direction.</p>
    <p num="p-0213">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, the spool <b>426</b> is additionally configured with one or more sloped teeth <b>428</b> disposed generally above the spool base <b>432</b>. The spool teeth <b>428</b> are preferably configured to allow relative counterclockwise rotation, while inhibiting relative clockwise rotation of a corresponding pawl.</p>
    <p num="p-0214">As discussed above, it is preferable that the laces are attached to the spool <b>426</b> at substantially diametrically opposed locations to provide a simultaneous and equivalent tension to each lace as a winding force is imparted to the spool <b>426</b>. Moreover, the preferred lace attachment configuration applies balanced forces to the spool <b>426</b> to protect the spool <b>426</b> from transverse bending forces that could cause the journal connection to prematurely wear. For example, if the laces engaged the spool <b>426</b> from directions forming a ninety degree angle, the forces imparted by the tension in the wound laces would apply a shear force to the axle <b>434</b> of the spool <b>426</b>. If, however, the laces were diametrically attached to the spool <b>426</b>, the resultant force on the spool <b>426</b> from the equivalent opposing tension forces would be zero, thus protecting the spool <b>426</b> and its journaled connection from wear resulting from transverse forces.</p>
    <p num="p-0215">The spool <b>426</b> further comprises one or more annular grooves, as described above, configured to receive the wound up lace. The groove is preferably configured to contain the full length of the lace while minimizing any tendency for the lace to become loose within the housing <b>400</b> and potentially becoming jammed, or interfering with additional components contained within the outer housing <b>400</b>. In some preferred embodiments, two annular grooves separated by an annular ridge are provided to segregate each end of the lace to reduce the likelihood of jamming or binding the mechanism. The lace grooves are preferably located below the spool teeth <b>428</b> and spool base, but could optionally be located above the spool teeth <b>428</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0216">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>37</b> <i>b</i>, a pawl spring <b>440</b> comprises a central horizontally flat circular section <b>442</b> attached to two diametrical arm sections <b>444</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, each arm section <b>444</b> is attached to the circular section <b>442</b> by a corresponding bridge <b>446</b>, and may be attached in any suitable manner, such as by welding, or may be formed integrally therewith. The arm sections <b>444</b> are generally disposed below the central flat circular section <b>442</b> and are flat in a vertical plane.</p>
    <p num="p-0217">Extending in a counterclockwise direction from each arm section is an outer pawl <b>450</b>. Each outer pawl <b>450</b> is configured to terminate outside the periphery of the spool base <b>432</b>, as described later below, and is configured to contact the base member sloped teeth <b>416</b>. Therefore, when turning one direction, the outer pawls <b>450</b> are free to rotate relative to the base member <b>402</b>, while the base member <b>402</b> sloped teeth inhibit relative movement in the opposite direction.</p>
    <p num="p-0218">Extending in a clockwise direction from each arm section is a spool pawl <b>452</b>. The spool pawl <b>452</b> is configured to terminate within the periphery of the spool base <b>432</b>, as described later, and is configured to contact the sloped teeth <b>428</b> of the spool <b>426</b>. Therefore, while turning one direction, the spool pawls <b>452</b> interfere with the sloped teeth <b>428</b> of the spool <b>426</b>, and cause the spool <b>426</b> to turn concurrently with the pawl spring <b>442</b>. However, if the spool pawls <b>452</b> are removed from contact with the spool sloped teeth <b>428</b>, the spool <b>426</b> is free to rotate. Of course, it should be understood that the illustrated components could be reversed such that the tightening and loosening directions are opposite from those described. However, for clarity, the reel will primarily be discussed by utilizing a design in which a clockwise rotation tightens the lace, while a counterclockwise rotation allows the lace to unwind.</p>
    <p num="p-0219">In one preferred embodiment, the pawl spring <b>442</b>, arms sections <b>444</b>, and pawls <b>450</b>, <b>452</b> are formed unitarily from a high temper sheet metal. The entire spring <b>442</b> may be stamped out of a single sheet of high temper sheet metal, such as, for example, spring steel or stainless steel, and then the arm sections <b>444</b> can be plastically bent to be orthogonal to the original plane of the flat material. Additionally, the spool pawls <b>452</b> and outer pawls <b>450</b> can be permanently bent relative to the arm sections <b>444</b>. This may be done either prior or subsequent to the arm sections receiving a bend.</p>
    <p num="p-0220">The residual stresses formed in the spring <b>440</b> may optionally be compensated for such as by heat working to allow the relieve the residual stresses caused by plastic deformation. In other embodiments, the residual stresses are beneficial as they add to the resiliency of the spring <b>440</b>. For example, the spool pawl <b>452</b> is configured to be biased inwardly; however, the residual stresses created by bending the spool pawl <b>452</b> with respect to the arm section <b>444</b> will tend to force the spool pawl <b>452</b> outward. To compensate for this stress, which could ultimately cause the spool pawl <b>452</b> to lose its desired bias, the spool pawl <b>452</b> may be bent to a more acute angle than necessary and then bent back to its desired angle. By bending the spool pawl <b>452</b> beyond the desired angle and then plastically returning it to its desired angle, the residual stresses now naturally bias the spool pawl <b>452</b> in an inward direction.</p>
    <p num="p-0221">Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily realize that several types of springs and/or spring-loaded devices will provide an equivalent structure and equivalent function to that of the disclosed pawl spring <b>440</b>. However, the applicants believe the disclosed method is a suitably quick and efficient construction.</p>
    <p num="p-0222">Returning to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33-35</figref>, a knob <b>404</b> is configured to fit over and close the open end of the base member <b>402</b> and generally circumscribe the outer periphery thereof. The knob <b>404</b> can be securely attached to the spool <b>426</b> or axle by a screw, as described above. In this way, the outer housing <b>400</b> is complete with the base member <b>402</b> and the knob <b>404</b> both securely attached to the spool <b>426</b>. Of course, the knob <b>404</b> may be attached through alternative structure. For example, the knob <b>404</b> and base member <b>402</b> can have a cooperating annular ridge and annular groove designed to provide a secure connection therebetween. In this type of connection, the annular ridge can be configured on either the knob <b>404</b> or the base member <b>402</b>, with the corresponding annular groove being formed on the other component. Furthermore, to provide additional support to the spool <b>426</b>, the knob <b>404</b> can contain an integral axle configured to extend down into the spool <b>426</b> for providing a rotational connection. The knob <b>404</b> may be subsequently removed by prying the knob <b>404</b> from the lower unit, with the required force determined by the specific configuration of the cooperating annular groove and ridge. In either disclosed embodiment, the spool <b>426</b> is journaled for rotational movement within the outer housing <b>400</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0223">The pawl spring <b>440</b> is constrained to rotate with the knob <b>404</b> in at least one direction, such as a winding direction, which is some embodiments is clockwise. This may be accomplished in any of a number of ways, one of which is by forming protrusions on the underside of the knob <b>404</b> that contact the pawl spring <b>440</b> as the knob <b>404</b> is rotated, thereby imparting a rotational force to the pawl spring <b>440</b>. With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38 and 39</figref>, a portion of the underside of the knob <b>404</b> has a pair of protrusions <b>454</b> extending therefrom. Each protrusion <b>454</b> contains an interfering surface <b>456</b> that contacts the bridge <b>446</b> of the pawl spring <b>440</b> and causes it to rotate concurrently therewith. Additionally, each protrusion contains a ramp <b>458</b>, as will be discussed in greater detail below.</p>
    <p num="p-0224">An alternative structure that allows the knob <b>404</b> to impart a rotational force to the pawl spring <b>440</b> comprises a recess formed into the underside of the knob <b>404</b> that corresponds generally with the shape of the pawl spring <b>440</b> such that when the outer housing <b>400</b> and its internal components are assembled, the pawl spring <b>440</b> center section <b>442</b> and bridge sections <b>446</b> securely reside within the recess in the underside of the knob <b>404</b>. Of course, the pawl spring <b>440</b> may be constrained for concurrent rotation in one or both directions with the knob <b>404</b> by any suitable method, such as alternative interfering structure, adhesives, clips, snaps, mechanical bonding, chemical bonding, heat bonding, or any such suitable interaction.</p>
    <p num="p-0225">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>, the interaction and operation of the components is illustrated. As the knob <b>404</b> and concomitant spring <b>440</b> are rotated in a clockwise direction, the outer pawls <b>450</b> slide past the base member <b>402</b> sloped teeth. Simultaneously, the spool pawls <b>452</b> contact and interfere with the spool teeth <b>428</b>, also referred to herein as ratchet teeth, thereby imparting a rotating force to the spool <b>426</b>. Thus, as the knob <b>404</b> turns clockwise, the spool <b>426</b> also turns clockwise, thereby winding the lace about the spool <b>426</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0226">Moreover, as the outer pawls <b>450</b> slide past the base member teeth <b>416</b> and are repeatedly deflected by the high slope of the teeth <b>416</b> and resiliently spring outwardly to contact the low slope of the teeth <b>416</b>, an audible and tactile feedback is provided to the user to indicate incremental winding and tightening of the lace about the spool <b>426</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0227">The spacing of the base member <b>402</b> sloped teeth controls the precision of incremental adjustment. For example, if only two or three base member teeth <b>416</b> are present, the knob <b>404</b> must be wound either one half or one third revolutions, respectively, to reach the next increment. Otherwise, the tension in the lace will cause the spool <b>426</b> to unwind until the outer pawls <b>450</b> contact the base member <b>402</b> teeth. Accordingly, while the number and spacing of the base member teeth <b>416</b> is not critical to practice the invention, those of ordinary skill will realize that an appropriate number of base member teeth <b>416</b> should be provided to provide acceptable adjustment increments, such as, for example, 20 to 40 or more teeth.</p>
    <p num="p-0228">As the lace becomes wound about the spool <b>426</b>, its tension increases and thereby imparts a rotation force to the spool <b>426</b> in an unwinding direction. This unwinding force is counteracted by the interference between the spool pawls <b>452</b> and the spool teeth <b>428</b> in combination with the interference between the outer pawls <b>450</b> and base member <b>402</b> teeth.</p>
    <p num="p-0229">For example, during initial turning of the knob <b>404</b> and pawl spring <b>440</b> in a clockwise direction, the spool pawls <b>452</b> resiliently fall down the slope of the spool teeth <b>428</b> and contact the substantially radial tooth face <b>462</b> of the adjacent tooth. Further rotation of the knob <b>404</b> and pawl spring <b>440</b> in a winding direction <b>464</b> imparts a torque, or winding force, to the spool <b>426</b> which rotates and thereby winds the lace about the spool <b>426</b>. When the winding force is removed, any tension in the lace will impart a torque in an unwinding direction <b>466</b>, or unwinding force, to the spool <b>426</b> and cause it to rotate in a counterclockwise direction. Consequently, as the spool <b>426</b> attempts to turn in a counterclockwise direction, the interaction between the radial tooth face <b>462</b> and the spool pawl <b>452</b> cause the pawl spring <b>440</b> to rotate counterclockwise with the spool <b>426</b>. As such, the outer pawls <b>450</b> contact the substantially radial face <b>468</b> of the base member <b>402</b> teeth and thereby prevent further unwinding of the spool <b>426</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0230">In order to effectuate unwinding of the spool <b>426</b>, it must become free of the spool pawls <b>452</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, this is accomplished by rotating the knob <b>404</b> and pawl spring <b>440</b> in a counterclockwise direction through predetermined angular displacement, which in one embodiment, is about one quarter turn. As the knob <b>404</b> and pawl spring <b>440</b> are rotated counterclockwise, structure on the knob <b>404</b> will contact the spool pawls <b>452</b> which deflect outwardly in response thereto, thus freeing the spool <b>426</b> for rotation.</p>
    <p num="p-0231">More specifically, one or more ramps <b>456</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38 and 39</figref>) are formed on the underside of the knob <b>404</b>. The ramps <b>456</b> are configured such that counterclockwise rotation of the knob <b>404</b> causes the ramps <b>456</b> to contact the spool pawls <b>452</b>, which slide up the ramps <b>456</b> and thereby deflect outwardly away from the spool teeth <b>428</b>. Once the spool pawls <b>452</b> extend up the ramp a sufficient distance, the spool pawls <b>452</b> are clear of the spool teeth <b>428</b>. Accordingly, the spool pawls <b>452</b> will be deflected a sufficient distance to become free from the spool <b>426</b>, thereby allowing the spool <b>426</b> to freewheel spin in response to the unwinding force applied by the tensioned lace. In this embodiment, the knob <b>404</b> must be held in its releasing position until the spool <b>426</b> unwinds, otherwise, the spool pawl <b>452</b> will resiliently return to its unbiased position and interfere with continued unwinding of the spool <b>426</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0232">Of course, other suitable methods and structure could be used to effectuate unwinding of the spool <b>426</b>. For example, a push button (not shown) located on top of the knob <b>404</b> could be coupled to the spool pawls <b>452</b> in such as way that depression of the push button forces the spool pawls <b>452</b> resiliently outward, thus allowing free rotation of the spool <b>426</b>. Other structure causing the spool pawls <b>452</b> to deflect outwardly will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure.</p>
    <p num="p-0233">Accordingly, in the described embodiments, as the illustrated spool pawl <b>452</b> deflects outwardly, its interfering contact with the spool <b>426</b> is released, which is then free to rotate. As such, the spool <b>426</b> unwinds in response to the unwinding force imparted by the lace tension, thereby loosing the tension in the lace and releasing the closing force of the footwear about the wearer's foot. The lace is preferably maintained within the reel such that it cannot escape once loosened.</p>
    <p num="p-0234">An important realization is that it may be possible for the knob <b>404</b> to become inadvertently twisted during use, such as by impact with another object like another shoe, sporting implement, or the ground, for example, thereby resulting in unintentional or accidental unwinding of the laces. This could have unfortunate results, especially during strenuous physical activity when strict fit and control of the footwear is critical. Accordingly, the reel or knob <b>404</b> can be configured with a safety mechanism for preventing unintentional and accidental unwinding.</p>
    <p num="p-0235">In one embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40 and 41</figref>, the safety mechanism comprises a lever <b>470</b> or button that must be depressed in order to rotate the knob <b>404</b> in a counterclockwise direction. The lever is hingedly connected to the base member <b>402</b> in any suitable manner. However, in one embodiment, a pair of apertures <b>472</b> are provided for receiving a pair of pins <b>474</b> extending from connecting arms <b>476</b> of the lever <b>470</b>. Additionally, it is preferable that the lever <b>470</b> is biased in an upward direction, and accordingly, a spring can be provided underneath the lever <b>470</b> to give the desired bias. As illustrated, the base member <b>402</b> includes a lever flange <b>480</b> that defines the lever travel limit in a depressed direction and further contains a boss (not shown) for holding a coil spring (not shown) between the lever flange <b>480</b> and lever <b>470</b>. Accordingly, as the lever <b>470</b> is depressed, the coil spring becomes compressed, thereby imparting a restoring force to bias the lever in an upward direction.</p>
    <p num="p-0236">The lever interacts with the knob <b>404</b> to prevent unintentional counterclockwise rotation. In one embodiment, this is accomplished by providing lock teeth <b>482</b> on the lever <b>470</b> that cooperate with knob teeth <b>484</b> (of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>) to prevent relative rotation of the knob <b>404</b>. The lever <b>470</b> is biased upwardly, thus biasing the lock teeth <b>482</b> against the knob teeth <b>484</b>, which interfere with one another to inhibit counterclockwise rotation of the knob <b>404</b> relative to the lever <b>470</b>. The knob teeth <b>482</b> can be strategically spaced around the knob <b>404</b> to coincide with the winding increments of the reel. As such, for each winding increment, there is a corresponding locking position that allows the lever teeth <b>482</b> to lock the knob <b>404</b> at that particular location. However, such a correspondence between the winding increments and the locking increments is not crucial to the present invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0237">The lock teeth <b>482</b> and knob teeth <b>484</b> are preferably configured to allow rotation of the knob <b>404</b> in a tightening direction without interference between the respective teeth <b>482</b>, <b>484</b>. However, the teeth <b>482</b>, <b>484</b> are configured to inhibit rotation of the knob <b>404</b> in a loosening direction by interference between the lock teeth <b>482</b> and knob teeth <b>484</b>. Thus, in order to rotate the knob <b>404</b> in a counterclockwise direction and release the spool <b>426</b>, the lever <b>470</b> must be depressed, thereby separating the lock teeth <b>182</b> and knob teeth <b>484</b>. Only then can the knob <b>404</b> be rotated counterclockwise to release the spool <b>426</b>, as described above.</p>
    <p num="p-0238">With particular reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> and additionally to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, an alternative embodiment comprises a knob <b>404</b> configured with a knob insert, or rotatable actuator <b>460</b>, that rotates independently of the knob <b>404</b>. For example, the knob <b>404</b> is configured with one or more arc grooves <b>480</b> configured to receive the protrusions <b>454</b> of the rotatable actuator. The arc grooves <b>480</b> and protrusions <b>454</b> can cooperate to securely attach the actuator <b>460</b> to the knob <b>404</b>, yet still allow relative rotation therebetween. The actuator <b>460</b> is configured with one or more upwardly extending tabs <b>482</b> that allow a user to grip and rotate the actuator <b>460</b> independently of the knob <b>404</b>. Moreover, the rotatable actuator <b>460</b> carries one or more ramps <b>456</b> on its lower surface, as discussed above, that interact with the pawl spring <b>440</b> to effectuate a release of the spool pawls <b>452</b> from the spool teeth <b>428</b>, as also described above. One or more alignment holes <b>484</b> may be provided through the actuator <b>460</b> to allow a user to visually verify the locked or unlocked status of the spool. For example, holes <b>484</b> can be located through the actuator <b>460</b> and the knob <b>404</b> can be configured with a visual indicator, such as one or more colored dots <b>485</b>. The colored dots <b>485</b> are preferably located such that when the actuator <b>460</b> is positioned to lock the spool <b>426</b> one color is viewable through the holes <b>484</b>, and when the actuator <b>460</b> is positioned to unlock the spool <b>426</b> a different color is viewable through the holes <b>484</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0239">In order to release the spool <b>426</b> and unwind the laces, a user simply rotates either the knob <b>404</b> or actuator, depending on the particular embodiment, in a counterclockwise direction thus causing the ramps <b>456</b> to engage and deflect the spool pawls <b>452</b> outwardly, thereby allowing the spool <b>426</b> to unwind the tensioned laces. Thus, a safety mechanism is provided that inhibits unintentional and accidental loosing of the reel and lace. Of course, it is to be understood that a counterclockwise rotation is not the only direction of rotation that can release the spool. In some embodiments, a right reel is tightened by rotating the knob in a clockwise direction and the spool is released by rotating the knob in a counterclockwise direction; and a left reel is tightened by rotating the knob in a counterclockwise direction and the spool is released by rotating the knob in a clockwise direction.</p>
    <p num="p-0240">Therefore, a right reel and a left reel can be configured for opposite directional rotation to allow a user to more naturally grip and manipulate the reel. It is currently believed that an overhand motion, e.g. a clockwise rotation with a person's right hand, is a more natural motion and can provide a greater torque to tighten the reel. Therefore, by configuring a right and left reel for opposite rotation, each reel is configured to be tightened with an overhand motion by tightening the right reel with the right hand, and tightening the left reel with the left hand.</p>
    <p num="p-0241">In several of the above described embodiments, the lace includes two free ends that can be inserted and fixed within the spool <b>426</b>. One particular advantage of these embodiments is that the lace can be removed and replaced, such as by threading through the guide members and inserted and affixed into the spool <b>426</b>, as necessary, without having to replace any ancillary components. However, other embodiments provide a closed loop lace which is permanently engaged with the spool <b>426</b>. In these embodiments, a removable spool and lace unit allows replacement of the spool and lace assembly as a unit. Such a replaceable spool and lace does not require subsequent threading of the lace through the guide members or the outer housing, and further does not require steps to secure the lace within the spool <b>426</b>, thus making lace replacement a fast and efficient process. However, in order to effectuate such a replacement, a closed loop lace must be able to enter the guide members without having a free end to thread through a tubular guide member.</p>
    <p num="p-0242">To this end, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>42</b> <i>b </i>illustrate one embodiment of a guide member <b>490</b> especially suited to accept a closed loop lace. When referring to the term “closed loop lace,” it should be interpreted to mean a lace that enters the spool <b>426</b> at two or more locations, whether it has two free ends affixed within the spool <b>426</b>, or is a truly continuous lace having no ends.</p>
    <p num="p-0243">In this embodiment of a guide member <b>490</b>, rather than having a tubular lace guide, the guide members comprise a lace guide <b>491</b> defining an open channel <b>492</b> having, for example, a semicircular, “C” shaped, or “U” shaped cross section. The guide member <b>490</b> is preferably mounted on the boot or shoe such that the channel opening <b>494</b> faces away from the midline of the boot, so that a lace under tension will be retained therein. One or more retention strips, stitches or flaps may be provided for “closing” the channel opening <b>494</b> to prevent the lace from escaping when tension on the lace is released. The axial length of the channel can be preformed in a generally U configuration. Moreover, practically any axial configuration of the guide member <b>490</b> is possible, and is mainly dictated by fashion, and only partly by function.</p>
    <p num="p-0244">Several guide members <b>490</b> may be molded as a single piece, such as several lace guides <b>491</b> molded to a common backing support strip which can be adhered or stitched to the shoe. Thus, a right lace guide member and a left lace guide member can be secured to opposing portions of the top or sides of the shoe to provide a right set of guide channels <b>492</b> and a left set of guide channels <b>492</b>. When referring to “right” and “left” guide members, this should not be construed as suggesting a mounting location of the retainer strips. For example, the guide members <b>490</b> can be located on a single side of the shoe, such as in a shoe having a vamp that extends generally from one side of the shoe, across the midline of the foot, and is secured by laces on the opposing side of the shoe. In this type of shoe, the guide members <b>490</b> are actually disposed vertically with respect to one another, and hence, a left and right guide member merely refers to the fact that the guide members <b>490</b> have openings that face one another, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0245">When changing a worn or broken lace, a user simply removes the knob <b>404</b>, such as by removing an axial mounting screw extending through the knob <b>404</b> and into the spool <b>426</b>. Additionally, a screw extending through the base member <b>402</b> and into the spool <b>426</b> may also require removal before the spool <b>426</b> can be removed. Once the appropriate fasteners are removed, the entire spool <b>426</b> with concomitant lace can be removed and a new spool <b>426</b> and lace unit can be inserted in place. In order to accommodate this type of closed loop lace, not only must the guide members be open channeled, but the guides of the outer housing <b>400</b> must likewise comprise open channels to allow removal and insertion of a closed loop lace.</p>
    <p num="p-0246">With returning reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 34</figref>, the base member <b>402</b> incorporates lace guides <b>422</b> having an open channel. The base member <b>402</b> has a generally C-shaped channel into which the lace may be inserted or removed. As described above, the channel <b>492</b> may selectively be closed by a flap or other closure device for maintaining the lace within the channel when not under tension. A tension applied to the lace will maintain it within the channel.</p>
    <p num="p-0247">As described above, the base member <b>402</b> may contain a mounting <b>406</b> flange adapted for fastening to a shoe or boot. The mounting flange <b>406</b> can be configured with ridges <b>496</b> or grooves to offer increased frictional holding between the flange portion and connected material. Moreover, grooves can offer a decreased thickness to facilitate puncture, such as for stitching, yet offer an increased thickness to inhibit pull through of the stitching. Ridges or ribs can function in a similar manner to provide an area of increased thickness to increase the flange resistance to stitching pull through pressures. Of course, the base member <b>402</b> can be mounted to the footwear in any suitable manner, such as through adhesives, fasteners, mechanical or chemical bonding, mechanical structure, and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0248">While the function of the embodiments disclosed in relation to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 34</figref> is substantially similar, it should be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that great artistic license can be taken with the design of the outer housing to appease the whims of the fashion conscious.</p>
    <p num="p-0249"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43 and 44</figref> illustrate examplary embodiments and mounting configurations of the present footwear-lacing system. For example, a plurality of guide members <b>490</b> can be located in lieu of traditional shoe eyelet strips, as described above. Typically, the guide members <b>490</b> are installed as opposing pairs, with the guide members formed integrally with the reel <b>498</b> typically comprising one of the guide members. The term “reel” will be used hereinafter to refer to the various embodiments including the complete structure of the outer housing and its internal components, unless otherwise specified. Thus, in some embodiments, there are 2, 4, 6, or 8 or more cooperating guide members <b>490</b> installed to define a lace path. Moreover, a non-paired guide member <b>490</b> can be installed, such as toward the toe of the shoe and positioned transverse to the midline and having its lace openings directed toward the heel of the shoe. This configuration, in addition to applying tightening forces between the lateral and medial sides of the shoe, would also apply a lace tension force along the midline of the shoe. Of course, other numbers and arrangements of guide members can be provided and this application and its claims should not be limited to only configurations utilizing opposing or even paired guide members.</p>
    <p num="p-0250"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref> shows an embodiment in which the reel <b>498</b> is located on the lateral quarter panel of the shoe. Of course, the reel <b>498</b> can be located practically anywhere on the shoe and only some of the preferred locations are described herein. Moreover, the illustrated reel can be any reel embodiment suitable for practicing the present invention, and should not be limited to one particular embodiment. The illustrated embodiment provides three guide members <b>490</b> spaced along the gap between the medial quarter panel <b>500</b> and lateral quarter panels <b>502</b> of the shoe and thus creates a lace path that zigzags across the tongue <b>504</b> . While the reel <b>498</b> is illustrated as being disposed on the lateral quarter <b>502</b> panel near the ankle, it may also be disposed on the medial quarter panel <b>500</b> of the shoe. In some embodiments, the reel <b>498</b> is disposed on the same quarter panel of each shoe, for example, the reel can be mounted on the lateral quarter panel <b>502</b> of each shoe, or in alternative embodiments, the reel can be disposed on the lateral quarter panel <b>502</b> of one shoe, and on the medial quarter panel <b>500</b> of the other shoe.</p>
    <p num="p-0251">Notably, this particular embodiment has a lace path that forms an acute angle a as it enters the outer housing. As discussed above, a lace guide member can be integrally formed into the outer housing to direct the lace to approach and interact with the reel from substantially diametrical directions. Thus, the summation of tension forces applied to the reel are substantially cancelled.</p>
    <p num="p-0252"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref> shows an alternative embodiment of a shoe incorporating a vamp closure structure. In this particular embodiment, the reel <b>498</b> can be disposed on the vamp <b>506</b>, as illustrated, or can be disposed on the lateral quarter panel, or even in the heel, as disclosed above. Similar to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>, the reel illustrated in this <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref> should not be limited to one specific embodiment, but should be understood to be any suitable embodiment of a reel for use with the disclosed invention. In the illustrated embodiment, three lace guides <b>490</b> are affixed to the shoe; two on the lateral quarter panel <b>502</b>, and one on the vamp <b>506</b> cooperating with the guide members integrally formed with the reel <b>498</b> to define a lace path between the lateral quarter panel <b>502</b> and the vamp <b>506</b>. Those of ordinary skill will appreciate that the guide members can be spaced appropriately to result in various tightening strategies.</p>
    <p num="p-0253">For example, the opposing guide members <b>490</b> can be spaced a greater distance apart to allow a greater range of tightening. More specifically, by further separating the opposing guide members <b>490</b>, there is a greater distance that can be used to effectuate tightening before the guide members <b>490</b> bottom out. This embodiment offers the additional advantage of extending the lace <b>23</b> over a substantially planar portion of the shoe, rather than across a portion of the shoe having a convex curvature thereto.</p>
    <p num="p-0254"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref> illustrates an alternative arrangement of a shoe incorporating a vamp closing structure and having a reel and a non-looping lace. In this particular embodiment, an open ended lace can be attached directly to a portion of the shoe. As illustrated, a reel <b>498</b> is mounted on the lateral quarter panel <b>502</b> of the shoe. The shoe has one or more lace guides <b>490</b> strategically positioned thereon. As illustrated, one lace guide <b>490</b> is mounted on the vamp <b>506</b> while a second lace guide <b>498</b> is mounted on the lateral quarter panel <b>502</b>. A lace has one end connected to a spool within the reel <b>498</b> and extends from the reel <b>498</b>, through the lace guides <b>490</b> and is attached directly to the shoe by any suitable connection <b>512</b>. One suitable location for attaching the lace is on the vamp toward the toe for those embodiments in which the reel <b>498</b> is mounted on the lateral quarter panel <b>502</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0255">The connection <b>512</b> may be a permanent connection or may be releasable to allow the lace to be removed and replaced as necessary. The connection is preferably a suitable releasable mechanical connection, such as a clip, clamp, or screw, for example. Other types of mechanical connections, adhesive bonding, or chemical bonding may also be used to attach a lace end to the shoe.</p>
    <p num="p-0256">While the illustrated embodiment shows the reel <b>498</b> attached to the lateral quarter panel <b>502</b>, it should be apparent that the reel <b>498</b> could readily be attached to the vamp <b>506</b> and still provide the beneficial features disclosed herein. Additionally, the lace could optionally be attached to the shoe on the lateral quarter panel <b>502</b> rather than the vamp <b>506</b>. The reel <b>498</b> and lace could be attached to a common portion of the shoe, or may be attached to different portions of the shoe, as illustrated. In any case, as the lace is tightened around the spool, the lace tension draws the guide members toward each other and tightens the footwear around a wearer's foot.</p>
    <p num="p-0257">A shoe is typically curved across the midline to accommodate the dorsal anatomy of a human foot. Therefore, in an embodiment in which the laces zigzag across the midline of the shoe, the further the lace guides <b>490</b> are spaced, the closer the laces <b>23</b> are to the sole <b>510</b> of the shoe. Consequently, as the laces <b>23</b> tighten, a straight line between the lace guides <b>490</b> is obstructed by the midline of the shoe, which can result in a substantial pressure to the tongue of the shoe and further result in discomfort to the wearer and increased chaffing and wearing of the tongue. Therefore, by locating the laces <b>23</b> across a substantially flat surface on either the lateral or medial portion of the shoe, as illustrated, the laces <b>23</b> can be increasingly tightened without imparting pressure to other portions of the shoe.</p>
    <p num="p-0258">It is contemplated that some embodiments of the lacing system <b>22</b> discussed herein will be incorporated into athletic footwear and other sports gear that is prone to impact. Such examples include bicycle shoes, ski or snowboard boots, and protective athletic equipment, among others. Accordingly, it is preferable to protect the reel from inadvertent releasing of the spool and lace by impact with external objects.</p>
    <p num="p-0259"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 46 and 47</figref> illustrate a lacing system <b>22</b> further having a protective element to protect the reel from impact from external objects. In one embodiment, the protective element is a shield <b>514</b> comprised of one or more raised ridges <b>516</b> or ramps configured to extend away from the mounting flange <b>406</b> a distance sufficiently high to protect the otherwise exposed reel. In the illustrated embodiment, the shield <b>514</b> is configured to slope toward the reel thus presenting an oblique surface to any objects it may contact to deflect the objects away from the reel. The shield <b>514</b> is positioned around the reel circumferentially and slopes radially toward the reel and may encircle the reel, or may be positioned around half the reel, a quarter of the reel, or any suitable portion or portions of the reel.</p>
    <p num="p-0260">The shield <b>514</b> may be integrally formed with the mounting flange <b>406</b>, such as during molding, or may be formed as a separate piece and subsequently attached to the lacing system <b>22</b> such as by adhesives or other suitable bonding techniques. It is preferable that the shield <b>514</b> is formed of a material exhibiting a sufficient hardness to withstand repeated impacts without plastically deforming or showing undue signs of wear.</p>
    <p num="p-0261">Another embodiment of a protective element is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>. In this embodiment, a shield <b>514</b> is in the form of a raised lip <b>517</b> that encircles a portion of the circumference of the knob (not shown). The lip <b>517</b> can be of sufficient height to exceed the top of the knob, or can extend to just below the height of the knob to allow a user to still grasp the knob above the lip <b>517</b>, or the lip <b>517</b> can be formed with varying heights. The lip <b>517</b> is preferably designed to withstand impact from various objects to thereby protect the knob from being inadvertently rotated and/or displaced axially.</p>
    <p num="p-0262">The lip <b>517</b> can be integrally molded with the mounting flange, or can be a separate piece. In addition, the lip <b>517</b> can take on various shapes and dimensions to satisfy aesthetic tastes while still providing the protective function it has been designed for. For example, it can be formed with various draft angles, heights, bottom fillets, of varying materials and the like. In the illustrated embodiment, the lip <b>517</b> extends substantially around the entire circumference of the knob <b>498</b>, except at holds <b>521</b> where the lip <b>517</b> recedes sufficiently to allow a user to grasp a large portion of the knob's height to be able to displace the knob axially by lifting it away from the housing. The illustrated embodiment additionally shows that the lip <b>517</b> extends outward to protect a substantial portion of the knob's height. While the lip <b>517</b> is illustrated as extending around a particular portion of the knob's circumference, it can of course extend around more or less of the knob's circumference. Certain preferred embodiments integrate a continuous shield <b>514</b> extending around between a quarter and a half of the knob circumference, while other embodiments incorporate a shield <b>514</b> comprising one or more discrete portions that combine to cover any appropriate range about the circumference of the knob. Of course, other protective elements or shields <b>514</b> could be incorporated to protect the reel, such as a protective covering or cap to cover the reel, a cage structure that fits over the reel, and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0263">As discussed above, the lace <b>23</b> is preferably a highly lubricious cable or fiber having a low modulus of elasticity and a high tensile strength. While any suitable lace may be used, certain preferred embodiments utilize a lace formed from extended chain, high modulus polyethylene fibers. One example of a suitable lace material is sold under the trade name SPECTRA™, manufactured by Honeywell of Morris Township, N.J. The extended chain, high modulus polyethylene fibers advantageously have a high strength to weight ratio, are cut resistant, and have very low elasticity. One preferred lace made of this material is tightly woven. The tight weave provides added stiffness to the completed lace. The additional stiffness provided by the weave offers enhanced pushability, such that the lace is easily threaded through the lace guides, and into the reel and spool.</p>
    <p num="p-0264">The lace made of high modulus polyethylene fibers is additionally preferred for its strength to diameter ratio. A small lace diameter allows for a small reel. In some embodiments, the lace has a diameter within the range of from about 0.010″ to about 0.050″, or preferably from about 0.020″ to about 0.030″, and in one embodiment, has a diameter of 0.025″. Of course, other types of laces, including those formed of textile, polymeric, or metallic materials, may be suitable for use with the present footwear lacing system as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art in light of the disclosure herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0265">Another preferred lace is formed of a high modulus polyethylene fiber, nylon or other synthetic material and has a rectangular cross-section. This cross-sectional shape can be formed by weaving the lace material as a flat ribbon, a tube, or other suitable configuration. In any case the lace will substantially flatten and present a larger surface area than a cable or other similar lace and will thereby reduce wear and abrasion against the lace guides and other footwear hardware. In addition, there is a sufficient amount of cross-sectional material to provide an adequate tension strength, while still allowing the lace to maintain a sufficiently thin profile to be efficiently wound around a spool. The thin profile of the lace advantageously allows the spool to remain small while still providing the capacity to receive a sufficient length of lace. Of course, the laces disclosed herein are only exemplary of any of a wide number of different types and configurations of laces that are suitable to be used with the lacing system described herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0266">Although this invention has been disclosed in the context of certain preferred embodiments and examples, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention extends beyond the specifically disclosed embodiments to other alternative embodiments and/or uses of the invention and obvious modifications and equivalents thereof. In addition, while a number of variations of the invention have been shown and described in detail, other modifications, which are within the scope of this invention, will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art based upon this disclosure. It is also contemplated that various combinations or subcombinations of the specific features and aspects of the embodiments may be made and still fall within the scope of the invention. Accordingly, it should be understood that various features and aspects of the disclosed embodiments can be combined with or substituted for one another in order to form varying modes of the disclosed invention. Thus, it is intended that the scope of the present invention herein disclosed should not be limited by the particular disclosed embodiments described above, but should be determined only by a fair reading of the claims that follow.</p>
