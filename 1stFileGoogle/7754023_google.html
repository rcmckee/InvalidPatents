    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0002">The present invention relates to compositions and methods for paint overspray removal processes.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">Automatic spraying techniques have long been employed for painting large articles such as cars, trucks, refrigerators, etc. The items being sprayed are generally advanced along a conveyor line that passes through a water wash paint spray booth where a fine spray of paint is directed at the articles being painted from spray guns that are located at the sides of the conveyor. Overspray paint, that is, paint that does not contact the article being painted, forms a fine mist of paint in the air space surrounding the painted article. This paint mist must be removed from the air. To accomplish this, the contaminated air is pulled through the paint spray booth by air exhaust fans. A curtain of circulating water is maintained across the path of the air in a manner such that the air must pass through the water curtain to reach the exhaust fans. As the air passes through the water curtain, the paint mist is “scrubbed” from the air and carried to a sump basin usually located below the paint spray booth. In this area, the paint particles are separated from the water so that the water may be recycled and the paint particles disposed of.</p>
    <p num="p-0004">Paint is a tacky material and it tends to coagulate and adhere to the spray booth surfaces, particularly in the sump and drain areas, and must constantly be removed from the sump to prevent clogging of the sump drain and recirculating system. In order to assist in the removal of the oversprayed paint from the air and to provide efficient operation of paint spray booths, detackifying agents are commonly employed in the water used in such systems, and are typically incorporated into the water wash recirculated in the paint spray system. Detackifying the paint eliminates or minimizes the adhesive properties, or tackiness, of the paint, thereby preventing the oversprayed paint from adhering to surfaces, such as sump and drain areas.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">One of the difficulties with recovering paint overspray in a water wash spray booth as described above is the limited amount of paint that can be incorporated into the water. As such, detackifying agents should have a high load capacity, such that the water wash recirculated through the spray booth can detackify, coagulate and flocculate a high volume of oversprayed paint before exhaustion.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">In recent years, the need to reduce solvent emission has resulted in the reduction of solvent-based or solventborne paints, and an increase in the use of water-based or waterborne paints. Because the hydrophilic properties of the waterborne coating compositions render such compositions readily dispersible or soluble in water, removal of paint solids comprised of components such as organic resins, pigments, and organic solvents, from waterborne paint overspray typically requires the use of different detackifying processes in paint spray booths when compared to solvent-based paints.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">Accordingly, further improvements would be a welcome addition to the art, wherein compositions and methods useful for removal of paint overspray from both waterborne and solvent-based paints are employed to effectively decrease the amount of one or more of organic resins, pigments, and organic solvents in paint spray booths.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0008">The present invention includes methods and compositions for the removal of paint overspray in paint spray booths, the paint overspray containing a paint solids portion and, optionally, an organic solvents portion, the paint solids portion including organic resins and, optionally, pigments. The method comprises contacting the paint overspray with a wash water system comprising an agitated solution comprising a microorganism concentrate so as to collect the paint overspray in the agitated solution; passing the solution containing the paint overspray to a holding area for phase separation into an organic phase containing paint overspray and an aqueous phase; and separating the organic phase containing the paint overspray, which contains the paint solids portion, that includes organic resins and, optionally, pigments, and, optionally, an organic solvents portion, is separated from the aqueous phase.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">In another embodiment of the present invention the method for treating overspray paints is similar to the method described immediately above, and further includes treating the organic phase to separate at least a portion of the paint solids from the organic solvent portion, dispersing the organic solvent portion with the agitated solution for subsequent contact with the paint overspray, and recovering the paint solids.</p>

    <p num="p-0065">Additionally, other compounds may be included in the composition of the present invention to act as co-flocculants. Useful compounds include amine group-containing polymers, for example, acrylamide polymers, particularly cationic acrylamide polymers.

    <p num="p-0066">The coagulant of the present invention is typically prepared by combining the coagulant and water optionally in the presence of an acid, and mixing at a temperature and for a time sufficient to form an aqueous solution of the coagulant.</p>
    <p num="p-0067">After formation of the aqueous solution of the coagulant, a portion of this aqueous solution typically is combined with additional water. The complex metal salt, if present, can then be added to the solution, with gentle stirring, to form the coagulant solution.

    <p num="p-0069">The water system including the coagulant solution therein typically is maintained at a pH between 6 to 10, such as between 6.5 and 8.0. Because the coagulant solution of the present invention may, in some embodiments, be slightly acidic, the use of the composition in a recirculating water system may affect the pH of the system. Accordingly, the pH of the water system may be adjusted as is known in the art. For example, small increments of liquid caustic soda, i.e., 50% NaOH, may be added to the water system to maintain the pH in the desired range. Such liquid caustic soda may, for example, be added to the water system in a proportion of 0.05 to 1.5 ml liquid caustic soda per 10 ml of wash water.</p>
    <p num="p-0070">The microorganism concentrate of the present invention may be prepared in the form of a liquid concentrate, which is intended for addition to water systems for use in paint spray booths. As such, the concentrate can be added to a volume of wash water which is recirculated through a paint spray booth as an initial detackifying additive, and also can be added as a maintenance detackifying additive during operation of the paint spray booth, as will be discussed in more detail herein.</p>

Volume percent, as used herein, is based on total volume of organisms present in the microorganism concentrate. The volumetric concentration of microorganisms ranges from 10<sup>7 </sup>to 10<sup>9 </sup>colony forming units (cfu) per milliliter (ml) of solution. For example, a 20 volume percent solution of bacterial organisms in water would comprise 20 liters 10<sup>7 </sup>to 10<sup>9 </sup>cfu per ml bacterial organisms and 80 liters water.</p>
    <p num="p-0073">As previously mentioned, in accordance with the method of the present invention, oversprayed paint particles in a paint spray booth are treated with a circulating water system comprising a microorganism concentrate, as described above. The microorganism concentrate of the present invention as discussed above may be added to the wash water system of the paint spray booth in any manner known to those of skill in the art. For example, the microorganism concentrate of the present invention may be added directly into the spray booth wash water. The circulating wash water system forms a continuous moving water curtain that scrubs an air flow containing paint overspray so as to collect the paint overspray in the water curtain. Paint spray booths containing continuous curtains of water to scrub air flows containing paint overspray are known in the art, for example U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,030, which discloses typical paint spray booths.</p>
    <p num="p-0074">In operation, an object to be painted is placed within the paint spray booth, and is painted using known spray techniques. The overspray paint is contacted with the continuous curtains of water that is pumped through the paint spray booth in known manner. Such contacting of the overspray paint with the wash water system comprising a microorganism concentrate of the present invention causes the paint to flocculate and separate from the wash water, thereby forming a sludge layer on/in the wash water system that is circulated through the paint spray booth. In addition, the microorganism concentrate of the present invention also can detackify the flocculated paint. The amount of the flocculated paint sludge in the water solution is monitored and removed periodically, through known methods.</p>
    <p num="p-0075">The effectiveness of the microorganism concentrate is also periodically monitored during operation of the paint spray booth. This may be accomplished by monitoring the tackiness of the paint sludge removed from the paint spray booth. Alternatively, the level of the microorganism concentrate may be monitored to maintain a desired predetermined threshold level of these materials within the wash water. When the wash water fails to effectively detackify the oversprayed paint and/or when the level of the microorganism concentrate drops below a desired predetermined threshold level, a maintenance dosage of the microorganism concentrate of the present invention may be added to the recirculating water, thereby maintaining the effectiveness of the paint spray booth.</p>
    <p num="p-0076">It should be understood that the microorganism concentrate of the present invention may be used in any of the paint overspray treatment systems known in the industry. For example, the microorganism concentrate is also suitable for use in dispersion/emulsion paint overspray treatment systems such as those that contain a carbonyl compound selected from 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol monoisobutyrate, 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanedioldiisobutyrate isobutyrate, or a mixture thereof. Examples of such systems are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,198,143; 5,200,104; and 5,464,556.</p>
    <p num="p-0077">The microorganism concentrate of the present invention is used in a similar manner when used in connection with either waterborne and solvent-based paint denaturant systems. An example of such a system is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,141, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Such paint denaturant systems may include in the wash water a dispersion of an organic solvent component in water. The microorganism concentrate of the present invention may be added to the wash water containing such dispersion.</p>
    <p num="p-0078">More particularly, the organic solvent component may comprise a single organic solvent or a mixture of organic solvents. Examples of organic solvents useful include alkyl esters of polycarboxylic acids or mixtures of such esters, such as dimethyl adipate, dimethyl glutarate, dimethyl succinate or a mixture thereof; diisobutyl adipate, diisobutyl glutarate, diisobutyl succinate or a mixture thereof.</p>
    <p num="p-0079">The organic solvent component that may be used in the method of the invention may have a solubility in water of less than 15 percent, particularly from 1 to 5 percent by weight, and in which the water may be soluble to an extent of less than 15 percent, particularly from 1 to 5 percent by weight; the percentages by weight being based on total weight of water and organic solvent.</p>
    <p num="p-0080">Besides the solubility characteristics described above, the organic solvent component may have a specific gravity sufficiently higher or lower than water to facilitate separation of the organic phase from the aqueous phase. Typically, the specific gravity of the organic solvent component is either less than 0.98 or greater than 1.02, particularly from 0.90 to 0.95 or 1.05 to 1.10.</p>
    <p num="p-0081">In addition to the solubility and specific gravity properties, the organic solvent component may have a vapor pressure less than 0.1 millimeters of mercury. Low vapor pressures are desirable because less volatile organic content is released to the atmosphere due to evaporation.</p>
    <p num="p-0082">As previously mentioned, the organic solvent component (when present) can comprise a single organic solvent or a mixture of organic solvents. Examples of organic solvents which are usable in the method of the invention include alkyl esters of polycarboxylic acids or mixtures of such esters. Typically, these esters are of the following structural formula:</p>

    <p num="p-0087">The organic solvent component can be dispersed into the wash water system by simply adding it to the circulating water in a typical water wash spray booth. The microorganism concentrate of the present invention may also be added into the wash water in a similar manner. The pumping and circulation action associated with the spray booth ensures that the organic solvent component will be stably dispersed in the aqueous medium, and ensures that the microorganism concentrate will remain properly mixed in the aqueous medium.</p>
    <p num="p-0088">The paint overspray typically contains pigments, organic resins and organic solvent associated with industrial paints. Typical paints are acrylic-based paints, urethane-based paints, base coat/clear coat paints and high solids paints which are used in the automotive, appliance and general industrial markets.</p>
    <p num="p-0089">As described above, the paint overspray is contacted with the continuous curtain of wash water that is pumped through the paint spray booth. Paint spray booths containing continuous curtains of wash water to scrub air flows containing paint overspray are know in the art and will not be further described here. Reference is made, however, to U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,030 which discloses typical paint spray booths. Such contacting of the paint overspray with the solution that may include the organic solvent in water and the microorganism concentrate of the present invention collects the paint overspray in the solution.</p>
    <p num="p-0090">The solution that contains the paint overspray is pumped through the system in any known manner to a holding area, such as to a sludge tank, from where paint overspray can optionally be removed. The solution can be returned to the paint spray booth to collect additional paint overspray. The continuous circulation and pumping action keeps the solution agitated and stable. In certain embodiments, mechanical means may be employed to remove the paint sludge (which includes paint solids, and possibly organic solvents) from the wash water system. In other embodiments, this holding area may be relatively free of agitation so as to cause the solution to spontaneously phase separate into an organic phase and an aqueous phase. The organic phase that contains most if not all of the paint overspray is separated from the aqueous phase. The paint sludge can optionally be removed from the wash water system.</p>
    <p num="p-0091">The inclusion of the aqueous solution of coagulant solution facilitates partial demulsification of the paint overspray from the aqueous phase and imparts a capacity to reduce dispersion of the solvent layer (if present), and decreases the time for phase separation. It is also contemplated that at the holding tank, at least a portion of the aqueous phase from this area may be removed so that the coagulant solution may be added thereto for recirculation to the spray booth.</p>
    <p num="p-0092">The organic phase may be further separated into an organic solvent portion and a portion that contains paint solids that comprise organic resin and, optionally, pigment. Typical separating units can include, for example a distillation column, a thin film evaporator or a centrifuge. The organic solvent portion (which contains the organic solvent component initially used to formulate the solution as well as at least a portion of the organic solvent component associated with the paint) is recovered in either the distillate or centrifugate, and may be returned to the recirculating system, where it can be readily dispersed. The paint solids as separated may be reclaimed for further use or may be disposed of. Because the paint is uncured, it can be used as curable filler in adhesives or in paints.</p>
    <p num="p-0093">The microorganism concentrate of the present invention may be employed in wash water systems to aid in the removal of paint overspray from paint spray booths. The microorganism concentrates of the present invention have been found to be particularly useful for removal of waterborne paint overspray from spray booths.</p>

    <p num="p-0096">A microorganism concentrate of &gt;10<sup>7 </sup>per mL of <i>Bacillus </i>sp. organism, commercially available from Harvard Chemical Research, Atlanta, Ga., as S-29 10X, was used. Ten (10) mL of this microorganism concentrate was incorporated into the recirculation system of a paint spray booth similar to those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,116,514. In particular, the recirculation system was charged with an amount so as to provide the recirculation system with a level of 500 parts per million (500 ppm) of the microorganism concentrate. 0.3 mL of a 50% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide was added to adjust the pH of the system. The pH of the system was measured as 9.0, and the temperature was 70° F.</p>
    <p num="p-0097">The recirculation system in the paint spray booth was then turned on. The paint spray booth was used to spray a clearcoat coating available from PPG Industries, Inc., as DCT5002H Diamond Coat® clearcoat. 100 mL of clearcoat was sprayed at a rate of 2 mL per minute into the paint spray system.</p>
    <p num="p-0098">During spraying, the recirculation system including the microorganism concentrate had a moderate detackifying effect on the paint. The paint slightly re-livened when rolled between the fingers. The entire amount of clearcoat (100 mL) was sprayed into the recirculation system without failure, failure indicated by livened or sticky paint present in the apparatus.</p>

S-29 10X microorganism concentrate described in Example 1 (250 ppm) together with 5 mL of a chitosan/aluminum chlorohydrate solution (250 ppm) prepared as discussed in Example 7. The recirculator water was adjusted to a pH of 8.5 by the addition of 0.4 mL of a 50% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide.</p>
    <p num="p-0114">36 mL of PPG DCT5002H Diamond Coat® clearcoat (available from PPG Industries, Inc.) was sprayed into the recirculator resulting in excellent detackification (see description from Table 1 of Example 1).</p>
    <p num="p-0115">Next, the recirculator was charged with 10 mL of HWB 83542 White Waterborne Basecoat (commercially available from PPG Industries, Inc.). This paint immediately coagulated upon introduction to the solution and was further agglomerated upon the addition of 5 mL of 0.5% inversion of a cationic polyacrylamide flocculant (available from PPG Industries, Inc. as PPG BCTL2100).</p>
