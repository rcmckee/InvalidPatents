<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0006">The present invention relates to a system <b>500</b> implementing a MDB TRANSACTION STRING in memory to effectuate cashless vending. The MDB TRANSACTION STRING allows the system <b>500</b> and or computing platform <b>802</b> to manage cashless vending by monitoring data fields within the MDB TRANSACTION STRING.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">The MDB TRANSACTION STRING is constructed and managed in system <b>500</b> memory. The MDB TRANSACTION STRING includes at least one of the following data fields a VEND STATE field, a MAX VEND SALE field, a SALE PRICE field, a COLUMN field, or a VEND FLAG field.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">In operation, the system <b>500</b> obtains data from a vending machine and constructs and manages an MDB TRANSACTION STRING in memory. Utilization of the MDB TRANSACTION STRING occurs when the system <b>500</b> application code and or a computing platform <b>802</b> interconnected with the system <b>500</b> reads the MDB TRANSACTION STRING to make certain determinations to effectuate cashless vending.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">In addition, the present invention relates to a system and method that is scalable and configurable to include interfaces for vending equipment monitoring and control capabilities, interfaces for a card reader device and other identification devices to obtain payment identification data to be used for payment of goods and or services vended, an interactive interface and protocol for interconnecting the system to a computing platform, support for a plurality of communication options that include wired, point-to-point wireless, and wireless networking including LAN/WAN/WCDMA/CDMA/CDPD/2G/2.5G/ and 3G solutions.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">Furthermore, the present invention also relates to a system and method of effectuating remote monitoring of vending equipment by gathering DEX and MDB audit data from the vending equipment, and data communicating with a plurality of remote locations, wherein a plurality of remote locations can be a plurality of global network based data processing resources.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">Recent trends in the vending industry have been to offer higher priced items out of vending equipment at traditionally unattended vending locations. Higher priced item offers can result from the desire to vend larger portions of products such as the twenty-ounce soda bottle verse the twelve-ounce soda can. In other cases the higher priced items can be items that until recently my not have been consider for sale through vending equipment such as phone cards, disposable cameras, and frozen food entrees to name a few.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">The vending industry's desire to vend higher priced items has given rise to issues related to currency and inventory. For example, with the shift to vending twenty-ounce bottles many of the vending sales now involve more that one currency note, as an example two one-dollar bills to make a purchase. As a result the bill validator can fill to capacity with currency notes before all the items in the vending equipment have been sold. With a bill acceptor filled to capacity the vending equipment may not be able to transact another vending sale and place itself out-of-service. As a result vending operators can typically find themselves restocking vending equipment that still has product available for sale but because of the inability to take additional currency notes the vending equipment could not sell the inventory.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">In addition, with many beverage type vending machines the shift from the twelve-ounce can to the twenty-ounce bottle can create coin mechanism issues. In moving to the larger size beverage the average price can move from typically slightly less than a dollar where little change was required when a dollar note was used for payment to slightly more than a dollar where the better part of a dollar in change can be required when two one-dollar notes are used for payment for a vend. Resultant from this price move not only do the bill validators fill to capacity faster and stop working sooner, but the coin mechanism can be required to supply a customer with more change on each vend depleting a coin mechanism coin supply faster. Once the coin change supply is depleted the vending machine may be rendered out-of-service.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">In addition to the new burden on bill acceptors and coin mechanisms resultant from the sale of higher priced items other issues related to the vending of higher priced items can arise. One such issue can be that a customer may not have enough money on-hand to effectuate the vending purchase. In the case of phone cards, cameras, and frozen food vend prices may range from several dollars to forty dollars, fifty dollars, or more. In many cases the customer may have the desire to purchase the high priced item but simply lacks the amount of currency required to effectuate the purchase. In other cases the customer may be reluctant to trust the vend worthiness of the vending equipment with what the customer considers to be a significant amount of money.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">As the proliferation of higher priced vend items continues to become more pervasive in today's society the vending industry has become increasingly concerned about tracking inventory and monitoring the operational status of the vending equipment remotely. It is considered a general belief within the vending industry that remotely monitoring vending equipment can optimize a route driver's daily activity and reduce operational costs associated with the sales and delivery of products to the vending equipment.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">To date auditing devices have been designed to be placed inside the vending equipment or held in the hand of a route collector for the purpose of gathering vending equipment inventory and operational data which can later be downloaded to a computer. These devices however have been costly to manufacture, install, maintain, and operate. As such the total cost of the technology verse the savings on the operational costs associated with the sales and delivery of products to date have not made for a sound or compelling business model. As a result the vending industry has been slow to adopt ‘audit’ only technology.</p>
  <p num="p-0017">The cost benefit model of the ‘audit’ hardware may not be the only issue hampering the proliferation of ‘audit’ only device. Data communication costs, the costs of getting the data back to a central computer center can be a significant limitation on getting vending equipment remotely ‘audit’ capable or as it is commonly referred to in the vending industry as ‘online’.</p>
  <p num="p-0018">Such telecommunication costs can include the cost of running a telephone line to the vending equipment. In many cases the vending equipment may be in a location not conducive to having a dedicated phone line installed proximate to the vending equipment, such as in a concrete basement, on a golf course, in a shopping mall, or on a university campus to name a few. Once a telephone line is installed there can be monthly service charges incurred from the telecommunication company providing the service. These costs alone can in effect nullify the savings of having the vending equipment ‘online’.</p>
  <p num="p-0019">To avoid the high expense of running dedicated telephone lines to vending equipment the vending industry has pursued wireless wide area network (WAN) options. Implementing a wireless WAN has typically involved purchasing additional wireless hardware, and trying to integrate the wireless hardware with the ‘audit’ hardware. If the integration effort was successfully the hardware, service, and maintenance costs of the combined solution were typically significantly increased compared to the ‘audit’ device only solution costs. In addition, the service and maintenance required for the combined wireless system is typically different then the non-wireless ‘audit’ device only solution.</p>
  <p num="p-0020">In addition to the increased hardware costs for the wireless WAN solution, the wireless communication service fees paid to the wireless network provider can be more then those fees charged by the communication companies providing telephone line service. A technology solution and service fee structure that could effectively nullify the anticipated sales and delivery savings from having the vending equipment ‘online’.</p>
  <p num="p-0021">In part a long felt need exists for a solution related to a cost effective system and method for remotely auditing vending equipment, and for providing additional payment options at the point of sale for goods and services vended from vending equipment. This coupled with the industry's shortcoming in these areas and other areas, some of which were mentioned above give rise to the present invention.</p>

The MDB message parsing and response routine decodes the message sent from the VMC and takes the appropriate action and sends the appropriate response to the VMC.</p>
  <p num="p-0178">One advantage of this dual mode of operation is that the mimic MDB interface <b>516</b> can support proprietary or different versions of MDB protocol and appear to a peripheral device as a VMC. In this regard peripheral devices that are not compatible with the vending equipment's VMC control system can be interconnected with system <b>500</b>'s mimic MDB bus <b>516</b>. Through software resident on the system <b>500</b> the peripheral device by way of the mimic MDB interface <b>516</b> can data communicate with the system <b>500</b> and or through the system <b>500</b>'s (with protocol interpolation) MDB interface <b>518</b>, over the vending equipment's MDB bus to the vending equipment's VMC control system.</p>
  <p num="p-0179">A second advantage of the dual mode of operation of the mimic MDB interface <b>516</b> is that features supported by a peripheral resultant from the implementation of a derivative MDB specification can be utilized by data communication first to the system <b>500</b> by way of the mimic MDB interface <b>516</b>. If the MDB protocol command is a command supported by the vending equipment's VMC controller the system <b>500</b> can then relay the message received from the peripheral device to the VMC control system by way of the system <b>500</b>'s MDB interface <b>518</b>. In this regard the system <b>500</b> essentially acts as a MDB interface gateway sending and receiving non-VMC support portions of a peripheral's implement MDB specification. In addition, the MDB gateway implemented by the system <b>500</b> can allow the peripheral device data communication access to the VMC controller for portions of the peripheral implemented MDB specification supported by the vending equipment's VMC controller.</p>

@&lt;esc&gt;V—REQUEST FOR MDB TRANSACTION STRING DATA. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref> there is shown a MDB TRANSACTION STRING with system <b>500</b> and vending equipment interface.
</p>
  <p num="p-0213">In an exemplary embodiment the MDB TRANSACTION STRING is constructed and managed in memory accessible by microcontroller <b>502</b>. The MDB TRANSACTION STRING includes at least one of the following data fields a VEND STATE field, a MAX VEND SALE field, a SALE PRICE field, a COLUMN field, or a VEND FLAG field.</p>
  <p num="p-0214">The VEND STATE field is a one-character field that indicates the current state of the vending equipment. Valid VEND STATE can include ‘I’ for inactive state, ‘D’ for disable state, ‘E’ for enable state, ‘R’ for vend request state, ‘S’ for in session state, or ‘V’ for vend state, as well as other vend states.</p>
  <p num="p-0215">The MAX VEND SALE is the value of the highest priced item in the vending machine as reported by the vending machine to the system <b>500</b> during the MDB setup sequence. The MAX VEND SALE value is typically part of the MDB 11 00 (as defined in the NAMA MDB specification) setup command but can be data communicated to the system <b>500</b> in other ways.</p>
  <p num="p-0216">The SALE PRICE is the vend sale price of the vend item selected from the vending machine as reported by the vending machine during an MDB VEND REQUEST message transaction with system <b>500</b>. Typically the SALE PRICE is part of the MDB VEND REQUEST command 13 00 (as defined in the NAMA MDB specification) but can be data communicated to the system <b>500</b> in other ways. The VEND REQUEST command is typically sent from the VMC to the system <b>500</b> when a user selects an item from the vending machine. In general, the vending machine reports the SALE PRICE and the COLUMN information while in a vend session and does not dispense products or services until the vend approved message sent by the system <b>500</b> is received by the vending machine (received by the vending machine's VMC).</p>
  <p num="p-0217">The COLUMN field is the column identification (the column the vended item is residing in within the vending machine typically used to track inventory) of the vend item selected from said vending machine as reported by the vending machine during an MDB VEND REQUEST message transaction with the system <b>500</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0218">The VEND FLAG field is a one-character field that indicates the status of a vend cycle. The VEND FLAG field can include: ‘C’ for clear flag, ‘$’ for currency vend flag, ‘P’ for vend pending flag, ‘A’ for vend approved flag, ‘D’ for vend declined flag, ‘V’ for cashless vend occurrence flag, ‘F’ for vend fail flag, as well as other vend flags.</p>
  <p num="p-0219">In an exemplary embodiment, during execution of firmware by microcontroller <b>502</b> a mutually exclusive routine <b>512</b>C (mutually exclusive routine operating independently of other routines, procedures, applications, <b>512</b>B application code, or systems) can be utilized to manage and report on the state and operation of the VMC. In this regard, a wide variety of application code (running on microcontroller <b>502</b> or other system and or microcontrollers) and computing platforms <b>802</b> can manage and monitor the vending machine state of operation characteristics with respect to the vend process.</p>
  <p num="p-0220">In operation a data communication connection between a vending machine <b>402</b> and system <b>500</b> includes a connection between the vending machine <b>402</b> and at least one of the vending equipment interfaces (<b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, and <b>536</b> are shown). Data communication in the way of MDB initialization, setup, polling, session, as well as other types of data communication occurs between the vending machine <b>402</b> and the system <b>500</b>. Microcontroller <b>502</b> having data communication access to memory <b>512</b>A constructs and manages the MDB transaction string in memory. As data is exchanged between the vending machine <b>402</b> and the system <b>500</b>, microcontroller <b>502</b> updates the MDB transaction string as required.</p>
  <p num="p-0221">Utilization of the MDB TRANSACTION STRING occurs when application code running in memory <b>512</b>B, and or computing platform <b>802</b> interconnected with system <b>500</b> by way of the interactive interface <b>532</b> read the MDB TRANSACTION STRING to make certain determinations. For example and not limitation an application running in memory <b>512</b>B can read the MDB string VEND STATE FLAG field and determine the current state is MDB VEND STATE ‘D’ for disable. This can cause the application code to display a message by way of display interface <b>508</b> that the vending machine is DISABLED and can not transact a vend. Upon the vending machine <b>402</b> data communicating with the system <b>500</b> by way of the various vending equipment interfaces the vending machine <b>402</b> may communicated the MDB reader enable 14 01 (as defined in the NAMA MDB specification) command. The microcontroller <b>502</b> would then update the MDB TRANSACTION STRING with the ‘E’ for enable. The application code running in memory <b>512</b>B upon reading the VEND STATE FIELD would now determine the vending machine is MDB VEND STATE ‘E’ for enabled and could display a message by way of display interface <b>508</b> that the vending machine is ENABLED and ready for vending.</p>
  <p num="p-0222">In another exemplary embodiment a computing platform <b>802</b> can monitor the MDB TRANSACTION STRING to determine the current state and condition of the vending machine <b>402</b>. In addition, the computing platform <b>802</b> can data communicate by way of the interactive interface <b>532</b> commands to be executed by microcontroller <b>502</b>. Such commands are referred to as the ‘@’, ‘#’, AAA, and BBB commands disclosed herein.</p>
  <p num="p-0223">As an example and not limitation, computing platform <b>802</b> can monitor and control vending machine <b>402</b> by way of interactive interface <b>532</b> by utilizing the @&lt;esc&gt;I, @&lt;esc&gt;V, @&lt;esc&gt;T, and or the @&lt;esc&gt;H commands to monitor the presence of card data and the current MDB TRANSACTION STRING setting. One advantage of invoking the @&lt;esc&gt;I interrupt command is the once invoked any time the MDB TRANSACTION STRING or card reader buffer change the MDB TRANSACTION STRING and or card reader buffer will be data communicated from the system <b>500</b> to the computing platform <b>802</b>. In this configuration the computing platform <b>802</b> does not need to poll to determine whether card data or MDB TRANSACTION STRING status has changed—the data will be sent to the computing platform <b>802</b> when it does.</p>
  <p num="p-0224">The computing platform <b>802</b> can determine from the MDB TRANSACTION STRING that the vending machine is MDB VEND STATE ‘E’ enabled and ready for a vend cycle. The computing platform can then data communicate to the system <b>500</b> one of the @&lt;esc&gt;S, @&lt;esc&gt;B, or one of the @&lt;esc&gt;A (session commands) commands. These command instruct the system <b>500</b> to take certain actions that can include having the system <b>500</b> by way of the vending equipment interfaces data communicated to vending machine <b>402</b> the MDB BEGIN SESSION 03 04 (as defined in the NAMA MDB specification) command. The vending machine will respond by starting a session. The microcontroller <b>502</b> will update the MDB TRANSACTION STRING to reflect that the vending machine <b>402</b> is in session, MDB VEND STATE FLAG set to ‘S’.</p>
  <p num="p-0225">When a user pressing a button on the vending machine <b>402</b>, the vending machine <b>402</b> data communicates an MDB VEND REQUEST 13 00 (as defined in the NAMA MDB specification) with SALE PRICE and COLUMN detail information attached. System <b>500</b> upon receipt updates the MDB TRANSACTION STRING to reflect the SALE PRICE, COLUMN, and VEND FLAG ‘R’ vend request. The computing platform can either read the MDB TRANSACTION STRING (non interrupt mode) or the MDB TRANSACTION STRING will be data communicated upon change to the computing platform <b>802</b> (interrupt mode). If in the VEND ASSIST ON mode the computing platform <b>802</b> will have to send the #&lt;esc&gt;Q command to deny the vend request or the #&lt;esc&gt;R with sales detail to approve the vend request. The system <b>500</b> will respond to the computing platform <b>802</b> #&lt;esc&gt;Q and #&lt;esc&gt;R command by updating the MDB TRANSACTION string accordingly and sending the VEND DENIED 06 (as defined in the NAMA MDB specification) command to the vending machine <b>402</b>, or the VEND APPROVED 05 (as defined in the NAMA MDB specification) to the vending machine <b>402</b> respectively.</p>
  <p num="p-0226">In the VEND ASSIST OFF mode the VEND APPROVED 05 (as defined in the NAMA MDB specification) may be automatically generated and sent to the vending machine <b>402</b> by the system <b>500</b> in response to the VEND REQUEST message from the vending machine <b>402</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0227">In the event of the VEND APPROVED being sent to the vending machine <b>402</b> in response to a VEND REQUEST the MDB TRANSACTION STRING will be updated to MDB VEND FLAG ‘P’ for vend pending while the vending machine is dispensing the goods and or services and then either an MDB VEND FLAG ‘V’ for vended or ‘F’ for vend failed, upon vend success completion or vend attempt failed respectively. The computing platform <b>802</b> can read the MDB TRANSACTION STRING and take the appropriate actions including sending the @&lt;esc&gt;C command to clear the MDB TRANSACTION STRING to prepare for the next vend cycle.</p>
  <p num="p-0228">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> there is shown a MDB TRANSACTION STRING updating routine <b>2100</b>. Processing begins in block <b>2102</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0229">In block <b>2102</b> the MDB TRANSACTION string is updated in system <b>500</b> memory.

Field #1 is the MAX VEND PRICE as reported by the vending machine controller (VMC) during the MDB initialization process. The MAX VEND PRICE is the value of the highest priced item in the vending machine as reported by the vending equipment during an MDB initialization process. This can be a 6 byte field.
<br>
Field #2 is the SALE PRICE. The SALE PRICE is determined in the MDB protocol for the VEND—Request Command (See. Multi Drop Bus (MDB)/Internal Protocol Version 1.0 and 2.0 specification). The SALE PRICE is the vend sale price of the vend item as reported by the vending equipment during an MDB vend request transaction.
<br>
Field #3 is the COLUMN information. The COLUMN information is determined in the MDB protocol for the VEND—Request Command (See. Multi Drop Bus (MDB)/Internal Protocol Version 1.0 and 2.0 specification). The column identification of the vend item as reported by the vending equipment during an MDB vend request transaction.

NOTE: (If you are not using an MDB interface this may not apply) The MDB microcontroller/G4 MDB interface will continuously manage the changes to the MDB transaction string. For example as the MDB state changes the MDB state field will automatically be updated. There are however two scenarios that require the execution of the @&lt;esc&gt;C—CLEAR MDB TRANSACTION STRING DATA command. These two scenarios include when a currency vend has occurred and the ‘F’ field has been set to ‘$’, when a cashless vend has occurred and the ‘F’ field has been set to ‘V’. In both these cases the @&lt;esc&gt;C command will have to executed to clear the MDB TRANSACTION STRING before a new cash transaction can be tracked or a new cashless vending session can be started.

    </ul> <p num="p-0243">If the G4 is used in the VEND ACTIVE ‘ON’ mode the above does not apply in that the G4 will clear the MDB TRANSACTION string as appropriate. If the G4 is used in the G4 VEND ACTIVE ‘OFF’ mode the above will apply.</p>
  <p num="h-0017">@&lt;esc&gt;C—CLEAR MDB TRANSACTION STRING DATA. The MDB controller/G4 will clear the SALE PRICE field, COLUMN information field, and the transaction condition flag is set to ‘C’. The result string will return:
<br>STX+[OK-C]+ETX+LRC<br>
@&lt;esc&gt;H—HYBRID COMMAND FOR SEND CARD DATA AND MDB STRING. The MDB controller/G4 will send both the card reader data (see @&lt;esc&gt;T above) followed by the MDB string (see @&lt;esc&gt;V). The result string will return:
<br>STX+[@&lt;esc&gt;T response]+ETX+LRC+STX+[@&lt;esc&gt;V RESPONSE]+ETX+LRC<br>
@&lt;esc&gt;S—BEGIN A SESSION COMMAND. The MDB controller/G4 will begin an MDB session (see NAMA MDB specification V1.0, V2.0 for BEGIN SESSION command). The result string will return:
<br>STX+[OK-S]+ETX+LRC<br>
The G4 must have the MDB state set to ‘E’ for ENABLED in order to start a session. If a session cannot be started the result string will return:
<br>STX+[UNABLE-S]+ETX+LRC<br>
@&lt;esc&gt;X—END A SESSION COMMAND. The MDB controller/G4 will END an MDB session (see NAMA MDB specification V1.0, V2.0 for SESSION CANCEL command). The result string will return:

While in the interrupt mode the MDB controller/G4 will send the result string for the @&lt;esc&gt;T and the @&lt;esc&gt;V commands shown above each time the respective data fields change.
<br>
For example, while in the interrupt mode the MDB controller/G4 will send the @&lt;esc&gt;T result string on the successful read of a magnetic card.
<br>
In addition, while in the interrupt mode the MDB controller/G4 will send the @&lt;esc&gt;V result string each time any field in the MDB TRANSACTION STRING changes.
<br>
Default: The default condition on microcontroller reset is ‘OFF’.
<br>
@&lt;esc&gt;1—TOGGLE MDB CODE CAPTURE MODE. The MDB controller/G4 will return the result string below toggling between ‘ON’ and ‘OFF’ of the MDB CODE CAPTURE mode. This command is for diagnostic purposes only and should not be used during normal G4 operation. The intended purpose for this command is to diagnosis MDB related transaction issues during development and or testing.
<br>
STX+[ON-I]+ETX+LRC →When toggling into the MDB code capture mode.
<br>
STX+[OFF-I]+ETX+LRC →When toggling out of the MDB code capture mode
<br>
When the MDB code capture mode is switched to the ‘ON’ mode the following sequence of events begins:
</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p num="p-0244">The RAM/NOVRAM memory dedicated to the storage of vending transaction is cleared. All data (transactions) currently being stored will be erased to make room for the MDB bus codes.</p>
  <p num="p-0245">The G4 will begin recording both the received MDB codes from the vending machine controller (VMC) and the sent MDB codes from the G4. There is RAM room for approximately 15 seconds of recording time.</p>
  <p num="p-0246">When the MDB code capture mode is switched to the ‘OFF’ mode the G4 will stop recording the MDB bus codes. A buffer dump of the MDB codes exchanged between the G4 and the VMC can be viewed by executing @&lt;esc&gt;2 the MDB CAPTURED CODE BUFFER DUMP command.</p>
  <p num="p-0247">NOTE: When you are ready to return the G4 system to the normal operation mode you should 1) insure that the MDB CODE CAPTURE mode is ‘OFF’ and 2) Execute the @&lt;esc&gt;J CLEAR MAIN MEMORY command to clear and reset the G4 main memory. The CLEAR MAIN MEMORY command is important in that the MDB codes captured are stored in the RAM/NOVRAM area and may interfere with the G4 normal record management procedures.</p>
  <p num="p-0248">In addition, when the MDB capture mode is switched to ‘ON’ the G4 will stay in this state until either 1) the buffer area for MDB codes is filled (about 15 seconds) or 2) the MDB capture mode is switched to ‘OFF’. Even if the G4 is powered ‘OFF’ or the @&lt;esc&gt;K HARDWARE RESET command is issued the MDB capture mode state will not change. The reason for this is to allow the MDB capture mode to be turned “ON” and remain ‘ON’ capturing MDB transaction codes between the vending machine and the G4 while the vending machine and or G4 go through a power up or reset procedure.</p>
  <p num="p-0249">If the G4 is in a vending transaction the TOGGLE MDB CODE CAPTURE MODE command cannot be executed to turn ‘ON’ the MDB capture feature. If the TOGGLE MDB CODE CAPTURE MODE command is executed during a vending session the MDB capture mode will be turned ‘OFF’ and the result string will return:
<br>STX+[OFF-1]+ETX+LRC<br>
Default: The default condition on microcontroller reset is ‘OFF’.
<br>
@&lt;esc&gt;2—MDB CAPTURE MODE BUFFER DUMP. The MDB controller/G4 will return the result string below dumping the MDB codes passed between the G4 and the vending machine controller (VMC). The output will be formatted to indicate which codes were transmitted by the VMC and which codes were transmitted by the G4. This command is for diagnostic purposes only and should not be used during normal G4 operation. The intended purpose for this command is to diagnosis MDB related transaction issues during development and or testing.

@&lt;esc&gt;Y—TOGGLE G4 VEND ACTIVE MODE ON/OFF. The G4 can operate in two modes of operation. In the VEND ACTIVE ‘ON’ mode of operation the G4 provides all the MDB interface control, audit/cashless payment support, and network connectivity. In this mode a computing platform can interact with the G4 in a hybrid role to monitor a string of user text prompts (see DISPLAY PROTOCOL) as well as execute the NON-MDB-CONTROL and some MDB-CONTROL commands.
</p>
  <p num="p-0251">In the VEND ACTIVE ‘OFF’ mode of operation the G4 can be configured and serve as an MDB controller only. In this mode both the MDB-CONTROL and NON-MDB-CONTROL commands can be executed. While in this mode of operation the computing platform operates as a master device controlling the operation and process flow of the system, and the G4 serves as a slave device interfacing to the vending machine and managing the control of the MDB interface. The result sting will return:

<br>
Default: The default condition on microcontroller reset is ‘ON’
<br>
#&lt;esc&gt;R—TOGGLE G4 VEND ASSIST MODE ON/OFF. The G4 can operate in two vending modes of operation (while the VEND ACTIVE mode is ‘OFF’). In the VEND ASSIST ‘ON’ mode of operation the G4 will set the ‘R’ VEND REQUEST state flag in the MDB TRANSACTION STRING when the G4 receives the VEND REQUEST MDB command from the vending machine's VMC. It is then the responsibility of the attached computing platform to issue either the @&lt;esc&gt;A+SALE-[xxxxx] command to approve the vend and provide the sale amount, or the #&lt;esc&gt;Q command to DECLINE the vend, referred to as VEND DENY the vend. The MDB TRANSACTION STRING should be monitored to determine when the ‘R’ REQUEST VEND APPROVE state is set. After the determination that the VEND REQUEST state is set the VEND APPROVED or VEND DECLINED command should be executed.
</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p num="p-0252">In the VEND ASSIST ‘OFF’ mode of operation the G4 will automatically provide the VEND APPROVED response to the vending machine's VMC when the VEND REQUEST command is received from the VMC. The result sting will return:

@&lt;esc&gt;$—SIMULATE CASH VEND TRANSACTION. The G4 will simulate a CASH VEND transaction (see MDB spec V1.0 for CASH VEND command). The result sting will return:
<br>STX+[OK-$]+ETX+LRC<br>
To simulate the CASH VEND the MDB TRANSACTION STRING will be set to the following:

<br>STX+[UNABLE-$]+ETX+LRC<br>
@&lt;esc&gt;#—SIMULATE CASHLESS VEND TRANSACTION. The G4 will simulate a CURRENCY VEND transaction (see NAMA MDB spec V1.0 and V2.0 for VEND REQUEST and VEND APPROVED commands). The result sting will return:
<br>STX+[OK-#]+ETX+LRC<br>
To simulate the CASHLESS VEND the MDB TRANSACTION STRING will be set to the following:
<br>STX+[E0005000001250001V]+ETX+LRC</p>
  <p num="p-0254">If the G4 is in not in a vending transaction a SIMULATE CASHLESS VEND transaction cannot be executed. If a SIMULATE CASHLESS VEND transaction cannot be executed the result string will return:
<br>STX+[UNABLE-#]+ETX+LRC<br>
@&lt;esc&gt;M—TOGGLE MODEM COMMUNICATION ACCESS. The G4 will switch the serial communication ports being utilized by the computing platform to the MDB controller/G4 communication port. In this regard the computing platform can utilize the communication port (modem and or wireless) of the MDB controller/G4. The result sting will return:
</p> <ul> <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0267">STX+[ON-M]+ETX+LRC →When toggling into the communication mode—allowing the computing platform to use the MDB controller/G4 communication port.

<br>
NOTE: The communication parameters between the G4 are outlined above as 9600, no parity, 8 data bits, and 2 stop bits. Upon executing the @&lt;esc&gt;M command ‘ON’ the G4 switches direct access to the communication device. If for example, a 2400 baud modem is being used the device issuing the @&lt;esc&gt;M command will have to first change its baud rate to 2400 before the G4 modem can respond to the requests. Furthermore, upon the conclusion of a communication session before the @&lt;esc&gt;M command can be issued and interpreted by the G4, to switch the communications ‘OFF’, the baud rate of the device issuing the @&lt;esc&gt;M command should change its baud rate back to 9600 N, 8, 2.
<br>
Default: The default condition on microcontroller reset is ‘OFF’
<br>
@&lt;esc&gt;Q—SEND CURRENT TRANSACTION RECORD. The G4 will return the current transaction record. The current transaction record is a fixed length record. The parsed fields are listed below. The result sting will return:
<br>STX+[RECORD NUMBER-TRANSACTION RECORD]+ETX+LRC</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p num="p-0255">If the G4 is not in a vending transaction a SEND CURRENT TRANSACTION RECORD transaction cannot be executed. If a SEND CURRENT TRANSACTION RECORD transaction cannot be executed the result string will return:

@&lt;esc&gt;A+STX+SALE-+[5 BYTES OF DATA]+ETX+LRC—The VEND APPROVED command has two modes of operation. If the vender interface is set to MDB INTERFACE only the ‘R’ REQUEST VEND APPROVAL mode is supported. That is the G4 is connected to vending equipment by way of the MDB INTERFACE connector and the firmware select is the MDB INTERFACE and the VEND ASSIST MODE=‘ON’.
</p>
  <p num="p-0279">If the vending interface is set to the BILL PULSE INTERFACE or the BILL SERIAL INTERFACE the ‘R’ REQUEST VEND APPROVE MODE and the ‘U’ USER SELECTED AMOUNT MODES are supported. That is the G4 is not connected to vending equipment by way of the MDB INTERFACE connector and the firmware select is set to either the BILL SERIAL INTERFACE or the BILL PULSE INTERFACE then the VEND APPROVED command operates as described above when the VEND ASSIST MODE=‘ON’.</p>
  <p num="p-0280">‘R’—REQUEST VEND APPROVE MODE—The VEND APPROVE response should be sent in response to the MDB TRANSACTION STRING indicating the ‘R’ REQUEST VEND APPROVE flag state. The ‘R’ REQUEST VEND APPROVE flag state is set when the VMC sends the G4 the VEND REQUEST MDB command and the VEND ASSIST MODE=‘ON’. The 5 data bytes should be in the form ‘00000’ and should be the desired amount for the G4 to charge for the vended item. The VMC will report by way of the MDB TRANSACTION STRING the price and column of the vended item requested, in accordance with the MDB transactions formatting. The price reported would be the value of the item as set in the vending machine. If a charge equal to the vending machines reported price is desired, for example ‘00125’ for $1.25, then the correct VEND APPROVED response should be as follows:
<br>@&lt;esc&gt;A+STX+SALE-00125+ETX+LRC</p>
  <p num="p-0281">If a different price is to be charged for the item the VEND APPROVED response can be altered. For example:
<br>@&lt;esc&gt;A+STX+SALE-00000+ETX+LRC—For a free vend $0.00<br>@&lt;esc&gt;A+STX+SALE-00300+ETX+LRC—For a $3.00<br>@&lt;esc&gt;A+STX+SALE-09999+ETX+LRC—For a $99.99<br>
NOTE: In lieu of having to send the @&lt;esc&gt;A+STX+SALE command as a VEND APPROVE response, a NON-RESPONSE format can also be implemented. In a NON-RESPONSE format not responding to a system <b>500</b> REQUEST VEND APPROVE within a preset time period can be interpreted as VEND APPROVE with a sale amount of the MDB TRANSACTION STRING—SALE PRICE amount. In this regard, the MDB TRANSACTION STRING—SALE PRICE amount is typically the sale price reported by the vending equipment when a user makes a selection and a MDB VEND REQUEST is generated.
<br>
‘U’—USER SELECTED AMOUNT—To start a vending session in the BILL SERIAL INTERFACE or BILL PULSE INTERFACE configurations the VEND APPROVED command can be used to select a USER amount (The amount to charge the user). Successive VEND APPROVED commands can be issued to change the USER SELECTED AMOUNT. In this regard, the MDB transaction string will reflect the VEND SALE AMOUNT and the MDB flag state will be set to ‘U’. This indicates that a transaction amount has been selected. Provided the INHIBIT pin is enabled (LOW STATE) the G4 will now accept a card for payment. If or when the card is approved the ‘U’ MDB flag state will change to ‘R’ REQUEST VEND APPROVE if the VEND ASSIST MODE=‘ON’. If the VEND ASSIST MODE=“OFF” then upon transaction approval the vend will be completed.
</p>
  <p num="p-0282">If the G4 terminal is connected to a BILL SERIAL INTERFACE or BILL PULSE INTERFACE upon card approval and or REQUEST VEND APPROVE the users selected amount will be transferred via the bill interface and the sale amount of the transaction adjusted accordingly. If the G4 is configured such that no connection is made to the BILL interface connector then consideration should be given to either providing a control signal to the INHIBIT line to enable and disable the terminal accordingly or jumping GND to INHIBIT to enable the G4 terminal.</p>
  <p num="h-0022">The range of the sale amount can be from $0.00 formatted as ‘00000’ to $99.99 formatted as ‘09999’.</p>
  <p num="p-0283">The G4 will issue the VEND APPROVED MDB command to the VMC and the MDB TRANSACTION STRING will be updated as appropriately. The G4 will return the result string:
<br>STX+[OK-A]+ETX+LRC<br>
@&lt;esc&gt;A+STX+VIEW-+[‘M’ 1 BYTE MEMORY CODE]+[‘xxxxxxxx’ 8 BYTES MEMORY LOCATION]+ETX+LRC—The MEMORY VIEW command provides a means for requesting and obtaining current memory values from the G4 terminal. The 1 byte MEMORY CODE selects the memory device to return the value from. Valid MEMORY CODES are shown in the table below. The eight byte hexadecimal value that represents the MEMORY LOCATION is the physical address in memory to be viewed. The MEMORY VALUE returned in the result code in the value currently store in the MEMORY LOCATION.

@&lt;esc&gt;A+STX+SAVE-+[‘M’ 1 BYTE MEMORY CODE]+[‘xxxxxxxx’ 8 BYTES MEMORY LOCATION]+[‘x’ 1 BYTE OF DATA]+ETX+LRC—The MEMORY SAVE command provides a means for writing data into the G4 memory. The 1 byte MEMORY CODE selects the memory device to write the DATA. Valid MEMORY CODES are shown in the table above. The eight byte hexadecimal value that represents the MEMORY LOCATION is the physical address in memory to be written. The MEMORY VALUE returned in the result code is the value currently stored in the MEMORY LOCATION—if the write was successful the value returned should be the same as the intended byte to DATA to be written.
<br>
For Example:
<br>@&lt;esc&gt;A+STX+SAVE-A000000C1FF+ETX+LRC<br>
will write the hex value $FF to the EEROM upper byte address location $C1.
<br>
The G4 will return the result string and 1 byte memory value as follows:
<br>STX+[OK-A-]+[‘x’ 1 BYTE MEMORY VALUE]+ETX+LRC<br>

<br>
@&lt;esc&gt;A+STX+DISP-+[1 BYTE LCD LINE (‘1’ or ‘2’)]+[UP TO ‘xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx’ 16 BYTES OF DATA]+ETX+LRC—The display command allows data to be written to the G4 auxiliary display board, such as card reader interface processor board <b>312</b>. Electrically a card reader assembly having a card reader, display board and optional printer can be plugged into the G4-eport auxiliary printer port, such a board can be card reader interface processor board <b>312</b>. In this regard when the display command is executed data is sent out the printer port to the attached card reader assembly. In addition to providing 2 lines of 16 character alphanumeric text a series of card reader assembly control codes are available. The card reader assembly (card reader interface processor board <b>312</b>) control codes (shown below) enable control of the LED on the face of the card reader and transaction button, beep the beeper, clear the screen, and control print functionality.

  <p num="p-0289">To issue a control command to the card reader assembly the appropriate code must be sent successive at least three character in a row. For example to beep the beeper the following display command can be issued:
<br>@&lt;esc&gt;A+STX+DISP-1+$0E+$0E+$0E+ETX+LRC<br>
To display ‘Sample Message 1’ text of line 1 of the LCD display the following display command can be issued:
<br>@&lt;esc&gt;A+STX+DISP-1+Sample Message 1+ETX+LRC<br>
To display ‘Message Line 2’ text of line 2 of the LCD display the following display command can be issued:

In each case the result string will return:
<br>STX+[OK-A]+ETX+LRC<br>
NOTE: When the card reader assembly is first powered up the current version of software running on the display card will appear on the LCD display. The LCD will not display any text until a display line of text is written to line 1. More specifically the display board is initialized upon receipt of the $80 character that is part of the line 1 formatting. Until the $80 character is received the card reader display codes will operate but no text writes to LCD line 2 will be displayed. Consideration should be given to writing a line of text (or blank spaces) to LCD line 1 with the DISP-1 display command to initialize the display board after power-up.

AAA—END SESSION AND PRINT RECEIPT. A session started when the G4 is in the VEND ACTIVE ‘ON’ mode is terminated and a receipt optionally printed by send a string of ‘AAA . . . ’. The correct use of this command should be to send a string of at least six ‘A’ characters. Though the G4 is only looking for a combination of three consecutive ‘A’s sending more is preferred.
<br>
BBB—BUTTON 2 PRESS. While in the service mode sending a string of ‘BBB . . . ’ has the same effect as inserting a card in the card reader to advance a menu selection or setting. The correct use of this command should be to send a string of at least three ‘B’ characters.

  <heading>G4 Text Display Prompts</heading> <p num="h-0032">Text Display Overview:</p>
  <p num="p-0304">When the G4 is in the VERBOSE ‘ON’ mode the G4 will send text messages out of the serial port to a display device. The display device can be the computing platform. The text messages correspond to the activity of the G4. For example, when the G4 is ready to accept cards a text prompt message of ‘Please Swipe’, ‘A Valid Card’ may be displayed.</p>
  <p num="p-0305">To simplify the interface and functionality requirements of the computing platform the text prompts from the G4 can be captured and displayed on the computing platform display. Doing so alleviates the need for the computing platform to ascertain and or determine what message should be displayed to the user. In addition, allowing the G4 to manage the vending transaction, MDB interface, and text prompts removes the need for the computing platform to get involved in the vending transaction.</p>
  <p num="p-0306">The text format display protocol below illustrates how the G4 sends text prompts. The selection of the control characters is consistent with the operating functionality of many text LCD displays.</p>

Cursor Display Codes
</p>
  <p num="p-0316">The G4 uses a series of display codes to locate the position of the cursor. There are a maximum of 32 cursor positions—two rows of 16 characters. In addition there are cursor display codes to turn ‘ON’ a flashing cursor, turn ‘ON’ an underline cursor (show cursor), and to turn ‘OFF’ the cursor (hide cursor). The codes are similar to those used for typical text LCD displays.</p>
  <p num="p-0317">To locate the cursor in the display area the table below illustrates the hex code and corresponding cursor location.</p>

  <p num="p-0341">There can be at least two methods of interconnecting a system <b>500</b>'s interactive interface <b>532</b> to a computing platform <b>802</b>.

  <p num="p-0347">A limitation on peripheral devices can be that they must support a compatible version of the MDB protocol specification to operate correctly.

  <p num="p-0369">A second advantage of implementing a system <b>500</b> in software can be that the proprietary nature of the software and its functional capabilities can more easily be concealed and protected when resident and secured within a microcontroller. In addition to the secure ability of the system <b>500</b> solutions, implementing a system <b>500</b> in a microcontroller brand or series that other design engineers are familiar with can be advantageous in easing the integration of the system <b>500</b> semiconductor package <b>1002</b> into electrical designs.</p>

  <p num="p-0371">One advantage of allowing power convert <b>1020</b> to supply power to semiconductor <b>1002</b> can be that the semiconductor can be resident on an adapter card and retrofit to existing VMC's by connection to the VMC's vending equipment interface <b>902</b>. Through this single connection point the adapter card comprising the semiconductor <b>1002</b> can power itself and data communicate with the VMC by way of the VMC vending equipment interface <b>902</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0372">Furthermore, the semiconductor <b>1002</b> can be integrated into the VMC controller electronics and electrically connected on the circuit board to the VMC vending equipment interface <b>902</b>. Simplifying the data and power connections between semiconductor <b>1002</b> and the VMC can save time and effort in the integration of the combined VMC/system <b>500</b> solution. In addition, the fact that the system <b>500</b> can operate mutually exclusive from the VMC can be advantageous in the design of the overall combined VMC/system <b>500</b> solution.</p>

  <p num="p-0374">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> there is shown an MDB initialization tuning routine <b>1100</b>. With the proliferation of different kinds and styles for vending equipment VMC controllers the NAMA MDB and NAMA derivative MDB protocol implementation can vary from VMC to VMC. In addition the processing capabilities, UART implementations and lack of UART implementations can cause a variation in VMC microcontroller performances. These performance variations in VMC microcontrollers can cause the serial communications between VMC to vary in the devices ability and speed by which data bytes can be consecutively data communicated to the VMC controller. In addition to data communication speed and response timing another variation between VMC's can be interpretation of protocol command functionality, usage, and messaging formatting.</p>
  <p num="p-0375">Another source of VMC MDB protocol implementation variations can occur as a result of the VMC computing power and or microprocessor speed or (millions of instructions per second) MIPS capability. Microprocessor speed can influence MDB protocol implementation and message transaction speed in several ways. One such way can be in the MDB interface to the microprocessor.</p>
  <p num="p-0376">MDB message transactions are a string of serial bytes. As such bytes must arrive one at a time to the VMC microprocessor. Once a byte arrives it must be fetched from the VMC microprocessor receive buffer and processed. The time required to fetch a byte can vary from VMC to VMC. As such the MDB INTER-BYTE TIME SPACING, which is the amount of time delay inserted between sent bytes could be a critical variable. If for example and not limitation a string of bytes arrive to close together, or in other words the MDB INTER-BYTE TIME SPACING is too short the VMC may not be able to process the bytes and as a result the system <b>500</b> could fail to initialize and operate correctly. If for example and not limitation a string of bytes arrive to far apart, or in other words the MDB INTER-BYTE TIME SPACING is too long the VMC may time-out and fail to process the MDB message. As a result the system <b>500</b> could fail to initialize and operate correctly.</p>
  <p num="p-0377">The MDB protocol involves a master-slave relationship between the master vending equipment's VMC and the slave peripheral devices. In implementing the MDB protocol the master VMC initiates an MDB message command to a slave peripheral device. The slave peripheral device then has a finite amount of time to respond to the VMC command message with a message response. As such the amount of time allotted for the peripheral device to respond with a MDB message response can vary from VMC to VMC. If for example and not limitation the peripheral device responds too quickly with a message response the VMC's microprocessor may not be ready and miss the return message. As a result the system <b>500</b> could fail to initialize and operate correctly. If for example and not limitation the peripheral device takes too much time to respond to the message the VMC may time-out waiting for the peripherals response message. As a result the system <b>500</b> could fail to initialize and operate correctly. An MDB MESSAGE RESPONSE timer is utilized to implement a pause from the time a MDB message is received from the VMC to the time an MDB message response from the system <b>500</b> is sent to the VMC.</p>
  <p num="p-0378">The MDB initialization tuning routine <b>1100</b> determines through successive iterations of the MDB initialization sequence the optimum MDB INTER-BYTE TIME SPACING and MDB MESSAGE RESPONSE timing. Processing begins in block <b>1102</b>. In block <b>1102</b> the MDB INTER-BYTE INTERVAL SPACING and the MDB MESSAGE RESPONSE timers are set to a minimum range setting. Processing then moves to block <b>1104</b>. Appropriate MDB MESSAGE RESPONSE time can range from a minimum range of a few microseconds to a maximum range of a several milliseconds. Appropriate MDB MESSAGE RESPONSE time can range from a minimum range of less than one millisecond to a maximum range of five to ten milliseconds. Preferable a range can be from 0.5 milliseconds to 7 milliseconds and changeable by a user and or under software control.</p>
  <p num="p-0379">In block <b>1104</b> the system <b>500</b> waits for the VMC to initiate the POLL command. In response to the POLL command the system <b>500</b> sends the JUST RESET command. Processing then moves to block <b>1106</b>.</p>

  <p num="p-0412">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> there is shown a transceiver and modem base unit system <b>700</b> wireless protocol data communication routine <b>2000</b>. In an exemplary embodiment the base unit <b>700</b> serves as a data gateway between the system <b>500</b> and a remote location. In operation the system <b>500</b> 1) initially requests data access to the base unit <b>700</b>, and if data access is granted by the base unit <b>700</b> then 2) begins utilizing the base unit <b>700</b> internal modem by transmitting and receiving data packets to and from the base unit <b>700</b>. The base unit <b>700</b> manages 1) granting or denying data communication access between the system <b>500</b> terminal and the base unit <b>700</b>, 2) the receiving of packetized wireless data from the system <b>500</b> for processing and data communication to the internal base unit <b>700</b> modem <b>704</b>, and 3) the receiving of data from the internal base unit <b>700</b> modem, processing, packetizing, and wireless data communication via transceiver <b>708</b> to the system <b>500</b> terminal.</p>
  <p num="p-0413">The data packets and wireless communication protocol can be encrypted, and error checked for data integrity. In addition, the remote hosts both credit bureau and the USALIVE network can perform their own data integrity checking. In essence the data packets can be error checked and the data received at the hosts can be error checked.</p>
  <p num="p-0414">In an exemplary embodiment the packet by packet error checking can be turned off at the base unit <b>700</b> and system <b>500</b> and the data packets can be automatically sent multiple time. In this regard, error checking of each packet still occurs and only correct error free packets are passed to the remote location. Packets with errors are just discarded. If an error in a packet is detected it is the successive sending of the same packet that is relied upon to overcome the error. With no ACKing or NAKing on a packet by packet basis a half duplex transceiver system can send more data faster by not having to switch between send and receive modes. Since the remote location has calculated its own checksums and appended it to the data the remote location can determine if all data was received and received correctly. If the determination is made at the remote location that the data was not received correctly then the remote location can data communicate a NAK and the system will retransmit the data.</p>
  <p num="p-0415">The wireless communication protocol comprises a successive try-retry algorithm to insure the wireless data transmission is received complete and error free. In the event wireless data can't be transmitted error free or packets are missing the system <b>500</b> has embedded programmable functionality to compensate for the dropped transmission.</p>

If the resultant is in the negative that is the MAXIMUM AUTHORIZATION ATTEMPTS LIMIT has been reached then the routine is exited the card is reported as declined.</p>
  <p num="p-0447">In block <b>1316</b> the transaction is reported as authorized and the vending equipment is enabled for operation. The routine is then exited.</p>
  <p num="p-0448">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A–19B</figref> there is shown a local authorization routine <b>1900</b>. Routine <b>1900</b> is an exemplary embodiment of a local authorization routine. Routine <b>1900</b> utilizes locally stored databases to selectively approve and decline a card transaction. Similar to routine <b>1300</b>, routine <b>1900</b> can be implemented to reduce or eliminate the authorization delay while maintaining a high confidence that the card is valid.</p>
  <p num="p-0449">Payment identification data can be referred to as a card, and can be any form of ID including a credit card, magnetic card, wireless phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a pager, private label card, smart card, hotel room card, radio frequency RFID identification, touch or contact ID, biometric, and or other similar or suitable form of ID. In general, payment identification data (referred to as card) is a unique ID used by a user for identification and or payment from goods and or services vended from vending equipment. Processing begins in decision block <b>1902</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0450">In decision block <b>1902</b> a test is performed to determine if the payment identification data (card) presented is expired. In an exemplary embodiment expiration information can be encoded in the payment identification data. If the resultant is in the affirmative that is the card is expired then processing moves to block <b>1914</b>. If the resultant is in the negative that is the card is not expired then processing moves to decision block <b>1904</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0451">In decision block <b>1904</b> a test is performed to determine if the modulo-10 of the card presented is correct. The modulo check can be a mathematical routine to determine the validity of payment identification data sequence. Such modulo checks typically utilize a mathematical routine that produces a specific check digit or character. The correct check digit can be encoded in the payment identification data and can be check against the calculate value to determine if the data sequence is valid.</p>
  <p num="p-0452">If the resultant in decision block <b>1904</b> is in the affirmative that is the modulo-10 check digit matches then processing move to decision block <b>1906</b>. If the result in decision block <b>1904</b> is in the negative that is the modulo-10 check digit does not match then processing moves to block <b>1914</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0453">In block <b>1914</b> the transaction authorization is declined and the routine is exited.</p>
  <p num="p-0454">In decision block <b>1906</b> a test is made to determine if the MAXIMUM APPROVAL RESET HOUR has been reached. If the resultant is in the affirmative that is the MAXIMUM RESET HOUR has been reached then processing moves to block <b>1910</b>. If the resultant is in the negative that is the MAXIMUM RESET HOUR has not been reached then processing moves to decision block <b>1908</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0455">In block <b>1910</b> the APPROVAL database is erased and the MAXIMUM RESET HOUR timer is reset. The MAXIMUM RESET HOUR is a remotely programmable preset condition that indicates the time interval in hours between erasing of the APPROVAL DATABASE.</p>
  <p num="p-0456">In an exemplary embodiment erasing the APPROVAL database at a periodic interval limits the amount of time a user can present the same payment identification data in a specific period of time without having the payment identification data declined or requiring the authorization of the payment identification data with a remote location. For example and not limitation if a certain payment identification data can be presented for payment only once every 24 hours the local authorization upon seeing the same payment identification data a second time within the same 24 hour period will either decline the payment identification data or attempt to remotely authorize the payment identification data. If however the user waits more than 24 hours before representing the same payment identification data the clearing of the APPROVAL database will occur and the users payment identification data can be accepted as if presented for the first time. Processing than moves to decision block <b>1908</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0457">In another exemplary embodiment, under normal system <b>500</b> terminal use payment identification data (card) can be added to the APPROVAL database each time a valid card is locally authorized. Over time the MAXIMUM OCCURRENCE WARNING LIMIT, and the MAXIMUM OCCURRENCE STOP LIMIT will be reached. Upon exceeding these limits, the system <b>500</b> terminal will attempt to authorize the card remotely. If it is the intention to allow a user to locally authorize a card, for example each day, without requiring an occasional remote authorization, but to limit the amount of local authorizations granted in a single day the MAXIMUM RESET HOUR can be set for example and not limitation to 24 hours. This will erase the APPROVAL database every 24 hours. As long as the repeat user does not exceed the MAXIMUM OCCURRENCE WARNING or STOP limits in a single 24-hour period no remote authorization will be required. The MAXIMUM RESET HOUR can be set to any amount of time including zero. In the case the MAXIMUM RESET HOUR is set to zero the APPROVAL database will not be cleared automatically based on time.</p>
  <p num="p-0458">In decision block <b>1908</b> a determination is made as to whether the LOCAL AUTHORIZATION FLAG is set for this pass. In an exemplary embodiment system <b>500</b> can be programmed to locally authorize a card based in part on an iterative process, which allows for the local authorization routine to be invoked, at a minimum, on the first pass and subsequently at any successive pass up to the last pass. The current pass through the routine is referred to as the CURRENT AUTHORIZATION ATTEMPT. The last pass is predetermined and is referred to as the MAXIMUM AUTHORIZATION ATTEMPTS LIMIT. The LOCAL AUTHORIZATION FLAG determines on which iterative pass the local authorization routine will be invoked. The iterative pass in which the LOCAL AUTHORIZATION FLAG will be set and the local authorization routine invoked is referred to as the LOCAL AUTHORIZATION ROUTINE ENTRY COUNTER.</p>
  <p num="p-0459">In a first example the local authorization can be invoked on the first pass. In this case no remote location will be contacted unless the local authorization results in a declined card response. In a second example the local authorization flag may be set for the second pass. In this case the system <b>500</b> will first try to remotely authorize the card. If the remote processing bureau is unavailable or unable to authorize the card then on the second pass the local authorization routine will be invoked.</p>
  <p num="p-0460">If the resultant in decision block <b>1908</b> is in the affirmative that is the LOCAL AUTHORIZATION flag is set then processing moves to decision block <b>1912</b>. If the resultant is in the negative that is the LOCAL AUTHORIZATION flag is not set then processing moves to block <b>1926</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0461">In decision block <b>1912</b> a test is performed to determine if the card presented for authorization is currently in the local DECLINED database. Is the resultant is in the affirmative that is the card is in the DECLINED database then processing moves to block <b>1926</b>. If the resultant is in the negative that is the card is not in the DECLINED database then processing moves to block <b>1916</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0462">In block <b>1916</b> the APPROVED database is queried to determine how many occurrences of the current card are already in the database (having previously been presented and locally authorized). This is referred to as the NUMBER OF CARD OCCURRENCE IN APPROVED DATABASE. Processing then moves to block <b>1920</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0463">In block <b>1920</b> a comparison of the NUMBER OF CARD OCCURRENCES IN APPROVED DATABASE is made to the MAXIMUM OCCURRENCES WARNING LIMIT. Processing then moves to decision block <b>1918</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0464">The MAXIMUM OCCURRENCES WARNING LIMIT is a remotely programmable preset variable that indicates the number of repeat occurrences the same card number can be presented for local authorization before a remote authorization is forced and or the payment identification data (card) declined. In an exemplary embodiment, it may be desirable to accept for local authorization a card no more than 2 time before that card will be authorized at a remote location. The presumption is that only the remote location has access to real time card data validity. In that case a card may be locally authorized that is in fact not a valid active card. To minimize the risk of authorizing a bad card the MAXIMUM OCCURRENCES WARNING LIMIT can be set as desired to limit exposure on a bad card. For example and not limitation the MAXIMUM OCCURRENCE WARNING LIMIT can be set to two. In this case the card will be accepted and locally authorized twice before a remote authorization step is forced.</p>
  <p num="p-0465">In decision block <b>1918</b> a test is performed to determine if the NUMBER OF CARD OCCURRENCES IN APPROVED DATABASE exceed the MAXIMUM OCCURRENCE WARNING LIMIT. If the resultant is in the affirmative that is the NUMBER OF CARD OCCURRENCES IN APPROVED DATABASE exceed the MAXIMUM OCCURRENCE WARNING LIMIT then processing moves to block <b>1926</b>. If the resultant is in the negative that is the NUMBER OF CARD OCCURRENCES IN APPROVED DATABASE does not exceed the MAXIMUM OCCURRENCE WARNING LIMIT then processing moves to block <b>1922</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0466">In block <b>1922</b> the card data is added to the APPROVED database and the transaction is approved. Processing moves to block <b>1924</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0467">In block <b>1924</b> the transaction is authorized and the user is allowed to utilize the vending equipment, referred to as a transaction, transaction data, and or completing a transaction. The routine is then exited.</p>
  <p num="p-0468">In block <b>1926</b> system <b>500</b> initiates a remote data communication for the purpose of authorizing the current card with the processing bureau <b>804</b>. Processing moves to decision block <b>1930</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0469">In decision block <b>1930</b> a test is performed to determine if during the remote authorization process a communication line failure was detected. Such a failure could include for example and not limitation a phone line being busy or unavailable, or a server being unavailable. If the resultant is in the affirmative that is a communication line failure was detected then processing moves to block <b>1928</b>. If the resultant is in the negative that is a communication line failure was not detected then processing moves to decision block <b>1934</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0470">In block <b>1928</b> the APPROVED database is queried to determine how many occurrences of the current card are already in the database (having previously been presented and locally authorized). This is referred to as the NUMBER OF CARD OCCURRENCE IN APPROVED DATABASE. Processing then moves to block <b>1932</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0471">In block <b>1932</b> a comparison of the NUMBER OF CARD OCCURRENCES IN APPROVED DATABASE is made to the MAXIMUM OCCURRENCES STOP LIMIT. Processing then moves to decision block <b>1918</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0472">The MAXIMUM OCCURRENCES STOP LIMIT is a remotely programmable preset variable that indicates the number of times the same card number can be presented for local authorization before a remote authorization is forced. In an exemplary embodiment, it may be desirable to accept for local authorization a card no more then three times before that card will be authorized at a remote location.</p>
  <p num="p-0473">The difference between the MAXIMUM OCCURRENCE WARNING LIMIT and the MAXIMUM OCCURRENCE STOP LIMIT is that when the WARNING limit is exceeded a remote authorization will be attempted. If the remote authorization attempt fails due to communication related issues then the MAXIMUM OCCURRENCE STOP LIMIT would serve as a determinant in approving or denying the current transaction. If the MAXIMUM OCCURRENCE STOP LIMIT is not exceeded the local authorization processing will continue. If the MAXIMUM OCCURRENCE STOP LIMIT is exceeded the card will be declined. This feature in affect minimizes the possibility of inadvertently declining a card based on a communication line failure.</p>
  <p num="p-0474">In an exemplary embodiment it can be desirable not to decline a user's payment identification data because the system <b>500</b> was unable to establish a data communication connection with a remote location, wherein such a data communication with a remote location is being attempted for the purpose of authorizing the user's payment identification data (card). In this regard, in an attempt to limit the exposure of locally approving a user's payment identification data while accommodating the possibility of the system <b>500</b> being unable to remotely authorize, for communication failure reasons, the user's payment identification data with a remote location a MAXIMUM OCCURRENCES STOP LIMIT can be implemented.</p>
  <p num="p-0475">The MAXIMUM OCCURRENCES STOP LIMIT can be a number higher than the MAXIMUM OCCURRENCE WARNING LIMIT for example and not limitation the MAXIMUM OCCURRENCE WARNING LIMIT can be set to 2 and the MAXIMUM OCCURRENCES STOP LIMIT can be set to 3. In this example when a user presents payment identification data for the third time the MAXIMUM OCCURRENCE WARNING LIMIT is exceeded forcing a remote authorization attempt. If for communication reasons (busy signal on the phone line, network is down, etc.) a remote authorization fails—since the MAXIMUM OCCURRENCES STOP LIMIT is set to 3 and is not exceeded by the user's third presentation of the payment identification data the transaction is locally authorized and approved.</p>
  <p num="p-0476">If in another exemplary embodiment, the user now were to present the payment identification data for a fourth time and a remote authorization failed for communication reasons, that is a data connection with the remote location could not be established, then the transaction would be locally declined. This authorization decline occurring since now the NUMBER OF CARD OCCURRENCE IN APPROVED DATABASE exceeds the MAXIMUM OCCURRENCES STOP LIMIT.</p>
  <p num="p-0477">In decision block <b>1940</b> a test is performed to determine if the NUMBER OF CARD OCCURRENCES IN APPROVED DATABASE exceed the MAXIMUM OCCURRENCE STOP LIMIT. If the resultant is in the affirmative that is the NUMBER OF CARD OCCURRENCES IN APPROVED DATABASE exceed the MAXIMUM OCCURRENCE STOP LIMIT then processing moves to block <b>1942</b>. If the resultant is in the negative that is the NUMBER OF CARD OCCURRENCES IN APPROVED DATABASE does not exceed the MAXIMUM OCCURRENCE STOP LIMIT then processing moves to block <b>1944</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0478">In block <b>1944</b> the card data is added to the APPROVED database and the transaction is approved. Processing moves to block <b>1946</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0479">In block <b>1946</b> the transaction is authorized and the user is allowed to utilize the vending equipment. The routine is then exited.</p>
  <p num="p-0480">In decision block <b>1934</b> a test is made to determine if the card was approved. If the resultant is in the affirmative that is the card was approved then processing moves to block <b>1938</b>.

  <p num="p-0483">In an exemplary embodiment locally authorized and remotely authorized payment identification data and cashless transaction data can be accumulated in the system <b>500</b> over time. At a periodic interval, for example and not limitation once a day, the authorized transactions can be data communicated to a remote data processing resource. A remote data processing resource can be a global network based data processing resource.</p>
  <p num="p-0484">In an exemplary embodiment, the authorized transactions can be data communicated to a remote data processing resource by way of a first data communication to a data processing device, such as a PDA <b>372</b>, a wireless phone <b>368</b>, a pager <b>370</b>, or other similar or suitable data processing device. The data processing device can then data communicate the authorized transactions including the payment identification data and transaction data to the remote data processing resource. Data communication between system <b>500</b> and the remote data processing resource by way of the data processing device can be by wired or wireless methods, and can include physically carrying the data processing device from the system <b>500</b> to a remote location where data communication with a remote data processing resource can be effectuated. This embodiment can allow a vending equipment service person to visit the vending equipment, download payment identification data and transaction data into a data processing device, return to for example a service vehicle of central office, and download the payment identification data and transaction data to a remote data processing device.</p>
  <p num="p-0485">Alternatively the payment identification data and transaction data can be wired or wireless data communicated from the system <b>500</b> to the remote data processing resource.</p>
  <p num="p-0486">The authorized transactions, both locally authorized and remotely authorized, can be processed by the remote data processing resource. The locally authorized transaction can be data communicated to a remote location, such as a processing bureau, for reauthorization first and then subsequent settlement with the remote location. The remotely authorized transaction, having previously received an approval code from the remote location, typically need only be data communicated to the remote location for settlement. Settlement is the process of causing charges to be billed to the user or owner of the payment identification data and payment being effectuated to the merchant for goods and services rendered or vended in the transaction.</p>
  <p num="p-0487">The reauthorization processing can include obtaining a new approval code from a remote location. Such an approval code might have been obtained by way of the system <b>500</b> initially if the payment identification data was first authorized with the remote location in lieu of having locally authorized the transaction. Remote authorization can be refer to as obtaining an approval code from a remote location.</p>
  <p num="p-0488">Benefits of the local authorization process compared to the remote authorization process can be reduced authorization time. Typically a local authorization can be effectuated in real time virtually instantaneously, whereas remote authorization can take several to many or more seconds to establish a connection and data communicate with a remote location.</p>
  <p num="p-0489">In an exemplary embodiment the system <b>500</b> authorizes locally and or remotely the payment identification data for the cashless transaction. The authorized payment identification data and cashless transaction data (transaction data) can then be data communicated to a remote data processing resource for reauthorization and or settlement. The locally authorized payment identification data and transaction data requires reauthorization and settlement. The remotely authorized payment identification data and transaction data require only settlement.</p>
  <p num="p-0490">In another exemplary embodiment the system <b>500</b> having a plurality of locally and or remotely authorized payment identification data and transaction data can first elect to reauthorize the locally authorized transactions and or elect to settle both the locally and remotely authorized transactions with the remote location prior to data communicating to the remote data processing resource. In this regard, the remote data processing resource can still implement a reauthorization process of certain transactions but this process will only confirm that such locally authorized transactions have been previously reauthorized and that all transactions have been settled. One advantage of processing transactions in this manner can be to decentralize transaction processing. In this regard, reliance for reauthorization and settlement of transactions can be distributed across a plurality of system <b>500</b> in lieu of concentrating the reauthorization and settlement process on a remote data processing resource.</p>
  <p num="p-0491">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> there is shown an international transaction authorization and settlement routine <b>1400</b>. Standard transaction processing fees for low cost sales can be significant. International card processing can incur even more transaction processing fees in the form of currency conversion fees. Currency conversion fees are fees incurred when currency is converted from one countries currency to another. To minimize the standard transaction processing fees and to minimize and or eliminate the currency conversion fees routine <b>1400</b> can be implemented. Processing begins in block <b>1402</b>.</p>

  <p num="p-0497">In block <b>1410</b> a batch of locally authorized transactions is data communicated to a remote location (the remote location being another country) by way of a network connection. In this regard locally authorized transactions can be moved from the country in which the vending sale occurred to the country where the transactions will be processed with a processing center. Processing then moves to block <b>1412</b>. The transfer of locally authorized transactions can occur at a predetermined time including hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or other desirable time interval.</p>
  <p num="p-0498">In block <b>1412</b> the server receiving the locally authorized transactions from a plurality of remotely located system <b>500</b> authorizes and settles each locally authorized transaction. The process of settlement effectuates the transfer of funds from the cardholder to the merchant. In this regard, the transaction is authorized and settled in the same country currency avoiding any currency conversion fees. Additionally, since transactions can be aggregated from a plurality of system <b>500</b> in a plurality of countries the transaction and currency volumes increase. These increases in transaction volumes coupled with efficient batching of transactions to the processing bureau can result in the lowest possible standard transaction processing fees.

  <p num="p-0678">In block <b>3016</b> the computing platform <b>802</b> accounts for the VEND SUCCESS and or VEND FAILURE. VEND FAILURES typically end a session and or transaction. The MDB TRANSACTION STRING must be cleared by the computing platform before another cashless vend can be transacted. Clearing the MDB TRANSACTION STRING can be effectuated by way of the @&lt;esc&gt;C command. Processing then moves to block <b>3018</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0679">In block <b>3018</b> a determination is made as to whether the transaction should be ended or a multi-vend session should continue. If a multi-vend session is to continue then processing moves back to block <b>3004</b> initiated by the computing platform <b>802</b> issuing to the system <b>500</b> a begin session command @&lt;esc&gt;S and system <b>500</b> issuing a MDB BEGIN SESSION message to the vending equipment VMC.</p>
  <p num="p-0680">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23I</figref> there is shown MDB TRANSACTION STRING messaging when a system <b>500</b> initiates a cashless vend while in the VEND ACTIVE mode ‘ON’ routine <b>3100</b>. Shown in the figure are messages being passed between a system <b>500</b> (SYSTEM <b>500</b>) and the vending equipment VMC (RESPONSE FROM VENDING EQUIPMENT).</p>
  <p num="p-0681">Routine <b>3100</b> is shown as example not a limitation, variations in the routine arise based on vending application, system <b>500</b> configuration, computing platform <b>802</b> configuration, vending equipment configuration, and or other setup operational, or configuration issues. In an exemplary embodiment, G4, EPORT, a system <b>500</b>, a payment module, or audit-credit-interactive device, are all referred to as a system <b>500</b>. The cooperation between system <b>500</b> and a computing platform <b>802</b> to transact a cashless transaction can be referred to as a cashless transaction processing system.</p>
  <p num="p-0682">System <b>500</b> can initiate a vending session by receiving certain commands from an interconnected computing platform <b>802</b> or by the system <b>500</b> initiating the vending session. An option is available for the system <b>500</b> or computing platform <b>802</b> to essentially setup the system <b>500</b> in a master mode, wherein the system <b>500</b> essentially runs the cashless transaction and the computing platform <b>802</b> merely monitors the cashless transaction and vend cycle by way of data communication with the system <b>500</b>. In this regard, the system <b>500</b> effectuates the ability of the computing platform <b>802</b> to monitor a cashless vending transaction.</p>
  <p num="p-0683">If the VEND ASSIST mode is ‘ON’ the computing platform <b>802</b> can still play a role in APPROVING and DENYING a cashless vend and setting the vend price as previously detailed. In the VEND ASSIST mode ‘OFF’ the system <b>500</b> will determine whether or not to APPROVE or DENY a vend request made by the vending equipment VMC.</p>
  <p num="p-0684">The system <b>500</b> configuration that turns the system <b>500</b> into the master device for transacting cashless vending transactions can be referred to as the VEND ACTIVE mode ‘ON’, wherein VEND ACTIVE mode ‘OFF’ indicates the system <b>500</b> is a data conduit and not running the transactions and VEND ACTIVE mode ‘ON’ indicates the system <b>500</b> is running the transaction. This example reflects a VEND ACTIVE mode ‘ON’ cashless transaction vending cycle. Processing begins in block <b>3102</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0685">In block <b>3102</b> a session is begun by the computing platform <b>802</b> interconnected with the system <b>500</b> and or by system <b>500</b>. A session can be started in a number of ways including @&lt;esc&gt;B BEGIN A SESSION command, a valid card swipe or payment identification data presentation, an @&lt;esc&gt;A+STX+CARD-xxxxxx+ETX+LRC command where ‘xxxxxx’ is card or payment identification data, an @&lt;esc&gt;A+STX+DIAL-xxxxxx+ETX+LRC dial-a-vend command, or other suitable start session methods. In response the system <b>500</b> issues a MDB BEGIN SESSION message command to the vending equipment VMC. Processing then moves to block <b>3104</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0686">In block <b>3104</b> the vending equipment starts a vending session. System <b>500</b> monitoring the MDB bus connection between the system <b>500</b> and VMC can determine and update the MDB TRANSACTION STRING accordingly. MDB bus data and MDB TRANSACTION STRING updating can be referred to as reporting or reporting data. Reporting data can be communicated to block <b>3006</b>. Processing then moves to block <b>3110</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0687">In block <b>3106</b> the system <b>500</b> updates the MDB TRANSACTION STRING to reflect the operational state changes and pricing information. The MDB TRANSACTION STRING is available to an interconnected computing platform <b>802</b> through issue of appropriate MDB TRANSACTION STRING send commands, such as @&lt;esc&gt;H, and @&lt;esc&gt;V. A sample MDB TRANSACTION STRING could be ‘S0001250000000000C’.</p>
  <p num="p-0688">In block <b>3110</b> when a user makes a vending selection the VMC sends by way of the MDB bus connection between system <b>500</b> and the VMC a MDB VEND REQUEST message. This message typically contains the column or button select by the user and the vending equipment price set for this item. The VEND REQUEST is reported to the system <b>500</b> and processing moves to block <b>3120</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0689">In block <b>3108</b> the system <b>500</b> updates the MDB TRANSACTION STRING to reflect the operational state changes and pricing information. The MDB TRANSACTION STRING is available to an interconnected computing platform <b>802</b> through issue of appropriate MDB TRANSACTION STRING send commands, such as @&lt;esc&gt;H, and @&lt;esc&gt;V. A sample MDB TRANSACTION STRING could be ‘V0001250001150001R’ (VEND ASSIST mode ‘ON’). In a VEND ASSIST mode ‘OFF’ configuration the system <b>500</b> would typically respond to the VMC MDB VEND REQUEST with a MDB VEND APPROVED response without the computing platform <b>802</b> having an opportunity to APPROVE or DENY the vend request made by the vending equipment VMC.</p>
  <p num="p-0690">In this example the VEND ASSIST mode is ‘ON’ the MDB STATE flag is set to ‘V’ to indicate a vend is occurring, and the MDB flag state is set to ‘R’ for REQUEST VEND APPROVE. This is the indication to computing platform <b>802</b> and or system <b>500</b> that in order to effectuate vending of the item or deny vending of the item a VEND APPROVE or VEND DENIED command respectively must be issued to the VMC from the system <b>500</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0691">In an exemplary embodiment, a computing platform <b>802</b> interconnect with system <b>500</b> can determine from the MDB TRANSACTION string the item selected and item price. For example and not limitation, the MDB TRANSACTION STRING ‘V 000125 000115 0001 R’ indicates that the MAX VEND PRICE in the vending equipment is ‘000125’ or $1.25, the price set in the vending equipment for the user item selected is ‘000115’ or $1.15, and the user selected item or column id ‘<b>0001</b>’ item or column number one. The computing platform <b>802</b> and or system <b>500</b> can in part use this information to determine whether to issue the VEND APPROVE or VEND DENIED command to the VMC.</p>
  <p num="p-0692">For example and not limitation, a determination by the computing platform <b>802</b> to VEND APPROVE the vend request is made. In this regard, the computing platform <b>802</b> data communicates to the system <b>500</b> the @&lt;esc&gt;A+STX+SALE-00100+ETX+LRC where ‘00100’ is the desired sale amount in this case $1.00. System <b>500</b> receiving the VEND APPROVE command from computing platform <b>802</b> issues the MDB VEND APPROVED message to the vending equipments VMC.</p>
  <p num="p-0693">In block <b>3120</b> the VEND APPROVED response is received at the VMC from the system <b>500</b>. The vending equipment in accordance with VMC programming initiates the vend product cycle. By the VMC acknowledging the VEND APPROVED message from the system <b>500</b>, the system <b>500</b> can now indicate a cashless vend is pending. A report is passed back to block <b>3112</b> such that system <b>500</b> updates the MDB TRANSACTION STRING to reflect the operational state changes and pricing information. The MDB TRANSACTION STRING is available to an interconnected computing platform <b>802</b> through issue of appropriate MDB TRANSACTION STRING send commands, such as @&lt;esc&gt;H, and @&lt;esc&gt;V. A sample MDB TRANSACTION STRING could be ‘V0001250001000001P’. Processing moves to block <b>3114</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0694">In block <b>3114</b> the vending equipment either completes or fails to complete a vending cycle. A report is passed to block <b>3116</b> such that system <b>500</b> updates the MDB TRANSACTION STRING to reflect the operational state changes and pricing information. The MDB TRANSACTION STRING is available to an interconnected computing platform <b>802</b> through issue of appropriate MDB TRANSACTION STRING send commands, such as @&lt;esc&gt;H, and @&lt;esc&gt;V. A sample MDB TRANSACTION STRING could be ‘V0001250001000001V’ for vend complete a failed vend cycle could be reflected in a MDB TRANSACTION STRING as ‘V0001250001000001F’. Processing then moves to block <b>3116</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0695">In block <b>3116</b> the system <b>500</b> accounts for the VEND SUCCESS and or VEND FAILURE. VEND FAILURES typically end a session and or transaction. Processing then moves to block <b>3018</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0696">In block <b>3118</b> a determination is made as to whether the transaction should be ended or a multi-vend session should continue. If a multi-vend session is to continue then processing moves back to block <b>3004</b> by the system <b>500</b> issuing a MDB BEGIN SESSION message to the vending equipment VMC.</p>
  <p num="p-0697">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23J</figref> there is shown a computing platform and system <b>500</b> exchange to capture MDB bus messages routine <b>3200</b>.

  <p num="p-0699">System <b>500</b> can initiate a MDB CAPTURE mode diagnostic routine. In this regard, MDB message data passed between the system <b>500</b> (denoted by ‘G4’ in the sample output block <b>3218</b>) and the vending equipment VMC (VMC) can be captured and dumped to computing platform <b>802</b> for analysis. In an exemplary embodiment, a computing platform <b>802</b> can be a laptop computer, or other similar type of device.</p>
  <p num="p-0700">The MDB CAPTURE mode can be useful in determining the correct MDB RESPONSE and MDB INTERVAL settings.

  <p num="p-0701">Routine <b>3200</b> is an exemplary embodiment of the use of the MDB CAPTURE to capture initialization, and setup data as a system <b>500</b> and VMC exchange data after a system <b>500</b> hardware reset (@&lt;esc&gt;K command execution). Processing begins in block <b>3202</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0702">In block <b>3202</b> the computing platform sends the Toggle MDB CAPTURE command @&lt;esc&gt;1 to the system <b>500</b>. Processing then moves to block <b>3204</b>.</p>

In response, to receiving the MDB CAPTURE command @&lt;esc&gt;1 from the computing platform <b>802</b> the system <b>500</b> may respond by sending the response message STX+ON-1+ETX+LRC.

  <p num="p-0704">In block <b>3206</b> the computing platform <b>802</b> for example and not limitation, can send the system <b>500</b> the hardware reset command @&lt;esc&gt;K. This causes the system <b>500</b> to go through a hardware reset and attempt to reestablish data communication with the interconnected vending equipment VMC—this is the MDB data desired to be captured. Processing then moves to block <b>3208</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0705">In block <b>3208</b> the system <b>500</b> first responds to the receipt of the @&lt;esc&gt;K command by sending the computing platform <b>802</b> the response message STX+OK-K+ETX+LRC.
