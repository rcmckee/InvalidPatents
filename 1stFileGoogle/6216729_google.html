    <heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading> <p>This application claims the priority of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/202,745, filed May 8, 2000.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The invention relates to mechanical valves and, more particularly, to check valves that prevent the movement of fluids in a hydraulic system when the pressure of the fluid is less than a predetermined value.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Conventional check valves permit liquids or gases to flow in only one direction. Such check valves are present in hydraulic systems, typically in mobile and fixed equipment, to control the flow path of fluids in the system. Check valves are also used in a variety of pumps to prevent the backward flow of liquids.</p>
    <p>The hydraulic system is typically connected to other, auxiliary systems that may share a common fluid path with the hydraulic system. When a leak or hose failure occurs in the hydraulic system, fluid may also leak from the other systems that are connected to the hydraulic system and result in further fluid loss as well as cause the auxiliary systems to fail.</p>
    <p>It is therefore desirable to prevent the loss of fluid from the auxiliary systems when a fluid is lost from the hydraulic system.</p>
    <p>Further, fluid losses in the hydraulic system may be exacerbated by the auxiliary systems. When, for example, there is a back pressure from the auxiliary systems, pressurized fluid reservoirs or the like, the fluid pressure from the auxiliary systems aggravate any leaks present in the hydraulic system.</p>
    <p>Also, when there is valve leakage from the auxiliary systems, fluid will also be lost from the hydraulic system.</p>
    <p>Thus, there is also a need to automatically isolate the hydraulic system from the accessory systems to further fluid loss when there is a leak in either the hydraulic system or in an auxiliary system.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention provides a bidirectional check valve that blocks the flow of fluid in a given direction when the fluid pressure in that direction falls below a predetermined value.</p>
    <p>According to an aspect of the invention, a bidirectional check valve controls movement of fluid. A valve body has at least an opening and a further opening therein and has a passage connecting the opening and the further opening. A poppet is disposed within the passage of the valve body and is arranged such that at least a portion of an outer surface of the poppet and at least a portion of a wall of the passage of the valve body define at least one channel. The poppet has at least an opening therein in proximity to the opening in the valve body and has a passage connecting to the opening in the poppet. A spring is coupled to the poppet. The spring is arranged to drive the poppet in a direction such that when fluid passing through the opening in the valve body exerts a force on the poppet that is less than the spring force, a further portion of the outer surface of the poppet contacts a further portion of the passage wall of the valve body and prevents the fluid from flowing from the opening in the valve body into the channel. When the fluid exerts a force on the poppet that is greater than the spring force, the poppet is directed away from the further portion of the passage wall and permits the fluid to flow from the opening in the valve body through the channel and to the further opening in the valve body. A further poppet is disposed within the passage formed in the first mentioned poppet. The further spring is arranged such that at least a portion of an outer surface of the further poppet and at least a portion of a passage wall of the poppet define at least one further channel. The outer surface of the further poppet has at least an opening therein that connects to a passage formed within the further poppet. The passage within the further poppet connects to a further opening in the further poppet that is in proximity to the opening in the poppet. A further spring is coupled to the poppet and to the further poppet. The further spring is arranged to drive the further poppet in a further direction such that when fluid passing through the further opening in the valve body exerts a force on the further poppet that is less than the further spring force, a further portion of the outer surface of the further poppet blocks the further channel and prevents the fluid from flowing from the further opening in the valve body into the further channel. When the fluid exerts a force on the further poppet that is greater than the further spring force, the further portion of the outer surface of the further poppet is directed away from the further opening in the valve body to open the further channel and permit the fluid to flow from the further opening in the valve body through the further channel, the, at least, one opening in the further poppet, the further passage in the further poppet, the further opening in the further poppet and the opening in the poppet to the opening of the valve body.</p>
    <p>According to another aspect of the invention, a hydraulic apparatus includes one or more supply lines, one or more return lines, a pump configured to drive fluid through the supply line at a supply pressure, and a flow component disposed between the supply line and the return line and providing a pressure differential in the fluid such that a return pressure in the return line is less than the supply pressure. The bidirectional check valve is disposed within the supply line and/or the return line.</p>
    <p>Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>

    <p>FIG. 6 shows a hydraulic system of the excavator vehicle shown in FIG. 5 that is modified to incorporate the valve of FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b>.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>FIG. 1 shows an exploded view of a bidirectional check valve <b>100</b>, which is also shown in FIG. 2 with its components assembled, according to an embodiment of the invention. The bidirectional check valve includes a valve block <b>103</b> having an opening or port <b>116</b> at one end and another opening or port <b>117</b> at its opposite end. The openings <b>116</b> and <b>117</b> are connected by a passage <b>115</b> that extends throughout the valve block. Though two ports are shown, the bidirectional check valve may include additional ports.</p>
    <p>A poppet <b>104</b> is arranged within the passage <b>115</b> of the valve block or body <b>103</b>, such as by insertion through the opening <b>117</b>. The poppet is typically held in place by a portion of its outer wall <b>130</b> which contacts the passage wall <b>128</b>. One or more flutes or grooves <b>132</b> are formed in the outer wall <b>120</b> and, together with the wall <b>128</b>, define one or more channels <b>139</b>. The poppet also includes a passage <b>118</b> having an opening <b>119</b> at one end and an opening <b>120</b> at an opposite end. The outer wall <b>130</b> of the poppet also includes a tapered portion <b>134</b> near the opening <b>119</b> which is configured so that at least a portion of the tapered region may fit snugly against a narrowed portion <b>129</b> of the inner wall <b>128</b> of the valve block.</p>
    <p>A spring <b>105</b> is disposed within the passage <b>118</b> along a passage wall <b>133</b> of the poppet <b>104</b> and abuts a ledge <b>135</b> formed in the passage wall near the opening <b>119</b> of the poppet.</p>
    <p>Also located within the passage <b>118</b>, adjacent to the spring <b>105</b>, is a further poppet <b>106</b>. A passage <b>122</b> is formed within the further poppet <b>106</b> and has an opening <b>124</b> at one end of the further poppet. One or more openings <b>123</b> are present in the outer wall of the further poppet <b>106</b>. The openings <b>123</b> open to an opposing end of the passage <b>122</b> which is adjacent to a tapered end <b>144</b> of the further poppet.</p>
    <p>A valve seat <b>108</b> is arranged within the passage <b>118</b> adjacent to the tapered end of the further poppet <b>106</b>. An opening <b>140</b> extends through the width of the valve seat <b>108</b> and includes a widened portion <b>144</b> at an end of the valve seat that is nearest the tapered end of the further poppet. The widened portion <b>144</b> of the opening and the tapered end of the further poppet together define a channel <b>148</b> between the valve seat <b>108</b> and openings <b>123</b> when the further poppet is displaced from the valve seat. A seal <b>107</b>, such as an o-ring, is located in a groove or notch formed in the outer wall of the valve seat and prevents fluid leakage along the outer wall of the valve seat.</p>
    <p>A retaining ring <b>109</b>, such as a snap ring, is seated within the passage <b>118</b> of the poppet <b>104</b> and is located adjacent to another end of the valve seat <b>108</b> to hold the valve seat in its position. A spring <b>110</b> is also provided and has a portion that is inserted into the passage <b>118</b> and abuts the retaining ring <b>109</b>. Another portion of the spring <b>110</b> extends beyond the poppet into the passage <b>115</b> of the valve block <b>103</b> and mates with an adapter <b>111</b>. The adapter is also disposed within the passage <b>115</b> of the valve block <b>103</b>. An opening <b>150</b> extends through the width of the adapter and includes a ledge <b>152</b> upon which the spring <b>110</b> is seated. A further retaining ring <b>112</b> is arranged within the passage <b>115</b> and is adjacent to the adapter <b>111</b>.</p>
    <p>Typically, an end adapter <b>111</b> is secured to the valve block <b>103</b> at opening <b>116</b>, such as by threads or other types of connections, to permit the valve block to be connected to a hydraulic line or other hydraulic leads, for example. To prevent fluid leaks, a seal <b>102</b>, which may be an o-ring, is provided between the end adapter <b>101</b> and the valve block <b>103</b>.</p>
    <p>Another end adapter <b>114</b> may be secured to the valve block <b>103</b> at opening <b>117</b> using threads or other types of connections, for example. Another seal <b>113</b>, such as an o-ring, is provided between the end adapter <b>114</b> and the valve block <b>103</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 2 shows the bidirectional check valve <b>100</b> of the invention when the valve is closed in both directions to the passage of fluid. The valve <b>100</b> is closed in both directions under any of the following conditions: (1) when no fluid is present at both sides of the valve, (2) when no fluid is present at the opening <b>116</b> of the valve and the fluid pressure at the opening <b>117</b> is less than the force exerted by the spring <b>105</b>, (3) when no fluid is present at opening <b>117</b> and the fluid pressure at opening <b>116</b> is less than the force exerted by the spring <b>110</b>, and (4) when the fluid pressure on each side of the valve is less than the force exerted by springs <b>105</b> and <b>110</b>, respectively.</p>
    <p>In this configuration, the spring <b>110</b> drives the poppet <b>104</b> in the direction of opening <b>116</b> and secures part or all of the tapered end of the outer wall <b>130</b> of the poppet <b>104</b> against at least a part of the narrowed end <b>129</b> of the wall <b>128</b> of the passage <b>115</b> so that the flow of fluid from opening <b>116</b> into the channels <b>134</b> is cut off. Also, the spring <b>105</b> drives the further poppet <b>106</b> in the direction of opening <b>117</b> and secures part or all of the tapered end of the outer wall of the further poppet against at least a part of the widened end of the opening in the valve seat <b>108</b> so that the flow of fluid from opening <b>117</b> into the openings <b>123</b> of the further poppet <b>106</b> is cut off.</p>
    <p>FIG. 3 depicts the bidirectional check valve <b>100</b> when the valve is open in one direction to permit the passage of fluid from the opening <b>116</b> to the opening <b>117</b>, namely when the fluid pressure at opening <b>116</b> is greater than the force exerted by the spring <b>110</b>.</p>
    <p>The force of the fluid drives the poppet <b>104</b> in the direction of opening <b>117</b> and moves the tapered end <b>134</b> of the outer wall of the poppet <b>104</b> away from the narrowed end <b>129</b> of the wall of the passage <b>115</b> which permits the flow of fluid from opening <b>116</b> into the channels <b>139</b>, past the end of the poppet <b>104</b> and through the opening <b>117</b>.</p>
    <p>The spring <b>105</b> holds the tapered end <b>144</b> of the outer wall of the further poppet <b>106</b> against the face of the widened end <b>142</b> of the opening in the valve seat <b>108</b> and prevents the flow of fluid in the opposite direction.</p>
    <p>FIG. 4 shows the bidirectional check valve <b>100</b> of the invention when the valve is open in the opposite direction to permit the passage of fluid from the opening <b>117</b> to the opening <b>116</b>, namely when the fluid pressure at opening <b>117</b> is greater than the force exerted by the spring <b>105</b>.</p>
    <p>The force of the fluid drives the further poppet <b>106</b> in the direction of opening <b>116</b> and moves the tapered end <b>144</b> of the further poppet away from the widened end <b>142</b> of the opening in the valve seat <b>108</b> which permits the flow of fluid from the opening <b>117</b> through opening <b>150</b> of the adapter <b>111</b> and opening <b>140</b> of the valve seat <b>108</b>, and into the channel <b>148</b> formed between the outer wall <b>146</b> of the further poppet and the wall <b>133</b> of the passage within the poppet. The fluid then flows through the openings <b>123</b> into the passage <b>122</b> within the further poppet and then through the opening <b>119</b> of the poppet to the opening <b>116</b> of the valve block.</p>
    <p>The spring <b>110</b> holds the tapered end of the outer wall <b>130</b> of the poppet <b>104</b> against the narrowed end <b>129</b> of the wall <b>128</b> of the passage <b>115</b> and blocks the flow of fluid in the opposite direction.</p>
    <p>Advantageously, the bidirectional check valve of the invention is a self-contained device that may be installed in a fluid line or conduit, such as in a fluid powered hydraulic system. As a further advantage, the direction of fluid flow through the valve is reversible, as is the direction in which fluid flow is blocked.</p>
    <p>An additional advantage is that the valve closes in a given direction whenever the fluid pressure decreases to less than a predetermined value. Thus, when a leak occurs in a hose or other component in a hydraulic system that causes a drop in fluid pressure, the valve blocks the flow of fluid from other portions of the hydraulic system and maintains fluid pressure in these portions. The valve also reduces the amount of fluid that leaks out, thereby reducing possible environmental contamination from the fluid.</p>
    <p>Similarly, the valve opens in a respective direction when the fluid pressure rises above a predetermined value. The pressure at which the valve opens or closes in a given direction may be determined by the choice of spring force for the spring that checks fluid flow in that direction.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5 illustrates an example of a conventional excavator vehicle which includes a hydraulic system <b>200</b>. Hydraulically driven boom cylinders <b>201</b> <i>a</i>, <b>201</b> <i>b </i>drive a boom <b>203</b> in an upward or downward direction. A hydraulically driven arm cylinder <b>205</b> drives an arm <b>207</b> which is pivotally connected to the boom <b>203</b>. Tongs <b>209</b> are coupled to the arm <b>207</b> and are driven by hydraulic motors <b>313</b>. The tongs may be opened or closed by an operator to grasp large objects, such as cut trees, logs or beams.</p>
    <p>FIG. 6 shows an example of a closed-loop hydraulic system which may be employed in the conventional excavator vehicle of FIG. <b>5</b> and which includes one or more of the bidirectional check valves of the invention. A hydraulic pump <b>303</b> pumps hydraulic fluid from a reservoir <b>301</b> through one or more supply lines. As an example, the pump <b>303</b> drives hydraulic fluid through a supply line <b>310</b>A via valve sections <b>307</b> to a rotator <b>309</b>. The fluid is returned to the reservoir <b>301</b> via a return line <b>310</b>B and a filter <b>317</b>. Alternatively, the pump <b>303</b> drives hydraulic fluid via the valve sections <b>307</b> and a supply line <b>312</b>A to further valve sections <b>311</b> and then to hydraulic motors <b>313</b> and/or hydraulic cylinders <b>315</b>. The fluid is then returned via a return line <b>312</b>B to the reservoir <b>301</b>.</p>
    <p>The bidirectional check valves <b>305</b> of the invention may be installed in one or more of the supply lines to permit fluid to be delivered to the rotator <b>309</b> or to the valve sections <b>311</b> only when the pressure in the supply lines exceeds a predetermined value. The bidirectional check valves may also be installed in one or more of the return lines to permit fluid to be returned from the rotator <b>309</b> or from the valve sections <b>311</b> only when the pressure in the return lines exceed a predetermined value. Thus, hydraulic fluid is only supplied to the rotator <b>309</b>, the hydraulic motors <b>313</b> and the hydraulic cylinders <b>315</b> when there is sufficient fluid pressure for their proper operation. Further, when a leak occurs in one or more of the supply or return lines, the bidirectional check valves close and prevent the sudden loss of hydraulic fluid from the rotator <b>309</b>, the hydraulic motors <b>313</b> and/or the hydraulic cylinders <b>315</b>, thereby avoiding a sudden and potentially catastrophic failure.</p>
    <p>The bidirectional check valve of the invention may also be employed in other applications that use a hydraulic system.</p>
    <p>Although the present invention has been described in relation to particular embodiments thereof, many other variations and modifications and other uses may become apparent to those skilled in the art. It is preferred, therefore, that the present invention be limited not by this specific disclosure herein, but only by the appended claims.</p>
