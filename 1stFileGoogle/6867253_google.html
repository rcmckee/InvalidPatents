    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="P-00014">The invention comprises gels and articles made from multiblock copolymers having two or more midblock polymer chains which gels exhibit advantages of improved tear propagation resistance. The gels also possess high tensile strength and rapid return from high extension and can exist in an altered state of delay elastomeric recovery as it regains its original shape following high extensions or dynamic deformations. Such combination of properties are not found in gels of substantially the same rigidity made from triblock copolymers. The gels of the present invention also exhibit low set, high dimensional stability, crack, tear, craze, and creep resistance, excellent tensile strength and high elongation, long service life under shear, stress and strain and capable of withstanding repeated dynamic shear, tear and stress forces, excellent processing ability for cast molding, extruding, fiber forming film forming and spinning, non-toxic, nearly tasteless and odorless, soft and strong, optically clear, highly flexible, possessing elastic memory, substantially with little or no plasticizer bleedout. The gels are especially suitable and have advantages where resistance to dynamic stretching, shearing and tearing forces are particularly critical such as those forces acting during dental flossing, while gels in the altered state with delay elastomeric recovery from deformation and extension are excellent for use where energy and vibration damping at high impact, low frequencies, such as in running shoe cushioning designs are essential.</p>
    <p num="P-00015">Moreover, the gels can be made with selectively lower gel rigidities while achieving higher tensile strength or can be orientated to achieve high gel rigidities with lower gel tensile strengths.</p>
    <p num="P-00016">Generally, the unique tear resistant gels comprises: (I) 100 parts by weight of one or more high viscosity linear multiblock copolymers or star-shaped (or radial) multiblock copolymers having two or more midblock segments or mixtures of two or more such copolymers; optionally in combination with a selected amount of one or more of a (II) polymer or copolymer, and selected amounts of one or more compatible plasticizing oils (III) sufficient to achieve gel rigidities of from less than about 2 gram Bloom to about 1,800 gram Bloom and higher.</p>
    <p num="P-00017">The linear and star-shaped multiblock copolymers comprises one or more poly(ethylene) segment containing copolymer(s) which can exhibit crystallinity with glassy end block (A<sup>n</sup>) of a monoalkenyl arene compounds, more specifically, a monovinyl aromatic compounds, and midblocks (Z) comprising two or more segment polymer chains of poly(ethylene), poly(butylene), poly(propylene), poly(ethylene-butylene), and poly(ethylene-propylene).</p>
    <p num="P-00018">The (I) linear copolymers are characterized as having a Brookfield Viscosity cP(mPa•S) value at 5 weight percent solids solution in toluene at 30° C. of from less than about 40 cps to about 150 cps and higher, advantageously from about 40 cps to about 60 cps and higher, more advantageously from about 50 cps to about 80 cps and higher, still more advantageously from about 70 cps to about 110 cps and higher, and even more advantageously from about 90 cps to about 180 cps and higher.</p>
    <p num="P-00019">The (I) star-shaped copolymers are characterized as having a Brookfield Viscosity cP(mPa•S) value at 5 weight percent solids solution in toluene at 30° C. of from about 150 cps to about 380 cps and higher, advantageously from about 150 cps to about 260 cps and higher, more advantageously from about 200 cps to about 580 cps and higher, and still more advantageously from about 500 cps to about 1,000 cps and higher.</p>
    <p num="P-00020">As used herein, the term “gel rigidity” in gram Bloom is determined by the gram weight required to depress a gel a distance of 4 mm with a piston having a cross-sectional area of 1 square centimeter at 23° C.</p>

    <p num="P-00034">Legge's paper teaches the development of (conventional substantially amorphous elastomer mid segment) SEBS triblock copolymers. In the polymerization of butadiene by alkyllithium initiators, 1,4-addition or 1,2-addition polymers, mixtures, can be obtained. In forming styrene butadiene triblock copolymers involving the addition of solvating agents such as ethers just before the final styrene charge is added, any excess of ethers can alter the polybutadiene structure from a 1,4-cis or trans structure to a 1,2- or 3,4-addition polymer. Using difunctional coupling agent would give linear block copolymers and multifuntional agents would give star-shaped or radial block copolymers. Hydrogenation of the 1,4-polybutadiene structure yields polyethylene, while that of the 1,2-polybutadiene yields polybutylene. The resulting polyethylene will be essentially identical with linear, high-density polyethylene with a melting point, Tm, of about 136° C. Hydrogenation of 1,2-polybutadiene would yield atactic poly(1-butene)(polybutylene). The Tg of polybutylene is around −18° C. Random mixtures of ethylene and butylene units in the chain would suppress crystallinity arising from polyethylene sequences. The objective for a good elastomer should be to obtain a saturated olefin elastomeric segment with the lowest possible Tg and the best elastomeric properties. Such an elastomer favored using styrene as the hard-block monomer and selecting the best monomer for hydrogenation of the elastomer mid segment Using a mixture of 1,4- and 1,2-polybutadiene as the base polymer for the mid segment would result in an ethylene/butylene mid segment in the final product. The elements of selection of the midsegment composition is elastomer crystallinity and the elastomer Tg of an ethylene/butylene copolymer. Very low levels of crystallinity can be achieved around 40-50% butylene concentration. The minimum in dynamic hysteresis around 35% butylene concentration in the elastomeric copolymer. A value of 40% butylene concentration in the ethylene/butylene midsegment was chosen for the S-EB-S block copolymers.</p>
    <p num="P-00035">Clair's paper teaches that the EB midblock of conventional S-EB-S polymers is a random copolymer of ethylene and 1-butene exhibiting nearly no crystallinity in the midblock. In the preparation of ethylene-butylene (EB) copolymers, the relative proportions of ethylene and butylene in the EB copolymer chain can be controlled over a broad range from almost all ethylene to almost all butylene. When the EB copolymer is nearly all ethylene, the methylene sequences will crystallize exhibiting properties similar to low density polyethylene. In differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) curves, the melting endotherm is seen on heating and a sharp crystallization exotherm is seen on cooling. As the amount of butylene in the EB copolymer is increased, the methylene sequences are interrupted by the ethyl side chains which shorten the methylene sequences length so as to reduce the amount of crystallinity in the EB copolymer. In conventional S-EB-S polymers, the amount of 1-butene is controlled at a high enough level to make the EB copolymer midblock almost totally amorphous so as to make the copolymer rubbery and soluble in hydrocarbon solvents. Clair suggests that an S-EB-S polymer retaining at least some crystallinity in the EB copolymer midblock may be desirable. Therefore, a new family of S-EB-S polymers are developed (U.S. Pat. No. 3,772,234) in which the midblock contains a higher percentage of ethylene. The molecular weights of the new crystalline midblock segment S-EB-S polymers can vary from low molecular weight, intermediate molecular, to high molecular weight; these are designated Shell GR-3, GR-1, and GR-2 respectively. Unexpectly, the highest molecular weight polymer, GR-2 exhibits an anomalously low softening point. A broad melting endotherm is seen in the DSC curves of these polymers. The maximum in this broad endotherm occurs at about 40° C.</p>

    <p num="P-00038">Paper (18) Prevorsek, et al., using Raman spectroscopy, WAXS, SAXD, and EM analysis interprets damage tolerance of ultrastrong PE fibers attributed to the nano scale composite structure that consists of needle-like-nearly perfect crystals that are covalently bonded to a rubbery matrix with a structure remarkably similar to the structure of NACRE of abalone shells which explains the damage tolerance and impact resistance of PE fibers. PE because of its unique small repeating unit, chain flexibility, ability to undergo solid state transformation of the crystalline phase without breaking primary bonds, and its low glass transition temperature which are responsible for large strain rate effects plays a key role in the damage tolerance and fatigue resistance of structures made of PE fibers.</p>
    <p num="P-00039">Chen (19) classifies 3 distinct categories of E (approximately 20-50 wt % styrene), M (approximately 50-70 wt % styrene), &amp; S (greater than approximately 70 wt % styrene) substantially random or more appropriately pseudo-random ethylene-styrene copolymers or random copolymers of ethylene and ethylene-styrene dyads. The designated Ethylene-styrene copolymers are: E copolymers (ES16, ES24, ES27, ES28, ES28, ES30, and ES44 with styrene wt % of 15.7, 23.7, 27.3, 28.1, 39.6 &amp; 43.9 respectively), M copolymers (ES53, ES58, ES62, ES63, and ES69 with styrene wt % of 52.5, 58.1, 62.7, 62.8, and 69.2 respectively and crystallinity, % DSC, based on copolymer of 37.5, 26.6, 17.4,22.9, 19.6 and 5.0 respectively), S copolymers (ES72, ES73, and ES74 with styrene wt % of 72.7, 72.8, and 74.3 respectively). The maximum comonomer content for crystallization of about 20% is similar in other ethylene copolymers, such as in ethylene-hexene and ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers. If the comonomer can enter the crystal lattice, such as in ethylene-propylene, compositions in excess of 20 mol % comonomer can exhibit crystallinity. The molecular weight distribution of these copolymers is narrow, and the comonomer distribution is homogeneous. These copolymers exhibit high crystalline, lamellar morphologies to fringed micellar morphologies of low crystallinity. Crystallinity is determined by DSC measurements using a Rheometric DSC. Specimens weighing between 5 and 10 mg are heated from −80 to 180° C. at a rate of 10° C./min (first heating), held at 190° C. for 3 min, cooled to −80° C. at 10° C./min, held at −80° C. for 3 min, and reheated from −80° C. to 180° C. at 10° C./min (second heating). The crystallinity (wt %) is calculated from the second heating using a heat of fusion of 290 J/g for the polyethylene crystal. Contributing effects of the crystallinity include decrease volume fraction of the amorphous phase, restricted mobility of the amorphous chain segments by the crystalline domains, and higher styrene content of the amorphous phase due to segregation of styrene into the amorphous phase.

    <p num="P-00048">Advantageously, the elastomer midblock segment may have a crystallinity of at least about 20% of (—CH<sub>2</sub>—)<sup>16 </sup>units of the total mole % forming the midblocks of the block copolymer, more advantageously at least about 25%, still more advantageously at least about 30%, especially advantageously at least about 40% and especially more advantageously at least about 50% and higher. Broadly, the crystallinity of the midblocks can range from at least about 20% to about 60%, less broadly from at least about 18% to about 65%, and still less broadly from at least 22% to about 70%.</p>
    <p num="P-00049">The melting endotherm in DSC curves of the crystalline block copolymers comprising at least 20% crystallinity are much higher than conventional amorphous block copolymers. The poly(ethylene) crystalline segments or midblocks of copolymers forming the crystal gels of the invention are characterized by sufficient crystallinity as to exhibit a melting endotherm of at least about 25° C., more advantageously of about 40° C. or higher as determined by DSC curve. The maximum in the endotherm curves of the crystalline block copolymers occurs at about 40° C., but can range from greater than about 25° C. to about 60° C. and higher. The crystalline block copolymers forming the crystal gels of the invention can exhibit melting endotherms (as shown by DSC) of about 25° C. to about 75° C. and higher. More specific melting endotherm values of the crystalline midblock block copolymers include: about 28° C., 29° C., 30° C., 31° C., 32° C., 33° C., 34° C., 35° C., 36° C., 37° C., 38° C., 39° C., 40° C., 41° C., 42° C., 43° C., 44° C., 45° C., 46° C., 47° C., 48° C., 49° C., 50° C., 51° C., 52° C., 53° C., 54° C., 55° C., 56° C., 57° C., 58° C., 59° C., 60° C., 61° C., 62° C., 63° C., 64° C., 65° C., 66° C., 67° C., 68° C., 69° C., 70° C., 71° C., 72° C., 73° C., 74° C., 75° C., 76° C., 77° C., 78° C., 79° C., 80° C., 90° C., 100° C., 110° C., 120° C., and higher, whereas, the melting endotherm (DSC) for conventional amorphous midblock segment block copolymers are about 10° C. and lower.</p>
    <p num="P-00050">The melting endotherm is seen on heating and a sharp crystallization exotherm is seen on cooling. Such midblock crystallization endothermic and exothermic characteristics are missing from DSC curves of amorphous gels. The crystallization exotherm and fusion endotherm of the crystalline block copolymer gels of the invention are determined by ASTM D 3417 method.</p>
    <p num="P-00051">Generally, the method of obtaining long runs of crystalline —(CH<sub>2</sub>)— is by sequential block copolymer synthesis followed by hydrogenation. The attainment of crystal gels of the instant invention is solely due to the selective polymerization of the butadiene monomer (forming the midblocks) resulting in one or more predetermined amount of 1,4 poly(butadiene) blocks followed by sequential polymerization of additional midblocks and hydrogenation to produce one or more crystalline midblocks of the final block copolymers.</p>
    <p num="P-00052">The crystalline block copolymers are made by sequential block copolymer synthesis, the percentage of crystallinity or (—CH<sub>2</sub>—)<sup>16 </sup>units can be at least about (0.67)<sup>4 </sup>or about 20% and actual crystallinity of about 12%. For example, a selectively synthesized S-EBn-S copolymer having a ratio of 33:67 of 1,2 and 1,4 poly(butadiene) on hydrogenation will result in a midblock with a crystallinity of (0.67)<sup>4 </sup>or 20%. For sake of simplicity, when n is a subscript of -EB-, n denotes the percentage of (—CH<sub>2</sub>—)<sup>4 </sup>units, eg, n=33 or 20% crystallinity which is the percentage of (0.67)<sup>4 </sup>or “(—CH<sub>2</sub>—)<sup>16</sup>” units. Thus, when n=28 or 72% of (—CH<sub>2</sub>—)<sup>4 </sup>units, the % crystallinity is (0.72)<sup>4 </sup>or 26.87% crystallinity attributed to (—CH<sub>2</sub>—)<sup>16 </sup>units, denoted by -EB<sub>28</sub>-. As a matter of convention, and for purposes of this specification involving hydrogenated polybutadiene: the notation -E- denotes at least about 85% of (—CH<sub>2</sub>—)<sup>4 </sup>units. The notation -B- denotes at least about 70% of [—CH<sub>2</sub>—CH(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)—] units. The notation -EB- denotes between about 15 and 70% [—CH<sub>2</sub>—CH(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)—]  units. The notation -EBn- denotes n % [—CH<sub>2</sub>—CH(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)—] units. For hydrogenated polyisoprene: The notation -EP- denotes about at least 90% [—CH<sub>2</sub>—CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)—CH<sub>2</sub>—CH<sub>2</sub>—] units.</p>
    <p num="P-00053">Generally, one or more (E) midblocks can be incorporated at various positions along the midblocks of the block copolymers. The lower flexibility of block copolymer crystal gels due to (E) midblocks can be balanced by the addition of sequentially (W) midblocks. For example, the sequentially synthesized block copolymer S-E-EB-S can maintain a high degree of flexibility due to the presence of amorphous -EB- block The sequential block copolymer S-E-EB-B-S can maintain a high degree of flexibility due to the presence of amorphous -EB- and -B- midblocks. The sequential block copolymer S-E-EP-E-S can maintain a high degree of flexibility due to the presence of -EP- midblock. The sequential block copolymer S-E-B-S can maintain a high degree of flexibility due to the presence of the -B- midblock. For S-E-S, where the midblock is substantially crystalline and flexibility low, physical blending with amorphous block copolymers such as S-EB-S, S-B-S, S-EP-S, S-EB-EP-S, (S-EP)<sub>n </sub>and the like can produce more softer, less rigid, and more flexible crystal gel.</p>
    <p num="P-00054">Because of the (E) midblocks, the crystal gels of the invention exhibit different physical characteristics and improvements over substantially amorphous gels including damage tolerance, improved crack propagation resistance, improved tear resistance producing knotty tears as opposed to smooth tears, crystalline melting point of at least 28° C., improved resistance to fatigue, higher hysteresis, etc. Moreover, the crystal gels when stretched exhibit additional yielding as shown by necking caused by stress induced crystallinity. Additionally, the crystallization rates of the crystalline midblocks can be controlled and slowed depending on thermal history producing time delay recovery upon deformation.</p>
    <p num="P-00055">Regarding resistance to fatigue, fatigue (as used herein) is the decay of mechanical properties after repeated application of stress and strain. Fatigue tests give information about the ability of a material to resist the development of cracks or crazes resulting from a large number of deformation cycles. Fatigue test can be conducted by subjecting samples of amorphous and crystal gels to deformation cycles to failure (appearance of cracks, crazes, rips or tears in the gels).</p>
    <p num="P-00056">Tensile strength can be determined by extending a selected gel sample to break as measured at 180° U bend around a 5.0 mm mandrel attached to a spring scale. Likewise, tear strength of a notched sample can be determined by propagating a tear as measured at 180° U bend around a 5.0 mm diameter mandrel attached to a spring scale.</p>
    <p num="P-00057">Various block copolymers can be obtained which are amorphous, highly rubbery, and exhibiting minimum dynamic hysteresis:</p>

Due to the constraints of Tg and minimum hysteresis, conventional S-EB-S have ethylene-butylene ratios of about 60:40 with a crystallinity of about (0.6)<sup>4 </sup>or 0.129 or 12% and actual crystallinity of about 7.7%.</p>
    <heading>Block Copolymer S-EP-S</heading> <p num="P-00059">The monomer isoprene when polymerized will produce 95% 1,4 poly(isoprene)/5% 3,4 poly(isoprene) and upon hydrogenation will form amorphous, rubbery poly(ethylene-propylene) midblock and no long runs of —CH<sub>2</sub>— and no crystallinity.</p>

The actual crystallinity would be approximately about 0.2%, which is negligible and results in a good rubbery midblock.</p>
    <p num="P-00061">The polymerization of a 80/20 mixture of isoprene/butadiene monomers in suitable ether/hydrocarbon solvents to give equal amounts of 1,2 and 1,4 poly(butadiene) will upon hydrogenation produce a low crystallinity of (0.10)<sup>4 </sup>or 0.01%. The actual crystallinity would be approximately about 0.006%, which is negligible and results in a good rubbery midblock.</p>
    <p num="P-00062">The polymerization of a 20/80 mixture of isoprene/butadiene monomers in suitable ether/hydrocarbon solvents to give equal amounts of 1,2 and 1,4 poly(butadiene) will upon hydrogenation produce a low crystallinity of (0.4)<sup>4 </sup>or 2.56%.

The actual crystallinity would be approximately about 3.2%, which is negligible and results in a good rubbery midblock.</p>

    <p num="P-00080">The Z and A portions of the linear and star-shaped multiblock copolymers are incompatible and form a two or more-phase system consisting of sub-micron glassy domains (A) interconnected by flexible Z chains. These domains serve to crosslink and reinforce the structure. This physical elastomeric network structure is reversible, and heating the polymer above the softening point of the glassy domains temporarily disrupt the structure, which can be restored by lowering the temperature.</p>
    <p num="P-00081">Theory notwithstanding, the multiblock copolymer gel properties can be attributed to the additional blocks affecting the separate polymer phases, the additional blocks affecting the heterophase structure, the additional blocks affecting the interfacial regions between phases of the multiblock polymers or the additional blocks forming a separate phase or inducing the formation of additional separate phases. Due to the additional number of midblocks of the copolymers (I), the differences in solubility parameters between (A) and (Z) becomes greater than the solubility parameters differences between (A) and (D) of triblock copolymers, where D denotes the lone midblock polymer chain. Moreover, the presence of additional midblocks of ethylene, propylene, butylene, ethylene-propylene, or ethylene-butylene can contribute to stress-induced crystallization. This may explain why as the viscosity of the multiblock copolymers is increased to a higher level, the appearance of the gels change from crystal clear to more translucent white.</p>
    <p num="P-00082">The gels of the present invention resist tearing under tensile loads or dynamic deformation in that when cut or notched, the “crack” made on the gel deep surface does not readily propagate further under dynamic deformation or tensile loads. Unlike triblock copolymer gels, such as (SEBS) and (SEPS) gels which possess high tensile strength and will catastrophically snap apart into two reflective clean smooth surfaces when cut or notched under tensile or dynamic loads. Furthermore, when elongated, the instant gels can exhibit two or more draw plateaus and can possess high tensile strength and rapid return from high extension without noticeable set or deformation. As observed, the gels can be stretched by a first tensile load with uniform deformation to a measured length, upon the application of higher tensile loads, the gel can be further extended without breaking. Upon release, the gel returns immediate to its original shape and any necking quickly disappears. Again, theory notwithstanding, the additional drawing plateaus of the gel can be attributed to yielding of crystallite formations ethylene or propylene components in the gel or yield of induced interfacial regions of concentrated ethylene or propylene between the domains which during extension absorbs the elastic energy. Likewise, the resistance to tear propagation of the instant gels when notched under tensile load can be attributed to yielding of the gel midblock components, yielding of additional phases, or yielding of interfacial regions before rupture or deformation of the (A) domains can take place.</p>
    <p num="P-00083">Additionally, shearing, heating or cooling form the molten state can alter the gels' state. The instant gels can be made to exhibit long elastomeric recovery times. Such gels can be used effectively in suppressing low frequency vibrations and for absorbing energy. The unusual properties of the gels can be attributed to altering different phase or interfacial arrangements of the domains of the multiblock copolymers.</p>
    <p num="P-00084">It should be noted that when the A to Z ratios falls substantially below about 30:70, various properties such as elongation, tensile strength, tear resistance and the like can decrease while retaining other desired properties, such as gel rigidity, flexibility, elastic memory.</p>
    <p num="P-00085">In general, for these block copolymers, the various measured viscosities of 5, 10, 15, and 20, weight percent solution values in toluene at 30° C. can be extrapolated to a selected concentration. For example, a solution viscosity of a 5 weight percent copolymer solution in toluene can be determined by extrapolation of 10, 15, and 20 weight percent measurements to 5 weight percent concentration.</p>
    <p num="P-00086">The Brookfield Viscosities can be measured at various neat polymer concentrations, for example, the selected high viscosity linear multiblock copolymers in (I) can have a typical Brookfield Viscosity value of a 20 weight percent solids solution in toluene at 25° C. of about 1,800 cps and higher, and advantageously about 2,000 cps and higher. Typically, the Brookfield Viscosity values can range from at least about 1,800 to about 16,000 cps and higher. More typically, the Brookfield Viscosity values can range from at least about IWD cps to about 40,000 cps and higher. Still more typically, the Brookfield Viscosity values can range from at least about 1,000 cps to about 80,000 cps and higher. Due to structural variations between the multiblock and star-shaped copolymers, the high viscosity star-shaped or radial copolymers, typically, may exhibit a lower Brookfield Viscosity value than its counterpart linear multiblock copolymers. However, when the multi block copolymers are considered as star-shaped or branched, than at equal branch lengths, the solution viscosities of the multiblock copolymers and branched copolymers are about the same or equivalent.</p>
    <p num="P-00087">In all cases, the molecular chain lengths (molecular weights) of the multiblock and star-shaped (or radial) copolymers (I) must be sufficient to meet the high solution Brookfield Viscosities requirements described herein that is necessary for making the soft, strong and extreme tear resistant gels.</p>
    <p num="P-00088">The copolymers (I) selected have Brookfield Viscosity values ranging from about 1,800 cps to about 80,000 cps and higher when measured at 20 weight percent solution in toluene at 25° C., about 4,000 cps to about 40,000 cps and higher when measured at 25 weight percent solids solution in toluene. Typical examples of Brookfield Viscosity values for star-shaped copolymers at 25 weight percent solids solution in toluene at 25° C. can range from about 3,500 cps to about 30,000 cps and higher; more typically, about 9,000 cps and higher. Other advantageous multiblock and multiblock star-shaped copolymers can exhibit viscosities (as measured with a Brookfield model RVT viscometer at 25° C.) at 10 weight percent solution in toluene of about 400 cps and higher and at 15 weight percent solution in toluene of about 5,600 cps and higher. Other advantageous multiblock and star-shaped copolymers can exhibit about 8,000 to about 20,000 cps at 20 weight percent solids solution in toluene at 25° C. Examples of most advantageous high viscosity linear multiblock copolymers can have Brookfield viscosities at 5 weight percent solution in toluene at 30° C. of from about 40 to about 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 . . . 120, 150, 200 cps and higher, while viscosities of star-shaped multiblock copolymers are 150 cps and higher.</p>

Shell Technical Bulletin SC:1393-92 gives solution viscosity as measured with a Brookfield model RVT viscometer at 25° C. for Kraton G 1654X at 10% weight in toluene of approximately 400 cps and at 15% weight in toluene of approximately 5,600 cps.

When measured at 5 weight percent solution in toluene at 30° C., the solution viscosity of Kraton G 1651 is about 40. Examples of high viscosity SEBS triblock copolymers includes Kuraray's SEBS 8006 which exhibits a solution viscosity at 5 weight percent at 30° C. of about 51 cps. Kuraray's 2006 SEPS polymer exhibits a viscosity at 20 weight percent solution in toluene at 30° C. of about 78,000 cps, at 5 weight percent of about 27 cps, at 10 weight percent of about 1220 cps, and at 20 weight percent 78,000 cps.

    <p num="P-00096">The styrene to ethylene and butylene (S:EB) weight ratios for the Shell designated polymers can have a low range of 20:80 or less. Although the typical ratio values for Kraton G 1651, 4600, and 4609 are approximately about 33:67 and for Kraton G 1855X approximately about 27:73, Kraton G 1654X (a lower molecular weight version of Kraton G 1651 with somewhat lower physical properties such as lower solution and melt viscosity) is approximately about 31:69, these ratios can vary broadly from the typical product specification values. In the case of Kuraray's SEBS polymer 8006 the S:EB weight ratio is about 35:65. In the case of Kuraray's 2005 (SEPS), and 2006 (SEPS), the S:EP weight ratios are 20:80 and 35:65 respectively. Much like S:EB ratios of SEBS and (SEB)<sub>n</sub>, the SEP ratios of very high viscosity SEPS triblock copolymers are about the same and can typically vary as broadly.</p>
    <p num="P-00097">The triblock copolymers (II) such as Kraton G 1654X having ratios of 31:69 or higher can be used and do exhibit about the same physical properties in many respects to Kraton G 1651 while Kraton G 1654X with ratios below 31:69 may also be use, but they are less advantageous due to their decrease in the desirable properties of the final gel.</p>
    <p num="P-00098">Plasticizers particularly advantageous for use in practicing the present invention are will known in the art, they include rubber processing oils such as parffinic and naphthenic petroleum oils, highly refined aromatic-free paraffinic and naphthenic food and technical grade white petroleum mineral oils, and synthetic liquid oligomers of polybutene, polypropene, polyterpene, etc. The synthetic series process oils are high viscosity oligomers which are permanently fluid liquid nonolefins, isoparaffins or paraffins of moderate to high molecular weight.</p>
    <p num="P-00099">Examples of representative commercially available plasticizing oils include Amoco® polybutenes, hydrogenated polybutenes, polybutenes with epoxide functionality at one end of the polybutene polymer, liquid poly(ethylene/butylene), liquid hetero-telechelic polymers of poly(ethylene/butylene/styrene) with epoxidized polyisoprene and poly(ethylene/butylene) with epoxidized polyisoprene: Example of such polybutenes include: L14 (320 Mn), L-50 (420 Mn), L-100(460 Mn), H-15 (560 Mn), H-25 (610 Mn), H-35 (660 Mn), H-50 (750 Mn), H-100 (920 Mn), H-300 (1290 Mn), L-14E (27-37 cst @ 100° F.

    <p num="P-00100">As described at page 23 of copending applications U.S. Ser. No. 09/285,809 and incorporated by reference above, minor amounts of one or more compatible plasticizers can be utilized in forming the invention gels. In providing non-tack gels, major amount of plasticizers used can be low viscosity platicizers having viscosities advantageously of not greater than typically about 30 cSt @ 40° C., for example 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, and the like. Such typical low viscosity plasticizers are commercially available as, for example, Witco, Rudol, Ervol, Benol, Blandol, Carnation, Klearol, Semtol100, Semtol 85, Semtol 70, Semtol 40; Lyondell Duroprime 55, 70, 90, Duroprime DS L &amp; M, Duropac 70, 90, Crystex 22, Crystex AF L &amp; M, Rufflo 6006, 6016 and the like.</p>
    <p num="P-00101">Generally, various low to high viscosity commercially available plasticizing oils with average molecular weights ranging from less than about 200 to greater than about 700 may also be used (e.g. H-300 (1290 Mn)). It is well know that minor and sufficient amounts of Vitamin E is added to the described commercially available oils during bulk processing which is useful as a oil stabilizer, antioxidant, and preservative.</p>
    <p num="P-00102">Of all the factors, the amount and varying viscosities of plasticizing oils can be controlled and adjusted advantageously to obtain various inherent properties, including substantially higher tear and tensile strength gels, and the like. The improvements in tensile strength of the gels are accompanied by responding increase in gel rigidity as the amount of plasticizing oils can be lowered until the rigidity of the gels becomes much higher than that of the rigidity of the gums (for example) which surround the teeth. Although higher tensile strengths can be obtained as the amount of plasticizing oils in the gel approaches zero, the tensile strength of the floss, however, must be maintained at an acceptable gel rigidity (at sufficient high plasticizing oil levels) in order to be as soft as the gums required for flossing. For example, the rigidities of a gel containing 100, 200, or 300 parts by weight of oil is much higher than a gel containing 300, 400, 500, 600, 800, or 900 parts of oil. Selected amounts of one or more low viscosity plasticizers can be use to advantage in forming the gels of the invention having little or no tack.</p>
    <p num="P-00103">These gels can exhibit a larger unit lateral contraction at the same elongation per unit of length as their counterpart parent gels from which the new gels are derived or formed. This property would allow a same unit volume of gel when elongated as its parent to easily wedge between the teeth when flossing. It would seem that a gel having the 1.0 cm<sup>3 </sup>volume made from a ratio of 100 parts by weight of copolymer and 400 pats plasticizer would have a unique macro volume configurations that is at equilibrium with the plasticizer which is much like a 3-D fingerprint which is uniquely different from any other gel of a different copolymer to plasticizer ratio. Reducing the plasticizer content of a ratio 100:400 gel to a 100:300 ratio of copolymer to plasticizer will decrease the amount of plasticizer, but the original macro volume configurations will remain the same.</p>
    <p num="P-00104">Speculative theories not withstanding, configurations may take the form of (1) swiss cheese, (2) sponge, (3) the insides of a loaf of bread, (4) structures liken to ocean brain corals, (5) large structures and small structures forming the 3-D gel volume landscape, (6) the outer heated surface which cools faster than the inner volumes of the gel during its cooling histories may have a patterned crust (rich in A microphases) like that of a loaf of bread and the inner volume may have much like 1-5, and (7) the many different possible structures are unlimited and volume landscapes may be interconnected at the macro-level by threads or microstrands of Z microphases.</p>
    <p num="P-00105">The amount of plasticizer extracted can advantageously range from less than about 10% by weight to about 90% and higher of the total weight of the plasticizer. More advantageously, the extracted amounts of plasticizer can range from less than about 20% by weight to about No by weight of the total plasticizer, and still more advantageously, from about 25% to about 75%. Plasticizing oils contained in the gels can be extracted by any conventional methods, such as solvent extraction, physical extraction, pressure, pressure-heat, heat-solvent, pressure-solvent-heat, vacuum extraction, vacuum-heat extraction, vacuum-pressure extraction, vacuum-heat-pressure extraction, vacuum-solvent extraction, vacuum-heat-solvent-pressure extraction, etc. The solvents selected, should be solvents which do not substantially disrupt the A and Z phases of the (I) copolymers forming the gels . Any solvent which will extract plasticizer from the gel and do not disrupt the A and Z phases can be utilized. Suitable solvents include alcohols, primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols, glycols, etc., examples include methanol, ethanol, tetradecanol, etc. Likewise, the pressures and heat applied to remove the desired amounts of oils should not be sufficient to disrupt the A and Z domains of the (1) copolymers. To form a lower rigidity gel, the simplest method is to subject the gel to heat in a partial vacuum or under higher vacuum for a selected period of time, depending on the amount of plasticizer to be extracted.</p>
    <p num="P-00106">The gels can be made non-adhearing, non-sticking, (non-tacky) by using major or minor amounts of one or more low viscosity plasticizers, by incorporating an advantage amount of stearic acid (octadecanoic acid), metal stearates (e.g., calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, zinc stearate, etc.), polyethylene glycol distearate, polypropylene glycol ester or fatty acid, and polytetramethylene oxide glycol distearate, waxes, stearic acid and waxes, metal stearate and waxes, metal stearate and stearic acid. The use of stearic acid alone do not reduce tack. The amount of stearic acid is also important. As an example, ratio of 200 grams stearic acid to 2,000 gram of SEBS (a ratio of 0.1) will result in spotted tack reduction on the surface of the gel. A ratio of 250 to 2,000 will result in spotted crystallized regions on the surface of the gel or spotted tack reduction. A ratio of 300 to 2,000 will result in complete tack reduction with large stearic acid crystallized regions on the surface of the gel. When microcrystalline waxes are incorporated together with stearic acid, the crystallization of stearic acid completely disappears from the surface of the gel. For example excellent result is achieved with 200 grams of stearic acid, 150 grams of microcrystalline wax and 2,000 grams of SEBS. The same excellent results is achieved when SEBS is adjusted to 3,000 grams, 4,000 grams, etc. The same result is achieved with (I) copolymers as well as in combination with polymers (1I) such as SEPS, (SEB)<sub>n</sub>, (SEP)<sub>n </sub>polymers.</p>
    <p num="P-00107">As described at pages 23-27 of copending applications U.S. application Ser. No. 09/285,809 and pages 20-23 of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/274,498 incorporated by reference above, polyphenolics with one or more sterically hindered phenolic hydroxy groups when incorporated into the invention gels will result in the appearance of large crystals in the interior as well as on the surface of the gels. The crystals have no effect on the high COF of the resulting gels. When selected amounts of internal nucleating agents are incorporated in the invention gels in combination with selected amounts or one or more of a low coefficient of friction (COF) agents, the large crystals no longer forms within the gels; and the surface of the gels exhibit lower and lower COF with time. Bringing the gels in contact with selected external nucleating agents decreases the time or totally eliminates the time needed for the gel's outer surface to exhibit a low COF.</p>
    <p num="P-00108">The gels and soft elastomers incorporating low COF agents and internal and/or external nucleating agents exhibit a much lower coefficient of friction when measured in contact with a reference surface than gels and soft elastomers made without such components.</p>
    <p num="P-00109">School book physics teaches COF can be determined experimentally, for two given surfaces that are dry and not lubricated, the ratio of the tangential force needed to overcome the friction to the normal force which holds the two surfaces in contact (e.g., the weight of a block of gel or elastomer material on a surface) is a constant, independent of the area or of the velocity with which the surfaces (surface of a side of the block in contact with another surface) move over wide limits. This ratio is μ, the coefficient of friction. The coefficient of sliding friction for a block of material being
<br>μ=(f/F<sub>n</sub>)<br>
where f is the force of friction, and F<sub>n </sub>the normal force. For the case of the block on the horizontal table. If m is the mass of the block, then mg is the normal force and the above equation can be written as
<br>μ=f/mg.</p>
    <p num="P-00113">In the case the block of a block rests on a board, originally horizontal, and that the board then is tilted until a limiting angle ø is reached, beyond which the block will begin to slide down the board. At this angle the component of the weight of the object along the board is just equal in amount to that necessary to overcome the force of friction. The force down the plane is mg sin ø, while the normal force is mg cos ø. Therefore we have
<br>μ=(mg sin ø)/(mg cos ø) or μ=tan ø.</p>
    <p num="P-00115">The limiting value of ø for which μ=tan ø is true is call the angle of repose. Measurement of the tangent of this angle will give the coefficient of friction of the contacting surfaces of the block and the board that slide one upon the other. As an example of low COF agents advantageously useful in sofr thermoplastiv elastomers and gels, excellent results is achieved with 50 g rams of a polyphenolic with sterically hindered phenolic hydroxyl groups (Irganox 1010), about 100 of one or more nucleating agents (such as very fine particle size sodium benzoate, dibenzylidene sorbitol, its alkylated derivatives, talc, zinc sterate, amorphous silica, aluminum sterate, etc.) and 5,000 grams of S-EB-S and 25,000 gram of oil. The same excellent result is achieved when S-EB-S is adjusted to 3,000 grams, 4,000 grams, etc. The same result is achieved with copolymers as well as in combination with other polymers. Moreover, when about 50 grams of tetrakis[methylene 3,-(3′5′-di-tertbutyl-4″- hydroxyphenyl) propionatel methane is use (per about 22.68 kilograms of 50 lbs of gel) as a low COF agent, tack is completely removed from the surface of the gel after two to three weeks of blooming.</p>
    <p num="P-00116">When this is repeated with an external nucleating agent, such as with various fine particles for coating the outside surface of the elastomer or gel which fin particles can also be useful for removing tack, such as with talc, calcium stearate, zinc sterate, amorphous silica, aluminum sterate, fine flour, corn starch, fine soil, fine sand, fine metallic powder, vacuum dust, fine wood dusts and the like, lower COF of the gel surface by internal nucleating agents can be achieved within a few days to less than several hours. After coating the gel for the desired period of time, the fine polar and water soluble particles can be washed off with water and soap, while non-polar and non-water soluble fine powders including talc can be removed by wearing it off or by lifting it off with the use of adhesive tapes if so desired.</p>
    <p num="P-00117">What is the surface properties of low CFO agents at the air/plasticizer-copolymer interface? Theory notwithstanding, the resulting gel surface will comprise of very fine molecular segments or even very fine crystal grains of low COF agents confined at the air/plasticizer and polymer interface. Depending on concentration, the non-polar segments of the low COF agents will have a tendency of being adsorpted by the predominate plasticizer and copolymer midblock phase at the gel surface. The slightly polar or more polar segments of the low COF agents are adsorbed to a lesser extent by the plasticizer-copolymer surface. This is supported by observing the water wetting characteristics at the gel surface with and with out low COF agents at the air gel surface interface. A drop of water will bead up and not readily wet the gel surface free of any low COF agents (hydrophobic). The presence of even slightly polar low COF agents exposed on the surface of the gel will make a drop of water flatten out and not bead up when place on the gel surface (hydrophilic).</p>

    <p num="P-00124">This physical elastomeric network structure is reversible, and heating the polymer above the softening point of the glassy domains temporarily disrupt the structure, which can be restored by lowering the temperature. During mixing and heating in the presence of compatible plasticizers, the glassy domains (A) unlock due to both heating and solvation and the molecules are free to move when shear is applied. The disruption and ordering of the glassy domains can be viewed as a unlocking and locking of the elastomeric network structure. At equilibrium, the domain structure or morphology as a function of the (A) and (Z) phases (mesophases) can take the form of spheres, cylinders, lamellae, or bicontinous structures. The scale of separation of the phases are typically of the order of hundreds of angstroms, depending upon molecular weights (i.e. Radii of gyration) of the minority-component segments. The sub-micron glassy domains which provides the physical interlocking are too small to see with the human eye, too small to see using the highest power optical microscope and only adequately enough to see using the electron microscope. At such small domain scales, when the gel is in the molten state while heated and brought into contact to be formed with any substrate and allowed to cool, the glassy domains of the gel become interlocked with the surface of the substrate. At sufficiently high enough temperatures, with or without the aid of other glassy resins (such as polystyrene homopolymers and the like), the glassy domains of the copolymers forming the gels fusses and interlocks with even a visibly smooth substrate surface such as glass. The disruption of the sub-micron domains due to heating above the softening point forces the glassy domains to open up, unlocking the network structure and flow. Upon cooling below the softening point, the glassy polymers reforms together into sub-micron domains, locking into a network structure once again, resisting flow. It is this unlocking and locking of the network structure on the sub-micron scale with the surfaces of various materials which allows the gel to form interlocking composites with other materials.</p>
    <p num="P-00125">A useful analogy is to consider the melting and freezing of a water saturated substrate, for example, foam, cloth, fabric, paper, fibers, plastic, concrete, and the like. When the water is frozen, the ice is to a great extent interlocked with the substrate and upon heating the water is able to flow. Furthermore, the interlocking of the ice with the various substrates on close examination involves interconnecting ice in, around, and about the substrates thereby interlocking the ice with the substrates. A further analogy, but still useful is a plant or weed well established in soil, the fine roots of the plant spreads out and interconnects and forms a physical interlocking of the soil with the plant roots which in many instances is not possible to pull out the plant or weed from the ground without removing the surrounding soil also.</p>
    <p num="P-00126">Likewise, because the glassy domains are typically about 200 Angstroms in diameter, the physical interlocking involve domains small enough to fit into and lock with the smallest surface irregularities, as well as, flow into and flow through the smallest size openings of a porous substrate. Once the gel comes into contacts with the surface irregularities or penetrates the substrate and solidifies, it becomes difficult or impossible to separate it from the substrate because of the physical interlocking. When pulling the gel off a substrate, most often the physically interlocked gel remains on the substrate. Even a surface which may appear perfectly smooth to the eye, it is often not the case. Examination by microscopy, especially electron microscopy, will show serious irregularities. Such irregularities can be the source of physical interlocking with the gel.</p>
    <p num="P-00127">Such interlocking with many different materials produce gel composites having many uses. The high tear resistant soft crystal gels are advantageously suitable for a safer impact deployable air bag cushions, other uses include: toys; games; novelty, or souvenir items; elastomeric lenses, light conducing articles, optical fiber connectors; athletic and sports equipment and articles; medical equipment and articles including derma use and for the examination of or use in normal or natural body orifices, health care articles; artist materials and models, special effects; articles designed for individual personal care, including occupational therapy, psychiatric, orthopedic, podiatric, prosthetic, orthodontic and dental care; apparel or other items for wear by and on individuals including insulating gels of the cold weather wear such as boots, face mask, gloves, full body wear, and the like have as an essential, direct contact with the skin of the body capable of substantially preventing, controlling or selectively facilitating the production of moisture from selected parts of the skin of the body such as the forehead, neck, foot, underarm, etc; cushions, bedding, pillows, paddings and bandages for comfort or to prevent personal injury to persons or animals; housewares and luggage; articles useful in telecommunication, utility, industrial and food processing, and the like as further described herein.</p>
    <p num="P-00128">The selected amount of crystallinity in the midblock should be sufficient to achieve improvements in one or more physical properties including improved damage tolerance, improved crack propagation resistance, improved tear resistance, improved resistance to fatigue of the bulk gel and resistance to catastrophic fatigue failure of crystal gel composites, such as between the surfaces of the crystal gel and substrate or at the interfaces of the interlocking material(s) and crystal gel, which improvements are not found in amorphous gels at corresponding gel rigidities.</p>
    <p num="P-00129">As an example, when fabric interlocked or saturated with amorphous S-EB-S gels (gel composites) are used as gel liners for lower limb or above the knee prosthesis to reduce pain over pressure areas and give relief to the amputee, the commonly used amorphous gels forming the liners can tear or rip apart during marathon racewalk after 50-70 miles. In extended use, the amorphous gels can rip on the bottom of the liner in normal racewalk training of 40-60 miles over a six weeks period. In such demanding applications, the crystal gels are especially advantageous and is found to have greater tear resistance and resistance to fatigue resulting from a large number of deformation cycles than amorphous gels. The crystal gels are also useful for forming various orthotics and prosthetic articles such as for lower extremity prosthesis of the L5664 (lower extremity socket insert, above knee), L5665 (socket insert, multi-durometer, below knee), L5666 (below knee, cuff suspension interface), L5667 (below knee, above knee, socket insert, suction suspension with locking mechanism) type devices as described by the American Orthotic &amp; Prosthetic Association (AOPA) codes. The crystal gels are useful for making AOPA code devices for upper extremity prosthetics. The devices can be cast molded or injection molded in combination with or without fiber or fabric backing or fiber or fabric reinforcement. When such liners are made without fabric backing, various gels can be used to form gel-gel and gel-gel-gel composites and the like with varying gel rigidities for the different gel layer(s).</p>

The invention gel can be used by forming a gel overlap portion on the face cup at its edge conforming to the face and serve to provide comfort and maintain partial air or oxygen pressure when worn on the face during sleep. Although tacky gels can be made from the the invention gels, tacky gels because of its tactile feel are undesirable for such applications as face masks and other prolong skin contact uses.</p>

Moreover, because of their improved tear resistance and resistance to fatigue, the crystal gels exhibit versatility as balloons for medical uses, such as balloon for valvuloplasty of the mitral valve, gastrointestinal balloon dilator, esophageal balloon dilator, dilating balloon catheter use in coronary angiogram and the like. Since the crystal gels are more tear resistant, they are especially useful for making condoms, toy balloons, and surgical and examination gloves. As toy balloons, the crystal gels are safer because it will not rupture or explode when punctured as would latex balloons which often times cause injures or death to children by choking from pieces of latex rubber. The crystal gels are advantageously useful for making gloves, thin gloves for surgery and examination and thicker gloves for vibration damping which prevents damage to blood capillaries in the fingers and hand caused by handling strong shock and vibrating equipment.

In order to obtain sufficient adhesion to glass, ceramics, or certain metals, sufficient temperature is also required (e.g. above 250° F.).

For example the vibration isolators can be use under research microscopes, office equipment, tables, and the like to remove background vibrations. The tear resistance nature of the instant gels are superior in performance to triblock copolymer gels which are much less resistance to crack propagation caused by long term continue dynamic loadings.</p>
    <p num="P-00140">Adhesion to substrates is most desirable when it is necessary to apply the adherent crystal gels to substrates in the absence of heat or on to a low temperature melting point substrate for later peel off after use, such as for sound damping of a adherent crystal gel composite applied to a first surface and later removed for use on a the same or second surface. The low melting substrate materials which can not be exposed to the high heat of the molten adherent crystal gels, such as low melting metals, low melting plastics (polyethylene, PVC, PVE, PVA, and the like) can only be formed by applying the adherent crystal gels to the temperature sensitive substrates. Other low melting plastics include: polyolefins such as polyethylene, polyethylene copolymers, ethylene alpha-olefin resin, ultra low density ethylene-octene-1 copolymers, copolymers of ethylene and hexene, polypropylene, and etc. Other cold applied adherent crystal gels to teflon type polymers: TFE, PTFE, PEA, FEP, etc., polysiloxane as substrates are achieved using the adherent crystal gels of the invention.</p>
    <p num="P-00141">Likewise, adherent crystal gel substrate composites can be both formed by casting hot onto a substrate and then after cooling adhering the opposite side of the adherent crystal gel to a substrate having a low melting point. The adherent crystal gel is most essential when it is not possible to introduce heat in an heat sensitive or explosive environment or in outer space. The use of solid or liquid resins promotes adherent crystal gel adhesion to various substrates both while the adherent crystal gel is applied hot or at room temperature or below or even under water. The adherent crystal gels can be applied without heating to paper, foam, plastic, fabric, metal, concrete, wood, wire screen, refractory material, glass, synthetic resin, synthetic fibers, and the like.</p>
    <p num="P-00142">The adhesion properties of the gels are determined by measuring comparable rolling ball tack distance “D” in cm using a standard diameter “d” in mm stainless steel ball rolling off an inclined of height “H” in cm and determining the average force required to perform 180° C. peel of a heat formed G<sub>1</sub>M<sub>1 </sub>one inch width sample applied at room temperature to a substrate M<sub>2 </sub>to form the composite M<sub>1</sub>G<sub>1</sub>M<sub>2 </sub>The peel at a selected standard rate cross-head separation speed of 25 cm/minute at room temperature is initiated at the G<sub>1</sub>M<sub>2 </sub>interface of the M<sub>1</sub>G<sub>1</sub>M<sub>2 </sub>composite, where the substrate M<sub>2 </sub>can be any of the substrates mentioned and M<sub>1 </sub>preferably a flexible fabric.</p>
    <p num="P-00143">Advantageously, glassy phase associating homopolymers such as polystyrene and aromatic resins having low molecular weights of from about 2,500 to about 90,000 can be blended with the triblock copolymers of the invention in large amounts with or without the addition of plasticizer to provide a copolymer-resin alloy of high impact strengths. More advantageously, when blended with multiblock copolymers and substantially random copolymers the impact, strengths can be even higher. The impact strength of blends of from about 150 to about 1,500 parts by weight glass phase associating polymer and resins to 100 parts by weight of one or more multiblock copolymers can provide impact strength approaching those of soft metals. At the higher loadings, the impact strength approaches that of polycarbonates of about 12 ft-lb/in notch and higher.</p>
    <p num="P-00144">The improvements of the crystal gels of the invention is exceptional, the crystal gels are crystal to the touch and can be quantified using a simple test by taking a freshly cut Crystal gel probe of a selected gel rigidity made from the crystal gels of the invention. The crystal gel probe is a substantially uniform cylindrical shape of length “L” of at least about 3.0 cm formed components (1)-(3) of the crystal gels of the invention in a 16×150 mm test tube. The crystal gel probe so formed has a 16 mm diameter hemispherical tip which (not unlike the shape of a human finger tip) is brought into perpendicular contact about substantially the center of the top cover of a new, un-touched polystyrene reference surface (for example the top cover surface of a sterile polystyrene petri dish) having a diameter of 100 mm and a weight of 7.6 gram resting on its thin circular edge (which minimizes the vacuum or partial pressure effects of one flat surface in contact with another flat surface) on the flat surface of a scale which scale is tared to zero. The probe's hemi-spherical tip is place in contact with the center of the top of the petri dish cover surface and allowed to remain in contact by the weight of the gel probe while held in the upright position and then lifted up. Observation is made regarding the probe's tackiness with respect to the clean reference polystyrene surface. For purpose of the foregoing reference tack test, tackiness level 0 means the polystyrene dish cover is not lifted from the scale by the probe and the scale shows substantially an equal positive weight and negative weight swings before settling again back to zero with the swing indicated in (negative) grams being less than 1.0 gram. A tackiness level of one 1, means a negative swing of greater than 1.0 gram but less than 2.0 gram, tackiness level 2, means a negative swing of greater than 2 gram but less than 3 gram, tackiness level 3, means a negative swing of greater than 3 gram but less than 4 gram, before settling back to the zero tared position or reading. Likewise, when the negative weight swing of the scale is greater than the weight of the dish (i.e., for the example referred above, greater than 7.6 gram), then the scale should correctly read −7.6 gram which indicates the dish has completely been lifted off the surface of the scale. Such an event would demonstrate the tackiness of a gel probe having sufficient tack on the probe surface. The crystal gels of the invention fails to lift off the polystyrene reference from the surface of the scale when subject to the foregoing reference tack test. Advantageously, the crystal gels of the invention can register a tackiness level of less than 5, more advantageously, less than 3, still more advantageously, less than 2, and still more advantageously less than 1. The non-tackiness of the crystal gels of the invention can advantageously range from less than 6 to less than 0.5 grams, typical tack levels are less than 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.5, 2.8, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0 grams and the like. Whereas probes of gels made from amorphous gels such as SEPS, SEBS, S-EP-EB-S, and the like with copolymer styrene to rubber ratio of less than 37:63 and plasticizer of higher than 30 cSt 40° C. are found to lift the polystyrene reference from the surface of the scale. For purposes of indicating tack, the method above can provide gel tack level readings of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 grams. More accurate and sensitive readings can be made using electronic scales of tack levels of less than 1 gram. By this simple method tack levels (of a gel probe on a polystyrene reference surface) can be measure in terms of gram weight displacement of a scale initially tared to zero. For purpose of the present invention the method of using a polystyrene reference surface having a weight of 7.6 grams in contact and being lifted by the tackiness of a cylindrical gel probe having a 16 mm diameter hemi-spherical tip is used to determine the tackiness of the crystal gels of the invention. The level of tack being measured in gram Tack at 23° C.</p>
    <p num="P-00145">The gels are prepared by blending together the components including the various additatives as desired at about 23° C. to about 100° C. forming a paste like mixture and further heating said mixture uniformly to about 150° C. to about 200° C. until a homogeneous molten blend is obtained. Lower and higher temperatures can also be utilized depending on the viscosity of the oils and amounts of multiblock copolymers (I) and polymer (II) used. These components blend easily in the melt and a heated vessel equipped with a stirrer is all that is required. Small batches can be easily blended in a test tube using a glass stirring rod for mixing. While conventional large vessels with pressure and/or vacuum means can be utilized in forming large batches of the instant compositions in amounts of about 40 lbs or less to 10,000 lbs or more. For example, in a large vessel, inert gases can be employed for removing the composition from a closed vessel at the end of mixing and a partial vacuum can be applied to remove any entrapped bubbles. Stirring rates utilized for large batches can range from about less than 10 rpm to about 40 rpm or higher.</p>
    <p num="P-00146">The gels of the invention can also contain gases as an additive, i.e. the gel can be foamed. Foam is herein defined as tightly or loosely packing aggregation of gas bubbles, separated from each other by thin or thick layers of gel. Many types of foamed gels (from ultra high density to ultra low density) can be produced as desired by (i) adding gas to the molten gel during processing, and (ii) producing gas in the molten gel during processing. Gas can be added by whipping a gas into the molten gel before it cools or introduce a gas into the molten gel and then expand or reduce the size of the gas bubbles by reducing the pressure to reduce the bubbles size or applying high pressure to expand the bubbles size. In this regard, inert gases such as Carbon dioxide, Nitrogen, Helium, Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon and Radon are suitable. Air can also be used. Gas can be produced in the molten gel by adding one or more of a “blowing agent” to the. Useful blowing agents include dinitroso compounds, such as dinitroso pentamethylene-tetramine, azodicarbonamide, 4,4′oxybis (benzenesulfonyl)hydrazine, 5-phenyltetrazole, p-toluenesulfonyl semicarbazide, sulfonyl hydrazide, such as benzene sulfonylhydrazide. Water can be used as a “blowing agent” to <sup>1 </sup>produce varying density of foam gels; water used to advantage can be in the form of mist, droplets, steam, and hot or cold water. The density of the foam gels can vary from less than 1.00 kilograms per cubic meter to near the solid gel density. Although the materials forming soft solid gels may be more shear resistant, the same materials when made into a foam become much less shear resistant.</p>

    <p num="P-00151">The instant gels is excellent for cast molding and the molded products have various excellent characteristics which cannot be anticipated form the properties of the raw components. Other conventional methods of forming the composition can be utilized.</p>
    <p num="P-00152">In general, the basis of this invention resides in the fact that one or more of a high viscosity linear multiblock and star-shaped multiblock copolymers (I) or a mixture of two or more of such copolymers having (A) end block to elastomeric block ratio preferably within the contemplated range of styrene to rubber ratios of from about 20:80 to about 40:60 and higher, more preferably from between about 31:69 to about 40:60 and higher when blended in the melt with an appropriate amount of plasticizing oil makes possible the attainment of gels having a desirable combination of physical and mechanical properties, notably high elongation at break of at least 1,600%, ultimate tensile strength of about 8×10<sup>5 </sup>dyne/cm<sup>2 </sup>and higher, low elongation set at break of substantially not greater than about 2%, tear resistance of 5×10<sup>5 </sup>dyne/cm<sup>2 </sup>and higher, substantially about 100% snap back when extended to 1,200% elongation, and a gel rigidity of substantially from about 2 gram to about 1,800 gram Bloom and higher.</p>

    <p num="P-00154">The gel articles molded from the instant compositions have various additional important advantages in that they do not crack, creep, tear, crack, or rupture in flexural, tension, compression, or other deforming conditions of normal use; but rather the molded articles made from the instant composition possess the intrinsic properties of elastic memory enabling the articles to recover and retain its original molded shape after many extreme deformation cycles. In applications where extreme tear resistance, low rigidity, high elongation, good compression set and excellent tensile strength are important, the instant gels would be advantageous.</p>
    <p num="P-00155">The gels of the present invention are useful in low frequency vibration applications, such as viscoelastic layers in constrained-layer damping of mechanical structures and goods, as viscoelastic layers used in laminates for isolation of acoustical and mechanical noise, as ant-vibration elastic support for transporting shock sensitive loads, as vibration isolators for an optical table, as viscoelastic layers used in wrappings, enclosures and linings to control sound, as compositions for use in shock and dielectric encapsulation of optical, electrical, and electronic components. The compositions are also useful as molded shape articles for use in medical and sport health care, such use include therapeutic hand exercising grips, dental floss, crutch cushions, cervical pillows, bed wedge pillows, leg rest, neck cushion, mattress, bed pads, elbow padding, dermal pads, wheelchair cushions, helmet liner, cold and hot packs, exercise weight belts, traction pads and belts, cushions for splints, slings, and braces (for the hand, wrist, finger, forearm, knee, leg, clavicle, shoulder, foot, ankle, neck, back, rib, etc.), and also soles for orthopedic shoes. Other uses include various shaped articles as toys, optical uses (e.g. cladding for cushioning optical fibers from bending stresses) and various optical devices, as lint removers, dental floss, as tips for swabs, as fishing bait, as a high vacuum seal (against atmosphere pressure) which contains a useful amount of a mineral oil-based magnetic fluid particles, etc. Moreover, the casted, extruded, or spun threads, strips, yarns, tapes can be weaved into cloths, fine or coarse fabrics.</p>
    <p num="P-00156">The instant compositions can be formed in any shape; the original shape can be deformed into another shape (to contact a regular or irregular surface) by pressure and upon removal of the applied pressure, the composition in the deformed shape will recover back to its original shape.</p>
    <p num="P-00157">As an example of the versatility of use of the instant gels, a hand exerciser can be made in any shape so long as it is suitable for use as a hand exerciser: a sphere shape, a cube shape, a rectangular shape, etc. Likewise, a wheelchair cushion can be made from the composition in any shape, so long as it meets the needs of the user of the cushion. For example, a cushion can be made by forming the composition into a selected shape matching the contours of the specific body part or body region. The composition can be formed into any desired shaped, size and thickness suitable as a cushion; the shaped composition can be additionally surrounded with film, fabric, foam, or any other desired material or combinations thereof. Moreover, the composition can be casted onto such materials, provided such materials substantially maintain their integrity (shape, appearance, texture, etc.) during the casting process. The same applies for brace cushions for the hand, wrist, finger, forearm, knee, leg, etc.</p>
    <p num="P-00158">Other uses include self closing or self tightening enclosures for splicing electrical and telephone cables and wires. For example, the gels can be preformed into a small diameter tubing within an outer elastic tubing, both the internal gel tubing and external elastic tubing can be axially expanded and fixed in place by a removable continuous spiral retainer. Upon insertion of a spliced pair or bundle of cables or wires, the spiral retainer can be removed, as the retainer is removed, the gel and elastic tubing impinges onto the inserted cables or wires splices, thereby sealing the electrical splices against weather, water, dirt, corrosives and shielding the splice from external abuse. The enclosure is completed without the use of heat or flame as is conventionally performed. In the case of multiblock copolymer (I) ‘treated” gels exhibiting delay recovery or long relaxation times and having extreme tear resistance, a tape of such a gel can be used to wrap the area of a spliced pair or bundle of cable or wire by extending the gel tape and wrapping it around the splice. The delayed recovery of the gel is important in that when the splice is fully wrapped and the gel tape end is let go, it will not quickly unravel itself. This allows time to fix in place an outer elastic shelve around the gel tape wrapped area. Thus, the gel tape will eventually fully recover around the spliced area gradually developing a strong radial recovery force about the spliced area so as to prevent the entry of water, dirt, and other contaminations. Triblock copolymer gels do not have adequate tear strength and have too rapid a recovery to allow time for placement of an outer elastic shelve.</p>
    <p num="P-00159">As the treated gels and gels formed from multiblock copolymers (I) having more and more midblock polymer chains can be expected to exhibit greater delay recovery form extension or longer relaxation times with increasing number of midblocks and increasing midblock lengths, such gels having more than three midblocks forming the copolymers (I) can exhibit extreme tear resistance and excellent tensile strength while at the same time exhibit almost liquid like properties. For example, a fun toy can be made from (S-E-EB-ES), (S-B-EB-EB-S), (S-E-EP-E-EP-S), (S-P-EB-P-EB-S), (S-E-EB-E-EB-E-S), (S-E-EP-E-EP-E-EP-E-S), (S-E-EP-EP)<sub>n</sub>, (S-B-EP-E-EP)<sub>n</sub>, (S-E-EP-FEP-E)<sub>n</sub>, (S-E-EB-E-EB-E-EB-E-EB-S)<sub>n </sub>copolymer gels which are molded into cube shapes when placed on the surface of a incline will collect it self together and flow down the incline as a moving body much like a volume of water moving on a high surface tension surface. This is due to the greater distance between the end block (A) domains. Such liquid like performing gels can be very strong and exhibit extreme tear resistance as exhibited by gels made from (S-E-EP-S) multiblock copolymer gels with shorter (A) distance between domains. Such liquid like gels when shaped into a cube will be deformed by the force of gravity on Earth, but will retain its memory and regain to its molded cube shape when released in outer space or reform into a cube if let loose in a container of liquid of equal density. As a comparison, such a toy formed in the shape of a large cube from a high viscosity triblock copolymer with a plasticizer content of 1:1,600 parts will be flattened by the force of gravity and run down an incline, but is very fragile and will start to tear if attempt is made to pick it up by hand. This is an excellent comparison of the difference of tear resistance difference between triblock copolymer gels and multiblock copolymer gels. A useful application is to use such an elastic liquid gel volume to fill a container or to encapsulate an electrical or electronic component in a container filling every available space, when needed, the shapeless gel volume can be removed by pouring it out of the container whole.</p>
    <p num="P-00160">The most surprising, unexpected, versatile use of the composition is dental flossing. The dental floss can be almost any shape so long as it is suitable for dental flossing. A thick shaped piece of the composition can be stretched into a thin shape and used for flossing. A thinner shaped piece would require less stretching, etc. For purposes of dental flossing, while flossing between two closely adjacent teeth, especially between two adjacent teeth with substantial contact points and more especially between two adjacent teeth with substantial amalgam alloy metal contact points showing no gap between the teeth, it is critical that the gel resist tearing, shearing, and crazing while being stretched to a high degree in such situations. For example, dental gel floss can take the form of a disk where the segments of the circumference of the disk is stretched for flossing between the teeth. Other shaped articles suitable for flossing include threads, strips, yarns, tapes, etc., mentioned above.</p>
    <p num="P-00161">In order for gels to be useful as a dental floss, it must overcome the difficult barriers of high shearing and high tearing under extreme elongation and tension loads. The difficulties that the gels must overcome during flossing can be viewed as follows: during the action of flossing, the gel is stretched from no less than about 200% to about 1,100% or higher, the gel floss is deformed as it is pulled down with tearing action between the contacting surfaces of the teeth, then, the wedge of gel floss is sheared between the inner contacting surfaces of the teeth, and finally, the elongated wedged of gel floss is pulled upwards and out between the surfaces of the teeth. The forces encountered in the act of flossing are: tension, shearing, tearing under extreme tension.</p>
    <p num="P-00162">This invention advances the flossing art by providing strong, soft, and extreme tear resistant gels made from multiblock copolymers which gels are substantially as soft as the gums surrounding the teeth.</p>
    <p num="P-00163">Gel floss formed from the gels has many advantages over conventional dental floss such as regular and extra fine waxed and unwaxed nylon floss, spongy nylon fiber floss, and waxed and unwaxed expanded and unexpended teflon floss. Such conventional floss are not recommended for use by children, since a slip or sudden snap in forcing the floss between the teeth may cause injury to the gums which often times results in bleeding. For sensitive gums and inflamed gums which has become red and puffy, it is difficult to floss at, near, and below the gumline. The soft gel floss with softness substantially matching the softness of the gums are of great advantage for use by children and for flossing teeth surrounded by sensitive and tender gums.</p>
    <p num="P-00164">The shear resistant characteristics of the gels can be indirectly determined by subjecting the gel to the shear forces of a pair of twisting strings and the resulting inward pulling forces of the twisting strings can be directly read off of a spring scale. As a pair of strings are gradually twisted, typical values will range from less than one pound to fifty pounds and greater. As the string is being twisted (simulating increased shearing forces), the measured pulling forces can range from a low value of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 . . . to values of 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 pounds and greater.</p>
    <p num="P-00165">Gel material of low strength can not resist the tremendous shearing action of the twisting strings. The twisting action of the strings can exhibit a first order twist, a second order twist, or higher order twists. A first order twist refers to one or more twists of a pair of strings (i.e. a pair of strings when twisted together forms a small tight binding helix). A second order twist refers to one or more large binding helixes build up by a pair of strings that have been twisted beyond the maximum-number of twist which normally produce small tight binding helixes of the first order kind. Similarly, a third order twist refers to a much larger tightly binding helix build up by the maximum number of second order twists produced by the pair of twisting strings. The third order twist may be manifested by the appearance of a branch of two or more twist of the first order twisting strings.</p>
    <p num="P-00166">The order of twisting will increase (from a one, two, three, and higher order twist) until the rubber band breaks. Likewise, a looped string with one end attached to a spring scale and the other end attached to a fixed anchor can be twisted into a first, second, third, and higher ordered twist state. This method can be utilized to directly measure the force generated for each ordered twist states. The static force generated by twisting a string on a spring scale is a way of determining the shear force generated in the shearing action of forcing the gel floss between two closely contacting teeth when flossing.</p>
    <p num="P-00167">In considering dental flossing criteria, one or more of the following conditions can be regarded as critical factors for dental flossing gels.</p>
    <p num="P-00168">Shear Resistant Criteria</p>
    <p num="P-00169">For the gels to be considered useful for flossing, the gels, critically, can withstand a twisting string shearing force of at least about 5 Kg, more advantageously at least about 8 Kg, and still more advantageously at least about 10 Kg of inward pulling force of a pair of twisting strings measured directly on a spring scale.</p>

The simulated upper front teeth comprises two small stainless steel rollers (⅜″ dia.) facing lengthwise parallel and forced together so as to form a contact length of ½ inches under a spring load of two pounds as measured by a Entran® model ELO-200-4 load cell adjusted by a straight micrometer at room temperature.</p>

    <p num="P-00173">For the gels to be considered useful for flossing, the gels, critically, can advantageously exhibit a tensile strength of at least 5 Kg/cm<sup>2 </sup>(when extended to break as measured at 180° U bend around a 5.0 mm mandrel attached to a spring scale) and more advantageously at least 8 Kg/cm<sup>2</sup>, and still more advantageously of about 10 Kg/cm<sup>2 </sup>and higher. The high and gels useful as dental floss can exhibit tensile strengths at break of at least 20 Kg/cm<sup>2</sup>, more advantageously of at least 40 Kg/cm<sup>2, </sup>and exceptionally more advantageously at least 60 Kg/cm<sup>2</sup>. Typically, the tensile strengths range from about 20 Kg/cm<sup>2 </sup>to about 110 Kg/cm2 and higher, more typically from about 30 Kg/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 80 Kg/cm<sup>2 </sup>and higher, especially more typically from about 40 Kg/cm<sup>2 </sup>to about 90 Kg/cm<sup>2 </sup>and higher, and exceptionally typically from about 50 Kg/cm<sup>2 </sup>to about 100 Kg/cm<sup>2 </sup>and higher.</p>
    <p num="P-00174">Propagating Tear Criteria</p>
    <p num="P-00175">As a minimum, for the Gets to be considered useful for flossing, the gels, critically, can advantageously exhibit a propagating tear force (when propagating a tear as measured at 180° U bend around a 5.0 mm diameter mandrel attached to a spring scale) of at least about 1 Kg/cm, more advantageously at least 2 Kg/cm, and still more advantageously of about 3 Kg/cm and higher. The gels useful as dental floss can exhibit tear strengths of at least 4 Kg/cm and higher, more advantageously of at least 6 Kg/cm and higher, exceptionally more advantageously of at least 8 Kg/cm and higher. Typically, the tear propagation strength can range from about 5 Kg/cm to about 20 Kg/cm and higher, more typically from about less than 5 Kg/cm to about 25 Kg/cm and higher, especially more typically form about less than 6 Kg/cm to about 30 Kg/cm and higher, and exceptionally more typically from about less than 8 Kg/cm to about 35 Kg/cm and higher.</p>
    <p num="P-00176">For the Gels to be considered useful for flossing, the gels, critically, can advantageously exhibit a propagating tension tear force (when a cylindrical sample is notched and a tear is initiated at the notched area and propagated past its maximum cylindrical diameter by length-wise stretching of the cylindrical sample) of at least about 1 Kg/cm, more advantageously at least 2 Kg/cm, and still more advantageously of about 4 Kg/cm and higher. The extreme tear resistant gels typically will exhibit even higher tension tear values.</p>
    <p num="P-00177">Rigidity Criteria</p>
    <p num="P-00178">The rigidities of the extreme tear resistant useful for flossing can advantageously range from about 350 gram to about 1,800 gram Bloom, more advantageously from about 400 gram to about 1,500 gram Bloom, especially more advantageously from about 450 gram to about 1,200 gram Bloom, still more advantageously from about 450 gram to about 1,000 gram Bloom, and less advantageously at values of greater than 1,800 gram Bloom.</p>
    <p num="P-00179">In general, as a minimum, the flossing gels can exhibit several critical properties, including advantageously the ability to:</p>
    <p num="P-00180">(1) withstand a shearing force of at least about 5 Kg under the string twisting test described above,</p>
    <p num="P-00181">(2) perform at least 4 flossing cycles without breaking apart when tested on a set of simulated upper front teeth fully contacting under a uniform spring load of two pound,</p>
    <p num="P-00182">(3) exhibit a tensile strength of at least 5 Kg/cm<sup>2 </sup>and higher,</p>
    <p num="P-00183">(4) exhibit a propagating tear force at 180° U bend tear test of at least about 1 Kg/cm, and</p>
    <p num="P-00184">(5) exhibit a propagating tension tear force (on a notched cylindrical sample) of at least about 1 Kg/cm.</p>
    <p num="P-00185">For use as a dental floss, the gel is made (by extruding, spinning, casting, etc) as a continuous gel strand, the gel strand can be in the shape of a fiber of a selected diameter (from less than about 0.15 to about 5.0 mm and greater) as a continuous tape having a selected width and thickness (less than 0.10 mm thin to about 5.0 mm and thicker) or in any desired shape suitable for flossing. The fiber, tape or a selected shape is then cut to a desired length, rolled up and placed into a dispenser suitable for containing and dispensing a measured use amount of gel floss. The continuous fiber and tape can be partly cut or notched for measured single or multiple use. When the floss is pulled from the dispenser to a point showing the notched or cut mark on the length of gel floss, the lid is pushed down on the gel floss nipping it and allowing the floss to be further pulled and separated at the notched or cut point. Additionally, a suitable floss dispenser containing a measured length of gel floss can be fitted with a cutting edge attached to its lid or on its body and the uncut and un-notched gel floss can be dispensed from the dispensing container and cut at the desired measured use length by pressing close the dispenser cutting edge down on the floss so as to nip and cut the gel or by simply closing the dispenser lid or running the gel along the cutting edge on the dispenser body separating a useful length of gel floss.</p>
    <p num="P-00186">In practice, typically during flossing, a gel strand will under go various deformations, some of these deformations can be measured, including original shape, extended shape under tension, nipping force, and nipped deformation under a measured force and width. Typically, any shaped gel strand can be used for flossing, a square cross-section, a circular cross-section, a rectangular cross-section, round, oval, etc. For example, a 235 mm diameter strand when extended under a force of 2.5 kg can be nipped down to 0.14 mm thickness (along a 3 mm uniform width of its cross-section) by a force of 0.9072 Kg (2.0 pound force), a reduction of 16.78:1; a 1.89 mm diameter strand when extended under a force of 2.5 kg can be nipped down to 0.14 mm thickness by a force of 0.9072 Kg (2.0 pound force), a reduction of 135:1; a 2.75 mm diameter strand when extended under a force of 2.5 kg can be nipped down to 0.19 mm thickness by a force of 0.9072 Kg (2.0 pound force), a reduction of 14.4:1; and a 2.63 mm diameter strand when extended under a force of 25 kg can be nipped down to 0.19 mm thickness by a force of 0.9072 Kg (2.0 pound force), a reduction of 13.8:1. the cross-section of the gel floss can be reduced to any degree by stretching and nipping (from less than about 1% to about 1,600% and higher). Advantageously, a gel having the required strength, tear resistance, gel rigidity, and other characteristics described can be formed into a floss of any selected cross-section and thickness provided the floss is capable of being stretched when flossing under tension without breaking. Typically the stretching or pulling force is from about less than 0.1 Kg to about 3 Kg and higher. The cross-section of the strand of gel floss can be capable of being nipped by a 0.9027 Kg (2 pounds) force applied across a width of 3 mm from its original cross-sectional dimensions to a nipped thickness of about 3.0 mm to about 0.02 mm and lower, more advantageously from about 2.5 mm to about 0.04 mm and lower, still more advantageously from about 2.0 mm to about 0.08 mm and lower; especially advantageously from about 15 mm to about 0.15 mm and lower; especially more advantageously from about 1.2 mm to about 0.20 mm and lower; especially still more advantageously from about 1.0 mm to about 0.25 mm and lower.</p>
    <p num="P-00187">The gels made from higher viscosity copolymers (I) are resistant to breaking when sheared than triblock copolymer gels. This can be demonstrated by forming a very soft gel, for example 100 parts copolymer to 800 parts plasticizing oil. The soft gel is cut into a strip of 25 cm×25 cm cross-section, the gel strip is gripped lengthwise tightly in the left hand about its cross-section and an exposed part of the gel strip being gripped lengthwise around its cross-section tightly by the right hand as close to the left hand as possible without stretching. With the two hands gripping the gel strip's cross-section, the hands are moved in opposite directions to shear apart the gel strip at its cross-section. The shearing action by the gripping hands is done at the fastest speed possible as can be performed by human hands. The shearing action is performed at a fraction of a second, possible at about 0.5 seconds. Using this demonstration, the copolymer (I) gels will not easily break completely apart as would gels formed from triblock copolymers. In some cases, it will take two, three, or more attempts to shear a high viscosity copolymer (I) gel strip this way. Whereas, a lower viscosity triblock copolymer gel strip can be sheared apart on the first try. For gels made from copolymers with viscosities of 5 wt % solution in Toluene, their shear resistance will decrease with decreasing viscosity. For example, the shear strengths as tested by hand shearing described above of gels made from copolymers having viscosities of 150, 120, 110, 105, 95, 90, 89, 85, 70, 60, 58, 48, 42, 40, 35, 28, 27, 25, 21 cps, and the like can be expected to decrease with decreasing viscosity.</p>
    <p num="P-00188">The tensile strengths of multiblock copolymer gels made from higher viscosity copolymers (1) can be slightly lower than or equal to the tensile strengths of gels made from lower solution viscosity triblock copolymers (II).</p>
    <p num="P-00189">Strands of gels comprising higher viscosity multiblock copolymers will perform better than gel strands made from gels of lower viscosity triblock copolymers when used in flossing amalgam molars and more than three times better when used in flossing front teeth.</p>
    <p num="P-00190">Gels, in general, will exhibit higher tensile and greater tear resistance than their parent gels containing higher concentrations of plasticizer.</p>
    <p num="P-00191">As compared to spongy nylon, regular waxed nylon, and extra fine unwaxed nylon when flossing amalgam molars, the performance of multiblock copolymer gels are on the average substantially better.</p>

    <p num="P-00204">The tensile strengths of gels made from higher viscosity copolymers are lower than the tensile strengths of gels made from lower solution viscosity copolymers. This was later found to be due to orientation effects and not considered significant.</p>
    <p num="P-00205">The tear resistance of gels made from higher viscosity copolymers are higher than the tear resistance of gels made from lower solution viscosity copolymers.</p>
    <p num="P-00206">Gel strands made from higher viscosity copolymers perform better than gel strands made of lower viscosity copolymers when used in flossing amalgam molars and more than three times better when used in flossing front teeth.</p>
    <p num="P-00207">As compared to spongy nylon, regular waxed nylon, and extra fine unwaxed nylon when flossing amalgam molars, the performance of gels are on the average substantially better.</p>
    <p num="P-00208">Examples below illustrate other modes of practice contemplated.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE IX</heading> <p num="P-00209">At least 120 pcs of the gel strands of EXAMPLE II containing 600 parts oil is individually weighted and placed in a heated vacuum oven, a partial vacuum is applied and the temperature is regulated between about 80° F. to about 150° F. to extract plasticizer from the gel strands. At various oven and vacuum times, three gel strands are removed from the vacuum oven, allowed to cool to room temperature, weighted to determine the amount of weight loss and tested for tensile and tear strength As the amount of oil contained in the original gel is reduced from 600 parts by weight to less than 200 parts by weight, the “reduced plasticizer volume” gels are weighted and tested. The tear and tensile strengths of the reduced plasticizer volume gels are found to be improved over the properties of the original 600 parts by weight referenced gel strands.</p>
    <p num="P-00210">The gels are especially advantageously useful when subjected to conditions of stretching, shearing, and tearing during flossing. The gels useful for flossing are characterized by low rigidities and high solution viscosity of the gels made from multiblock copolymers having two or more midblock polymer chains.</p>
