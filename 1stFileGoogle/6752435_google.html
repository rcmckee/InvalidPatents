    <heading>STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT</heading> <p>Not applicable.</p>
    <heading>REFERENCE TO MICROFICHE APPENDIX</heading> <p>Not applicable.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention relates to the assembly and installation of precast concrete segments used in construction activities, such as bridge and highway construction. More particularly, the present invention relates to couplers for joining the ends of interior ducts of such precast concrete segments in end-to-end liquid-tight relationship.</p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</heading> <p>Precast segmental bridges are known and commonly used throughout the world as a means to forge roadways through mountainous terrain or across rivers or other barriers. Such bridges are typically constructed in accordance with the following sequence: First, a series of upright piers are formed along the bridge span. Thereafter, cantilevered bridge section are built out of each pier by successively mounting the precast segments to previously completed bridge components and post-tensioning the segments thereto. The cantilevered bridge sections are built out from each pier in a symmetrical fashion so that the piers are not subjected to undue bending loads. When the cantilevered sections are complete, the ends thereof are post-tensioned together to form a continuous bridge deck. Typically, two such bridge spans are constructed to accommodate the two directions of travel. These spans are generally side-by-side, but need not be parallel (horizontally or vertically) nor at the same elevation.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 1-4 illustrate a form of such precast segmental bridge construction in accordance with the teachings of U.S. Pat. No. 5,231,931, isssued on Aug. 3, 1993 to G. Sauvagiot. This form of segmental precast bridge construction is particularly disclosed as used with a rapid transit viaduct system.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 1, a rapid transit viaduct section two includes a central load bearing span or body member <b>4</b> supported by a pair of upright pier members <b>6</b> and <b>8</b>. Extending laterally from opposite lower side portions of the central body <b>4</b> are a pair of lateral platform structures <b>10</b> and <b>12</b>. Each of the platform structures <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> has a pair of rails <b>14</b> mounted thereon for carrying a rapid transit vehicle. In addition, each of the platform sections may be provided with an upright sidewall section <b>16</b> as required for safety, noise pollution and other considerations. One or more sets of rails <b>14</b> are carried by each of the lateral platform structures depending on the requirements of the transit systems.</p>
    <p>The platform structures <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> each include respective upper platform decks and respective lower support struts <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. The lower support struts <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are mounted as close to the bottom of the central load bearing body <b>4</b> as practicable. Deck members <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> are mounted to the central body <b>4</b> at an intermediate portion thereof above the support struts <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. The support struts angle upwardly from their point of attachment with the load bearing body <b>4</b> until they intersect the deck members. As such, the deck members <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> and support struts <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> form a box section providing resistance to torsional loading caused by track curvature and differential train loading. This box section may be considered a closed base. The load bearing body <b>4</b> bisects the closed base and extends vertically upwardly therefrom to provide span-wise bending resistance. Preferably, the entire duct section <b>2</b> is cast as a single reinforced concrete cross-section.</p>
    <p>The platform sections <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> each include lower pier mounts <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. These are mounted respectively to the bottom of the support structures <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. The pier mounts <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are, in turn, supported, respectively, on the piers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b> using a plurality of neoprene pads <b>30</b>, which provide a cushioned support for the structure.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 1, the viaduct section <b>2</b> forms part of a viaduct system supporting rails <b>14</b> for carrying rapid transit vehicles <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>. The viaduct section <b>2</b> may be formed as a precast modular segment. The viaduct section <b>2</b> is then combined with other viaduct sections to form a precast segmental structure. To facilitate such construction, the load bearing body <b>4</b> may be formed with interlock member <b>36</b>, while the lateral platform structures <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> may be each formed with interlock members <b>38</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 2, a viaduct system is formed from a plurality of precast sections <b>2</b> formed as modular segments and combined as a precast segmental structure extending between sequentially positioned piers (not shown). The sections <b>2</b> are placed in longitudinally abutting relationship. To facilitate that construction, the sections are match cast so that the abutting end portions thereof fit one another in an intimate interlocking relationship. Each successive section is therefor cast against a previously cast adjacent section to assure interface continuity.</p>
    <p>The connection between adjacent modular sections is further secured by way of the interlock members <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>. On one end of each section <b>2</b>, the interlock members <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> are formed as external keys. On the opposite end of each section <b>2</b>, the interlock members are formed as an internal slot or notch, corresponding to the key members of the adjacent viaduct system. Match casting assures that corresponding keys and slots, as well as the remaining interface surfaces, properly fit one another.</p>
    <p>As seen in FIG. 2, the sections <b>2</b> are bound together with one or more post-tensioning cables or tendons <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>. The number of cables used will depend on a number of factors such as cable thickness, span length and loading requirements. The tensioning cables are each routed along a predetermined path which varies in vertical or lateral position along the span of the segmental structure.</p>
    <p>FIG. 3 illustrates, diagrammatically, the manner in which the post-tensioning cables <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> extend through the concrete structure of the spans. As can be seen in FIG. 3, the post-tensioning cables are sometimes positioned within the concrete segment themselves, and at other times are positioned externally thereof.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that multiple post-tension cables are often used as extending through ducts within the concrete structure. In FIG. 4, it can be seen that the sections <b>2</b> are formed with appropriate guide ducts <b>50</b> at locations where the post-tensioning cables passed through the structure. The post-tensioning cable identified collectively by reference numeral <b>52</b> in FIG. 4, are routed through the guide ducts <b>50</b>. To facilitate this routing, a continuous flexible conduit <b>54</b> is initially inserted through the guide ducts, and the post-tensioning cables <b>52</b> are thereafter placed in the conduit. The conduit <b>54</b> may advantageously be formed from polyethylene pipe but could also be formed from flexible metallic materials. The post-tensioning cables <b>52</b> are tensioned using conventional post-tensioning apparatus and the interior of the conduit <b>54</b> is cement grouted along the entire length thereof for corrosion protection.</p>
    <p>One form of duct that is commercially available is shown in FIG. <b>5</b>. The corrugated polymeric duct <b>56</b> is of a type presently manufactured by General Technologies, Inc. of Stafford, Tex., licensee of the present inventor. As can be see in FIG. 5, duct <b>56</b> has a plurality of corrugations <b>58</b> extending radially outwardly from the generally tubular body <b>60</b>. The duct <b>56</b> has ends <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> through which post-tensioning cables can emerge. In FIG. 5, it can be seen that there are longitudinal channels <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> extending along the outer surface of the tubular body <b>60</b>. The longitudinal channels <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> allow any grout that is introduced into the interior of the duct <b>56</b> to flow easily and fully through the interior of the duct <b>56</b>. The longitudinal channels <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> also add structural integrity to the length of the duct <b>56</b>. It is important to realize that the duct <b>56</b> can be formed of a suitable length so as to extend fully through one of the segments <b>2</b> as used in a precast segmental structure.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, when such ducts, such as duct <b>56</b>, are used in such precast segmental construction, it is difficult to seal the ends <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> of each duct to the corresponding duct of an adjacent section of the segmental structure. Conventionally, the segments are joined together in end-to-end relationship through the application of an epoxy material to the matching surfaces of the structure. Under such circumstances, it is very common for the epoxy to flow or to become extruded into the opening at the ends <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> of the duct when the segments are connected in end-to-end relationship. In other circumstances, a grout is pumped through the interior passageway of the duct <b>56</b> so as to offer a seal against the intrusion of air and water into the interior of the duct <b>56</b>. The grout is pumped through the interior of the ducts. Unfortunately, if there is an incomplete connection between the duct <b>56</b> and the duct of an adjoining segment of the segmental structure, then the epoxy will leak out into the interface area between the segments and will not flow fully through the entire duct assembly. Once again, an incomplete grouting of the interior of the duct <b>56</b> may occur.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that in such precast concrete segmental construction, the concrete will slightly warp when matched with the adjoining section. Even though match casting is employed, the lack of homogeneity in the concrete mixtures used for the adjoining sections can cause a misalignment between matching sections. A great deal of tolerance must maintained when a coupler is developed so that any warping or distortion in the surfaces of the matching segments can be accommodated.</p>
    <p>The ability to avoid air and liquid intrusion into the interior of the duct <b>56</b> is very important in such multi-strand, precast concrete segmental structures. As can be seen in FIG. 1, since the structure is often used on bridges or elevated structures, the post-tensioning cables can be subject to a great deal of exposure from the elements. For example, if the bridge structure is associated with roads traveled by motor vehicles, then there is often the application of salt onto the highway. This salt, when dissolved in water, can leach through the area between the structure segments into the ducts and deteriorate the post-tensioning cables over time. As the post-tensioning cables become corroded, over time, they can weaken so as to potentially cause the failure of the segmental structure. Past experience with such structures has shown that the primary area of leakage would be through those crack formed between those matched segments. As such, it is particularly important to provide a coupler for use in association with the plastic ducts which will effectively prevent any liquid intrusion from entering the area interior of the ducts and adjacent to the post-tensioning cables.</p>
    <p>It is an object of the present invention to provide a coupler apparatus which allows for the coupling of multi-tendon ducts in precast segmental concrete structures.</p>
    <p>It is another object of the present invention to provide a coupler apparatus which automatically adjusts for any misalignments or warpage in the matching concrete segments.</p>
    <p>It is another object of the present invention to provide a coupler apparatus which assures a seal between the coupler and the connected duct.</p>
    <p>It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a coupler apparatus which is easy to install, easy to use and easy to manufacture.</p>
    <p>It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a coupler apparatus which effectively prevents the intrusion of an epoxy into the interior of the duct during the sealing of one structural segment to another structural segment.</p>
    <p>It is a further object of the present invention to provide a symmetrical duct coupler which facilitates the ability to manufacture and install the components thereof.</p>
    <p>These and other objects of the present invention will become apparent from a reading of the attached specification and appended claims.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>A coupler apparatus for use with precast concrete segments comprising a first duct having an end and an exterior surface, a first coupler member extending over and around the exterior surface of the first duct and having an end opening adjacent to an end of the first duct, a second duct having an end and an exterior surface, a second coupler member extending over and around the exterior surface of the second duct and having an opening adjacent to the end of the second duct, and a gasket received in the end of the first coupler member and in the end of the second coupler member. The gasket serves to prevent liquid from passing between the ends of the coupler members into an interior of either of the first and second ducts. The first duct and the first coupler are embedded in a first concrete segment. The second duct and the second coupler member are embedded in a second concrete segment. The end of the first coupler member faces the end of the second coupler member.</p>
    <p>An external seal is affixed in generally liquid-tight relationship to an opposite end of the first coupler member and is also affixed to the exterior surface of the first duct. This external seal is formed of an annular heat shrink material. This external seal is in compressive contact with the exterior surface of the first coupler member and with the exterior surface of the first duct.</p>
    <p>An internal seal is interposed in generally liquid-tight relationship between an interior surface of the second coupler member and an exterior surface of the second duct. This internal seal is an annular ring of an elastomeric material positioned so as to allow relative movement between the second coupler member and the second duct while maintaining the liquid-tight relationship therebetween.</p>
    <p>The end of the first coupler member has a generally V-shaped groove with an opening facing the second coupler member. Similarly, the second coupler member has a generally V-shaped groove with an opening facing the first coupler member. The gasket is fitted in the V-shaped groove of at least one of the first and second coupler members. The end of the first coupler member is in abutment with an end of the first duct. Similarly, the end of the second coupler member has a surface in abutment with the end of the second duct. The gasket is an elastomeric ring having a cross-sectional thickness greater than a depth of either of the V-shaped grooves of the first and second coupler members.</p>
    <p>In the present invention, the first duct, the second duct, the first coupler member and the second coupler member are each formed of a polymeric material.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Referring to FIG. 6, there is shown at <b>100</b> the precast concrete segmental structure in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. The structure <b>100</b> includes a first concrete segment <b>102</b> and a second concrete segment <b>104</b>. The first concrete segment <b>102</b> has an outer surface <b>106</b> which is joined in surface-to surface contact with the inner surface <b>108</b> of the concrete segment <b>104</b>. The segments <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> are formed by match casting, as described hereinbefore.</p>
    <p>Importantly, a first duct <b>110</b> is embedded in the first concrete structure <b>102</b>. Duct <b>110</b> has a construction similar to that shown in FIG. 5, or similar to other multi-cable ducts. The first duct <b>110</b> has an end <b>112</b> generally adjacent to the exterior surface <b>106</b> of the concrete segment <b>102</b>. Similarly, a second duct <b>114</b> is embedded in the second concrete segment <b>104</b>. The second duct <b>114</b> has a configuration similar to that of duct <b>110</b>. Duct <b>114</b> has an end <b>116</b> generally adjacent to the inner surface <b>108</b> of concrete segment <b>104</b>. Each of the duct <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> are embedded in the respective concrete segments <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> so as to be generally longitudinally aligned. The duct <b>110</b> has an interior passageway which will be axially aligned with the interior passageway of duct <b>114</b>.</p>
    <p>As can be see in FIG. 6, a plurality of tendons <b>118</b> extend longitudinally through the interior passageways of the ducts <b>110</b> and <b>114</b>. In FIG. 6, these tendons <b>118</b> are properly post-tensioned in a conventional manner. A grouting material <b>120</b> is introduced through the interior passageways <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> to further cement and seal the interior of the ducts <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> around the tendons <b>118</b>. The grouting material, in combination with the polymeric material of the ducts <b>110</b> and <b>114</b>, serves to avoid the adverse effects of liquid intrusion into the tendons <b>118</b>. The present invention utilizes a unique coupler apparatus <b>122</b> which further assures the avoidance of liquid intrusion through the space between the exterior surface <b>106</b> of concrete segment <b>102</b> and the inner surface <b>108</b> of concrete segment <b>104</b>. A first coupler member <b>124</b> extends over and around the exterior surface of the first duct <b>110</b>. The first coupler member <b>124</b> has an end <b>126</b> opening at the exterior surface <b>106</b> of concrete segment <b>102</b>. Similarly, the end <b>126</b> of the coupler member <b>124</b> is generally forward of, but adjacent to, the end <b>112</b> of first duct <b>110</b>. A second coupler member <b>128</b> extends over and around the exterior surface of the second duct <b>114</b>. The second coupler member <b>128</b> has an end <b>130</b> opening at the inner surface <b>108</b> of concrete segment <b>104</b>. End <b>130</b> is slightly forward of the end <b>116</b> of the duct <b>114</b>. A gasket <b>132</b> is received in the ends <b>126</b> and <b>130</b> of the respective coupler members <b>124</b> and <b>128</b>. The gasket <b>132</b> is particularly designed to prevent liquid from passing between the ends <b>126</b> and <b>130</b> of the respective coupler members <b>124</b> and <b>128</b> into the interior of the ducts <b>110</b> and <b>114</b>. The coupler members <b>124</b> and <b>128</b> have an identical configuration to each other. This serves to minimize the manufacturing requirements since only a single mold is required for each of the coupler members. Also, installation is easy since unskilled workers can install the first and second coupler members without regard to the configuration of a particular coupler member.</p>
    <p>An external seal <b>134</b> is affixed in generally liquid-tight relationship to an opposite end <b>136</b> of the first coupler member <b>124</b> and is also affixed to an exterior surface of the first duct <b>110</b>. In particular, the external seal <b>134</b> is formed of an elastomeric sleeve or an annular heat shrink material. The external seal <b>134</b> will be in compressive liquid-tight contact with the exterior surface of the first coupler member <b>124</b> and with the exterior surface of the duct <b>110</b>. Prior to embedding the coupler member <b>124</b> into the concrete associated with the concrete segment <b>102</b>, the coupler member <b>124</b> can be affixed in liquid-tight relationship by applying heat to the exterior surface of the external seal <b>134</b>. As a result, the heat-shrink material of the external seal <b>134</b> will tightly engage the surfaces of the coupler member <b>124</b> and also the exterior surfaces of the duct <b>110</b>. As a result, the exterior surface <b>134</b> will prevent liquid intrusion through the opposite end <b>136</b> of the coupler member <b>124</b>.</p>
    <p>An internal seal <b>138</b> in interposed in generally liquid-tight relationship between the interior surface of the second coupler member <b>128</b> and the exterior surface of the second duct <b>114</b>. This internal seal <b>138</b> is a generally-annular ring formed of an elastomeric material. The internal seal <b>138</b> is positioned to allow relative movement between the second coupler member <b>128</b> and the second duct <b>114</b> while maintaining the liquid-tight relationship between the coupler member <b>128</b> and the duct <b>114</b>. The ability to allow relative movement between the coupler member <b>128</b> and the duct <b>114</b> is important because of the “match casting” used for the formation of the second concrete segment <b>104</b>. If there is any warping or inconsistent relationship between the surfaces <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, the second coupler member <b>128</b> will be able to relatively move with respect to the exterior surfaces of the duct <b>114</b> to adjust for such warping or inconsistencies. The second coupler member is also moveable in relation to any expansion or contraction of the concrete segments <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. This can be done without affecting the liquid-tight environment between the coupler member <b>128</b> and the duct <b>114</b>.</p>
    <p>In FIG. 6, it can be seen that the end <b>126</b> of the first coupler member <b>124</b> has a generally V-shaped groove facing the second coupler member <b>128</b>. In particular, it is the opening of this V-shaped groove which faces the second coupler member <b>128</b>. Similarly, the end <b>130</b> is a V-shaped groove which faces the V-shaped groove of the end <b>126</b>. It can be seen that the gasket <b>132</b> is fitted into the V-shaped groove at one of the ends <b>126</b> and <b>130</b> or into both of the ends <b>126</b> and <b>130</b>.</p>
    <p>So as to further assure the avoidance of any liquid intrusion, it can be seen that the end <b>126</b> of the first coupler member <b>124</b> has a surface <b>140</b> which is in abutment with the end <b>112</b> of the first duct <b>110</b>. Similarly, the, second coupler member <b>128</b> has a surface <b>142</b> which is in abutment with the end <b>116</b> of the second duct <b>114</b>. This relationship further assures the accurate placement of the coupler members in end-to-end relationship and further assures the alignment of the ducts <b>110</b> and <b>114</b>.</p>
    <p>As can be seen in FIG. 6, the gasket <b>132</b> is an elastomeric ring having a crosssectional thickness greater than a depth of either of the V-shaped grooves of the respective ends <b>126</b> and <b>130</b> of the coupler members <b>124</b> and <b>128</b>. As a result, the elastomeric ring of the gasket <b>132</b> will effectively “fill” the outer portions of the V-shaped grooves. The configuration of the V-shaped grooves causes the elastomeric material of the gasket <b>132</b> to “extrude” thereinto so as to establish a tight sealing relationship therewith.</p>
    <p>Importantly, the present invention is of relatively low cost. The first duct <b>110</b>, the second duct <b>114</b>, the first coupler member <b>124</b> and the second coupler member <b>128</b> are formed of a polymeric material. Each of these components can be formed in an injection molding process Similarly, the gasket <b>132</b> can be formed of an elastomeric or other resilient material. The material used for the gasket <b>132</b> should be suitably hydrophobic so as to resist any liquid intrusion.</p>
    <p>FIG. 7 is an illustration of the apparatus <b>100</b> of the present invention prior to the installation of the tendons <b>118</b> and the installation of the grout <b>120</b>. In particular, FIG. 7 shows the initial assembly of the components of the present invention.</p>
    <p>In the present invention, the first duct <b>110</b> is suitably mounted against a metal bulkhead having a flat surface corresponding to the formation of the exterior surface <b>106</b> of concrete segment <b>102</b>. A suitable fixture is provided on the metal bulkhead which will extend into the interior <b>160</b> of the first duct <b>110</b>. Prior to the installation of the first duct <b>110</b> onto the bulkhead fixture, the coupler member <b>124</b> is placed over the exterior surface of the first duct <b>110</b>. Similarly, the external seal <b>134</b> is placed over the end <b>162</b> of the coupler member <b>124</b> opposite the end <b>126</b>. A suitable heating device, such as a hot air blower, can be applied to the external seal <b>134</b> so as to heat shrink the seal <b>134</b> upon the exterior surface of the duct <b>110</b> and upon the exterior surface of the first coupler member <b>124</b>. Once the duct <b>110</b>, along with the attached coupler member <b>124</b> is placed upon the bulkhead fixture, the concrete <b>164</b> can then be poured into a suitable mold. After solidifying, the metal bulkhead, and the attached bulkhead fixture are removed from the surface <b>106</b> so as to create a flat surface thereagainst. Upon solidification, the inner surface <b>108</b> of the concrete segment <b>104</b> will be formed by match casting. In other words, the surface <b>106</b> will act as a surface for the formation of surface <b>108</b>. A suitable mandrel or alignment plug can be placed into the interior passageway <b>160</b> of the first duct <b>110</b>. This alignment plug can extend outwardly beyond the surface <b>106</b>. The second coupler member <b>128</b> can then be applied onto the exterior surface of the second duct <b>114</b>. The internal seal <b>138</b> is interposed between the inner surface of the second coupler member <b>128</b> and the exterior surface of the duct <b>114</b>. The second duct <b>114</b> and its associated coupler <b>128</b> can then be placed over the alignment plug extending outwardly of the interior passageway <b>160</b> of the duct <b>110</b> so as to extend into the interior passageway <b>166</b> of the second duct <b>114</b>. Since there is a possibility of slight misalignment during the formation of the second concrete segment <b>104</b>, the second coupler member <b>128</b> is slidable relative to the duct <b>114</b> by virtue of the “rollability” of the internal seal <b>138</b>.</p>
    <p>After the concrete solidifies, the surface <b>108</b> will be separated from surface <b>106</b>. Similarly, the end <b>130</b> of the coupler member <b>128</b> will be separated from the end <b>126</b> of the coupler <b>124</b>. The gasket <b>132</b> can then be installed into the V-shaped groove associated with the end <b>130</b> of the second coupler <b>128</b>. Because of the enlarged cross-sectional area of the annular gasket <b>132</b>, a portion of the gasket <b>132</b> will extend outwardly beyond the end <b>130</b> of the second coupler member <b>128</b>.</p>
    <p>The segment <b>102</b> can then be installed as part of the segmental structure. The segment <b>104</b> is then transported into position so that the surface <b>108</b> will face the surface <b>106</b>. Since it is possible that a misalignment of the surface of the segments can occur, the particular arrangement of the V-shaped grooves and the shape of the gasket <b>132</b> will accommodate any misalignment. When the surface <b>108</b> is brought into proximity against the surface <b>106</b>, the relatively pointed side <b>168</b> of the gasket <b>132</b> will “funnel” into the V-shaped groove <b>170</b> at the end <b>126</b> of the first coupler member <b>124</b>. Particularly, the pointed side <b>168</b> may contact either side <b>172</b> or <b>174</b> of the V-shaped groove <b>170</b>. As the surface <b>108</b> is brought further into proximity with surface <b>106</b>, the gasket <b>132</b> will extrude into the V-shaped groove <b>170</b> so as to establish an effective liquid-tight seal therewith. After assembling and epoxying of the surfaces <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> together, tendons can be extended through the interior passageways <b>160</b> and <b>166</b> of the respective ducts <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> so as to permanently join the segments <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> in post-tensioned relationship.</p>
    <p>Importantly, as can be seen in FIG. 6, the use of the unique configuration of the gasket <b>132</b>, along with V-shaped groove <b>170</b>, will avoid any intrusion of epoxy into the interior passageways <b>160</b> and <b>166</b>. The gasket <b>132</b> will block the extruded epoxy from flowing in an undesired manner into the interior passageways <b>160</b> and <b>166</b>. In a similar manner, the gasket <b>132</b> will also prevent any liquid intrusion from passing into these interior passageways. The compressive relationship between the V-shaped grooves associated with the coupler members <b>124</b> and <b>128</b> establishes a strong sealing bond between the coupler members which will be resistive to the elements over an extended period of time. Subsequent to installation, the grout can be effectively pumped through the interior passageways <b>160</b> and <b>166</b> without any grout accidentally flowing outwardly of the ducts <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> in the area of the space between the segments <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. Secondary liquid intrusion is effectively accomplished through the tight sealing relationship of the external seal <b>134</b> and the sliding sealing of the internal seal <b>138</b>.</p>
    <p>The foregoing disclosure and description of the invention is illustrative and explanatory thereof. Various changes in the details of the illustrated construction may be made within the scope of the appended claims without departing from the true spirit of the invention. The present invention should only be limited by the following claims and their legal equivalents.</p>
