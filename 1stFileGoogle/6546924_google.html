The machine includes a power head having at least two and preferably three coacting wheels for propelling a ball toward a batter to simulate a pitch. Three AC motors and companion motor drives are provided for causing the wheels to rotate at predetermined speeds. The motor drives include dynamic braking circuits to permit rapid deceleration of the wheels. A pair of linear actuators is provided to permit the power head to be moved to predetermined horizontal and vertical positions. A programmable controller is included for individually controlling the rotational speed of each individual wheel, the horizontal position of the power head and the vertical position of the power head. A smart card reader may be employed for programming of the controller and the machine is adapted to be used in conjunction with a video display to simulate the actual pitching of a baseball by a pitcher. The machine is able to interchangeably deliver pitches of different types to different locations at different speeds with less than ten-second intervals between pitches.</div>

    <p>This is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/259,722 filed on Mar. 1, 1999 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,182,649, in the names of Gregory J. Battersby, James Cobb, Charles W. Grimes, Richard D. Schile and Steven Van Geldern for Ball-throwing Machine.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>The present invention relates generally to a ball-throwing machine and, more particularly, to such a machine that is adapted to pitch baseballs and softballs and throw tennis and other balls interchangeably to different locations and at different speeds and with different spins. The invention has particular applicability as a baseball pitching machine that is able to interchangeably deliver a variety of pitches (i.e., fastballs, curveballs, changeups, etc.) at different speeds to different locations without the need for manually readjusting or repositioning the machine between pitches.</p>
    <p>2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p>Pitching machines and ball-throwing machines are well-known in the art and generally fall into four categories: (1) machines that employ a spring actuated arm mechanism to propel the ball; (2) machines that employ at least one rotating wheel or a pair of rotating, coacting wheels to propel the ball; (3) machines that rely on pneumatic pressure to propel the ball; and (4) machines that employ converging and diverging rotatable discs to propel the ball.</p>
    <p>Examples of ball-throwing machines that employ a spring mechanism to propel the ball are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,757,759 which issued on Sep. 11, 1973 to J. G. Haworth for Automatically Varied Oscillation Type Ball Projecting Device and U.S. Pat. No. 4,524,749 which issued on Jun. 25, 1985 to Paul S. Giovagnoli for Spring-Type Ball Pitching Machine. Commercial versions of such a machine have been marketed by Master Pitching Machine of Kansas City, Mo.</p>
    <p>In recent years, the majority of the commercially available ball-throwing or pitching machines employ one or two coacting rotating wheels which are used to propel a ball that is introduced into the nip between the rotating wheels or between a plate and a single rotating wheel. Examples of such machines are described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,724,437 which issued on Apr. 3, 1973 to E. W. Halstead for Ball-throwing Machine; U.S. Pat. No. 3,815,567 which issued on Jun. 11, 1974 to Norman S. Serra for Coacting Wheel Ball Projecting Device; U.S. Pat. No. 4,197,827 which issued to Tommy L. Smith on Apr. 15, 1980 for Coacting Wheel Ball Projecting Device; U.S. Pat. No. 4,423,717 which issued to Edward W. Kahelin on Jan. 3, 1984 for Variable Double Wheel Ball Propelling Machine; U.S. Pat. No. 4,583,514 which issued to Fujio Nozato on Apr. 22, 1986 for a Ball-throwing Machine; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,922,885 which issued to Shigery Iwabuchi et al. on May 8, 1990 for a Pitching Machine. Commercial machines that employ a pair of rotating coacting wheels are marketed by The Jugs Company of Tualatin, Oreg., ATEC of Sparks, Nev., AAI American Athletic, Inc. of Jefferson, Iowa, K-Lin Specialties, Inc. of Huntington Beach, Calif. and OMNI Sports Technologies of Kansas City, Mo.</p>
    <p>Machines that utilize a pair of coacting wheels are able to deliver a variety of different pitches, e.g., fastball, curve ball, screwball, etc. at a variety of different speeds. Changes in the pitch speed or pitch type are accomplished by varying the speed of the individual wheels and the angle of presentation relative to a horizontal and/or vertical plane. The ability of such machines to deliver different pitches is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,288,127 which issued on Nov. 29, 1966 to J. C. Bullock for Baseball Pitching Machine with Ball Curving Device; U.S. Pat. No. 3,604,409 which issued to Ralph W. Doeg on Sep. 14, 1971 for Ball Projecting Machine with Direction Control Mechanism; U.S. Pat. No. 3,724,437 which issued on Apr. 3, 1973 to Earle W. Halstead for Ball-throwing Machine; U.S. Pat. No. 4,323,047 which issued on Apr. 6, 1982 to James K. McIntosh et al. for Automatic Ball Pitching Machine; U.S. Pat. No. 4,372,284 which issued to James A. Shannon et al. on Feb. 8, 1983 for Baseball-Pitching Machine; U.S. Pat. No. 4,655,190 which issued to Clifford V. Harris on Apr. 7, 1987 for Ball Pitching Machine with Selective Adjustment Between Drive and Pressure Wheels.</p>
    <p>While rotating wheel machines are capable of varying the speed of the pitch and the type of the pitch, an inherent problem with such machines, however, is that they require extensive adjustments and realignment of the machine in order to change from one pitch to another or from one location to another. For example, if a coach seeks to change the pitch to be delivered by the machine from a 90 MPH fastball to a 75 MPH curve ball or from a fastball in one position in the strike zone to a fastball in another position, the coach must manually readjust the wheel speeds, reposition the angle of the wheels relative to a vertical and/or horizontal plane, and manually realign the horizontal and vertical position of the machine. It can take as long as five minutes to accomplish these changes before the machine is properly re-positioned to be able to deliver the next pitch. As a result, coaches tend to use these machines to deliver a series of the same pitch to the same location rather than attempting to interchangeably deliver different pitches to different locations as a pitcher would do in an actual game. Accordingly, these machines are of only marginal value in attempting to prepare a batter for game conditions. Such machines frequently give the hitter a false sense of security, e.g., believing that because they can hit the same pitch delivered repeatedly at the same speed to the same location they will succeed in actual game conditions.</p>
    <p>Others have recognized this problem and incorporated devices in such machines to permit adjustment of both the horizontal and vertical position of such machines. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,174,565 which issued on Dec. 29, 1992 to Yutaka Komori for Baseball Pitching Machine; U.S. Pat. No. 5,344,137 which issued on Sep. 6, 1994 to Yutaka Komori for Method for Improving the Accuracy of a Baseball Pitching Machine; U.S. Pat. No. 5,359,986 which issued on Nov. 1, 1994 to Earl K. McGrath et al. for Pitching Machine and Method; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,437,261 which issued on Aug. 1, 1995 to Kerry K. Paulson et al. for Ball Pitching Device. While permitting minor adjustments for both horizontal and vertical position to accommodate for slight changes in pitch speed, none of these patents permit rapid changing of pitch type, i.e., fast ball to curve ball, etc. Such change would only be accomplished by a major re-positioning and re-adjusting the rotational velocity of the two coacting wheels.</p>
    <p>Attempts have been made to use three coacting rotating wheels in a pitching machine to permit the delivery of different types of pitches without the need for repositioning the machine between pitches. U.S. Pat. No. 5,649,523 which issued on Jul. 22, 1997 to Jack C. Scott for Ball-throwing Apparatus and U.S. Pat. No. 4,442,823 which issued to Johnnie E. Floyd on Apr. 17, 1984 for Ball-throwing Machine and System Having Three Individually Controllable Wheel Speeds and Angles describe two such attempts. The machines described in these patents are not commercial, however, due, in large measure, to their failure to precisely control the horizontal and vertical positioning of the machine. Moreover, they both fail to carefully consider and control the forces of the three coacting wheels on the ball in order to consistently deliver a variety of different pitches with the accuracy and precision required.</p>
    <p>Granada Pitching Machines of Central Point, Oreg. recently introduced a three-wheel pitching machine that incorporates limited controls over the individual wheel speeds. The machine, known as the Triton G-2000, fails to provide for horizontal and vertical adjustments of the aiming point and, as such, is incapable of delivering a plurality of different pitches at different speeds and locations on an interchangeable basis.</p>
    <p>The concept of programming a pitching machine to deliver a variety of different pitches has been discussed in prior patents, most notably in U.S. Pat. No. 5,125,653 which issued to Ferenc Kovacs et al. on Jun. 30, 1992 for Computer Controller Ball-throwing Machine and U.S. Pat. No. 5,464,208 which issued on Nov. 7, 1995 to Richard A. Pierce for Programmable Baseball Pitching. Such machines are of the two-wheel type and are incapable of rapid change in order to interchangeably deliver a variety of different pitches. Accordingly, the degree of programming offered by these devices is minimal, at best.</p>
    <p>The marriage of a ball-throwing machine with a video display of a pitcher is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,195,744 which issued on Mar. 23, 1993 to Neil S. Kapp et al. for Baseball Batting Practice Apparatus with Control Means. Such device, however, fails to offer the unique advantages of delivering a variety of different pitches as contemplated by the present invention.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Against the foregoing background, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide a ball-throwing machine that can be used to interchangeably throw a variety of different types of balls including baseballs, softballs, tennis balls and the like with less than ten second intervals between throws.</p>
    <p>It is another object of the present invention to provide such a ball-throwing machine that is able to interchangeably deliver a variety of different pitches to a variety of different locations at a variety of different speeds without the need to manually readjust the machine between pitches.</p>
    <p>It is yet another object of the present invention to provide such a ball-throwing machine that is able to deliver such pitches without the need for manual adjustment of the machine.</p>
    <p>It is another object of the present invention to provide such a ball-throwing machine that allows a user to select the type, speed and location of each pitch or, alternatively, can be programmed to deliver a variety of pitches in a pre-determined or random manner.</p>
    <p>It is still yet another object of the present invention to provide such a ball-throwing machine in which the controls for such machine can be easily reprogrammed to simulate a predetermined or random pitch pattern.</p>
    <p>It is yet another object of the present invention to provide such a ball-throwing machine that can be synchronized to work in conjunction with video display means to permit a batter to visually view a pitcher prior to and during delivery of the pitch.</p>
    <p>To the accomplishments of the foregoing objects and advantages, the present invention, in brief summary, comprises a ball-throwing machine of the type having a power head including at least one and, preferably, three coacting wheels for propelling a ball toward a batter to simulate a pitch. In the preferred embodiment, the speeds of the three wheels are independently controllable so as to control the ball speed, spin rate and spin axis orientation. It will, of course, be appreciated that the machine can also be used to propel softballs, tennis balls, lacrosse balls and other ball-shaped objects.</p>
    <p>The machine includes control means that include means for independently controlling the rotational speed of each wheel, means for independently controlling the alignment of the power head in the horizontal plane, and means for independently controlling the alignment of the power head in the vertical plane so as to permit said machine to interchangeably deliver pitches of differing types to different locations at different speeds. The means for controlling the rotational speed of each wheel further includes means for rapidly accelerating and decelerating the rotational speed of each wheel.</p>
    <p>The control means also receives feedback from the means for independently controlling the rotational speed of each wheel, means for independently controlling the alignment of the power head in the horizontal plane, and means for independently controlling the alignment of the power head in the vertical plane so as to ensure the speeds and alignment have been reached.</p>
    <p>In a preferred embodiment, the machine includes three coacting wheels for propelling the ball and a control system for simultaneously controlling the rotational speed of the wheels in combination with the horizontal and vertical alignment of the power head.</p>
    <p>The ball-throwing machine of the present invention can be used as a stand-alone pitching machine for training baseball, softball, tennis and lacrosse players. In addition, it may be combined with a video display device that visually displays an actual pitcher or tennis player and which synchronizes the release of the ball with the video display so as, for example, to simulate an actual pitcher delivering an actual pitch.</p>

    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p>Referring to the drawings and, in particular, to FIG. 1 thereof, the ball-throwing machine of the present invention is provided and is referred to generally by reference numeral <b>10</b>. The machine <b>10</b> includes an upper portion <b>12</b> that is mounted on a base <b>13</b> that includes a plurality of removable legs <b>14</b>, preferably a front leg <b>14</b>A and a pair of rear legs <b>14</b>B and <b>14</b>C, respectively, to form a tripod. A shock-absorbing device such as a shock absorber (not shown) may be included in the rear legs <b>14</b>B and <b>14</b>C to minimize the impact of any recoil of the machine <b>10</b> during use.</p>
    <p>An enlarged foot <b>15</b> is provided at the outbound end of each leg <b>14</b> and is threadably secured to the leg <b>14</b> by threaded extension fitting <b>16</b> which permits the length of each leg <b>14</b> to be increased and decreased. A flat, rubberized plate <b>17</b> may be included at the bottom of each foot <b>15</b> to provide additional stability for the machine <b>10</b>, particularly when used indoors such as, for example, on a gymnasium floor. Ball-throwing machines experience substantial recoil upon delivery of each pitch and it is important to stabilize the machine and reduce the effect of such recoil in order to provide consistent, accurate, repeatable results.</p>
    <p>As best shown in FIG. 4, the legs <b>14</b> are each attached to the upper portion <b>12</b> by insertion into and engagement with complementary sockets <b>18</b> mounted on the lower surface of the upper portion <b>12</b>. The sockets <b>18</b> are secured to the upper portion <b>12</b> by bolts <b>19</b>. The sockets <b>18</b> for the two rear legs <b>14</b>B and <b>14</b>C are angled relative to the horizontal plane of the upper portion <b>12</b> so that the rear legs <b>14</b>B and <b>14</b>C are positioned at approximately a 30 degree angle relative to the upper portion. This provides a wider base and offers greater stability for the machine <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring again to FIG. 1, the upper portion <b>12</b> includes a moveable power head <b>20</b> having at least two and preferably three coacting drive wheels <b>70</b>A, <b>70</b>B and <b>70</b>C (only <b>70</b>A and <b>70</b>B are shown in FIG. 1) which serve to propel a ball introduced into the machine toward a desired location. It should be appreciated that the use of three coacting wheels permits the ball-throwing machine of the present invention to interchangeably deliver a variety of different pitches without the need for resetting the angle of the power head as is required in other machines such as, for example, the JUGS machine. In such a three wheel design, two wheels serve as the drive wheels while the third wheel serves to impart spin on the ball as it passes in the nip <b>92</b> between the coacting wheels <b>70</b>A-<b>70</b>C.</p>
    <p>The ball-throwing machine <b>10</b> of the present invention may be used to propel baseballs, softballs, tennis balls, lacrosse balls, and the like depending upon the size of the nip <b>92</b> between the coacting wheels <b>70</b>A-<b>70</b>C.</p>
    <p>In a preferred embodiment as illustrated in FIGS. 1-7, the three coacting wheels <b>70</b>A-<b>70</b>C are positioned at equal distances and angles (120 degrees apart) relative to one another. Thus, in the configuration shown in these Figures, the wheels <b>70</b>A-<b>70</b>C are positioned at the 10 o'clock, 2 o'clock and 6 o'clock positions. When so configured, when the user wants to throw a fast ball, the 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock wheels are set at the same speed while the bottom or 6 o'clock wheel is set at a higher speed so as to create backspin on the ball. This results in a rising fastball. Similarly, a changeup can be created by proportionally slowing the speed of the three wheels <b>70</b>A-<b>70</b>C.</p>
    <p>A sinking fast ball or “split finger fastball” can be created by decelerating the speed of the 6 o'clock wheel relative to the drive wheels. This creates a topspin on the ball which causes the pitch to “sink.”</p>
    <p>The ball-throwing machine <b>10</b> is capable of throwing a curve ball by controlling the speed differential of all three drive wheels. By increasing the speed of the 2 o'clock wheel and decreasing the speed of the 10 o'clock wheel relative to the speed of the 6 o'clock wheel, a rotational spin is imparted to the ball which causes it to break in a down and out direction thus simulating an actual curve ball. The amount of break of the pitch can be adjusted by increasing or decreasing the speed differential of the 2 o'clock and 10 o'clock wheels. Similarly, a slider or fast curve ball can be thrown by increasing the speed of all three of the drive wheels.</p>
    <p>A screwball is achieved by decreasing the speed of the 2 o'clock and increasing the speed of the 10 o'clock wheel relative to the speed of the 6 o'clock wheel, causing the ball to rotate and break in a down and in direction.</p>
    <p>A knuckleball can be thrown by setting each wheel at the same speed. This causes the ball to be propelled from the machine <b>10</b> with virtually no spin, thus creating a typical knuckleball. It should be appreciated, however, that the ability to control the delivery location of a knuckleball thrown by the machine is as difficult as the ability to control a knuckleball thrown by a live pitcher.</p>
    <p>The upper portion <b>12</b> of the machine <b>10</b> is pivotally mounted to a base plate <b>30</b> at a center ball joint <b>40</b>. The power head <b>20</b> is comprised of a front plate <b>21</b> and a rear plate <b>22</b>, which are attached to one another by three motor mounts <b>23</b> that extend between the front plate <b>21</b> and the rear plate <b>22</b>. An aperture <b>24</b> is provided in the approximate center of the front plate <b>21</b> of the power head <b>20</b> through which a ball will be propelled from the machine <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>It should be noted that the motor mounts <b>23</b> are secured to the front plate <b>21</b> and the rear plate by a series of bolts <b>34</b> which pass through elongated grooves <b>36</b> in the front plate <b>21</b> and the rear plate <b>22</b>. This permits the actual position of the motor mounts <b>23</b> and the wheels <b>70</b>A-C which are mounted thereof to be adjusted to accommodate different sized balls, e.g.; baseballs, softballs, lacrosse balls, tennis balls, etc. depending upon their position.</p>
    <p>The power head <b>20</b> is further supported by a pair of pivot wheels <b>25</b> that are provided at the opposite sides of the front plate <b>21</b> and which permit the power head <b>20</b> to rotate in a horizontal direction on the base plate <b>30</b>.</p>
    <p>The power head <b>20</b> is adapted to pivot in a horizontal plane about the center ball joint <b>40</b> in order to change the horizontal position of the power head <b>20</b> relative to a center position and, therefore, the angle at which a ball is delivered to a batter. Actual movement of the power head <b>20</b> in a horizontal plane is effected by a horizontal linear actuator <b>50</b> which is provided on the upper surface of the base plate <b>30</b>. Horizontal linear actuator <b>50</b> includes a horizontally extending shaft <b>52</b> which extends from the horizontal linear actuator <b>50</b> to the inside surface of the front plate <b>21</b>. The horizontal linear actuator <b>50</b> serves to cause the power head to pivot in a horizontal direction about the front center ball joint <b>40</b>.</p>
    <p>A spring <b>26</b> holds the power head against the linear actuator <b>50</b> removing backlash from the linear actuator internal mechanism, thereby increasing the accuracy of the horizontal alignment of the power head <b>20</b>. Spring <b>26</b> is secured between a post <b>27</b> that extends upwardly from the base plate <b>30</b> and the inside surface of the front plate <b>21</b>.</p>
    <p>The power head <b>20</b> is further adapted to pivot in the vertical plane about an axis defined by the center ball joint <b>40</b> and the wheels <b>25</b>, in order to change the vertical angle of the power head <b>20</b> relative to the base plate <b>30</b> and, therefore, the vertical angle at which a ball is delivered to a batter. A vertical linear actuator <b>60</b> having a downwardly extending shaft <b>62</b> is provided on the outer surface of the rear plate <b>22</b>. The vertical linear actuator <b>60</b> permits the power head <b>20</b> to pivot in the vertical plane about the front center ball joint <b>40</b>.</p>
    <p>It should be appreciated that the ability to move the power head <b>20</b> in both a horizontal and vertical direction is critical not only to be able to throw pitches to different locations in the strike zone but, more importantly, to permit it to throw breaking pitches as well as pitches of differing speeds. Any ball-throwing machine that is intended to deliver interchangeable pitches of differing types must be able to be repositioned in the horizontal and vertical planes of the power head on a pitch by pitch basis.</p>
    <p>The power head <b>20</b> is thus able to be repositioned in both a vertical and horizontal planes by the use of horizontal and vertical linear actuators. By extending or retracting the shaft <b>522</b> of such actuators <b>50</b> and <b>60</b>, respectively, the power head <b>20</b> is moved in such directions by pivoting about the center ball joint <b>40</b>.</p>
    <p>For example, when one desires to change from a fastball to a changeup (where the speed of the pitch is decreased by at least 10 MPH), the trajectory angle of the pitch must be raised to overcome the effect of gravity on the slower pitch. To accomplish this, the power head <b>20</b> is pivoted about the center pivot <b>40</b> such that the angle of the pitch trajectory is raised to accommodate the effect of gravity on the pitch. This is accomplished by retracting the shaft <b>62</b> of the vertical actuator <b>60</b>, thereby tilting the power head <b>20</b> in an upward direction.</p>
    <p>Similarly, the power head <b>20</b> may be repositioned to throw a curve ball as follows. The shaft <b>62</b> of the vertical linear actuator <b>60</b> is retracted so as to cause the angle of trajectory of the pitch to rise while also changing the horizontal position of the power head <b>20</b> by retracting the shaft <b>52</b> of the horizontal linear actuator <b>50</b> causing the power head to point to the side of the plate away from the break.</p>
    <p>By pivoting the power head <b>20</b> both horizontally and vertically about the center ball joint <b>40</b> located at the front of the machine <b>10</b>, the actual movement of the machine in either or both a horizontal or vertical direction is minimized and, as such, is imperceptible to a batter. Such imperceptibility would be improved if both pivot axes passed through the aperture <b>24</b> in the front plate <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 7 and 8 illustrate the manner in which the power head <b>20</b> rotates about the center ball joint <b>40</b> relative to the base plate <b>30</b> in both a horizontal and vertical direction. As shown in FIG. 7, one can effect rotation of the power head <b>20</b> in a horizontal direction by extension and retraction of the shaft <b>52</b> of the horizontal linear actuator <b>50</b>. Pivot wheels <b>25</b> assist in rotation of the power head <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p>Similarly as shown in FIG. 8, the power head <b>20</b> is able to rotate in a vertical plane about the center ball joint <b>40</b> upon the extension and retraction of the shaft <b>62</b> of the vertical linear actuator <b>60</b>. Obviously, repositioning the power head <b>20</b> will affect the eventual trajectory of the balls being propelled from the machine <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>Control cables (not shown) connect the horizontal and vertical linear actuators <b>50</b> and <b>60</b> to remote actuator controls <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> contained in a remote control box <b>200</b> (see FIGS. 9-10) which can be mounted on the bottom of the base plate <b>30</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 1, the three coacting drive wheels <b>70</b>A, <b>70</b>B and <b>70</b>C of the ball-throwing machine <b>10</b> each include a solid hub <b>72</b>, preferably composed of aluminum, steel or composite material and an outer coating <b>73</b> of a deformable material having a relatively high coefficient of friction so as to permit the wheels <b>70</b>A-<b>70</b>C to sufficiently grip a ball with a minimum of slip in order to propel it toward a batter. Preferred materials for this outer coating include urethane, nitrile rubber and butyl rubber and a preferred hardness for the material is between 25 and 60 Durometer A with a particularly preferred hardness between 40 and 50 Durometer A. While softer materials provide greater conformity to the balls being propelled and allow the machine to be used with a wider variety of balls, such materials have been found to lack the durability required for a commercial product. Moreover, materials having a hardness above 60 Durometer A typically cause a greater slippage of the balls during use which result in decreased machine accuracy.</p>
    <p>While the diameter of the coacting wheels <b>70</b>A-<b>70</b>C can be between eight and 20 inches, a diameter of between 12 and 16 inches is preferred. Wheels having a diameter of approximately 16 inches are particularly preferred. It has been found that larger wheels reduce slippage between the wheels and the balls, thereby increasing the accuracy of the machine. Similarly, larger wheels are advisable when attempting to achieve ultimate ball speeds greater than 90 MPH. Due to the speeds at which these wheels rotate, i.e., up to about 3500 RPM, it is preferable that the hubs be solid and balanced to minimize vibration</p>
    <p>The coacting wheels <b>70</b>A-<b>70</b>C are each powered by drive motors <b>80</b> which are attached to the wheels by motor shafts <b>82</b> which extend through the motor mounts <b>23</b> and are secured to the wheels <b>70</b>A-<b>70</b>C by “Tran torque” expanding bushings <b>84</b>. While drive motors <b>80</b> can be virtually any DC or AC motor with sufficient power to rotate the wheels <b>70</b>A-<b>70</b>C at the desired speeds, one of the essential elements of this machine <b>10</b> is the ability to rapidly accelerate and decelerate the coacting wheels <b>70</b>A-<b>70</b>C to permit the machine to interchangeably deliver a variety of different pitches in a relatively short period of time, i.e., less than 7-10 seconds. There are situations where it is necessary to rapidly accelerate a wheel from, for example, 1200 RPM to 2500 RPM while, simultaneously decelerating another wheel from 2500 RPM to 1500 RPM.</p>
    <p>The ability to rapidly accelerate and decelerate the speed of these wheels <b>70</b>A-<b>70</b>C accurately coming to the new speed is a critical feature of this invention. The DC motors heretofore used by other ball-throwing machines were found to be incapable of achieving the rapid acceleration and deceleration of the coacting wheels required for such a machine. For example, one of the stated objectives of this ball-throwing machine is to be able to deliver different pitches within a 7-10 second time period to simulate actual batting practice conditions with live pitchers. This, of course, requires rapidly accelerating and decelerating certain wheels within this limited period to be able to deliver these different pitches.</p>
    <p>It has been determined that such rapid and accurate acceleration and deceleration of the wheels can be easily achieved by the use of AC motors with companion motor drives including dynamic or regenerative braking circuits. Particularly good results have been achieved using a three phase, AC motor that is capable of providing at least ¾ HP. A particularly preferred AC motor is the 1 HP motor marketed by Baldor as model number VM 3116.</p>
    <p>The drive motors <b>80</b> are each connected to remote variable speed AC motor drives <b>202</b>A-<b>202</b>C in control box <b>200</b> (see FIG. 9) by cables <b>85</b>. It is important that these AC motor drives include a dynamic or regenerative braking circuit to permit rapid deceleration of the coacting wheels <b>70</b>A-<b>70</b>C in order to allow the rapid interchangeability of pitches. A particularly preferred AC motor drive is the AC Tech MC1000 Variable Frequency Drive marketed by AC Technology Corporation of Uxbridge, Mass. which includes a dynamic or regenerative braking circuit to permit rapid deceleration of the motor and wheel.</p>
    <p>Ball introduction tube <b>90</b> shown in FIG. 1 is provided for introducing a ball into the ball-throwing machine <b>10</b> into the nip <b>92</b> formed between the coacting wheels <b>70</b>A-<b>70</b>C. It will be appreciated that the ball-throwing machine <b>10</b> of the present invention may be operated either manually with a coach or other individual hand feeding balls to the machine or, alternatively, the machine <b>10</b> may be used in combination with a conventional automatic remote ball feeder of the type commonly used in conjunction with the JUGS and ATEC machines for automatically introducing balls into the machine <b>10</b> between the coacting wheels <b>70</b>A-<b>70</b>C. It will be appreciated, however, that such automatic ball feeders must be modified to work in conjunction with the ball-throwing machine <b>10</b> of the present invention due to the movement of the power head <b>20</b>. In this regard, it is necessary to provide for a flexible, preferably transparent connection between the ball feeder and the power head <b>20</b> to accommodate the movement of the power head <b>20</b>. In either event, however, a ball is introduced into the nip <b>92</b> between the coacting wheels <b>70</b>A-<b>70</b>C for propulsion through the machine <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>A pointer device <b>100</b>, preferably a laser pointer device, is provided on the base plate <b>30</b>, preferably at the front or batter side thereof. The pointer device <b>100</b> is provided to assist the user in properly aligning the ball-throwing machine <b>10</b> in a manner that will be explained in detail herein.</p>
    <p>A pair of transport wheels <b>110</b> is also provided on opposite sides of the base plate <b>30</b> to facilitate relocation and transportation of the machine <b>10</b>. It will be appreciated that these wheels will permit the user to simply roll the machine onto or off the field before insertion of legs <b>14</b> preparatory to use of the machine <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>Warning lights <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> are provided on the front plate <b>21</b> of the power head <b>20</b>, preferably above the ball delivery aperture <b>24</b> or in any other location where they can be easily seen by the batter. The purpose of these warning lights <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> is to alert the batter to the condition of the machine The upper light <b>112</b> is an ON/OFF indicator. When illuminated as a constant GREEN, it advises the batter that the machine is on and ready to deliver a pitch. There are times when the power head <b>20</b> is moving and is incapable of actually delivering a pitch. In those instances, the light will “Flash” to so alert the batter. Upon reaching a set and ready position, it will become a constant GREEN.</p>
    <p>The bottom light <b>114</b> is intended to advise the batter that a ball has been released and is entering the nip <b>92</b> between the coacting wheels <b>70</b>A-<b>70</b>C and is, therefore, about to be pitched. In a normal condition, it will not be illuminated. This light is intended to alert the batter that a ball will be propelled within a fixed period of time, e.g., 1 second, to permit the batter to set for the subsequent pitch. Thus, when both lights are “GREEN,” the machine is ready and about to deliver a pitch to the batter.</p>
    <p>The ball-throwing machine <b>10</b> of the present invention is controlled by a programmable control unit <b>200</b> that is housed in a separate control box <b>201</b> (see FIG. <b>9</b>). As illustrated in FIG. 1, the control unit <b>200</b> may be secured to the underside of the base plate <b>30</b> or, alternatively, as a separate stand-alone box which is connected to the ball-throwing machine by an umbilical cord (not shown). In either event, however, the control unit <b>200</b> is electrically connected to and provides the controls for the ball-throwing machine <b>10</b> of the present invention.</p>
    <p>As shown in greater detail in FIGS. 9-10, the control unit <b>200</b> includes drive motor controls <b>202</b>A-<b>202</b>C, which are electrically connected to and control their respective drive motors <b>80</b>A-<b>80</b>C. As noted earlier, particularly preferred AC motor drives are the AC Tech MC1000 Variable Frequency Drive marketed by AC Technology Corporation of Uxbridge, Mass. which includes a dynamic braking circuit and resistors to permit rapid deceleration of the motor and coacting wheels <b>70</b>A-<b>70</b>C.</p>
    <p>A vertical actuator control <b>204</b> is provided which is electrically connected to and controls the vertical linear actuator <b>60</b>. Similarly, a horizontal actuator control <b>206</b> is provided which is electrically connected to and controls the horizontal linear actuator <b>50</b>. A programmable controller <b>208</b> is provided to control all of the various operations of the ball-throwing machine. A particularly preferred controller is the MultiPro+ MC controller, manufactured by Control Technology, Inc.</p>
    <p>In addition, control unit <b>200</b> includes a controller power supply <b>210</b>, controller terminal blocks <b>212</b>, a filter fan <b>214</b>, a fuse block <b>216</b> and an inlet filter <b>218</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in greater detail in the schematic of FIG. 10, the controller <b>208</b> is electrically connected to and controls the drive motor controls <b>202</b>A-C and the actuator drives <b>204</b> and <b>206</b>. A remote handheld terminal <b>220</b> is electrically connected to the programmable controller <b>208</b> for use by a coach or user.</p>
    <p>FIG. 11 depicts the layout of the remote handheld terminal <b>220</b> which is intended to be used by the coach or batter to control the ball-throwing machine of the present invention. The terminal includes a display area <b>222</b> where the type of pitch, location and speed are displayed using an LCD display. A series of mode LED's <b>224</b> are provided to indicate the mode in which the ball-throwing machine is to operate, i.e., manual, automatic, set and home. The mode LED's correspond to mode selection keys <b>226</b> which permit the user to select the actual mode of the machine which then result in an illumination of the corresponding mode LED's.</p>
    <p>In the manual mode, the ball-throwing machine <b>10</b> is programmed to deliver a single pitch at a time corresponding to the pitch that is manually selected by the coach. Depression of the “Man” key of the mode selection keys <b>226</b> will cause the machine <b>10</b> to operate in the manual mode.</p>
    <p>In the automatic mode, the ball-throwing machine <b>10</b> is programmed to deliver a series of pitches, e.g., twenty or more, in a predetermined sequence. Depression of the “Auto” key of the mode selection keys <b>226</b> will cause the machine <b>10</b> to operate in the automatic mode.</p>
    <p>In the automatic mode, the user will be queried as to which sequence the user wants, e.g., right-hand pitcher to right-hand batter, left-hand pitcher to right-hand batter, etc., and which particular choice of sequence, e.g., the Kevin Brown series, etc. which would simulate an actual sequence of pitches delivered by a particular pitcher. The user may move from selection to selection using the “Position Adjustment Keys” <b>232</b>.</p>
    <p>The “Home” key <b>225</b> is intended to permit the user to “fine adjust” the vertical delivery of pitches to accommodate a particular batter. For example, it might be desirable to “lower” the over strike zone where the batter is 5′6″ and then raise it for the next batter who is 6′2″. Fine adjustment of the strike zone is accomplished using the Position Adjustment Keys <b>232</b> that have an arrow on their surface.</p>
    <p>The “Shift” key <b>227</b> is the equivalent of the “Enter” key on a computer in that it actually enters the selections made by the user into the controller. The “Shift” key also serves to order the delivery of pitches in a manual mode.</p>
    <p>An “On” key <b>228</b> is provided which serves as the on/off control for the machine <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>The ball-throwing machine <b>10</b> is programmed to operate at predetermined set speeds, i.e., fast, medium and slow, and these are selected by depression of the appropriate “Pitch Speed Key” <b>238</b>. For example, when programmed to operate in the fast mode, all pitches will be based on a 90 MPH fastball. In the medium mode, all pitches will be based on an 80 MPH fastball and in the slow speed, all pitches be based on a 70 MPH fastball. It should be appreciated that these settings are purely arbitrary and can be easily changed. For example, where the ball-throwing machine is intended to be used for a major league team, the three settings, i.e., fast, medium and slow, could be, for example, based on a 95 MPH fastball, a 90 MPH fastball and an 85 MPH fastball, respectively. Similarly, the actual number of pitch speed keys can be increased or decreased depending upon the particular application.</p>
    <p>The actual type of pitch being delivered by the ball-throwing machine <b>10</b> of the present invention is selected by depression of the appropriate “Pitch Type Key” <b>230</b>. The ball-throwing machine <b>10</b> of the present invention is programmed to deliver the following types of pitches: rising fastball, sinker or split-finger fastball, changeup, curveball and slider. Other pitches can be added, if desired.</p>
    <p>Similarly, the location of the pitch in the strike zone can be controlled by depressing the appropriate “Pitch Location Key” <b>236</b> which have baseballs on their surface. The ball-throwing machine <b>10</b> has been preprogrammed to deliver pitches to five locations within the strike zone, i.e., high and outside, high and inside, low and outside, low and inside, and center, all based on a right hand batter. Depression of the appropriate Pitch Location Key <b>236</b> will direct the machine <b>10</b> to deliver the pitch to the appropriate location in the strike zone.</p>
    <p>Obviously, these five locations are arbitrary and can be varied depending upon the particular application For example, a coach might find it desirable to deliver pitches actually outside the strike zone to assist a hitter in learning the strike zone. Similarly, the number of locations within the strike zone can be changed to, for example, nine locations rather than the indicated five.</p>
    <p>A data table is pre-programmed in the programmable controller <b>208</b> which determines the appropriate pre-determined settings for the speed of each of the coacting wheels <b>70</b>A-<b>70</b>C and the positions for the horizontal linear actuator <b>50</b> and vertical linear actuator <b>60</b> for each of the pitches selected and their location. An example of such a data table is included in Table 1, which establishes the respective wheel speed and the actuator settings for a series of pitches based on an 80-MPH fastball.</p>

    <p>With respect to the aforementioned table, the pitch type will designate the type of pitch desired and will correspond to the Pitch Type keys <b>230</b> on the hand held terminal <b>220</b>, e.g., fastball, sinker, curveball, slider, screwball and changeup. Similarly, the location in the chart relates to the pitch location as determined by the Pitch Location key <b>236</b> on the terminal <b>220</b>. Typically, a pitch down the center is designated by numeral <b>1</b> followed by a high and outside pitch “<b>2</b>”, high and inside pitch “<b>3</b>”, low and outside pitch “<b>4</b>” and low and inside pitch “<b>5</b>”.</p>
    <p>The individual wheel speeds for wheels A, B and C correspond to the wheel speeds for each of the individual coacting drive wheels <b>70</b>A-<b>70</b>C. The horizontal setting corresponds to the setting on the horizontal actuator control <b>206</b> and the vertical setting corresponds to the setting on the vertical actuator control <b>204</b>. Each of these settings is derived manually by determining the optimal pitch settings for a particular pitch.</p>
    <p>It will be appreciated that similar tables are constructed with respect to each of the pitch speed settings determined by the pitch speed key <b>238</b> on the hand held terminal <b>220</b>, e.g., the slow series based on a 70 MPH fastball and the fast series based on a 90 MPH fast ball. As previously noted, these can vary according to the specific desired pitch speed.</p>
    <p>As previously noted, the ball-throwing machine of the present invention can operate in an automatic mode in which the programmable controller <b>208</b> instructs the machine <b>10</b> to throw a predetermined sequence of pitches to predetermined locations, typically within a particular speed set. For example, the machine <b>10</b> can be programmed to throw a twenty pitch set in the following order: center fastball; fastball high and in; curve ball down and out; sinker down and in; fast ball high and in; screwball down and in; changeup down and out; fastball down and in; slider high and out; fastball high and out; screwball down and in; curveball down and out; etc. Virtually any combination of pitches can be programmed to establish the particular sequence and it can be created to achieve a right hand pitcher vs. a right hand batter; a right hand pitcher vs. a left hand batter; a left hand pitcher vs. a right hand batter; and a left hand pitcher vs. a left hand batter. Moreover, there are times that it might be necessary to change the particular pitch profile for a particular pitcher, e.g., to increase the break of the sinker for Hideo Nomo, etc. This can be accomplished by modifying the wheel settings in the data table to achieve a different pitch.</p>
    <p>These data tables can be programmed into the controller <b>208</b> using a computer. To facilitate the re-programming of the data table, the programmable controller <b>208</b> can be attached to a remote magnetic strip “smart card” reader. In this manner, a particular pitch sequence can be stored on a smart card which may be read by the smart card reader to immediately re-program the controller <b>208</b> and, thereby, change the automatic pitch sequence. This would permit the user to be able to immediately change sequences to simulate a variety of different pitches. Similarly, the smart card can be used to change the profile of a particular pitch, e.g., a 98-MPH fastball for Roger Clemens rather than the “generic” 90-MPH fastball.</p>
    <p>Thus, it is possible to develop a series of smart cards that could be used to program the machine <b>10</b> to simulate the profile of the actual pitches of a pitcher such as Kevin Brown and the sequence to which he might pitch a particular batter, such as Mike Piazza.</p>
    <p>The ball-throwing machine <b>10</b> of the present invention can also be used in conjunction with a video display device on which a pitcher is actually depicted winding up and delivering a pitch. This, of course, offers the advantage of permitting a batter to time their swing against simulated live pitching. Video display devices have been used in commercial batting cages. One such device is marketed under the mark Power Alley by the MIR Corporation of Atlanta, Ga. Currently, such a device uses a conventional ball-throwing device to propel tennis balls to the hitter with no spin at speeds of less than 60 MPH.</p>
    <p>The marriage of such technologies provides actual pitch simulation of the highest order. A batter would be able to take swings against a video of a particular pitcher throwing a series of pitches of the same speed and profile as that pitcher might actually pitch in a live game. Moreover, it would be possible to establish a pitch sequence to simulate the actual pitch sequence that such a pitcher might use in actual competition.</p>
    <p>Obviously, it would be necessary to synchronize the release of the ball from the pitching machine <b>10</b> with the video display but this can be accomplished by coordinating the release of the ball from a feeder device to the image on the video screen to insure that the ball is being released from the pitching machine at the time the pitcher on the video screen is delivering a pitch.</p>
    <p>Using the smart card reader, the machine <b>10</b> can be programmed to simulate the pitches of the actual pitcher being displayed on the video screen. This would include specific settings for the wheels <b>70</b>A-C and the horizontal and vertical linear actuators <b>50</b> and <b>60</b> so as to properly profile the pitches of the particular pitcher and to insure that they are being delivered in a pre-determined pitch sequence.</p>
    <heading>OPERATION OF MACHINE</heading> <p>The ball-throwing machine <b>10</b> of the present invention may be operated both outdoors on a field and indoors in a gymnasium or batting cage facility. It is positioned on the pitcher's mound or at a distance of approximately 60 feet (or 45 feet for Little League distances) from the batter's box. The ball-throwing machine <b>10</b> must initially be leveled and then properly aligned relative to home plate. In order to assist in the proper alignment of the ball-throwing machine, the laser pointer device <b>100</b> is used to project a laser beam toward home plate against a target (not shown) which is positioned at the center of the intended strike zone. The ball-throwing machine <b>10</b> should be manually positioned such that the laser beam falls in the center of the target. Horizontal adjustment of the ball-throwing machine <b>10</b> is accomplished by simply repositioning the machine <b>10</b> in a horizontal direction while vertical adjustment is accomplished by raising or lowering the front leg <b>14</b>A of the base <b>13</b>.</p>
    <p>When the ball-throwing machine <b>10</b> is properly positioned relative to home plate, it is ready for operation. It should be appreciated that upon startup of the machine <b>10</b>, the control unit <b>200</b> automatically positions the power head <b>20</b> in a center position for a center fast ball at the medium speed. That is the “home” or default position and the power head <b>20</b> will always return to that position on startup.</p>
    <p>If the machine is to be used with particularly short or particularly tall batters, the machine can be adjusted to accommodate a particular strike zone either manually or automatically. Manual adjustment is accomplished by changing the vertical height of the front leg <b>14</b>A by adjusting the extension fitting <b>16</b>. Alternatively, it is possible to “fine tune” the strike zone in a vertical direction using the “home” feature on the handheld terminal <b>220</b> using the up and down arrows of the pitch selection keys <b>232</b>. Upon startup of the machine <b>10</b>, however, any previous “fine tune” adjustment is lost and the power head <b>20</b> of the machine <b>10</b> returns to its normal default position.</p>
    <p>Balls can be introduced into the ball-throwing machine <b>10</b> either manually by a coach or automatically using a conventional ball feeder device (not shown). As previously noted, the machine <b>10</b> is adapted to be used in conjunction with a conventional elongated sleeve feeder device of the type commonly used with commercial pitching machines such as the JUGS and ATEC machines. As the power head <b>20</b> of the present ball-throwing machine <b>10</b> is movable, it is necessary to connect the ball feeder to the ball introduction tube <b>90</b> using a flexible, preferably transparent, connection to allow the batter to actually see the delivery of the ball into the machine <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>Such feeders are electrically wired to the control unit <b>200</b>, which controls the release of balls either manually or automatically at predetermined time intervals. For example, when the machine is in the manual mode, balls will be released upon the depression of the “Shift” key <b>227</b> on the terminal <b>220</b> When put in the automatic mode, balls will be released at predetermined time intervals.</p>
    <p>A ball detection switch is provided on the ball feeder means to detect the release of a ball and to illuminate the lower warning light <b>114</b> to warn the batter.</p>
    <p>Upon proper positioning of the ball-throwing machine <b>10</b> relative to home plate, the machine is turned on by depression of the ON/OFF switch on the terminal <b>220</b>. Upon activation of the ON/OFF switch, the machine immediately goes to a default setting in which the machine is set to pitch a Medium fastball down the center of home plate. In addition, the upper warning light <b>112</b> is illuminated, thereby alerting the user to the fact that the machine <b>10</b> is on and potentially ready to pitch.</p>
    <p>The user then has the option of operating the machine <b>10</b> in either a manual or an automatic mode and this selection is made by depression of the appropriate mode selection key <b>226</b>. In the manual mode, the user is prompted to make three choices: the speed selection, i.e., fast, medium or slow; the pitch type, i.e., fast ball, sinker, curve ball, slider, changeup and screwball; and the pitch location, i.e., one of five locations in the strike zone. The appropriate selection is made by depression of the applicable key on the terminal <b>220</b>. These keys can be depressed in any order and upon depression of the applicable key, the relevant information will be displayed on the display area <b>222</b>.</p>
    <p>Upon entering the applicable information, the user is prompted to hit the “Set” key on the terminal and information is stored in the controller <b>208</b>. This determines the appropriate settings for the particular pitch at the particular location from the stored data table and then sends signals to the drive control motors <b>202</b>A-<b>202</b>C, the horizontal actuator controller <b>206</b> and the vertical actuator controller <b>204</b> providing them with the applicable settings for the particular pitch. Upon receipt of the applicable signal, each of the drive motor controls <b>202</b> set their corresponding drive motors <b>80</b> to the specified speed to accomplish the desired wheel speed and the two actuator controllers <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> set their corresponding actuators to the specified positions to position the power head <b>20</b> in the desired position. The affect of this is to reposition the power head <b>20</b> in the proper position to deliver the specified pitch to the predetermined position with the coacting wheels <b>70</b>A-C rotating at an appropriate speed to deliver the selected pitch.</p>
    <p>The controller waits for the proper feedback from the drive control motors <b>202</b>A-<b>202</b>C, horizontal actuator controller <b>206</b> and vertical actuator controller <b>204</b> to indicate the power head <b>20</b> is in the correct position and the wheels <b>70</b>A-C are spinning at the correct rotational velocity. It typically takes between 3 and 4 seconds and always less than ten seconds for the power head <b>20</b> to move to the predetermined position during which the upper warning light <b>112</b> on the front of the machine 10 is flashing. Upon reaching that position, the upper light <b>112</b> turns green and the machine is ready to accept a ball which can be either released from an automatic feed device by depressing the “Shift” key <b>227</b> on the remote terminal <b>220</b> or, alternatively, by manually feeding a ball into the ball introduction tube <b>90</b>. Upon reaching the nip <b>92</b> between the coacting wheels, the ball will be delivered to the batter by the machine.</p>
    <p>The ball-throwing machine <b>10</b> can also be operated in an automatic mode by the depression of the “Auto” key on the terminal <b>220</b>. Upon the depression of the “Auto” key, the user will be queried as to what sequence is desired. As previously noted, virtually an unlimited number of pitch sequences can be programmed including, for example, sequences based on the throwing arm of the pitcher and whether a batter is left handed or right handed. Actual choices will be made by using the “Position Adjustment Keys” <b>232</b>.</p>
    <p>Upon depression of the “Auto” key and selection of the particular sequence, the hitter then selects the appropriate pitch speed set by depression of the appropriate “Pitch Speed Key” <b>238</b>. At that time, the control unit of the machine <b>10</b> takes over, delivering pitches to the batter in a predetermined sequence of particularly profiled pitches.</p>
    <p>As previously noted, the controller <b>208</b> can be readily reprogrammed by the use of a smart card which is meant to work in conjunction with a smart card reader attached to the controller <b>208</b>. In this manner, one could readily reprogram the machine <b>10</b> to deliver a predetermined sequence of pitches of a particular profile. This would permit the machine <b>10</b> to simulate the actual pitching sequence of a particular pitcher.</p>
    <p>Having thus described the invention with particular reference to the preferred forms thereof, it will be obvious that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
