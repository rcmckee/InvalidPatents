    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>This invention relates to a two-piece electrical connector for connecting a flexible flat cable (FFC) or a flexible printed circuit (FPC) to a connection object such as a printed circuit board (PCB) and, in particular, to such a two-piece connector having metallic shells for electromagnetic shielding which is adaptive for high-speed transmission.</p>
    <p>A two-piece electrical connector of the type described is used in, for example, notebook type computers. Such a two-piece electrical connector comprises a cable connector member mounted on a FPC or FFC (which will collectively be referred to as “FPC”) and a mating connector member mounted on a PCB. The cable connector member is mated with the mating connector member to establish the connection between the FPC and the PCB.</p>
    <p>In the prior art, the FPC generally comprises an insulator sheet or film having two laminated layers in which a plurality of signal conductors are embedded for transferring electric signals. A ground pattern is generally coated on at least one outer surface of the insulator film as an electro-magnetic shielding in order to suppress the electro-magnetic interference generating noise.</p>
    <p>JP-A-9 232039 discloses such a two-piece electrical connector which has metallic shells mounted on the outer surface thereof for protecting the connector from noise. A cable connector member in the known connector is provided with a cable fixture for fixing an end of the FPC to the cable connector member itself for establishing electrical and mechanical connection of the FPC and the cable connector member. The cable fixture is rotatably mounted on a connector housing of the cable connector member. That is, when the cable fixture is positioned at a first position or an open position, the one end of the FPC is loosely insertable in the cable connector member. When the cable fixture is angularly rotated to a second position or a fixing position, the one end of the FPC is pressed onto contact terminal portions in the cable connector member by the cable fixture so that the FPC is mechanically and electrically connected to the cable connector member. The cable connector has a metallic shell covering an outer surface of the connector housing and another metallic shell covering the cable fixture.</p>
    <p>In the known connector, two pieces of different metallic shells are required for the cable connector member and another different metallic shell is required to a mating connector. Thus, metallic shells of three different shapes must be prepared and assembled to the two different connector members. This results in a high cost, complicate assembling operation, and difficulty of management and quality control of parts.</p>
    <p>Further, in the known connector, the cable fixture is rotatably mounted on the connector housing. Therefore, the connector requires an increased mounting space in order to allow the rotation of the cable fixture. This results in difficulty of high density disposition of electric parts including the known connector.</p>
    <p>In order to resolve the problems, a copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/050,775 filed Mar. 30, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,066,000, proposes a two-piece electrical connector where fixing a FPC to a cable connector member is performed by a slider inserted together with one end portion of the FPC into a connector housing. A metallic shell fixedly supports the slider therein and is slidably fitted on the connector housing for providing the electromagnetic shielding. Insertion and removal of the slider for the connector housing are performed by a sliding operation of the metallic shell on the connector housing.</p>
    <p>The connector proposed in the copending application described above will be referred to as a “prior connector”, hereinafter.</p>
    <p>However, both of the known connector and the prior connector still have various problems as described below.</p>
    <p>The mating connector member mating with the cable connector member has a plurality of contacts of a pin type. There is a problem that the pin type contact is easy to bend when the cable connector member is connected thereto or removed therefrom.</p>
    <p>Further, the cable connector member has contacts which have complicated structure. In particular, contacts of the prior connector has a complicated box-shaped structure for receiving the pin type contact. Therefore, it is difficult to establish the impedance matching. The impedance mismatching causes a problem for the high speed transmission.</p>
    <p>Further, some of the contacts in cable connector member are arranged to come into contact with the ground pattern on the main surface of the FPC but has no electrical relation with the ground plate pattern on the back surface of the FPC. As a result, there is a disadvantage that grounding is incomplete.</p>
    <p>Further, since ground ones of contacts of the mating connector member are not connected to the shell, ground condition is not maintained excellent if a ground signal flows through the ground contacts in the socket connector.</p>
    <p>Still further, the cable connector member uses a rotating insulator or a slide insulator, and therefore, the number of the parts increases correspondingly. Further, since the height of the cable connector needs correspondingly an additional height for permitting rotation of the rotating insulator or the fitting of the slide insulator, there is such a disadvantage that the entire height is not reduced.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Accordingly, it is a first object of the present invention to provide a plug connector having only a small change of impedance due to a contact.</p>
    <p>Further, it is a second object of the present invention to provide a plug connector capable of transmitting a ground signal securely and completely when the FPC is connected to a ground pattern.</p>
    <p>Further, it is a third object of the present invention to provide a plug connector having a contact highly resistant to buckling deformation which may occur upon insertion or removal.</p>
    <p>Still further, it is a fourth object of the present invention to provide a plug connector whose height can be reduced and in which the number of the parts can be minimized.</p>
    <p>Still further, it is a fifth object of the present invention to provide a plug connector having a structure which is capable of insertion and ejection by sliding, and of locking tightly after the FPC has been connected to the plug connector, but which is easily removed or unlocked by the use of an ordinary jig or tool, such as a screw driver.</p>
    <p>It is a sixth object of the invention to provide a socket connector highly resistant to buckling or deformation which may occur when the counter connector is inserted or removed.</p>
    <p>It is a seventh object of the invention to provide a socket connector having an excellent ground condition and allowing an accurate and complete grounding.</p>
    <p>It is an eighth object of the invention to provide a socket connector in which impedance matching is easy.</p>
    <p>It is a ninth object of the invention to provide a socket connector in which the counter connector is easy to introduce, an end thereof making contact with the ground plate is difficult to buckle or deform, and a strength thereof is intensified so as to reduce a height of the product.</p>
    <p>It is a tenth object of the invention to provide a socket connector coping with a high speed transmission and having a small size and excellent operability.</p>
    <p>It is an eleventh object of the invention to provide a high speed transmission connector comprising a plug connector and a socket connector having the above described advantages.</p>
    <p>According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a plug connector comprising a connector fitting portion to be connected to a counter connector along a first direction at one end of an insulator, and an FPC fitting portion to be connected to an FPC or FFC similarly along the first direction at the other end of the insulator. In the plug connector, the FPC fitting portion has a plurality of contact groups disposed within the insulator. Each of which consists of a pair of two first plug contacts arranged in a second direction intersecting the first direction and a second plug contact for transmitting a ground signal to between the pair.</p>
    <p>According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a socket connector comprising a first counter connector fitting portion to be connected to a counter connector along a first direction and a substrate connecting portion to be soldered onto a substrate. The counter connector has a counter connector's signal contact and a counter connector's ground contact, provided in a second counter connector fitting portion thereof to be connected to the first counter connector fitting portion. The first counter connector fitting portion contains a first socket contact coming into contact with the counter connector's signal contact and a second socket contact coming into contact with the counter connector's ground contact. The first and the second socket contacts are disposed so as to enclose the second counter connector fitting portion in a direction perpendicular to the first direction such that they oppose each other along a direction perpendicular to the first direction.</p>
    <p>According to still another aspect of the present invention, there is provides a high speed transmission connector comprising a plug connector and a socket connector to be connected to each other along a first direction. The plug connector comprises a socket connector fitting portion provided at an end of the insulator so as to be connected to the socket connector along the first direction and an FPC fitting portion provided at the other end of the insulator so as to be connected to FPC or FPC along the first direction. The socket connector comprises a plug connector fitting portion to be connected to the plug connector along the first direction and a substrate connecting portion to be soldered onto a substrate.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p>Referring to FIGS. 1 to <b>19</b>, a description will be made as regards a two-pair connector according to an embodiment of the present invention. The two-pair connector comprises a cable connector member or a plug connector <b>63</b> (FIG.1) and a mating connector member of a socket connector <b>135</b> (FIG.<b>14</b>).</p>
    <p>The plug connector <b>63</b> has a socket connector fitting portion <b>65</b> and an FPC fitting portion. The socket connector fitting portion <b>65</b> is to be connected to a socket connector serving as a substrate side connector (not shown) along a first direction which is a fitting direction. The FPC fitting portion <b>67</b> is to be fit to the FPC or FFC along the same first direction. Both of the fitting portions are provided on both ends in the fitting direction which is the first direction. Here, for convenience for description, two opposite sides of the plug connector <b>63</b>, that is a side of the FPC fitting portion <b>67</b> and another side of the socket connector fitting portion <b>65</b> , will be called “front side” and “rear side”, respectively, relative to the first direction.</p>
    <p>The plug connector comprises an insulator <b>69</b>, a shall <b>71</b>, a plurality of contacts <b>73</b>, and a ground plate <b>75</b>. The insulator <b>69</b> is made of insulating material. The shell is provided for covering the insulator <b>69</b>. The plurality of contacts are arranged in the width direction which will be referred to as a second direction perpendicular to the first direction and inserted in the insulator <b>69</b>. This plug connector will be hereinafter referred to as “first plug contact”. The ground plate <b>75</b> is inserted into insulator <b>69</b> in a manner so that it will not have contact with any of the first plug contacts. Such a first plug contact <b>73</b> is formed by a leaf spring so that any change of its impedance is relatively small.</p>
    <p>The insulator <b>69</b> has a horizontal substantially Y-shaped section produced by overlapping ends of an upper plate <b>77</b>, (FIG.2) a middle plate <b>79</b> and a lower plate <b>81</b> in a third direction perpendicular to the first and the second directions, that is, in the thickness direction, such that the respective plates are staggered from each other horizontally. A bottom end of the upper plate <b>77</b> has protrusions extending in the first direction and forming an accommodating groove <b>83</b> for accommodating a contact which is one end side of the FPC.</p>
    <p>The shell <b>71</b> is in the form of a box made of conductive material having an opening at its rear end. At the front end, an opening is formed which has a slider portion <b>85</b> composed of a flat plate folded backward. A front end portion of the insulator <b>69</b> is projected into the opening <b>87</b>. An FPC fitting portion <b>67</b> into which the FPC is to be inserted is formed by the slider portion <b>85</b> and a front end portion of the upper plate <b>77</b> of the insulator <b>69</b>.</p>
    <p>Further, on both sides of the slider portion <b>85</b>, stopper pieces <b>89</b> are provided as stopping means which prevents the FPC (not shown) from slipping out as well as guiding an insertion of the FPC. Further, on both sides of the top surface of the shell <b>71</b>, spring pieces <b>91</b> are provided which are formed by incision.</p>
    <p>As best shown in FIG. 2, each of the first plug contacts <b>73</b> has a single sheet simple leaf spring structure having only a small change of impedance. The first plug contact comprises a pressed portion <b>93</b>, an FPC contact portion <b>95</b>, and a contact contacting portion <b>97</b>. The pressed portion <b>93</b> is pressed and supported by the insulator <b>69</b>. The FPC contact portion <b>95</b> extends forward from the pressed portion <b>93</b> so as to project into the FPC fitting portion <b>67</b>, whose end is curved in the form of U shape. The contact contacting portion <b>97</b> extends backward from the pressed portion <b>93</b> along a surface of the insulator <b>69</b>, and is bent downward along a rear end slope of the insulator <b>69</b>.</p>
    <p>A plurality of first plug contacts <b>73</b> is spaced in the width direction. Particularly being conscious of the operation signal, two pieces of the first plug contact <b>73</b> are paired and in this example, seven pairs are provided.</p>
    <p>The contact contacting portion <b>97</b> is inserted in a groove <b>99</b> provided on the top surface of the middle plate <b>79</b> of the rear end of the insulator <b>69</b>. In the connector fitting portion <b>65</b> to be connected to the socket connector, on the back surface of the contact <b>73</b> there is placed a ground plate <b>75</b> nipping the insulator <b>69</b>.</p>
    <p>The contact contacting portion <b>97</b> and the ground plate <b>75</b> are provided as they nip this insulator <b>69</b> and are in the form of a single plate, so that a non-pin connector fitting portion <b>65</b> having no pin is formed at the rear end of the plug connector <b>63</b>.</p>
    <p>As best shown in FIG. 3, the front side of the ground plate <b>75</b> is disposed such that it is nipped between the slider portion-<b>85</b> and insulator <b>69</b> and the rear portion thereof is exposed on the bottom surface of the rear end of the insulator <b>69</b>, so that it extends up to protrusion <b>101</b> projecting downward of the middle plate <b>79</b> of the insulator <b>69</b>. Further, as to the ground plate <b>75</b>, its cut piece formed by incision is erected from a plate surface thereof and bent forward and its front end is bent in the form of U shape like the FPC contacting portion (FIG.2) so as to form a contact type spring contacting portion <b>103</b> (hereafter referred to as “second plug contact”) projecting into the FPC fitting portion <b>69</b>. This second plug contact <b>103</b> of the ground plate <b>75</b> is provided so as to make contact with the ground pattern of the front side pattern of the FPC and disposed between the FPC contacting portions <b>95</b> of the first plug contacts <b>73</b> of each pair.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 4, the spring contacting portions (second plug contact) <b>103</b> to be connected to the ground pattern of the front side pattern of the FPC are disposed at several positions. This spring contacting portion <b>103</b> is disposed between the first plug contacts <b>73</b> of each pair as described previously and the spring contacting portion consisting of the second plug contact <b>103</b> is so constructed as to nip the fitting FPC so that it makes contact with the ground patterns of the front and back sides of the FPC, thereby securely transmitting the ground signal of the FPC Further, since the socket connector fitting portion <b>105</b> to be connected to the socket connector (not shown) is of a single sheet, it is capable of transmitting the ground signal through a wide area. Additionally, an opposite side of the socket connector fitting portion <b>105</b> side becomes a front piece suspending vertically.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIGS. 5 to <b>7</b>, under a released state of the plug connector, by sliding the shell <b>71</b> forward relative to the insulator <b>69</b> on which the first plug contact <b>73</b> and ground plate <b>75</b> are mounted, the plug connector <b>63</b> reaches the released state.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIGS. 8 to <b>10</b>, in the released state shown in FIG. 6, the FPC <b>111</b> is inserted and next the shell <b>71</b> is pushed to the insulator <b>69</b> side. A front end of a bottom portion <b>109</b> of the shell <b>71</b> comes into contact with a projecting step portion <b>117</b> on the bottom of the insulator <b>69</b>, so that the motion of the shell <b>71</b> is blocked, thereby completing the fitting.</p>
    <p>At this time, as best shown in FIG. 9, the surface pattern <b>113</b> of the FPC <b>111</b> comes into contact with the FPC contacting portion <b>95</b> of the first plug contact <b>73</b>. On the other hand, the back surface ground pattern <b>115</b> of the FPC <b>111</b> comes into contact with the slider portion <b>85</b> of the shell <b>71</b>, so that it is electrically connected to the ground plate <b>75</b> through an end portion <b>107</b> of the ground plate <b>75</b> in contact with an inner lower surface of the shell <b>71</b>.</p>
    <p>Further, as best shown in FIG. 10, when the slider portion <b>85</b> of the shell <b>71</b> penetrates under the FPC <b>111</b>, the FPC <b>111</b> is pushed upwardly, so that the spring contacting portion <b>103</b> of the ground plate <b>85</b> comes into contact with the surface pattern <b>113</b> of the FPC <b>111</b>. Further in a similar manner, previously the back surface pattern <b>115</b> of the FPC <b>111</b> comes into contact with the slider portion <b>85</b> of the shell <b>71</b>, so that it is electrically connected to the ground plate <b>75</b>. When the FPC is connected to the shell <b>71</b>, the slider portion <b>85</b> makes electrical contact with the back surface ground pattern <b>115</b> of the back side of the FPC <b>111</b>, so that the ground signal of the FPC <b>111</b> can be transmitted securely.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIGS. 10 and 11, a locking portion <b>119</b> is formed on the shell and serves as a locking means. The locking portion <b>119</b> contains a spring portion <b>121</b>, a rectangular portion <b>123</b>, and a spring deflection stopper portion. The spring portion <b>121</b> is formed near the side portion of the shell <b>71</b>. The rectangular hole portion <b>123</b> is formed in the spring portion <b>121</b>. The spring deflection stopper portion <b>125</b> is formed outside the spring portion <b>121</b> of the shell <b>71</b>. Furthermore, the locking portion <b>119</b> is provided with a protrusion <b>127</b> (FIG.2) on the side surface of the insulator <b>69</b>.</p>
    <p>As best shown in FIG. 12, by inserting the protrusion portion <b>127</b> of the insulator <b>69</b> into the hole portion <b>123</b> of the spring portion <b>121</b> when the FPC is connected, the shell <b>71</b> and insulator <b>69</b> are prevented from moving, that is, locked. If they are once locked, even if the FPC <b>111</b> is pulled relative to the insulator <b>69</b>, it cannot be loosened.</p>
    <p>However, as shown in FIG. 12, by inserting a jig <b>129</b> such as a screwdriver into a gap <b>131</b> formed at the rear on both sides of the plug connector <b>63</b> and moving the spring portion <b>121</b> downwardly and outside, the engagement between the hole portion <b>123</b> of the spring portion <b>121</b> and the protrusion <b>127</b> of the insulator <b>69</b> is released, so that the shell <b>71</b> can slide, thereby making it possible to release the FPC <b>111</b> easily.</p>
    <p>Further, as shown in FIG. 13, a loosening stopper mechanism is constructed, in which loosening stopper portions <b>133</b> projecting in the width direction are formed on the front end at both sides of the FPC <b>111</b>. The stopper pieces <b>89</b> is formed on both sides of the shell <b>71</b>. When the FPC is connected, the stopper pieces <b>89</b> come into contact with the loosening stopper portions <b>133</b>, thereby preventing the FPC <b>111</b> from being loose.</p>
    <p>In the above, although the plug connector of an embodiment of the present invention has been described only with respect to the FPC fitting portion to be connected to the FPC <b>111</b>, it is apparent that this FPC fitting portion can be similarly used also for the FFC.</p>
    <p>As described above, according to the present invention, since the contact is formed of a single leaf spring, it is possible to provide a plug connector in which a change of impedance is small.</p>
    <p>Further, according to the present invention, since a single ground plate is in contact with the ground pattern on one surface of the FPC. On the other surface of the FPC, it is possible to provide a plug connector capable of transmitting the ground signal securely and completely.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, according to the present invention, since the connector fitting portion to be connected to the socket connector has a non-pin structure, it is possible to provide a plug connector highly resistant to buckling which may occur upon fitting or removal.</p>
    <p>Still further, according to the present invention, since the second plug contact of the ground plate which is to be in contact with the front side ground pattern of the FPC is so structured as to nip the FPC by itself, it is possible to provide a plug connector having a high contact reliability.</p>
    <p>In addition, according to the present invention, since the shell has a function of the slider portion to achieve ZIF type fitting and this function is carried out without any other help, the thickness of the product can be reduced and it is possible to provide a plug connector whose number of parts can be minimized.</p>
    <p>Further, according to the present invention, since the shell having a function as the slider portion has every locking function, after the FPC is connected, it cannot be loosened easily and, in addition, by using a jig such as a screwdriver, it is easy to operate the slider to remove the FPC.</p>
    <p>Next, the socket connector of the embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 14-19.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIGS. 14 and 15, a socket connector <b>135</b> has a plug connector fitting portion <b>137</b> which is connected to the aforementioned plug connector <b>21</b> along a first direction, provided at a front end thereof and a substrate connecting portion <b>139</b> to be soldered to a substrate, provided at a rear end thereof.

The folding portion <b>161</b> introduces a socket connector fitting portion of the plug connector which is a counter connector of the socket connector <b>135</b> and intensifies the strength. The cutout portion <b>165</b> of the shell <b>147</b> protects a front end of the contact portion <b>163</b> of the ground plate <b>145</b> which will be described later.</p>
    <p>As evident in FIG. 15, the first socket contact <b>143</b> which is a signal contact has a resilient spring property and a narrow sheet-like configuration corresponding to the impedance matching. The first socket contact <b>143</b> comprises a contact portion <b>167</b> one end of which is accommodated in the plug connector fitting portion and bent in a V-shape so as to make contact with the counter contact, a supporting portion <b>169</b> extending from the contact portion <b>167</b> backward of the connector and fixed to the insulator <b>141</b> such that it is supported thereby, and a soldering terminal portion <b>171</b> which extends from the supporting portion <b>169</b> backward of the socket connector <b>135</b> along the first direction and is bent to extend along a third direction perpendicular to the first and second directions and further is bent in the first direction which is a horizontal direction so as to extend horizontally, providing a means for soldering on a PCB. As described above, the signal contact <b>143</b> has a simple sheet-like structure, thereby making it possible to achieve impedance matching.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 16, the ground plate <b>145</b> is formed by punching and pressing a single conductive material plate, constituted of a link portion <b>173</b> extending along the second direction which is a width direction of the socket connector <b>135</b>, soldering terminal portions <b>175</b> bent from the link portion <b>173</b> and extending backward, fixing portions <b>177</b> which extend upward from the same position as the soldering terminal portion <b>175</b> and is bent forward providing a means for connecting to the insulator, contact base portions <b>179</b> disposed between the soldering terminal portion <b>175</b> and fixing portion <b>177</b> and having a resilient spring property, and pairs of the contact portions <b>163</b> (second plug contact) extending from each of the contact base portions <b>179</b> in parallel.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIGS. 14 and 15, a pair of the first socket contacts <b>143</b> which are signal contacts are disposed in parallel, so that concretely, seven pairs thereof are supported by the insulator <b>141</b>. That is, the first socket contacts <b>143</b> of the socket connector <b>135</b> transmit seven pairs of differential signal.</p>
    <p>In the plug connector fitting portion <b>137</b> of the socket connector <b>135</b>, the contact portion <b>167</b> of the first socket contact <b>143</b> is provided on a side of the top plate and the second socket contact <b>163</b> formed of the contact portion of the ground plate <b>145</b> is provided on the bottom side opposing the contact portion <b>167</b> of the first socket contact <b>143</b> in the third direction. The second socket contact <b>163</b> is accommodated in the cutout portion <b>165</b> of the shell <b>147</b>. When the plug connector is connected, the fitting portion of the plug connector is nipped by the contact portion <b>167</b> of the first socket contact <b>143</b> and the second socket contact <b>163</b> from up and down.</p>
    <p>The soldering terminal portions <b>175</b> of the ground plate <b>145</b> are disposed so as to enclose the soldering terminal portions <b>171</b>, <b>171</b> of the first socket contact <b>143</b> for signaling protruded backward of the socket connector <b>135</b> along the second direction (width direction of the socket connector <b>135</b>). By protruding the soldering terminal portion <b>175</b> from the ground plate <b>145</b> as much as possible, the grounding condition can be improved.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 17, in a ground plate <b>145</b>′ according to a modification, fixing portions <b>177</b>′ are formed on both ends of a link portion <b>173</b>′, soldering terminal portions <b>175</b>′ extend from the top of the link portion <b>173</b>′ and like the ground plate shown in FIG. 16, contact base portions <b>179</b>′ extend from a bottom of the link portion <b>173</b>′ and further, contact portions <b>163</b>′, <b>163</b>′ are formed so as to be continuous with the contact base portion <b>179</b>′.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 18, the plug connector <b>63</b> has a FPC fitting portion <b>83</b> at one end thereof and a socket connector fitting portion <b>65</b> at the other end thereof. Reference numeral <b>111</b> denotes FPC connected and locked to the FPC fitting portion.</p>
    <p>Next, connecting between the socket connector and plug connector according to the embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FIG. <b>19</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 19, in the plug connector fitting portion, the contact portion <b>167</b> of the first socket contact <b>143</b> forming a pair with the other one, which is a signal contact of the socket connector <b>135</b> and the second socket contact <b>163</b> which is a contact portion of the ground plate <b>145</b> of the socket connector <b>135</b> are disposed along the third direction so as to oppose each other.</p>
    <p>When the socket connector fitting portion of the plug connector <b>63</b> and the plug connector fitting portion of the socket connector <b>135</b> are connected to each other, the plug connector <b>63</b> is nipped between the contact portion <b>167</b> of the first socket contact <b>143</b> and second contact portion <b>163</b> disposed along the third direction so as to oppose each other in the plug connector fitting portion.</p>
    <p>At this time, the contact portion <b>95</b> of the first plug contact which is a signal contact of the plug connector <b>63</b> comes into contact with the contact portion <b>167</b> of the first socket contact which is a signal contact of the socket connector <b>135</b>.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, the ground contact portion <b>105</b> of the ground plate <b>75</b> of the plug connector <b>63</b> comes into contact with the contact portion <b>163</b> of the ground plate <b>145</b> of the socket connector <b>135</b>. Further, a back side of the contact proximal end of the ground plate <b>145</b> of the socket connector <b>135</b> comes into contact with the lower bottom portion <b>181</b> of the shell <b>147</b>.</p>
    <p>As described, in the socket connector <b>135</b> according to the embodiment of the present invention, the contact portion <b>35</b> <i>c </i>of the signal contact <b>143</b> and contact portion <b>163</b> of the ground plate <b>145</b> are located up and down in the plug connector fitting portion, thereby forming a non-pin type socket connector which is highly resistant to buckling or deformation which may occur when the plug connector <b>63</b> is inserted or removed.</p>
    <p>Further, the ground plate <b>145</b> has a plurality of the contact portions as a ground fitting contact portion and the plurality of the soldering terminal portions <b>175</b> (FIG.16) are formed on a single plate as a single part, ground condition is excellent and grounding is accurate and complete. Further, the contact portions <b>163</b> of the ground plate <b>145</b> are in contact with the shell <b>147</b> through plural points, excellent ground condition can be further maintained.</p>
    <p>Because the signal contact <b>143</b> of the socket connector <b>135</b> according to the embodiment of the present invention is of a simple sheet-like configuration, impedance matching is easy. Because the bottom portion of the side to which the plug connector <b>63</b> is to be connected to the shell <b>147</b> has the folding portion <b>161</b>, (FIG.15) it can introduce the counter connector easily. Further because the cutout portion <b>165</b> is provided on the bottom, it is possible to prevent the contacting end of the plug connector from being buckled or deformed by the ground plate <b>145</b>. Further, the folding portion <b>161</b> of the shell <b>147</b> intensifies the strength and eliminates the necessity of the insulator <b>141</b> at this portion, thereby making it possible to reduce the height of this product.</p>
    <p>Because according to this invention, there is provided a non-pin type socket connector in which the signal contact and ground plate fitting contact portion are located up and down, a socket connector highly resistant to buckling or deformation which may occur when the counter connector is inserted or removed can be provided.</p>
    <p>Further, because according to this invention, the ground plate has a plurality of contact portions to achieve ground fitting contact and a plurality of the soldering terminals as a single plate (as a single part), ground condition is excellent and grounding is accurate and complete. Further, because the spring portion of the ground contact portion comes into contact with the shell through plural points, it is possible to provide a socket connector having an excellent ground condition.</p>
    <p>Further, because, according to this invention, the signal contact is of a simple sheet-like structure, it is possible to provide a socket connector in which impedance matching is made easy.</p>
    <p>Further, because according to this invention, the folding portion is provided at a portion to be connected to the counter plug connector of the shell, the counter connector can be introduced easily and additionally, the cutout portion makes it difficult for the contacting end portion to be buckled or deformed by the ground plate. The folding portion intensifies the strength of the socket connector and eliminates the necessity of the insulator at this position thereof, thereby reducing the height of the product.</p>
    <p>Therefore, according to this invention, it is possible to provide a socket connector capable of meeting high speed transmission and having a small size and an excellent operability.</p>
    <p>Further, according to this invention, it is possible to provide a high speed transmission connector comprising a plug connector and socket connector having the above described advantages.</p>
