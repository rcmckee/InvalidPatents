No. 298,603 filed Jan. 18, 1989 which is based on United Kingdom Application No. 8802313, filed Feb. 3, 1988. All of these applications are hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention relates to polymer compositions capable of being formed by heat and pressure into articles having dimensional stability and enhanced physical properties, and to pre-mixes useful for preparing these compositions. These compositions and pre-mixes comprise destructurized starch and other polymers as described herein.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>It is known that natural starch found in vegetable products that contains a defined amount of water can be treated at an elevated temperature and in a closed volume, thereby at elevated pressures, to form a melt. The process is conveniently carried out in an injection molding machine or extruder. The starch is fed through the hopper onto a rotating, reciprocating screw. The feed material moves along the screw towards the tip. During this process, the temperature of the material is increased by means of external heaters around the outside of the barrel and by the shearing action of the screw. Starting in the feed zone and continuing in the compression zone, the particulate feed becomes gradually molten. It is then conveyed through the metering zone, where homogenization of the melt occurs, and then to the end of the screw. The molten material at the tip can then be treated further by injection molding or extrusion or any other known technique to treat thermoplastic melts, to obtain shaped articles.</p>
    <p>This treatment, which is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,673,438, which patent is incorporated herein by reference, yields a substantially destructurized starch. As described in the above-mentioned patent, the reason for the destructurizing is that the starch is heated above the glass transition and the melting temperatures of its components. As a consequence, a melting and disordering of the molecular structure of the starch granules takes place, so that a substantially destructurized starch is obtained. The expression "destructurized starch" defines starch obtained by such thermoplastic melt formation. Reference is also made to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 209,151, filed June 20, 1988, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,900,361, Ser. No. 209,402, filed June 20, 1988 and now abandoned and Ser. No. 278,116, filed Nov. 30, 1988 and now abandoned, which further describe destructurized starch, methods for making it, and uses of it. These applications are also incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <p>It is preferred that the destructurized starch used in the present invention has been heated to a high enough temperature and for a time long enough so that the specific endothermic transition analysis as represented by a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curve indicates that a specific relatively narrow peak just prior to oxidative and thermal degradation has disappeared, as described in the above-mentioned application Ser. No. 278,116.</p>
    <p>Destructurized starch is a new and useful material for many applications. An important property is its biodegradability. In humid air, however, destructurized starch takes up water from the air, thereby increasing its moisture content. As a consequence, a shaped article made from destructurized starch may lose its dimensional stability under such conditions. On the other hand, such an article may dry out in low humidity and become brittle.</p>
    <p>Thermoplastic starch has a unique set of properties and, while these properties make destructurized starch very useful, these same properties may limit the utility of destructurized starch in cases where a softer, more resilient or a harder, tougher polymer is desired.</p>
    <p>Thermoplastic starch, as mentioned, can be extruded and molded into numerous useful shapes, profiles and products. However, the processing parameters such as water content, temperature, and pressure must be narrowly controlled to achieve reproducible quality products. This is a further disadvantage for many commercial applications.</p>
    <p>To overcome these potential limitations, it would be useful to increase the dimensional stability over a wide humidity range; to increase the toughness (measured as break energy); to increase the elasticity (measured as elongation); to decrease polymer stiffness (measured as Young's modulus) and to increase the hardness.</p>
    <p>By broadening the processing latitude it is possible to increase the variety of shapes and composites that can be made on a commercial basis and to decrease the need for close controls. It would therefore also be useful to improve the control of the melt strength, e.g. increasing the processing latitude for extruding, injection molding, film blowing or fiber drawing and to control surface tack and adhesion to other substrates.</p>
    <p>Conventional thermoplastic materials are hydrophobic, substantially water-insoluble polymers that are conventionally processed in the absence of water and volatile materials. Starch, on the other hand, forms a melt in the presence of water but decomposes at elevated temperature. i.e. around 240° C. Therefore, it was expected, in view of its hydrophilic nature and chemical structure that such a starch melt would not be useful as a thermoplastic component together with hydrophobic, substantially water-insoluble polymeric materials.</p>
    <p>It has now been found that starch, when heated in a closed volume at proper moisture and temperature conditions as described above to form a melt of destructurized starch, is substantially compatible in its processing with melts formed by hydrophobic substantially water-insoluble thermoplastic polymers and that the two types of molten materials show an interesting combination of properties, especially after the melt has solidified.</p>
    <p>One very important aspect is the surprisingly improved dimensional stability of such destructurized starch blended with such hydrophobic thermoplastic materials. For example, by blending destructurized starch with merely 1% by weight of a thermoplastic synthetic polymer (component (c)), without the use of component (b), a shrinkage of less than 4% is observed after two days in shaped articles such as long, narrow rods. This is to be compared to a shrinkage of up to 40% in length when such articles are comprised only of destructurized starch and are exposed to humidity in the air. Shrinkage in these instances may occur within a few hours. Such polymer compositions are described in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 298,603, filed Jan. 18, 1989.</p>
    <p>Although articles made from such compositions, components (a) and (c) admixed, possess better dimensional stability than those made from destructurized starch alone (component (a)), the physical properties of the therein-described compositions, while useful for certain important applications, are not as good as might be desired for other end uses. In particular, it is important that articles made from destructurized starch compositions retain sufficient strength and dimensional stability to perform their desired functions while still being biodegradable after disposal.</p>
    <p>It has now been found that articles made from such destructurized starch blended with specific hydrophobic thermoplastic materials as described herein show a surprising increase in all or a part of their physical properties and behavior of their melts and overcome the limitations explained above. Moreover, and surprisingly, many of the blends described herein show a significantly improved dimensional stability in humid air compared with non-blended destructurized starch while retaining a surprisingly high degree of disintegration in contact with liquid water, which in consequence leads to a high degree of biodegradability.</p>

    <p>As used herein a "substantially water-insoluble thermoplastic polymer" is a polymer which absorbs less than 10% of water, preferably less than 5%, per 100 grams of the polymer at room temperature and more preferably less than 2% per 100 grams of the polymer at room temperature.</p>
    <p>The term "functional group" as used herein includes known polar groups that may be bound to the polymer chain such as, for example, hydroxy, alkoxy, carboxy, carboxyalkyl, alkyl carboxy, halo, pyrrolidono, acetal and the like. These groups should be selected from those which will not degrade the starch.</p>
    <p>The term "unsaturated monomers containing no functional group" includes for example alkenes such ethylene, isobutylene and propylene. It also includes styrene, as the benzene nucleus is not considered to be a functional group within the scope of this invention.</p>
    <p>The term "carboxylate" as used herein includes groups of the formula</p>
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation">--COO<sup>-</sup> Me<sup>+</sup> </pre>
    
    <p>wherein Me<sup>+</sup> signifies NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup>, or a mono- or polyvalent metallic cation, preferably an alkali or earth alkali cation or zinc, preferably sodium, magnesium or zinc.</p>
    <p>The term "starch" as used herein includes chemically substantially non-modified starches as, for example generally, carbohydrates of natural, vegetable origin, composed mainly of amylose and/or amylopectin. They can be extracted from various plants, examples being potatoes, rice, tapioca, corn (maize), pea, and cereals such as rye, oats and wheat. Preferred is starch made from potatoes, corn, wheat or rice. Mixtures of starches obtained from these sources are contemplated. "Starch" further includes physically modified starches such as gelatinized or cooked starches, starches with a modified acid value (pH), e.g. where acid has been added to lower the acid value of a starch to a range of about 3 to about 6. Further included are starches, e.g. potato starch, in which the divalent ions like Ca<sup>+2</sup> or Mg<sup>+2</sup> -ions associated with the phosphate groups in the potato starch have been partially or completely washed out from the starch or optionally wherein the ions present in the starch have been replaced partially or wholly by the same or different mono- or polyvalent ions. It further includes pre-extruded starches, as described in the above-referenced U.S. patent application Ser. No.  209,402, filed June 20, 1988.</p>
    <p>As described above, it has been found that starches, e.g. with a water content within the range of about 5 to about 40% by weight based on the weight of the composition, undergo a specific narrow endothermic transition on heating to elevated temperatures in a closed volume just prior to the endotherm change characteristic of oxidative and thermal degradation. The specific endothermic transition can be determined by differential scanning calorimetric analysis (DSC) and is indicated on the DSC-diagram by a specific relatively narrow peak just prior to the endotherm characteristic of oxidative and thermal degradation. The peak disappears as soon as the mentioned specific endothermic transition has been undergone. The term "starch" includes also treated starches wherein said specific endothermic transition has been undergone. Such starch is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 278,116 filed Nov. 30, 1988.</p>
    <p>Although at the current time, destructurization of starch requires the presence of water in ranges disclosed herein, the present compositions also contemplate the use of destructurized starch prepared by other methods, e.g. without the use of water.</p>
    <p>The water content of such a starch/water composition is preferably about 5 to about 40% water by weight of the starch/water component and preferably about 5-30%. However, in order to work with the material near its equilibrium water content to which it gets when it is finally exposed to the free atmosphere, a water content of about 10 to about 22%, preferably of about 14 to about 18% by weight, based on the starch/water component, should be used in processing and is preferred.</p>
    <heading>First Embodiment (b-1)</heading> <p>The polymer of component b-1 is preferably a polymer containing vinyl alcohol units. More preferably component b-1 is a poly(vinyl ester) wherein the ester groups are partially hydrolyzed or a copolymer containing vinyl alcohol units as well as other units such as are obtained by copolymerization of vinyl esters, preferably vinyl acetate, with monomers such as ethylene, vinyl chloride, vinyl ethers, acrylo-nitrile, acryl amide, omega-octadecene, vinyl-butyl ether, vinyl-octadecyl ether, vinyl pyrrolidone and other known monomers, with subsequent hydrolysis of at least some of the vinyl-ester groups.</p>
    <p>These polymers of component b-1 have preferably from about 20 to about 99 mol % hydroxyl containing units such as vinyl alcohol units, preferably from about 30 to about 99 mol % and most preferably from 40 to 95 mol % of the hydroxyl containing unit, the remaining units being as mentioned above.</p>
    <p>In addition, component b-1 can be a polymer or copolymer as obtained from polymerizing or copolymerizing monomers of the formula: ##STR1## wherein</p>
    <p>R<sub>2</sub> is hydrogen or methyl,</p>
    <p>X does not form a vinyl alcohol and is an organic moiety with up to 8 carbon atoms substituted by 1 to 3 hydroxyl groups and/or containing 1 or 2 carboxylate groups.</p>
    <p>X can be exemplified by the moiety X<sub>1</sub> wherein X<sub>1</sub> is --CH<sub>2</sub> OH, --O--CH<sub>2</sub> --CH<sub>2</sub> OH, --C(O)OCH<sub>2</sub> --CH<sub>2</sub> OH or --C<sub>6</sub> H<sub>4</sub> --O--CH<sub>2</sub> --CH<sub>2</sub> OH.</p>
    <p>Component b-1 may also be an ester derivative of maleic acid or fumaric acid that optionally contains hydroxyl groups, such as</p>
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation">HOCH<sub>2</sub> --CH<sub>2</sub> --O(O)C--HC═HC--C(O)O--CH<sub>2</sub> --CH<sub>2</sub> OH (Ia)</pre>
    
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation">(cis or trans)</pre>

Such polymers and copolymers are known.</p>
    <p>It is preferred that the polymer does not contain hydroxyl groups together with carboxyl groups bound directly to the same main polymer chain because crosslinking may occur prior to or during processing. However, this does not necessarily always happen and such useful combinations are included within the scope of the present invention.</p>
    <p>The amount of hydroxyl-containing monomer will depend on the type of copolymer used carrying the other functional group. The preferred molar ratios are given above and are generally applicable. However, if the monomer carrying the functional group that is not hydroxyl has an elevated molecular weight compared to the hydroxyl carrying moiety, then a higher proportion of the latter moiety will be required. It is therefore recommended that the weight % of the hydroxyl moiety (--OH) is from 4.5 to 35 and preferably from 9.0 to 25 weight percent of component b-1. If the monomer carries a hydroxyl and at the same time another functional group, e.g., an ester group, no comonomer may be needed because the homopolymer carries two different functional groups. The person skilled in the art can optimize component b-1, e.g., by combining different molar ratios of known monomers or combining other monomers that have not been set out here. Many of these polymers and copolymers are known.</p>

Although such copolymers and their derivatives are known, care must be taken in the case of salts, such as the salts with HCl or H<sub>2</sub> SO<sub>4</sub>, to avoid undesired secondary or alternative reactions. These limitations are known to those skilled in the art.</p>

    <heading>Seventh Embodiment (b-7)</heading> <p>The compounds of component (b-7) are selected from the group consisting of anionically modified polysaccharides.</p>
    <p>Polysaccharides and anionically modified polysaccharides are known and are described e.g. in Encyclopaedia of Polymer Science and Technology, 2nd Edition, 1987.</p>
    <p>Anionically modified polysaccharides are chemically modified polysaccharides in which a part or all of the functional hydroxyl groups of the polysaccharide have been substituted by other groups which contain anionic functional groups.</p>

    <p>Preferred copolymers of component (b-8) are those containing vinyl alcohol units and aliphatic chain units as obtained by copolymerization with ethylene and/or propylene, preferably with ethylene.</p>
    <p>Such polymers are e.g. ethylene/vinyl alcohol copolymers (EVAL), propylene/vinyl alcohol copolymers.</p>

    <heading>Ninth Embodiment (b-9)</heading> <p>The compounds of component (b-9) are selected from the group consisting of polysaccharide graft copolymers and graft copolymers of polysaccharide derivatives.</p>
    <p>Polysaccharides and polysaccharide graft copolymers as well as graft copolymers of polysaccharide derivatives are known and are described e.g. in Encyclopaedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Volume 3, 1986. Polysaccharides are defined as naturally occuring carbohydrate polymers in which monosaccharide units are linked directly through glycosidic linkages. Polysaccharides are originate from plant-, animal- and microbial kingdoms. The preferred polysaccharides are the different starches, celluloses, hemicelluloses, xylanes, gums, alginates, pectins and pullulans. The most preferred are starch and cellulose.</p>
    <p>Polysaccharide derivatives are e.g. polysaccharide ethers, alkoxylated polysaccharides, such as methyl cellulose, hydroxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, or the analogous known derivatives from starch.</p>
    <p>A polysaccharide graft copolymer is a polysaccharide covalently linked to a polymer so that separation by solvent extraction cannot be achieved without first degrading the polysaccharide e.g. by hydrolytic or oxidative degradation. The same is to be said analogously for graft copolymers of polysaccharide derivatives.</p>
    <p>Graft copolymerization results from the formation of an active site at a point on the polysaccharide molecule or its derivative other than its end, and exposure to a polymerizable monomer.</p>
    <p>In this sense, a polysaccharide or its derivative can be graft copolymerized with different polymerizable monomers, which can react with active hydrogen atoms or hydroxyl groups. Such monomers may, preferably, be selected from the group consisting of unsaturated monomers, lactones, alkylimines and lactams.</p>
    <p>Preferred compounds, their weight percent graft, the average number of grafted monomeric units (n) and the average molecular weight of grafted claims (M<sub>w</sub>) are given in Table (b-8)-A.</p>

    <p>More preferred as component (b-10) are polyalkyleneimines as derived from at least one compound selected from the group consisting of ethyleneimine, N-acetyl-ethyleneimine (containing the ═N--CO--CH<sub>3</sub> group) and N-propionyl-ethyleneimine (containing the ═N--CO--C<sub>2</sub> H<sub>5</sub> group).</p>
    <heading>Eleventh Embodiment (b-11)</heading> <p>The compounds of component (b-11) are selected from the group consisting of styrene sulfonic acid polymers, styrene sulfonic acid copolymers and salts thereof.</p>
    <p>Poly(styrene sulfonic acid) compounds, styrene sulfonic acid copolymers, both with different degrees of sulfonation, their corresponding sulfonates (salts) as well as the method for their production are known and described, e.g. in Encyclopaedia of Polymer and Engineering, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1987.</p>
    <p>Poly(styrene sulfonic acid), i.e. styrene sulfonic acid polymers useful according to this invention have a molecular weight generally from about 2000 to about 1,500,000, preferably from about 4000 to about 1,200,000.</p>
    <p>Styrene sulfonic acid copolymers are known and can be described as copolymers of different unsaturated monomers with styrene sulfonic acid, for example their sulfonates.</p>
    <p>As a special interest within the scope of this invention are block copolymers of sulfonated styrene with unsaturated monomers such as ethylene, propylene, butylene, isobutylene, butadiene, isoprene, and/or styrene.</p>
    <p>Preferred salts thereof, including the corresponding sulfonates are their salts with metal ions or the ammonium ion, preferably an alkali metal ion, magnesium or zinc or NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup>, preferably sodium, potassium or zinc, preferably the sodium salt.</p>
    <p>Preferred are polystyrene sulfonic acids and polystyrene sulfonate sodium salts preferably with an average molecular weight of 10,000 to 400,000. The degree of sulfonation is between about 5% and about 100%, preferably between about 10% and about 50%.</p>
    <heading>Twelfth Embodiment (b-12)</heading> <p>The component (b-12) is a compound selected from the group consisting of polymers and copolymers which contain carboxylic groups in the form of their salts as further defined hereinbelow.</p>
    <p>Polymers and copolymers thus obtained are known per se and may have a general formula wherein the number of repeating units varies for each individual type of polymer resp. copolymer as e.g. described in "Encyclopaedia of Polymer Science and Technology, Interscience Publ. Vol. 14, 1971".</p>
    <p>Such polymers in their salt form are obtained by polymerization of e.g. acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, maleic acid, maleic acid anhydride, itaconic acid, itaconic acid anhydride or a mixture of such acids and subsequent salt formation of a part or of all the carboxyl groups.</p>
    <p>The polymers and copolymers of component (b-12) do not contain further functional groups. The term "functional group" as used herein includes all known polar groups that may be bound to the polymer chain such as, for example, hydroxyl alkoxy, carboxylalkyl, alkyl carboxy, halo, pyrrolidono, acetal and the like.</p>
    <p>Copolymers of component (b-12) are further those wherein said acids have been copolymerized with one or more unsaturated monomers containing no functional groups. The term "unsaturated monomers containing no functional group" includes for example alkenes such ethylene, isobutylene, proypylene, etc. It also includes styrene, as the benzene nucleus but this is not considered to be a functional group within the scope of this invention.</p>
    <p>Copolymers in their salt form useful as component (b-12) therefore contain carboxyl groups in their salt form as well as other units as are obtained by copolymerization of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, maleic acid, itaconic acid, with monomers such as ethylene, butylene isobutylene, propylene, isoprene, butadiene and/or styrene or other known monomers of this class with subsequent salt formation. Such copolymers are known.</p>
    <p>Preferred is a copolymer of said acids With ethylene, e.g. the ethylene-acrylic-acid copolymer in the form of its salt or an ethylene-methacrylic acid copolymer in the form of its salt.</p>

    <p>R is alkyl (C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>18</sub>), or alkylene carrying further</p>
    <p>N<sup>+</sup> R<sub>1</sub> R<sub>2</sub> R<sub>3</sub> residues;</p>
    <p>R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>, independent of each other, are hydrogen, or an alkyl(C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>4</sub>).</p>
    <p>Said organic base cation can also be a positively charged pyridine residue, carbazyl residue or p-amino-phenyl residue.</p>
    <p>Preferably M is sodium or zinc wherein the polymer contains also free carboxyl groups.</p>
    <p>Such obtained repeating units in the polymer carrying carboxylate groups can be exemplified by the following formulas: ##STR28## where</p>
    <p>R is H, CH<sub>3</sub>, --COOH or --COOM</p>
    <p>R' is H, CH<sub>3</sub> or --CH<sub>2</sub> --COOH or --CH<sub>2</sub> --COOM</p>
    <p>M is as defined above.</p>
    <p>Preferred copolymers are those containing repeating units as exemplified in the formulas (XXXIV) and (XXXV). ##STR29##</p>
    <p>The amount of carboxyl and carboxylate containing monomeric moiety within a copolymer will depend on the type of copolymer. Said amount will generally be between 3 mol % and 40 mole %, preferably between 3.5 mol % and 30 mol % and most preferably between 3.5 mol % and 20 mol % calculated to the total amount of monomeric moieties within the molecule.</p>
    <p>The degree of neutralization of the carboxyl groups to form the carboxylates is preferably from 30% to 100%. More preferred is a degree of neutralization of 40% to 90%.</p>

    <p>Acid groups such as carboxyl groups and hydroxyl groups such as hydroxymethyl, hydroxypropyl or vinyl alcohol groups may react together prior or during processing. It is therefore a precaution that carboxyl groups and hydroxyl groups which may react together to the disadvantage of the blend system are absent, especially with component (b-7). However, this does not necessarily always happen and such useful combinations, which for the person skilled in the art are a matter of system optimization, are included within the scope of the present invention.</p>
    <p>Such polymers may be used in any known form. Their molecular weight is also generally known in the art. It is also possible to use such polymers of relatively low molecular weight (oligomers).

    <p>The preferred ratio of destructurized starch to component (b-11) differs slightly from the other embodiments which the ratio may vary from about 99:1 to 70:30 preferably it is from about 98:2 to about 80:20. Most preferred is a ratio from about 95:5 to about 90:10.  The ratio of destructurized starch to the sum of components (b-11) and (c) can be 1:99 to 99:1. It is however, preferred that the destructurized starch contributes noticeably to the properties of the final material. Therefore, it is preferred that the destructurized starch is present in an amount of at least about 20%, more preferably about 50% and most preferably in the range of about 60% to about 95% by weight of the entire composition.

    <p>The ratio of destructurized starch to component (b-12) is preferably from about 10:90 to about 99:1, preferably from about 30:70 to about 95:5. Most preferred is a ratio from about 50:50 to about 90:10.</p>
    <p>The ratio of destructurized starch to the sum of components (b-12) and (c) can be 1:99 to 99:1. It is however, preferred that the destructurized starch contributes noticeably to the properties of the final material. Therefore, it is preferred that the destructurized starch is present in an amount of at least 20%, more preferably about 40% and most preferably in the range of about 60% to about 90% by weight of the entire composition. That is, the sum of the components (b) and (c) are present in amounts of about 80% or less, more preferably less than or equal to about 60% and most preferably in the range of about 40% to about 10% by weight of the entire composition.</p>
    <p>In the thirteenth embodiment, the ratio of the water-containing destructurized starch to component (c) can be 0.1:99.9 to 99.9:0.1. It is however preferred that the destructurized starch contributes noticeably to the properties of the final material. Therefore, it is preferred that the destructurized starch is present in an amount of at least 50% and more preferably in the range of 70% to 99.5% by weight of the entire composition, i.e. the synthetic polymer is present in a concentration of less than 50% and more preferably in a concentration in the range of 30% to 0.5% by weight of the entire composition.</p>
    <p>A mixture of 0.5 to 15% by weight of the synthetic polymer (component (c)) and 99.5 to 85% of the water containing destructurized starch shows already a significant improvement in the properties of the obtained materials. For certain applications a ratio of the synthetic polymer to the starch/water component of 0.5-5% to 99.5-95% is preferred and especially a ratio of 0.5-2% to 99.5-98% by weight.</p>
    <p>Component (b) is a relatively polar material. When it functions in the present compositions in combination with component (c), it is able to mix more readily with a more polar component (c) than with a less polar one. Accordingly, with components (c) that are more polar, relatively less of component (b) will be required than with less components (c) that are less polar. The skilled worker will be able to select appropriate ratios of components (b) and (c) to obtain a substantially homogenous melt composition.</p>
    <p>Compositions comprising 1 to 15% by weight of component (b) or the sum of the components (b) and (c) and 99 to 85% of destructurized starch show a significant improvement in the properties of the obtained materials. For certain applications the preferred ratio of component (b) or the sum of components (b) and (c) to the destructurized starch component is about 1 to about 10% to about 99 to about 90% by weight of the total composition. If the destructurized starch contains water, the percentage of this destructurized starch component present is meant include the weight of water.</p>
    <p>The starch may be mixed prior to destructurization with additives as named hereinbelow to yield a free flowing powder useful for continuous processing or may be destructurized and granulated before it is mixed with components (b) or (b) and (c) or (c) alone or the other optionally added components. Thus, the starch may be partially or wholly destructurized prior to being mixed with other components or additives, and in the former case further destructurized during additional processing. The other components to be added are preferably granulated to a granular size equal to that of the granulated destructurized starch.</p>
    <p>However, it is possible to process native starch or pre-extruded and/or destructurized granulated or powdered starch together with powdered or granulated additives and/or the polymeric material in any desired mixture or sequence.</p>
    <p>Thus, it is preferred that components (a), (b) and (c) as well as other conventional additives be mixed in a standard mixer. This mixture can then be passed through an extruder to produce granulates or pellets as one form of shaped articles which are also useful as starting material for processing into other articles. However, it is possible to avoid granulating and to process the obtained melt directly using down-stream equipment to produce films, blown films including, sheets, profiles, pipes, tubes, foams or other shaped articles. The sheets can be used for thermoforming.</p>
    <p>It is preferred that fillers, lubricants and/or plasticizers be added to the starch before destructurization. However the addition of coloring agents as well as of the components (b), (c) and additives other than the aforementioned can be added before, during or after destructurization.</p>
    <p>The substantially destructurized starch/water component or granules have a water content in the range of about 10 to about 22% by weight of the starch/water component, preferably about 10 to 20%, more preferably about 12 to about 19% and most preferably about 14 to about 18% by weight of the starch/water component.</p>
    <p>The water content described above refers to the percentage of water relative to the weight of the starch/water component within the total composition and not to the weight of the total composition itself, which would include also the weight of any added substantially water-insoluble thermoplastic polymer.</p>
    <p>In order to destructurize the starch and/or to form a melt of the new polymeric composition according to this invention, it is suitably heated in a screw and barrel of an extruder for a time long enough to effectuate destructurization and melt formation. The temperature is preferably within the range of 105° C. to 240° C., more preferably within the range of 130° C. to 190° C. depending on the type of starch used. For this destructurization and melt formation, the composition is heated in a closed volume. A closed volume can be a closed vessel or the volume created by the sealing action of the unmolten feed material as happens in the screw and barrel of injection molding or extrusion equipment. In this sense the screw and barrel of an injection molding machine or an extruder is to be understood as being a closed vessel. Pressures created in a closed vessel correspond to the vapor pressure of water at the temperature used but of course additional pressure may be applied and/or generated as normally occurs in a screw and barrel. The preferred applied and/or generated pressures are in the range of pressures which occur in extrusion and are known per se, e.g. from 5 to 150×10<sup>5</sup> N/m<sup>2</sup> preferably from 5 to 75×10<sup>5</sup> N/m<sup>2</sup> and most preferably from 5 to 50×10<sup>5</sup> N/m<sup>2</sup>. If the thus-obtained composition is comprised only of destructurized starch, it may be granulated and ready to be mixed with the further components according to a chosen mixing and processing procedure to obtain the granular mixture of the destructurized starch/polymer starting material to be fed to the screw barrel.</p>
    <p>However, the obtained melt in the screw and barrel may be injection molded directly into a suitable mold, i.e. directly further processed to a final product if all necessary components are already present.</p>
    <p>Within the screw, the granular mixture obtained as described above is heated to a temperature which is generally within the range of about 80° C. to about 240° C., preferably within the range of about 120° C. to about 220° C. and most preferably within the range of about 130° C. to about 190° C. Preferably, such mixture is heated to a sufficiently high temperature and for a time long enough until the endothermic transition analysis (DSC) indicates that the specific relatively narrow peak just prior to the endotherm characteristic of oxidative and thermal degradation of starch has disappeared.</p>
    <p>The minimum pressures under which the melts are formed correspond to the water vapor pressures produced at said temperatures. The process is carried out in a closed volume as explained above, i.e. in the range of the pressures which occur in extrusion or molding processes and known per se, e.g. from zero to 150×10<sup>5</sup> N/m<sup>2</sup> preferably from zero to 75×10<sup>5</sup> N/m<sup>2</sup> and most preferably from zero to 50×10<sup>5</sup> N/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
    <p>When forming a shaped article by extrusion, the pressures are preferably as mentioned above. If the melt according to this invention is, e.g., injection molded, the normal range of injection pressures used in injection molding is applied, e.g. from 300×10<sup>5</sup> N/m<sup>2</sup> to 3000×10<sup>5</sup> N/m<sup>2</sup> and preferably from 700×10<sup>5</sup> to 2200×10<sup>5</sup> N/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>

If any hydrophilic polymer is added, its mass should be considered along with the starch in determining the appropriate amount of water in the composition.</p>
    <p>Other useful additives include, without limitation, adjuvants, fillers, lubricants, mold release agents, plasticizers, foaming agents, stabilizers, coloring agents, pigments, extenders, chemical modifiers, flow accelerators, flavorings, fragrances and mixtures thereof.</p>
    <p>Examples of fillers are inorganic fillers, such as the oxides of magnesium, aluminum, silicon, titanium, and the like, preferably in a concentration in the range of about 0.02 to about 3% by weight, and more preferably about 0.20 to about 1% based on the total weight of all the components.</p>

The articles include bottles, sheets, films, packaging materials, pipes, rods, laminated films, sacks, bags, pharmaceutical capsules, granules, powders or foams.</p>
    <p>For example, these compositions may be used to prepare low density packaging materials (e.g. foams) by any known methods. Conventional blowing agents may be utilized if desired or, for certain compositions, the water itself may act as the blowing agent. Open cell and closed cell foams may be produced as desired by varying the composition and processing conditions. These foams produced from the present compositions will demonstrate improved properties (e.g., dimensional stability, moisture resistance, etc.) when compared with foams made of starch without incorporation of the components (b) and (c) according to this invention.</p>
    <p>These compositions may be used as carrier materials for active substances, and may be mixed with active ingredients, such as pharmaceuticals and/or agriculturally active compounds such as insecticides or pesticides for subsequent release applications of these ingredients. The resulting extruded materials can be granulated or worked to fine powders.</p>

    <heading>Example (b-1)-1</heading> <p>(a) 5000 g of potato starch containing 14.87% water were placed in a high speed mixer and 485 g of water were added under stirring. To the above mixture of starch and water, 425 g of polyvinyl alcohol-co-vinyl acetate, (component (b-1)) containing 11%-13% of the monomeric units as vinyl acetate and 87%-89% of the monomeric units as vinyl alcohol sold as Airvol 540S by Air Products, Allentown, Pa.; and 42 g of polyethylene-co-vinyl acetate (component (c)) containing 80% of the monomeric units as ethylene and 20% of the monomeric units as vinyl acetate sold as Escorene UL02020 by Exxon, New York, N.Y.; 42.5 g of hydrogenated fat (lubricant/release agent) sold as Boeson VP by Boehringer Ingelheim; 21.25 g of a melt flow accelerator (lecithin) sold as Metarin P by Lucas Meyer and 21.25 g of titanium dioxide (pigment and solid mixture flow accelerator) were added under stirring. The water content of the final mixture was 19.98%.</p>
    <p>(b) 5000 g of the mixture prepared under (a) were fed through a hopper into a Leistritz Single Screw Lab Extruder LSM 30 having a temperature profile of 55° C./ 145° C./ 165° C./ 165° C. The screw speed was 50 rpm. The output of extrudate was 124 g/min.</p>
    <p>The extrudate was cut into granulates and stored for further processing.</p>
    <p>(c) For further processing the granulates were conditioned to a water content of 17% by adding water under stirring in a conventional mixer. The obtained material was then fed through a hopper to a Kloeckner-Ferromatic FM 60 injection-molding machine, for the production of tensile test pieces. The temperature profile was 90° C./ 155° C./ 155° C./ 155° C., the screw speed: 180 rpm, the shot weight 8.2 g, the residence time 450 sec., the injection pressure 1800 bar, the back pressure 30 bar.</p>
    <p>All tensile test pieces were conditioned in a climatic cabinet at 50% R.H. for five days as an arbitrary standard condition.</p>
    <p>The test pieces were of standard DIN design (DIN No. 53455).</p>
    <p>(d) The conditioned tensile test pieces were then tested for their stress/strain behavior on an Instron tensile test apparatus, each test with 4 pieces.</p>
    <p>The samples were measured at room temperature using an extension rate of 10 mm per minute. Results are presented in Table 1 and compared with those obtained with tensile test pieces obtained from the same starch processed in a similar way but in absence of components (b) and (c). It can be seen from the results that the Young's modulus of the ternary blend is decreased from 1.56 to 1.29 showing a softening of the injection molded blend material compared to similar tensile test pieces produced from unblended starch.</p>
    <p>The break stress goes from 32.72 MPa to 37.22 MPa indicating an increase of the strength of the blend. The break strain (elongation at break) going from 15.82% to 33.33% and break energy from 194.30 kJ/m<sup>2</sup> to 415.75 kJ/m<sup>2</sup> showing a considerable increase in the toughness of the blend material over the unblended one.</p>

    <p>Of course different blend compositions show different values for the physical parameters indicated. To obtain the best values is a matter of optimization by varying the concentration of the different components, which is no problem to the expert in the art.</p>

    <p>The resulting injection molded polymers are tougher and more resistant to humid air than the unmodified starch polymer. The toughness as judged by resistance to breaking upon bending increases from blend 9 to blend 2 in concert with the combined increase in vinyl alcohol content. While the resistance to softening in humid atmosphere is improved in all cases relative to unmodified starch, the resistance of blends 1,4,5 and 6 are particularly good. These results illustrate the unexpected combinations as benefits in performance.</p>

    <heading>EXAMPLE (b-1)-18</heading> <p>Example (b-1)-1 (Sections (a) and (b)) is repeated except that the water content is adjusted to 22%, and the cutter is removed from the die face. A continuous extrudate is obtained which is foamed as a result of the excess water evaporation. The foam is chopped into 30-40 mm lengths and is useful as a loose-fill, packaging insulation material.</p>
    <heading>Example (b-1)-19</heading> <p>During each of the injection molding operations in Examples (b-1)-2-14 an experiment is performed to demonstrate the utility of making foams. The molten material was obtained as described in Example (b-1)-1, Sections a), b) and c) in each case was extruded into the open atmosphere (Section c) instead of being injection molded into a closed mold. In every case the material is converted into a foamed extrudate useful for loose-fill in packaging applications.</p>
    <heading>Example (b-1)-20</heading> <p>The granulates from Example (b-1)-1 are mixed with polystyrene in the proposition of 30 to 70 parts by weight and are treated according to Example (b-1)-18. The resulting foamed extrudate contains a very fine and uniform structure suitable for a variety of uses including structural foam.</p>
    <heading>Example (b-2)-1</heading> <p>(a) 5000 g of potato starch containing 14.87% water are placed in a high speed mixer and 485 g of water are added under stirring. To the above mixture of starch and water, 425 g of crotonic acid-co-vinyl acetate, sodium salt (component (b)) containing 13% of the monomeric units as vinyl acetate and 87% of the monomeric units as crotonic acid of which 90% are in form of sodium salt and 42 g of polyethylene-co-vinyl acetate (component (c)) containing 80% of the monomeric units as ethylene and 20% of the monomeric units as vinyl acetate (sold as Escorene UL02020 by Exxon); 42.5 g of hydrogenated fat (lubricant/release agent) sold as Boeson VP by Boehringer Ingelheim; 21.25 g of a melt flow accelerator (lecithin) and 21.25 g of titanium dioxide (pigment and solid mixture flow accelerator) are added under stirring. The water content of the final mixture is 20%.</p>
    <p>(b) 5000 g of the mixture prepared under (a) are fed through a hopper into a Leistritz Single Screen Lab Extruder LSM 30 having a temperature profile of 55° C./145° C./165° C./165° C. with an output of extrudate of 100 g/min.</p>
    <p>The extrudate is cut into granulates and the water content is determined to be 13.10%. The granulates are then brought back to a water content of 17% by spraying of water under stirring in a conventional mixer.</p>
    <p>(c) The granulates of the pre-blended mixture as obtained under (b) are fed through a hopper to an injection-molding machine Kloeckner-Ferromatic FM 60, for the production of tensile test pieces. The processing conditions are the following: temperature profile: 90° C./155° C./155° C./155° C., shot weight: 8.2 g, residence time: 450 sec., injection pressure: 1800 bar, back pressure: 30 bar.</p>
    <p>All the tensile test pieces are conditioned in a climatic cabinet at 50% R.H. for five days as an arbitrary standard condition.</p>
    <p>The test pieces are of standard DIN design (DIN No. 53455).</p>
    <p>(d) The conditioned tensile test pieces are then tested for their stress/strain behavior on an Instron tensile test apparatus, each test with 4 pieces.</p>
    <p>The samples are measured at room temperature using an extension rate of 10 mm per minute. Results are presented in Table (b-2)-1 and compared with those obtained with tensile test pieces obtained from the same starch processed in a similar way but in absence of components (b) and (c).</p>
    <p>The break strain (elongation at break) going from 15.82% to 31.20% and break energy from 194.30 kJ/m<sup>2</sup> to 395.25 kJ/m<sup>2</sup> showing a considerable increase in the toughness of the blend material over the unblended one.</p>

    <p>The resulting injection molded polymers are tougher and more resistant to humid air than the unmodified starch polymer. The toughness as judged by resistance to breaking upon bending increases from blend 9 to blend 2 in concert with the combined increase in polyvinyl pyrrolidone-co-vinyl acetate content. While the resistance to softening in humid atmosphere is improved in all cases relative to unmodified starch, the resistance of blends 1,4,5 and 6 are particularly good.

The resulting injection molded polymer blend is tougher and more resistant to humid air than unblended starch.</p>
    <heading>Example (b-5)-9</heading> <p>(a) 10,000 g of potato starch containing 15.2% H<sub>2</sub> O are placed in a high speed mixer and 85 g of polyvinyl alcohol-co-vinyl acetate (component (c)) containing 87-89 mole % of vinyl alcohol units and 11-13 mole % of vinyl acetate units sold as Airvol 5405 by Air Products are added under stirring and then 85 g of hydrogenated fat (lubricant, release agent), 42.5 g of a melt flow accelerator (lecithin) and 42.5 g of titanium dioxide (pigment and solid mixture flow accelerator) are added under stirring. The water content of the final mixture is 14.8%.</p>
    <p>(b) This part is conducted in an identical way as part (b) of Example (b-5)-1, but using as component (b) poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone-vinyl acetate, 54:46) type Kollidon VA-64 sold by Bayer and added at 2 kg/hr by means of a separate dosing unit.</p>

The water content of the final mixture is 13.8%.</p>
    <p>(b) 8000 g of the mixture prepared under (a) are fed through a hopper into a Werner &amp; Pfleiderer co-rotating twin screw extruder (model Continua 37). The temperature profile of the four sections of the barrel is 20° C./80° C./230° C./150° C., respectively.</p>
    <p>Extrusion is carried out with a mixture output of 8.2 kg/hr (screw speed 200 rpm). Water is added at the inlet with a flow rate of 2.9 kg/hr. The water content of the material during extrusion is therefore 37%. In the last section of the extruder 600 mbar reduced pressure is applied to remove part of the water as water vapor.</p>
    <p>The water content of the granulates is 9.5% as measured after they have equilibrated at room temperature. They are brought to a water content of 17% by spraying water under stirring in a conventional mixer.</p>
    <p>(c) The granulates of the pre-blended mixture as obtained under (b) (H<sub>2</sub> O content: 17%) are fed through a hopper to an Arburg 329-210-750 injection molding machine for the production of tensile test pieces. The temperature profile of the barrel is: 90° C./ 155° C./155° C./155° C.</p>
    <p>The shot weight is 7.8 g, the residence time 450 sec., the injection pressure 1800 bar, the back pressure 80 bar, the screw speed 180 rpm.</p>

    <p>The test pieces are of standard DIN design (DIN No. 53455).</p>
    <p>(d) The conditioned tensile test pieces are then tested for their stress/strain behavior on a Zwick tensile test apparatus as given in Example (b-5)-1.</p>
    <p>The resulting injection molded polymer blend is tougher and more resistant to humid air than unblended starch.</p>
    <heading>Example (b-5)-11</heading> <p>Example (b-5)-1 (Sections a) and b)) is repeated except that the water content of the potato starch is adjusted to 22%, and the cutter is removed from the die face. A continuous extrudate is obtained which is foamed as a result of the excess water evaporation. The foam is chopped into 30-40 mm lengths and is useful as a loose-fill, packaging insulation material.</p>
    <heading>Example (b-5)-12</heading> <p>During each of the injection molding operations in Examples (b-5)-1 through (b-5)-10, an experiment is performed to demonstrate the utility of making foams. The molten material is obtained as described in Example (b-5)-1, Sections a), b) and c) in each case is extruded into the open atmosphere (Section c) instead of being injection molded into a closed mold. In every case the material is converted into a foamed extrudate useful for loose-fill in packaging applications.</p>
    <heading>Example (b-5)-13</heading> <p>The granulates from Example (b-5)-1 are mixed with polystyrene in the proportion of 30 to 70 parts by weight and are treated according to Example (b-5)-12.

    <heading>Example (b-6)-1</heading> <p>(a) 5000 g of potato starch containing 16.0% water were placed in a high speed mixer and 451 g of water were added under stirring. To the above mixture of starch and water, 42 g of 2-hydroxy-3-trimethyl ammonium chloride propyl starch ether (DS=0.05) (component (b)); 425 g of polyethylene-co-vinyl alcohol (component (c)) containing 71 mole % of vinyl alcohol and 29 mole % of ethylene sold as Clarene L-4 by Solvay; 42.5 g of hydrogenated fat (lubricant/release agent) sold as Boeson VP by Boehringer Ingelheim; 21.25 g of a melt flow accelerator (lecithin) sold as Metarin P by Lucas Meyer and 21.25 g of titanium dioxide (pigment and solid mixture flow accelerator) were added under stirring. The water content of the final mixture was 20.8%.</p>
    <p>(b) 5000 g of the mixture prepared under (a) were fed through a hopper into a Leistritz Single Screw Lab Extruder LSM 30 having a temperature profile of 55° C./145° C./165° C./165° C. The screw speed was 50 rpm. The output of extrudate was 110 g/min.</p>
    <p>The extrudate was cut into granulates and stored for further processing.</p>
    <p>(c) For further processing, the granulates were conditioned to a water content of 17% by adding water under stirring in a conventional mixer. The obtained material was then fed through a hopper to a Kloeckner-Ferromatic FM 60 injection-molding machine, for the production of tensile test pieces. The temperature profile was 90° C./155° C./155° C./155° C., the screw speed: 180 rpm, the shot weight 8.8 g, the residence time 450 sec., the injection pressure 1450 bar, the back pressure 30 bar.</p>

    <p>The test pieces were of standard DIN design (DIN No. 53455).</p>
    <p>(d) The conditioned tensile test pieces were then tested for their stress/strain behavior on an Instron tensile test apparatus, each test with 4 pieces.</p>
    <p>The samples were measured at room temperature using an extension rate of 10 mm per minute. Results were presented in Table (b-6)-1 and compared with those obtained with tensile test pieces obtained from the same starch processed in a similar way but in absence of components (b) and (c). It can be seen from the results that the break strain (elongation at break) went from 15.82% to 42% and break energy from 194.3 kJ/m<sup>2</sup> to 485 kJ/m<sup>2</sup> showing a considerable increase in the toughness of the blend material over the unblended one.</p>

    <p>Of course, different blend compositions show different values for the physical parameters indicated. To obtain the best values is a matter of optimization by varying the concentration of the different components, a procedure known to one skilled in the art.</p>

    <p>The resulting injection molded polymers were tougher and more resistant to humid air than the unmodified starch polymer. The toughness as judged by resistance to breaking upon bending increases from blend 9 to blend 2 in concert with the combined increase in cationic starch content. While the resistance to softening in humid atmosphere is improved in all cases relative to unmodified starch, the resistance of blends 1,4,5 and 6 are particularly good. These results illustrate the unexpected combinations as benefits in performance.</p>

    <heading>Example (b-8)-14</heading> <p>During each of the injection molding operations in Examples (b-8)-2 through (b-8)-12 an experiment is performed to demonstrate the utility of making foams.

    <p>The extrudate is cut into granulates and stored for further processing.</p>
    <p>(c) For further processing the granulates are conditioned to a water content of 17% by adding water under stirring in a conventional mixer. The obtained material is then fed through a hopper to a Kloeckner-Ferromatic FM 60 injection-molding machine, for the production of tensile test pieces. The temperature profile is 90° C./155° C./155° C./155° C., the screw speed: 180 rpm, the shot weight 8.4 g, the residence time 450 sec., the injection pressure 1200 bar, the back pressure 30 bar.</p>
    <p>All tensile test pieces are conditioned in a climatic cabinet at 50% R.H. for five days as an arbitrary standard condition.</p>
    <p>The test pieces are of standard DIN design (DIN No. 53455).</p>
    <p>(d) The conditioned tensile test pieces are then tested for their stress/strain behavior on an Instron tensile test apparatus, each test with 4 pieces.</p>
    <p>The samples are measured at room temperature using an extension rate of 10 mm per minute. Results are presented in Table (b-9)-1 and compared with those obtained with tensile test pieces obtained from the same starch processed in a similar way but in absence of components b) and c) (Example (b-9)-1).

    <p>The resulting injection molded polymers are tougher and more resistant to humid air than the unblended starch polymer. The toughness as judged by resistance to breaking upon bending increases from blend 9 to blend 2 in concert with the combined increase in the content of the sodium salt of poly(styrene sulfonic acid. While the resistance to softening in humid atmosphere is improved in all cases relative to unblended starch, the resistance of blends 1,4,5 and 6 are particularly good.

    <heading>Example (b-11)-10</heading> <p>Example (b-11)-9 is repeated, replacing component (b) (poly(styrene sulfonic acid, sodium salt) by the sodium salt of a sulfonated diblock-copolymer made of polystyrene (block A), and polyethylene-co-propylene (block B). The sulfonation is carried out on the polystyrene block of Kraton G 1701 a commercial product sold by Shell in which block A contains 37% by weight of styrene units and block B contains 63% by weight of ethylene-propylene units. The sulfonation is made using acetyl sulfate as reagent which is prepared by stirring a mixture of 9.8 g concentrated sulfuric acid, 10.2 g acetic anhydride and 200 ml of dichloromethane for 30 minutes at room temperature.</p>
    <p>This mixture is then added slowly to a solution of 30 g Kraton G 1701 in 300 ml CH2C12 The color of the reaction mixture changes from red to dark brown after about 30 minutes during which time the polymer precipitates. The mixture is stirred another 4 hours to complete the reaction. Then 500 ml of water are added, the mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and the organic solvent is removed. The aqueous phase which contains the polymer is neutralized with a 50% NaOH-solution. The solid is collected by vacuum filtration, thoroughly washed with deionized water and dried over P205 30.6 g are obtained (yield: 82%). The material is characterized by its infra-red spectrum which shows a strong characteristic sulfonate band at 1200 cm<sup>-1</sup> and a medium characteristic sulfonate band at 1050 cm<sup>-1</sup>.</p>
    <p>The resulting injection-molded polymer is tougher and more resistant to humid air than unblended starch polymer.</p>

Water is added at the inlet with a flow rate of 2.1 kg/hr. The water content of the material during extrusion is therefore 32%. In the last section of the extruder 500 mbar reduced pressure is applied to remove part of the water as water vapor.</p>
    <p>The water content of the granulates is 16.9% as measured after they have equilibrated at room temperature.</p>
    <p>(c) The granulates of the pre-blended mixture as obtained under (b) (H<sub>2</sub> O content 16.9) are fed through a hopper to an injection molding machine Arburg 329-210-750 for the production of tensile test pieces.

    <p>The shot weight is 7.9 g, the residence time 450 sec., the injection pressure 2090 bar, the back pressure 80 bar, the screw speed 180 rpm.</p>
    <p>The tensile test pieces thus produced are conditioned in a climatic cabinet at 50% R.H. for five days as an arbitrary standard condition.</p>
    <p>The test pieces are of standard DIN design (DIN No. 53455).</p>
    <p>(d) The conditioned tensile test pieces are then tested for their stress/strain behavior on a Zwick tensile test apparatus.</p>
    <p>The samples are measured at room temperature using an extension rate of 10 mm per minute. Results are presented in Table (b-12)-1 and compared with those of the tensile test pieces obtained from the same starch processed in a similar way but in absence of components (b) and (c).</p>

    <p>The resulting injection molded polymers are tougher and more resistant to humid air than the unblended starch polymer. The toughness as judged by resistance to breaking upon bending increases from blend 9 to blend 2 in concert with the combined increase in polyethylene-co-methacrylic acid, sodium salt (Surlyn 8528) content. While the resistance to softening in humid atmosphere is improved in all cases relative to unblended starch, the resistance of blends 1,4,5 and 6 are particularly good.

    <heading>Example (c-1)-1</heading> <p>(a) Preparation of destructurized starch granulates.</p>
    <p>Natural potato starch, a lubricant/release agent (hydrogenated fat) and a melt flow accelerator (lecithin) and titanium dioxide were mixed together in the relative proportions in a powder mixer for 10 minutes so that a composition consisting of 80.6 parts of natural potato starch, one part of the hydrogenated triglyceride of the fatty acid C<sub>18</sub> :C<sub>16</sub> :C<sub>14</sub> in a ratio of 65:31:4 weight percent, 0.7 parts lecithin, 0.7 parts of titanium dioxide and 17 parts water in the form of a freely flowing powder is obtained. This material was then fed to the hopper of an extruder. In the screw barrel the powder was melted. The temperature within the barrel was measured to be 175° C., the average total residence time was 12 minutes (approximately 10 minutes heating time, approximately 2 minutes in molten state) and the pressure generated was equal to the vapor pressure of the moisture present in the volume of the extruder barrel. The melt was then extruded, and cut into granulates of an average diameter of 2 to 3 mm. The material was hard, white with a fine foamed structure. The water content was 12%, as water was allowed to escape when the melt left the extruder nozzle.</p>
    <p>The obtained granulated material was then conditioned to a water content of 17%.</p>
    <p>(b) Preparation of destructurized starch granules of acid-washed potato starch.</p>
    <p>600 g of native potato starch were suspended in 700 cm<sup>3</sup> of 0.2 M HCl and stirred for 10 minutes. The suspension was filtered and the starch washed on the filter three times with 200 cm<sup>3</sup> portions of 0.2 M HCl. The starch was again suspended in 500 cm<sup>3</sup> 0.2 M HCl, stirred again for 10 minutes, filtered, washed three times with 200 cm<sup>3</sup> portions of 0.2 M HCl.</p>
    <p>After the treatment with HCl, the excess of acid was removed by washing on a filter with demineralized (deionized) water in the following way: the starch was washed twice with 200 cm<sup>3</sup> portions of deionized water and then suspended in 500 cm of deionized water. This washing procedure with deionized water (to remove excess acid) was repeated twice to get the starch free of HCl. This was controlled by adding silver nitrate to the washing water. When there was no more silver chloride precipitating in the washing water, the Washing was completed. The washed starch was pressed on the filter and dried in a conditioning room (25° C., 40% RH) until it equilibrated at about 17.0% H<sub>2</sub> O.</p>
    <p>Analyses have been carried out before and after the acid washing of starch for mono- and divalent ions and results obtained showed that the Ca<sup>+2</sup> -ions bridging the phosphate groups were essentially removed.</p>
    <p>(c) Injection molding of a mixture of destructurized starch and synthetic polymer.</p>
    <p>The granulates as obtained under (a) and the granules as obtained under (b) above were mixed with a synthetic polymer in the weight ratios as specified in Table (c-1)-1 below and injection molded to produce test pieces suitable for measuring their dimensional stability. The test pieces were injection molded using a Kloeckner FM60 injection molding machine at an injection molding temperature at the end of the barrel of 165° C. at a cycle time of about 15 seconds. The injection molding pressure was about 1600 bars and the back pressure about 75 bars.</p>
    <p>(d) Testing and testing conditions</p>
    <p>The test pieces were placed (laid on a screen) in a climatic cabinet in which a high relative humidity (near 100% R.H.) was maintained using a 1% aqueous sulfuric acid solution at room temperature. For each blend material 3 test pieces were used to obtain average figures relating to dimensional stability.</p>
    <p>The test pieces obtained from the mold, were cut to a length of about 87-90 mm, which is close to the optimal length which can be measured on a NIKON profile projector V12.</p>
    <p>After cutting the length, the samples were initially equilibrated to 14% H<sub>2</sub> O content, placed on the NIKON V12 and their widths and lengths were measured.</p>
    <p>The samples were then placed in the climatic cabinet and exposed to a high relative humidity at room temperature. Reference samples of unblended starch were placed under the same conditions. The dimensions were measured on each of the 3 pieces and recorded after 1, 2 and 3 days.</p>
    <p>The lengths measured are given in Table (c-1)-1.</p>
    <p>In width, slight expansions of up to 4% with 1% polymer content and less than 4% with 5% polymer, were generally observed.</p>
