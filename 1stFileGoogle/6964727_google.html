<heading>RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading> <p num="p-0002">Is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/946,917, filed Sep. 5, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,565,714, which claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 60/275,527 filed on Mar. 12, 2001.</p>
<heading>BACKGROUND</heading> <p num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
  <p num="p-0004">The present invention relates to a system and device for de-heading a vessel containing a fluid, distillates, or unconsolidated debris byproduct, such as the several types of coke. Specifically, the present invention relates to a system and device, namely a de-header valve, that is coupled to a coke drum, particularly at the top or bottom, which serves to safely and effectively de-head the coke drum following the manufacture of coke, or other byproducts, and to facilitate the removal of coke during the decoking process.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">2. Background</p>
  <p num="p-0006">In the hydrocarbon processing industry, many refineries recover valuable products from the heavy residual oil that remains after refining operations are completed. This recovery process is known as delayed coking and produces valuable distillates and coke in large vessels or coke drums. Coke drums are usually in operation in pairs so that when one coke drum is being filled with the byproduct or residual material, the feed may be directed to an empty drum so that the filled drum may be cooled and the byproduct purged from the coke drum, a process known as decoking. This allows the refinery process to operate in a continuous manner, without undue interruption.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">When one coke drum is full, it must be purged of the byproduct fed into it. The drum is steam purged and cooled with quench water. The drum is then drained of water and vented to atmospheric pressure, after which the top and bottom heads are removed (i.e. the coke drum is de-headed) to allow the coke to be cut from the drum and fall into a catch basin, typically a rail car. This process of de-heading the coke drum can be extremely dangerous for several reasons. To mention only a few, the cooling water introduced into the hot drums prior to the removal of the bottom head becomes extremely hot and could leak from the loosened head and scald surrounding operators, the load of un-drained water and loose coke within the drum may exceed the limits of the support system and cause heavy equipment to fall, positioning the chute and necessary removal of the flanges or heads is done with operators who are in close proximity to the drums, potentially falling coke may injure workers as the heads are removed, and operating personnel may be exposed to finely divided coke particles, steam, hot water and noxious gases, when the drum is opened. Indeed several fatalities occur each year as a result of this manufacturing process. Once the coke is removed, the heads are replaced and the coke drum is prepared to repeat the cycle.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">Prior art systems and methods have tired to more efficiently and effectively de-head coke drums, as well as to minimize many of the dangers inherent is the de-heading process. One such method involves placing a de-heading cart under the drum, raising a flange support ram, with braces installed, and loosening some (up to one half) of the flange bolts by manual operation with an impact wrench. Following the water quench and drain, the remaining bolts are manually removed, braces are removed from the ram, the approximately 4-ton flange is lowered, and the cart, with flange resting thereon, is moved away. This is extremely dangerous due to the manual labor requirements.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">Other systems have been disclosed, which somewhat reduce human or manual involvement. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,726,109 to Malsbury et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 4,960,358 to DiGiacomo et al. describe a remote unheading device for coking drums. The device includes a head unit for attachment to a lower flange of a coking drum and a plurality of swing bolts which are disconnected by remotely operated de-tensioning equipment. A platform device lowers the head unit, moves it laterally to one side and tips it for cleaning. A chute attached to the frame can be raised into engagement with the coking drum lower flange for removal of coke from the drum.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">U.S. Pat. No. 5,098,524 to Antalfy et al. filed on Dec. 10, 1990 discloses a coke drum unheading device having a pivoting actuator system operable from a location remote from a drum outlet. The actuator is adapted to move a drum head between closed and open positions and to retain the drum head in a closed position under a load.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,094 to Fruchtbaum provides a coke drum unheading device that retracts and tilts the bottom head incrementally so that falling debris such as shot coke can be caught by a chute. Following disposal of the loose debris, the head can be withdrawn from the area of the drum for maintenance. Specifically, the invention provides an unheading device for removing a bottom head from a flange on a lower end of a coke drum. An unheading car is horizontally movable into and from position below the bottom head. A vertically adjustable bottom head support member is mounted on the car. A bearing plate is pivotally mounted at an upper end of the support member for engaging a lower surface of the bottom head. A retractable arm has first and second sections hingedly connected at one end and having respective opposite ends secured to the bearing plate and the support member for pivoting the bearing plate and bottom head supported thereon with respect to horizontal, preferably to tilt the head towards an adjacent chute.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">U.S. Pat. No. 5,581,864 to Rabet discloses an apparatus and method enabling removal of the drum head of a coke drum, which comprises an apparatus remotely placing a carriage under the drum head and the carriage is adapted to remotely engage the drum head, tightly support the head against the drum while workers are in the area, and to lower the head and carry it away. A safety feature is also included and disclosed, wherein the carriage is normally supported by springs which, in the event of excessive loads, automatically transfers the load carrier to an overhead beam designed to carry any excessive loads.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">Each of these prior art devices share common deficiencies in that they are incapable of providing simple, efficient, and safe solutions to the de-heading of a coke drum. Specifically, each of the assemblies or devices require that the head unit be completely removed from the flange portion of the coke drum after each coking cycle and prior to the purging of the coke from the coke drum. This creates an extreme hazard to workers and provides an inefficient and time consuming procedure. Removal of the head unit increases the chance for accident, while at the same time increases human involvement as the head unit must be properly placed on the coke drum each time despite the automation involved. In addition, a large amount of floor space is required to accommodate those assemblies and devices that automate the removal and lifting of the head unit from the coke drum. Finally, such devices and systems may not be operable in an environment where there the bottom headroom is less than the diameter of the bottom head.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0014">In light of the problems and deficiencies inherent in prior art coke drum deheading systems and devices, the present invention seeks to provide a more efficient, cost-effective, and safe coke drum de-heading device and system.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">Therefore, it is an object of the preferred embodiments of the present invention to provide a simplified and reliable coke drum de-heading system that does not require the physical removal of the coke drum heads after each coking cycle, but rather comprises a mechanical de-header valve that accomplishes the equivalent de-heading function of prior art designs.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">It is another object of the preferred embodiments of the present invention to provide a coke drum de-heading system, wherein the de-header valve is removably coupled to the flanged portion of a coke drum and adapted to de-head the coke drum without having to be removed after each coking cycle.</p>
  <p num="p-0017">It is still another object of the preferred embodiments of the present invention to provide a coke drum de-heading system having a dual seated, linear motion blind.</p>
  <p num="p-0018">It is a further object of the preferred embodiments of the present invention to provide a coke drum de-heading system having a linear motion blind as the only major moving part.</p>
  <p num="p-0019">It is still a further object of the preferred embodiments of the present invention to provide a coke drum de-heading system that connects to the coke drum via a flanged bolted connection.</p>
  <p num="p-0020">It is still a further object of the preferred embodiments of the present invention to provide a coke drum de-heading system having dual independent seats that provide double block and bleed and double block and purge capabilities.</p>
  <p num="p-0021">It is still a further object of the preferred embodiments of the present invention to provide a coke drum de-heading system having metal to metal seating.</p>
  <p num="p-0022">A still further object of the preferred embodiments of the present invention is to provide one or more dynamic or live loaded seats energized from outside the process stream.</p>
  <p num="p-0023">A still further object of the preferred embodiments of the present invention is to provide a system design having remote verification of positive isolation.</p>
  <p num="p-0024">A still further object of the preferred embodiments of the present invention is to provide a system having instant and remote live switching to double block and vent mode from double block and purge mode upon loss of purge steam.</p>
  <p num="p-0025">To achieve the foregoing objects, and in accordance with the invention as embodied and broadly described herein, the present invention features a coke drum de-heading system that provides unique advantages over prior art de-heading systems, namely the de-heading of a coke drum without having to physically remove the head units. This is essentially accomplished using a specially designed de-header valve to be used in a de-header system.</p>
  <p num="p-0026">Specifically, the de-header system comprises a dual seated, linear motion goggle blind gate valve, or de-header valve, that is removably coupled to and seals against the flanged portion of a coke drum much the same way a conventional head unit would be attached. The de-header valve is equipped with a sliding blind having an orifice therein, a flat surface adjacent the orifice, a stroke slightly greater than the diameter of the orifice in the de-header valve, and upper and lower seats, wherein one of such seats is a dynamic, live loaded seat that is capable of adjustment so as to seal the blind between the upper and lower seats. As such, the sliding blind can be moved in a substantially linear bi-directional manner between upper and lower seats, or dual seats, thus causing the orifice located thereon to move between an open, closed, and partially open position relative to the orifice in the coke drum. In a closed position, the de-header valve and coke drum are prepared to receive the byproduct feed from the refinery process used to manufacture coke. Once the drum is full, the valve may be actuated causing the sliding blind to open. In doing so, coke that has accumulated on the blind is sheared by the upper and lower seats, thus de-heading the coke drum and facilitating the removal of coke using methods commonly known in the art. The critical aspect of the present invention is its ability to provide a simple, yet effective de-heading system comprising a de-header valve having a sliding blind that moves back and forth between dual independent seats to de-head a coke drum and simplify the decoking process. Another critical aspect of the present invention is the ability to de-head the coke drum without having to remove the head unit, and to do so at a remote location with little or no manual requirements.</p>
  <p num="p-0027">In a preferred embodiment, the present invention features a coke drum de-heading system comprising (a) at least one coke drum containing manufactured coke therein, wherein the coke drum has a top orifice and a bottom orifice; (b) a de-header valve removably coupled to the coke drum and designed to facilitate the removal of coke from the coke drum by de-heading the coke drum and allowing the coke to pass there through; and (c) an exchange system, including an upper and lower bonnet and other elements and members adapted to integrate the de-heading system, and particularly the de-header valve, into the manufacturing system. The de-header valve itself comprises (1) a main body having an orifice dimensioned to align, in a concentric relationship, with either the top or bottom orifice of the coke drum when the de-header valve is coupled thereto; (2) a live loaded seat assembly coupled to the main body and comprising a dynamic, live loaded seat, a live seat adjustment mechanism coupled to the main body and designed to control and adjust the force and resulting seat load of the dynamic, live loaded seat, and a force transfer module in juxtaposition to the dynamic, live loaded seat for transferring the force from the live loaded seat adjustment mechanism to the dynamic, live loaded seat; (3) a static seat positioned opposite from and counteracting or counterbalancing the dynamic, live loaded seat; and (4) a blind or sliding blind capable moving in a linear, bi-directional manner within the de-header valve and between the dynamic, live loaded seat and the static seat, the blind physically controlled by an actuator and having a force exerted thereon by the dual seats, namely the dynamic, live loaded seat and the static seat, such that a seal is created between the dynamic, live loaded seat, the blind, and the static seat. In essence, the de-header valve de-heads the coke drum and facilitates the removal of the coke from the coke drum upon actuation of the blind from a closed to an open position wherein the coke is sheared.</p>
  <p num="p-0028">The present invention further comprises a point to point sealing system comprising a plurality of loaded, independent, dual seats, preferably four, that seal directly against the gate. The seal consists of or is a result of the metal to metal seating between the upper and lower seats and the blind. Due to a dynamic, loaded upper seat, the amount of force required to properly seal the seats to the gate is accomplished using a live load seat adjustment mechanism designed to control the amount of force exerted on the blind.</p>
  <p num="p-0029">As a result, the present invention provides a new and improved coke drum de-heading system. The system also utilizes pressure valves and steam purge inlet valves, as well as emergency vent valves to monitor and control pressure within the system and to prevent inadvertent venting of the steam to atmosphere.</p>

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p num="p-0044">It will be readily understood that the components of the present invention, as generally described and illustrated in the figures herein, could be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configurations. Thus, the following more detailed description of the embodiments of the system, device, and method of the present invention, and represented in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 11</figref>, is not intended to limit the scope of the invention, as claimed, but is merely representative of the presently preferred embodiments of the invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0045">The presently preferred embodiments of the invention will be best understood by reference to the drawings wherein like parts are designated by like numerals throughout. Although reference to the drawings and a corresponding discussion follow below, it is first advantageous to provide a general background of the coking process, including the process of de-heading the coke drums at the end of a manufacturing cycle.</p>
  <heading>General Discussion on Delayed Coking and Coke De-Heading</heading> <p num="p-0046">In the typical delayed coking process, high boiling petroleum residues are fed to one or more coke drums where they are thermally cracked into light products and a solid residue—petroleum coke. The coke drums are typically large cylindrical vessels having a top head and a conical bottom portion fitted with a bottom head. The fundamental goal of coking is the thermal cracking of very high boiling point petroleum residues into lighter fuel fractions. Coke is a byproduct of the process. Delayed coking is an endothermic reaction with a furnace supplying the necessary heat to complete the coking reaction in a drum. The exact mechanism is very complex, and out of all the reactions that occur, only three distinct steps have been isolated: 1) partial vaporization and mild coking of the feed as it passes through the furnace; 2) cracking of the vapor as it passes through the coke drum; and 3) cracking and polymerization of the heavy liquid trapped in the drum until it is converted to vapor and coke. The process is extremely temperature-sensitive with the varying temperatures producing varying types of coke. For example, if the temperature is too low, the coking reaction does not proceed far enough and pitch or soft coke formation occurs. If the temperature is too high, the coke formed generally is very hard and difficult to remove from the drum with hydraulic decoking equipment. Higher temperatures also increase the risk of coking in the furnace tubes or the transfer line. As stated, delayed coking is a thermal cracking process used in petroleum refineries to upgrade and convert petroleum residuum (or resid) into liquid and gas product streams leaving behind a solid concentrated carbon material, or coke. A fired heater is used in the process to reach thermal cracking temperatures, which range upwards of 1,000° F. With short residence time in the furnace, coking of the feed material is thereby “delayed” until it reaches large coking drums downstream of the heater. In normal operations, there are two coke drums so that when one is being filled, the other may be purged of the manufactured coke. These coke drums are large structures that are approximately 25-30 meters in height and from 4 to 9 meters in diameter. They are equipped with a top blind flange closure or orifice that is typically about 1.5 meters in diameter, and a bottom blind flange orifice that is typically about 2 meters in diameter.</p>
  <p num="p-0047">In a typical petroleum refinery process, several different physical structures of petroleum coke may be produced. These are namely, shot coke, sponge coke, and/or needle coke, and are each distinguished by their physical structures and chemical properties. These physical structures and chemical properties also serve to determine the end use of the material. Several uses are available for manufactured coke, some of which include fuel for burning, the ability to be calcined for use in the aluminum, chemical, or steel industries, or the ability to be gasified to produce steam, electricity, or gas feedstock for the petrochemicals industry.</p>
  <p num="p-0048">To produce the coke, a delayed coker feed originates from the crude oil supplied to the refinery and travels through a series of process members and finally empties into one of the coke drums used to manufacture coke. A basic refinery flow diagram is presented as <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, with two coke drums shown. The delayed coking process is a batch-continuous process, which means that the process is ongoing or continuous as the feed stream coming from the furnace alternates filling between the two or more coke drums. As mentioned, while one drum is on-line filling up with coke, the other is being stripped, cooled, decoked, and prepared to receive another batch. This is a timely process, with each batch in the batch-continuous process taking approximately 12-20 hours to complete. In essence, hot oil, or resid as it is commonly referred to as, from the tube furnace is fed into one of the coke drums in the system. The oil is extremely hot and produces hot vapors that condense on the colder walls of the coke drum. As the drum is being filled, a large amount of liquid runs down the sides of the drum into a boiling turbulent pool at the bottom. As this process continues, the hot resid and the condensing vapors cause the coke drum walls to heat. This naturally in turn, causes the resid to produce less and less of the condensing vapors, which ultimately causes the liquid at the bottom of the coke drum to start to heat up to coking temperatures. After some time, a main channel is formed in the coke drum, and as time goes on, the liquid above the accumulated coke decreases and the liquid turns to a more viscous type tar. This tar keeps trying to run back down the main channel which can coke at the top, thus causing the channel to branch. This process progresses up through the coke drum until the drum is full, wherein the liquid pools slowly turn to solid coke. When the first coke drum is full, the hot oil feed is switched to the second coke drum, and the first coke drum is isolated, steamed to remove residual hydrocarbons, cooled by filling with water, opened, and then decoked. This cyclical process is repeated over and over again in the manufacture of coke.</p>
  <p num="p-0049">The decoking process is the process used to remove the coke from the drum upon completion of the coking process. Due to the shape of the coke drum, coke accumulates in the area near and attaches to the heads during the manufacturing process. To decoke the drum, the heads must first be removed. Typically, once full, the drum is vented to atmospheric pressure and the top head (typically a 4-foot diameter flange) is unbolted and removed to enable placement of a hydraulic coke cutting apparatus. After the cooling water is drained from the vessel, the bottom head (typically a 7-foot-diameter flange) is unbolted and removed. This process is commonly known as “de-heading” and can be a very dangerous procedure because of the size of the flanges, the high temperatures within the drum, potential falling coke, and other reasons as mentioned above. Once the heads are removed, the coke is removed from the drum by drilling a pilot hole from top to bottom of the coke bed using high pressure water jets. Following this, the main body of coke left in the coke drum is cut into fragments which fall out the bottom and into a collection bin, such as a bin on a rail cart, etc. The coke is then dewatered, crushed and sent to coke storage or loading facilities.</p>
  <heading>Present Invention Coke Drum De-heading System</heading> <p num="p-0050">Although the present invention is intended to cover both top and bottom de-heading systems, or rather the de-heading system of the present invention may be applicable and utilized on both the top and bottom openings of a coke drum, the following detailed description and preferred embodiments will be discussed in reference to a bottom de-heading system only. One ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize that the invention as explained and described herein for a coke drum bottom de-heading system may also be designed and used as a coke drum top de-heading system and the following discussion pertaining to the bottom de-heading system is not meant to be limiting to such.</p>
  <p num="p-0051">The present invention describes a method and system for de-heading a coke drum following the manufacture of coke therein. As the present invention is especially adapted to be used in the coking process, the following discussion will relate specifically in this manufacturing area. It is foreseeable however, that the present invention may be adapted to be an integral part of other manufacturing processes producing various elements other than coke, and such processes should thus be considered within the scope of this application.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">The present invention comprises a system comprising a dual seated, linear motion, goggle blind valve, or de-header valve.</p>
  <p num="p-0053"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts, generally, a petroleum manufacturing and refinery process <b>14</b> having several elements and systems present (identified, but not discussed). In addition to these elements, petroleum manufacturing and refinery process <b>14</b> includes first and second delayed coke drums <b>18</b> and <b>22</b>, respectively. As mentioned, there are typically two coke drums in simultaneous operation so as to permit the ongoing manufacture and refinery of petroleum as well as its coke byproduct. While first coke drum <b>18</b> is online and being filled via feed inlet <b>26</b>, second coke drum <b>22</b> is going through a decoking process to purge the manufactured coke contained therein. Thereafter, when first coke drum <b>18</b> has reached capacity, feed inlet <b>26</b> is switched to second coke drum <b>22</b> that has just previously been purged of its contents, whereby first coke drum <b>18</b> is primed for the decoking process where its contents will be purged. This process, commonly referred to as batch-continuous, allows the refinery to maintain continuous uninterrupted operation. Of course there may be only one coke drum or a plurality of coke drums present. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> also show the addition of coke drum de-heading system <b>10</b>, including de-header valve <b>12</b> and its place within the refinery process. Although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is illustrative of a petroleum manufacturing and refinery process having two coke drums in series, and although the discussion and preferred embodiments illustrated, described, and discussed herein focus on a coke drum de-heading system, one ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention may be applicable or adapted to a number of different processes in which a function similar to the coking process is present.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">In reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, a general front view of coke drum de-heading system <b>10</b> is shown, with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> showing system <b>10</b> attached or coupled to first coke drum <b>18</b>. In light of the identical nature and setup of coke drum de-heading systems <b>10</b> on first and second coke drums <b>18</b> and <b>22</b> respectively, only first,coke drum <b>18</b> will be discussed throughout the application. Specifically, coke drum de-heading system <b>10</b> is removably coupled to coke drum <b>18</b> to allow the system to be removed if necessary. As shown, coke drum de-heading system <b>10</b> comprises a de-header valve <b>12</b> having a body <b>46</b> and upper and lower seats, <b>34</b> and <b>38</b> respectively, attached thereto. Body <b>46</b> comprises a flanged portion <b>42</b> that consists of substantially the same dimensions as the corresponding opening, whether flanged or otherwise, of coke drum <b>18</b>. As shown, flanged portion <b>42</b> is coupled to flanged portion <b>30</b> on coke drum <b>18</b> using those means known in the art, which is typically a bolted flanged connection. Flanged portion <b>30</b> is a part of the “head” of coke drum <b>18</b>, depending upon the design of coke drum <b>18</b>, de-header valve <b>12</b> may be coupled to flanged portion <b>30</b> or directly to the body of coke drum <b>18</b>. The significance of the present invention, as opposed to prior art de-heading systems and devices, is that the coke drum de-heading system <b>10</b> of the present invention does not require the “head” of the coke drum to be removed each time the drum is to be decoked. This significance is discussed at greater length below. Various sealing members and agents are used to seal de-header valve <b>12</b> to coke drum <b>18</b> to prevent inadvertent leaking.</p>
  <p num="p-0055">Upper seat <b>34</b> and lower seat <b>38</b> are comprised of a dynamic, live loaded seat and a static seat, with the preferred configuration comprising a dynamic live loaded upper seat <b>34</b>, and a static lower seat <b>38</b>. An alternative embodiment may comprise a dynamic, live loaded lower seat and a static upper seat. In the preferred embodiment, the static seat is a one piece seat that is securely fastened to de-header valve <b>12</b> and is preferably non-adjustable. However, it is within the scope of this invention that both the upper and lower seats could be dynamic and/or adjustable, or that both the upper and lower seats could be static. In contrast to the static seat, dynamic, live loaded seat is a moveable and adjustable seat that is energized from without the process stream via live seat adjustment mechanism. The function of the dynamic, live loaded seat is to provide point to point fine tuning of the system, and particularly the blind as it is sealed between upper and lower seats <b>34</b> and <b>38</b>. Various sealing members, such as O-rings, may be used to seal the seats and their adjacent seat retainers to de-header valve <b>12</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0056"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> also depict upper bonnet <b>54</b> and lower bonnet <b>58</b> coupled to body <b>46</b> of de-header valve <b>12</b>. Upper bonnet <b>54</b> and lower bonnet <b>58</b> are removably coupled to body <b>46</b> using known means such as bolts <b>50</b> as shown. Upper bonnet <b>54</b> and lower bonnet <b>58</b> are shown having various elements thereon to operate within the refinery process. Upper bonnet <b>54</b> is shown equipped with steam purge outlet port <b>66</b> and an outlet steam trap and orifice assembly <b>70</b>. Upper bonnet also is shown having a pressure transmitter <b>74</b> and a pressure gauge <b>78</b>. Lower bonnet <b>58</b> is shown having a steam purge inlet port <b>82</b> and an inlet steam trap and orifice plate assembly <b>86</b> coupled thereto. Lower bonnet <b>58</b> also is shown having a vent valve assembly <b>90</b> and outlet pipe <b>94</b>. Vent valve assembly is located on a distal end of lower bonnet <b>58</b> and serves as an emergency release. Upon the introduction of a pressure into the system that is above the upper limit, emergency vent valve is activated, which releases pressure from the system and drains any excess fluid and gas through pipe <b>94</b>. Each of these additions are used to control and monitor the pressurized environment existing within the system. One ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize the needed applications and devices to maintain a suitable environment during the coking process.</p>
  <p num="p-0057">In addition to the features mentioned above, upper and lower bonnets <b>54</b> and <b>58</b>, respectively, are independent of one another, yet may be in communication with one another. For example, depending upon the system requirements and specifications, upper bonnet <b>54</b> may be pressurized and lower bonnet <b>58</b> may be purged to maintain system equilibrium requirements.</p>
  <p num="p-0058"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> are also illustrative of actuator <b>62</b> and ram <b>114</b>. Actuator <b>62</b> is used to drive ram <b>114</b>, which provides the actual physical control of the blind <b>106</b> (not shown) of de-header valve <b>12</b>. Actuator <b>62</b> and ram <b>114</b> provide the sliding lateral bi-directional movement to blind <b>106</b>, which is used to open and close de-header valve <b>12</b> as needed. A significant advantage to the present invention is the ability to virtually eliminate human or manual involvement or presence during the manufacturing process. For example, due to the design and functionality of de-header valve <b>12</b> actuator <b>62</b> may be controlled or actuated from a location remote from the actual site of the coke drums. As actuator <b>62</b> is a hydraulic pump in a preferred embodiment, it is not necessary to actually activate actuator <b>62</b> at the site. Rather, any known means in the art may be used to control actuator <b>62</b> a safe distance away from the coke drums. As a result, the safety and ease of operation provide an advantage not found in prior art designs. Actuator <b>62</b> and ram <b>114</b> are each discussed in greater detail below in accordance with their corresponding figure(s).</p>
  <p num="p-0059"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a top view of coke drum de-heading system <b>10</b>. Specifically, de-header valve <b>12</b> comprises a body <b>46</b> having an orifice <b>98</b> surrounded by a flanged portion <b>42</b> used to couple the de-header valve <b>12</b> to coke drum <b>18</b>. Also shown is upper seat <b>34</b>, which is a dynamic, live loaded seat contained within flanged portion <b>42</b>. Although not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, de-header valve <b>12</b> comprises a lower static seat <b>38</b>. Upper seat <b>34</b> and lower seat <b>38</b> serve to balance or support blind <b>106</b> as it moves or slides in a bi-directional manner through de-header valve <b>12</b>. Blind <b>106</b> is shown in</p>
  <p num="p-0060"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> as comprising a flat surface <b>108</b> and an orifice <b>110</b> adjacent flat surface <b>108</b>. Essentially, blind <b>106</b> moves laterally within coke drum de-heading system <b>10</b> to open and close de-header valve <b>12</b>. In a closed position, blind <b>106</b> is actuated and slid between upper seat <b>34</b> and lower seat <b>38</b>, such that flat surface <b>108</b> completely blocks the opening in coke drum <b>18</b>. In this closed position, coke drum <b>18</b> is ready to receive inlet feed <b>26</b>, wherein coke drum <b>18</b> is filled with the petroleum byproduct, or resid, used to manufacture coke. Blind <b>106</b> is a dual seated blind, meaning that it is supported on either side from opposing or counteracting upper and lower seats <b>34</b> and <b>38</b>, respectively. In addition, since upper seat <b>34</b> (or lower seat <b>38</b> in an alternative embodiment) is a dynamic, live loaded seat having adjustable properties, blind <b>106</b> is a “floating” blind in the sense that it is biased as a result of the biased nature of dynamic, live loaded upper seat <b>34</b>. When the device comprises static seat <b>34</b> and static seat <b>38</b>, blind <b>106</b> moves within the tolerances between the space static seat <b>34</b> and static seat <b>38</b> and the height or thickness of blind <b>106</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">Upon actuation of actuator <b>62</b> and ram <b>114</b> coupled thereto and to blind <b>106</b>, blind <b>106</b> is caused to slide substantially laterally in a bi-directional manner between upper seat <b>34</b> and lower seat <b>38</b> into an open or partially open position, such that orifice <b>110</b> is brought into alignment with orifice <b>98</b> of de-header valve <b>12</b>, which in turn causes alignment with the opening in coke drum <b>18</b>. In this position, coke drum <b>18</b> may be decoked, or purged of its contents in traditional known methods. As such, flat surface <b>108</b> of blind <b>106</b> is retracted out of the way as blind <b>106</b> is slid in a substantially lateral manner in order to bring orifice <b>110</b> into proper alignment. Therefore, by sliding blind <b>106</b> back and forth, de-header valve <b>12</b> is opened and closed as needed. Blind <b>106</b> may be said to comprise a stroke having a distance long enough, such that blind <b>106</b> may close and seal de-header valve <b>12</b> using flat surface <b>108</b>, and open de-header valve <b>12</b> when orifice <b>110</b> is properly aligned with orifice <b>98</b> and the opening in coke drum <b>18</b>. The interim stages when blind <b>106</b> is moving from a closed position to an open position represents a critical aspect of the present invention as it is during these stages that the coke drum de-heading system performs the process of “de-heading” or “unheading” coke drum <b>18</b> in a significantly more effective and safe manner than prior art designs.</p>
  <p num="p-0062"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is illustrative of a cut away view of de-header valve <b>12</b>, and particularly the relationship between de-header valve <b>12</b>, having blind <b>106</b>, and coke drum <b>18</b>. Actuator <b>62</b> (not shown) controls ram <b>114</b>, which couples to blind <b>106</b> via attachment means <b>116</b>. Actuator <b>62</b> is preferably a hydraulic pump capable of producing the required forces to slide blind <b>106</b> in its substantially lateral manner within de-heading system <b>10</b>. As discussed, blind <b>106</b> is supported on either side by upper seat <b>34</b> and lower seat <b>38</b>. As a result, and due to the nature of the coke manufacturing process in which the system is under extreme temperature and pressure, a large force must be applied to blind <b>106</b> from upper and lower seats <b>34</b> and <b>38</b>, such that the system is substantially sealed and the pressure within the system maintained. Due to the existence of a dynamic, live loaded seat de-header valve <b>12</b>, and particularly the dynamic, live loaded seat, is capable of modulating any bowing in blind <b>106</b> that may exist during the coking process. The same effect can be accomplished using a dual static set configuration. In a normal coking process, extreme temperatures and pressures are present. Any variation in temperature between the upper and lower surfaces of the blind can cause the blind to bow. If the bowing is allowed to progress or continue, there is a danger in breaking the seal created between upper and lower seats <b>34</b> sand <b>38</b> and blind <b>106</b>, which could cause damage to the system and upset the manufacturing process. However, the ability of the present invention to adjust the load exerted on blind <b>106</b>, utilizing the dynamic, live loaded seat and its adjustment mechanism, or sealing between seat <b>34</b> and <b>38</b>, provides a way to prevent, compensate for or modulate any existing bowing that might occur. By increasing the applied load of the dynamic, live loaded seat on blind <b>106</b>, the bowing is substantially eliminated, thus returning blind <b>106</b> to a more natural shape.</p>
  <p num="p-0063">In order to move blind <b>106</b>, actuator <b>62</b> must be comprised of sufficient strength so as to be able to overcome this initial seal and provide the necessary force to slide blind <b>106</b> back and forth between an open and closed position. One ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize that other types of devices or systems may be used, other than a hydraulic pump, to actuate blind <b>106</b> and to overcome the forces exerted on blind <b>106</b> by upper seat <b>34</b> and lower seat <b>38</b>, thus this should not be limiting in any way.</p>
  <p num="p-0064"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates coke drum <b>18</b> coupled to and sealed to de-header valve <b>12</b>. Specifically, the flanged portions of each are coupled together using commonly known means, such as a bolted connection. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is primarily used to illustrate blind <b>106</b>, having orifice <b>110</b> and flat surface <b>108</b>, and its service in de-heading coke drum <b>18</b>. De-header valve <b>12</b> is shown in a partially open position. In a closed position, flat surface <b>108</b> would align with orifice <b>98</b> and the opening of coke drum <b>18</b>, such that the system, and particularly coke drum <b>18</b>, would be ready to receive feed inlet <b>26</b>. Blind <b>106</b> has an end portion that settles into a blind shroud <b>122</b> when de-header valve <b>12</b> is closed.</p>
  <p num="p-0065">Coke drum <b>18</b> is also cut away to show the presence of coke <b>4</b> therein, and particularly coke head <b>6</b> and its relative position within system <b>10</b>. During the manufacturing process, resid is pumped into coke drum <b>18</b>, thereby ultimately producing coke <b>4</b> that is contained within coke drum <b>18</b>. In the beginning stages when coke drum <b>18</b> is being filled with resid, a large portion will naturally accumulate at the bottom of the drum and on flat surface <b>108</b>, thus forming a “head” near the opening of de-header valve <b>12</b>. This accumulation causes flat surface <b>108</b> of blind <b>106</b> to be caked with coke. As the resid sets up and coke is formed, this “head” must be removed in order to decoke the entire drum and purge the drum of the coke bed contained therein. This is essentially done by the present invention by sliding blind <b>106</b> from a closed position to an open position. As can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, blind <b>106</b> is supported by upper and lower seats <b>34</b> and <b>38</b>. Not only is blind <b>106</b> supported, but rather large forces are applied to blind <b>106</b> through these seats in order to enable a suitable pressurized environment. As such, the tolerances between upper and lower seats <b>34</b> and <b>38</b> and blind <b>106</b> are extremely tight. Because of these tight tolerances, and the accumulation of coke <b>4</b> on flat surface <b>108</b>, as blind <b>106</b> is displaced from its closed position, coke <b>4</b>, and particularly coke head <b>6</b>, is sheared by upper seat <b>34</b> from off of flat surface <b>108</b>. This shearing effect breaks up the coke that has accumulated on blind <b>106</b>, thus essentially de-heading coke drum <b>18</b>, wherein coke drum <b>18</b> is prepared for the decoking process.</p>
  <p num="p-0066">As a result of the load exerted upon blind <b>106</b> and resulting tight tolerances existing between blind <b>106</b> and upper and lower seats <b>34</b> and <b>38</b>, the substantially lateral bi-directional movement of blind <b>106</b> between upper and lower seats <b>34</b> and <b>38</b> causes a grinding and polishing effect to occur. In a preferred embodiment, upper and lower seats <b>34</b> and <b>38</b>, as well as blind <b>106</b> are made of metal, thus providing a metal to metal contact or metal to metal seal, or otherwise referred to as metal to metal seating of blind <b>106</b>. This metal to metal seating is a unique aspect of the present invention in relation to coke drum de-heading. The metal to metal seating increases the durability of the system as there are no non-metal parts, such as vinyl or rubber, used to seal the seats to blind <b>106</b>. Metal to metal seating allows the system to achieve a higher consistency of sealing, while at the same time providing extended wear and durability. In addition, the metal to metal scaling allows the system, and specifically the sealing within the system, to be fine-tuned as discussed below.</p>
  <p num="p-0067">Upper seat <b>34</b> and lower seat <b>38</b> are independent of one another and provide definitive double block and bleed/double block and purge capabilities.</p>
  <p num="p-0068">A further feature of the present invention is the enclosure of the seating used to seal the system. Upper seat <b>34</b> and lower seat <b>38</b> are completely protected from the flow of material passing through orifice <b>98</b>, such that they are not in the direct line of flow. As such, there is a decreased chance of erosion to the finish of upper and lower seats <b>34</b> and <b>38</b>, as well as decreased erosion potential. This becomes critical in that the present invention allows for fine-tuning of upper and lower seats <b>34</b> and <b>38</b> to more directly and precisely control sealing on a point to point basis against blind <b>106</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0069">As a result of this type of seating, the metal to metal contact coupled with the lateral bi-directional movement of blind <b>106</b> and the tight tolerances existing therein effectuates this polishing. This polishing effect over time provides for much smoother transitions of blind <b>106</b> between an open and closed position. In other words, the force required to displace blind <b>106</b> becomes less and less over time due to the smooth, polished metal to metal contact between upper and lower seats <b>34</b> and <b>38</b> and blind <b>106</b>. In addition to the metal to metal contact, upper and lower seats <b>34</b> and <b>38</b> may be finished, such as with a hardened chrome. Blind <b>106</b> may also be finished, such as with a nitride coating that is integrated into the molecular structure of blind <b>106</b>. Providing a finish to these elements creates significant advantages, such as increased wear, thus prolonging their replacement, and increasing performance while in operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0070"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> show de-header valve <b>12</b>, and particularly blind <b>106</b>, as it progresses from a substantially closed position (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) to a substantially open position (FIG. <b>7</b>), thus representing the interim stages when blind <b>106</b> is being slide laterally and coke drum <b>18</b> is essentially “de-headed.” As blind <b>106</b> is closed, coke <b>4</b> accumulates on flat surface <b>108</b> of blind <b>106</b>, such that blind <b>106</b> is caked with coke. Once coke drum <b>18</b> is full, feed inlet <b>26</b> is switched off or routed to a second coke drum. After the pre-coking steps are performed, the coke drum must be de-headed in order to allow the rest of the coke bed contained within the drum to be removed using standard procedures. To de-head coke drum <b>18</b>, an operator simply actuates actuator <b>62</b> from some location remote from the coking site, thus causing blind <b>106</b> to begin to move laterally in a bi-directional manner within de-header valve <b>12</b>. As actuator <b>62</b> is initially activated, a large force is required to move blind <b>106</b> due to the seal between blind <b>106</b> and upper and lower seats <b>34</b> and <b>38</b> that must be broken and the initial shearing of coke <b>4</b> that has accumulated on flat surface <b>108</b> of blind <b>106</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows how coke <b>4</b> begins to break free and build up along the inside edge of upper seat <b>34</b> as blind <b>106</b> is displaced. As blind <b>106</b> is displaced further, more coke <b>4</b> is freed and builds up. In addition, as orifice <b>110</b> is brought into alignment, that portion of coke <b>4</b> that has broken free is allowed to drop through orifice <b>98</b> of de-header valve <b>12</b> into catch basin <b>166</b>. Catch basin <b>166</b> may be any known device or system known in the art, such as a rail cart, etc.</p>
  <p num="p-0071"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows blind <b>106</b> in a more partially opened position. As can be seen, coke <b>4</b>, and particularly coke head <b>6</b>, is sheared from flat surface <b>108</b> of blind <b>106</b> the more blind <b>106</b> is opened. The lateral displacement of blind <b>106</b> from a closed to an opened position serves to de-head coke drum <b>18</b>. The tight tolerance between upper and lower seats <b>34</b> and <b>38</b> and blind <b>106</b> are such that coke <b>4</b> is not allowed to pass under upper seat <b>34</b>, but is sheared off and contained within the seat boundaries. Coke <b>4</b> should not pass under upper seat <b>34</b> as blind <b>106</b> is being opened as this would damage the polished surfaces being attained by the bi-directional movement of blind <b>106</b> between upper and lower seats <b>34</b> and <b>38</b>. Once opened, de-header valve <b>12</b> is not required to be removed from coke drum <b>18</b> prior to decoking the entire drum. Essentially, workers may decoke coke drum <b>18</b> using standard procedures. Once finished, the operator simply deactivates actuator <b>62</b>, such that blind <b>106</b> returns to a closed position, whereby coke drum <b>18</b> may again be filled with resid and put through the identical process. A great advantage of the present invention, among others, is that there is only one main moving part (blind <b>106</b>) used to de-head the coke drum and that this part is entirely enclosed within a valve that may be attached to the coke drum without having to be removed after each consecutive cycle.</p>
  <p num="p-0072"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-11</figref> represent the live loaded seat concept as applied to the coke drum de-heading system <b>10</b>, and specifically the de-header valve <b>12</b>, of the present invention. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates de-header valve <b>12</b> having a live loaded seat assembly <b>132</b> and a static seat assembly <b>136</b>. Live loaded seat assembly <b>132</b> is comprised of a dynamic live loaded seat, shown as upper seat <b>34</b>, and a live seat adjustment mechanism <b>134</b> used to adjust and control the load exerted by the dynamic live loaded seat upon flat surface <b>108</b> of blind <b>106</b>. Live loaded seat assembly <b>132</b> further comprises a force transfer module <b>162</b>, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> as a wedged member, whose primary purpose is to transfer the load exerted by live seat adjustment mechanism <b>134</b> to the dynamic live loaded seat, which in turn exerts a resulting force upon flat surface <b>108</b> of blind <b>106</b>. Force transfer module <b>162</b>, or wedged member, is constructed having an angled section, which corresponds directly with a matching angled portion on the dynamic, live loaded seat.</p>
  <p num="p-0073"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> also shows seat retaining rings <b>126</b>, whose function is to secure and hold upper seat <b>34</b> in place within de-header valve <b>12</b>. Seat retaining rings <b>126</b> are securely coupled to de-header valve <b>12</b>, using any number and orientation as necessary. Seat retaining rings <b>126</b> must be securely fastened so as to remain in a fixed position at all times. As shown, upper seat <b>34</b> exists as the dynamic live loaded seat described herein. Lower seat <b>38</b>, which is shown as a static seat, also is secured and held in place by a lower seat retaining ring similar to that as an upper seat retaining ring. Each of the seat retaining rings used in de-header valve <b>12</b> are coupled to de-header valve <b>12</b> using fastening means <b>130</b>, which are commonly known in the art.</p>
  <p num="p-0074"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> also provides an illustrative view of blind <b>106</b> and its relationship with upper seat <b>34</b> and lower seat <b>38</b>. In essence, blind <b>106</b> comprises a dual-seated linear motion blind having near zero tolerances existing between each of the upper and lower seats and the upper and lower surfaces of blind <b>106</b>. Such tolerances are necessary to maintain a suitable pressurized environment during the manufacturing process. As mentioned above, upper and lower seats <b>34</b> and <b>38</b> provide a metal to metal contact with blind <b>106</b> such that a seal is created within de-header valve <b>12</b>. This seal is important as there is a greater load between the seat and the gate, than the load in coke drum <b>18</b>. This seal enables de-header valve <b>12</b> to maintain a suitable pressurized environment during the coke manufacturing process and is attained by the load exerted on blind <b>106</b> through dynamic live-loaded seat <b>34</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0075"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates an enlarged view of live-loaded seat assembly <b>132</b> as shown in FIG. <b>8</b>. Live-loaded seat assembly <b>132</b> comprises live seat adjustment mechanism <b>134</b>, force transfer module <b>162</b>, and a dynamic live-loaded seat, which is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> as upper seat <b>34</b>. Each of these elements works in conjunction with one another to apply and transfer force to blind <b>106</b>, thus creating the necessary seal and de-heading function as earlier described. Live seat adjustment mechanism <b>134</b> itself comprises housing <b>138</b>, which houses and holds the elements of live seat adjustment mechanism <b>134</b>. Specifically, housing <b>138</b> has contained therein a force applicator <b>142</b> that may be manually adjusted depending on the amount and degree of force needed. In a preferred embodiment as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, force applicator <b>142</b> is simply a threaded member that may be rotated to increase or decrease the load on blind <b>106</b>. Force applicator <b>142</b> is adjacent to and in contact with biased plunger <b>146</b>. Biased plunger <b>146</b> has distal and proximate ends with the distal end being in direct contact with force transfer module <b>162</b>. As force applicator <b>142</b> is activated to increase or decrease the load exerted on blind <b>106</b>, biased plunger <b>147</b> is driven into force transfer module <b>162</b>, which in turn exerts a resulting force on the dynamic live-loaded seat, or upper seat <b>34</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, which in turn causes a resulting force to be exerted upon blind <b>106</b> at contact <b>36</b>. As mentioned, seat retaining rings <b>126</b> are securely fixed and will not move, thus allowing wedged portion (force transfer module <b>162</b>), which abuts seat retaining ring <b>126</b>, to transfer force directly to blind <b>106</b> through the dynamic, live loaded seat. The force applied by dynamic, live loaded seat to blind <b>106</b> is directly proportional to the force applied by force applicator <b>142</b>. Thus, to increase the load on blind <b>106</b>, the operator simply activates force applicator <b>142</b>. To decrease the load on blind <b>106</b>, the operator simply deactivates force applicator <b>142</b> as force applicator <b>142</b> is coupled to de-header valve <b>12</b> such that it may be cycled in and out to adjust the pressure or force exerted on blind <b>106</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0076">Force applicator <b>142</b> may be adjustable via manual means, such as a threaded bolt as shown, or via hydraulic or pneumatic means. One ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize the possible ways to apply pressure to force transfer module <b>162</b>, while maintaining a seal. In addition, load bearing members may also be comprised of any suitable means capable of bearing a biased load and creating a loaded tension force upon force transfer module <b>162</b> and the dynamic, live loaded seat.</p>
  <p num="p-0077">The dynamic live-loaded seat of the present invention is a biased seat, thus allowing a degree of longitudinal fluctuation of blind <b>106</b> both during the manufacturing process when coke drum <b>18</b> is being filled, as well as when actuator <b>62</b> is activated or deactivated to cause blind <b>106</b> to move from a closed position to an open position. This degree of longitudinal motion results in blind <b>106</b> moving in a substantially lateral manner. The biasing effects of the dynamic live-loaded seat results from the configuration of live seat adjustment mechanism <b>134</b>. Specifically, live seat adjustment mechanism <b>134</b> comprises a series of biasing elements or load bearing members <b>150</b>, such as belevue washers and springs <b>154</b> that act in conjunction with plunger <b>146</b>. By biasing the dynamic live-loaded seat, any physical variations or deflections in blind <b>106</b> during the manufacturing process or the de-coking process will be absorbed through live-loaded seat assembly <b>132</b>. This provides a significant advantage as it is not uncommon for blind <b>106</b> to go through various stages of deflection as a result of either pressure and/or temperature differentials. The biased nature of the dynamic live-loaded seat will allow de-header valve <b>12</b> to maintain a workable pressurized environment as well as to account for any physical or structural changes to de-header valve <b>12</b> as a result of the intense environment existing in the manufacturing process.</p>
  <p num="p-0078">Although not shown, the present invention of the dynamic seating configuration utilizes four independent sets of dynamic seats such that point to point adjustability is created within four loading zones. These four loading zones significantly increase the ability to adjust and manipulate the de-heading system according to the pressure within the system and the potential locations for leaking. They also allow the use of components that need not be as true or smooth as those used with static seals. The four sets of dynamic seats could even be adjusted to the point wherein an amount of force is applied to the blind such that it is no longer moveable by the actuator. By allowing point to point adjustability, the system is capable of being fine tuned to decrease the chances of unwanted leaks within the system. For example, if the system were leaking at one location, any one of, or multiple, dynamic seats could be adjusted to compensate and seal the leak. The four points are located at approximately equidistant locations about flange <b>42</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0079"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is illustrative of an alternative embodiment of live-loaded seat assembly <b>132</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0080">In addition to the above-described and illustrated features, the system of the present invention functions to control pressure within the system and to prevent leakage into unwanted areas of the system, thus providing for positive isolation. This isolation is accomplished through the use of close tolerances in the metal to metal seating, and resulting sealing. O-rings may also used to improve sealing. In addition, a positive pressure may be introduced from the outside of the valve to prevent venting of the feed stream to atmosphere or into parts of the valve. The system provides for remote verification of positive isolation. This means that steam maybe added to the steam purge inlet to pressurize the valve system outside of the sealed area. This pressure may be used to isolate the feed stream which is at a lower pressure, or it may be used to check the efficiency of the seals. The system is designed to allow remote monitoring of this isolation pressure to verify that the system is not leaking contaminants to atmosphere.</p>
  <p num="p-0081">The system, and specifically the dual independent seats, also provides definitive double block and bleed/purge capabilities as well as instant and remote live switching to double block and vent mode from double block and purge mode on loss of purge steam. The metal to metal seal between the gate and the upper and lower seats provide one method of blocking leakage, along with the pressure from the outside of the seals which isolates the feed stream if the pressure is greater outside of the seal. If pressure is leaking, the system may be adjusted using the dual seats as described above to compensate or o-rings may be replaced.</p>
  <p num="p-0082">The present invention also features a method for de-heading a coke drum following the manufacture of coke therein. The method comprises the steps of: (a) obtaining at least one coke drum designed for the manufacture of coke; (b) equipping the coke drum with a de-header valve, the de-header valve being removably coupled to the coke drum and itself comprising 1) a main body having means for connecting the de-header valve to the coke drum; 2) a first seat coupled to the main body; 3) a second seat coupled to the main body in an opposite or counteracting position to the first seat; and 4) a blind coupled to the main body and activated by an actuator, wherein the blind is capable of moving in a substantially lateral bi-directional manner within the de-header valve between the upper and lower seats to control the opening and closing of the de-header valve, and the blind providing a seal between the first loaded seat and the static seat; (c) closing the blind and sealing the first seat against the blind so as to seal the de-header valve; (d) manufacturing coke from a refinery process; and (e) de-heading the coke drum by actuating the blind and causing it to slide across the first seat and second seat into an open position, the first seat and second seat thus shearing the coke in the coke drum as the blind is displaced. This method may be utilized on either a bottom or top de-heading system.</p>
  <p num="p-0083">The present invention also contemplates different configuration of blind <b>106</b>. For example, blind <b>106</b> could be configured as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-14</figref>, or FIG. <b>13</b>. In either embodiment, the opening and closing of drum <b>18</b> are still provided. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, blind <b>106</b> is simply shorter and lacks any opening <b>110</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, blind <b>106</b> comprises a recessed end. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, blind <b>106</b> comprises a rounded end. Alternatively, blind <b>106</b> could be rounded as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> <i>a. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0084">The present invention also contemplates employing an actuator <b>62</b> that provides lateral force to two de-heading assemblies at the same time such that when one de-heading system is closes, the other is open, is illustrated schematically in FIG. <b>16</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0085">The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit of essential characteristics. The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only al illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims, rather than by the foregoing description.
