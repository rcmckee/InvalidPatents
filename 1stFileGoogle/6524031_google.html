    <heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading> <p>The present invention is a continuation application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/350,948, filed Jul. 9, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,305,880 , which is a continuation-in-part application, based upon and claiming priority to pending International Patent Application Ser. No. PCT/US98/00266, filed Jan. 9, 1998 by the inventors hereof, which application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/035,174, filed Jan. 9, 1997 by the inventors hereto to which priority is claimed.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>The present invention relates generally to devices and methods for the trenchless replacement of underground pipes and more particularly to pipe splitting devices and cable pulling devices and methods for splitting and expanding existing pipe to facilitate the replacement thereof with new pipe.</p>
    <p>2 . Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p>Trenchless technology for the replacement of underground pipe is not new, and the standard equipment and methods generally used are well known. This standard equipment for this technology is very large, heavy, and therefore requires additional large, heavy duty equipment for the transportation to, and the placement thereof on site, and the operation thereof on site.</p>
    <p>There are several methods of propelling a pipe bursting, and/or cracking and expanding device, and pulling a new pipe through an existing pipe. The most commonly used methods are large cable winches, and/or rod pushers or pullers that are usually hydraulically powered, and often used with a pneumatic percussive device helping to drive the pipe breaking device. Winches give continuous motion during pulling, while rod pushers/pullers generally give cycled motion in which they pull, then a rod must be either added or removed, before the return stroke, and next pull stroke. Sometimes rod pushers are converted to cable pullers, eliminating the need for rod removal.</p>
    <p>Winches and rod pushers/pullers that can produce pulling forces of up to 75 tons can themselves weigh 2 to 5 tons and must be handled and placed in position to pull; they are powered by correspondingly heavy duty equipment, cranes, trucks, and back-hoes, etc. They also need large excavations, such that the support equipment can take up enough room so as to create traffic problems and even require street closures.</p>
    <p>This also means that only large companies with large financial resources can afford the equipment necessary to replace underground pipes, and because the costs and maintenance on this equipment can be high, their prices are also high. Therefore the use of this prior art trenchless technology has been limited mainly to the 6 inch or above size pipe of municipal or corporate supply and sewer lines, and is used mainly by large contractors.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The basic components of the invention include a pipe parting mole, a length of cable that is engagable to the mole, a cable pulling device and a cable pulling device engagement means that provides a mounting structure for the cable pulling device. The cable pulling device engagement means generally includes a reaction plate and a structure for removably engaging the cable pulling device therewithin. A cable pulling frame may be advantageously used to facilitate the removal of the cable from a relatively small hole that is created at the pulling end of the pipe.</p>
    <p>The equipment of this invention, is of modular design and needs no bolting, or tools to assemble. It will fit into an excavation hole that is 2 feet wide and 3.5 feet long, for the small pullers (24 tons) and 2′×4.5 feet long for the largest puller (75+ tons) the entrance hole for the replacement pipe need be only as long as the radius bend, that the polyethylene pipe size used, requires.</p>
    <p>The components of the present invention can be easily built in several sizes according to the strength of the cable to be pulled, and componentized, so that no component weighs more than 75 lbs. One may can now move all the equipment necessary to pull up to 150,000 pounds (75 tons), in one average sized pick-up truck and hand carry it to remote areas normally inaccessible to the larger prior art equipment. The present invention has particular applications in the vast 4″ diameter home lateral pipe field, which has, up to now been relatively untouched by the trenchless method of pipe replacement.</p>
    <p>These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be well understood by those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment.</p>

    <p>A light weight cable pulling system, generally designated <b>80</b>, is disposed within the second hole <b>32</b> proximate the second end <b>36</b> of the pipe <b>14</b>. The preferred cable pulling system <b>80</b> includes a cable pulling frame member <b>84</b> having leg members <b>88</b> and a rotatable cable pulley <b>92</b> mounted thereto. A frame bracing reaction plate <b>96</b> is positioned against the side wall <b>100</b> of the hole <b>32</b> to provide a strong, firm surface for reactive cable pulling forces, as described herebelow. The reaction plate <b>96</b> is formed with a cable passage slot <b>104</b> (not shown in FIG. 1) for passage of the cable <b>70</b> therethrough. The cable <b>70</b> therefore passes through the plate slot <b>104</b> and around the cable pulley <b>92</b> to a cable pulling device <b>120</b> that is next described.</p>
    <p>The cable pulling device <b>120</b> is removably mounted to a generally cylindrical, slotted mounting socket or annulus <b>124</b> that is fixedly engaged to the frame <b>84</b>. The cable pulling device <b>20</b> is preferably a hydraulic device which is operated utilizing a portable hydraulic pump <b>128</b> having hydraulic lines <b>132</b> leading therefrom to the cable pulling device <b>120</b>. The cable pulling device <b>120</b> includes a cable pulling collet which releasably engages the cable for repeatable short pulling strokes. End portions of the cable <b>70</b> may be disposed in a coil <b>140</b> upon the ground surface <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p>It is therefore to be understood that an operator <b>150</b>, having engaged the cable <b>70</b> to the mole <b>40</b>, will pass the cable through the plate slot <b>104</b>, around the pulley <b>92</b> into the slotted annulus <b>124</b> and into operative engagement within the cable puller <b>120</b> that is mounted in the socket <b>124</b>. Thereafter, the operator <b>150</b> will activate the pump <b>128</b> and then activate the cable puller <b>120</b> to complete a first cable pulling stroke of perhaps 3 to 6 inches depending upon the travel of the hydraulic pulling device <b>120</b>, as is discussed in greater detail herebelow. Repeated pulling strokes of the puller <b>120</b> ultimately pulls the mole <b>40</b> entirely through the pipe <b>14</b>, until the mole <b>40</b> protrudes past the second end <b>36</b> of the pipe <b>14</b>, whereupon the replacement pipe <b>60</b> has been pulled entirely through the parted, expanded pipe <b>14</b>, in operational replacement thereof. The mole <b>40</b> is then disengaged from the replacement pipe <b>60</b>. The cable pulling system <b>80</b> is then removed from the hole <b>32</b>, appropriate pipe fixturing and jointing is accomplished at both ends of the replacement pipe, and the holes <b>24</b> and <b>32</b> can then be refilled.</p>
    <p>It is therefore to be understood that the modular, light weight, pipe replacement system of the present invention allows a single worker to easily take all steps necessary to accomplish the replacement of a length of buried, pre-existing pipe. The various components of the system, the mole <b>40</b>, the replacement pipe <b>60</b>, the cable <b>70</b>, the plate <b>96</b>, the frame <b>92</b>, the cable pulling device <b>120</b> and the pump <b>128</b> are all compact, light weight components that can be easily transported in a light duty pickup truck, and hand carried to, placed and assembled into the pulling hole by one man.</p>
    <p>A first preferred mole of the present invention is depicted in FIGS. 2 and 3, wherein FIG. 2 is a side elevational view and FIG. 3 is an end view taken from the nose <b>48</b> of the mole <b>40</b>. Components of the mole previously identified are numbered identically. As depicted in FIGS. 2 and 3, the mole <b>40</b> includes a generally tapered nose portion <b>48</b>, having a cable engagement bore <b>136</b> formed therethrough. The mole <b>40</b> further includes a generally cylindrical center portion <b>140</b>, the tapered body portion <b>44</b>, and the rear portion <b>64</b> which includes an integrally formed, rearwardly projecting cylindrical replacement pipe attachment shoulder <b>148</b>. As is best seen in FIG. 2, the end <b>152</b> of the length of replacement pipe <b>60</b> fits over the shoulder <b>148</b> and a cylindrical pipe retaining sleeve <b>156</b> is placed outside of the pipe end <b>152</b>. A plurality of pipe engagement screws <b>160</b> which project through the sleeve <b>156</b> and through holes formed in the end <b>152</b> of the pipe <b>60</b>, are threadably engaged within the rearwardly projecting shoulder <b>148</b>. Through use of the sleeve <b>156</b> and screws <b>160</b>, the end <b>152</b> of the pipe <b>60</b> is removably engaged to the rearward portion <b>64</b> of the mole <b>40</b>. A bore <b>164</b> is preferably formed within the rearward end <b>64</b> of the mole <b>40</b>. The bore <b>164</b> has inwardly tapered sidewalls <b>168</b> for a mating engagement with a tapered forward end of a standard impact driver (not shown). The use of such an impact driver to percussively drive a mole forward into a pipe is well known in the prior art. The inventors have found that the use of an impact driver is not necessary to part and replace ordinary lengths of pipe. However, where the pipe includes various types of clamps and joints that can strengthen the pipe at the location of such clamps and joints, the use of an impact driver to aid in moving the mole <b>40</b> through the pipe, may be beneficial.</p>
    <p>The pipe parting blades <b>56</b> are preferably disposed within a blade holding slot <b>184</b> formed in the tapered body <b>44</b> and cylindrical section <b>140</b> of the mole <b>40</b>, and blade retaining pins <b>188</b> are disposed in retaining pin bores formed through the tapered portion <b>44</b> and the inner portions of the blades <b>56</b>. The blades <b>56</b> are preferably formed of a hardened steel and are sharpened on the outer edge <b>180</b> to facilitate the pipe parting function of the blades <b>56</b>.</p>
    <p>The pipe scoring wheels <b>52</b> are preferably engaged in a scoring wheel holding member that is disposed within a scoring wheel slot <b>192</b> cut into the cylindrical portion <b>140</b> of the mole <b>40</b>, and retaining pins <b>196</b> which project through retaining pin bores are utilized to hold the scoring wheel mechanisms in place. It is therefore to be understood that both the scoring wheels <b>52</b> and the blades <b>56</b> are removably engagable with the mole <b>40</b>, such that they can be easily replaced when it is necessary to do so.</p>
    <p>An alternative mole <b>220</b> is depicted in FIGS. 4 and 5, wherein FIG. 4 is a side elevational view and FIG. 5 is an end elevational view. The mole <b>220</b> includes a tapered nose portion <b>224</b> having a cable engagement bore <b>228</b> formed therethrough. A generally cylindrical body portion <b>232</b> having a central axis <b>236</b> is integrally formed with the nose portion <b>224</b>. A non-concentrically tapered body portion <b>240</b> is formed rearwardly of the cylindrical portion <b>232</b>. The tapered portion <b>240</b> is excentrically formed such that one external surface <b>244</b> is a straight line extension of the cylindrical surface <b>248</b> of the cylindrical portion <b>232</b>. The opposite surface <b>252</b> of the tapered portion <b>240</b> is flared outwardly relative to the surface <b>256</b> of the cylindrical portion <b>232</b>. It is therefore to be understood that the surfaces <b>244</b>, <b>248</b> and <b>256</b> are parallel to the center line <b>236</b>, whereas the surface <b>252</b> diverges from the center line <b>236</b> toward the rearward portions of the mole <b>220</b>.</p>
    <p>A rearward portion <b>260</b> of the mole <b>220</b> includes a rearwardly extending replacement pipe engagement shoulder <b>264</b> and a pipe engagement sleeve <b>268</b>, which together cooperate with pipe retaining screws <b>272</b> to hold a leading edge of a section of replacement pipe <b>278</b>. A generally tapered impact driver bore <b>282</b> is preferably formed in the rearward end <b>260</b> of the mole <b>220</b> to provide a mating engagement with a tapered nose portion of an impact driver (not shown), as has been described hereabove with regard to mole <b>40</b>, depicted in FIGS. 2 and 3. A pair of pipe scoring wheels <b>288</b> and <b>292</b> are disposed in a scoring wheel retaining mechanism that is held in place by a pin <b>296</b>. The pipe scoring wheels <b>288</b> and <b>292</b> are preferably arranged such that the first wheel <b>288</b> scores the pipe a first distance into its interior wall, and the second scoring wheel <b>292</b> scores the pipe in the same track an additional distance into the interior wall of the pipe to facilitate the parting of the pipe. A pipe parting blade <b>300</b> having a sharpened edge <b>304</b> is disposed within the tapered side <b>252</b> of the mole <b>220</b> to part the pipe along the line scored by the wheels <b>288</b> and <b>292</b>. A blade retaining pin <b>308</b> facilitates the replaceable engagement of the blade <b>300</b> with the mole <b>220</b>. In the preferred embodiment, another pipe scoring wheel <b>316</b> is disposed on the straight, opposite side of the mole <b>220</b> from the two scoring wheels <b>288</b> and <b>292</b>. The pipe scoring wheel <b>316</b> is replaceably engaged utilizing a wheel retaining pin <b>320</b> in the manner previously described herein. Additionally, a hardened steel skid plate <b>328</b> is engaged to the straight side of the mole <b>220</b> utilizing an engagement slot <b>332</b> that is formed axially into the lower surface of the mole <b>220</b>. The scoring wheel <b>316</b> further facilitates the parting of the pipe when it is expanded by the non-concentric tapered portion <b>240</b>, and the hardened steel skid plate <b>328</b> provides a longer useful lifetime to the mole <b>220</b>. A cable pulling frame <b>84</b> is next described.</p>
    <p>The cable pulling frame <b>84</b> as depicted in FIGS. 6 and 7, includes a generally U-shaped base member <b>400</b> which is preferably made from three pieces of rectangular steel stock that are welded together at their ends. Significantly, a fourth frame member that would create a square base is omitted, such that a gap <b>404</b> is provided. The gap <b>404</b> facilitates the placement of the frame <b>84</b> onto an existing length of cable <b>70</b> that projects outwardly from the end <b>36</b> of the pipe <b>14</b>. A plurality of reaction plate alignment pins <b>406</b> project from the base member <b>400</b> for the aligned engagement of the frame <b>84</b> with the reaction plate <b>96</b>, as is described hereinbelow. An inner end <b>408</b> of each of the leg members <b>88</b> is engaged, such as by welding, to a corner of the U-shaped base member <b>400</b> to create a stable frame structure. The outer ends <b>412</b> of the leg members <b>88</b> are engaged together by frame members <b>416</b>, such as by welding, to form a strong stable structure. The leg members <b>88</b> and frame members <b>416</b> are preferably made from rectangular, tubular steel stock. The cable pulley <b>92</b> is rotatably mounted to an axle <b>424</b> that is engaged to the frame members <b>416</b>. The annulus <b>124</b> is a generally cylindrical tubular member having a cable passage bore <b>428</b> formed therethrough, and an outer portion of its sidewall is removed to form a cable passage slot <b>430</b>. The slot <b>430</b> functions such that the cable <b>70</b> may be placed into bore <b>428</b> of the annulus <b>124</b> from its side through the slot <b>430</b>; whereby it is not necessary to thread the end of the cable through the annulus <b>124</b>. As is best seen in FIG. <b>11</b> and described in detail hereinbelow, a mounting shoulder <b>434</b> projects into the slotted bore <b>428</b> of the annulus <b>124</b> to facilitate the removable mounting of the cable pulling device <b>120</b> therewithin.</p>
    <p>The frame bracing reaction plate <b>96</b> of the present invention is depicted in FIG. <b>8</b>. The reaction plate is a generally rectangular or square flat member that is preferably formed from a strong, light weight metal, such as an aluminum alloy. The reaction plate serves to provide a firm footing for the base member <b>400</b> of the cable pulling frame <b>84</b>; thus, the plate <b>96</b> is formed with a sufficient thickness to reactively withstand the cable pulling forces that the frame <b>84</b> places against the wall <b>100</b> of the pipe access hole <b>32</b>. A cable passage slot <b>104</b> is formed from a side of the plate <b>96</b> towards its center. The slot <b>104</b> permits the plate <b>96</b> to be installed around cable <b>70</b> that is already engaged to a mole <b>40</b> and projects outwardly through the end <b>36</b> of a pipe <b>14</b>. A plurality of frame engagement holes <b>439</b> are formed in the plate <b>96</b> to matingly engage the base plate alignment pins <b>406</b> of the cable pulling frame <b>84</b> for the aligned engagement of the frame <b>84</b> with the base plate <b>96</b>. In the field it is not always possible to place the reaction plate <b>96</b> in a preferred, vertical manner as depicted in FIG. 8, and it may be necessary to place the reaction plate in a rotated manner. It would, however, still be desirable to place the mounting frame in a generally vertical orientation. To achieve this, additional sets of mounting holes <b>439</b>A and <b>439</b>B are advantageously formed in the reaction plate <b>96</b> to provide rotated mounting hole configurations into which the mounting pins <b>406</b> can be inserted to achieve a more nearly vertical mounting of the frame <b>84</b> with a rotated reaction plate <b>96</b>.</p>
    <p>It is to be understood that a significant feature of the frame member <b>84</b> is that a mole-attached cable <b>70</b> can be wrapped around the pulley <b>92</b>, such that the interior portion <b>440</b> of the cable <b>70</b> projects between the legs <b>88</b> of the frame <b>84</b> and the outer end portion <b>444</b> of the cable <b>70</b> projects upwardly through the annulus <b>124</b> for engagement to a cable pulling device <b>120</b>. Other and different frame construction configurations can readily be developed which provide the strength and stability of the frame member <b>84</b>, and such alternative frame members are described hereinbelow.</p>
    <p>A cable pulling device that is suitable for use in the present invention is depicted in a side elevational view in FIG. 9 and a cable engaging collet of the cable puller is depicted in FIG. <b>10</b>. The cable puller <b>120</b> is preferably formed with two parallelly disposed hydraulic pistons <b>510</b> having outer piston housings <b>512</b> that are mounted at their rearward ends <b>514</b> to a rear end fixture <b>516</b>. A forward end fixture <b>528</b> is engaged to the forward ends of the outer housings <b>512</b>. The hydraulic lines <b>132</b> are engaged to the end fixtures <b>516</b> and <b>528</b> through a suitable coupling <b>518</b> such that hydraulic fluid passes through the hydraulic lines <b>132</b>, through the end fixtures <b>516</b> and <b>528</b> and into the two hydraulic pistons <b>510</b>. Hydraulic push rods <b>524</b> project outwardly from the forward end fixture <b>528</b> and are fixedly engaged to a front end block <b>536</b>. A slotted, generally cylindrical nose piece <b>540</b> is engaged to the front end block <b>536</b>. The nose piece <b>540</b> is formed with a cable passage slot <b>544</b> cut through a side of the nose piece <b>540</b>, and the outer diameter of the nose piece <b>540</b> is sized to mount within the shoulder <b>434</b> of the slotted annulus <b>124</b> of the frame member <b>84</b>, as is described hereinbelow with the aid of FIG. 11. A generally U-shaped cable passage slot, generally denoted by the numeral <b>550</b> is formed in each of the front end block <b>536</b>, forward end fixture <b>528</b> and the rear end fixture <b>514</b>, such that the cable <b>70</b> can be installed within the cable pulling device <b>120</b> from its side. That is, it is not necessary to thread an end of the cable <b>70</b> through the cable pulling device <b>120</b>.</p>
    <p>A plurality of cable pulling collets <b>560</b> are removably engaged within the cable passage slot <b>550</b> of the forward end fixture <b>528</b>. As depicted in FIG. 10, each collet <b>560</b> is formed with a concave inner face <b>564</b> having a plurality of cable engaging ridges <b>568</b> cut into the inner surface thereof. The cable engaging ridges <b>568</b> are cut in a saw-tooth manner to create a one-way cable engagement surface. Collet retaining pins <b>576</b> are disposed in the front end fixture <b>528</b> to facilitate the replacement of collet members <b>560</b> when necessary. The gripping motion of the collets is enhanced by a collet biasing spring <b>578</b> that is engaged to the front end fixture and causes the collets to move in a synchronous manner to engage and disengage the cable <b>70</b>. A preferred cable pulling device <b>120</b> utilizes two collets <b>560</b> disposed around the cable <b>70</b> to effectively engage the cable while permitting the easy side wise installation of the cable <b>70</b> within the collets <b>560</b>. The cable puller <b>120</b> may be any of several such pulling devices, as have been built by any of several companies, and have been used for a number of years as post tensioning devices for post tensioning steel cable or rod, such as rebar, in concrete structures, and for tensioning bridge cable, in the bridge building industry. A device that is preferably used as the cable puller <b>120</b> is designed as a bridge cable tensioning device, used in the bridge construction industry, such as is manufactured and sold by the Chowder Machine Company of the State of Washington. Such post tensioning devices, also termed Post Tensioning Rams (PTR), have never before been used to pull a length of cable, for pulling or lifting objects; this use has heretofore been assigned to winches, and/or block and tackle, and chain hoists. In the present invention the PTR is used for pulling the mole using varying lengths and size of cable from a few feet, to several thousand feet and the pulling force is not affected by cable length. Such PTR devices are light weight as compared to their pulling capability, generally pulling in excess of ½ ton per pound of weight, such that a 70 pound device <b>120</b> can place a 35 ton pulling force on the cable <b>70</b>. The PTR in the present invention uses high pressure hydraulics (5,500 to 20,000 PSIG) to give the intense pulling power it delivers, and the PTR's light weight and <b>20</b> portability, are the result of using high pressure hydraulics in small hydraulic cylinders. Typical prior art winches, etc., that produce such force levels can themselves weigh 2-5 tons. Thus a significant advantage of the present invention is the use of the light weight bridge cable tensioning device as a cable pulling device <b>120</b>, which allows a single man to install and operate the present invention in the small hole <b>32</b>.</p>
    <p>It is therefore to be understood that when hydraulic pressure is applied to the two piston members <b>510</b>, that the outer housing portions <b>512</b> of the pistons <b>510</b> will move laterally rearwardly <b>580</b> relative to the piston rods <b>524</b> and the front end block <b>536</b>. It is also to be realized that when the nose piece <b>540</b> of the cable pulling device <b>120</b> is mounted in the annulus <b>124</b> of the frame <b>84</b>, that the front end block <b>536</b> will remain stationary while the forward end fixture <b>528</b> and the two piston outer housings <b>512</b> will move rearwardly. Additionally, it is to be understood that the collet members <b>560</b> are disposed within the movable forward end fixture <b>528</b>, and that when the collets <b>560</b> move rearwardly relative to the cable <b>70</b>, that the saw-tooth ridges <b>568</b> of the collets <b>560</b> will grab the outer surface of the cable <b>70</b> and pull it rearwardly. Finally, after the piston housings <b>512</b> have traveled rearwardly to the extent of a piston stroke, the housings <b>512</b> will return to the forward position and, significantly, the collet ridges <b>568</b> will release their hold upon the cable and slide forwardly along the surface of the cable <b>70</b>. Thus, with each repeatable, rearward cable pulling stroke of perhaps three to six inches, depending upon the piston travel <b>580</b> of the cable pulling device <b>120</b>, the collet ridges <b>568</b> will pull the cable <b>70</b> rearwardly. Thereafter, upon the return stroke of the cable pulling device <b>120</b>, the cable <b>70</b> will remain stationary while the collets <b>560</b> slide along its outer surface. Thus, each cable pulling stroke will pull the cable rearwardly, until, ultimately, the cable with its attached pipe parting mole will be pulled entirely through the pipe <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p>A detailed depiction of the mounting of the cable puller nose piece <b>540</b> within the annulus <b>124</b> is provided in FIG. <b>11</b>. As depicted therein, the cable passage slot <b>430</b> is formed through the sidewall of the annulus <b>124</b> to permit the side wise mounting of a cable <b>70</b> into the cable passage bore <b>428</b>. A shoulder <b>434</b> projects inwardly into the cable passage bore <b>428</b> to provide a stop on the inward insertion of the cable puller nose piece <b>540</b> within the cable passage bore <b>428</b>, and the outer diameter of the nose piece <b>540</b> is sized to slidably fit within the cable passage bore <b>428</b> until the front surface <b>584</b> of the nose piece <b>540</b> rests against the shoulder <b>434</b>.</p>
    <p>As has been described hereinabove, the preferred method for installing the various components of the present invention upon a cable <b>70</b> is the side wise insertion of the cable <b>70</b> through the mounting slots <b>430</b> and <b>544</b> of the annulus <b>124</b> and nose piece <b>540</b> respectively. As depicted in FIG. 11, a preferred orientation of the annulus <b>124</b> and nose piece <b>540</b>, following the insertion of the cable <b>70</b> within the cable mounting slots <b>430</b> and <b>544</b> respectively, is to rotate <b>588</b> the cable puller slot <b>544</b> through a <b>90</b> or more degree angle relative to the annulus slot <b>430</b>. Thereafter, when the nose piece <b>540</b> is inserted within the annulus bore <b>428</b>, the cable <b>70</b> will become locked into the mated structure. That is, if the two slots <b>544</b> and <b>430</b> are aligned, then the cable <b>70</b> can escape through the aligned slots, whereas the rotation <b>588</b> of the nose piece <b>540</b> relative to the annulus <b>124</b> creates a cable enclosing mated configuration. The inventors have found that the preferred, rotated mounting configuration maintains the cable <b>70</b> in proper alignment within the cable pulling collets <b>560</b>, which improves the performance and reliability of the device.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 12 and 13 depict an alternative, three-legged cable pulling frame <b>600</b> of the present invention, wherein FIG. 12 is a side elevational view and FIG. 13 is an end elevational view. As depicted in FIGS. 12 and 13, the three-legged cable pulling frame <b>600</b> includes a first base leg <b>604</b>, a second base leg <b>608</b> and a top leg <b>612</b>, each of which is preferably formed from rectangular tubular steel stock. The front ends <b>616</b> of each of the legs <b>604</b>, <b>608</b> and <b>612</b> are engaged, such as by welding to a front mounting plate <b>620</b>, and a cable passage slot <b>624</b> is formed upwardly through the plate <b>620</b>, such that a cable <b>70</b> is mountable therethrough. Further structural members <b>630</b> are utilized to engage the rearward ends <b>634</b> of the leg members <b>604</b>, <b>608</b> and <b>612</b> together, such as by welding, to form a strong structure. A pulley <b>640</b> is rotatably mounted upon an axle <b>644</b> that is mounted within axle bores <b>648</b> formed through a pulley mounting plate <b>656</b> that is engaged, such as by welding, to the leg members <b>604</b>, <b>608</b> and <b>612</b> and the frame members <b>630</b>. It is to be realized that such a mounting plate <b>656</b> is disposed on each side of the pulley <b>640</b> to engage both ends of the axle <b>644</b>. An annulus mounting plate <b>670</b> having a cable passage slot <b>674</b> formed therein is engaged, such as by welding, to the upper ends <b>676</b> of the frame members <b>530</b>, and a slotted cylindrical annulus <b>680</b> is fixedly engaged, such as by bolting or welding to the annulus mounting plate <b>670</b>. The annulus <b>680</b> is preferably similar in design to the annulus <b>124</b> described above. Thus the annulus slot and the mounting plate slot <b>674</b> are aligned to permit the sideways mounting of a cable <b>70</b> therewithin.</p>
    <p>A single reaction plate mounting pin <b>682</b> is formed on the plate <b>620</b> to facilitate the mounting of the frame <b>600</b> with a mating bore (such as mounting pin bores <b>439</b>) formed in a reaction plate, to which the frame <b>600</b> is removably engaged in a manner described hereinabove with regard to frame <b>84</b> and reaction plate <b>96</b>. To further facilitate the engagement of the plate <b>620</b> with a reaction plate <b>96</b>, a generally cylindrical cable guide member <b>684</b> is engaged within the slot <b>624</b>. The guide member is also formed with a slotted cable passage bore <b>686</b> to permit the sideways insertion of the cable <b>70</b> therewithin. The guide member <b>684</b> is preferably formed with a smaller diameter portion <b>688</b> for mating insertion within the slot <b>624</b> of the plate <b>620</b>, and a larger, outer diameter portion <b>690</b> for mating insertion within the cable mounting slot <b>104</b> of a reaction plate <b>96</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the guide <b>684</b> is preferably formed from aluminum to provide a soft guide surface for interaction with the outer surface of the cable <b>70</b>.</p>
    <p>As compared with the four-legged cable pulling frame depicted in FIGS. 6 and 7, the three-legged frame of FIGS. 12 and 13 is generally lighter in weight and shorter in length. These features are generally advantageous because the lighter weight facilitates easier installation and manipulation by a user, and the shorter length facilitates the installation of the frame <b>600</b> in a smaller hole <b>32</b> than the longer legged frame <b>84</b>. It is to be realized that the frame <b>600</b>, like the frame <b>84</b>, is mountable upon a pre-installed cable <b>70</b>, such that the extending end of the cable <b>70</b> may be inserted within the cable mounting slots <b>684</b> and <b>624</b>, wrapped around the pulley <b>640</b> and installed within the cable mounting slot <b>674</b> of the plate <b>670</b> and within the slotted annulus <b>680</b>.</p>
    <p>Still another cable pulling frame <b>700</b> of the present invention is depicted in FIGS. 14 and 15, therein FIG. 14 is a side elevational view and FIG. 15 is an end elevational view. As depicted in FIGS. 14 and 15, the frame <b>700</b> includes a left plate member <b>704</b> and a right plate member <b>708</b> that are fixedly engaged at a forward edge <b>712</b> to a front plate <b>716</b>. The engagement may be by welding, threaded bolts or other conventional means. The front plate <b>716</b> is formed with an upwardly projecting cable insertion slot <b>720</b> and a reaction plate mounting pin <b>724</b>, which is similar to mounting pin <b>682</b> of frame <b>600</b> and which mounts into a mating bore (such as bores <b>439</b>) formed in a reaction plate. As with frame <b>600</b>, a slotted guide member <b>730</b> may be engaged within the slot <b>720</b>, which guide member <b>730</b> has an enlarged outer diameter portion <b>732</b> to slidably fit within a cable slot <b>104</b> formed in a reaction plate <b>96</b>. A cable pulley <b>740</b> is rotatably mounted upon an axle <b>744</b> that projects through axle mounting holes <b>748</b> formed through the side plates <b>704</b> and <b>708</b>. An annulus mounting plate <b>760</b> is fixedly engaged, such as by welding or threaded bolts to the top portions <b>764</b> of the side plates <b>704</b> and <b>708</b>, and a cable mounting slot <b>770</b> is cut into the plate <b>760</b> for insertion of the cable <b>70</b> therethrough. A slotted annulus <b>780</b>, similar in design to annulus <b>124</b>, is mounted upon the plate <b>760</b>, such as by welding or the utilization of threaded bolts, to provide for the mounting of a nose piece <b>540</b> of a cable pulling device <b>120</b> therewithin.</p>
    <p>Frame <b>700</b> is generally easier to fabricate than frame <b>600</b>, although its overall dimensions are quite similar. Frame <b>700</b> generally consists of fewer components than frame <b>600</b> and is easier to assemble, whether by welding or the use of threaded bolts. It is to be understood that the frame <b>700</b>, like frame <b>600</b> and frame <b>84</b>, may be mounted upon a projecting end of an in-place cable <b>70</b>, such that the cable <b>70</b> is mounted sideways into the cable insertion slots and wrapped around the pulley <b>740</b>, as has been described in detail hereabove.</p>
    <p>A further embodiment of the present invention is depicted in FIGS. 16, <b>17</b> and <b>18</b>, in which FIG. 16 is an exploded perspective view, FIG. 17 is an end elevational view of an adapted annulus member <b>800</b> and FIG. 18 is a side elevational view of the annulus member <b>800</b> depicted in FIG. <b>17</b>. As depicted in FIG. 16, a generally rectangular reaction plate <b>804</b> is formed with a cable insertion slot <b>808</b> therewithin. Generally cylindrical annulus member <b>800</b> is formed with an inner, generally cylindrical nose portion <b>820</b>, having an outer diameter that is sized for insertion within the width of the slot <b>808</b>. The annulus member <b>800</b> further includes an enlarged body portion <b>828</b> having a diameter that is significantly larger than the diameter of the nose portion <b>820</b>, such that the enlarged portion <b>828</b> provides a large contact area <b>832</b> (shown in phantom upon the surface of the reaction plate <b>804</b>) when the nose <b>820</b> of the annulus member <b>800</b> is inserted within the slot <b>808</b> of the reaction plate <b>804</b>. A cable passage bore <b>840</b> is formed axially through the annulus member <b>800</b> and a cable mounting slot <b>848</b> is cut through the side of the member <b>800</b>, such that the cable <b>70</b> may be sideways inserted into the cable bore <b>840</b>. As with the annulus member <b>124</b>, described hereinabove, the center bore <b>840</b> is formed with a diameter sized for the insertion of the nose piece <b>540</b> of a cable pulling device <b>120</b>, and an inwardly projecting shoulder <b>856</b> is formed within the bore <b>840</b> to form a stop on the inward insertion of the nose piece <b>540</b> within the bore <b>840</b>. It is therefore to be understood that the embodiment depicted in FIGS. 16, <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> facilitates the direct usage of the cable pulling device <b>120</b> in a horizontal orientation within an access hole <b>32</b>, or within a pre-existing space, such as a large sewer main or a building basement, where it is not necessary to reorient the cable vertically out of a hole, such as hole <b>32</b> depicted in FIG. <b>1</b>.</p>
    <p>In some working environments, a backward pulling force such as cable stretch or plastic pipe stretch may exist upon the cable <b>70</b> such that the cable may be pulled backwardly into the pipe <b>14</b> between the pulling strokes of the cable pulling device <b>120</b>. In such a situation, a retaining collet may be inserted within the bore <b>428</b> of the annulus <b>124</b>. Such a retaining collet includes two or more collet members such as collet members <b>560</b>, held within a slotted cylindrical member, and which collets have reverse sawtooth ridges that grip the cable upon its movement backwards within the annulus.</p>
    <p>Upon consideration of the various preferred embodiments described in detail hereinabove, it is to be understood that a generalized description of the present invention includes a mole, a cable attachable to the mole for pulling it through a pipe, a cable pulling device that is engagable to the cable and a cable pulling device engagement means which functions to provide a reactive support for the cable pulling device. In various embodiments, the cable pulling device engagement means includes the reaction plate and an annulus type member for holding the cable pulling device and may further include the various mounting frames and their components depicted and described herein. Significant features of the mole of the present invention include a plurality of pipe scoring wheels wherein two such wheels may be located on one side of the mole for enhanced pipe scoring, and wherein pipe scoring wheels can be located at 180° opposite surfaces of the mole for enhanced pipe scoring and parting of the pipe along the opposing scored lines. The preferred cable pulling device of the present invention is a hydraulic bridge cable tensioning device that operates in a cyclic cable pulling manner, having repeatable short pulling strokes. The cable is sideways mountable within the cable pulling device for ease of mounting and assembly. The cable pulling frames components and annulus are formed with cable mounting slots, such that these components may also be sideways mounted upon the cable for ease of assembly of the device.</p>
    <p>A further mole design <b>900</b> is depicted in FIGS. 19, <b>20</b> and <b>21</b>, wherein FIG. 19 is a side elevational view of the mole <b>900</b> depicted in a pipe bursting operation; FIG. 20 is a front elevational view of the mole <b>900</b> and FIG. 21 is a side elevational view of the mole <b>900</b> depicted in a further stage of a pipe bursting operation. As depicted in FIG. 19, the mole <b>900</b> is being pulled through a pipe <b>904</b> composed of fracturable material, such as cast iron or ceramic pipe. A pulling cable <b>70</b> is engaged to the mole <b>900</b> as has generally been described hereinabove. The mole <b>900</b> includes a tapered body portion <b>908</b> having a front end <b>912</b> whose diameter is less than the diameter of the pipe <b>904</b> and a rearward end <b>914</b> whose diameter is greater than the diameter of the pipe <b>904</b>. The tapered body <b>908</b> of the mole engages the pipe at a pipe engagement region <b>916</b> generally existing between the dotted pipe engagement lines <b>920</b>, such that a forward, intact section of pipe <b>924</b> exists in front of the engagement lines <b>920</b> and fractured pipe segments <b>928</b> exist behind the pipe engagement lines <b>920</b>. It is therefore to be understood that a generalized outward force that is uniformly, circumferentially applied to the pipe <b>904</b> in the engagement region <b>916</b> causes the pipe material to fracture due to the large pulling force applied to the mole <b>900</b> through the cable <b>70</b>. Therefore, in the mole embodiment <b>900</b> a smooth tapered surface mole is utilized to burst the fracturable pipe <b>904</b>.</p>
    <p>As depicted in FIG. 19, a cylindrical bore is formed axially through the mole <b>900</b>. The bore includes a forward portion <b>940</b> having a first diameter and a rearward portion <b>944</b> having a larger diameter, such that a shoulder <b>948</b> is formed in the inner surface of the central bore. A cable engaging member <b>960</b> having a round base portion <b>962</b> and a forwardly projecting cable engagement tongue <b>966</b> is insertable into the mole <b>900</b> from the rearward end of the bore <b>944</b>. The diameter of the round portion <b>962</b> is sufficiently large to engage the shoulder <b>948</b> and a cable engagement hole <b>970</b> is formed in the outer portion of the tongue <b>966</b> such that the cable may be engaged thereto. As has been discussed hereinabove, replacement pipe <b>60</b> is engaged to the rearward end of the mole <b>900</b>, such as through the use of a retaining sleeve <b>156</b> as described hereinabove.</p>
    <p>A single blade <b>980</b> may be engaged within a blade holding slot <b>984</b> to project from the side of the tapered body portion <b>908</b>. Significantly, the frontward edge <b>988</b> of the blade <b>980</b> is disposed rearwardly of the pipe fracturing region <b>916</b>, such that the blade <b>980</b> is not utilized in the pipe fracturing activity of the mole <b>900</b>. The blade <b>980</b> is utilized where the mole <b>900</b> encounters pipe engagement fixtures such as the pipe flanges <b>990</b> which include a flexible seal <b>994</b>. Specifically, as depicted in FIG. <b>21</b> and in comparison to FIG. 19, the mole <b>900</b> has been pulled (leftward) through the pipe <b>904</b> past the flange members <b>990</b>, such that the pipe around the flange members has been fractured. Nevertheless, the flexible seal member <b>994</b> has remained intact. In testing with smooth tapered surface moles, the inventors have found that such moles work very well in fracturing pipe, however seals such as <b>994</b> sometimes create significant drag. Blade <b>980</b> thus augments the mole <b>900</b> by providing a sharp edge which will cut through the seal <b>994</b>, whereby it will pass around the mole and not create a drag problem. It is therefore the case that a smooth tapered mole, without any fins is quite adequate to fracture and replace fracturable pipe such as cast iron and ceramic. Where certain types of pipe joinder fixtures are encountered, a blade <b>980</b> may be required to efficiently remove portions of the pipe engagement fixture from around the mole.</p>
    <p>Still further alternative mole designs are depicted in FIGS. 22 and 23, wherein FIG. 22 is a side elevational view depicting an alternative fin design with a mole, and FIG. 23 is a side elevational view of the fin depicted in FIG. <b>22</b>. As depicted in FIG. 22, a mole <b>1000</b> is formed with a tapered body portion <b>1004</b> having a front end <b>1008</b> whose diameter is less than the diameter of a pipe (not shown) through which the mole will be pulled, and a rearward end <b>1012</b> having a diameter that is larger than the diameter of the pipe. The mole <b>1000</b> is therefore substantially similar to the mole <b>900</b> depicted in FIGS. 19, <b>20</b> and <b>21</b>. Specifically, a pipe engagement region <b>1016</b> is generally defined as lying between two dotted pipe engagement lines <b>1020</b>. The significant, novel features of the mole <b>1000</b> are found in the shape of a flange seal splitting fin and the method of engagement of the fin to the mole body <b>1004</b>.</p>
    <p>As can be seen with the help of FIG. 23, the fin <b>1030</b> is formed with a relatively narrow frontward portion <b>1034</b> that has a beveled frontward tip <b>1038</b>. The rearward portion <b>1042</b> of the fin projects outwardly and includes a cutting edge <b>1046</b> to engage and cut flange seals, as described hereinabove with regard to mole <b>900</b> and depicted in FIG. <b>21</b>. The rearward edge <b>1050</b> of the fin projects downwardly to form an angle A of approximately 80° with the base <b>1054</b> of the fin.</p>
    <p>Returning to FIG. 22, the fin <b>1030</b> resides in a fin engagement slot <b>1060</b> formed in the surface of the mole body <b>1004</b> such that the narrow frontward portion <b>1034</b> of the fin resides completely within the slot <b>1060</b>. The rearward portion <b>1064</b> of the slot <b>1060</b> is formed with a corresponding approximately 80° angle, such that the rearward portion of the fin (defined by angle A) is matingly engaged therein. The frontward end <b>1070</b> of the slot <b>1060</b> includes a threaded bore <b>1074</b> for receiving a threaded screw <b>1078</b> having a tapered head <b>1082</b>. The frontward edge <b>1086</b> of the slot <b>1060</b> is tapered to receive the head <b>1082</b> of the screw <b>1078</b> therewithin, and the tapered frontward tip <b>1038</b> of the fin <b>1030</b> is matingly engaged by the head <b>1082</b> of the screw <b>1078</b>. It is therefore to be understood that the fin <b>1030</b> resides in the slot <b>1060</b> such that the frontward tip <b>1038</b> is held in place by the head <b>1082</b> of the screw <b>1078</b> and the rearward edge <b>1050</b> of the fin <b>1030</b> is held in place by the rearward end <b>1064</b> of the slot <b>1060</b> that has an angle A of approximately 80°. It will therefore be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the fin <b>1030</b> can easily be removed entirely for general pipe fracturing operations, and that the fin <b>1030</b> can be easily inserted should the need arise.</p>
    <p>FIG. 24 depicts and alternative method for the engagement of a pulling cable <b>70</b> with a mole <b>1100</b>. As depicted therein, the mole <b>1100</b> is formed with a smooth tapered pipe engagement surface <b>1102</b> having a blade slot <b>1103</b> formed therein. A smooth cylindrical bore <b>1104</b> is formed axially into the nose portion <b>1108</b> of the mole <b>1100</b>, and an outwardly projecting shoulder <b>1112</b> connects the bore <b>1104</b> with a larger interior bore <b>1116</b>.</p>
    <p>A generally cylindrical mole engagement nut <b>1140</b> resides within the bores <b>1104</b> and <b>1116</b> of the mole. The nut <b>1140</b> includes a cylindrical outer portion <b>1144</b> that resides within bore <b>1104</b>, an outwardly projecting shoulder <b>1148</b> that matingly engages shoulder <b>1112</b> of the mole, and an enlarged cylindrical portion <b>1152</b> that resides within the mole bore <b>1116</b>. It is therefore to be understood that the nut <b>1140</b> is insertable into the mole through bore <b>1116</b> until the nut shoulder <b>1148</b> engages the mole shoulder <b>1112</b>. A circumferential groove <b>1156</b> is formed in the outer surface of the cylindrical portion <b>1144</b> and a threaded screw <b>1160</b> is insertable in a threaded bore formed in the mole surface <b>1102</b> to hold the nut <b>1140</b> within the mole during the cable attachment process. The nut further includes a projecting hex nut end portion <b>1164</b> that is formed with flat hex nut surfaces, such that a wrench can be applied thereto to rotate the engagement nut <b>1140</b>. The engagement nut <b>1140</b> further includes a cylindrical bore <b>1168</b> that is formed axially into the nut <b>1104</b>. The bore <b>1168</b> terminates at an inwardly projecting shoulder <b>1172</b> which joins an inner threaded bore <b>1178</b>.</p>
    <p>A cable end fixture <b>1182</b> is engaged to the end of the pulling cable <b>70</b> by impact swaging <b>1184</b> an outer sleeve <b>1190</b> of the fixture <b>1182</b> onto the cable <b>70</b>. The end <b>1192</b> of the fixture <b>1182</b> is formed with threads <b>1194</b> that threadably engage the threaded bore <b>1178</b> of the mole engagement nut <b>1140</b>. The fixture <b>1182</b> is further formed with a radially projecting shoulder <b>1196</b> that engages the bore shoulder <b>1172</b> when the fixture <b>1182</b> is fully threadably engaged with the nut <b>1140</b>.</p>
    <p>It is therefore to be understood that the nut <b>1140</b> is first inserted into the mole bore <b>1116</b> and the screw <b>1160</b> is tightened such that it projects into the groove <b>1156</b> to hold the nut within the mole <b>1100</b>. Significantly, the nut <b>1140</b> is rotatable within the mole bore <b>1116</b>. Thereafter, the threaded cable end fixture <b>1182</b> is inserted into the bore <b>1168</b> and a wrench is then operatively engaged with the hex nut end portion <b>1164</b> of the nut <b>1140</b>. The engagement nut <b>1140</b> is thereby rotated until the fixture <b>1182</b> is fully threadably engaged with the nut <b>1140</b>. Thereafter, the pulling force upon the cable <b>70</b> will pull the nut <b>1140</b> and the engagement of the shoulders <b>1148</b> and <b>1112</b> will cause the mole to be pulled with the cable. The mole and cable are rotatable with respect to each other.</p>
    <p>An alternative method for the attachment of replacement pipe to the rearward end of a mole is depicted in FIGS. 25 and 26, wherein FIG. 25 is a side elevational view of the replacement pipe attachment and FIG. 26 is a perspective view of the replacement pipe attachment sleeve. As depicted in FIGS. 25 and 26 a mole <b>1200</b> has a tapered smooth body <b>1204</b> having a relatively narrow frontward end <b>1208</b> and a relatively wide rearward end <b>1212</b>. A threaded, cylindrical sleeve engagement member <b>1216</b> is integrally formed with the mole body <b>1204</b> and projects rearwardly therefrom. As indicated hereabove, such a simple mole performs quite adequately for fracturable pipe such as cast iron and ceramic materials. In fact, such a smooth mole will even split steel pipe due to the large pulling forces applied to it.</p>
    <p>A replacement pipe engagement sleeve <b>1220</b> comprises a generally cylindrical member having cylindrical sidewalls <b>1224</b> that are at least as thick as the sidewalls of the replacement pipe <b>60</b>. The sleeve <b>1220</b> further includes a radially, inwardly projecting wall portion <b>1228</b> having a bore <b>1232</b> formed therethrough, such that the threaded sleeve engagement member <b>1216</b> projects through the bore <b>1232</b> when the sleeve <b>1220</b> is mounted to the rearward end <b>1212</b> of the mole <b>1200</b>. A large threaded nut <b>1240</b> is threadably engaged upon the threads of the sleeve engagement member <b>1216</b> to frictionally engage the inwardly projecting wall <b>1228</b>, such that the threadable tightening of the nut <b>1240</b> will cause the sleeve <b>1220</b> to be engaged to the mole <b>1200</b>. The end <b>1250</b> of the replacement pipe <b>60</b> is thermofusion bonded <b>1254</b> to the wall <b>1224</b> of the sleeve <b>1220</b> after the nut <b>1240</b> has been threadably tightened to engage the sleeve to the mole. It is therefore to be understood that the replacement pipe <b>60</b> is engaged to the sleeve <b>1200</b> utilizing a thermofusion bond <b>1254</b> and the sleeve <b>1200</b> is threadably engaged to the mole <b>1200</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 27 is a side elevational view depicting still another method for the engagement of the replacement pipe to a mole. As depicted therein a mole <b>1300</b>, which is similar to mole <b>1100</b> and <b>1200</b>, is formed with a rearwardly projecting threaded pipe engagement member <b>1304</b>. The replacement pipe <b>60</b> is formed with internal threads <b>1308</b> that threadably engage the threads on the member <b>1304</b>, whereby the replacement pipe <b>60</b> is engaged to the mole <b>1300</b>. A cylindrical sleeve <b>1312</b>, preferably formed of steel or a similar hard metal is disposed externally of the threads <b>1308</b> at the end of the replacement pipe <b>60</b> to prevent the pipe <b>60</b> from separating from the mole <b>1300</b>. A plurality of threaded screw holes <b>1316</b> are formed through the sleeve <b>1312</b> and threaded bolts <b>1320</b> are inserted therewithin to further hold the sleeve <b>1312</b> and pipe <b>60</b> together in engagement with the threaded sleeve engagement member <b>1304</b>.</p>
    <p>An improved PTR cable pulling device <b>1400</b> is depicted in FIG. <b>28</b> and cable pulling collets <b>1404</b> for the device <b>1400</b> are depicted in FIG. <b>29</b>. Comparing the cable pulling device <b>120</b> depicted in FIG. 9 with the cable pulling device <b>1400</b> depicted in FIG. 28, it will be seen that the significant difference between the two cable pulling devices <b>120</b> and <b>1400</b> is that a second pair of collets <b>1408</b> is disposed in the front end block <b>1412</b> of the cable pulling device <b>1400</b> as compared to the front end block <b>536</b> of the PTR cable pulling device <b>120</b>. To accommodate the collets <b>1408</b>, the front end block <b>1412</b> is larger than the front end block <b>536</b> of cable puller <b>120</b>.</p>
    <p>As was previously described with regard to cable puller <b>120</b>, and with reference to FIG. 28, when the hydraulic pistons <b>510</b> are activated the forward end fixture <b>528</b> moves away from the front end block <b>1412</b>. The rearward motion of the forward end fixture <b>528</b> causes the collets <b>560</b> to close upon and grab the cable <b>70</b>, pulling it rearwardly (to the right in FIG. <b>28</b>). Significantly, the front collets <b>1408</b> do not grab the cable <b>70</b> during the rearward motion caused by the movement of the fixture <b>528</b>. After the fixture <b>528</b> has completed its stroke of generally two to six inches, the forward end fixture <b>528</b> returns to its starting position and, the collets <b>560</b> release their hold upon the cable and slide forwardly along the surface of the cable. As has been indicated hereabove, where significant resistive force exists in the cable, the cable may stretch, whereupon the cable will not remain stationary, but rather it returns to its unstretched condition. It has been experienced that a long cable may actually stretch one to three inches, thereby significantly reducing the cable motion gain of each stroke of the cable puller.</p>
    <p>The front collets <b>1408</b> are thus provided to prevent the cable from returning to its unstretched position. Specifically, after a cable pulling stroke, and assuming that there is some cable stretching within the cable, upon release of the rearward collets <b>560</b>, the cable will tend to move towards its unstretched position which would be leftward in FIG. <b>28</b>. At this point the forward collets <b>1408</b> engage the cable and, due to the tapered surfaces <b>1416</b> of the collets <b>1408</b> and the collet engagement surfaces <b>1420</b> of the block <b>1412</b>, the collets <b>1408</b> engage the cable and prevent its leftward motion, thereby retaining the tension in the cable. The frontward collets <b>1408</b> thereby prevent leftward cable motion and increase the efficiency of the cable pulling device by insuring that each cable pulling stroke will pull the cable a full stroke length, without significant cable return motion upon cable release by the pulling collets <b>560</b>. While various collet designs are suitable, as depicted in FIG. 29, the preferred collet design includes two cable engagement members <b>1408</b> that are rotatable about a collet engagement rod <b>1430</b>, and which are pivotable about a rod engagement screw <b>1434</b>. It is therefore to be understood that the improved PTR cable pulling device <b>1400</b> provides for cyclic pulling of the cable <b>70</b> while it prevents any cable return motion between pulling strokes due to the use of the forward cable engaging collets <b>1408</b>.</p>
    <p>Where large pulling forces are required it may be necessary to attach two cables to a single mole and utilize two cable pulling devices, such that each cable pulling device is operating on one of the two cables. To effectively accomplish this, a pulling frame that accommodates two cables and two pulling devices is required. Such a pulling frame is depicted in FIGS. 30, <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> and <b>33</b>, wherein FIG. 30 is a perspective view, FIG. 31 is an end elevational view, FIG. 32 is a side elevational view and FIG. 33 is a top plan view. As depicted in FIGS. 30-33, the dual cable frame <b>1500</b> is similar in many respects to the cable pulling frame <b>700</b> depicted in FIGS. 14 and 15. Specifically, the frame <b>1500</b> is mountable upon a reaction plate <b>96</b>. It includes a left plate member <b>704</b> and a right plate member <b>708</b> that are engaged to a front plate member <b>716</b> that is mountable to the reaction plate <b>96</b> utilizing mounting pins <b>724</b>. A pulley <b>1508</b> having two cable grooves <b>1512</b> is mounted between the left and right plate members. Two slotted annuluses <b>1520</b> and <b>1524</b> are mounted upon a mounting plate <b>1530</b>. Mounting plate <b>1530</b> is formed with a cable passage slot <b>1540</b> that is aligned with the cable passage slot <b>1542</b> formed in the annulus <b>1520</b>, such that a cable can be sideways mounted therethrough. Similarly, mounting plate <b>1530</b> is formed with a cable mounting slot <b>1550</b>, which intersects slot <b>1540</b> and which is aligned with the cable mounting slot <b>1552</b> of the annulus <b>1524</b>, such that a cable can be sideways mounted therewithin. Due to the existence of mounting slot <b>1540</b>, the mounting plate <b>1530</b> is not structurally well supported on both sides. Therefore, an additional structural support member <b>1570</b> is engaged to plate member <b>708</b> beneath the mounting plate <b>1530</b> to provide additional structural support to the mounting plate. As is best seen in FIGS. 30 and 32, the two annulus members <b>1520</b> and <b>1524</b> are mounted at an angle with respect to each other. This angular mounting is necessary in order to provide operational space for the two cable pulling members that will be mounted into the annulus members <b>1520</b> and <b>1524</b>. In order to accomplish the angled mounting, the base portions of the two annulus members are cut at an angle to the central axis thereof. It is therefore to be understood that the dual cable mounting frame <b>1500</b> provides for the simultaneous mounting and usage of two cable pulling devices, each pulling a separate cable that is mounted to a single mole. The dual cable pulling frame thereby permits the user to apply the pulling force of two cable pulling devices to a single mole to pull it through even the most difficult pipe environments.</p>
    <p>The significant advantages of the present invention are its relatively small, light weight components which allow a single operator to transport, install and operate the device for trenchless replacement of underground pipe. The larger pulling force generated by the PTR cable pulling device allows it to pull the mole through pipe of varying diameters and composed of virtually any pipe material, whether it be fracturable (such as cast iron or ceramic) or malleable (such as steel). The relatively low cost of the components permit individual contractors and small companies to effectively compete in a marketplace that heretofore has been reserved for large companies having the manpower and resources to purchase and transport the relatively large and expensive components that heretofore have been necessary to conduct the trenchless replacement of underground pipe.</p>
    <p>While the present invention has been shown and described with regard to its preferred embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that alterations and modifications in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention.
