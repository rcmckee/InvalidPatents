Each mounting base provides for mounting and stabilization of optics mounting rings. A locking platform projects from the mounting base and defines a locking opening having a circular hard metal insert therein that defines a receptacle receiving a resilient member and providing for location of the spline/spindle shaft of a rotatable locking plate. A locking plate of a throw-lever that is rotatable between locking and unlocking positions has angulated and curved cam surfaces for forcibly engaging correspondingly angulated surfaces of the rail to achieve cam energized precision locating and locking engagement with the rail. A non-circular section of a spline/spindle shaft of the throw-lever is receives a drive member in non-rotatable and linearly moveable relation. Resilient members are interposed between the drive member and the hardened insert and prevent free throw-lever movement at the release position thereof.</div>

<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
  <p num="p-0003">The present invention relates generally to quick-release mounting devices for releasably mounting various devices on a support structure. The present invention also relates to firearms and more particularly to releasable sighting or aiming devices for rifles. More particularly, the present invention concerns mounting devices having adjustable locking mechanisms and mounting rings for releasably securing aiming devices, such as the sighting telescopes of rifles and similar firearms and for maintaining optimum sighting accuracy even when the firearm is subjected to repeated heavy recoil when firing high velocity, large bore ammunition. Even more particularly, the present invention concerns locking type mounting rings that enable rifle sighting devices to be simply and efficiently removable and replaceable under field conditions while maintaining a preset zero when replaced.</p>
  <p num="p-0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
  <p num="p-0005">U.S. Pat. No. 4,845,871 of Swan discloses a means for attaching first and second Weaver interface platforms of an optical rifle sight mount using throw-lever actuated locking mechanisms. The throw-lever of Swan is not adjustable, though the patent makes incorrect assumptions of its adjustability. A subsequently developed throw-lever actuated releasable optical sight mount system is set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5,276,988 of Swan, which compensates for the inability of the throw lever to accomplish repeatability of precision positioning over extended periods of repeated firing of tactical rifles. This later patent of Swan discloses a throw-lever actuating mechanism of similar nature as set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 4,845,871, with the exception that the optical sight mount incorporates a buffer element in the form of a shim between the attachment device camming surface and the area to which the attachment device is affixed. U.S. Pat. No. 6,026,580 of Mark C. LaRue, the inventor of the present invention, discloses a self-centering and self-aligning optical sight mounting system, including front and rear mounting ring assemblies and mounting bases for mounting an optical sighting device on a firearm such as a rifle or on other devices.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0006">It is a primary feature of the present invention to provide novel mounting rings for retaining sighting devices, such as telescopes, low light optical devices, mechanical sighting devices on firearms such as rifles and to permit removal and replacement of the sighting devices, even under field conditions, without losing the preset zero of the sighting device;</p>
  <p num="p-0007">It is another feature of the present invention to provide a novel optical sight mounting system which permits one or several daylight, night or close combat optical sighting devices to be selectively interchanged on a firearm in a manner that maintains the preset sighting zero of each of the optical sighting devices with respect to the firearm that is involved; and</p>
  <p num="p-0008">It is also a feature of the present invention to provide a novel optical sight mounting system that employs self-centering and self-aligning optical sight mounting rings that eliminates the need for lapping for achieving a close fit with the tube of an optical sighting device and prevents damage to an optical sighting device by tube distortion from clamping force.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">Though the present invention is discussed herein particularly with its application to adjustable quick-release mounting devices for firearm optical sighting devices, it should be borne in mind that it is not intended to limit the spirit and scope of the present invention solely to use in conjunction with firearms. The present invention clearly has a wide range of application in circumstances where a device is intended to be releasably mounted in stable fashion to a supporting structure. For example, the present invention has application to camera and spotting scope mounts that are used in connection with various sporting events and commercial activities. Many other uses of the present invention will become obvious to one skilled in the art upon acquiring a thorough understanding of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">Briefly, the various objects and features of the present invention are realized by a sighting device mounting system that is designed particularly for mounting to Picatinny rails, Weaver rails or other similar mounting base rail systems. Front and rear, substantially identical throw-lever actuated mounting ring assemblies are provided, each having a base structure having a portion thereof configured for fitting opposed angulated rail surfaces and having a locator element that is received within one of the multiple positioning slots of the rail. The base structures each receive a self-centering and self-aligning tube mounting ring for retaining the tube of an optical sighting device or engaging a circular portion of any supported device.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">The base structures are each provided with integral laterally projecting lock supports, each defining a receptacle receiving the spline/spindle shaft of a rotatable locking plate. The rotatable locking plate has angulated cam surfaces merging with a central curved cam surface for forcibly engaging correspondingly angulated rail surfaces to achieve cam energized locking engagement with the angulated rail surfaces. Throw-levers project from each of the rotatable locking plates to provide for manual rotation of the rotatable locking plates during locking and unlocking. At least a portion of the spline/spindle shaft is of non-circular, typically hexagonal cross-sectional configuration and receives a generally circular drive washer member having a central opening of corresponding non-circular configuration so as to have non-rotatable and linearly moveable relation with the spline/spindle shaft. To provide a light weight optical sight mount for firearms, the mounting base and the support rings of the sight mounting system are preferably composed of a light-weight material such an aluminum alloy, hard polymer material or the like. The mounting base is drilled or otherwise formed to eliminate material and reduce the weight thereof. Since the light weight material are often quite soft and easily yielded by application of forces, hardened metal inserts composed of stainless steel, steel or other suitable hard materials are press-fitted or otherwise seated in appropriate openings or receptacles of the mount structure. These inserts are typically threaded so as to have threaded engagement with retainer elements such as Torx or Allen screws.</p>

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading> <p num="p-0039">Though the present invention is discussed herein particularly as it relates to releasable mounts for firearms, particularly tactical rifles used by military and law enforcement personnel, it is to be understood that this invention has application for support of devices other than optical sighting devices on other objects. Referring now to the drawings and first to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an optical sighting device <b>10</b>, such as a sighting telescope, is supported by front and rear mounting ring assemblies, shown generally at <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, that mount the sighting device on a mounting rail <b>16</b>, such as a Picatinny rail or a Weaver rail or the like which is affixed to a firearm <b>18</b> or other object. The rail <b>16</b> defines a number of evenly spaced upwardly extending mounting projections <b>15</b> with evenly spaced transverse slots <b>17</b> therebetween to provide for selective location of an optical device on the firearm. As is evident in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, each of the spaced upwardly extending mounting projections defines undercut parallel, oppositely angulated clamping surfaces <b>19</b> and <b>21</b> and oppositely angulated, typically upwardly facing support surfaces <b>23</b> and <b>25</b> that are disposed in angulated relation with one another. Each of the clamping surfaces <b>19</b> and <b>21</b> and the support surfaces <b>23</b> and <b>25</b> are initially formed by elongated surfaces, typically extending the length of the rail structure <b>16</b> and are interrupted by transverse slots <b>17</b> that are machined or otherwise formed in evenly spaced relation along the length of the rail.</p>
  <p num="p-0040">Each of the mounting ring assemblies <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> incorporates a mounting base <b>20</b> having an integral, upwardly projecting member or boss <b>22</b> that is internally machined to define a receptacle <b>24</b> within which is received the depending mounting tongue elements <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> of mounting ring sections <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>. The mounting ring sections <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> are secured together by fastener members, such as Torx screws, Allen screws or the like, to establish clamping retention of the mounting ring sections <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> to a tubular housing member of a sighting device such as an optical sighting device or telescope or a laser sighting device. Where fastener members such as retainer screws and set screws are employed to secure soft metal members, such as aluminum members, in assembly, hard metal inserts, typically composed of steel, such as stainless steel, are press-fitted into drilled or bored openings in the soft metal members as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> as well as <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</figref>. These hard metal inserts are typically internally threaded and provide the soft metal members with exceptional resistance to wear or thread damage by hard metal retainer screws and the like. The hard metal inserts may be seated on internal support shoulders of the mounting ring sections to ensure against movement thereof by the forces that are developed when screws are tightened by screwdrivers or by Allen or Torx wrenches.</p>
  <p num="p-0041">In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-15</figref>, as shown particularly in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 12</figref>, one or more shims <b>34</b> are located between the mounting tongue elements <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. The shims ensure proper spacing of the mounting ring sections <b>30</b> and <b>30</b> for optimum gripping relation with the tubular housing of the optical sighting device, without causing collapsing, excessive application of torque force or causing other damage to the tubular housing of the sighting device and the internal sighting mechanism thereof. The fastener screws of each of the mount bases are sequentially tightened to ensure even and efficiently controlled gripping of the tubular housing of the sighting device, without subjecting the tubular housing to torque forces during tightening. This feature ensures against mount tightening force deformation of tubular telescope sections and thus ensures protection of delicate internal telescope components from damage and accelerated wear.</p>
  <p num="p-0042">The mounting base <b>20</b> is configured to define a rail receiving receptacle <b>36</b> with spaced, downwardly and oppositely angulated surfaces <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> which are oriented for contact with correspondingly angulated support surfaces <b>23</b> and <b>25</b> of the rail <b>16</b>. The mounting base <b>20</b> also defines an upwardly angulated surface <b>42</b> that is positioned for retaining engagement with a correspondingly angulated clamping surface <b>21</b> of the rail <b>16</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0043">A locking platform <b>44</b> is integral with and extends laterally from each of the mounting bases <b>20</b> and defines an opening <b>46</b> within which is seated an annular insert <b>48</b> that is composed of a suitable hard, wear and impact resistant metal material such as steel, stainless steel, titanium alloy or any suitable non-metal material having wear and impact resistance. The annular insert <b>48</b> defines a central opening <b>50</b> that receives an upwardly projecting circular shoulder <b>52</b> of a spline/spindle shaft or post <b>54</b> in rotatable relation therein. The spline/spindle shaft <b>54</b> is integral with and projects upwardly from a manually rotated cam plate of a locking lever structure <b>56</b>, also referred to as a “throw-lever”, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. The manually rotated locking lever structure <b>56</b> of each ring assembly <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> is manipulated, i.e., rotated, for locking and unlocking of the front and rear mounting bases <b>20</b> from the rail <b>16</b> when it is desired to remove and replace the optical sighting device <b>10</b>. Especially when the sighting device is being used on firearms under tactical circumstances, this feature permits the sighting device to be carried in protective fashion, such as in a pocket of a personnel pack, and when its use is needed, the user will simply and quickly clamp the sighting device to the rail device <b>16</b> of the firearm, with the sighting device being accurately positioned at its pre-set sighting position or zero. This feature permits a sighting device to be unlocked, removed and re-assembled and locked in place without losing its preset aim point or zero.</p>
  <p num="p-0044">The outer or terminal extremity of the spline/spindle shaft <b>54</b> is threaded as shown at <b>58</b> for receiving an adjustment nut <b>60</b>. The threaded section <b>58</b> and the internal threads of the adjustment nut <b>60</b> are cut on a slightly different pitch to cause interference tightening of the nut on the threaded section <b>58</b> of the spline/spindle shaft <b>54</b> as the adjustment nut is rotated in the direction, typically clockwise, during assembly of the adjustment nut to the spline/spindle shaft <b>54</b>. This feature minimizes the potential for loosening of the adjustment nut <b>60</b> after it has been selectively positioned on the spline/spindle shaft <b>54</b>. However, if further tightening or loosening of the adjustment nut is needed, such as for increasing or decreasing the clamping force of the mounting base <b>20</b> on the rail <b>16</b> of a firearm, rotational movement of the adjustment nut <b>60</b> is easily accomplished through the use of a simple hex wrench. The interference tightening arrangement ensures that the adjustment nut <b>60</b> will remain in any pre-set position even when the mounting ring assembly of a sighting device is subjected to impacts, vibration or other rough treatment.</p>
  <p num="p-0045">The spline/spindle shaft <b>54</b> is also provided with a shaft section <b>62</b> of non-circular cross-sectional configuration that may be hexagonal or may have any other non-circular cross-sectional configuration as desired. The shaft section <b>62</b> is also referred to herein as a “spline section”, with the non-circular configuration or spline thereof extending longitudinally of the spline/spindle shaft <b>54</b> from the externally threaded section <b>58</b> to the circular shoulder <b>52</b>. The spline/spindle shaft <b>54</b> and the inner cylindrical surface <b>64</b> of the annular insert <b>48</b> are of significantly different dimensions, thus defining an annular space <b>66</b> therebetween within which a drive washer member <b>68</b> and one or more resilient members are received. The resilient member or members preferably comprise a single wave spring <b>70</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref> and. <b>15</b>, but may comprise one or more resilient O-rings as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> or may comprise one or more washer-like springs referred to as Belleville springs or washers. Typically, however, the spring forces achieved by one or more Belleville springs used in this fashion would be quite high and might add significantly and unnecessarily to the rotational force that is required to rotate the locking lever to and from its locking position and at its unlocked condition. Also, Belleville springs minimize permissible linear movement of the drive washer member <b>68</b> as the springs are subjected to compression force by tightening the adjustment nut <b>60</b>. Thus, Belleville springs are not considered preferred resilient components for the locking lever assembly. The annular insert <b>48</b> defines an upwardly facing internal shoulder surface <b>71</b> which serves to retain the lowermost portion or the lowermost one of the resilient member or members within the annular space <b>66</b>. A lower portion of the drive washer member <b>68</b> extends into the annular space <b>66</b> and defines an annular downwardly facing recess <b>73</b> within which the upper portion of the wave spring <b>70</b> is located to provide for spring centering and stabilization. The wave spring is maintained under compression between the upwardly facing annular surface <b>71</b> and an annular downwardly facing recess surface <b>75</b> of the drive washer member <b>68</b> and imparts a spring force to surfaces <b>71</b> and <b>75</b> that is only great enough to provide sufficient frictional resistance that prevents free rotational movement of the locking lever <b>56</b> when the locking lever is at its unlocked position as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 12</figref>. In other words, the wave spring <b>70</b>, or other resilient member or members <b>99</b>, prevent the locking lever from freely flopping about when it is unlocked. Other resilient members discussed herein provide similar function. This feature is considered important to the tactical use of a firearm, especially in conditions of poor light, where the condition of the locking lever may need to be assured at any point in time, even in its unlocked condition. By minimizing the potential for locking lever movement when it is unlocked, the potential for undesired noise is minimized. This feature is quite important in tactical firearm use.</p>
  <p num="p-0046">The drive washer member <b>68</b> defines a non-circular internal spline section <b>69</b> corresponding to the dimension and configuration of the non-circular external spline of the spline section <b>62</b> of the spline/spindle shaft <b>54</b>. The spline section <b>69</b> may be of hexagonal configuration or any other suitable non-circular configuration having mating, non-rotational relation with the non-circular external portion of the spindle/spline shaft <b>54</b>. This feature causes the drive washer member <b>68</b> to be non-rotatable and linearly moveable with respect to the spline/spindle shaft and rotatable along with the spline/spindle shaft as the locking lever <b>56</b> is manually rotated. Also, the axial length of the spline section <b>62</b> of the spline/spindle shaft <b>54</b> in comparison with the shorter axial length of the non-circular internal spline section <b>69</b> of the drive washer member <b>68</b> permits axial movement of the drive washer member by the adjustment nut <b>60</b> and the wave spring <b>70</b> for the purpose of increasing or decreasing the clamping force of the mounting base <b>20</b> with respect to the rail <b>16</b>. A firearm user is capable of achieving adjustment of the clamping force simply by rotating the adjustment nut with a simple hex wrench or other readily available adjustment tool.</p>
  <p num="p-0047">The locking lever <b>56</b> is provided with an integral cam plate <b>72</b> from which the spline/spindle shaft <b>54</b> projects. Edge portions of the cam plate <b>72</b> define angulated, substantially straight tapered cam surface sections <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> that merge with an intermediate substantially curved tapered cam section <b>78</b> that is located eccentrically with respect to the longitudinal axis of the spline/spindle shaft <b>54</b>. Each of the tapered cam sections is inclined at an angle corresponding to the inclination and orientation of the undercut downwardly facing angulated clamping surface <b>19</b> of the rail <b>16</b>. Thus, manually energized rotation of the cam plate <b>72</b> by application of manual force to the locking lever <b>56</b> causes locking or unlocking movement of the mount assembly with respect to the sight mounting rail of the firearm.</p>
  <p num="p-0048">During locking rotation of the cam plate the eccentric curved cam surface will engage the undercut downwardly facing angulated clamping surface <b>19</b>. As locking rotation continues, due to its eccentric orientation, the clamping force of the curved cam surface will increase as the distance of the curved cam surface from the pivot axis <b>80</b> increases until a maximum clamping force is reached at the merged juncture of the curved cam surface and the locking cam surface <b>76</b>. This maximum clamping force is easily controlled by selective rotation of the adjustment nut <b>60</b> so that metal deformation of the undercut downwardly facing angulated clamping surface <b>19</b> will not occur or will be minimized within acceptable limits. Further locking rotation of the cam plate by the locking lever <b>56</b> causes the substantially straight locking cam section <b>76</b> to move into face to face relation with the angulated clamping surface <b>19</b> of the rail <b>16</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0049">The cam surface sections <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> of the cam plate are positioned with respect to the pivot axis <b>80</b> of the spline/spindle shaft <b>54</b> so that engagement of the cam surface sections tighten on the corresponding angulated rail surfaces as the locking lever is rotated from the unlocking position to the locking position. At the unlocking position of the locking lever <b>56</b> the unlocking surface <b>74</b> is essentially clear of the angulated clamping surface <b>19</b> of the rail <b>16</b>, thus allowing lateral movement of the mounting base <b>20</b> to a position allowing separation of the mounting base from the rail structure. During locking rotation of the locking lever, the curved eccentric section <b>78</b> of the cam surface will engage the downwardly facing angulated surface <b>19</b> that extends along one side of the rail <b>16</b> and will cause forcible engagement of the angulated surfaces of the mounting base with corresponding angulated surfaces of the rail structure. After sufficient rotation of the locking lever has occurred, the substantially arcuate section <b>78</b> of the cam surface will have achieved desired clamping force and the substantially straight locking cam section <b>76</b> will move into locking engagement with the corresponding angulated rail surface <b>19</b>. Since the spacing of the locking cam section <b>76</b> from the axis <b>80</b> is slightly less than the maximum spacing of the curved cam surface from the axis <b>80</b> the force required for rotational locking movement of the locking lever <b>56</b> will decrease slightly when the locking position of the locking lever has been reached. This essentially over-center cam movement feature during locking movement causes the locking lever to remain at its locked position once the locking position has been achieved. When rotating the locking lever <b>56</b> from its locking position to its unlocked position the opposite over-center force transition occurs. During initial unlocking rotation of the cam plate <b>72</b> the curved cam surface section, being located eccentrically with respect to the axis of the spline/pivot shaft <b>80</b>, will cause slight tightening of the clamping force. During further unlocking rotation of the cam plate the curved cam surface section will move clear of the angulated rail surface <b>19</b>, thus releasing the clamping force completely. This feature ensures that the locking mechanism of the mount system remains either locked or unlocked unless manual force is applied to the locking lever by the user. This force enhancing rotary locking movement of the locking lever and the resistance of the locking lever <b>56</b> to be rotated to its unlocking position causes the locking lever to remain at its locked position and effectively prevents inadvertent unlocking movement of the locking lever <b>56</b> even during conditions of rough firearm handling in field conditions.</p>
  <p num="p-0050">The desired cam-induced clamping force of the mounting ring assembly is achieved by rotation of the locking lever to its locked position and by controlled positioning of the locking nut <b>60</b> on the threaded portion of the pivot shaft <b>54</b>. The desired clamping force is typically achieved by controlled rotation of the locking nut <b>60</b> after the wave spring or other resilient member has been substantially fully compressed or bottomed-out by downward movement of the drive washer member <b>68</b> responsive to adjustment rotation of the adjustment nut <b>60</b>. However, from a practical standpoint the user of the firearm will simply adjust the position of the adjustment nut to ensure positive clamping of the mount rings to the rail, without requiring excessive manual force for locking or unlocking movement of the locking lever <b>56</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0051">As mentioned above, one of the requirements for effective use of the releasable and adjustable sighting device ring mounts of the present invention by military and police personnel is the requirement that the mounting system be of light weight for ease of firearm handling and yet have sufficient structural integrity to minimize the potential for optics misalignment (loss of zero) by the repeated heavy impacts and vibration of weapon firing or by rough handling in field conditions. To accomplish these features the basic structure of the mounting base and optics mounting rings is composed of a lightweight metal such as aluminum alloy, or a suitable non-metal material. Inserts of hardened material such as stainless steel are located within openings of the base material either by press-fit or by molding them in place. These hard metal inserts are typically internally threaded to receive fastening screws and positioning screws and thus readily accommodate the severe impacts of repeated rifle firing. The inserts protect the mounting base structure and the mounting ring structure from being deformed, and thus minimize the potential for loss of aiming zero as the result of the multiple impacts that occur during repeated rifle firing. As mentioned above, the annular insert <b>48</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> is composed of any suitable wear and impact resistant material such as steel, stainless steel or a suitable hard polymer material. The upwardly projecting member or boss <b>22</b> is provided with a threaded insert <b>82</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 12</figref> within which a set screw such as an Allen or Torx screw is received to establish retention of the mounting ring tongues <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. The threaded inserts are preferably provided with annular flanges <b>83</b> which seat against soft metal shoulders or other structure and prevent the inserts from being extracted from their openings or receptacles by tightening of the retainer screws. A threaded hard metal insert <b>84</b> is located within the mounting ring tongue <b>28</b> and receives a mounting screw, which extends into screw receptacle <b>86</b> for retention of the mounting ring tongues in assembly within the circular receptacle <b>86</b>. Another threaded insert <b>88</b> is located within one of the ring assembly sections <b>30</b> and receives a retainer screw having a screw head that is located within a screw receptacle <b>90</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">A locator key element <b>92</b>, shown in the bottom view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, is composed of hard wear and impact resistant material is secured to a bottom surface <b>94</b> of the mounting base <b>22</b> by retainer screws <b>96</b> and <b>98</b>. The locator key element <b>92</b> engages within a selected one of the multiple transverse slots <b>17</b> of a mounting rail structure to locate the rear portion of optical sighting device for desired eye relief, which is accomplished by positioning the rear lens of the optical sight device at a selected distance from the eye of the user.</p>
  <p num="p-0053">During assembly of the lever mechanism, the adjustment nut <b>60</b> is tightened sufficiently to apply a desired force to the wave spring <b>70</b>. Thereafter, the preload force of the wave spring urges the locking lever upwardly and develops a friction force that prevents the locking from flopping back and forth when it is unlocked. For precision locking and clamping of the mounting base with respect to the angulated locking or clamping surfaces of the rail <b>16</b>, the adjustment nut <b>60</b> is rotated to a desired position on the threaded spindle/spline shaft <b>54</b> and thus maintains the angulated cam surface <b>76</b> in secure forcible clamping engagement with the angulated locking surface <b>19</b> of the mounting rail <b>16</b>. The splined engagement of the non-circular shaft section <b>62</b> and the internal non-circular section <b>69</b> of the drive washer member <b>68</b> causes the drive washer member to be rotated along with the spindle/spline shaft <b>54</b>. This feature also causes the adjustment nut <b>60</b> of be substantially free of any rotational force that might otherwise tend to loosen or tighten the adjustment nut when the locking lever <b>56</b> is rotated. The adjustment nut <b>60</b> simply rotates along with the spindle or pivot shaft <b>54</b> of the cam plate <b>72</b> and the drive washer member <b>68</b> during manually energized rotation of the locking lever <b>56</b>. The force of the wave spring <b>70</b> also retards inadvertent movement of the locking lever at its unlocked position. In the event that the mount locking system should become loosened by repeated heavy impact firing of the weapon or for any other reason the mounting system can be easily restored to its optimum stable precision positioning characteristics simply by rotating the adjustment nut only by a few degrees of clockwise rotation by using a small hex wrench. This can be easily accomplished in field conditions since no special adjustment tools are required. For example, from 5 degrees to 15 degrees of adjustment nut rotation will restore the locking mount to its proper locking position for support of an optical sighting device such as a rifle telescope.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">An alternative embodiment of the present invention is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> and is different from that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> only in that one or more resilient O-rings <b>99</b> are shown to be located within the annular space <b>66</b> and are compressed to the extent desired by the adjustment nut <b>60</b> and the washer member <b>68</b>. The resilient O-ring <b>99</b> provides rotational resistance to the locking lever and thus prevents the rotatable locking lever <b>56</b> from being loose at its unlocked position, and thus prevents the locking lever from inadvertently moving about. This feature is particularly important when the quick-release mounting system is employed for mounting sighting devices to tactical firearms, where unnecessary lever movement or noise is a detriment to optimum use of the firearm. While one O-ring is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, it is to be understood that two or more O-rings may be employed to accomplish the same purpose.</p>
  <p num="p-0055">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-24</figref>, a mounting assembly is shown generally at <b>100</b> and represents the preferred embodiment of the present invention. However, it is to be borne in mind that many of the features of the mounting assembly of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-12</figref> are incorporated within the mounting assembly of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-24</figref>. The mounting assembly <b>100</b> incorporates a mounting base <b>102</b> having a downwardly facing mounting slot <b>104</b> which is defined by a downwardly facing surface <b>106</b> and by a downwardly extending base flange <b>108</b> having oppositely angulated rail clamping surfaces <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>. Opposite from the downwardly extending base flange <b>108</b> the mounting base <b>102</b> defines another downwardly extending base flange <b>114</b> having formed thereon an angulated clamping surface <b>116</b>. Typically, the downwardly facing mounting slot <b>104</b> is formed by a machining operation, such as by milling the slot in a metal mounting base workpiece.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">A ring mounting member or pedestal <b>118</b> projects upwardly from the mounting base <b>102</b> and may be integral with the mounting base or fixed to it in any suitable manner. The joint of the pedestal <b>118</b> with the mounting base may be strengthened by structural web members <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> if desired, especially since it is desired that the mount assembly be as light weight as possible while maintaining sufficient structural integrity to ensure secure support of a firearm sighting device. The ring mounting member or pedestal <b>118</b>, as shown best in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>, defines opposed substantially co-planar ring support shoulders <b>124</b> and <b>126</b>, with a mounting projection <b>128</b> extending upwardly from the pedestal and between the ring support shoulders. To minimize the weight of the support pedestal and the mounting base <b>102</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref> the mounting base and support pedestal are drilled to remove metal and thus define drill openings <b>123</b>. As is evident from the bottom view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, some of these metal removing drilled openings <b>123</b> extend upwardly into the central mounting projection <b>128</b>. None of the metal removing drilled openings extend completely through the base or mounting pedestal structures, though it is within the spirit and scope of the present invention to do so. The mounting projection <b>128</b> defines spaced transverse bores <b>130</b> and <b>132</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 23</figref> that receive tubular internally threaded ring locator and connector members <b>134</b>. The internally threaded ring locator and connector members extend from an form part of locator and connector inserts <b>136</b> that are received, such as by press fitting within openings <b>138</b> of a mounting ring section <b>139</b>. The inserts <b>136</b> are preferably composed of hard metal such as steel, stainless steel, titanium and the like, and are seated on internal support shoulders <b>140</b> of the openings <b>138</b> of the respective mounting ring section. Mounting screws <b>142</b>, such as Torx screws, Allen screws or the like, are inserted through openings <b>144</b> of the opposite mounting ring section <b>146</b>. Preferably, each mounting ring section <b>139</b> and <b>146</b> is provided with an insert having a tubular internally threaded ring locator and connector member to facilitate ease of assembly of the mounting ring sections to the upwardly extending mounting projection <b>128</b> and to ensure precise location of the mounting sections with respect to the mounting base <b>102</b> and the ring mounting pedestal. The mounting ring sections preferably define annular internal shoulder surfaces <b>145</b> thus enabling the heads of the retainer screws <b>142</b> to draw the lower portions of the mounting ring sections into tight engagement with respective sides of the central mounting projection <b>128</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0057">The mounting ring sections <b>130</b> and <b>146</b> define respective internal arcuate surfaces <b>148</b> and <b>150</b> that are accurately dimensioned to establish frictional retention with respect to a tubular section of an optical sighting device or any other at least partially cylindrical surface of an object that is to be supported in immoveable relation with respect to a firearm or other object to which a mounting rail is fixed. The upper planar surface <b>129</b> of the central mounting projection <b>128</b> is located below an imaginary arcuate surface that is defined by continuation of the arcuate surfaces <b>148</b> and <b>150</b>, thus ensuring that the optical device does not engage the central mounting projection <b>128</b> of the pedestal <b>118</b>. This feature ensures that the cylindrical tube or portion of the optical sighting device remains free of torque forces when the mounting ring sections <b>139</b> and <b>146</b> are tightened to the central mounting projection <b>128</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0058">As shown in detail in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, for securing the upper portions of the mounting ring sections in assembly, internally threaded hardened inserts <b>152</b> are press fitted or otherwise located within openings <b>154</b> of the respective mounting ring sections <b>139</b> and <b>146</b>. Preferably the internally threaded hardened inserts <b>152</b> are seated on annular internal shoulders <b>156</b> of the mounting ring sections to ensure that the inserts are not moved within the openings <b>154</b> by the force that is generated by tightening of the retainer screws. The externally threaded sections <b>158</b> of retainer screws <b>160</b> are threaded into the inserts and serve to secure the mounting ring sections <b>139</b> and <b>146</b> in friction retention with an optical sighting device or other object. The respective mounting ring sections <b>139</b> and <b>146</b> define retainer openings <b>162</b> and annular internal support shoulders <b>164</b> that are engaged by the heads of the retainer screws <b>160</b> and thus enable the retainer screws to tighten the upper portions of the mounting ring sections <b>139</b> and <b>146</b> together and establish fictional retention of the tubular section of the optical sighting device or other object being supported.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">At least two spaced positioning projections <b>166</b> and <b>168</b> extend downwardly from the central portion of the mounting base <b>102</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>, with the space therebetween being sufficient to receive one of the upwardly extending mounting projections <b>15</b>. A locking platform <b>170</b> projects laterally from the mounting base structure <b>102</b> and is preferably formed integrally with the mounting base though it may be fixed to the mounting base in any suitable fashion. The support platform is machined in the same manner as is discussed above in connection with the locking platform <b>44</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref> to form a mounting receptacle for a locking lever mounting assembly which is indicated by like reference numerals and is provided for the same purpose.</p>
  <p num="p-0060">Situations will arise requiring only a single releasable mounting device or requiring more than two spaced releasable mounting devices for mounting optical sighting devices and other objects to firearms. Thus, it is not intended that the present invention be restricted solely to the use of two spaced quick-release mounting devices for mounting firearm optical devices. It is also intended that the present invention have application to a wide range of devices that are intended to be mounted in quick-release, stable fashion to a support structure. Thus, it is not intended to restrict the spirit and scope of the present invention to use in connection with the sighting devices of firearms.
