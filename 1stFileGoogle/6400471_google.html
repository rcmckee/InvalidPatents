    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention relates to the field of digital cameras, and more particularly relates to a platform-independent image processing architecture.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Digital image devices, such as but not limited to digital cameras, are an increasingly popular means for capturing images (in other words, for taking pictures) and for processing the resulting image data.</p>
    <p>In digital cameras, images are represented by data and stored either in the camera's memory or an external memory device from which they can be accessed by a user. A significant advantage to digital cameras is that users then have the capability to manipulate the image data in a number of ways. Users are able to operate on and modify the images, transfer them to other devices, incorporate them into documents, display them in a variety of formats, and the like. Thus, in comparison to conventional cameras, digital cameras introduce a variety of capabilities and enhancements.</p>
    <p>The digital camera incorporates a central processing unit, memory, and many other features of a computer system. Accordingly, the digital camera is capable of concurrently running multiple software routines and subsystems to control and coordinate the various processes of the camera. One subsystem of particular interest is the image processing subsystem that is used for analyzing and manipulating captured image data in a variety of ways, including linearization, defect correction, white balance, interpolation, color correction, image sharpening, and color space conversion. In addition, the subsystem typically coordinates the functioning and communication of the various image processing stages and handles the data flow between the various stages.</p>
    <p>A problem exists in that there are many prior art makes and models of digital cameras incorporating different hardware components and software configurations (that is, “platforms”) for image processing. One make of digital camera may utilize a software mode for image processing, another may implement a hardware mode, and others may implement a mode utilizing various degrees of hardware and software combinations. Typically, this problem is addressed in the prior art by employing an operating system written specifically for the image processing mode used by the particular digital camera platform.</p>
    <p>However, this prior solution is problematic because an operating system designed for one digital camera platform is generally too specialized to function on another platform. Even in those cases where the image processing mode for one camera make/model shares a common aspect with another make/model, it is often not possible to utilize a common operating system because of their specialized natures.</p>
    <p>Consequently, in the prior art it is necessary for manufacturers of digital cameras to, for example, develop, purchase or license more than one version of a digital camera operating system, e.g., one version for each type of digital camera platform that the manufacturer offers. As the manufacturer develops additional makes and models employing various image processing modes, it is likely that different operating systems will also be needed. The need to integrate the development of the operating system with the development of the image processing mode introduces difficulties that could extend the lead time for introduction of a new product. For a manufacturer wishing to offer a number of different models of digital cameras, this can result in substantial effort and expense.</p>
    <p>Similarly, the expense to a vendor of operating systems is also increased due to the need to support multiple digital camera platforms. In the prior art, different versions of operating systems increase development and manufacturing costs. The number of programmers needed to develop and support different operating systems is clearly a function of the number of operating systems that need to be provided. Increased costs are also associated with the support of multiple versions; for example, upgrades must be prepared for each version, and separate users manuals must also be written and published.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, it is desirable to provide an operating system and/or method that can be utilized with the image processing mode used by any digital camera platform. It is also desirable that the operating system and/or method be flexible enough to be adapted to foreseeable digital camera platforms. The present invention provides a novel solution to the above needs.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention provides an operating system that can be utilized with the image processing mode on any digital camera platform. The present invention is also flexible enough to be adapted to foreseeable digital camera platforms.</p>
    <p>The present invention is a system and a method for processing image data in a digital image device such as a digital camera. The present invention includes a bus, a central processing unit coupled to the bus, an image processing subsystem coupled to the central processing unit for processing the image data using a particular processing mode, a memory unit coupled to the bus, and a data storage element for storing the image data after image processing. The memory unit has stored therein an operating system for managing the image processing subsystem, and the memory unit also has a data structure for managing the image data for the image processing subsystem during image processing. The data structure provides an interface between the operating system and the image processing subsystem, such that the operating system is independent of the processing mode used by the image processing subsystem.</p>
    <p>In the present embodiment, the present invention also includes a spooler element for transferring the image data into the data structure, a data line reader element for reading the image data from the spooler element, and a data line writer element for writing the image data to the data storage element. The data line writer element provides an interface between the image processing subsystem and the data storage element that is independent of the processing mode used by the image processing subsystem.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, the processing mode used by the image processing subsystem includes a plurality of image processing modules and a JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) software element. In another embodiment, the processing mode used by the image processing subsystem includes a digital signal processor and a JPEG hardware element. In yet another embodiment, the processing mode used by the image processing subsystem includes an image processing hardware system.</p>
    <p>In the present embodiment, the present invention implements a method for processing image data in a digital image device that includes the following steps: a) creating a data structure corresponding to the image processing mode used by the image processing subsystem; b) initializing the spooler element; c) initializing the data line reader element; d) initializing the data line writer element; e) initializing the image processing subsystem and the data structure; f) forwarding the image data to the data structure using the spooler element; g) processing the image data using the processing mode used by the image processing subsystem; and h) writing the image data to the data storage element.</p>
    <p>The present invention thus provides a flexible architecture for image processing within a digital image device (e.g., digital camera). The present invention permits the use of different modes of image processing while maintaining the same operating system, application program and application program interface. That is, the image processing mode used in a particular digital camera platform is invisible to the operating system and to the application program. The present invention accomplishes this by defining data structures that are flexible enough that different imaging processing subsystems can be implemented without affecting the software/hardware architecture that surrounds the subsystem. The data structures provide a well-defined interface for entering and exiting the image processing subsystem without changing or perturbing the upstream and downstream elements of the digital camera.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The following description is presented to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention and is provided in the context of a patent application and its requirements. Although the present invention will be described in the context of a digital camera, various modifications to the preferred embodiment will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art and the generic principles herein may be applied to other embodiments. That is, any digital image device which processes, displays and/or prints digital images, icons and/or other items, could incorporate the features described hereinbelow and that device would be within the spirit and scope of the present invention. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiment shown but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features described herein.</p>
    <p>In the following detailed description of the present invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be recognized by one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details or with equivalents thereof. In other instances, well known methods, procedures, components and circuits have not been described in detail as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the present invention.</p>
    <p>The present invention is an image processing architecture that is designed to input a large amount of image data from a data store, operate upon that data, and output the processed data to another data store. The actual processing may be performed by either software components, hardware components, or combinations of the two. The present invention is implemented in a digital camera operating system such as the Digita™ Operating Environment (OE) by FlashPoint Technology of San Jose, Calif.</p>
    <p>In the Digita OE, the data store may either be in memory or on disk. The exact nature of the data store can be hidden from the processing module by using a well designed programming interface. From the perspective of the Digita OE, data from either form can be delivered to the processing module in a well described manner, which does not require any software changes.</p>
    <p>For software components, the desire is to retrieve data into a buffer that can be referenced by the processing module. To accomplish this, the programming interface provides a routine that can be called to retrieve data from the data store. In the case of when the data store is in memory, this routine would copy the requested bytes of data from the data store memory into a memory buffer that can be referenced by the processing module. In the case of when the data store is on disk, this would read the data off disk into a memory buffer that can be referenced by the processing module.</p>
    <p>For hardware components, the desire is to retrieve data through a direct memory access (DMA) operation, where data are transferred across a bus by hardware. To support this mode, the programming interface provides a routine that can be called to retrieve a pointer to a buffer that contains the data. In the case of when the data store is in memory, this routine would simply return the address of the data store memory. In the case of when the data store is on disk, this routine would allocate a buffer, and read the data from disk into the newly allocated buffer, then return the address of the newly allocated buffer.</p>
    <p>Combinations of hardware and software components are compatible with this design. The key point is for the processing module to identify whether it will be accessing data through the functional interface or through a pointer to memory. The Digita OE can respond to both types of requests without requiring any software changes.</p>
    <p>Refer to FIG. 1, which is a block diagram of one embodiment of digital camera <b>100</b> for use in accordance with the present invention. Digital camera <b>100</b> preferably comprises imaging device <b>114</b>, system bus <b>116</b> and computer <b>110</b>.

In the preferred embodiment, CPU <b>344</b> is capable of concurrently running multiple software routines to control the various processes of digital camera <b>100</b> within a multi-threaded environment. For example, images may be captured at the same time that previously captured images are processed in the background to effectively increase the capture rate of the camera. In a preferred embodiment, CPU <b>344</b> runs an operating system capable of providing a menu-driven graphical user interface (GUI) and software image processing. An example of such software is the Digita™ Operating Environment by FlashPoint Technology of San Jose, Calif.</p>
    <p>Continuing with reference to FIG. 2, I/O <b>348</b> is an interface device allowing communications to and from computer <b>110</b>. For example, I/O <b>348</b> permits an external host computer (not shown) to connect to and communicate with computer <b>110</b>. I/O <b>348</b> also interfaces with a plurality of buttons and/or dials <b>404</b> and optional status liquid crystal display (LCD) <b>406</b> which, in addition to LCD screen <b>402</b>, are the hardware elements of the digital camera's user interface <b>408</b>.</p>
    <p>Non-volatile memory <b>350</b>, which may typically comprise a conventional read-only memory or flash memory, stores a set of computer-readable program instructions to control the operation of digital camera <b>100</b>. Removable memory <b>354</b> serves as an additional image data storage area and is preferably a non-volatile device, such as a Flash disk, that is readily removable and replaceable by the user of digital camera <b>100</b> via buffers/connector <b>352</b>.</p>
    <p>With reference still to FIG. 2, power supply <b>356</b> supplies operating power to the various components of digital camera <b>100</b>. Power manager <b>342</b> communicates via line <b>366</b> with power supply <b>356</b> and coordinates power management operations for digital camera <b>100</b>. In the preferred embodiment, power supply <b>356</b> provides operating power to main power bus <b>362</b> and also to secondary power bus <b>364</b>. Main power bus <b>362</b> provides power to imaging device <b>114</b>, I/O <b>348</b>, non-volatile memory <b>350</b> and removable memory <b>354</b>. Secondary power bus <b>364</b> provides power to power manager <b>342</b>, CPU <b>344</b> and DRAM <b>346</b>.</p>
    <p>Power supply <b>356</b> is connected to main batteries <b>358</b> and also to backup batteries <b>360</b>. In the preferred embodiment, a user of digital camera <b>100</b> user may also connect power supply <b>356</b> to an external power source. During normal operation of power supply <b>356</b>, main batteries <b>358</b> provide operating power to power supply <b>356</b> which then provides the operating power to digital camera <b>100</b> via both main power bus <b>362</b> and secondary power bus <b>364</b>. During a power failure mode in which main batteries <b>358</b> have failed (when their output voltage has fallen below a minimum operational voltage level), backup batteries <b>360</b> provide operating power to power supply <b>356</b> which then provides the operating power only to secondary power bus <b>364</b> of digital camera <b>100</b>.</p>
    <p>DRAM <b>346</b> is a contiguous block of dynamic memory that may be selectively allocated for various storage functions. DRAM <b>346</b> stores both raw and compressed image data and is also used by CPU <b>344</b> while executing the software routines used within computer <b>110</b>. The raw image data received from imaging device <b>114</b> are temporarily stored in several input buffers (not shown) within DRAM <b>346</b>. Once the raw image data are processed, the data are stored in a frame buffer (not shown) for display, on LCD screen <b>402</b>. Finally, LCD controller <b>390</b> accesses DRAM <b>346</b> and transfers processed image data to LCD screen <b>402</b> for display.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 3A and 3B are diagrams depicting the preferred hardware components of user interface <b>408</b> (FIG. 2) of digital camera <b>100</b>. FIG. 3A is a back view of digital camera <b>100</b> showing LCD screen <b>402</b>, four-way navigation control button <b>409</b>, overlay button <b>412</b>, menu button <b>414</b>, and a set of programmable soft keys <b>416</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 3B is a top view of digital camera <b>100</b> showing shutter button <b>418</b> and mode dial <b>420</b>. The digital camera may optionally include status LCD <b>406</b>, status LCD scroll button <b>422</b> and select button <b>424</b>, sound record button <b>426</b>, and zoom-in, zoom-out buttons <b>426</b> <i>a </i>and <b>426</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
    <p>With reference back to FIG. 3A, digital camera <b>100</b> is provided with several different operating modes for supporting various camera functions. The modes relevant to this description are capture or record mode for capturing images, and play mode for playing back the captured images on LCD screen <b>402</b>. In capture mode, digital camera <b>100</b> supports the actions of preparing to capture an image and of capturing an image. In review mode, digital camera <b>100</b> supports the actions of reviewing camera contents, editing and sorting images, and printing and transferring images. In play mode, digital camera <b>100</b> allows the user to view screen-sized images in the orientation that the image was captured. Play mode also allows the user to hear recorded sound associated to a displayed image, and to play back sequential groupings of images, which may comprise time lapse, slide show, and burst image images. The user preferably switches between the capture, review, and play modes.</p>
    <p>With reference still to FIG. 3A, to take a picture, digital camera <b>100</b> must be placed into capture mode. If LCD screen <b>402</b> is activated, then the camera displays to the user a “live view” of the object viewed through the camera lens on LCD screen <b>402</b> as a successive series of real-time frames. If LCD screen <b>402</b> is not activated, then the user may capture an image using a conventional optical viewfinder (not shown).</p>
    <p>Continuing with reference to FIG. 3A, during the execution of live view generation, frames of raw image data are sequentially captured by imaging device <b>114</b> (FIG. 2) at a reduced resolution suitable for LCD screen <b>402</b>, and the frames of raw image data are stored in DRAM <b>346</b> (FIG. <b>2</b>). The live view generation process then performs gamma correction and color conversion on the raw CCD data to convert the data into either a RGB or YCC color format which is compatible with LCD screen <b>402</b>. (RGB is an abbreviation for Red, Green, Blue, and YCC is an abbreviation for Luminance, Chrominance-red and Chrominance-blue.) The raw image data are also processed for extracting exposure, focus, and white balance settings, and the like. After converting each frame of data to YCC (typically, YCC 2:2:2 format), the YCC image data are transferred to LCD screen <b>402</b> for display.</p>
    <p>The live view frames generated during live view generation are displayed until the user decides to capture the image (i.e., take a picture). When the user presses the shutter button to capture an image, the imaged data are captured at a resolution set by the user, transformed into YCC 4:2:2 color space, compressed (e.g., JPEG), and stored as an image file. Live view then resumes to allow the capture of another image. The user may then either continue to capture images or switch digital camera <b>100</b> to play mode in order to play back and view the previously captured images on LCD screen <b>402</b>. In play mode, the user may also hear any recorded sound associated with a displayed image.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 4, a diagram of one embodiment of nonvolatile memory <b>350</b> of FIG. 2 is shown. Non-volatile memory <b>350</b> includes application program <b>371</b>, application program interface <b>372</b>, toolbox <b>373</b>, drivers <b>374</b>, hardware abstraction layer <b>375</b>, kernel <b>376</b>, and system configuration <b>377</b>.</p>
    <p>Application program <b>371</b> includes program instructions for controlling and coordinating the various functions of digital camera <b>100</b> (FIG. <b>2</b>). Different application programs may be preferably loaded by the user into digital camera <b>100</b> depending on the planned uses of the camera. Application program interface <b>372</b> defines a standard interface between application program <b>371</b> and toolbox <b>373</b>.</p>
    <p>Toolbox <b>373</b> contains the various software routines used to control the various processes of digital camera <b>100</b>. In general, toolbox <b>373</b> provides software routines for printing images, displaying images, organizing data, and the like. Toolbox <b>373</b> includes a menu and dialogue manager, which comprises software routines that are used to provide information for controlling access to camera control menus and camera control menu items. The menus, in turn, enable communication between digital camera <b>100</b> and the user, and provide the user with access to the features of digital camera <b>100</b>. Also included in toolbox <b>373</b> is a file formatter, consisting of software routines for creating an image file from processed image data, and a spooling manager.</p>
    <p>Drivers <b>374</b> are for controlling various hardware devices within digital camera <b>100</b>, such as the motors used to adjust the lens to change focus. Hardware abstraction layer (HAL) <b>375</b> defines a standard interface between toolbox <b>373</b>/drivers <b>374</b> and the implementation hardware specific to the make and model of the digital camera. Kernel <b>376</b> provides basic underlying services for the operating system of digital camera <b>100</b>. System configuration <b>377</b> performs initial start-up routines for digital camera <b>100</b>, including the boot routine and initial system diagnostics.</p>
    <p>Present Invention Architecture for Image Processing</p>
    <p>The present invention is a flexible architecture for image processing in a digital image device (e.g., digital camera <b>100</b>). As will be seen by the discussion below, the present invention permits the use of different modes of image processing while maintaining the same operating system, application program and application program interface (e.g., application program <b>371</b> and application program interface <b>372</b> of FIG. <b>4</b>). That is, the image processing mode used in a particular digital camera platform is invisible to the operating system and to application program <b>371</b>.</p>
    <p>The present invention accomplishes this by defining data structures that are flexible enough that different imaging processing subsystems can be implemented without affecting the software/hardware architecture that surrounds the subsystem. As will be seen, the present invention utilizes a well-defined interface that serves as a common point for entering and exiting the image processing subsystem without changing or perturbing the upstream and downstream elements of the digital camera.</p>
    <p>The present invention provides the framework in which image processing can be accomplished in three different modes, depending on the degree of hardware and software assistance associated with the particular digital camera platform. The first mode, referred to herein as the “software architecture,” implements an architecture that manages buffering within the architecture and that uses plug-in image processing modules. The second mode, referred to herein as the “software/hardware architecture,” supports the use of function calls to read in and write out data and utilizes hardware elements for image processing. The third mode, referred to herein as the “hardware architecture,” provides an address in memory for the input and output buffers in a direct memory access (DMA) environment, and uses an image processing hardware system. Each of these three modes are described in further detail below in conjunction with FIGS. 6 through 14.</p>
    <p>The present invention therefore provides a framework that enables image processing to be accomplished for different digital camera platforms. Hence, it is appreciated that the present invention may be implemented with image processing embodiments other than those described below.</p>
    <p>Software Architecture</p>
    <p>With reference now to FIG. 5, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, non-volatile memory <b>350</b> also contains image processing backplane <b>510</b>, which coordinates the functioning and communication of various image processing modules <b>520</b> and handles the data flow between these modules. Image processing modules <b>520</b> include selectable plug-in software routines that analyze and manipulate captured image data in a variety of ways, depending on the particular module(s) selected. In the present embodiment, three image processing modules are utilized. The first image processing module performs linearization, defect correction, and white balance. The second image processing module performs interpolation and color correction. The third image processing module performs sharpening and color space conversion. However, it is understood that different numbers and functions of image processing modules other than those just described may be used in accordance with the present invention.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 6, a block diagram of software architecture <b>600</b> is provided in accordance with the present invention. As explained above in conjunction with FIGS. 1 and 3A, when an image is captured by digital camera <b>100</b>, the raw image data (typically in CCD format, e.g., CCD data <b>605</b>) are stored in input buffers within DRAM <b>346</b>.</p>
    <p>In the present embodiment, image processing backplane <b>630</b> includes three plug-in image processing software modules IPM(1) <b>622</b>, IPM(2) <b>624</b> and IPM(3) <b>626</b>; however, it understood that a different number of image processing modules may be utilized in accordance with the present invention. Image processing backplane <b>630</b> also includes JPEG software <b>628</b>. It should be appreciated that encoding systems other than JPEG may be used with the present invention.</p>
    <p>The three image processing modules and JPEG software <b>628</b> function by reading lines of incoming data, processing the data, and then sending out lines of data. IPM(1) <b>622</b>, IPM(2) <b>624</b>, IPM(3) <b>626</b> and JPEG software <b>628</b> are loaded by image processing backplane <b>630</b> during startup of the digital camera. Image processing modules and JPEG software are well known in the art.</p>
    <p>Line reader <b>620</b> and line writer <b>650</b> manage the flow of data into and out of IPM(1) <b>622</b>, IPM(2) <b>624</b>, IPM(3) <b>626</b> and JPEG software <b>628</b>. In this embodiment, line reader <b>620</b> is a software element that provides a functional interface for retrieving lines of data from CCD data <b>605</b>. Image processing backplane <b>630</b> uses this interface to retrieve lines of data that are fed into IPM(1) <b>622</b>, which in turn feeds into IPM(2) <b>624</b>, which in turn feeds into IPM(3) <b>626</b>, which in turn feeds into JPEG software <b>628</b>. In the case where the digital camera has an orientation sensor and the image is captured with the camera rotated from a purely horizontal or vertical orientation, then line reader, <b>620</b> feeds the lines of data in a rotated fashion so that the image on the disk (e.g., removable memory <b>354</b> of FIG. 3A) is also rotated.</p>
    <p>In the present embodiment, water mark <b>980</b> includes software used to impress on the image data such information as the time and date. However, it is appreciated that in other embodiments of the present invention, the water marking function may not be used.</p>
    <p>Continuing with reference to FIG. 6, line writer <b>650</b> is a software element that writes lines of data to disk <b>660</b> (e.g., RAM disk or Flash disk).</p>
    <p>With reference now to FIG. 7, the data path through software architecture <b>600</b> is illustrated. Lines of data are fed through spooler <b>700</b>; as used herein, a spooler is a process or device for transferring data from one process or device to a second process or device. Spooler <b>700</b> is comprised of RAM disk <b>1</b> spooler <b>701</b>, Flash disk <b>1</b> spooler <b>702</b>, image processing spooler <b>703</b>, RAM disk <b>2</b> spooler <b>704</b> and Flash disk <b>2</b> spooler <b>705</b>; however, it is understood that a different spooler configuration may be used in accordance with the present invention. In accordance with the present invention, spooler <b>700</b> initializes line reader <b>620</b> and line writer <b>650</b>.</p>
    <p>The lines of data fed through spooler <b>700</b> can be from any source, e.g., the data can come from memory (e.g., an image buffer), from the RAM disk (as a file), or from the Flash disk (as a file). In accordance with the present invention, image processing spooler <b>703</b> is used to provide the data to line reader <b>620</b>. As indicated by the illustration, line reader <b>620</b>, image processing backplane <b>630</b>, JPEG software <b>628</b> and line writer <b>650</b> are situated below application program interface <b>372</b> on the data path. Hence, in accordance with the present invention, the image processing subsystem (e.g., image processing backplane <b>630</b> including JPEG software <b>628</b>) is invisible to the operating system and to application program <b>371</b> (FIG. <b>5</b>).</p>
    <p>Refer now to FIG. 8, which illustrates data structure <b>800</b> associated with software architecture <b>600</b>. Input buffer <b>810</b> is a buffer that is created and used only when data are not spooled, in which case the data are loaded from DRAM <b>346</b>. Otherwise, lines of image data are read by line reader <b>620</b> from, for example, a RAM disk or a Flash disk via spooler <b>700</b> as shown in FIG. <b>7</b>.</p>
    <p>The lines of data are read into input/output buffer <b>820</b>, which serves as the output buffer for line reader <b>620</b> and the input buffer for IPM(1) <b>622</b>. In the present embodiment, input/output buffer <b>820</b> can hold only one line of data. Thus, when the next line of data is received by input/output buffer <b>820</b>, the line of data already in that buffer is driven into IPM(1) <b>622</b>.</p>
    <p>After processing by IPM(1) <b>622</b> (e.g., linearization, defect correction, and white balance), the line of data is transferred to input/output buffer <b>830</b>, which serves as the output buffer for IPM(1) <b>622</b> and the input buffer for IPM(2) <b>624</b>. In the present embodiment, input/output buffer <b>830</b> is capable of holding up to five lines of data. The lines of data are not forwarded from input/output buffer <b>830</b> to IPM(2) <b>624</b> until the buffer is full. When the buffer is full, the next line of data received by input/output buffer <b>830</b> drives one line of data into IPM(2) <b>624</b>.</p>
    <p>After processing by IPM(2) <b>624</b> (e.g., interpolation and color correction), the line of data is transferred to input/output buffer <b>840</b>, which serves as the output buffer for IPM(2) <b>624</b> and the input buffer for IPM(3) <b>626</b>. In the present embodiment, input/output buffer <b>840</b> is capable of holding only one line of data. Thus, in the same manner as above, when the next line of data is received by input/output buffer <b>840</b>, the line of data already in that buffer is driven into IPM(3) <b>626</b>.</p>
    <p>After processing by IPM(3) <b>626</b> (e.g., sharpening and color space conversion), the line of data is transferred to input/output buffer <b>850</b>, which serves as the output buffer for IPM(3) <b>626</b> and the input buffer for JPEG software <b>628</b>. JPEG software <b>628</b> accepts lines of data as input. As data are buffered and processed through JPEG software <b>628</b>, a stream of bytes that represent compressed data is forwarded to file buffer <b>860</b> then to line writer <b>650</b>, which writes the data to, for example, the RAM disk or the Flash disk.</p>
    <p>Software/Hardware Architecture</p>
    <p>With reference now to FIG. 9, a block diagram of software/hardware architecture <b>900</b> is provided for a different image processing embodiment in accordance with the present invention. As explained above in conjunction with FIGS. 1 and 3A, when an image is captured by digital camera <b>100</b>, the raw image data (e.g., CCD data <b>605</b>) are stored in input buffers within DRAM <b>346</b>.</p>
    <p>In this embodiment, image processing backplane <b>630</b> includes a hybrid of software and hardware components. Relative to software architecture <b>600</b> (FIG. 6) described above, in software/hardware architecture <b>900</b> the software image processing modules are replaced by digital signal processor (DSP) <b>922</b> and the JPEG software is replaced by JPEG hardware <b>924</b>. Digital signal processors and JPEG hardware are well known in the art. It should be appreciated that encoding systems other than JPEG may be used with the present invention.</p>
    <p>In the present embodiment, water mark <b>980</b> includes software used to impress on the image data such information as the time and date. However, it is appreciated that in other embodiments of the present invention, the water marking function may not be used.</p>
    <p>The software elements line reader <b>620</b> and line writer <b>650</b> are retained, and they function as described above in conjunction with FIGS. 6, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>. These elements serve as part of the common interface between the operating system and the image processing subsystem that is independent of the mode of image processing that is used.</p>
    <p>With reference now to FIG. 10, the data path through software/hardware architecture <b>900</b> is illustrated. In the same manner as described for software architecture <b>600</b> (see discussion in conjunction with FIG. <b>7</b>), lines of data are fed through spooler <b>700</b>. The lines of data are from any source (e.g., memory, RAM disk, or Flash disk), and are fed using image processing spooler <b>703</b> to line reader <b>620</b>. The data can include thumbnail, screennail, or image information. In accordance with the present invention, spooler <b>700</b> initializes line reader <b>620</b> and line writer <b>650</b>.</p>
    <p>Continuing with reference to FIG. 10, hardware accelerator <b>1040</b> comprises DSP <b>922</b> and JPEG hardware <b>924</b> of FIG. <b>9</b>. Line reader <b>620</b>, hardware accelerator <b>1040</b>, and line writer <b>650</b> are situated below application program interface <b>372</b> on the data path. Hence, in accordance with the present invention, the image processing subsystem (e.g., hardware accelerator <b>1040</b>) is invisible to the operating system and to application program <b>371</b> (FIG. <b>5</b>).</p>
    <p>Refer now to FIG. 11, which illustrates data structure <b>1100</b> associated with software/hardware architecture <b>900</b>. Input buffer <b>1110</b> is a buffer that is created and used only when data are not spooled, in which case the data are loaded from DRAM <b>346</b>. Otherwise, in the same manner as described above in conjunction with software architecture <b>600</b> of FIG. 6, lines of data are read by line reader <b>620</b> from, for example, the RAM disk or the Flash disk via spooler <b>700</b> as shown in FIG. <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>The lines of data are read into input/output buffer <b>1120</b>, which serves as the output buffer for line reader <b>620</b> and the input buffer for DSP <b>922</b>. After processing by DSP <b>922</b>, the data are forwarded to ping-pong buffers A and B <b>1130</b> and from there to JPEG hardware <b>924</b>. DSP <b>922</b> and JPEG hardware <b>924</b> can be run in parallel (at the same time). Thus, one of the. ping-pong buffers (e.g., buffer A) is filled and the data therein are then fed to JPEG hardware <b>924</b>. JPEG hardware <b>924</b> operates on these data while the other ping-pong buffer (e.g., buffer B) is filled. When JPEG hardware <b>924</b> is finished with the data from buffer A, it begins to operate on the data in buffer B, and in the meantime buffer A is refilled. Water mark <b>980</b> is impressed on the image data in ping-pong buffers A and B <b>1130</b>.</p>
    <p>After processing by JPEG hardware <b>924</b>, the data are forwarded to input/output buffer <b>1140</b>, then to line writer <b>650</b>, which writes the data to, for example, the RAM disk or the Flash disk. Line writer <b>650</b> provides an interface between the image processing subsystem and the downstream elements of the digital camera that is independent of the image processing mode being used.</p>
    <p>Hardware Architecture</p>
    <p>With reference now to FIG. 12, a block diagram of hardware architecture <b>1200</b> is provided for a different image processing embodiment in accordance with the present invention. As explained above in conjunction with FIGS. 1 and 3A, when an image is captured by digital camera <b>100</b>, the raw image data (e.g., CCD data <b>605</b>) are stored in input buffers within DRAM <b>346</b>.</p>
    <p>In this embodiment, the image processing backplane uses only hardware (e.g., image processing backplane hardware <b>1230</b>) for image processing. Relative to software architecture <b>600</b> (FIG. 6) described above, in hardware architecture <b>1200</b> the software image processing modules and the JPEG software are replaced by an image processing hardware system. Relative to software/hardware architecture <b>900</b> (FIG. 9) described above, the software-assisted digital signal processor and JPEG hardware are replaced by an image processing hardware system. In addition, as will be described in detail below, the functions performed by line reader of hardware architecture <b>1200</b> are extended to include additional functions relative to line reader <b>620</b> of software architecture <b>600</b> and software/hardware architecture <b>900</b>.</p>
    <p>In this embodiment, CCD data <b>605</b> is read from memory using direct memory access (DMA) and processed by image processing backplane hardware <b>1230</b>. Image processing backplane hardware <b>1230</b> is exemplified by the image processing hardware system described in the patent application assigned to the assignee of the present invention and entitled “Image Processing System for High Performance Digital Imaging Devices;” by Eric C. Anderson; Ser. No. 09/081,694; Attorney Docket Number FSPT-P156; filed on May 19, 1998; and herein incorporated by reference. Other image processing hardware systems known in the art may also be used in accordance with the present invention.</p>
    <p>With reference now to FIG. 13, the data path through hardware architecture <b>1200</b> is illustrated. As stated above, hardware architecture <b>1200</b> is DMA-based. Lines of data are passed through spooler <b>700</b>; however, in this case, the stages of spooler <b>700</b> (specifically, RAM disk spooler <b>701</b> and Flash disk spooler <b>702</b>) are each turned off so that the data flow through the spooler without being spooled. Thus, the data are fed through spooler <b>700</b> very quickly and the associated latency is not significant. Lines of data are still read off of the third stage of spooler <b>700</b> (e.g., image processing spooler <b>703</b>). By retaining the spooler in hardware architecture <b>1200</b> in this manner, the same application program interface (e.g., application program interface <b>372</b>) is maintained and the image processing subsystem remains invisible to the operating system and to application program <b>371</b> (FIG. <b>5</b>).</p>
    <p>Refer now to FIG. 14, which illustrates data structure <b>1300</b> associated with hardware architecture <b>1200</b>. In this embodiment, data has to be in memory (e.g., DRAM <b>346</b>); thus, if the data are previously spooled, they must be despooled and brought back to memory. In accordance with the present invention, spooler <b>700</b> initializes line reader <b>1320</b> and line writer <b>650</b>.</p>
    <p>In this embodiment, the functions of line reader <b>1320</b> are extended relative to the functions of line reader <b>620</b> of software architecture <b>600</b> and software/hardware architecture <b>900</b> (FIGS. 6 and 9, respectively). Line reader <b>1320</b> functions to manage the data so that the data are properly located for processing. That is, line reader <b>1320</b> searches memory for the data and identifies the location of the image data to be processed. If the data are not in memory, then line reader <b>1320</b> directs memory to be allocated (e.g., input buffer <b>1310</b>), reads the data off of the disk (e.g., the RAM disk), and places the data in input buffer <b>1310</b>. Line reader <b>1320</b> thereby provides the memory location so that DMA channels can be set up. If the data are previously spooled, line reader <b>1320</b> directs that the data be despooled.</p>
    <p>Continuing with reference to FIG. 14, once input buffer <b>1310</b> is created by line reader <b>1320</b>, the digital camera's operating system then sets up DMA engine <b>1430</b> and output buffer <b>1350</b>, and executes image processing. Line writer <b>650</b> writes the data to the RAM disk, the Flash disk, or memory (e.g., DRAM <b>346</b>). Line writer <b>650</b> provides an interface between the image processing subsystem and the downstream elements of the digital camera that is independent of the image processing mode being used.</p>
    <p>If the water mark function is being used, the hardware operates in two phases with the water mark being impressed between the two phases. DMA engine <b>1430</b> sends data to and retrieves data from image processing backplane hardware <b>1230</b> in the first phase and places the partially processed data into water mark buffer <b>1340</b>. The water mark is placed on the data in water mark buffer <b>1340</b>. DMA engine <b>1430</b> then sends the data back to image processing backplane hardware <b>1230</b> for the second phase of processing. It is appreciated that other embodiments of the present invention may not use the water marking function.</p>
    <p>Method of Present Invention Architecture for Image Processing</p>
    <p>FIG. 15 is a flow chart illustrating process <b>1500</b> for implementing the present invention architecture for image processing (e.g., software architecture <b>600</b>, software/hardware architecture <b>900</b>, and hardware architecture <b>1200</b>). Process <b>1500</b> is implemented by the digital camera's operating system (e.g., Digita™) executed by CPU <b>344</b> of FIG. <b>2</b>. It should be appreciated that process <b>1500</b> is an exemplary process and that the present invention is not limited by the embodiment discussed below.</p>
    <p>In step <b>1510</b>, application program <b>371</b> initializes the spooler (e.g., spooler <b>700</b> of FIGS. 7, <b>10</b> and <b>13</b>).</p>
    <p>In step <b>1520</b>, spooler <b>700</b> initializes the line reader and the line writer (e.g., line reader <b>620</b>, line reader <b>1320</b>, and line writer <b>650</b> of FIGS. 8, <b>11</b> and <b>14</b>). To initialize the line reader, spooler <b>700</b> specifies, for example, the rows and columns of the input buffer, the Bayer pattern, the orientation of the data, and the address of the input buffer. To initialize the line writer, spooler <b>700</b> specifies the output buffer to be used or the file extension (for example, for the RAM disk, Flash disk, or some another location within the digital camera).</p>
    <p>In step <b>1530</b>, spooler <b>700</b> initializes the image processing subsystem and the data structure associated with the image processing mode. In accordance with the present invention, software architecture <b>600</b> and data structure <b>800</b>, software/hardware architecture <b>900</b> and data structure <b>1100</b>, or hardware architecture <b>1200</b> and data structure <b>1400</b> may be utilized. In the present embodiment, spooler <b>700</b> disables the RAM disk spooler and the Flash disk spooler (e.g., RAM disk <b>1</b> spooler <b>701</b> and Flash disk <b>1</b> spooler <b>702</b>) if hardware image processing is utilized.</p>
    <p>In step <b>1540</b>, the data are passed from the input buffer to spooler <b>700</b>. As described above, spooler <b>700</b> is used to spool the data for software architecture <b>600</b> and software/hardware architecture <b>900</b>, but the stages of spooler <b>700</b> are turned off in hardware architecture <b>1200</b>. However, by retaining spooler <b>700</b> in each of these architectures, process <b>1500</b> is sufficiently flexible to be used with each of these architectures.</p>
    <p>In step <b>1550</b>, spooler <b>700</b> and the image processing subsystem are executed to convert raw image data into a compressed image file. The image processing subsystem used is either the software implementation of software architecture <b>600</b>, the software/hardware implementation of software/hardware architecture <b>900</b>, or the hardware implementation of hardware architecture <b>1200</b>. In this embodiment, spooler <b>700</b> spools the data according to which of its stages are turned on, forwards data to the line reader, and directs the image processing subsystem to being processing. The process data are then written to memory, the RAM disk, or the Flash disk.</p>
    <p>In summary, the present invention is a flexible architecture for image processing within a digital image device such as a digital camera. The present invention permits the use of different types of image processing subsystems within a single operating system. The type of image processing subsystem is invisible to the particular operating system and application program, and in effect one image processing subsystem could be swapped out and another swapped in without the operating system and application program having to recognize that a change occurred.</p>
    <p>The present invention provides the framework in which the image processing can be accomplished using software, hardware, or a combination of software and hardware. The present invention accomplishes this by defining data structures that are flexible enough that different imaging processing subsystems can be implemented without affecting the software/hardware architecture that surrounds the subsystem. The present invention utilizes a well-defined interface that suitably provides a common point for entering and exiting the image processing subsystem without changing or perturbing the upstream and downstream elements of the digital camera (conversely, the interface provides a common point at which the image processing subsystem taps into the data path of the digital camera without perturbing the data path). Thus, the present invention provides an operating system that can be used with an digital camera platform and is adaptable for use with foreseeable platforms.</p>
