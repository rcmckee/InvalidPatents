Using a guide catheter, a guidewire is delivered to a site proximal to the lesion. An aspiration catheter is then introduced over the guidewire, and the two are moved together in a distal to proximal direction across the occlusion. The aspiration catheter is then moved in a proximal to distal direction while continuously aspirating, which prevents embolization of any particles which may be created during the crossing of the guidewire.</div>

<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
  <p num="p-0004">The present invention relates generally to an improved method for reducing distal embolization during treatment of emboli, thrombi and other types of occlusions in the human arterial or venous system. The method is particularly well suited for use when treating stenoses or occlusions within saphenous vein grafts, coronary arteries, cerebral arteries and similar vessels.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
  <p num="p-0006">Human blood vessels often become occluded or completely blocked by plaque, thrombi, emboli or other substances, which reduces the blood carrying capacity of the vessel. Should the blockage occur at a critical location in the circulation, serious and permanent injury, or death, can occur. To prevent this, some form of medical intervention is usually performed when significant occlusion is detected, such as during an acute myocardial infarction (AMI).</p>
  <p num="p-0007">Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States and a common occurrence worldwide. Damage to or malfunction of the heart is caused by narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries (atherosclerosis) that supply blood to the heart. The coronary arteries are first narrowed and may eventually be completely blocked by plaque, and may further be complicated by the formation of thrombi (blood clots) on the roughened surfaces of the plaques. AMI can result from atherosclerosis, especially from an occlusive or near occlusive thrombus overlying or adjacent to the atherosclerotic plaque, leading to death of portions of the heart muscle. Thrombi and emboli also often result from myocardial infarction, and these clots can block the coronary arteries, or can migrate further downstream, causing additional complications.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">Various types of intervention techniques have been developed which facilitate the reduction or removal of the blockage in the blood vessel, allowing increased blood flow through the vessel. One technique for treating stenosis or occlusion of a blood vessel is balloon angioplasty. A balloon catheter is inserted into the narrowed or blocked area, and the balloon is inflated to expand the constricted area. In many cases, near normal blood flow is restored. It can be difficult, however, to treat plaque deposits and thrombi in the coronary arteries, because the coronary arteries are small, which makes accessing them with commonly used catheters difficult.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">Other types of intervention include atherectomy, deployment of stents, introduction of specific medication by infusion, and bypass surgery. Each of these methods is not without the risk of embolism caused by the dislodgment of the blocking material which then moves downstream. In addition, the size of the blocked vessel may limit percutaneous access to the vessel.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">There is a need for an improved method of reducing distal embolization during treatment of occluded vessels that can be performed regardless of the size of the blood vessel.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0011">Described below is an improved method for preventing distal embolization during removal of plaque, thrombi or other occlusions from a blood vessel. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, aspiration is performed while advancing a guidewire across the site of the occlusion in a proximal to distal direction to prevent distal embolization. An aspiration catheter is delivered over the guidewire until the distal ends of the guidewire and aspiration catheter are just proximal to the site of the occlusion. While aspirating, the occlusion in the vessel is crossed with both the guidewire and the catheter in a proximal to distal direction. In a preferred embodiment, the distal tip of the aspiration catheter is no more than 2 cm, more preferably no more than 0.5-1 cm, behind or proximal to the distal tip of the guidewire during crossing. The distal end of the aspiration catheter is then moved back across the occlusion, while continuously aspirating, to ensure the removal of any particles which may be created during the delivery of the guidewire to a position distal to at least a portion of the occlusion. Aspiration from proximal to distal, and distal to proximal, can be repeated as many times as necessary to completely aspirate all particles. These steps are all performed prior to any occlusion of the vessel using an occlusive device at a site distal to the occlusion, and treatment of the occlusion, as described below.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">In another preferred embodiment of the invention, a guidewire having an occlusive device on its distal end is advanced across the occlusion such that the occlusive device is distal to the occlusion, where it is then actuated. An aspiration catheter is delivered over the guidewire to a location proximal to the occlusion. Delivery of the aspiration catheter can occur before or after actuation of the occlusive device. While the occlusive device is actuated, the distal end of the aspiration catheter is moved in a proximal to distal direction across at least a portion of the occlusion while aspirating at the same time. Alternatively, aspiration may begin after the distal end of the aspiration catheter is moved distal to at least a portion of the occlusion, and the aspiration catheter may be moved in a distal to proximal direction. Furthermore, regardless of whether aspiration begins proximal or distal to the occlusion, aspiration may continue in both proximal to distal and distal to proximal directions and repeated as necessary to completely aspirate particles.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">The aspiration method disclosed herein can be used in any vessel of the body where the pressure is at least 0.2 psi at any time during the diastolic/systolic cycle of the heart, and, preferably, is about 1.2 psi, and is capable of providing a flow rate of at least 5 cc/minute when not occluded. Thus, although the pressure within any vessel may fall below 0.2 psi during relaxation between heartbeats, so long as the pressure created by the heartbeat rises to at least 0.2 psi, the pressure within the vessel will be sufficient.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">The present method is particularly suited for use following myocardial infarction, and in removal of occlusions from saphenous vein grafts, coronary and carotid arteries, and vessels having similar pressures and flow.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">In a preferred embodiment of the method of the present invention, a guide catheter is first introduced into the patient's vasculature through an incision made in the femoral artery in the groin and is used to guide the insertion of other catheters and devices to the desired site. A guidewire is then advanced until its distal end reaches a site proximal to the occlusion. Fluoroscopy is typically used to guide the guidewire and other devices to the desired location within the patient. The devices are frequently marked with radiopaque markings to facilitate visualization of the insertion and positioning of the devices within the patient's vasculature.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">In contrast to previous methods, in one embodiment the guidewire does not cross the occlusion prior to aspiration with an aspiration catheter or other suitable catheter which can provide aspiration pressure. Instead, an aspiration catheter is inserted over the guidewire and the two are concomitantly moved past the occlusion, proximal to distal, while aspirating, to prevent material which dislodges or breaks off the occlusion from entering the vasculature and producing distal emboli.</p>
  <p num="p-0017">A guidewire having an occlusive device on its distal end is preferably used in the present method. The method can be effectively carried out, however, using a number of guidewires or catheters that perform the function of occluding the vessel and allowing for the slidable insertion of various other catheters and devices. A standard guidewire can also be used to initially cross the occlusion, and then exchanged with a guidewire having an occlusive device at its distal end. When the standard guidewire is used, it may also be delivered with the aspiration catheter so that both are moved past the occlusion while aspirating. The occlusive device should be capable of preventing the migration of particles and debris from the working area, either through total or partial occlusion of the vessel. The occlusion of the vessel need not be complete.</p>
  <p num="p-0018">As the guidewire and aspiration catheter cross the occlusion, blood enters the vessel and keeps any particles dislodged during the procedure from flowing in a distal to proximal direction. In addition, the blood pressure and flow provides the irrigation necessary for aspiration.</p>
  <p num="p-0019">After the distal end of the guidewire having an occlusive device is delivered past the site of the occlusion and aspiration is complete, the occlusive device is activated, preventing particles and debris from travelling downstream. Therapy can then be performed to remove or reduce the occlusion. A therapy catheter can be used if desired. The therapy catheter can be any of a number of devices, including a balloon catheter used to perform angioplasty, a catheter which delivers a stent, a catheter for delivering enzymes, chemicals, or drugs to dissolve and treat the occlusion, an atherectomy device, or a laser or ultrasound device used to ablate the occlusion. Alternatively, the therapy catheter can be eliminated and use of the guide catheter or the aspiration catheter alone can be used to aspirate the occlusion. This method is especially useful to remove emboli from the coronary arteries following acute myocardial infarction, because the aspiration catheter can be made small enough to enter the coronary arteries.</p>
  <p num="p-0020">Once the desired therapy is performed, the therapy catheter is withdrawn from the patient's body and the aspiration catheter can once again be delivered over the guidewire if desired to remove any particles or debris created during therapy.</p>
  <p num="p-0021">The method described herein provides an improved method for reducing distal embolization during treatment of emboli, thrombi and other types of occlusions in the human arterial or venous system, and is especially useful following myocardial infarction.</p>

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p num="p-0076">The present invention involves a method for advancing a guidewire into position in the vasculature of a patient prior to therapy on plaque, a thrombus, emboli, or other occluding substance. The preferred devices used during the method will be described first, followed by a description of the preferred method of use.</p>
  <heading>I. Overview of Occlusion System</heading> <p num="h-0007">A. Syringe Assembly</p>
  <p num="p-0077">The preferred embodiments of the present invention may comprise or be used in conjunction with a syringe assembly such as that generally illustrated in FIG. <b>1</b>. Also shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an illustrative connection of the syringe assembly <b>50</b> to an occlusion balloon guidewire catheter <b>70</b> utilizing an inflation adapter <b>54</b>. The syringe assembly <b>50</b>, comprising the inflation syringe <b>60</b> and a larger capacity or reservoir syringe <b>62</b>, is attached via tubing <b>64</b> to the inflation adapter <b>54</b> within which a low profile catheter valve <b>66</b> and the balloon catheter <b>70</b> are engaged during use.</p>
  <p num="p-0078">The catheter valve <b>66</b>, described in more detail below in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, is attached to an open proximal end of the catheter <b>70</b>. The low volume syringe <b>60</b> is used to inject inflation fluid through the adapter <b>54</b> and valve <b>66</b> into a lumen of the hollow catheter <b>70</b>, and into the balloon <b>72</b>. The inflation adapter <b>54</b>, described in more detail below in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, is used to open and close the valve <b>66</b> to regulate the inflation of the balloon <b>72</b> mounted on the distal end of the catheter <b>70</b>. Nevertheless, it will be emphasized that other types of adapters and/or valves can be employed with the inflation syringe and/or syringe assembly described herein, in order to achieve rapid and accurate inflation/deflation of medical balloons or other non-balloon medical devices. Therefore, although the present inflation is illustrated in connection with a low volume occlusion balloon <b>72</b>, other types of balloons and non-balloon devices can benefit from the advantages of the inflation described herein.</p>
  <p num="p-0079">The balloon <b>72</b> is mounted on a distal end of a hollow guidewire <b>70</b> which defines the inflation lumen for the balloon <b>72</b>, and the syringe <b>60</b> and/or syringe assembly <b>50</b> is connected at the proximal control end <b>33</b> of the guidewire <b>70</b>. Prior to use of the low volume syringe <b>60</b> to inflate the balloon <b>72</b> to the proper size for the vascular segment to be treated, the guidewire <b>70</b> and balloon <b>72</b> are first “primed” or evacuated. The reservoir syringe <b>62</b> of the assembly <b>50</b> may be used for the evacuation.</p>
  <p num="h-0008">B. Occlusion Balloon Guidewire</p>
  <p num="p-0080">The occlusion balloon/guidewire system generally illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> performs the function of occluding a vessel and allowing for the slidable insertion or advancement of various other catheters and devices. The term “catheter” as used herein is therefore intended to include both guidewires and catheters with these desired characteristics. The term “occlusion” refers to both partial and total occlusion of a vessel.</p>
  <p num="p-0081">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a balloon guidewire catheter <b>70</b> generally comprises an elongate flexible tubular body <b>80</b> extending between a proximal control end <b>82</b>, corresponding to a proximal section of the tubular body <b>80</b>, and a distal functional end <b>84</b>, corresponding to a distal section of tubular body <b>80</b>. Tubular body <b>80</b> has a central lumen <b>86</b>, which extends between ends <b>82</b> and <b>84</b>. An inflation port <b>90</b> is provided on tubular body <b>80</b> near the proximal end <b>82</b>. Inflation port <b>90</b> is in fluid communication with lumen <b>86</b> such that fluid passing through inflation port <b>90</b> into or out of lumen <b>86</b> may be used to inflate or deflate an inflatable balloon <b>72</b> in communication with lumen <b>86</b>. Further details are disclosed in assignee's application entitled LOW PROFILE CATHETER VALVE AND INFLATION ADAPTER, application Ser. No. 08/975,723, filed Nov. 20, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,050,972, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
  <p num="p-0082">The length of tubular body <b>80</b> may be varied considerably depending on the desired application. For example, when catheter <b>70</b> serves as a guidewire for other catheters in a conventional percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty procedure involving femoral artery access, tubular body <b>80</b> is comprised of a hollow hypotube having a length in the range from about 160 to about 320 centimeters, with a length of about 180 centimeters being optimal for a single operator device, or 300 centimeters for over the wire applications. Alternatively, for a different treatment procedure not requiring as long a length of tubular body <b>80</b>, shorter lengths of tubular body <b>80</b> may be provided.</p>
  <p num="p-0083">Tubular body <b>80</b> generally has a circular cross-sectional configuration with an outer diameter within the range from about 0.008 inches to 0.14 inches. In applications where catheter <b>70</b> is to be used as a guidewire for other catheters, the outer diameter of tubular body <b>80</b> ranges from 0.010 inches to 0.038 inches and preferably is about 0.014 to 0.020 inches in outer diameter or smaller. Noncircular cross-sectional configurations of lumen <b>86</b> can also be adapted for use with the catheter <b>70</b>. For example, triangular, rectangular, oval and other noncircular cross-sectional configurations are also easily incorporated for use with the present invention, as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art. The tubular body <b>80</b> may also have variable cross-sections.</p>
  <p num="p-0084">The tubular body <b>80</b> has sufficient structural integrity or “pushability” to permit catheter <b>70</b> to be advanced through the vasculature of a patient to distal arterial locations without buckling or undesirable kinking of tubular body <b>80</b>. It is also desirable for the tubular body <b>80</b> to have the ability to transmit torque such as in those embodiments where it may be desirable to rotate tubular body <b>80</b> after insertion into a patient. A variety of biocompatible materials known by those of skill in the art to possess these properties and to be suitable for catheter manufacture may be used to produce tubular body <b>80</b>. For example, tubular body <b>80</b> may be made of a stainless steel material such as ELGILOY™, or may be made of polymeric material such as PEEK, nylon, polyimide, polyamide, polyethylene or combinations thereof. In one preferred embodiment, the desired properties of structural integrity and torque transmission are achieved by forming the tubular body <b>80</b> out of an alloy of titanium and nickel, commonly referred to as nitinol. In a more preferred embodiment, the nitinol alloy used to form the tubular body <b>80</b> is comprised of about 50.8% nickel and the balance titanium, which is sold under the trade name TINEL™ by Memry Corporation. It has been found that a catheter tubular body having this composition of nickel and titanium exhibits an improved combination of flexibility and kink resistance in comparison to other materials. Other details regarding construction of catheter <b>70</b> may be found in assignee's applications entitled HOLLOW MEDICAL WIRES AND METHODS OF CONSTRUCTING SAME, application Ser. No. 08/812,876, filed Mar. 6, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,068,623, SHAFT FOR MEDICAL CATHETERS, application Ser. No. 09/026,105, filed Feb. 19, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,228,072, and FLEXIBLE CATHETER, application Ser. No. 09/253,591, filed Feb. 22, 1999, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
  <p num="p-0085">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an expandable member such as inflatable balloon <b>72</b> is mounted on the distal end <b>84</b> of tubular body <b>80</b>. In one preferred embodiment, balloon <b>72</b> is a compliant balloon formed of a material comprising a block polymer of styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS), as disclosed in assignee's application entitled BALLOON CATHETER AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURE, application Ser. No. 09/026,225, filed on Feb. 19, 1998, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference. The balloon <b>72</b> may be secured to the tubular body <b>80</b> by any means known to those skilled in the art, such as adhesives or heat bonding. For example, for attachment of a SEBS balloon to a nitinol tube, a primer such as 7701 LOCTITE (TM) by Loctite Corporation is preferably used along with cyanoacrylate adhesive such as LOCTITE-4011.</p>
  <p num="p-0086">The balloon <b>72</b> described in the preferred embodiments preferably has a length of about 5 to 9 mm and more preferably about 6-8 mm. Other expandable members are suitable for the catheter <b>70</b>, such as those disclosed in assignee's application entitled OCCLUSION OF A VESSEL, application Ser. No. 09/026,106, filed Feb. 19, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,312,407, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
  <p num="p-0087">With next reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, a core wire <b>140</b> is provided inside the lumen <b>86</b>. Coils <b>132</b> extend from the distal end of the balloon <b>72</b>, surround the core wire <b>130</b>, and terminate in a distal ball <b>134</b>. In one embodiment, the core wire may have one or more tapers, and can extend proximally into tubular body <b>80</b>. Other details regarding the core wire are discussed in assignee's application entitled CATHETER CORE WIRE, Ser. No. 09/253,971, filed Feb. 22, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,355,016, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
  <p num="p-0088">In one embodiment, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, the tubular body <b>80</b> preferably has cuts <b>140</b> to create a coiled configuration. A sleeve <b>142</b> is preferably provided over the tubular body <b>80</b>. Adhesive stops <b>144</b> and <b>146</b> are provided about 1-2 mm from the ends of the balloon, as described above, to control the wicking length of the adhesive <b>148</b> into the balloon working area. Balloon inflation is provided through the cuts <b>140</b> in the tubular body <b>80</b>. A marker <b>150</b> is mounted to the tubular body <b>80</b> proximal of the balloon <b>72</b>. Adhesive tapers <b>152</b>A, <b>152</b>B and <b>154</b> are provided adjacent the balloon <b>72</b> to provide a transition region between the tubular body <b>80</b> and balloon <b>72</b> at the balloon's proximal end <b>72</b>A and between the balloon <b>72</b> and the core wire <b>328</b> at the balloon's distal end <b>72</b>B. Other details regarding this balloon catheter may be found in assignee's above-referenced copending application FLEXIBLE CATHETER.</p>
  <p num="h-0009">C. Introducer Arrangement</p>
  <p num="p-0089">The catheter <b>70</b> and balloon <b>72</b> assembly preferably access the vascular site through a port in the patient obtained, for example, using an introducer arrangement <b>200</b>, as depicted in FIG. <b>4</b>. As shown, a guide catheter <b>202</b> is inserted into a blood vessel <b>204</b> through an optional arterial sheath <b>206</b>. The arterial sheath <b>206</b> is inserted into the blood vessel through the skin <b>208</b>. A Y-adaptor <b>210</b> is connected to the proximal end of the guiding catheter <b>202</b>. A hemostasis valve or a Touhy-Borst valve is installed within the Y-adaptor to prevent blood flow. A protective sheath assembly <b>212</b> accommodates the distal end of the catheter <b>70</b>, including a surgical balloon <b>72</b>, within the assembly. The protective sheath assembly <b>212</b> is then inserted into the Y-adaptor <b>210</b> with the distal end of the assembly <b>212</b> passing the hemostasis valve mounted in the Y-adaptor <b>210</b>. As known in the art, the hemostasis valve maintains a tight seal around the protective sheath assembly <b>212</b> in order to prevent blood under arterial pressure from bleeding through the valve.</p>
  <p num="p-0090">Referring also to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the protective sheath assembly <b>212</b> has three major parts: a protective sheath <b>220</b>, a female luer lock <b>222</b>, and a strain-relief tubing <b>224</b>. The protective sheath <b>220</b> has an elongated tubular body <b>226</b> defining an elongated lumen <b>230</b> along a longitudinal axis <b>232</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0091">The lumen <b>230</b> can be further divided into two portions, the proximal portion <b>230</b> <i>b </i>starting from the proximal end <b>234</b> and the distal portion <b>230</b> <i>a </i>starting from the distal end <b>236</b> and extending over a relatively large part of the protective sheath <b>220</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0092">The dimension of lumen <b>230</b> at the proximal portion <b>230</b> <i>b </i>may vary depending on the outer diameter of the guidewire to be used. The inner diameter and the length of the proximal portion <b>230</b> <i>b </i>of lumen <b>230</b> is designed so that the guidewire can be moved smoothly through the lumen <b>230</b> while providing a good seal between the guidewire and the lumen <b>230</b> so as to prevent, or minimize, back flow of blood under arterial pressure. The dimension of the distal portion <b>230</b> <i>a </i>of lumen <b>230</b>, including the length and the inner diameter, may vary depending on the sizes of the balloon. However, the distal portion <b>230</b> <i>a </i>should be large enough to accommodate and protect the balloon, as well as the soft tip of a balloon catheter, or other fixed wire devices.</p>
  <p num="p-0093"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a broken side cross-sectional view of the sheath assembly of FIG. <b>5</b> and further illustrates, in dotted lines, a catheter <b>70</b> positioned within the lumen <b>230</b> of the protective sheath <b>220</b>. Specifically, the catheter <b>70</b> comprises a guidewire extending from the proximal end <b>234</b> of the sheath <b>220</b> and toward the distal end <b>236</b>. The medical balloon <b>72</b>, which is mounted on the distal end of the catheter <b>70</b>, is housed protectively within the distal portion <b>230</b> <i>a </i>of the sheath <b>220</b>. It will be noted that the guidewire <b>70</b> is housed snugly in the proximal portion <b>230</b> <i>b </i>of the lumen in order to prevent or at least minimize back blood flow under arterial pressure. The longitudinal position of the balloon is not particularly important so long as it is protectively contained within the lumen <b>230</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0094">In a method of the present invention, the proximal end of the guidewire is loaded into the sheath <b>220</b> beginning at the distal end <b>236</b>. This loading is facilitated by a transition section <b>240</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, located between the distal section <b>230</b> <i>a </i>and the proximal section <b>230</b> <i>b </i>of the lumen <b>230</b>. This lumen transition <b>240</b> between the proximal portion <b>230</b> <i>a </i>and the distal portion <b>230</b> <i>b </i>should be smooth to assist the loading of a balloon guidewire.</p>
  <p num="p-0095">Further details and alternative preferred embodiments of introducer arrangements that may be used in conjunction with the present invention are described in assignee's U.S. application Ser. No. 09/047,303, filed on Mar. 24, 1998, entitled MEDICAL WIRE INTRODUCER AND BALLOON PROTECTIVE SHEATH, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,997,562, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety</p>
  <p num="h-0010">D. Low Profile Catheter and Inflation Adapter</p>
  <p num="p-0096">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the syringe assembly <b>50</b> is connected to the occlusion balloon guidewire catheter <b>70</b> utilizing an inflation adapter <b>54</b>. The balloon guidewire catheter <b>70</b> has a side-access inflation port <b>90</b> and a low profile catheter valve <b>66</b> attached to its proximal end (see FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B).</p>
  <p num="p-0097">In one embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, the low profile catheter valve <b>66</b> comprises a movable sealer portion <b>110</b> attached at a distal end of a wire segment <b>112</b> and positioned within the inflation lumen <b>86</b> of the guidewire catheter <b>70</b>. The wire <b>112</b> may be secured to a spring just within a proximal opening of the catheter <b>70</b>. It will be noted that various spring or biasing arrangements may be utilized, including a zig-zag wire <b>114</b> which is formed on or replaces the wire segment <b>112</b> and which provides biasing force to the sealer portion <b>110</b> due to frictional engagement with the walls of the lumen <b>86</b>. The sealer portion <b>110</b> forms a fluid tight seal with the inflation lumen <b>86</b> by firmly contacting the entire circumference of a section of the inflation lumen <b>86</b>. The sealer portion <b>110</b> may be positioned proximally of the side-access inflation port <b>90</b> on the catheter as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, to establish an unrestricted fluid pathway between the inflation port <b>90</b> and the inflatable balloon on the distal end. As desired, the clinician may move the sealer portion <b>110</b> to a position at or distal of the inflation port <b>90</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, thereby preventing any fluid from being introduced into or withdrawn from the lumen <b>86</b> via the inflation port <b>90</b>. The valve <b>66</b> is considered “low profile” because it is no larger in cross-sectional diameter than the catheter <b>70</b> itself. The low profile catheter valve <b>66</b> is described in more detail in the above-referenced application LOW PROFILE CATHETER VALVE AND INFLATION ADAPTER.</p>
  <p num="p-0098">As discussed above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the inflation port <b>90</b>, proximal end of the catheter <b>70</b> and distal end of the valve <b>66</b> are positioned within the inflation adapter <b>54</b> (see FIG. <b>8</b>), to which the syringe assembly <b>50</b> is operably coupled via tubing <b>64</b>. The syringe <b>60</b> is used to inject inflation fluid through the adapter <b>54</b> and valve <b>66</b> into the lumen <b>86</b> of the hollow catheter <b>70</b>, and into the balloon <b>72</b>. The inflation adapter <b>54</b> is used to open and close the valve <b>66</b> to regulate the inflation of the balloon <b>72</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0099">Referring next to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the inflation adapter <b>54</b> comprises a housing having two halves <b>94</b>, <b>96</b> preferably formed of metal, medical grade polycarbonate, or the like. The halves <b>94</b>, <b>96</b> are attached by hinges <b>98</b> to be separated or joined in a clam shell manner. A locking clip <b>100</b> secures the halves while the adapter <b>54</b> is in use. A groove <b>97</b> and clips <b>99</b> within the housing accept and securely hold the catheter <b>70</b> in a correct position. The male luer member <b>92</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) or another suitable connector, extends from a top of the housing to provide an inflation passageway. Seals <b>102</b> are provided within the housing and around an internal segment <b>104</b> of the inflation pathway to conduct the pressurized fluid provided by the syringe assembly <b>50</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0100">An actuator <b>118</b>, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> at the top of the adapter housing <b>94</b>, controls a cam which operates sliding panels <b>120</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) contained in the housing. Preferably, the catheter <b>70</b> is positioned within the housing with the valve closed (FIG. <b>7</b>B), such that the side inflation port <b>90</b> is located in the sealed inflation area <b>104</b> of the housing. The catheter <b>70</b> is then positioned in the second half <b>96</b> of the adapter <b>54</b>. A distal portion of the catheter <b>70</b> extends out of the housing and into the patient, and a proximal portion of the catheter including the catheter valve <b>66</b> extends out of the other side of the adapter <b>54</b>. The adapter is closed, the locking clip <b>100</b> is secured, and the syringe assembly <b>50</b> attached. The actuator <b>118</b> is moved from a first position to a second position, such that the sliding panels <b>120</b> within the housing cause the valve <b>66</b> to be in an open position to allow fluid flow through the inflation port <b>90</b> (FIG. <b>7</b>A). The syringe assembly <b>50</b> is then used to inflate the balloon <b>72</b>. Closing the valve <b>66</b> is accomplished by moving the actuator <b>118</b> from the second position back to the first position (FIG. <b>7</b>B), such that the balloon inflation is maintained.</p>
  <p num="p-0101">Other inflation adapter/inflation syringe assemblies may also be used. For instance, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the sliding panels <b>120</b> and sealer portion <b>104</b> of the adapter <b>54</b> may be arranged somewhat differently than shown in FIG. <b>8</b>. Also, the adapter <b>54</b> can have additional features, such as a safety lock provided on the actuator knob <b>70</b> to prevent accidental opening when the adapter is being used and the catheter valve is open. In addition, the adapter can be provided with an overdrive system to overdrive a sealing member into a catheter. Details of these features and other inflation assemblies may be found in assignee's applications LOW PROFILE CATHETER VALVE AND INFLATION ADAPTER, referenced above, SYRINGE AND METHOD INFLATING LOW PROFILE CATHETER BALLOONS, application Ser. No. 09/025,991, filed Feb. 19, 1998, now abandoned, and LOW VOLUME SYRINGE AND METHOD FOR INFLATING SURGICAL BALLOONS, application Ser. No. 09/195,796, filed Nov. 19, 1998, now abandoned, all of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
  <p num="p-0102">Other connectors or fittings, such as tubing, quick connects and Y-connectors, may also be used in conjunction with an inflation/deflation device having features in accordance with the present invention according to the particular application and available supply of equipment, as shown. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, for example, the inflation syringe <b>60</b> is connected via an injection cap <b>122</b> directly to the guidewire <b>70</b> to allow inflation of the balloon <b>72</b> on the catheter. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the inflation syringe <b>60</b> is connected via a short tubing <b>124</b> to a connector <b>126</b> which is in turn in fluid communication with the catheter <b>70</b>. Thus, a variety of inflation devices and techniques are available in connection with the inflation syringe <b>60</b> of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0103">Further details regarding the occlusion system and its use are disclosed in assignee's applications entitled ASPIRATION CATHETER, application Ser.

  <heading>II. Low Volume Syringe</heading> <p num="p-0104">An embodiment of a low volume syringe <b>60</b> is shown schematically in FIG. <b>12</b>. The type or size illustrated is a 0.5 cc tuberculin syringe, although other size syringes having capacity ranging between about 0.02 cc to 1.0 cc may be used. More preferably, the capacity of the low volume syringe is between about 0.25 to 0.50 cc. The resultant displacement required for delivery of about 0.1 cc of fluid is about 10 mm for a 0.25 cc syringe. Indicia <b>164</b> may be provided along the length of the exterior surface of a cylinder <b>166</b> for visual aid of the clinician during use. Nevertheless, as described below in more detail, a mechanism is advantageously provided on the syringe <b>160</b> in order to accurately gauge the inflation fluid intake and expulsion as well as regulate the speed and pressure of fluid injection, thereby providing a means for the clinician to safely and accurately perform the desired procedure.</p>
  <p num="p-0105">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, the cylindrical body <b>166</b> of the syringe <b>160</b> comprises a stop or flange <b>168</b> extending radially outward at a proximal end and preferably being attached at a distal end to an injection cap <b>170</b>. The distal end of the cylinder <b>166</b> has a nose portion <b>172</b> with a reduced diameter for connection with the injection cap <b>170</b>. A plunger <b>174</b> has a shaft <b>176</b> of appropriate length and a resilient piston <b>178</b> attached at its distal end. The shaft <b>176</b> is inserted in a central lumen <b>179</b> of the cylinder and the piston <b>178</b> provides sealing engagement with the inner surface of the cylinder <b>166</b>. The plunger <b>174</b> has a disk <b>58</b> at the proximal end of the shaft <b>176</b> for operation of the plunger <b>174</b>. A preferred source for unmodified, conventional syringes is Becton Dickinson &amp; Co. of Franklin Lakes, N.J.</p>
  <p num="p-0106">The injection cap <b>170</b> preferably comprises a modified female member of a luer type connector. A first end <b>182</b> of the cap has a proximal wall with an aperture corresponding to the outer diameter of the cylinder <b>166</b>, and a distal wall having an aperture corresponding to the outer diameter of the nose <b>172</b>. These apertures are used to mount the injection cap <b>170</b> on the syringe <b>60</b>. A threaded second end <b>184</b> of the cap can be screwed onto a male luer member, as in the example of FIG. <b>1</b>. Alternatively, a tubular segment <b>188</b> within the second end <b>184</b> of the cap may be directly attached to the control end of the guidewire <b>70</b> using a sleeve <b>190</b>, as with FIG. <b>10</b>. Other suitable cap configurations may also be used to facilitate coupling of the syringe to a guidewire or catheter to provide inflation of the balloon. One preferred source of the cap is Medical Disposables International, Inc. of West Conshohocken, Pa.</p>
  <p num="p-0107">Another preferred embodiment of the low volume syringe is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-18</figref>. The low-volume syringe <b>260</b> preferably has a capacity ranging between about 0.1 cc and about 10 cc, and more preferably a capacity between about 0.2 cc and about 2 cc. The syringe <b>260</b> includes an elongated hollow body or barrel <b>264</b> which is preferably generally cylindrical, but the body can have any desired shape or cross-section. The body <b>264</b> has a distal end <b>268</b> with an attachment portion <b>270</b> which can be connected to various medical components such as a catheter. The attachment portion <b>270</b>, for example, may include a nose <b>272</b>, an injection cap <b>274</b> and internal threads <b>276</b>, but it will be understood that the attachment portion can include any type of known connector to attach the syringe <b>260</b> to various types of medical components or instruments. The body <b>264</b> also includes a proximal end <b>280</b> with a flange <b>282</b> and an opening <b>284</b>. The opening <b>284</b> is preferably circular and generally aligned with a longitudinal axis extending through the center of the body <b>264</b>. The stop <b>282</b> also includes a radially outwardly extending annular ridge <b>288</b>. The ridge <b>288</b> preferably extends outwardly about 1/16 of an inch from the body <b>264</b> and the ridge preferably has a length of about ¼ of an inch, but the ridge can have any desired dimensions and configuration.</p>
  <p num="p-0108">With continued reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-18</figref>, the syringe <b>260</b> includes a plunger <b>290</b> which is sized and dimensioned to be at least partially positioned within the elongated body <b>264</b>. The plunger <b>290</b> includes an elongated shaft <b>292</b> which is generally circular in cross-section and is preferably constructed from material such as plastic and composites. The plunger <b>290</b> includes a distal end <b>294</b> which is positioned near the distal end <b>268</b> of the body <b>264</b> and a proximal end <b>296</b> which is positioned near the proximal end <b>280</b> of the body. The distal end <b>294</b> of the plunger <b>290</b> includes a piston <b>300</b> with a center section <b>302</b> and two outwardly extending annular flanges <b>304</b> and <b>306</b>, respectively. The annular flanges <b>304</b> and <b>306</b> extend outwardly and slidably engage the inner wall of the elongated body <b>264</b> to create a fluid-tight seal with the elongated body. The piston <b>300</b> is preferably constructed from a resilient material such as rubber, but it can be constructed from any material which is suitable for its intended purpose. It will be understood that the piston <b>300</b> may have any desired size and/or configuration.</p>
  <p num="p-0109">The plunger shaft <b>292</b> is generally cylindrical and has an annular notch <b>310</b> formed therein at a distance from the piston <b>300</b> of the shaft. A C-clip <b>312</b> is adapted to fit into the notch <b>310</b> and is sized to extend annularly outwardly from the shaft <b>292</b>, effectively creating a ridge encircling the shaft. A length of the shaft near the proximal end is split into two shaft legs <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>. A collapsible chamber <b>320</b> is defined between the legs <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>. Threads <b>322</b> are formed about the outer circumference of the legs <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0110">A hollow plunger guide <b>324</b> has a neck portion <b>326</b> formed at its distal end and is adapted to fit complementarily into the proximal opening <b>284</b> of the body. The plunger guide <b>324</b> is generally cylindrical and has threads <b>328</b> formed on its inner surface. The inner threads <b>328</b> of the plunger guide <b>324</b> are adapted to engage the outer threads <b>322</b> of the plunger legs <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> so that the plunger <b>290</b> may be threaded within the plunger guide <b>324</b>. As the plunger <b>290</b> is rotated, the threads <b>322</b>, <b>328</b> interact to advance or retract the plunger <b>290</b> within the syringe body, depending on the direction of rotation. The inner diameter of the hollow plunger guide's distal neck <b>326</b> is less than the diameter of the plunger's clip <b>312</b>. As such, the C-clip <b>312</b> cannot fit through the plunger guide neck <b>326</b>. Instead, retraction of the plunger <b>290</b> from the barrel <b>264</b> is stopped when the C-clip <b>312</b> contacts the plunger neck portion <b>326</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0111">Continuing with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-18</figref>, the proximal end <b>296</b> of the plunger <b>290</b> includes a handle <b>330</b> comprising a generally circular disk <b>332</b> that is mounted to the end of the shaft <b>292</b>. The disk <b>332</b> preferably has ridges <b>334</b> formed along an edge thereof, a diameter of about 1 inch, and a thickness of about ⅛ of an inch so that the clinician can easily grasp and rotate the handle <b>330</b>. However, the disk <b>332</b> can be larger or smaller and it can have any desired shape such as square, rectangular, triangular, etc.</p>
  <p num="p-0112">A plunger actuator <b>340</b> comprises a shaft <b>342</b> with a head <b>344</b> formed at its distal end and a tab <b>346</b> formed at its proximal end. The plunger actuator shaft <b>342</b> is adapted to fit through a hole <b>348</b> formed in the handle <b>330</b> of the plunger <b>290</b> and the head <b>344</b> is positioned within the collapsible chamber <b>320</b>. A spring <b>350</b> is disposed within the collapsible chamber <b>320</b> between the plunger actuator head <b>344</b> and a distal end <b>352</b> of the collapsible chamber <b>320</b>. The spring <b>350</b> biases the plunger actuator <b>340</b> in a proximal direction. The plunger actuator shaft <b>342</b> includes an annular protrusion <b>354</b> which contacts the plunger handle <b>330</b> to stop the plunger actuator <b>340</b> from being pushed by the spring <b>350</b> out of the collapsible chamber <b>320</b>. Thus, the head <b>344</b> of the plunger actuator <b>340</b> is biased by the spring <b>350</b> into a position between the legs <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> of the collapsible chamber <b>320</b> about medially between the chamber's proximal and distal ends, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>. In this position, the head <b>344</b> prevents the opposing legs <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> from collapsing toward each other. Thus, the chamber <b>320</b> is held in an “open” position.</p>
  <p num="p-0113">With particular reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 AND 16</figref>, when the collapsible chamber <b>320</b> is held open by the plunger actuator head <b>344</b>, the chamber outer threads <b>322</b> engage the inner threads <b>328</b> of the plunger guide <b>324</b>. Thus, the plunger <b>290</b> can be linearly moved relative to the barrel <b>264</b> only by rotating the handle <b>330</b>. When the handle <b>330</b> is rotated in the clockwise direction, the plunger <b>290</b> preferably moves toward the distal end <b>268</b> of the barrel <b>264</b>, thus ejecting the contents of the barrel <b>264</b> and inflating an associated surgical balloon. When the plunger <b>290</b> is rotated in the counterclockwise direction, the plunger <b>290</b> is preferably retracted into the barrel <b>264</b>, thus deflating the balloon.</p>
  <p num="p-0114">When the plunger actuator tab <b>346</b> is pushed, the plunger actuator <b>340</b> compresses the spring <b>350</b> and moves the head <b>344</b> out of supportive contact with the collapsible chamber legs <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>. Thus, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>, the chamber legs <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> collapse toward each other and the chamber's outer threads <b>322</b> move out of engagement with the plunger guide inner threads <b>328</b>. In this condition, the plunger <b>290</b> may be linearly moved relative to the barrel <b>264</b> by simply pushing or pulling the handle <b>330</b> in the same manner as conventional plungers.</p>
  <p num="p-0115">In use, the syringe <b>260</b> is preferably first oriented in the open position and the plunger <b>290</b> is retracted as shown in FIG. <b>15</b>. The hollow body <b>264</b> between the distal end <b>268</b> and the piston <b>300</b> is preferably filled with inflation fluid. The handle <b>330</b> is then rotated, thus advancing the plunger <b>290</b> and delivering the fluid in a regulated, pressure-controlled manner. When the fluid is fully delivered, the syringe <b>260</b> is in the position depicted in FIG. <b>16</b> and the surgical balloon is inflated</p>
  <p num="p-0116">To quickly deflate the balloon, the plunger actuator <b>340</b> is depressed, allowing the chamber <b>320</b> to collapse as shown in FIG. <b>17</b>. While the plunger actuator <b>340</b> remains depressed, the clinician pulls on the handle <b>330</b>, slidably retracting the plunger <b>290</b> as shown in FIG. <b>18</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0117"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref> show a preferred embodiment of an integrated inflation/deflation syringe <b>260</b> <i>a </i>having a variable cross-section barrel <b>264</b> <i>a</i>. The syringe shares many similarities with the embodiment just discussed and shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-18</figref>. Thus, similar parts have been assigned the same numbers used above, but including the appellation “a.” The similar parts function in substantially the same manner as described above.</p>
  <p num="p-0118">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>, the variable cross-section barrel <b>264</b> <i>a </i>has a large diameter portion <b>265</b> and a small diameter portion <b>266</b>. The large diameter portion <b>265</b> has a cross-section about the same as that of a standard 30-60 cc syringe. The small diameter portion <b>266</b> has a cross-section about the same as the low-volume syringe barrel <b>264</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-18</figref>. The plunger <b>290</b> <i>a </i>is sized and adapted to slidably fit within the large diameter portion <b>265</b> and the piston <b>300</b> <i>a </i>is sized adapted to effect a seal with the inner surface of the barrel <b>264</b> <i>a </i>in the large diameter portion <b>265</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0119">The inflation/deflation syringe <b>260</b> <i>a </i>is adapted to operate in the same manner as the syringe <b>260</b> described above and shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-18</figref>. Namely, a plunger actuator head <b>344</b> <i>a </i>supports a collapsible chamber <b>320</b> <i>a </i>to engage threads <b>322</b> <i>a </i>on a chamber outer surface with threads <b>328</b> <i>a </i>on a plunger guide <b>324</b> <i>a </i>inner surface. The plunger <b>290</b> <i>a </i>is thus advanced distally within the barrel <b>264</b> <i>a </i>by rotating a plunger handle <b>330</b>. Indicia <b>267</b> marked on the outside surface of the small diameter section <b>266</b> allow the clinician to precisely gauge the volume of liquid delivered by the syringe <b>260</b> <i>a </i>and the rotational advancement facilitates slow, regulated fluid delivery despite the relatively large size of the barrel <b>264</b> <i>a </i>in the large diameter portion <b>265</b>. When the plunger actuator <b>340</b> <i>a </i>is depressed, moving the head <b>344</b> <i>a </i>out of supporting contact with the chamber legs <b>314</b> <i>a</i>, <b>316</b> <i>a</i>, the chamber <b>320</b> <i>a </i>collapses. The threads <b>322</b> <i>a</i>, <b>328</b> <i>a </i>thus disengage and the piston <b>300</b> <i>a </i>is free to slide linearly within the barrel <b>264</b> <i>a</i>. Thus, the plunger <b>290</b> <i>a </i>may be pulled proximally, rapidly deflating an associated balloon. Because of the relatively large size of the large diameter barrel section <b>265</b>, the syringe <b>260</b> <i>a </i>provides powerful evacuation force.</p>
  <p num="p-0120">With next reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21-27</figref>, another preferred embodiment of a precision syringe <b>360</b> having features in accordance with the present invention is disclosed. With first reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the syringe <b>360</b> includes a body <b>364</b> comprising an elongated hollow barrel <b>366</b>, a lock body <b>368</b>, and a correspondingly hollow plunger guide <b>370</b>. A lumen <b>372</b> is defined extending through the hollow body <b>364</b> and is preferably circular and generally aligned with a longitudinal axis extending through the center of the body <b>364</b>. The barrel <b>366</b> preferably has a capacity ranging between about 0.1 cc and about 10 cc, and more preferably a capacity between about 0.2 cc and about 2 cc, and has a distal end <b>378</b> with an attachment portion <b>380</b> which can be connected to various medical components such as a catheter. Referring particularly to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref>, the attachment portion <b>380</b>, for example, may include a nose <b>382</b>, an injection cap <b>384</b> and internal threads <b>386</b>, but it will be understood that the attachment portion can include any other type of known connector to attach the syringe <b>360</b> to various types of medical components or instruments.</p>
  <p num="p-0121">Referring again primarily to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21-23</figref>, a proximal end <b>390</b> of the barrel <b>366</b> is attached to a distal side <b>392</b> of the lock body <b>368</b>. A proximal side <b>394</b> of the lock body <b>368</b> is coupled to a distal end <b>396</b> of the plunger guide <b>370</b>, which has a proximal end <b>398</b> with a flange or stop <b>400</b> formed thereon. The stop <b>400</b> includes a radially outwardly extending annular ridge. The ridge preferably extends outwardly about 1/16 of an inch from the body <b>364</b> and the ridge preferably has a length of about ⅛ of an inch, but the ridge can have any desired dimensions and configuration.</p>
  <p num="p-0122">The syringe <b>360</b> also includes a plunger <b>404</b> which is sized and dimensioned to be at least partially positioned within the hollow body <b>364</b>. The plunger <b>404</b> includes an elongated shaft <b>406</b> which is generally circular in cross-section and is preferably constructed from material such as plastic, metal or composites. The plunger <b>404</b> is adapted to fit through the plunger guide <b>370</b> and into the barrel <b>366</b> and includes a distal end <b>408</b> which is positioned near the distal end <b>378</b> of the barrel, and a proximal end <b>410</b> which is positioned near the proximal end <b>398</b> of the plunger guide <b>370</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 23</figref>. The distal end <b>408</b> of the plunger <b>404</b> includes a piston <b>414</b> which is adapted to form a seal between the piston <b>414</b> and the inner surface of the barrel <b>366</b>, as above. The plunger shaft <b>406</b> is threaded <b>416</b> from a point near the distal end <b>408</b> to a plunger stop <b>418</b>. The stop <b>418</b> comprises an annular ridge extending outwardly about 1/16 inch from the shaft. A guide ring <b>420</b> within the plunger guide <b>370</b> helps stabilize the plunger <b>404</b> within the guide. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the stop <b>418</b> on the plunger <b>404</b> contacts the plunger guide flange <b>400</b> to prevent further distal advancement of the plunger <b>404</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0123">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the proximal end <b>410</b> of the plunger <b>404</b> includes a handle <b>422</b> comprising a generally circular knob <b>424</b> with ridges <b>426</b> formed around the perimeter thereof to facilitate rotational grip by the clinician. The knob <b>424</b> preferably has a diameter of about 1 inch and a thickness of about ⅛ of an inch so that the clinician can easily grasp it, but the knob can be larger or smaller and it can have any desired shape such as square, rectangular, triangular, etc.</p>
  <p num="p-0124">With further reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</figref>, the lock body <b>368</b> has a slot <b>430</b> which is adapted to receive a locker tab <b>432</b> therein. A hole <b>434</b> extends through the locker tab <b>432</b> and has an upper portion <b>436</b> and a lower portion <b>438</b>. The radius of curvature of the upper portion <b>436</b> is larger than that of the lower portion <b>438</b>, which is threaded <b>439</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>) to match the threads <b>416</b> on the plunger <b>404</b>. A spring <b>440</b> such as a parabolic spring or coiled spring is disposed in the lock body slot <b>430</b> in contact with a curved leading edge <b>442</b> of the tab <b>432</b> and biases the locker tab <b>432</b> away from the spring <b>440</b>. When the plunger <b>404</b> is inserted into the syringe body <b>364</b>, the spring <b>440</b> biases the locker hole threads <b>439</b> into contact with the plunger threads <b>416</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-24</figref>. Thus, to advance or retract the plunger <b>404</b>, the knob <b>424</b> must be rotated so that the plunger <b>404</b> is threaded into or out of the body <b>364</b>. In this manner, precise volumes of liquid may be delivered out of the plunger barrel <b>366</b> in a regulated, relatively slow manner. Thus, build-up of excessive pressure in the occlusion system will be avoided because the plunger <b>404</b> will not be advanced too quickly down the barrel <b>366</b> when ejecting the barrel's contents.</p>
  <p num="p-0125">When a back edge <b>444</b> of the locker tab <b>432</b> is depressed, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25-27</figref>, the locker threads <b>439</b> are taken out of engagement with the plunger threads <b>416</b>. The plunger <b>404</b> is thus free to be slidably moved without resistance from threads. Thus, the plunger knob <b>424</b> can be pushed or pulled to rapidly slide the plunger <b>404</b> within the barrel <b>366</b>. This arrangement is especially desirable to enable quick deflation of an occlusion balloon.</p>
  <p num="p-0126">The above preferred embodiment enables precise regulated injection of liquid when the plunger <b>404</b> is rotated, thus delivering the contents of the barrel <b>366</b> slowly and avoiding over pressurizing a connected occlusion system. However, when the lock tab <b>432</b> is depressed, the syringe <b>360</b> allows rapid deflation of the associated balloon.</p>
  <p num="p-0127"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28-32</figref> show another preferred embodiment of a syringe <b>460</b> having features in accordance with the present invention. The syringe <b>460</b> is adapted to inflate an occlusion balloon by delivering precise volume of liquid in a regulated, low pressure manner that will not cause leaks in a system and also to deflate the occlusion balloon quickly.</p>
  <p num="p-0128">With reference first to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the syringe <b>460</b> comprises a hollow body <b>464</b> with a barrel <b>466</b> extending from a distal end <b>468</b> of the body <b>464</b>. The majority of the body <b>464</b> has a greater diameter than the barrel <b>466</b>, which preferably has a capacity between about 0.1 cc and 10 cc, and more preferably between about 0.2 cc and 2 cc. The barrel <b>466</b> has a distal end <b>469</b> with an attachment portion <b>470</b> which can be connected to various medical components such as a catheter. The attachment portion <b>470</b> may include, for example, a nose <b>472</b>, an injection cap, and internal threads, but it will be understood that the attachment portion can include any type of known connector to attach the syringe <b>460</b> to various types of medical components or instruments.</p>
  <p num="p-0129">A plunger <b>480</b> is disposed within the body <b>464</b> and barrel <b>466</b> and comprises a shaft <b>482</b> with a piston <b>484</b> attached to a distal end thereof. The piston <b>484</b> is adapted to form a seal between the piston <b>484</b> and the inner surface of the barrel <b>466</b>, as above. A shuttle <b>490</b> is attached to a proximal end <b>492</b> of the plunger shaft <b>482</b> and is slidably disposed within the main body <b>464</b>. With further reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, the shuttle <b>490</b> has a chamber <b>494</b> formed therewithin and an opening <b>496</b> to the chamber <b>494</b> is formed at a proximal end <b>498</b> of the shuttle <b>490</b>. The chamber <b>494</b> is preferably substantially cylindrical and has a proximal neck portion <b>500</b> surrounding the opening <b>496</b> and having a diameter less than the diameter of the majority of the chamber <b>494</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0130">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28-31</figref>, a plunger actuator <b>502</b> is provided which comprises a shaft <b>504</b> having a distal end <b>506</b> which is disposed in the shuttle chamber <b>494</b> and a proximal end <b>508</b> which extends out of a proximal end <b>510</b> of the body <b>464</b> and on which a handle <b>512</b> is formed. The handle <b>512</b> preferably comprises a generally circular disk <b>514</b> with a diameter of about ⅞ of an inch and a thickness of about ⅛ of an inch so that the clinician can easily grasp it. However, the disk can be larger or smaller and it can have any desired shape.</p>
  <p num="p-0131">An annular stop ridge <b>518</b> is formed on the distal end <b>506</b> of the plunger actuator <b>502</b>. The ridge <b>518</b> is sized and adapted to slide freely within the chamber <b>494</b>, but has a diameter greater than that of the chamber neck <b>500</b> and will not fit through the opening <b>496</b>. Therefore, the stop ridge <b>518</b> prevents the plunger actuator <b>502</b> from being completely removed from the shuttle chamber <b>494</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0132">The proximal end <b>498</b> of the shuttle <b>490</b> has a flat surface on which a distal end <b>520</b> of a coil spring <b>522</b> rests. The spring <b>522</b> encircles the plunger actuator shaft <b>504</b> and extends proximally to a spring stop ridge <b>524</b> which protrudes annularly from the shaft <b>504</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0133">Referring more particularly to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 and 30</figref>, the proximal end <b>510</b> of the body <b>464</b> has a flange <b>526</b> formed thereon. A hollow detent cylinder <b>530</b> extends longitudinally from the body flange <b>526</b>. A cover <b>532</b> is disposed on a proximal end of the detent cylinder <b>530</b> and has an opening <b>536</b> formed therethrough. A detent mechanism <b>540</b> is disposed within the detent cylinder <b>530</b>. With further reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, the detent mechanism <b>540</b> preferably comprises opposing tabs <b>542</b>, <b>543</b> linearly movable in a direction generally perpendicular to the body <b>464</b> and biased toward each other by springs <b>544</b>, <b>545</b>. A cavity <b>546</b>, <b>547</b> is formed in each tab <b>542</b>, <b>543</b>, respectively, and is adapted to closely surround the plunger actuator shaft <b>504</b>. With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 and 30</figref>, a detent ridge <b>548</b> protrudes annularly from the plunger actuator shaft <b>504</b> between the spring stop <b>524</b> and the handle <b>512</b>. A distal surface <b>550</b> of the detent ridge <b>548</b> is preferably sloped at about a 45° angle relative to the detent tabs <b>542</b>, <b>543</b>. The sloped distal surface <b>550</b> is adapted to deflect the detent tabs <b>542</b>, <b>543</b> when the detent ridge <b>548</b> passes between them, thereby facilitating easy passage of the detent ridge <b>548</b> through the detent mechanism <b>540</b>. A proximal surface <b>552</b> of the detent ridge <b>548</b> is also sloped, preferably at an angle relative to the detent tabs <b>542</b>, <b>543</b> of about 15-40° and most preferably about 30°. The sloped proximal surface <b>552</b> is also adapted to deflect the tabs <b>542</b>, <b>543</b> to facilitate passage of the detent ridge <b>548</b> through the detent mechanism <b>540</b>, but due to the slope angle, significantly more force is required to move the detent ridge <b>548</b> proximally through the tabs than distally through the tabs.</p>
  <p num="p-0134">This arrangement is particularly useful when operating the syringe <b>460</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, when the disk <b>514</b> is pushed downward so that the detent ridge <b>548</b> passes through the detent mechanism <b>540</b>, the spring <b>522</b> is compressed against the shuttle <b>490</b> and the distal end <b>506</b> of the plunger actuator <b>502</b> approaches a distal end <b>554</b> of the shuttle chamber <b>494</b>. When compressed, the spring <b>522</b> exerts a reaction force F on the spring lock <b>524</b> and the shuttle <b>490</b>. The spring <b>522</b> is adapted to not generate enough spring force F to push the detent ridge <b>548</b> proximally through the detent mechanism <b>540</b>. Therefore, the spring force F instead tends to move the shuttle <b>490</b> in a distal direction, thus advancing the plunger <b>480</b> toward the barrel's distal end <b>469</b> until the contents of the barrel <b>466</b> are delivered and the spring <b>522</b> is relaxed, as shown in FIG. <b>31</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0135">An advantage of the present embodiment is regulation of pressure build-up in the occlusion system. As discussed above, when liquid is injected too quickly into the system, pressure may build to very high levels and cause leaks in the system. The present embodiment allows a clinician to not worry about the rate of entry of liquid into the system. Instead, the clinician simply depresses the tab <b>514</b> until the detent ridge <b>548</b> is engaged with the detent mechanism <b>540</b>. The spring <b>522</b> is thus compressed as shown in FIG. <b>30</b>. As discussed above, the spring exerts force F to move the shuttle <b>490</b> and plunger <b>480</b> distally within the body <b>464</b>, delivering the contents of the barrels <b>466</b> to the occlusion system. However, the spring <b>522</b> is chosen to have a spring constant adapted to exert a force less than the pressure that would cause a leak in the system. Thus, the spring <b>522</b> will inherently regulate system pressure during fluid delivery.</p>
  <p num="p-0136">To deflate the occlusion balloon, the clinician pulls the plunger actuator <b>502</b> proximally, preferably moving the plunger <b>480</b> from the position depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> to the position shown in FIG. <b>25</b>. The pulling force of the clinician is sufficient to move the detent ridge <b>548</b> through the detent mechanism <b>540</b> and the plunger actuator stop ridge <b>518</b> contacts the shuttle neck <b>500</b> so that the shuttle <b>490</b>, and thus the plunger <b>480</b>, moves proximally with the plunger actuator <b>502</b>. Thus, the contents of the catheter are drawn into the barrel <b>466</b> and the balloon is deflated quickly</p>
  <heading>III. Inflation Syringe and Balloon Sizing System</heading> <p num="p-0137">To accommodate a variety of vessel sizes, various sizes of occlusion balloons are typically used. For example, balloon diameters of 3.0 mm, 3.5 mm, 4.0 mm, 4.5 mm, 5.0 mm, 5.5 mm, and 6.0 mm are common. Balloons with diameters of 2.0 mm, 2.5 mm and 7.0 mm are also useful. Prior systems required different inflation devices to be used in combination with each of the balloon sizes. Further details are provided in the above-referenced application SYRINGE AND METHOD FOR INFLATING LOW VOLUME CATHETER BALLOONS. Improvements in balloon technology have resulted in at least one system in which a single balloon is suitable for use in a number of different vessel diameters. These improvements are disclosed in the above-referenced U.S. Application BALLOON CATHETER AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURE.</p>
  <p num="p-0138">A single syringe may be used to provide inflation fluid to the balloon. If desired, the syringe may be marked with indicia along its barrel to assist the physician during inflation of the balloon. The indicia are adapted to enable precise delivery of low volumes of fluid, but also versatile enough to enable accurate delivery of a range of volumes. For example, a 2.0 mm diameter balloon may be able to accommodate only about 0.01 cc of inflation fluid and a 7.0 mm balloon may require about 0.25 cc of fluid</p>
  <heading>IV. Syringe Assembly</heading> <p num="p-0139">In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an inflation syringe <b>60</b> is depicted used in an assembly <b>50</b> including a conventional high capacity or reservoir syringe <b>62</b>. The reservoir syringe <b>62</b> provides the desirable power and volume for quickly priming the balloon <b>72</b> and guidewire <b>70</b>, as well as for quickly deflating the balloon <b>72</b> for withdrawal from the patient. However, it will be noted that the inflation syringe <b>60</b> can be utilized in combination with other reservoir systems, of which the assembly <b>50</b> is only one example. Also, any of the preferred syringe embodiments disclosed above can be utilized in combination with such a reservoir syringe <b>62</b> or other reservoir systems.</p>
  <p num="p-0140">An alternative syringe assembly is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, wherein a conventional four-way manifold <b>600</b> is attached to a reservoir syringe <b>602</b> and a y-connection <b>604</b> is attached to the proximal end of a catheter <b>610</b>. The manifold <b>600</b> provides a pressure monitoring line <b>612</b>, a dye supply line <b>614</b>, a saline supply line <b>616</b>, and a waste removal line <b>618</b>. Proximal this first connection <b>604</b>, another y-connection <b>620</b> couples a low volume syringe <b>630</b> with a guidewire <b>632</b> and, thus, with the manifold <b>600</b> and reservoir syringe <b>602</b>. The syringe <b>630</b> is used to inflate the distal balloon <b>636</b> on guidewire <b>632</b>. Although the use of a manifold <b>600</b> is typically reserved for procedures using larger or therapeutic balloons, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention is readily adapted for use with this more elaborate system.</p>
  <p num="p-0141">As understood by those skilled in the art, the assembly in the present invention is not limited to the embodiments discussed herein, and may be included with other adapters, manifolds, and/or connectors, as desired. That is, advantages realized from the use of the low volume syringe with the higher volume syringe for deflation and inflation of a balloon during various procedures is not limited to their particular connections or additional apparatus.</p>
  <p num="p-0142">Another preferred embodiment of a syringe assembly <b>650</b> for inflation and deflation of an occlusion balloon is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34-44</figref>. With first reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, the syringe assembly <b>650</b> comprises a low-volume inflation syringe <b>660</b> and a high capacity or reservoir syringe <b>662</b> encased together in a housing <b>664</b>. Like the syringe assembly <b>50</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, the syringe assembly <b>650</b> is preferably attached via a connector <b>666</b> and a short tube <b>668</b> to an adapter <b>54</b> within which a low profile catheter valve <b>66</b> and a balloon catheter <b>70</b> are engaged during use.</p>
  <p num="p-0143"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> illustrates the present syringe assembly <b>650</b> without its housing <b>664</b>. As shown, the inflation and reservoir syringes <b>660</b>, <b>662</b> are preferably oriented side-by-side and in communication with each other through a channel <b>680</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0144">With continued reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, the inflation syringe <b>660</b> preferably has a capacity ranging between about 0.02 cc and 2 cc. The syringe <b>660</b> includes a hollow barrel <b>682</b> having an open proximal end <b>684</b> and a distal end <b>686</b> with an attachment portion <b>688</b> which can be connected to various medical components, such as a catheter, in any known manner. A port <b>690</b> is formed through the side of the barrel <b>682</b> between the proximal <b>684</b> and distal <b>686</b> ends.</p>
  <p num="p-0145">The syringe <b>660</b> also includes a plunger <b>692</b> longitudinally slidable within the barrel <b>682</b> and sized and dimensioned to be at least partially positioned within the barrel <b>682</b>. The plunger <b>692</b> includes an elongate shaft <b>694</b> with a distal end <b>696</b> and a proximal end <b>698</b>. A piston <b>699</b> is disposed on the distal end <b>696</b> and is adapted to form a seal between the piston <b>699</b> and the inner surface of the barrel <b>682</b>. The proximal end <b>698</b> of the plunger shaft <b>694</b> is preferably attached to a gear rack <b>700</b> having a plurality of gear teeth or ridges <b>702</b> formed thereon. Preferably, the gear pitch is about 48 and the gear rack <b>700</b> is about ⅛″ thick. The gear rack <b>700</b> is preferably formed of modified molded nylon and alternatively could be formed of stainless steel.</p>
  <p num="p-0146">The reservoir syringe <b>662</b> provides desirable power and volume for quickly priming the balloon and catheter. It is preferably of any conventional large volume syringe type with a capacity of between about 10-50 cc and more preferably about 40 cc. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, the reservoir syringe <b>662</b> preferably has a generally cylindrical hollow barrel <b>710</b> having an open proximal end <b>712</b> and a tapered distal end <b>714</b>. The tapered distal end <b>714</b> of the barrel <b>710</b> opens into the channel <b>680</b>, which leads to the inflation syringe port <b>690</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0147">The reservoir syringe <b>662</b> also includes a plunger <b>716</b> which is sized and dimensioned to be at least partially positioned within the hollow barrel <b>710</b>. The plunger <b>716</b> includes an elongated shaft <b>718</b> which is generally circular in cross-section and is preferably constructed from material such as plastic or composites. A distal end <b>720</b> of the plunger shaft <b>718</b> includes a piston <b>722</b> which is adapted to form a seal between the piston <b>722</b> and the inner surface of the barrel <b>710</b>. A handle <b>730</b> is formed at a proximal end <b>732</b> of the plunger <b>716</b>. Preferably, the handle <b>730</b> is large, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34-43</figref>, and is easily held in a clinician's hand.</p>
  <p num="p-0148">With next reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37-42</figref>, the housing <b>664</b> preferably comprises a right half <b>740</b> and a left half <b>742</b> attached by screws, bolts, a sonic weld, or other means. The housing <b>664</b> is adapted to fit around the syringe assembly <b>650</b>. With particular reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41 and 42</figref>, each housing half <b>740</b>, <b>742</b> has a large cavity <b>744</b> and a small cavity <b>746</b> to accommodate the large and small syringe barrels <b>710</b>, <b>682</b>, respectively. Each housing half <b>740</b>, <b>742</b> further includes a channel cavity <b>748</b> and gear rack cavity <b>750</b> to accommodate the channel <b>680</b> and gear rack <b>700</b>, respectively. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref> depicts the syringe assembly <b>650</b> disposed in a housing half <b>740</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0149">With reference again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37-42</figref>, a large window <b>752</b> is formed through each housing half to allow the clinician to view the contents of the large syringe barrel <b>710</b>. Similarly, a cutout <b>754</b> is formed in each housing half to allow the clinician to view the contents of the inflation syringe barrel <b>682</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0150">An inflation/deflation knob <b>760</b> is disposed on the outside of the housing <b>664</b>. The inflation knob <b>760</b> is preferably formed of Delrin plastic but may also be preferably formed of metal or other plastics such as polycarbonate or ABS. With particular reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43 and 44</figref>, the knob <b>760</b> is connected to a spur gear <b>762</b> having a pitch of about 48 and a pitch diameter of preferably about 0.292 inches. The spur gear <b>762</b> is adapted to engagingly mate the gear rack <b>700</b> attached to the inflation syringe <b>660</b>. The teeth <b>764</b> of the spur gear <b>762</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>, communicate with the gear rack <b>700</b>. Thus, when the knob <b>760</b> is rotated, the rotating spur gear <b>762</b> linearly moves the rack <b>700</b>, thus advancing or retracting the plunger <b>692</b> within the inflation syringe barrel <b>682</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0151">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, indicia <b>770</b> are preferably located on the housing <b>664</b> adjacent the knob <b>760</b> so that a clinician using the device can monitor the precise volume of liquid delivered by the inflation syringe <b>660</b>. As depicted, the indicia <b>770</b> preferably comprise numbers corresponding to the size and shape of balloon used. When the knob <b>760</b> is rotated from the “DEFLATE” or “0” position to the number corresponding to the balloon in use, the syringe assembly <b>650</b> delivers the fluid volume associated with that balloon size. Alternatively, the indicia <b>770</b> could indicate the standard or metric volume of fluid delivered at each position.</p>
  <p num="p-0152">To use the device, the inflation syringe plunger piston <b>699</b> is preferably first disposed immediately adjacent the proximal side of the port <b>690</b>, as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 43</figref>. The knob <b>760</b> is positioned to correspond with the legend “DEFLATE” or “0” as indicated on the housing. The clinician connects the syringe assembly connector <b>666</b> to a source of balloon inflation fluid, preferably a diluted heparinized saline/contrast mixture, and retracts the large plunger <b>716</b> to fill the assembly <b>650</b> with 10-15 cc of fluid. Air is next purged from the syringe assembly <b>650</b> by holding the device vertically with the tip <b>686</b> pointing up and flushing air and air bubbles out by depressing the reservoir plunger <b>716</b>. Excess fluid is flushed out, leaving about 5-10 cc of fluid.</p>
  <p num="p-0153">The syringe assembly <b>650</b> is next connected to the occlusion catheter <b>70</b>, preferably through an adapter <b>54</b> such as discussed above. The reservoir plunger <b>716</b> is then further retracted to prime the catheter. When priming, the reservoir plunger <b>716</b> is preferably held fully retracted for about 30 seconds until substantial all air within the catheter <b>70</b> has been aspirated. When the air is aspirated, the plunger <b>716</b> is slowly released to a neutral position.</p>
  <p num="p-0154">When priming is complete and the surgical balloon is positioned as desired in the patient, the clinician rotates the knob <b>760</b> from the “DEFLATE” position to the desired setting corresponding to the balloon size and shape being used. Rotating the knob <b>760</b> moves the inflation syringe plunger <b>692</b> linearly towards the distal end <b>686</b> of the inflation syringe barrel <b>682</b>, thus delivering inflation fluid to the balloon <b>72</b>. To deflate the balloon, the knob <b>760</b> is rotated back to the “DEFLATE” position, thus linearly retracting the plunger <b>692</b> and drawing the inflation liquid back into the inflation syringe barrel <b>682</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0155">With next reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>, an exploded perspective view of another embodiment of a syringe assembly <b>800</b> is disclosed. Syringe assembly <b>800</b> is similar in construction and operation to the syringe assembly <b>650</b> just discussed. Since syringe assembly <b>800</b> shares many similarities with the above syringe assembly <b>650</b>, similar parts share part numbers; however, parts associated with syringe assembly <b>800</b> include the appellation “a.”</p>
  <p num="p-0156">Referring next to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>, a knob assembly <b>802</b> is disclosed for use with the syringe assembly <b>800</b>. The knob assembly <b>802</b> includes a knob plate <b>804</b> with an access hole <b>806</b> formed therethrough and a detent ring <b>808</b> encircling the hole <b>806</b>. Indicia <b>770</b> <i>a </i>are printed on the knob plate <b>804</b> adjacent the detent ring <b>808</b>. At least two rods <b>810</b> depend from the knob <b>760</b> <i>a </i>and are adapted to extend through the hole <b>806</b>. Referring back to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>, the right and left halves <b>740</b> <i>a</i>, <b>742</b> <i>a </i>of the syringe assembly housing <b>664</b> <i>a </i>each have a shallow cavity <b>812</b> formed in an upper portion. The cavity <b>812</b> is adapted to receive the knob plate <b>804</b> complementarily therewithin, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 47 and 48</figref>. Referring back to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45 and 46</figref>, the rods <b>810</b> extend through the knob plate hole <b>806</b> to interact with a gear rack <b>700</b> <i>a </i>which is attached to an inflation plunger <b>692</b> <i>a</i>. As shown more particularly in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45 and 49</figref>, the gear rack <b>700</b> <i>a </i>preferably comprises a series of channels <b>814</b> sized and adapted to accept the rods <b>810</b> therein. The channels <b>814</b> and rods <b>810</b> are further adapted so that when the knob <b>760</b> <i>a </i>is rotated, correspondingly moving the rods <b>810</b>, the rods <b>810</b> move within the channels <b>814</b> and engage the channel walls <b>816</b> to advance or retract the attached inflation syringe plunger <b>692</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0157">Referring back to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>, the knob <b>760</b> <i>a </i>has a detent hole (not shown) into which a spring <b>820</b> is placed. A ball <b>822</b> is placed in the hole with the spring <b>820</b>. When the knob <b>760</b> <i>a </i>is installed into the knob plate <b>804</b>, the ball <b>822</b> is urged into contact with the detent ring <b>808</b>. Cavities <b>824</b> are formed in the detent ring <b>808</b>, each cavity <b>824</b> adjacent to a corresponding indicia mark <b>770</b> <i>a </i>which, in turn, corresponds to a particular balloon size. Thus, as the knob <b>760</b> <i>a </i>is rotated to any delineated indicia location, the spring <b>820</b> forces the ball <b>822</b> into the accompanying cavity <b>824</b>, effectuating a detent.</p>
  <p num="p-0158">Referring back to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>, the syringe assembly <b>800</b> includes an inflation barrel <b>682</b> <i>a </i>having a relatively low volume, preferably between about 0.02 cc-1.0 cc. The inflation barrel <b>682</b> <i>a </i>preferably comprises a distal portion <b>828</b>, medial portion <b>830</b>, and proximal portion <b>832</b> mated together. Referring also to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 47 and 50</figref>, the medial portion <b>830</b> includes a port <b>690</b> <i>a </i>which connects to the channel <b>680</b> <i>a </i>between the reservoir syringe barrel <b>710</b> <i>a </i>and the inflation barrel <b>682</b> <i>a</i>. The distal portion <b>828</b> and proximal portion <b>832</b> each have a mating member <b>834</b> which fits complementarily into cavities formed in the medial portion <b>830</b>, thus defining a continuous lumen <b>838</b> through the barrel <b>682</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0159">Referring next to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>, the inflation plunger <b>692</b> <i>a </i>extending from the gear rack <b>700</b> <i>a </i>preferably comprises a substantially cylindrical precision-milled stainless steel rod. With reference also to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>, the barrel <b>682</b> <i>a </i>has a capacity ranging from between about 0.02 cc to 1.0 cc and most preferably between about 0.25 cc to 0.50 cc. The plunger <b>692</b> <i>a </i>is adapted to slide freely within the barrel <b>682</b> <i>a</i>. The medial portion <b>830</b> of the inflation barrel <b>682</b> <i>a </i>preferably includes a pair of O-ring seals <b>840</b>, one disposed on either side of the port <b>690</b> <i>a</i>. The O-rings <b>840</b> are preferably sized to effect a seal with the inflation plunger <b>692</b> <i>a</i>. In operation, when the inflation plunger <b>692</b> <i>a </i>is advanced within the barrel <b>682</b> <i>a </i>through the O-ring seals <b>840</b>, the plunger displaces fluid within the barrel lumen <b>838</b>. The displaced fluid is forced out of the barrel <b>682</b> <i>a </i>through the distal end <b>686</b> <i>a</i>, and is thus delivered to an attached balloon catheter. Since delivery of fluid is determined by the volume displaced by the plunger <b>692</b> <i>a</i>, very small volumes may be precisely delivered without requiring the syringe barrel <b>682</b> <i>a </i>to have a very small inner diameter that would require expensive manufacturing.</p>
  <p num="p-0160">Thus, certain advantages of the embodiment of the present invention shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 47 and 50</figref> are evident. In one aspect of this embodiment, the piston <b>834</b>, as it is moved distally (or to the left in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 47 and 50</figref>) serves to seal the port <b>690</b> <i>a</i>, thereby shutting off any access to the volumetric capacity of the reservoir syringe barrel <b>710</b> <i>a</i>. In effect, then, this configuration eliminates the need or use of a stopcock which would typically be utilized in a two-separate-syringe embodiment. Accordingly, in this embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an automatic valve for communication with either the inflation barrel <b>682</b> <i>a </i>or the reservoir syringe barrel <b>710</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0161">In another aspect of this embodiment, the inflation barrel <b>682</b> <i>a </i>is situated so as to be distally oriented with respect to the reservoir syringe barrel <b>710</b> <i>a</i>. This arrangement facilitates the automatic valve or sealing mechanism described in the previous paragraph, while still providing a long range of travel for the plunger <b>692</b> <i>a </i>of the reservoir syringe barrel <b>710</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0162">Moreover, as best illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>, this longer range of travel, coupled with a minimized diameter of the plunger <b>692</b> <i>a </i>of the inflation barrel <b>682</b> <i>a</i>, provides for a very accurate syringe, in the sense that it is able to deliver very accurate and small volumes of fluid such as 0.05 cc, etc. This is achieved, in part, by fixing the O-ring seal <b>840</b>, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>, and allowing only the plunger <b>692</b> <i>a </i>to pass through the O-ring <b>840</b>. This means that the pressure of the inflation barrel <b>682</b> <i>a </i>is determined by the diameter of the plunger and not by the entire outer diameter of the barrel <b>682</b> <i>a</i>. In other words, if the O-ring were to move with the plunger <b>692</b> <i>a</i>, the pressure, and therefore the volume of fluid delivered, would vary with the entire inner diameter of the inflation barrel <b>682</b> <i>a</i>. With a smaller diameter plunger and a fixed O-ring, the smaller cross-sectional surface area defined by the diameter of the plunger allows the plunger to travel a greater distance while still delivering a smaller, accurate volume of fluid. Accordingly, it is easier to manufacture and to hold tolerances relative to a plunger rather than the inner diameter of a barrel or syringe.</p>
  <p num="p-0163">With reference next to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>, the reservoir syringe plunger <b>716</b> <i>a </i>preferably has a main body <b>842</b> with two substantially flat opposing surfaces <b>844</b> and two arcuate opposing surfaces <b>846</b>. A cylindrical distal portion <b>848</b> extends from a distal end of the main body <b>842</b>. The distal cylinder <b>848</b> has a diameter substantially equal to the distance between the opposing flat surface <b>844</b>; the diametrical distance between the arcuate surfaces <b>846</b> is greater than the distal cylinder <b>848</b> diameter. Thus, a distal notch <b>850</b> is defined between each arcuate surface <b>846</b> and the distal cylinder <b>848</b> surface.</p>
  <p num="p-0164">Referring next to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45 and 46</figref>, the housing <b>664</b> <i>a </i>is adapted to complementarily receive the plunger main body <b>842</b>. Specifically, the housing <b>664</b> <i>a </i>has flat sides <b>852</b> which are complementary to the flat surfaces <b>844</b> of the main body, and arcuate sides <b>854</b> which complement the arcuate surfaces <b>846</b> of the plunger. This construction allows the plunger <b>746</b> <i>a </i>to slide within the housing <b>664</b> <i>a</i>, but not to rotate. A lock notch <b>856</b> is formed at the proximal end of the housing <b>664</b> <i>a</i>. When the plunger <b>716</b> <i>a </i>is retracted from the reservoir barrel <b>710</b> <i>a </i>so that the plunger distal notch <b>850</b> is proximal the housing lock notch <b>856</b>, the plunger main body <b>842</b> is free of the housing and the plunger may be rotated. When the plunger <b>716</b> <i>a </i>is rotated about one-quarter turn, the plunger notch <b>850</b> will engage the housing lock notch <b>856</b>, preventing the plunger <b>716</b> <i>a </i>from advancing within the reservoir barrel <b>710</b> <i>a</i>. Such a plunger lock is most useful during priming of the system and when deflating the balloon.</p>
  <p num="p-0165">The syringe assembly <b>800</b> is preferably operated in conjunction with an inflation adapter <b>54</b> and balloon catheter <b>70</b> in a manner similar to the syringe assembly <b>650</b> discussed above. Once the balloon is inflated, the adapter is preferably actuated to close the catheter valve <b>66</b>, thus maintaining balloon inflation. To deflate the balloon, the knob <b>760</b> <i>a </i>is preferably rotated back to the “0” position, retracting the plunger <b>716</b> <i>a </i>within the inflation barrel <b>682</b> <i>a</i>, prior to opening the catheter valve <b>66</b>.

  <heading>V. Alternative Uses for the Dual Syringe System</heading> <p num="p-0166">In addition to providing a highly responsive inflation system for an occlusion balloon, the dual syringe system also has a variety of other uses. For instance, the system could be used to deliver precise amounts of therapeutic drugs or medicine to the patient. The system may also be used for irrigation or aspiration. Additionally, the system can be used to infuse whole blood as is described below.</p>
  <p num="p-0167">Typically, whole blood is infused into patients with roller type pumps. One problem associated with this type of pump is that roller mechanisms apply a shear stress that often damages the blood cells with the crushing force of the rollers. The dual syringe system could overcome the problem of damaging the blood by providing a hydrostatic pressure that would provide pressure for the transfusion without causing the damaging forces on the cells. The blood cells, because of their circular shape, can withstand great hydrostatic pressure and therefore would not be damaged. Preferably, the large volume syringe will be used to infuse blood.</p>
  <p num="p-0168">A low volume syringe or syringe assembly having features in accordance with the present invention is not limited to use only with the inflation adapter as presented herein. Other arrangements or assemblies may include syringe embodiments of the present invention. Similarly, the method of the present invention may omit the use of an inflation adapter without loss of benefit from the present invention.</p>
  <heading>VI. Method for Prevention of Distal Embolization</heading> <p num="p-0169">Described below is an improved method for preventing distal embolization during removal of plaque, thrombi or other occlusions from a blood vessel. A preferred embodiment of the present invention is adapted for use in the treatment of a stenosis or an occlusion in a blood vessel in which the stenosis or occlusion has a length and a width or thickness which at least partially occludes the vessel's lumen. Thus, the method is effective in treating both partial and complete occlusions of the blood vessels. It is to be understood that “occlusion” as used herein includes both complete and partial occlusions, stenoses, emboli, thrombi, plaque and any other substance which at least partially occludes the lumen of the blood vessel.</p>
  <p num="p-0170">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, aspiration is performed while advancing a guidewire across the site of the occlusion in a proximal to distal direction to prevent distal embolization. An aspiration catheter is delivered over the guidewire to a site just proximal to the site of the occlusion, and, while aspirating, the occlusion in the vessel is crossed with both the guidewire and the catheter in a proximal to distal direction. In a preferred embodiment, the distal tip of the aspiration catheter is no more than 2 cm, more preferably no more than 0.5-1 cm, behind or proximal to the distal tip of the guidewire during crossing. The distal end of the aspiration catheter is then moved in a distal to proximal direction across the occlusion, while continuously aspirating. This process ensures the removal of any particles which may be created during the delivery of the guidewire to a position distal to at least a portion of the occlusion. Aspiration from proximal to distal, and distal to proximal, can be repeated as many times as necessary to completely aspirate all particles. These steps are all performed prior to occlusion of the vessel at a site distal to the occlusion and treatment of the occlusion. It should be noted that, as used herein, “proximal” refers to the portion of the apparatus closest to the end which remains outside the patient's body, and “distal” refers to the portion closest to the end inserted into the patient's body.</p>
  <p num="p-0171">The aspiration method disclosed herein can be used in any vessel of the body where the pressure is at least 0.2 psi at any time during the diastolic/systolic cycle of the heart, and, preferably, is about 1.2 psi, and is capable of providing a flow rate of at least 5 cc/minute when not occluded. Thus, although the pressure within any vessel may fall below 0.2 psi during relaxation between heartbeats, so long as the pressure created by the heartbeat rises to at least 0.2 psi, the pressure within the vessel will be sufficient.</p>
  <p num="p-0172">The present method is particularly suited for use in removal of occlusions from saphenous vein grafts, coronary and carotid arteries, and vessels having similar pressures and flow.</p>
  <p num="p-0173">In a preferred embodiment of the method of the present invention, a guide catheter is first introduced into the patient's vasculature through an incision made in the femoral artery in the groin and is used to guide the insertion of other catheters and devices to the desired site, as described above. A guidewire is then advanced until its distal end reaches a site proximal to the occlusion. Fluoroscopy is typically used to guide the guidewire and other devices to the desired location within the patient. The devices are frequently marked with radiopaque markings to facilitate visualization of the insertion and positioning of the devices within the patient's vasculature. It should be noted that at this point, blood is flowing through the vessel in a proximal to distal direction.</p>
  <p num="p-0174">In contrast to previous methods, in one embodiment the guidewire does not cross the occlusion prior to aspiration with an aspiration catheter or other suitable catheter which can provide aspiration pressure. Instead, an aspiration catheter is inserted over the guidewire and the two are simultaneously or concomitantly moved past the occlusion, proximal to distal, while aspirating, to prevent material which dislodges or breaks off the occlusion from entering the vasculature and producing distal emboli. The method is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52 and 53</figref> and described in detail below. After crossing of the occlusion by the aspiration catheter and guidewire while aspirating, the aspiration catheter is moved in a distal to proximal direction, also while aspirating. The aspiration catheter is then removed, and therapy performed on the occlusion.</p>
  <p num="p-0175">A guidewire having an occlusive device on its distal end is preferably used in the present method. The method can be effectively carried out, however, using a number of guidewires or catheters that perform the function of occluding the vessel and allowing for the slidable insertion of various other catheters and devices. For example, a guidewire having an expandable device such as an inflatable balloon, filter, expandable braid or other mechanical occlusive device attached at its distal end can be used. The expandable occlusive device should be capable of preventing the migration of particles and debris from the working area, either through total or partial occlusion of the vessel. The occlusion of the vessel need not be complete. Substantial occlusion of the vessel can be sufficient for purposes of the present method.</p>
  <p num="p-0176">As the guidewire and aspiration catheter cross the occlusion, blood enters the vessel and keeps any particles dislodged during the procedure from flowing in a distal to proximal direction. In addition, the blood pressure and flow provides the irrigation necessary for aspiration. As noted above, the blood pressure in the vessel is preferably at least about 0.2 psi, and the vessel is capable of providing a flow rate of at least about 5 cc per minute when not occluded.</p>
  <p num="p-0177">After the distal end of the guidewire having an occlusive device is delivered past the site of the occlusion and aspiration is complete, the occlusive device is activated, occluding the vessel at a site distal to the site of the occlusion. Once the blood vessel is occluded, therapy can be performed to remove or reduce the occlusion. A therapy catheter can be used if desired. The therapy catheter can be any of a number of devices, including a balloon catheter used to perform angioplasty, a catheter which delivers a stent, a catheter for delivering enzymes, chemicals, or drugs to dissolve and treat the occlusion, an atherectomy device, or a laser or ultrasound device used to ablate the occlusion. Alternatively, the therapy catheter can be eliminated and use of the guide catheter or the aspiration catheter alone can be used to aspirate the occlusion. This method is especially useful to remove emboli from the coronary arteries following acute myocardial infarction, because the aspiration catheter can be made small enough to enter the coronary arteries.</p>
  <p num="p-0178">Once the desired therapy is performed, the therapy catheter is withdrawn from the patient's body and the aspiration catheter can once again be delivered over the guidewire. The aspiration catheter can ride over the guidewire with the guidewire inserted through the aspiration lumen of the catheter. Alternatively, a single operator type aspiration catheter can be used, in which only a portion of the aspiration catheter rides over the guidewire, which is inserted into a separate guidewire lumen.</p>
  <p num="p-0179">The method of the invention shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref> can be used especially following myocardial infarction, for totally occluded vessels and partially occluded vessels defined by TIMI 0-1 flow, and having no major side branch. However, the method of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref> is not intended to be limited only to such applications, and may also be used for vessels having blood flow through side branches. TIMI stands for “thrombolysis in myocardial infarction.” This value is measured angiographically by injecting a dye and noting the time it takes to clear through the blood vessel. A TIMI of 3 means that the vessel is open. A TIMI of 0 means that the vessel is totally occluded. In a totally occluded vessel, one cannot visualize past the site of the occlusion because the dye will not flow past the occlusion. Because the site cannot be visualized, a distal occlusive device generally cannot be used.</p>
  <p num="p-0180">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52A-H</figref>, a guidewire <b>900</b> is inserted into the blood vessel <b>902</b> until the distal tip is just proximal to occlusion <b>904</b> (FIG. <b>52</b>A). An aspiration catheter <b>906</b> is delivered over the guidewire <b>900</b> so that the distal end of the guidewire <b>900</b> and the distal end of the aspiration catheter <b>906</b> are just proximal to the occlusion <b>904</b> (FIG. <b>52</b>B). Aspiration is performed while crossing or advancing past the occlusion <b>904</b> with the distal end of the guidewire <b>900</b>, in a proximal to distal direction (FIG. <b>52</b>C). In other words, both the aspiration catheter <b>906</b> and the guidewire <b>900</b> are moved in a proximal to distal direction across the occlusion <b>904</b> while aspirating through the distal end of the aspiration catheter. Aspirating while crossing in this manner thus removes any particles that may be broken off due to crossing of the occlusion. The distal end of the aspiration catheter <b>906</b> is then moved back in a distal to proximal direction while aspirating (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52D</figref>) to further remove particles. Blood flow into the aspiration catheter <b>906</b> is indicated by the arrows. The proximal to distal, then distal to proximal, aspiration may be repeated one or more times if desired to ensure removal of emboli or particles formed during movement of the devices across the occlusion <b>904</b>. After aspiration, TIMI flow may be determined.</p>
  <p num="p-0181">The aspiration catheter <b>906</b> is then removed and the guidewire <b>900</b> is then exchanged for a guidewire <b>907</b> having an occlusive device on its distal end <b>908</b> (e.g., GUARDWIRE, PercuSurge, Sunnyvale, Calif.) (FIG. <b>52</b>E). Further details of an exchange catheter are described in assignee's application entitled EXCHANGE CATHETER AND METHOD OF USE, application Ser. No. 09/026,464, filed Feb. 19, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,159,195, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Alternatively, the aspiration catheter may remain in place for delivery of guidewire <b>907</b> to aspirate any additional particles that may break free of occlusion <b>904</b> while the guidewire <b>907</b> crosses the occlusion, such as described with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref> below. In this embodiment, the aspiration catheter itself may be used as an exchange catheter. The occlusive device <b>908</b>, such as a balloon, at the end of the guidewire <b>907</b> is advanced to a site just distal the site of the occlusion <b>904</b>, and the occlusive device <b>908</b> is activated to prevent downstream migration of particles and debris (FIG. <b>52</b>F). Therapy can then be performed on the occlusion <b>904</b>, if desired. For example, an angioplasty catheter <b>910</b> can be delivered to the occlusion <b>904</b> and the balloon inflated to open the vessel (FIG. <b>52</b>G). Stenting therapy may also be used. After therapy, the aspiration catheter <b>906</b> can be reintroduced to the site to perform further aspiration of particles and debris created during therapy (FIG. <b>52</b>H). This aspiration may occur in a similar manner as described above, with the distal end of the aspiration catheter moving in a proximal to distal direction across the occlusion <b>904</b> while aspirating, and then in a distal to proximal direction across the occlusion <b>904</b>. After aspiration, the occlusive device is deactivated. If desired, TIMI flow is again determined after therapy and aspiration.</p>
  <p num="p-0182">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 53A-G</figref>, the second preferred method of the invention is used especially for partially occluded vessels, defined by TIMI flow of 1-2, having no major side branch. However, as above, the method of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 53A-G</figref> is not intended to be limited only to such applications. A guidewire <b>907</b> with an occlusive device such as a balloon at its distal end <b>908</b> is inserted into the vessel <b>902</b> to a location just proximal to the occlusion <b>904</b> (FIG. <b>53</b>A). An aspiration catheter <b>906</b> is delivered over the guidewire <b>908</b> so that the distal ends of the guidewire <b>908</b> and aspiration catheter <b>906</b> are both just proximal to the occlusion <b>904</b> (FIG. <b>53</b>B). Aspiration is performed while crossing or advancing past the occlusion <b>904</b> with the distal ends of the guidewire <b>908</b> and aspiration catheter <b>906</b>, in a proximal to distal direction (FIG. <b>53</b>C). Then the distal end of the aspiration catheter <b>906</b> is moved back in a distal to proximal direction while aspirating (FIG. <b>53</b>D). Blood flow into the aspiration catheter <b>906</b> is indicated by the arrows. The proximal to distal, then distal to proximal aspiration may be repeated one or more times if desired.

  <p num="p-0183">The occlusive device on the guidewire <b>908</b> is then activated to prevent downstream migration of particles and debris (FIG. <b>53</b>E).

For example, an angioplasty catheter <b>910</b> can be delivered to the occlusion <b>904</b> over the guidewire and the balloon inflated to open the vessel (FIGS. <b>53</b>F-G). Stenting therapy may also be used. The aspiration catheter <b>906</b> is then reintroduced to the site to perform further aspiration of particles and debris created during therapy (FIG. <b>53</b>G).

In the event that any pieces or particles of plaque are knocked off of the occlusion formed by the stenosis <b>1076</b> by movement of the guide wire <b>1046</b> through the same, such pieces of plaque or emboli will be drawn out with the reverse flow of blood into the aspiration lumen <b>1026</b> and out of the aspiration fitting <b>1027</b>. During the time that the guide wire <b>1046</b> is being advanced through the stenosis <b>1076</b> it may be desirable at the same time to introduce a saline solution through the guide wire lumen <b>1043</b> of the second elongate flexible tubular member <b>1031</b> to exit through the distal extremity of the second elongate flexible tubular member <b>1031</b> into the space immediately proximal of the stenosis <b>1076</b>. This introduced saline solution aids the flow of particulate or other particles dislodged from the stenosis <b>1076</b> during advancement of the guide wire <b>1046</b> through the same and carries them back with the mixed saline blood solution through the aspiration lumen <b>1026</b> in a manner hereinbefore described.</p>
  <p num="p-0199">With the guide wire <b>1046</b> remaining in position, the second elongate flexible tubular member <b>1031</b> with the second balloon <b>1036</b> thereon in a deflated condition is advanced over the guide wire <b>1046</b> through the stenosis <b>1076</b> until the second balloon <b>1036</b> is distal of the stenosis <b>1076</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60D</figref> after which the second balloon <b>1036</b> is inflated by introducing an inflation medium as for example a radiopaque liquid through the inflation fitting <b>1042</b> into the lumen <b>1039</b> through the port <b>1041</b> to the interior of the second balloon <b>1036</b> to inflate the second balloon <b>1036</b> until it engages the sidewall of the vessel <b>1067</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0200">Prior to, during or after inflation of the second balloon <b>1036</b>, the guide wire <b>1046</b> can be removed. However, it is preferable to remove the guide wire <b>1046</b> as soon as the second balloon <b>1036</b> has been advanced so that it is beyond the stenosis <b>1076</b>. At this time, and certainly prior to complete inflation of the second balloon <b>1036</b>, blood is shunted across the stenosis <b>1076</b> and into the lumen <b>1068</b> distal of the second balloon <b>1036</b> by introducing blood through the fitting <b>1038</b> and into the centrally disposed blood flow lumen <b>1037</b> in the second tubular member <b>1031</b> so that it exits out the central lumen <b>1037</b> distal of the second balloon <b>1036</b>. The blood which is supplied to the fitting <b>1037</b> can be taken from another femoral artery of the patient and pumped into the fitting <b>1038</b>. In addition, if desired, the blood which is aspirated in the space distal of the first balloon <b>1019</b> can be appropriately filtered and also supplied to the fitting <b>1038</b>. By shunting blood past the stenosis <b>1069</b> in this manner it can be seen that blood is being continuously supplied to the carotid artery of the patient during the time that the second balloon <b>1036</b> is inflated and occludes the lumen <b>1068</b> in the vessel <b>1067</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0201">As soon as the second balloon <b>1036</b> has been inflated, it can be seen that there is provided a working space <b>1078</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60D</figref>) between the first and second balloons <b>1019</b> and <b>1036</b> so that medical procedures can be undertaken to remove or reduce the stenosis <b>1076</b> in the space between the first and second balloons <b>1019</b> and <b>1036</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0202">Assuming that it is desired to compress the plaque or material forming the stenosis <b>1076</b> to provide a larger lumen,-opening or passageway through the stenosis <b>1076</b>, the third tubular member <b>1051</b> can be advanced by grasping the proximal extremity <b>1052</b> to cause the distal extremity with the third balloon <b>1058</b> thereon to be advanced into the space <b>1078</b>. As soon as the balloon <b>1058</b> has been properly positioned within the stenosis <b>1076</b>, the balloon <b>1058</b> also can be inflated with a suitable inflation medium as for example a radiopaque liquid. The balloon <b>1058</b> can be inflated to the desired pressure to cause compression of the plaque of the occlusion against the sidewall of the vessel <b>1067</b> by the application of appropriate pressure. As in conventional angioplasty procedures, the third balloon <b>1058</b> can be formed of a non-elastic relatively non-compliant material so that high pressures as for example 10-15 atmospheres can be used within the balloon to apply compressive forces to the vessel without danger of rupturing the vessel. It should be appreciated that the non-elastic capabilities can also be achieved by a composite elastic material.</p>
  <p num="p-0203">Since the blood flow has been restored to the vessel <b>1067</b> by the shunt hereinbefore described, the compression of the occlusion forming the stenosis <b>1076</b> can be carried out for an extended period of time, as for example after a few minutes, if desired to help ensure that a large lumen or passageway is formed through the stenosis <b>1076</b> as shown in FIG. <b>60</b>E. If it is believed that the occlusion forming the stenosis <b>1069</b> has been sufficiently compressed, the third balloon <b>1058</b> can be deflated. In the event an inelastic balloon is utilized for the third balloon <b>1058</b>, and it is desired to utilize a larger third balloon, this can be accomplished by removing the third tubular member <b>1051</b> with the deflated balloon <b>1058</b> thereon and introducing a third tubular member <b>1051</b> having a larger size balloon thereon over the second tubular member <b>1031</b> and advancing it into the stenosis <b>1076</b> and inflating the larger size balloon to create a still larger passage through the stenosis <b>1076</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0204">After the appropriate dilation the stenosis <b>1076</b> has been accomplished the third balloon can be removed from the stenosis while aspiration of the space <b>1078</b> is still ongoing so that any plaque coming off the occlusion forming the stenosis <b>1076</b> can be aspirated out of the vessel. After the third balloon <b>1058</b> has been removed from the stenosis, the second balloon <b>1036</b> and the first balloon <b>1019</b> can be deflated to permit normal blood flow through the vessel <b>1061</b> after which the arterial blood flow supply to the fitting <b>1038</b> can be terminated. The entire catheter assembly <b>1011</b> can then be removed from the guiding catheter <b>1063</b> after which the guiding catheter <b>1063</b> can be removed and a suture applied to the incision created to obtain access to the femoral artery.</p>
