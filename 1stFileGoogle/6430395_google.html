standard cordless phones (handsets), particularly, mobile devices utilizing the Bluetooth short-range wireless communication protocol. The methods provide seamless and reliable handoff of sessions between Base Stations while the mobile device is moving between picocells, by implementing a high-level of synchronization between the Base Stations and the Switch. Base Stations of picocells having small coverage areas communicate with the handsets. The communication protocol is divided into a low-level protocol performed by the Base Stations and a high-level protocol performed by the Switch connected to all the Base Stations. The methods support mobile computing or telephony devices and communication protocols, which are not specified to handle handoffs of sessions while moving between Base Stations coverage areas in a data, voice or telephony wireless network.</div>

    <p>This application claims benefit of Provisional No. 60/195,219 filed Apr. 7, 2000 and claims benefit of Provisional No. 60/208,306 filed Jun. 1, 2000.</p>
    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The invention relates to wireless communications systems having a plurality of mobile units (devices) having the ability to connect short-range with a plurality of Base Stations, and techniques for handing off a mobile unit from one Base Station to another when the mobile unit moves between areas of coverage of neighboring Base Stations.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The effective range of a mobile device, such as a cordless handset, from its Base Station is limited by its transmission power and by the receiver sensitivity of the mobile device and the Base Station. Wireless Private Branch Exchange (WPBX) systems address this limitation by using more than one Base Station (BS). The area that a Base Station covers is called a cell. In the main, hereinafter, mobile units (devices) that are cordless (telephone) handsets are discussed.</p>
    <p>In a WPBX, the Base Stations are interconnected in order to allow handsets that are in different cells to communicate with one another. When a handset moves from one cell to another during a call, the handoff (or handover) of communication from one Base Station to another Base Station enables uninterrupted communication. A central unit that is usually called the “Switch” is connected to all the Base Stations. The Switch controls the operation of the system, routes the call to Base Stations and to Gateways, which connect the WPBX to external communication systems. The transmission power of a cordless handset in the WPBX is usually lower than the transmission power of the handset of a standard cellular system, which results in a WPBX for cordless handsets having much smaller cells (referred to as mini-cells, or micro-cells or picocells) than the cells of a standard cellular system.</p>
    <p>Some cordless handsets use communication protocols that are also used in cellular system, but they transmit in a lower power than a mobile (cellular) handset. For examples protocols in use are GSM and IS-136. According to these protocols the handoff between cells is performed by collaboration of the cordless handset, the Base Stations and the Switch. These handsets can connect to the WPBX when they are in its coverage area, and can also connect to any other cellular system that supports the communication protocol that they are using.</p>
    <p>Some handsets use communication protocols that were designed especially to allow communication with WPBX. Some examples are DECT, CT-2, PAC, and PACS. The handset is usually a dedicated handset that is used only in the area covered by the WBPX.</p>
    <p>Some handsets have dual mode support. For example a handset may communicate with the WPBX using DECT, and may allow communication with other cellular systems using GSM.</p>
    <p>Some WPBXs use standard cordless handsets. These handsets have no special mechanism to support the handoff between cells. In these systems the Switch and the Base Stations perform the handoff, and the handset is not aware of (does not participate actively in) the handoff process. When a standard cordless handset moves from one cell to another the Switch routes the call to another cell. Since cordless phones use “simple” protocols, for example an analog fixed transmission, when the call is routed to the new cell, the cordless phone automatically will receive it.</p>
    <p>During the last years short-range communication protocols have become much more complicated. Very low power is used in order to allow many systems to operate in close vicinity. Complex transmissions methods like frequency hopping and spread spectrum are used in order to overcome interference, and improve the communication quality. Digital communication methods are used allowing communication of data and voice on the same system. Error correction encoders are used in order to improve reliability. Security and privacy of the communication is improved with the use of Digital authentication and encryption.</p>
    <p>Short-range communication systems are used for many purposes. A growing trend for short-range communication usage is Personal Area Network (PAN) devices and applications, among such is the “all in one handset” and personal data devices. Such type of handset supports standard cellular communication, and also has the ability to communicate with personal area network devices that are in its near vicinity, using short-range communication. Some PAN short-range communication standards were not designed to allow mobility, i.e. they were not designed to allow handoff in between Base Stations in general and during an active session in particular. This limits a session via such device to be linked to a single Base Station and therefore to very limited area.</p>
    <p>The “Bluetooth” standard is a short-range wireless communication standard that has many uses for voice applications and telephony (e.g. cordless phone, wireless headsets) and also for data applications (laptop to personal computer communication, wireless local area network Gateways etc.). The Bluetooth wireless technology is implemented using a universal radio interface in the 2.45 GHz frequency band that enables portable electronic devices to connect and communicate wirelessly via short-range, ad hoc networks. Each unit can simultaneously communicate with up to seven other units per piconet. Moreover, each unit can simultaneously belong to several piconets.</p>
    <p>Bluetooth connection is planned to be standard feature in future cellular handsets, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), Palmtop and Laptop computers. The Bluetooth standard does not support mobility between Base Stations, since it was primarily designed for short-range communication as a cable replacement. A cellular handset with Bluetooth wireless technology will be able to operate as a cordless phone, but only in the near vicinity of a single Base Station. The same limitation applies to mobile personal data devices such as PDA's and mobile computers.</p>

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>A general object of the invention is to provide a technique for allowing mobile units (devices) such as standard cordless telephone handsets and PDA (Personal Digital Assistant), laptop or notebook computers or similar devices that support wireless communication (such as Bluetooth wireless technology) to seamlessly connect to a Wireless Private Branch Exchange (WPBX), or to a standard (wired) PBX or to a LAN or to a cellular telephone network or to a standard wired telephone network, thereby avoiding the use of special (typically expensive) handsets or attachments or software or hardware agents , with the abovementioned mobile devices.</p>
    <p>According to the present invention there is provided, in a wireless communication system comprising at least two Base Stations, at least one Switch in communication with the Base Stations, a method of communicating between mobile units and the Base Stations comprising: dividing a communication protocol into a low-level protocol for performing tasks that require accurate time synchronization and a high-level protocol which does not require accurate time synchronization; and for each connection of a mobile unit with a Base Station, running an instance of the low-level protocol at the Base Station connected with the mobile unit and running an instance of the high-level protocol at the Switch.</p>

    <p>According to the present invention there is provided, in a wireless communication system comprising a Base Station connected with a mobile unit, a method of detecting the presence of a specific mobile unit in a coverage area of at least one neighboring Base Station, comprising: the Base Station connected with the mobile unit provides, to the at least one neighboring Base Station, information about the connection with the mobile unit, including rough TOD and a device address for the mobile unit; at the at least one neighboring Base Station, receiving information and generating a list of frequencies in which the mobile unit is likely to transmit; and at the at least one neighboring Base Station, checking for a signal transmitted by the mobile unit.</p>
    <p>According to the present invention there is provided a method for detecting a mobile unit by a Base Station, wherein frequency-hopping is used to communicate between Base Stations and mobile units, comprising: at a Base Station that is connected to a mobile unit, periodically yielding a hop; and during the hop which has been yielded by the Base Station connected with the mobile unit, communicating with the mobile unit from at least one neighboring Base Station.</p>
    <p>According to the present invention there is provided, in a wireless communication system comprising a Base Station connected with a mobile unit, a method of detecting a handset by at least one Base Station which is waiting for the mobile unit to enter its coverage area, comprising: from the at least one Base Station waiting for the mobile unit to enter its coverage area and the Base Station connected with the mobile unit, sending a PING command to the mobile unit; and at the Base Station waiting for the mobile unit to enter its coverage area, receiving an ECHO reply from the mobile unit.</p>
    <p>According to the present invention there is provided, in a wireless communication system comprising at least two Base Stations, at least one Switch in communication with the Base Stations, and at least one mobile unit, a method of handing off the mobile unit from a Base Station communicating with the mobile unit and a neighboring Base Station, comprising: smoothing a plurality of signals received from a handset by a plurality of Base Stations; comparing the signals with one another; and selecting a Base Station for handoff based on signal quality.</p>
    <p>According to the present invention there is provided, in a wireless communication system comprising at least two Base Stations and at least one Switch in communication with the Base Stations, a method of performing handoff of a session from a Base Station connected with a mobile unit to a neighboring Base Station, wherein an instance of a low-level communications protocol is running at the Base Station connected with the mobile unit, comprising: at the Switch, determining when to perform handoff to a selected one of the neighboring Base Stations; at the selected one of the neighboring Base Stations, creating a copy of the low-level communications protocol, including at least a synchronized time of day (TOD) parameter; from the Switch, sending a command to stop communication with the mobile unit at a specified TOD to the Base Station connected with the mobile unit and sending a command to start communication with the mobile unit at the specified TOD to the selected one of the neighboring Base Stations; and updating session status tables in the Switch and in the Base Stations.</p>
    <p>According to the present invention there is provided, in a wireless communication system comprising a Base Station connected with a mobile unit, a method of detecting and synchronizing with the mobile unit prior to receiving a handoff of a session with the mobile unit, comprising: from the Base Station connected with the mobile unit, sending rough synchronization information to at least one neighboring Base Station; at the neighboring Base Station, performing a wide-range search for “target” signals having the correct timing for a mobile unit, based on the rough synchronization information provided by the Base Station which is connected with the mobile unit; narrowing the search for an actual signal from the mobile unit; acquiring the target signal; and synchronizing the neighboring Base Station to the Base Station connected with the mobile unit.</p>
    <p>According to the present invention, a system comprises one or more mobile units such as standard cordless handsets, two or more Base Stations, and at least one Switch. The Base Stations are connected to one another and to the Switch. The handsets communicate directly with the Base Stations, rather than with one another.</p>
    <p>According to an aspect of the present invention, the Base Stations and Switch communicate directly with one another, rather than, for example, over the PSTN. However, the system may interface with the PSTN, the Internet or a LAN, or with a PBX via a Gateway.</p>
    <p>According to a feature of the present invention, a method is provided for handing off calls from a one Base Station to another (neighboring) Base Station, with mobile units (e.g., standard cordless handsets) that do not support connection to more than one Base Station and that do not support mobility with seamless handoff between Base Stations. This is an important feature because the mobile device uses complicated digital communication methods, so simple handoff methods that only the Switch supports are inadequate. Rather, the Switch and Base Stations cooperate with one another for the handoff operation. Accurate synchronization of Base Stations facilitates handoff. Advantageously, the handoff operation does not require explicit cooperation between the mobile device and the Base Stations.</p>
    <p>According to an aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for dividing the short-range communication protocol that is used by the handset between high-level protocols which do not need accurate time synchronization and low-level protocols which have strict time synchronization requirements (require accurate time synchronization). The low-level protocols are performed by the Base Stations, and the high-level protocols are performed in the Switch. This enables handoff to be performed even when complex (e.g. frequency hopping, encryption, authentication) and multi-level protocols are used. This also reduces the synchronization requirements between Base Stations.</p>
    <p>According to an aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for accurately synchronizing the Base Stations and, more particularly, for synchronizing the Base Stations when frequency-hopping communication is used.</p>
    <p>According to an aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for detecting the presence of a mobile device in the coverage area of a Base Station (i.e., its picocell).</p>
    <p>According to an aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for determining when to perform handoff of a session(i.e., a phone call, a data link, etc.), and to which Base Station to hand the session, by measuring signal quality at the Base Stations. This method is effective, even when complex transmission methods are used.</p>
    <p>The methods disclosed herein are not limited to the communication of a certain type of data. Hence, they can be utilized for telephony applications and for data applications.</p>
    <p>Other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become apparent in light of the following description thereof.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>FIG. 1 illustrates the basic components and operation of an exemplary, overall communication system <b>100</b>. A Base Station <b>101</b> of a cellular system covers a cell <b>111</b> having a relatively large coverage area <b>111</b>. (The Base Station <b>101</b> is shown off-center in its coverage area <b>111</b>, and the coverage area <b>111</b> is shown as elliptical rather than circular, for illustrative clarity.) Base Stations <b>107</b>, <b>108</b> and <b>109</b> of a WPBX system cover cells <b>102</b>, <b>103</b> and <b>104</b>, respectively, each having relatively smaller coverage areas. (The Base Stations <b>107</b>, <b>108</b> and <b>109</b> are shown off-center in their respective coverage areas <b>102</b>, <b>103</b> and <b>104</b>, for illustrative clarity.) Sometimes, these smaller cells <b>102</b>, <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> are referred to as “microcells”, or “picocells”, or “minicells”.</p>
    <p>A mobile handset <b>110</b> can communicate with the cellular Base Station <b>101</b> via a communication link <b>105</b> and, when it is in the coverage area of the WPBX, it also can use short-range communication link <b>106</b>, to communicate with one of its Base Stations <b>107</b>, <b>108</b> and <b>109</b>. In this manner, a standard cellular handset <b>110</b>, that is enhanced (additionally equipped) with a short-range communication link (e.g. Bluetooth wireless technology) can connect with the WPBX system whenever it is in range of one of the WPBX Base Stations <b>107</b>, <b>108</b> and <b>109</b>.</p>
    <p>The WPBX system can also operate when there is no cellular coverage at all. And the handset <b>110</b> can be an ordinary cordless telephone handset. Therefore, the cellular Base Station <b>101</b> shown in FIG. 1 is optional, insofar as the WPBX system of the present invention is involved. In the main hereinafter, a handset which is an otherwise ordinary cordless telephone handset, equipped with a short-range communication link (e.g. Bluetooth wireless link) will be used to describe the invention.</p>
    <p>In an office environment, a WPBX system improves availability of employees, who carry mobile handsets, and therefore reduces operational cost and increases productivity. In the home environment, a WPBX system enables the use of the standard cellular handsets instead of special cordless phones.</p>
    <p>In the present invention, when the handset is the same as the cellular handset, the cost of equipment is lower then the cost of a standard WPBX which requires dedicated handsets. Since the WPBX handles calls between handsets connected to it, the communication charges are lower then when standard cellular communication is used for all the calls.</p>
    <p>The handset <b>110</b> may indicate to the user that more then one service is available. The user decides which service to use (Cellular or WPBX). The ability to choose between services is a well-known feature in many mobile phones.</p>
    <p>It should be understood that the handset <b>110</b> is merely an example of a “mobile unit” which can be any of a number of telephony, voice, computing or data devices which communicate via Base Stations, as described in greater detail hereinbelow. As used herein, “Mobile Units” are devices communicating wirelessly with (also referred to as “connected to”) Base Stations.</p>
    <p>As illustrated in FIG. 1 (and ignoring the cellular Base Station <b>101</b> and link <b>105</b>) the handset <b>110</b> is currently communicating with (connected to) the Base Station <b>108</b>. The Base Stations <b>107</b> and <b>109</b> are each referred to as “neighboring” Base Stations since they are each adjacent to the Base Station <b>108</b> that the handset is currently connected to. The present invention deals largely with how communication with a Mobile Unit such as a handset is handed off (or passed off) from a one Base Station to another (neighboring) Base Station when the handset moves from one minicell to another minicell.</p>
    <p>FIG. 2 illustrates the main components and architecture of a WPBX system <b>200</b> suitable for use as the WPBX system of FIG. <b>1</b>. The architecture of a WPBX system generally resembles the architecture of a cellular system. However, as described in greater detail hereinbelow, the function that each component performs is different, since the current invention deals with short-range communication with mobile units that have no built-in support for handoff.</p>
    <p>The WPBX <b>200</b> comprises a plurality (three shown) of Base Stations <b>123</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>125</b>. A handset <b>121</b> communicates via a short-range communication link <b>122</b> (e.g. Bluetooth wireless link) with Base Station #1 <b>123</b>. Base Station #2 <b>124</b> and Base Station #3 <b>125</b> are ready to receive the call should handset <b>121</b> move into their coverage area. At the same time, the other Base Stations may participate in calls with other handsets. For example, Base Station #2 <b>124</b> communicates via a short-range communication link <b>134</b> (e.g. Bluetooth wireless link) with a handset <b>133</b>. The handsets <b>121</b> and <b>133</b> may communicate with each other via the WPBX (as opposed to directly with one another), as described in greater detail hereinbelow.</p>
    <p>Communication links <b>126</b>, <b>127</b>, <b>128</b> connect the Base Stations <b>123</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>125</b> with one another, as illustrated. These communications links transfer data between the Base Stations <b>123</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>125</b>, including voice communication, data communication, connection status information and synchronization information, as described in greater detail hereinbelow, and may be RF links or land lines (e.g., copper wires, optical fibers, etc.).</p>
    <p>Communication links <b>130</b>, <b>131</b>, <b>132</b> connect the Base Stations <b>123</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>125</b>, respectively, with a Central Switch (hereinafter “Switch”) <b>129</b>. These communication links enable the Switch <b>129</b> to control the operation of the Base Stations and to participate in the higher levels of the communication protocols, as described in greater detail hereinbelow, and may be RF links or land lines.</p>
    <p>FIG. 3A illustrates the addition of a Gateway <b>135</b> to the WPBX system <b>200</b> of FIG. <b>2</b>. The Gateway <b>135</b> connects the Switch <b>129</b> to a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) <b>136</b>. This enables the WPBX system <b>200</b> to receive incoming calls from and to send outgoing calls to other telecommunication systems (not shown) which are connected to the PSTN. The Gateway <b>135</b> may be implemented in any suitable manner, such as in hardware and/or software.</p>
    <p>As used herein, a “Gateway” is a logical or physical connection between two different communication networks. The term implies a need for conversion of some aspect of the information or communication in order to operate, as contrasted with a “port” which implies a point not requiring significant conversion of the message or information. Gateways are well known.</p>
    <p>FIG. 3B illustrates the addition of a Gateway <b>137</b> to the WPBX system <b>200</b> of FIG. <b>2</b>. The Gateway <b>137</b> connects the Switch <b>129</b> to a standard Private Branch Exchange (PBX) <b>138</b>. This enables the WPBX system <b>200</b> to receive incoming calls from and to send outgoing calls to standard telephone sets <b>139</b> connected to the PBX <b>138</b>. As illustrated, the PBX <b>138</b> is interfaced with the PSTN <b>136</b>. Thus, the WPBX system <b>200</b> can also communicate with other telecommunication systems (not shown) which are connected to the PSTN.</p>
    <p>Having dedicated connections for all the Base Stations <b>123</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>125</b> and the Switch <b>129</b>, such as illustrated in FIG. 2, hereinabove, is generally not cost-effective. Rather, when real time interaction or synchronization is not required, a shared local network, for example a local area network such as the IEEE 802.2 Ethernet, can connect these units in a cost-effective manner.</p>
    <p>FIG. 4 illustrates a plurality (three shown) of Base Stations <b>123</b>, <b>124</b> and <b>125</b> (compare FIG. 2) connected via a communications link which is a Local Area Network (LAN) <b>140</b> which handles the transfer of information between the Base Stations <b>123</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>125</b>, the Switch <b>129</b> and, in this example, the Gateway <b>135</b> to the PSTN <b>136</b>. Using a standard local area network (LAN) as the communication backbone allows simple integration with other telephony application servers (not shown), such as IVR (interactive voice response), voice loggers, voice mail and billing systems. The LAN <b>140</b> can be either wired, or wireless.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 2, <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B and <b>4</b> therefore illustrate, in a general manner, a number of ways in which the main components of a WPBX can be connected with one another, and interfaced with other communications systems (PSTN, PBX, etc.)</p>
    <p>For office WPBX applications the Switch <b>129</b> may be a standard computer that has the processing power required for handling the switching of hundreds of calls simultaneously. It should support operation in a multi-server environment. This can be achieved with standard server hardware. For home WPBX applications, the Switch <b>129</b> may be a part of one Base Station, or a part of several Base Stations.</p>
    <heading>Call Setup Procedures</heading> <p>FIGS. 5, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> illustrate call setup procedures for a single call at an “originating” Base Station (e.g., <b>123</b>), at a “receiving” Base Station (e.g., <b>124</b>), and at the Switch (e.g., <b>129</b>), respectively. Call setup between the handset (e.g., <b>121</b>) and the Base Station it is connected to (e.g., <b>123</b>) is suitably performed according to standard telephony protocols, for example ITU-T Q.931. A similar protocol is a part of the Bluetooth protocol stack. However, the present invention is not limited to a specific protocol for call setup.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5 illustrates a call setup procedure performed by an originating Base Station (e.g. <b>123</b>) when a handset (e.g., <b>121</b>) that is connected to it, tries to initiate a call. As shown in the step <b>151</b>, the handset that is originating the call sends a destination number (DN). In a next step <b>152</b>, the originating Base Station (e.g., <b>123</b>) checks whether the destination handset (e.g., <b>133</b>) is in its “Base Station Connection Table”—in other words, whether the destination handset is in the originating Base Station's coverage area. If not (step <b>152</b>, “N”), in a step <b>160</b> the destination number (DN) is sent via the communications link (e.g., LAN <b>140</b>) to the central WPBX Switch (e.g., <b>129</b>). The originating Base Station then sets a timeout (step <b>161</b>), and waits for a reply from the Switch. The timeout set in the step <b>161</b> is suitably on the order of up to 5 seconds. Next, it is determined in a step <b>162</b> whether there is a timeout.</p>
    <p>If there is a timeout (step <b>162</b>, “Y”), the Base Station sends a busy indication (suitably a tone) to the originating handset (step <b>177</b>), and the Switch is updated about the failure of the call (step <b>178</b>). If, there is not a timeout (step <b>162</b>, “N”), the originating Base Station receives (from the Switch) the address of a destination Base Station (step <b>163</b>). The originating Base Station then calls the destination Base Station (step <b>164</b>), and it also calls all the neighbors (neighboring Base Stations) of the destination Base Station (step <b>180</b>). Then the originating Base Station sets a timeout (step <b>165</b>) and waits for a reply from the called Base Station (and its neighbors). Calling more then one destination Base Station is preferred in order to overcome uncertainties during handoff. The timeout set in the step <b>165</b> is suitably on the order of up to 5 seconds. Next, it is determined in a step <b>166</b> whether there is a timeout.</p>
    <p>If there is a timeout (step <b>166</b>, “Y”), the Base Station sends a busy tone to the originating handset (step <b>177</b>), and the Switch is updated about the failure of the call (step <b>178</b>). If, there is not a timeout (step <b>166</b>, “N”), and a reply from the destination Base Station is received, the originating Base Station checks if the call is connected (step <b>167</b>), and then connects the originating handset (step <b>168</b>), and updates the Switch about the success of the call (step <b>169</b>).</p>
    <p>If, in the step <b>163</b> the address of a destination Base Station is not received (N), it is determined (step <b>170</b>) whether the destination of the call is the Switch itself. If so (step <b>170</b>, “Y”), a procedure similar to that for sending a call to another Base Station is implemented, except that the call is sent to the Switch (step <b>171</b>) and not to another Base Station. Then the originating Base Station sets a timeout (step <b>172</b>) and waits for the Switch to reply (step <b>173</b>). The timeout is suitably on the order of up to 5 seconds. Next, it is determined in the step <b>173</b> whether there is a timeout.</p>
    <p>If there is a timeout (step <b>173</b>, “Y”), the Base Station sends a busy tone to the originating handset (step <b>177</b>), and the Switch is updated about the failure of the call (step <b>178</b>). If the Switch responds that the call is connected, there is not a timeout (step <b>173</b>, “N”), and the originating Base Station connects the handset (step <b>175</b>), and updates the Switch (step <b>176</b>) about the status of the call.</p>
    <p>If it is determined that the destination handset is in the originating Base Station's coverage area (step <b>152</b>, “Y”), and a busy signal is not returned (step <b>153</b>, “N”), the originating Base Station then attempts (step <b>154</b>) to connect the call to the destination handset, and also to all the neighboring Base Stations (step <b>181</b>). Again, the calling of neighboring Base Stations is preferred in order to overcome uncertainties, such as the handset moving, during the call setup. Then the originating Base Station performs a procedure similar to that described hereinabove of setting a timeout (step <b>155</b>), waiting for the Switch to reply (step <b>156</b>), connecting (step <b>158</b>) or disconnecting (step <b>177</b>) the call, and updating the Switch (steps <b>159</b> or <b>178</b>).</p>
    <p>In summary, the call setup procedure performed by an originating Base Station (e.g., <b>123</b>) is that, first, the originating Base Station determines whether a call request from an originating handset (e.g., <b>121</b>) is:</p>
    <p>a. to a DN in the originating Base Station's coverage area (e.g., step <b>152</b>), in which case the originating Base Station attempts (step <b>181</b>) to also connect the call to its neighboring Base Stations; or</p>
    <p>b. to a DN in another Base Station's coverage area (e.g., step <b>164</b>), in which case the originating Base Station attempts (step <b>180</b>) to also connect the call to Base Stations which are neighbors of the destination Base Station; or</p>
    <p>c. to a DN outside of the WPBX coverage area and is to be routed through a Gateway (see FIG. 7) associated with the Switch (steps <b>170</b>, <b>171</b>).</p>
    <p>In each case, the originating Base Station then:</p>
    <p>d. sets a timeout (steps <b>155</b>, <b>165</b>, <b>172</b>);</p>
    <p>e. waits for the Switch to reply (steps <b>156</b>, <b>166</b>, <b>173</b>) that the call is connected (steps <b>157</b>, <b>167</b>, <b>174</b>)</p>
    <p>f. connects the originating handset (steps <b>158</b>, <b>168</b>, <b>175</b>);</p>
    <p>g. updates the Switch (steps <b>159</b>, <b>169</b>, <b>176</b>) about the status of the call; and</p>
    <p>h. waits (step <b>179</b>) for a new event (a new call setup).</p>
    <p>FIG. 6 illustrates the call setup procedure performed at a destination Base Station (e.g., <b>124</b>) which is receiving a call, whether it be from another Base Station or from the Switch. When the destination Base Station receives a request (step <b>201</b>) to connect a call to a handset (e.g., <b>133</b>) which is reportedly within its coverage area, it first checks (step <b>202</b>) whether the handset is already communicating with (connected to) it. If the handset is already connected to the Base Station (step <b>202</b>, “Y”), the Base Station tries to connect the call to the handset. A timeout is set (step <b>203</b>), again on the order of up to 5 seconds, and the Base Station waits (step <b>204</b>).</p>
    <p>If a time-out occurs (step <b>204</b>, “Y”), or if a timeout does not occur (step <b>204</b>, “N”) but the call was unable to connect (step <b>205</b>, “N”), the destination Base Station returns an indication (step <b>208</b>) of call setup failure (“unable to connect”) to the originating Base Station (or to the Switch, as the case may be). If, however, the connection succeeds (step <b>205</b>, “Y”) the Base Station returns an indication (step <b>206</b>) of successful call setup (“call connected”) to the originating Base Station. In either case (call connected, unable to connect), the destination Base Station sends similar indications (steps <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>, respectively) to all the neighboring Base Stations of the originating Base Station Again, sending the reply to the neighboring Base Stations is to overcome uncertainties during handoff. In both cases the Switch is updated at steps <b>207</b> and <b>209</b>, respectively. Finally the Base Station waits (step <b>210</b>) for a new event (a new call setup).</p>
    <p>FIG. 7 illustrates the call setup procedure performed at the Switch (e.g., <b>129</b>). The Switch handles two types of messages, one is a request to establish a new call, and the other is an update to the status of the call. In a step <b>231</b>, it is determined whether the request is for a new call (step <b>231</b>, “Y”) or a request to update a call (step <b>231</b>, “N”).</p>
    <p>If the arriving message is a request to update a call (step <b>231</b>, “N”), an update of the “Calls Table” is generally required (step <b>254</b>, “Y”). The Switch checks if it receives indication that the call is connected (step <b>255</b>). If the call is connected, (step <b>255</b>, “Y”), the status of the call is updated in the Calls Table (step <b>256</b>). Otherwise (step <b>255</b>, “N”), the call is removed from the Calls Table (step <b>257</b>).</p>
    <p>If the arriving message is a request to initiate a new call (step <b>231</b>, “Y”), the Switch checks if the call is intended to a handset connected to the WPBX (step <b>232</b>). This is done by checking its “Connections Table”. If the call is intended to connect to outside the WPBX (e.g., via the PSTN <b>136</b>), the Switch checks (step <b>233</b>) if the destination number (DN) is a legal (valid) number. If the DN is a valid number (step <b>233</b>, “Y”), in a step <b>234</b> the Switch transfers the call to the Gateway (e.g., <b>135</b>), sets a timeout (step <b>235</b>) and waits (step <b>236</b>). If not (step <b>233</b>, “N”), the program exits.</p>
    <p>If the connection via the Gateway succeeds (step <b>236</b>, “N”), it is whether the call is connected determined (step <b>237</b>). If the call is connected, (step <b>237</b>, “Y”), the Switch requests from the originating Base Station to transfer the call to the Switch(step <b>238</b>), and waits for connection with originating Base Station (steps <b>239</b>, <b>240</b>). If connection succeeds, and the call is connected (step <b>242</b>, “Y”), the call is added to the “Calls Table” (step <b>243</b>), and the call is routed to the Gateway (step <b>244</b>). If connection fails (step <b>240</b>, “Y”; or step <b>242</b>, “N”), the connection with the Gateway is disconnected (step <b>241</b>).</p>
    <p>If the call destination is one of the Base Stations (step <b>259</b>), its source may be another Base Station (step <b>249</b>), or the Gateway (step <b>245</b>). If the source is another Base Station, the Switch send to the originating Base Station the address of the destination Base Station, and adds the call to the “Calls Table”. If the call arrived from the Gateway the Switch tries to connect the call to the destination Base Station (step <b>245</b>). If is succeeds the call is added to the “Calls Table” (step <b>252</b>), the call is transferred to the destination (step <b>253</b>). If it fails the connection with the Gateway is disconnected.</p>
    <p>The procedure described in FIG. 7 is also applicable to the case when more than one Gateway connects to the WPBX to the PSTN—for example, in a case where two branch offices share a single WPBX, and each has its own independent connection to the PSTN. The main difference would be that when the Switch handles an outgoing call, it will determine to which Gateway to send the call. This can either be done randomly, or can be pre-determined. The handling of the incoming calls would proceed as set forth above in FIG. <b>7</b>.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 5, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> have illustrated a call setup procedure for the handling of a single call. When either the Base Stations or the Switch need to handle more then one call, several instances of these procedures can be run in parallel. For that purpose, both Base Station software and Switch software are preferably based on a real time operating system that supports multi-tasking. For each new call, a new task will be created, and the task will perform the procedures described in FIGS. 5, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>. The task will be closed when the procedure is completed.</p>
    <p>In systems with a very large number of Base Stations, due to limited processing power of each Switch, it may be preferable to divide the Switch into two or more units. Dividing the Switch into several units can also improve the reliability of the WPBX, by eliminating the possibility of having a single point of failure shutting down the entire system.</p>
    <p>FIG. 22 illustrates the division of the Base Stations, into two groups; a first group (Group A) <b>1050</b> comprising a plurality (four shown) of Base Stations <b>1050</b> <i>a</i>, <b>1050</b> <i>b</i>, <b>1050</b> <i>c </i>and <b>1050</b> <i>d</i>; and a second group (Group B) <b>1051</b> comprising a plurality (four shown) of Base Stations <b>1051</b> a, <b>105</b> <b>1</b> <i>b</i>, <b>1051</b> <i>c</i>, <b>1051</b> <i>d</i>. The Base Stations of Group A are connected to a first Switch (Switch A) <b>1052</b>, and the Base Stations of Group B are connected to a second Switch (Switch B) <b>1053</b>. The Base Stations and the Switches function according to the procedures described in FIGS. 5, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>. All the Switches mirror all the status tables of the other Switches, i.e. by having copies of each other's “Calls Table” and “Connections Table”. When a Switch updates one of its status tables, it sends the information to all the other Switches, and they update their tables accordingly. In order for this process to be reliable, the other Switches will send an indication that the message was received. If the originating Switch does not receive such a reply within T<sub>1 </sub>milliseconds, it will retransmit the message. The retransmission will be repeated up to P times. For example T<sub>1 </sub>shall be equal to 100, and P shall be equal to 5.</p>
    <p>It is within the scope of the invention that more than two Switches, and corresponding more than two groups of Base Stations can be employed. As described hereinabove, all of the Switches would mirror and update each other's status tables. The description of two Switches <b>1052</b> and <b>1053</b> is intended to be exemplary rather than limiting.</p>
    <heading>Calls Table</heading> <p>The Switch (<b>129</b>) maintains the “Calls Table”, which contains the status and information about all the active calls being handled by the WPBX. The “Calls Table” comprises the following information:</p>
    <p>1) Each active call has a unique “Call Identification number”.</p>
    <p>2) The origin of the call, which can be either “Internal” or “External”.</p>
    <p>3) The destination of the call, which can be either “Internal” or “External”.</p>
    <p>4) “Calling Number Identification (CNID)”, the number of the calling party, if available.</p>
    <p>5) Destination Number (DN), the number of the answering party if available.</p>
    <p>6) “Originating Base Station Identification” for calls from internal origin</p>
    <p>7) “Destination Base Station Identification ” for calls with internal destination,</p>
    <p>8) Status of call—initiated, connected, disconnected.</p>
    <p>9) Additional information for billing, performance analysis, such as call starts time, number of handoffs, time since last handoff, etc.</p>
    <p>The “Originating Base Station Identification” and the “Destination Base Station Identification” are updated when a handset moves from one Base Station to another. The Switch updates these fields when it determines that the handoff should occur. During handoff, for a short time, there may be uncertainty about the validity of these fields. The Base Stations compensate for the uncertainty by “multicasting” the call setup messages to a group of Base Stations, as described hereinabove with respect to FIGS. 5 and 6 (see, e.g., steps <b>180</b>, <b>181</b>, <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>).</p>
    <p>The procedures described above do not limit the WPBX from handling all unique telephony features that the Gateway and the handsets can support. For example, multiple connections can be created between handsets, and between handsets and the Gateway, when each connection is treated as a separate call. Another example is “Caller ID”, that the Gateway can send to a handset. Another example is a “Hook-Flash” (momentary disconnect) that the handset can pass to the Gateway. The WPBX acts as a transparent relay for all these telephony features.</p>
    <heading>High-Level and Low-Level Protocols</heading> <p>In the descriptions set forth hereinabove, it has generally been assumed that:</p>
    <p>1. Each Base Station knows which handsets are in its coverage range.</p>
    <p>2. The Switch is aware of the connections of all the Base Stations.</p>
    <p>3. Connections appear static to users and also to the high-level call setup procedures described above.</p>
    <p>A method to achieve mobility, which fulfills these three assumptions is described in detail, hereinbelow.</p>
    <p>According to the invention, the short-range communication protocol stack is divided into two parts:</p>
    <p>low-level protocols performing real time tasks, and</p>
    <p>high-level protocols that do not have real time requirements.</p>
    <p>For example in the Bluetooth short-range communication protocol stack, the low-level protocols are the radio frequency (RF) transmitter and the base-band controller. The base-band controller performs real time control over the RF, since the Bluetooth protocol utilizes frequency-hopping transmission. The base-band protocol also determines, for each time slot of transmission (i.e. each frequency hop), what information will be transmitted. The base-band protocol also deals with voice coding, error correction, encryption and authentication. For example, higher level protocols of the Bluetooth stack include the “Link Manager” which determines what information will go through the channels created by the “Base-Band”, and determines the state of operation (e.g. Active, Polling, Parked).</p>
    <p>The low-level protocols that require real time capabilities are performed in the Base Station. The higher-level protocols are performed at the Switch. (However, as described hereinbelow, certain high-level protocols can also be performed in the Base Station, even though they do not require real time capabilities.) The Switch handles the routing of data from the higher-level protocols to the lower level protocols. (A call routing task (<b>282</b>) is described in greater detail hereinbelow.) Therefore, the higher-level protocols do not need to “know” in which Base Station the lower level protocol that they are controlling is being performed.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 8A and 8B illustrate an example of a WPBX system <b>800</b> with two handsets <b>121</b> and <b>133</b>, two Base Stations <b>123</b> and <b>124</b>, and one Switch <b>129</b>. In this example, two calls are being handled. Gateways (e.g., <b>135</b>, <b>137</b>) are omitted, for illustrative clarity. As mentioned hereinabove (see, e.g., FIG. <b>22</b>), the Switch can be divided into several units.</p>
    <p>As illustrated in FIG. 8A, the handset <b>121</b> is currently communicating with (connected to) the Base Station <b>123</b>, and the handset <b>133</b> is currently communicating with the Base Station <b>124</b>. An instance <b>280</b> of the low-level protocol is running on the Base Station <b>123</b>, and another instance <b>281</b> of the low-level protocol is running on the Base Station <b>124</b>. Each instance of the low-level protocol supports only one call. In a similar manner, the Switch <b>129</b> handles an instance <b>283</b> of the high-level protocol for the call with the with the handset <b>121</b>, and another instance <b>284</b> of the high-level protocol for the call with the handset <b>133</b>. A single call routing task <b>282</b> handles the data that is transferred between the instances of the low-level protocols and the high-level protocols to the correct destination.</p>
    <p>As illustrated in FIG. 8A, the call routing task <b>282</b> routes data arriving from instance <b>280</b> of the low-level protocol to instance <b>283</b> of the high-level protocol, and from the instance <b>281</b> of the low-level protocol to the instance <b>284</b> of the high-level protocol. Since interaction between the high-level-protocol and low-level protocol, is normally relatively rare (e.g. call setup), there are no strict real time requirements from the call routing task. The call routing task <b>282</b> is described in greater detail hereinbelow, with respect to FIG. <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p>As illustrated in FIG. 8B, the handset <b>133</b> is shown as having moved to the area covered by the Base Station <b>123</b>. The Base Station <b>123</b> will handle the communication with the handset <b>133</b>, by creating a copy <b>281</b>′ of the instance <b>281</b> of the low-level protocol, that previously ran on Base Station <b>124</b>. This allows the handset <b>133</b> to continue communication without “knowing” that a changeover of Base Stations has occurred. The call routing task <b>282</b> will now route the data arriving from the instance <b>281</b>′ of the low-level protocol running on Base Station <b>123</b> to the instance <b>284</b> of the high-level protocol <b>284</b> which is running on the Switch <b>129</b>.</p>
    <p>For each connection of a Base Station with a handset, there is a separate instance of the low-level protocol running at a Base Station connected to the handset, and a corresponding separate instance of the high-level protocol running at the Switch. These instances are created, on an as-needed basis, when a connection is initiated. Preferably, a real time multi-tasking operating system is used in order to allow handling of many instances of the protocols simultaneously in the Base Stations and in the Switch. The procedures that the Switch uses during initiation of a connection and later, during handoff, are discussed in greater detail hereinbelow.</p>
    <heading>Synchronization of Base Stations During a Handoff</heading> <p>There follows a description of procedures that are performed during handoff of a call from one Base Station to another Base Station. The Base Station with which a handset is currently connected is termed the “current” Base Station. The Base Station to which a handset is being handed off is termed the “next” Base Station, and is typically a “neighboring” Base Station. Once the handoff has occurred, this neighboring/next Base Station becomes the “current” Base Station and the Base Station from which the handset has moved becomes the “previous” Base Station.</p>
    <p>According to an aspect of the invention, the handsets do not need to be (and preferably are not) specially equipped or enabled to support mobility (i.e. handoff). Therefore, when a handset moves from one Base Station to another, the current and the next Base Stations are responsible for continuing the communication with the handset, preferably with no noticeable interruption in the communication, and the next Base Station to which the handset has moved should transmit substantially exactly as the previous Base Station from which the handset has moved would have transmitted. For purposes of the discussion of this example, it is assumed that it is known from which Base Station the handset has moved and to which Base Station the handset is moving, and that the exact timing of handoff is also known. These issues are discussed in greater detail hereinbelow.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 9A, <b>9</b>B and <b>9</b>C illustrate, in a general manner, a handoff taking place between two Base Stations <b>123</b>, <b>124</b> and a single handset <b>121</b> of a WPBX.</p>
    <p>FIG. 9A illustrates the handset <b>121</b> communicating with (connected to) a Base Station (Base Station #1) <b>123</b> via a short-range communication link <b>122</b> (e.g. Bluetooth wireless link). The “current” Base Station <b>123</b> sends call parameters and rough synchronization information over the LAN <b>140</b> to the neighboring Base Stations, a one of which is shown as Base Station #2 <b>124</b>. In this manner, the neighboring Base Stations “know” that they are “candidate” Base Stations for receiving a handoff of the call from the current Base Station. The information which is broadcast by the current Base Station to the candidate next Base Stations includes low-level communications protocol states and parameters, discussed in greater detail hereinbelow. This communication from the Base Station <b>123</b> to the Base Stations <b>124</b> is indicated by the arrow <b>141</b>, and the information contained therein is used to achieve rough (coarse) synchronization between the Base Stations. Since this information does not need to be accurate in time, it can be transmitted over the data link (e.g., LAN <b>140</b>) connecting all of the Base Stations.</p>
    <p>FIG. 9B illustrates a handoff as it is about to take place. Here, the handset <b>121</b> is situated in an area covered by both Base Stations <b>123</b> and <b>124</b>. Base Station <b>124</b> uses this situation to achieve exact (fine) synchronization with the current Base Station <b>123</b>. This will enable the next Base Station <b>124</b> to transmit, after the handoff, substantially exactly as previous Base Station <b>123</b> would have transmitted if the handoff had not occurred. A method for effecting this fine synchronization between neighboring Base Stations is discussed in greater detail hereinbelow.</p>
    <p>An important parameter of synchronization is Time Of Day (TOD), which can be determined with virtually any desired level of precision (e.g., microseconds). As described in greater detail hereinbelow, in order to achieve fine synchronization of TOD, the Base Station <b>124</b> that is waiting for the handset <b>121</b> may passively monitor the transmissions of either the handset <b>121</b>, or of the Base Station <b>123</b> that is currently connected with the handset. In FIG. 9B, the two possible fine synchronization signals that the candidate next Base Station #2 <b>124</b> can monitor are shown, a signal <b>142</b> originating from the Base Station #1 <b>123</b>, and another signal <b>143</b> originating from the handset <b>121</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 9C illustrates that synchronization of the Base Stations <b>123</b> and <b>124</b> may alternatively be achieved by use of a beacon signal from a beacon transmitter <b>299</b> which is within range of current and next Base Stations, in which case precise (fine) synchronization for the low-level protocols can also be achieved. The beacon transmitter <b>299</b> transmits a beacon signal <b>144</b> to both of the Base Stations <b>123</b> and <b>124</b> to achieve synchronization of the Base Stations. This method allows for the synchronization of many Base Stations, although only two are illustrated in this figure. In this case, there is no need to transmit synchronization information over the LAN <b>140</b>. Only call parameters (e.g., low-level protocol) need to be communicated between the current Base Station and The neighboring candidate next Base Stations, as indicated by the arrow <b>141</b>′.</p>
    <heading>Bluetooth Short-Range Wireless Communication Protocol</heading> <p>As discussed hereinabove, a short-range communication protocol with the handset can be divided into lower-level protocols which the Base Stations handle, since they have real time requirements, and higher-level protocols which the Switch handles since they do not require real time requirements. Bluetooth wireless technology is an example of such a short-range communication protocol. In Table 1, a division of the Bluetooth short range wireless protocol into such low-level and high-level protocols is presented.</p>

    <p>Table 1 shows the elements of the Bluetooth protocol, generally, as currently implemented. Other profiles may be added in the future (or may have already been added), and it is anticipated that these profiles will be high-level protocols, which do not have strict real time requirements.</p>
    <p>As shown in Table 1, the Link Manager and the Host Controller Interface can be implemented in either the Base Station or in the Switch. Although the Link Manager and Host Controller Interface, do not require real time performance, they may readily be implemented in the base-band controller of the Base-Station. It is within the scope of the invention that any of the high-level protocols can also be implemented in the Base Station as part of the low-level protocol, but then they will take part in the handoff.</p>
    <p>According to the inventive technique of dividing the low-level and high-level protocols, the high-level protocols are “buffered” from the occurrence of handoff by the Base Stations and the routing task that runs on the Switch. Therefore, the present invention allows mobility of any device with Bluetooth wireless technology that supports any of the high-level protocols (e.g. LAN access, WAP, FAX, FTP). The solution for mobility of cordless phones, described hereinabove, is only an example of how the methods can be utilized.</p>
    <p>As described hereinabove with respect to FIGS. 8A and 8B, different instances of the low-level protocols that represent the same connection (e.g., <b>281</b>, <b>281</b>′) need to be synchronized. Table 2, presents elements (parameters) of the low-level protocols that the Base Stations will synchronize. For each element, it also shows whether rough or fine synchronization is required. Again, the protocols are described, by way of example, in the context of the Bluetooth short-range communication protocol.</p>
    <p>Rough synchronization may be achieved via the local area network (see, e.g., LAN <b>140</b>, FIGS. 9A and 9B) connecting the Base Stations. Fine synchronization may be achieved by other methods described in greater detail hereinbelow.</p>

    <p>All the parameters listed in Table 2, except for the TOD, can be sent prior to handoff, thorough the local area network (e.g., LAN <b>140</b>), or any other communication link connecting the Base Stations. As described hereinabove with respect to FIG. 9A, rough (coarse) TOD can also be sent through the LAN.</p>
    <p>If one of the other parts of the Bluetooth protocol stack is also implemented in the Base Station, then it will also take part in the handoff. Synchronizing the instances of the same protocols in different Base Stations is done as described above, by sending internal state parameters via the local area network (LAN <b>140</b>). For example, by implementing the Link Manager and Host Controller Interface in the Base Station, the internal state parameters of these protocols will be broadcast to the neighboring Base Stations, by the Base Station that is connected to the handset.</p>
    <heading>Fine Synchronization</heading> <p>As mentioned hereinabove, in order to achieve fine synchronization of TOD, the Base Station that is waiting for the handset, should passively monitor the transmission of the handset and/or the Base Station that is currently connected with the handset. In FIG. 9B, the two possible signals that the receiving (next) Base Station <b>124</b> can monitor are shown, one originating from Base Station <b>123</b>, and the other originating from the handset <b>121</b> which is currently connected to the Base Station <b>123</b>.</p>
    <p>According to the invention, the next Base Station <b>124</b> can be finely synchronized by receiving synchronization signals from the current Base Station <b>123</b>. Normally, the Base Station <b>124</b> does not receive signals from the Base Station <b>123</b>. Therefore, to facilitate the Base Station <b>124</b> receiving synchronization signals from the Base Station <b>123</b>, Base Station <b>123</b> periodically transmits with higher transmission power than during normal transmission. This allows the Base Station <b>124</b> to receive transmissions from Base Station <b>123</b>, without a substantial increase in spectral contamination. The inventive technique is described in the context of frequency-hopping. Frequency-hopping techniques are well known, including techniques that change frequency with each hop.</p>
    <p>FIG. 10 illustrates a technique for controlling the transmission power of a Base Station (e.g., <b>123</b>) that is currently connected with the handset, for a plurality (series) of successive hops <b>290</b>. The vertical axis of the graph is the Base Station's transmission power (in arbitrary units), and the horizontal axis is time. T<sub>h </sub>is the duration of a hop <b>290</b>. In this example, the hops <b>290</b> all have equal duration. T<sub>p </sub>is the time interval between successive hops (or “hop time slot”) and, in this example, the intervals between successive hops are constant (evenly spaced in time). The normal transmission power for each hop <b>290</b> is P<sub>0</sub>. For example, in a short-range communication system, the normal transmission power P<sub>0 </sub>of a Base Station is suitably on the order of a hundreds of milliwatts.</p>
    <p>According to the invention, in order to effect synchronization between a Base Station and its neighboring Base Stations, every Kth hop <b>290</b>′ is a “synchronization” hop that is transmitted with increased power P<sub>1</sub>. P<sub>1 </sub>is suitably substantially (e.g., 2-10 times) greater than P<sub>0</sub>. In the case that the transmitter changes the transmission frequency in each hop, every Kth (synchronization) hop will also be transmitted at a different frequency.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, it is within the scope of the invention that a variable time interval (Tp) is provided between the synchronization hops <b>290</b>′ that are transmitted with high power P<sub>1</sub>. For example a changing K (that shall be denoted by K(n), i.e. K for hop number ‘n’), can be generated by a pseudo random sequence such as a maximal length shift register sequence. Pseudo random sequences are well known for use in communication systems.</p>
    <p>In the case that a beacon transmitter (e.g., <b>299</b>) is used (in addition to signals received from the Base Station and handset) to synchronize the Base Stations (see, e.g., FIG. <b>9</b>C), it can suitably transmit the beacon signal once in K hops, and K can either be constant or it can be changed over time (variable), as described above.</p>
    <heading>Low-Level Synchronization at the Base Station</heading> <p>FIG. 11 illustrates major components of a Base Station <b>1100</b> waiting for handoff, and a method of accurately synchronizing the TOD at the Base Station to the TOD of the Base Station which the handset is about to leave, including:</p>
    <p>Time Clock <b>310</b>;</p>
    <p>TOD counter <b>303</b>;</p>
    <p>Antenna <b>301</b>;</p>
    <p>Receiver <b>305</b>;</p>
    <p>Frequency Hopping Generator <b>304</b>;</p>
    <p>Emulator <b>307</b>;</p>
    <p>Correlation Detector <b>308</b>; and</p>
    <p>Adder (ADD) <b>309</b>;</p>
    <p>all connected as illustrated in the figure and as discussed hereinbelow.</p>
    <p>As described hereinabove with respect to FIG. 9A, a rough TOD from the Base Station currently connected with the handset is available to the (next) Base Station waiting for a handoff on a communication link such as the LAN <b>140</b>. This rough TOD is provided to the TOD counter <b>303</b> (e.g., via an interface to the LAN <b>140</b>). A Time Clock <b>310</b> generates clock signals for incrementing the TOD counter <b>303</b>. The output of the TOD counter <b>303</b> is therefore a rough estimate of the TOD (“TOD Estimate”). There is an uncertainty (margin of error) “Tu” between the rough estimate of TOD and the actual TOD, and which depends on the transmission latencies thorough the LAN <b>140</b>. “Tu” is readily calculated for a given WPBX system, according to its physical configuration.</p>
    <p>From the rough estimate of the TOD output by the TOD counter and the device address (“Commonly denoted by Media Access Control Address, or MAC address”,), a frequency-hopping list is generated by a frequency-hopping generator <b>304</b> and supplied to an emulator <b>307</b> which emulates the output of the receiver <b>305</b>. In a window with size of 2OT<sub>u</sub>, a single frequency from the hopping sequence is chosen, and the receiver <b>305</b> will wait on this frequency for duration of 2-T<sub>u</sub>. Once in a period of 2-T<sub>u</sub>, the receiver <b>305</b> will switch frequency, in response to a signal generated by the frequency-hopping generator <b>304</b>. Opening an acquisition window of 2-T<sub>u </sub>ensures that during this time duration the receiver <b>305</b> will capture at least one hop. A correlator/detector <b>308</b> receives the receiver's output (e.g. a base-band or intermediate frequency signal) and an emulation <b>307</b> of the signal that should appear at the receiver's output. The output of the receiver <b>305</b> can be emulated, since a rough estimate of the TOD is available, and also from the hopping frequency list, and the receiver frequency list. The emulator <b>307</b> continuously checks for a match between receiver frequency and the hopping frequency and, when it finds a match, it reports the frequency and the time (rough TOD) to the correlator/detector <b>308</b>. By comparing the actual received signal with the emulation that is based on the rough TOD, the correlator <b>308</b> computes (and outputs) a fine estimate of the TOD offset (i.e., the error between the TOD estimate and the actual TOD), and provides this to Adder <b>309</b>, which also receives the rough TOD estimate from the TOD counter <b>303</b> and generates a signal (“Fine TOD”) indicative of the actual TOD. Correlator-based time offset measurement is a standard estimation method that is described in many textbooks, and an example of its implementation is described in greater detail hereinbelow.</p>
    <p>Since the Base Station to which the call is to be handed “knows” which call it is going to receive, and it has received the call parameter (via the LAN), and is able to accurately estimate the TOD, it will be able to perform a seamless handoff, transmitting substantially exactly as the Base Station that the handset is about to leave. As mentioned above, an iteration of the low-level protocol (e.g., <b>281</b>′) can be prepared at the receiving Base Station in anticipation of the handoff.</p>
    <heading>Call Routing Task (<b>282</b>)</heading> <p>The higher-level protocols are run at the Switch, and are therefore “ignorant” of the handoff processes. At the Switch the “call routing task” <b>282</b> (FIGS. 8A, <b>8</b>B) isolates the high-level protocols from the changing environment. The “call routing task” <b>282</b> maintains the “Connections Table”, which contains information about all the connections between handsets and Base Stations. Maintaining the Connections Table is described in greater detail hereinbelow. The following sections describe an example of how the Connections Table is used by the “call routing task” <b>282</b>.</p>
    <p>The following information is included in the Connections Table:</p>
    <p>1) Handset ID</p>
    <p>2) Current Base Station ID</p>
    <p>3) Handle (of instance) of high-level protocols</p>
    <p>4) Handle (of instance) of low-level protocols</p>
    <p>5) Number of candidate Base Stations for handoff</p>
    <p>6) List of candidate Base Stations for handoff</p>
    <p>7) List of Handoff status for each candidate Base Station (i.e., Idle/Started)</p>
    <p>The messages that the high-level protocol (that runs on the Switch) and the low-level protocol (that runs on the Base Station), send each other have the following format:</p>
    <p>1) Message Header</p>
    <p>Origin:</p>
    <p>from low-level protocol</p>
    <p>from high-level protocol</p>
    <p>Handset ID</p>
    <p>Base Station ID</p>
    <p>Low-Level Protocol Handle in the Base Station (number of instance of low-level protocol)</p>
    <p>High-Level Protocol Handle in the Switch, (number of instance of high-level protocol)</p>
    <p>HEC (header error correction)</p>
    <p>2) Message Data</p>
    <p>3) CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)</p>
    <p>FIG. 12 illustrates a method of implementing the “call routing task” <b>282</b> which was mentioned hereinabove with respect to FIG. <b>9</b>A. The “call routing task” <b>282</b> is performed in the Switch <b>129</b>.</p>
    <p>In a first step <b>351</b>, the call routing task <b>282</b> waits for a message from one of the high-level protocol instances running on the Switch <b>129</b> or from one of the low-level protocol instances running on the Base Stations (e.g., <b>123</b>). Then, in a step <b>352</b>, it is determined where the call came from.</p>
    <p>If the message arrived from one of the Base Stations (step <b>352</b>, “Y”), the call parameters are compared with the Connections Table (step <b>353</b>) and the message is sent (step <b>354</b>) to the instance of the high-level protocol running on the Switch (<b>129</b>).</p>
    <p>If the message arrived from the Switch (step <b>352</b>, “N”) the ID of the sending low-level protocol instance is located (step <b>353</b>) in the “Connections Table”, and the message is sent (step <b>354</b>) to an instance of a corresponding high-level protocol. If the message arrived from one of the high-level protocols (step <b>352</b>, “N”), it is determined (step <b>360</b>) whether a handoff has begun (is in progress). If a handoff is not in progress (step <b>360</b>, “N”), the call parameters are compared with the Connections Table (step <b>358</b>) and the message is sent to the Base Station on which the destination low-level protocol instance is running (step <b>359</b>). If a handoff is in progress (step <b>360</b>, “Y”) the call parameters are compared with the Connections Table (step <b>355</b>) and the message is sent to the Base Station on which the destination low-level protocol instance is running (step <b>356</b>). The message is also sent (step <b>357</b>) to all the Base Stations that are candidates for handoff—e.g., neighboring Base Stations. The Base Stations receiving the message can then check if they are running the destination low-level protocol and, if not, the message is simply discarded. The procedure shown in FIG. 12 handles a single message. By using a multi-tasking operating system, it is possible to run several instances of these procedures, and thus handle more than one message simultaneously.</p>
    <heading>Detecting a Handset</heading> <p>The methods described thus far enable the communication protocols to continue operation when a handoff occurs. They rely on the ability to determine, which handset is in the coverage area of which Base Station, where a handset is moving, and when is the best time to perform handoff. By definition, handoff occurs between only two Base Stations, but for a certain time prior to the actual occurrence of the handoff there may be more than one Base Station that are candidates for handoff. Determining the candidates for handoff, which Base Station will actually participate in handoff and when to perform handoff requires collaboration of the Base Stations and the Switch.</p>
    <p>As is evident from the discussions hereinabove, the handsets do not actively participate in the handoff operations. Therefore, the Base Stations will determine which handsets are in their coverage range, by either passively capturing transmission information, or by “tricking” the handset to transmit information that can be used for that purpose.</p>
    <p>As discussed hereinabove, each Base Station will transmit, to all the neighboring Base Stations, information about the calls that are taking place in its coverage area. This information will include all the call parameters that can be sent through a low bandwidth communication link, such as the shared local area network (e.g., LAN <b>140</b>). This information is sufficient for detecting which handset is moving from one of the neighboring Base Stations into the coverage area of a Base Station.</p>
    <p>FIG. 13 illustrates major components of a Base Station <b>1300</b>, waiting for handoff, and a method of accurately synchronizing the TOD at the Base Station to the TOD of the Base Station, which the handset is about to leave, and a passive method for detecting the arrival of a handset in a Base Station's coverage area during a call, including:</p>
    <p>Three TOD counters <b>371</b>, <b>380</b> and <b>384</b> (compare <b>303</b>)</p>
    <p>Antenna <b>382</b> (compare <b>301</b>);</p>
    <p>Receiver <b>379</b> (compare <b>305</b>);</p>
    <p>A Receiver Frequency Controller <b>375</b>;</p>
    <p>Three Hopping Sequence Generators <b>372</b>, <b>373</b> and <b>374</b>;</p>
    <p>Three Emulators <b>376</b>, <b>377</b> and <b>378</b>;</p>
    <p>Three Correlators <b>381</b>, <b>382</b> and <b>383</b> (compare <b>308</b>), all connected as illustrated in the figure and as discussed hereinbelow.</p>
    <p>FIG. 13 illustrates a passive method for determining which handsets' (i.e. handset which is participating in a call with a certain device address) transmissions is being received by a Base Station.</p>
    <p>A plurality (“K”, three shown) of TOD counters <b>371</b>, <b>380</b> and <b>384</b> are set when a rough TOD (“Rough TOD”) estimate is received, via the LAN (<b>140</b>), from other Base Stations. The counters <b>371</b>, <b>380</b> and <b>384</b> are incremented by the TOD clock <b>310</b>. Using the TOD and the device addresses (“Bluetooth Device Address”) that are connected to calls in which handsets in the neighboring cells (connected to neighboring Base Stations) participates, a corresponding plurality (“K”, three shown) of hopping frequency (sequence) generators <b>372</b>, <b>373</b>, <b>374</b> generate the list of frequencies in which the handsets are likely to transmit.</p>
    <p>The receiver frequency controller <b>375</b> sets the frequency, which the receiver <b>379</b> will monitor. A plurality (“K”, three shown) of correlators <b>381</b>, <b>382</b> and <b>383</b> is used to compare the energy at the receiver's output, to the emulation of the receiver's output. The output of the receiver can be emulated, since a rough estimate of the TOD is available, as well as the hopping frequency list, and the receiver frequency list. The emulator continuously checks for a match between receiver frequency and the hopping frequency, when it finds the match it reports to the correlator the frequency and the time. By comparing the actual received signal with the emulation that is based on the rough TOD, the correlator detect the presence of the transmitter and computes a fine estimate of the TOD offset (i.e., the error between the rough TOD estimate and the actual TOD). Correlator-based time offset measurement is a standard estimation method that is described in many textbooks, example of implementation shall be described later on. The number of handsets that can be detected simultaneously is equal to the number of hopping sequence generators, and the number of emulators of receiver output, and the number of correlators.</p>
    <p>In FIG. 13 up to ‘K’ handsets can simultaneously be detected. The main advantage of the method described above is that since the detection is passive, there is no need to achieve fine synchronization between Base Stations. Another advantage of this passive method is that there is no need to decode the messages that the handset transmits, and therefore it is relatively easy to implement.</p>
    <p>The receiver frequency controller <b>375</b> selects the frequency on which the receiver <b>379</b> will wait to “capture” hops. To increase the probability of detection, the receiver frequency controller <b>375</b> should be programmed to choose frequencies that are not blocked by interferences (e.g., interferences from other than Bluetooth transmitters). For each frequency that the receiver frequency controller <b>375</b> chooses, a histogram of the number of hops that have been detected in a certain duration of time, and their average signal-to-noise ratios are maintained by the receiver frequency controller <b>375</b>. A measure of the spectral “cleanness” of a certain frequency can be determined as a function of the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the hops—for example, as the number of hops multiplied by the average signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the hops.</p>
    <p>The receiver frequency controller <b>375</b> preferably chooses a group of ‘M’ frequencies that have the best “cleanness” measure, and the receiver <b>379</b> waits on them most of the time, when once in T1 milliseconds the controller changes the frequency. Once in T2 milliseconds (T2 is selected to be much larger then T1) the receiver frequency controller <b>375</b> selects a frequency which is not in the group of ‘M’ best, and the receiver <b>379</b> waits on it for T3 milliseconds (T3 is selected to be smaller then T1). This enables the receiver frequency controller <b>375</b> to monitor the “cleanness” of frequencies that are not in the ‘M’ best frequencies. If the receiver frequency controller <b>375</b> detects a frequency that is cleaner then one of the ‘M’ frequencies that is in its list, it puts it in the list, instead of the frequency with the lowest “cleanness” measure. Typical values for the parameters M, T1, T2, T3 are 20, 250, 2500, 100, respectively.</p>
    <p>Generally, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or signal-to-interference ratio for each hop is measured by measuring the bursts of energy which match the expected hop duration, to all other signals that do not match the hop duration. The average noise level is continuously monitored. When the energy increases for duration ranging from Th-D to Th+D (Th is the nominal hop duration; D is a measurement “window” interval), the hop energy will be computed, and it will be added to the average hop energy. During the duration of the hop the average noise level is not be updated. Typical values for Th and D, are 0.65 milliseconds, and 1000 milliseconds respectively.</p>
    <heading>Another Method of Detecting a Handset</heading> <p>An alternative method for detecting a handset which enters the coverage area of a Base Station, is now described. This method is also passive, and also relies on a handset being engaged in a call in order to detect the handset. This method requires fine synchronization between the Base Stations and therefore is somewhat more complicated than the passive method previously described, but using this method has a few substantial advantages over the method previously described, including:</p>
    <p>improved detection performance,</p>
    <p>improved timing of handoff, and</p>
    <p>the ability to detect a moving handset that is not currently participating in a call.</p>
    <p>According to the invention, once in a while the Base Station that is currently communicating with the handset will “give up” (omit, yield to its neighbors) a short transmission duration, during which one or more neighboring Base Stations may transmit to the handset. In order for the handset to receive their transmission, the neighboring Base Station(s) must therefore be synchronized with the Base Station that is currently communicating with the handset, and during the time that the neighboring Base Station(s) transmits, it (they) acts as if it were the Base Station that has yielded a transmission slot for handset detection by the neighboring Base Stations.</p>
    <p>This method can be illustrated in the context of the Bluetooth short-range communication, wherein frequency hopping is used. The Base Station that is currently communicating with the handset, will give up a single hop. Any of the neighboring Base Stations that are not close to each other may use the same hop to transmit to the handset. The neighboring Base Stations that are close to each other will use different hops to call (communicate with) the handset. This is illustrated in FIGS. 14A, <b>14</b>B, <b>14</b>C and <b>14</b>D.</p>
    <p>FIG. 14A, which is similar to FIG. 1, illustrates a wireless communication system <b>1400</b> (e.g., WPBX) having a Base Station <b>391</b> that is currently communicating with a mobile unit <b>390</b> that is a wireless telephone handset, and a plurality (six shown) of neighboring Base Stations <b>392</b>, <b>393</b>, <b>394</b>, <b>395</b>, <b>396</b> and <b>397</b> that are waiting (available) for the handset <b>390</b> to enter their coverage areas. Each Base Station <b>391</b>, <b>392</b>, <b>393</b>, <b>394</b>, <b>395</b>, <b>396</b> and <b>397</b> has an area of coverage <b>391</b> <i>a</i>, <b>392</b> <i>a</i>, <b>393</b> <i>a</i>, <b>394</b> <i>a</i>, <b>395</b> <i>a</i>, <b>396</b> <i>a </i>and <b>397</b> <i>a</i>, respectively. The interconnections between the Base Stations, and between the Base Stations and a central Switch, such as shown in FIGS. 2 and 4, are omitted, for illustrative clarity.</p>
    <p>FIG. 14B, which is similar to FIG. 10, illustrates that the Base Station <b>391</b> which is currently communicating with the handset <b>390</b>, periodically (once in K hops) transmits with higher power P<sub>1</sub>, in order to enable the neighboring Base Stations to synchronize their TOD. According to the handset detection technique being discussed, the Base Station <b>391</b> also periodically (once in M hops) skips a transmission on a single hop <b>702</b>, <b>703</b> (shown as dashed lines) in order to allow the neighboring Base Stations <b>392</b>, <b>393</b>, <b>394</b>, <b>395</b>, <b>396</b> and <b>397</b> to transmit at these times. As shown in FIG. 14C, three of the neighboring Base Stations <b>393</b>, <b>395</b>, <b>397</b> transmit on even-numbered skipped hops <b>705</b>. As shown in FIG. 14D, the other three of the neighboring Base Stations <b>392</b>, <b>394</b>, <b>396</b> transmit on odd-numbered skipped hops <b>707</b>. At other times (other than the hops <b>705</b>, <b>707</b>), the neighboring Base Stations <b>392</b>, <b>393</b>, <b>394</b>, <b>395</b>, <b>396</b> and <b>397</b> may transmit normally to other handsets (not shown) to which they are connected.</p>
    <p>As described hereinabove, the Base Station that is communicating with the handset sends the call parameters to neighboring Base Stations via the local area network (LAN <b>140</b>) that connects all of the Base Stations. It will also send information regarding the timing of hops that they may use to call handsets that it is communicating with. As described hereinabove with respect to FIG. 11, the neighboring Base Stations can synchronize the TOD. According to the timing of the hops received with high energy (P<sub>1</sub>), the Base Stations that wait for the call, can determine the times in which they are allowed to try to call the handset. In these times the Base Stations transmit to all handsets that are communicating with neighboring Base Stations.</p>
    <heading>Detecting Movement of a Handset</heading> <p>The two techniques for detecting a handset, described immediately hereinabove, are “passive” in the sense that they do not require any actions to be taken by the handset, other than the initial action of being engaged in a call (connected to a Base Station). The technique described immediately hereinbelow is “active” in the sense that it requires some further participation (albeit minimal) from the handset. However, such a mechanism is standard in most wireless communication protocols, even in those that were not originally meant to support mobility (handoff). In either case (“passive” or “active”), it is important to recognize that the present invention can work with standard handsets, without modification thereto.</p>
    <p>Although the handsets do not need to have a mechanism for supporting (actively participating in) handoff, they preferably have a mechanism that allows checking whether their communication links are operating normally. For example, in the Bluetooth short-range communication link, a “PING” command that is sent on the asynchronous link is used to check whether the data communication link is operative. When the handset receives a “PING” command it will automatically respond with an “ECHO” message (response). Since the “PING” command is sent on an asynchronous link, and not the synchronous link that is used for voice communication, in does not disrupt the voice quality, but only slightly (and temporarily) reduces the available bandwidth for data transfer.</p>
    <p>The “PING” command includes the following data fields:</p>
    <p>Device address</p>
    <p>Identifier</p>
    <p>Length</p>
    <p>Data (optional)</p>
    <p>The “ECHO” response includes the:</p>
    <p>Identifier</p>
    <p>Length</p>
    <p>Data (optional)</p>
    <p>In the Identifier, an identification of the originating Base Station is sent. Hence, when the handset replies it is possible for any Base Station receiving the “ECHO” reply to know which Base Station originated the reply.</p>
    <p>The “PING” command and “ECHO” response are used by a Base Station in order to determine whether a certain handset has entered its coverage area. Unlike the methods of passively detecting the handset presence, discussed hereinabove, this method allows detection of a Base Station that was not actively engaged in a call at the time of handoff. It is enough for the handset to have only created an initial communication with a Base Station.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 15A and 15B, illustrate the use of “PING” command and the “ECHO” response by the Base Station that is waiting for the call.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 15A, the handset <b>121</b> is currently communicating with the Base Station #1 <b>123</b> via communications link <b>122</b>. During this time, the Base Station #2 <b>124</b> that is waiting for the call will periodically send a “PING” command <b>145</b> to the handset <b>121</b>. When the handset <b>121</b> enters the coverage area (is in range) of the waiting Base Station <b>124</b>, and when it receives a “PING” command with its address, it will reply with an “ECHO” response <b>146</b>. The “ECHO” response <b>146</b> is also received by the Base Station #1 <b>123</b>.</p>
    <p>The waiting Base Station #2 <b>124</b> transmits the “PING” command <b>145</b> during the hops that the Base Station #1 <b>123</b> has dedicated (yielded) for this operation, as described hereinabove (see, e.g., FIG. 14B, <b>702</b>, <b>703</b>). The “ECHO” reply <b>146</b> will be received by both Base Stations <b>123</b> and <b>124</b>, whereupon the Base Stations <b>123</b> and <b>124</b> can each measure the quality of the received signal (“ECHO”) and report the measurements to the Switch (e.g., <b>129</b>; FIG. <b>2</b>). Based on this measurement of the quality of the received signal, the Switch <b>129</b> can compare signal quality and decide when is the right time to perform the handoff, and implement the handoff procedures described hereinabove.</p>
    <p>FIG. 15B illustrates an alternative, “active” method for detecting the handset <b>121</b>. In this example, The Base Station #1 <b>123</b> that is currently connected to the handset <b>121</b> transmits a “PING” command <b>147</b>, once in M hops. The handset <b>121</b> replies with an “ECHO” response <b>146</b>′ for each “PING” command <b>147</b> it receives. When the handset <b>121</b> enters the coverage area of neighboring Base Station #2 <b>124</b>, the neighboring Base Station #2 <b>124</b> will receive the “ECHO” response <b>146</b>′ by monitoring each Mth hop, in order to receive the “ECHO” response of the handset <b>121</b> that is approaching it. When the neighboring Base Station #2 <b>124</b> receives the “ECHO” response <b>146</b>′, it measures the quality of the received signal, and reports to the Switch <b>129</b>. This method is different from the method previously described with respect to FIG. 15A in two aspects:</p>
    <p>1) In the method of FIG. 15B, the Base Station <b>123</b> connected to the handset, does not skip each Mth hop, but rather transmits a “PING” to the handset</p>
    <p>2) In the method of FIG. 15B, the neighboring Base Stations (e.g., <b>124</b>) do not transmit “PING”s to the handset <b>121</b>—rather, they only passively monitor each Mth hop.</p>
    <p>The quality of each hop may be measured by many known methods, such as energy level measurement, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measurement, packet loss ratio and bit error rate measurement (BER) that can be performed on the header of each message.</p>
    <heading>Another Handset Detection Technique</heading> <p>Each Base Station maintains a “Neighbor Connections Table”, which includes information about the connections between handsets and neighboring Base Stations. The “Neighbor Connections Table”, includes the following information:</p>
    <p>Connection number</p>
    <p>Handset ID</p>
    <p>Base Station ID</p>
    <p>Handoff status: Idle/Started</p>
    <p>Handset detection status</p>
    <p>Number of successful “PING”</p>
    <p>Time of last successful “PING”</p>
    <p>Quality measurements in successful “PING”</p>
    <p>FIG. 16A illustrates a technique (procedure) for detecting a handset that enters the coverage area of a Base Station when (as in the example of FIG. 15B) the Base Station that the handset is currently connected to generates the “PING” command that is sent to the handsets. All of the Base Stations (e.g., <b>391</b>-<b>397</b>; FIG. 14A) preferably perform the same detection procedure, whether they the handset is connected with them or not.</p>
    <p>When a hop is due (steps <b>400</b>, <b>401</b>), the even-numbered hops are used by the handset, and the Base Stations use the odd-numbered hops. In a step <b>402</b>, a hop counter is incremented by one, and if (as determined in the step <b>403</b>) it is the Kth hop, the Base Station will to try to send a “PING” to one of the handsets that are candidates for handoff. If it is not the Kth hop (step <b>403</b>, “N”), the Base Station waits for the next hop (step <b>400</b>).</p>
    <p>As used herein, “NMAC” represents the address of the handset that will be called, and “NegTab” is an abbreviation of “Neighboring Connection Table”.</p>
    <p>If handoff has not started yet with any handset (step <b>404</b>, “N”), all the handsets will be called in order. The pointer to the NegTab is incremented (step <b>405</b>), and the address of the handset is retrieved from the NegTab (step <b>406</b>). The Base Station then transmits a “PING” command with the address of the handset (step <b>407</b>). When handoff has already started with one or more than one handsets, these handsets are “PING”ed more often than the others. The next item in the NegTab is checked (step <b>411</b>) and, if handoff with it has already started, it will be “PINGED” (steps <b>412</b>, <b>407</b>). The handsets that have not started handoff, will be “PING”ed only once in K<b>2</b> “PING”s (steps <b>410</b>, <b>413</b>, <b>414</b>).</p>
    <p>When an “ECHO” is received (step <b>420</b>, “Y”) and it is determined to be from a handset that communicates with a neighboring Base Station (step <b>419</b>, “N”), it will be compared to all the entries in the “Neighbor Connections Table” (NegTab) <b>421</b>,<b>422</b>. If it is found in the NegTab (step <b>422</b>, “Y”), the quality of the hop is measured (step <b>423</b>) and a record of the average quality in the previous hops is maintained in the “Neighbor Connections Table” (step <b>424</b>). The following measurement parameters are sent to the Switch (step <b>425</b>):</p>
    <p>Base Station communicating with handset</p>
    <p>Base Station originating “PING”</p>
    <p>Base Station receiving “PING”</p>
    <p>Identification of handset</p>
    <p>Quality of received signal</p>
    <p>FIG. 16B illustrates a procedure that a Base Station performs when it receives an “ECHO” response from one of the handsets that are connected to it (from FIG. 16A, step <b>419</b>, “Y”). The “ECHO” response can be received either when the connected Base Station or one of its neighbors sends a “PING” message to the handset. (See, e.g., FIGS. 15A and 15B.) First, the Base Station checks to see if the “ECHO” reply was caused by itself, or by one of the neighboring Base Stations (steps <b>430</b>, <b>431</b>). This information is contained in the Identifier of the “ECHO” reply, as described hereinabove.</p>
    <p>If the “ECHO” was caused by a neighboring Base Station (step <b>431</b>, “Y”), the quality of the received signal is measured and averaged (step <b>432</b>), and the measurement parameters are sent the Switch (step <b>433</b>) to be used by the Switch in determining when to perform handoff. If the Base Station itself caused the “ECHO” reply (step <b>431</b>, “N”), the task simply exits (“B”).</p>
    <p>FIGS. 16A and 16B illustrated the procedure of transmitting the “PING” from the Base Station that the handset is connected too, and detecting the arrival of a handset from a neighboring Base Station.</p>
    <p>FIG. 23 illustrates a procedure for performed by the Base Station when reception or transmission of a hop is required (steps <b>1200</b>, <b>1201</b>). Once in K hops (step <b>1202</b>), if the next time slot is for transmission (step <b>1203</b>), the Base Stations sends a “PING” to one of the handsets that are connected to it. Tcount is incremented (step <b>1204</b>), and the next handset that appears in the list of handsets (Connection Table, or “ConTab”) that are connected to the Base Station is chosen (step <b>1205</b>).</p>
    <p>The “PING” is sent with the address taken from the ConTab (step <b>1206</b>). When it is time to receive a hop, the receiver looks for an “ECHO” response (step <b>1207</b>). If an “ECHO” is received, and it originator was a neighboring Base Station (step <b>1208</b>), the parameters are compared to the NegTab (step <b>1209</b>), and if it is found in the table (step <b>1214</b>), the quality of the signal is measured (step <b>1210</b>) and averaged (step <b>1211</b>). If the “ECHO” response was to a “PING” command that originated from the same Base Station, the quality is measured (step <b>1213</b>). In both cases the connection parameters and the quality are sent to the Switch (step <b>1212</b>).</p>
    <p>When an “ECHO” response is received (FIG. 16A, step <b>425</b>; or FIG. 16B, step <b>433</b>; or FIG. 23, step <b>1212</b>), the following data is sent to the Switch:</p>
    <p>Received quality</p>
    <p>If from handset from neighbor Base Station, the average quality of the received “PINGS”</p>
    <p>If from handset connected to same Base Station, the received quality that is monitored continuously, and also the average quality of the received “PINGS”</p>
    <p>Base Station originating “PING”</p>
    <p>Base Station receiving “ECHO”</p>
    <p>Base Station currently connected to handset</p>
    <p>Measurement TOD</p>
    <heading>Performing Handoff</heading> <p>Two methods for detecting that a handset moves from one Base Station to another have been described hereinabove. The first handset detection method (FIGS. 13, <b>14</b>A, <b>14</b>B, <b>14</b>C, <b>14</b>D) is based on passive monitoring of the handset. In the second handset detection method (FIGS. 15A, <b>15</b>B, <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B) the handsets are actively “PING”ed, and their “ECHO” responses are noted. Using either one of these two methods, a Base Station that is connected to a handset continuously sends received quality measurements to the Switch and, when a neighboring Base Station detects a handset, a quality measurement is also sent by the neighboring Base Station to the Switch. A Base Station receiving an “ECHO” from one of the handsets that are connected to it (e.g., FIG. <b>15</b>B), also sends the quality measurement to the Switch. The decision as to when to perform handoff, between one Base Station and another, is made at the Switch, which uses these signal quality measurements from the Base Stations to determine the time for and destination of a handoff. FIG. 17A illustrates a method for making the handoff decision, when a passive detection method is used. FIG. 17B illustrates a method for making the handoff decision, when an active detection method is used.</p>
    <p>FIG. 17A illustrates a procedure that is implemented at the Switch (<b>129</b>) in order to decide to which Base Station the handset should be handed. Energy measurements from two or more (three shown) Base Stations <b>801</b>, <b>802</b> and <b>803</b> receiving a signal (i.e., the same signal) from a single handset (i.e., the same handset, not shown) are provided to the Switch, as described hereinabove (e.g., over the LAN <b>140</b>). At the Switch, these measurements are “smoothed” by a plurality (three shown) of sliding window averaging filters <b>804</b>, <b>805</b> and <b>806</b>, respectively, and they are compared with one another by decision (handoff control) logic <b>807</b>, which issues a signal (“Select Base Station”) to effect handoff. The sliding widow average filters <b>804</b>, <b>805</b> and <b>806</b> compute the average quality received from a given Base Station over the previous T<sub>r </sub>milliseconds, typically hundreds of milliseconds, (over a time interval encompassing at least two subsequent signals from the receiving Base Station), taking into account only the times in which the handset signal was received by more than one Base Station.</p>
    <p>The following pseudo-code describes a preferred operation of the decision logic <b>807</b>:</p>
    <p>The inputs to the decision logic are marked by X<sub>l </sub>. . . X<sub>k</sub>.</p>
    <p>The current Base Station communicating with the handset is Base Station ‘m’</p>
    <p>(1) If maximum (X<sub>l</sub>, . . . ,X<sub>k</sub>)=X<sub>j </sub> </p>
    <p>(2) If X<sub>j</sub>&gt;X<sub>m</sub>+D<sub>1 </sub> </p>
    <p>(3) If time from previous handoff&gt;T<sub>d </sub> </p>
    <p>(4) Transfer call to Base Station j</p>
    <p>(5) If X<sub>j</sub>&gt;X<sub>m</sub>+D<sub>2 </sub> </p>
    <p>(6) Transfer call to Base Station j</p>
    <p>If a Base Station receives the handset at a level which is stronger by at least D<sub>1 </sub>decibels than the level which is currently received by the Base Station with which the handset currently communicates, and at least T<sub>d </sub>milliseconds have passed from the last handoff, a handoff is required. This is intended to address the situation of a moderate and slow movement of a handset from one Base Station to another.</p>
    <p>If a Base Station receives the handset at a level, which is stronger by at least D<sub>2 </sub>decibels than the level, which is currently received by the Base Station with which the handset currently communicates a handoff will be performed immediately. This is intended to address the situation of an abrupt move from one Base Station to another.</p>
    <p>When the Base Stations use one of the active methods to detect handset presence, the decision algorithm is basically the same as has just been described. The main difference comes from the fact that in the active method the different Base Stations are able to determine the quality that they measured for a single hop, which all of them can identify. Therefore, the Switch is able to compute the quality difference per hop, and thus improve the timing accuracy of handoff.</p>
    <p>FIG. 17B illustrates the handoff decision method when using an active detection method. According to the TOD indication that is received along with the quality measurements, the measurements of the same hops are aligned in time (<b>808</b>). They are then averaged over X hops (<b>804</b>, <b>805</b>, <b>806</b>), and the same decision logic (<b>807</b>) that was described above may be used to determine which is the most suitable Base Station to connect to the handset, and issue the “select Base Station” signal.</p>
    <p>The methods described hereinabove relate to performing handoff between Base Stations when the handset is conducting a call. When a handset is not conducting a call it may move from one Base Station to the other. When it moves, one connection will be ended, and another will be created. The mechanism for ending a connection, and initiating a new one is part of the short-range wireless communication protocol. For example in the Bluetooth protocol, the handset searches for a Base Station, when it finds one, it stays connected to it. If it leaves the coverage area of the Base Station, the connection will end, and the handset will search again for a Base Station. This mechanism is sufficient for a handset that is not currently in a call, but it does not guarantee smooth handoff while in a call. Although this method may be suitable in some conditions, disconnecting from one Base Station and re-establishing connection with the other may take several seconds, and during this time it will not be possible to initiate a call. One of the advantages of the method of actively “PING”ing a handset is that its movement can be detected quickly, even when it is not engaged in a call, and this “waiting” period can be eliminated.</p>

    <p>If a handoff is required:</p>
    <p>Send handoff commands to the originating Base Station and the Base Station receiving the handset.</p>
    <p>Update “Connections Table”</p>
    <p>When there is more than one Switch in the system (see, e.g., FIG. 22) the Switch procedures will be slightly different, as follows:</p>
    <p>1) Receive new connection information</p>
    <p>Create instance of high-level protocol</p>
    <p>Update “Connections Table”</p>
    <p>Send new connection information to all the Switches.</p>

    <p>If handoff</p>
    <p>Update “Connections Table”</p>
    <p>Update “Calls Table”</p>
    <p>The Switch also keeps a LOG file of the events in the system. The LOG file includes the quality measurements, call parameters (time, caller ID, called ID, reason for termination, etc.) and the handoff decisions. These may serve to analyze the Base Station's topology and allow for topology improvements and adjustments. For example the reason for a call termination may be correlated to low receive quality, which could imply that there is a “hole” in the coverage pattern.</p>
    <heading>Detection and Time Synchronization</heading> <p>FIG. 20 illustrates the implementation of detection and time synchronization method that is based on a correlator. As described hereinabove, the correlator/detector (<b>308</b>) was the basis for synchronization of TOD in FIG. 11, and for the detection of presence of a transmitter and synchronization in FIG. <b>13</b>.</p>
    <p>It is important for a neighboring Base Station to be able to detect and synchronize with a mobile unit prior to receiving a handoff. This process should be done as quickly as possible to ensure seamless handoff of a session. Generally, the process begins with a wide-range search for “target” signals having the correct timing for a mobile unit, based on the rough synchronization information provided by the Base Station which is connected with the mobile unit. These “target” signals are estimated, based on the rough synchronization data. When a match is found (an actual signal from mobile unit is acquired) the search range can be narrowed accordingly (and dramatically). Then, synchronization can proceed as described hereinabove.</p>
    <p>The detector/correlator <b>2000</b> comprises a signal detector <b>1001</b> and a correlator <b>1002</b>. The task of the detector/correlator <b>2000</b> is to provide information whether a target signal is currently received, and to estimate the parameters which serve the hand-off process. The signal detector <b>1001</b> and correlator <b>1002</b> receive the actual received signal <b>1008</b> and its corresponding time <b>1009</b> and frequency <b>1004</b>, as illustrated, and correlates them to the emulated time and frequency instances <b>1006</b>. The fine TOD, drift and quality of the target signal are estimated by the correlator <b>1002</b> which reports the estimated parameters <b>1007</b>, along with a status which indicates whether the target signal has been acquired, or not. The task of the signal detector <b>1001</b> is to process the received signal <b>1008</b> and to estimate its time of arrival (TOA), i.e. the exact timing of a hop, and quality values <b>1003</b>. This may be done by several techniques, which are well known from classical detection theory. As an example of such techniques, an energy detector and a matched filter can be used.</p>
    <p>FIG. 21 shows an example of the implementation of the signal detector <b>1001</b> of FIG. <b>20</b>. In FIG. 21, the received signal <b>1008</b>, which is received from the RF receiver output, is fed to an energy detector <b>1011</b>. The energy detector <b>1011</b> produces a signal <b>1014</b>, which represents the temporal energy shape of the signal. The temporal energy shape <b>1014</b> is fed into a matched filter <b>1012</b>. The matched filter <b>1012</b> has an impulse response, which matches the energy shape the target signal. As is known, per classical estimation and detection theory, the matched filter <b>1012</b> will produce maximum value at the time instance which represents an estimation of the time of arrival (TOA), i.e. exact timing of the hops, of the target signal <b>1008</b>. The maximum value of the filter output represents an estimation of the received signal quality. The time instance, which represents the estimation of the TOA, is represented in terms of the time clock <b>1009</b>. The matched filter <b>1012</b> reports TOA and quality values of which the quality is above a threshold value T<sub>h</sub>, and the maximum is a global maximum within a two-sided time window of T<sub>s1 </sub>microseconds. Other implementations of the signal detector <b>1001</b> in FIG. 20 can be utilized. Such implementations can correlate the received signal <b>1008</b> with the known portions of the target signal temporal pattern instead of its energy temporal shape. Such implementations may achieve improved estimation performance.</p>
    <p>The time-frequency correlator <b>1002</b> in FIG. 20 receives the TOA and quality values <b>1003</b> produced by the signal detector <b>1001</b> and corresponding frequency values <b>1004</b>, which are the actual tuning frequency of the RF receiver. These inputs are referred to herein as the ‘actual’ TOA-frequency-quality instances. These include the estimated information of the signals, which are received from the various sources. On the other inputs, the time/frequency correlator <b>1002</b> receives emulated values of TOA and frequency <b>1006</b> instances for a specific target source (i.e. a specific handset). We will refer to these values hereafter as ‘target’ TOA-frequency instances. The time-frequency correlator seeks matches in the instances from both sources—the ‘actual’ and the ‘target’ and detects TOA-frequency patterns at the ‘actual’ instances which are ‘similar’ to the ‘target’ pattern. This process is performed in two possible modes:</p>
    <p>1. ‘Acquisition’ mode in which a match of the ‘target’ to ‘actual’ patterns is searched over longer time shifts periods, which cover the uncertainty of the possible fine TOD.</p>
    <p>2. ‘Tracking’ mode in which the fine TOD and drift have been already estimated, and the match between of the ‘target’ to ‘actual’ is searched and verified on new TOA-frequency instances over a shorter uncertainty period.</p>
    <p>The ‘actual’ data <b>1003</b> and <b>1004</b> is written into ‘actual’ instances history buffer (e.g., FIFO) and constitutes a list of which records consists of ‘actual_TOA’, ‘actual frequency’ and ‘actual_quality’. The ‘target’ data <b>1006</b> is written into ‘target’ instances histories buffer (e.g., FIFO) and constitutes a list of which records consist of ‘target_TOA’ and ‘target_frequency’.</p>
    <p>In the ‘acquisition’ mode, at any given time, records from both lists of which TOA values are ‘younger’ than T<sub>y1 </sub>milliseconds (where T<sub>y1 </sub>is typically 10,000) in relation to current time clock (to be referred hereafter as ‘young’ records) are processed as follows:</p>
    <p>For each ‘target’ record, look for ‘actual’ records, which satisfy:</p>
    <p>Matching frequency value (i.e. ‘actual frequency’=‘target_frequency’).</p>
    <p>Absolute value of ‘TOA_diff’ (‘TOA_diff’=‘known_diff’—(‘actual_TOA’-‘target_TOA’)) is smaller than T<sub>y2 </sub>milliseconds (where T<sub>y2 </sub>is typically 500). Note: ‘known_diff’ is 0 in the acquisition mode.</p>
    <p>The ‘target’ and ‘actual’ records, which satisfy the conditions, are referred hereafter as ‘candidate_records’.</p>
    <p>For each of the ‘candidate_records’ write the corresponding ‘TOA_diff’, ‘actual_quality’ value and ‘actual_TOA’ value into a ‘candidates_list’.</p>
    <p>When all the ‘young_target’ records are processed against all ‘young_actual’ records, sort the ‘candidate_list’ by the ‘TOA_diff’ values and produce a ‘diff_histogram’ with resolution of T<sub>y3 </sub>microseconds (where T<sub>y3 </sub>is typically 1000) as follows:</p>
    <p>Scan the sorted ‘candidate_list’ records, identify the ‘TOA_diff’ values which are within the TOA diff range of each bin, and accumulate the corresponding ‘quality_values’ producing ‘diff_quality_histogram’ values per each bin.</p>
    <p>Search the ‘diff_quality_histogram’ for values, which are bigger than Ky (where Ky is typically 50). If found, set the status output <b>1007</b> value to ‘detected’, and identify the corresponding ‘actual_TOA’ and ‘TOA_diff’ values. The corresponding ‘actual_TOA’ and ‘actual_diff’ values are referred to hereinafter as a ‘diff_cluster’ of records. If no ‘diff_quality_histogram’ values exceed Ky, set the status output <b>1007</b> to ‘not_detected’.</p>
    <p>If status has been set to ‘detected’ perform a ‘least mean square error’ (LMSE) estimation of a linear line which mostly fits the two-dimensional ‘diff cluster’ instances (‘actual_TOA’ by ‘actual_diff’). LMSE estimation is a well-known estimation technique and is described in the classical literature.</p>
    <p>The estimated linear line can be represented as:</p>
    <p>diff='est diff0'+'est drift'*(TOA-TOA0) where TOA0 is the smallest ‘actual TOA’ value out of the ‘diff cluster’ records, ‘est diff0’ is the estimated output parameter of ‘fine TOD’ <b>1007</b> and ‘est drift is the estimation the output parameter ‘drift’ <b>1007</b>. The ‘diff quality histogram’ value normalized by the corresponding ‘bin population’ is the ‘quality’ output <b>1007</b> value.</p>
    <p>In the ‘tracking’ mode, at any given time, process the data in a similar way as in the ‘acquisition mode but with the following differences:</p>
    <p>The value of ‘known diff’ is set to ‘prev_est_diff0’+‘prev_est_drift’* (‘current_TOA0’-‘prev_TOA0’). The terms ‘prev_est<sub>—diff</sub>0’ and ‘prev_TOA0’ represented the ‘est_diff0’ and ‘TOA0’ which has been evaluated in the previous calculation (either in ‘acquisition’ mode or in ‘tracking’ mode). The term ‘current_TOA0’ is the ‘TOA0’ of current calculation.</p>
    <p>A smaller value of Ty<sub>4 </sub>microseconds (when Ty4 is typically 2000) for the ‘tracking’ mode replaces Ty<sub>2 </sub>of the ‘acquisition’ mode.</p>
    <heading>Base Station</heading> <p>FIG. 18 illustrates, in block diagram form, major components of a Base Station <b>1800</b>. A plurality (three shown) of front-end processors <b>604</b>, <b>605</b> and <b>606</b> are connected to a plurality (three shown) of antennas <b>601</b>, <b>602</b> and <b>603</b>, respectively. The front-end processors <b>604</b>, <b>605</b> and <b>606</b> perform the low-level protocols of the short-range communication protocol, described hereinabove.</p>
    <p>When idle, a front-end processor <b>604</b>, <b>605</b> and <b>606</b> waits for a handset to establish a new connection. When a connection is created it reports the call parameters (e.g., Bluetooth device address, TOD, Encryption key, authentication key, etc.) and transfers the call stream to the central processing unit <b>607</b>. When a front-end processor is idle, it can also be used to receive (detect, monitor) a handset that is leaving a neighboring Base Station. The central processing unit <b>607</b> then sends the front-end processor, the call parameters, and the exact time of handoff. The front-end processor, would at that time, continue the communicating with the handset, as if it was still in the neighboring Base Station.</p>
    <p>A separate circuit module <b>612</b> (TOD Synchronization &amp; Handset Detection) is used to detect arrival of new handset, and also to synchronize the TOD of all the calls, according to the techniques described hereinabove. This unit <b>612</b> is shown having its own antenna <b>611</b>.</p>
    <p>The central processing unit <b>607</b> controls the operation of the front-end processors <b>604</b>, <b>605</b> and <b>606</b>, receives data about new handoff and fine TOD estimation, receives data from neighboring Base Station, maintains the “Neighbor Connection Table”, communicates with the Switch and the other Base Stations. The local area network interface <b>609</b> is suitably a standard interface, for example a connection to a 10Base-T or 100-Base-T Ethernet, for connecting to the Local Area Network (LAN) <b>140</b>. Memory <b>608</b> and Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) <b>610</b> is shown connected to the central processing unit (CPU) <b>607</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 19 illustrates, in greater detail, an implementation of a representative one <b>604</b> of the front-end processors <b>604</b>, <b>605</b> and <b>606</b> described hereinabove with respect to FIG. 18. A base-band processor <b>631</b> determines the transmission and reception channels, encodes and decodes speech, deals with error correction, authentication and encryption. The radio frequency front end <b>630</b> modulates and demodulates the data, and connects to the antenna <b>601</b>. The base-band processor <b>631</b> controls the frequency (“frequency control” <b>633</b>) of each hop, sends and receives data (“energy, time of detection” <b>634</b>) from the RF front end, and receives indication of signal strength (“base band parameters” <b>635</b>).</p>
    <heading>Applications for the WPBX</heading> <p>Most of the preceding sections discussed the use of the methods disclosed in the current invention for a WPBX supporting telephony applications. Except for the methods shown in FIGS. 5, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>, most of the methods disclosed hereinabove are application independent, as follows:</p>
    <p>The method for dividing the short-range communication protocol in order to support mobility of devices. The high-level protocols, including telephony-related protocols, and also protocols for data transfer, such as PPP over the short-range communication link.</p>
    <p>The methods for synchronizing the Base Station.</p>
    <p>The methods for detecting movement of transmitter from one Base Station to another</p>
    <p>The methods for decide when to perform handoff and to what Base Station to hand the call.</p>
    <p>These methods can be implemented in order to connect mobile devices that are equipped with a short-range communication transmitter/receiver such as a Bluetooth chipset. Such devices may move from the coverage area of one Base Station to the coverage area of another, when the Switch and Base Stations handle the handoff of the connection from one Base Station to another. Typical application may be the connection of laptop computers equipped with a Bluetooth short-range communication link to the organization's e-mail server. Another possible application is connecting such mobile devices that for example utilize the PPP (point-to-point protocol) over Bluetooth wireless link, to the Internet, via a central remote access server. A system may also support several such applications.</p>
    <p>For example in FIG. 24, a personal data (or digital) assistant (PDA) <b>1301</b>, a laptop computer <b>1302</b> and a cellular handset <b>1303</b>, connect to the systems Base Stations <b>1304</b> and <b>1305</b>, as illustrated. The PDA <b>1301</b> and the laptop <b>1302</b> may connect, via the local area network (LAN) <b>1306</b> to an e-mail server <b>1308</b> in order to send or receive messages, and may also connect to a remote access server (RAS) <b>1309</b> for Internet connection. The cellular handset <b>1303</b> may connect to another handset (not shown) or, via a Telephony Gateway <b>1306</b> to the PSTN. The Base Stations <b>1304</b> and <b>1305</b> and the Switch <b>1307</b> handle the various levels of the communication protocol, utilizing the methods described hereinabove.</p>
    <p>It is within the scope of the invention that the mobile unit is a device which is any of the following devices: telephone handset, standard cordless telephone handset, cellular telephone handset, personal data device, personal digital assistant (PDA), computer, laptop computer, e-mail server, and a device utilizing point-to-point protocol (PPP) to the Internet via a central remote access server, a headset (including a cordless headset), a personal server, a wearable computer (or computing device), a wireless (video or still) camera, or a mobile music players (i.e., MP-3 devices etc).</p>
    <p>Although the invention has been described with respect to a limited number of embodiments, it will be appreciated that many variations, modifications and other applications of the invention may be made, and are intended to be within the scope of the invention, as disclosed herein.</p>
