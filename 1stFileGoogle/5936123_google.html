    <p>The present invention relates to new substituted 1-phenyl-3-pyrazolecarboxamides having a great affinity for human neurotensin receptors, to a process for preparing them and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them as active principles.</p>
    <p>The first synthetic non-peptide potential medicinal products capable of binding to neutotensin receptors have been described in EP-0,477,049. They are amides of 3-pyrazolecarboxylic acid, variously substituted with amino acids, which displace iodinated neurotensin from its receptor, at doses of less than one micromole, on guinea pig brain membranes. This series led to the development of a compound, 2- (1-(7-chloro-4-quinolyl)-5-(2,6-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-pyrazolyl)carbonylamino!-2-adamantanecarboxylic acid, SR 48692, endowed with potent and selective neurotensin-antagonist activity (D. Gully et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1993, 90, 65-69).</p>
    <p>The feature of the series of products described in EP-0,477,049 is the presence at position 1 of the pyrazole ring of, in particular, a phenyl, naphthyl or 4-quinolyl group, substituted or unsubstituted. More especially, SR 48692 possesses a 7-chloro-4-quinolyl group in position 1 of the pyrazole. The products described in this document having a 1-naphthyl or 4-chloro-1-naphthyl group in position 1 of the pyrazole ring have an extremely high affinity for the guinea pig neurotensin receptor, since their IC<sub>50</sub> is of the order of 1 to 10 nanomoles, whereas their affinity for the human receptor is lower since their IC<sub>50</sub> is from 10 to 100 nmol.</p>
    <p>It has now been found that, by substituting the phenyl group of 1-phenyl-3-pyrazolecarboxamide compounds with particular groups, the affinity for neurotensin receptors is increased, and more especially the affinity for human neurotensin receptors is increased.</p>
    <p>In addition, the compounds according to the present invention show in vivo a broader spectrum of activity than the compounds described in EP-0,477,049 as antagonists of the neurotensin receptors.</p>

    <p>or R'<sub>2x</sub> and R'<sub>3x</sub> together constitute a tetramethylene group;</p>
    <p>and their salts.</p>
    <p>Among the compounds of formula (Iy), a preferred group consists of the compounds of formula: ##STR52## in which R<sub>4y</sub>, R<sub>1x</sub> and NH--AA<sub>y</sub> (OH) are as defined above; preferably represents R'<sub>4y</sub>, R<sub>1p</sub> and NH--AA'<sub>y</sub> (OH) as defined for (Iy')</p>
    <p>their salts and their quaternary ammonium salts formed with acyclic or cyclic tertiary amines and their solvates.</p>
    <p>The compounds of the following formula are chosen more especially: ##STR53## in which: R<sub>1x</sub>, R<sub>2x</sub> and R<sub>3x</sub> are as defined above for (Ix) preferably R'<sub>1x</sub>, R'<sub>2x</sub> and R'<sub>3x</sub> as defined above for (Ix'), R'<sub>1x</sub> preferably being at the para position;</p>
    <p>their salts and their quaternary ammonium salts formed with acyclic or cyclic tertiary amines and their solvates.</p>
    <p>Preferentially, the invention relates to 2- 5-(2,6-dimethoxyphenyl)-1- 4- N-methyl-N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbamoyl!-2-isopropylphenyl!-3-pyrazolylcarbonylamino!-2-adamantanecarboxylic acid, its internal salt and its salts which are preferably pharmaceutically acceptable, and its solvates.</p>
    <p>According to another of its aspects, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of the substituted 1-phenyl-3-pyrazolecarboxamides of formula (I) and their salts, characterized in that:</p>
    <p>1) a functional derivative of a 1-phenyl-3-pyrazolecarboxylic acid of formula: ##STR54## in which R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub> and R<sub>4</sub> have the meanings given above for the compound of formula (I) and R'<sub>1</sub> represents a precursor of R<sub>1</sub> chosen from nitro, amino, phthalimido, halo, hydroxyl, sulpho, hydroxy(C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>7</sub>)alkylene, cyano, carboxyl, (C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>4</sub>)alkoxycarbonyl and benzyloxycarbonyl groups, is treated with an amino acid, optionally protected by protective groups which are customary in peptide synthesis, of formula:</p>
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation">H--HN--AA(OH)                                              (III)</pre>
    
    <p>in which --NH--AA(OH) is as defined above for the compound of formula (I);</p>
    <p>2) where appropriate, the functional acid derivative thereby obtained, of formula: ##STR55##  is subjected to a subsequent treatment suitable for converting the substituent R'<sub>1</sub>, a precursor of R<sub>1</sub>, to the substituent R<sub>1</sub> ;</p>
    <p>3) if necessary, the compound thereby obtained in step 1) or in step 2) is deprotected to yield the corresponding free acid of formula (I);</p>
    <p>4) where appropriate, a salt of the compound (I) thereby obtained or its quaternary ammonium salt is prepared.</p>
    <p>As a functional derivative of the substituted 1-phenyl-3-pyrazolecarboxylic acid of formula (II) or (II'), it is possible to use the acid chloride, the anhydride, a mixed anhydride, a C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>4</sub> alkyl ester, an activated ester, for example the p-nitrophenyl ester, or the free acid appropriately activated, for example with N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or with benzotriazol-1-yloxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP).</p>
    <p>The amino acids of formula (III) may be used either as they are, or after prior protection of the carboxyl group with protective groups which are customary in peptide synthesis, as described, for example, in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, Ed. J. F. W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973, page 183, or in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, II Ed. J. F. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991, page 224.</p>
    <p>For this protection, the carboxyl group of the amino acid (III) may be quite simply esterified, for example in the form of the methyl, benzyl or tert-butyl ester, the esterifying group then being removed by acid or basic hydrolysis or by hydrogenolysis. Protection by esterification can be used only when the group R<sub>1</sub> or R'<sub>1</sub> does not contain, for its part also, either an ester group which must be preserved, as in the case where, for example, R<sub>1</sub> might represent a group O--Y--COOR<sub>7</sub> or --Y--COOR<sub>7</sub> or --T--CONR<sub>7</sub> CHR<sub>20</sub> COOR<sub>7</sub> or --T--CONR<sub>7</sub> (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub> CH(NH<sub>2</sub>)CO<sub>2</sub> R<sub>7</sub> with R<sub>7</sub> =alkyl, or, in any case, a group liable to be affected during the unblocking of the ester group. Protection of the carboxyl group of the amino acid (III) may also be performed by silylation, for example with bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide, it being possible for the said protection to be performed in situ. The silyl ester of the compound (I) is then readily removed during the isolation of the final product by simple acidification, hydrolysis or exchange with an alcohol.</p>
    <p>Thus, in step 1) of the process, the chloride of a 1-phenyl-3-pyrazolecarboxylic acid, obtained by reacting thionyl chloride with an acid of formula (II) or (II'), may be reacted with an amino acid of formula (III), in a solvent such as acetonitrile, THF, DMF or DCM, under an inert atmosphere, at room temperature, for a time between a few hours and a few days, in the presence of a base such as pyridine, sodium hydroxide or triethylamine.</p>
    <p>A variant of step 1) consists in preparing the acid chloride or the mixed anhydride of a 1-phenyl-3-pyrazolecarboxylic acid by reacting isobutyl or ethyl chloroformate with an acid of formula (II) or (II'), in the presence of a base such as triethylamine, and in reacting it with an N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl) derivative of an amino acid of formula (III), obtained by reacting bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide or 1,3-bis(trimethylsilyl)urea or bis(trifluoromethylsilyl)acetamide with an amino acid of formula (III), in solvents such as acetonitrile and DCM, under an inert atmosphere, and for a time between 1 hour and a few days, at a temperature between room temperature and the refluxing temperature of the solvent.</p>
    <p>Another variant to the procedure of step 1) consists in reacting the mixed anhydride of a 1-phenyl-3-pyrazolecarboxylic acid of formula (II) or (II') with an amino acid of formula (III), in a solvent such as DCM, under an inert atmosphere, at room temperature, for a time between 1 day and a few days, in the presence of a base such as triethylamine.</p>
    <p>When the compound of formula (I) possesses a basic function and is obtained in the form of a free base, salification is performed by treatment with the chosen acid in an organic or aqueous solvent. By treatment of the free base, dissolved, for example, in an alcohol such as isopropanol, with a solution of the chosen acid in the same solvent, the corresponding salt is obtained, which salt is isolated according to standard techniques. Thus, for example, the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulphate, hydrogen sulphate, dihydrogen phosphate, methanesulphonate, methyl sulphate, oxalate, maleate, fumarate or 2-naphthalenesulphonate is prepared.</p>
    <p>When the compound of formula (I) possesses a basic function and is isolated in the form of one of its salts, for example the hydrochloride or oxalate, the free base may be prepared by neutralization of the said salt with an inorganic or organic base such as sodium hydroxide or triethylamine, or with an alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate such as sodium or potassium carbonate or bicarbonate.</p>
    <p>When the product of formula (I) is obtained in acid form, it may be converted to a metal salt, in particular an alkali metal salt such as the sodium salt or an alkaline-earth metal salt such as the calcium salt, according to standard processes.</p>
    <p>The compounds of formula (I) or (I') can undergo a dehydration in the presence of an anhydride, for example acetic anhydride, to form an oxazolone derivative of formula: ##STR56## in which R<sub>1</sub>, R'<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>, R<sub>4</sub>, X<sub>a</sub> and X'<sub>a</sub> have the meanings given above for (I) and R'<sub>1</sub> represents a precursor of R<sub>1</sub> as defined above.</p>
    <p>These compounds are new and constitute a further aspect of the invention.</p>
    <p>Among the compounds of formula (Ic) and (I'c), preference is given to those for which X<sub>a</sub> and X'<sub>a</sub>, together with the carbon atom to which they are attached, constitute an adamantane ring system or a bicyclo 3.3.1!nonane, or alternatively X<sub>a</sub> is hydrogen and X'<sub>a</sub> represents a cyclohexane.</p>
    <p>From a compound of formula (I'c) or (Ic), a compound of formula (I) or (I') is prepared again by hydrolysis in an acid medium or in a basic medium, for example in the presence of an alkali metal salt such as potassium tert-butylate.</p>
    <p>The intermediate preparation of a compound of formula (Ic) may be useful to permit the purification of a compound of formula (I). Moreover, the intermediate preparation of a compound of formula (I'c) may be useful to permit the conversion of a substituent R'<sub>1</sub> to another substituent R'<sub>1</sub> or R<sub>1</sub>, the acid function of the group NHAA(OH) being protected in the oxazolone group.</p>
    <p>The substituted 1-phenyl-3-pyrazolecarboxylic acids of the formula: ##STR57## in which R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub> and R<sub>4</sub> have the definitions given above for the compounds (I) and R'<sub>1</sub> represents a precursor of R<sub>1</sub> chosen from halo, nitro, amino, phthalimido, hydroxyl, hydroxy(C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>7</sub>)alkylene, sulpho, cyano, carboxyl, (C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>4</sub>)alkoxycarbonyl and benzyloxycarbonyl groups, as well as their functional derivatives of the acid function, are key intermediates in the preparation of the compounds of formula (I). When R'<sub>1</sub> is other than carboxyl or halo, the compounds of formula (II) and (II') are new, and they constitute a further aspect of the present invention.</p>
    <p>The acids of formulae (II) and (II'), the chlorides of the acids of formulae (II) and (II'), the C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>4</sub> alkyl esters of the acids of formulae (II) and (II'), which can also be precursors of the said acids (in particular the methyl, ethyl and tert-butyl esters), and the mixed anhydride of the acids of formulae (II) and (II') with isobutyl or ethyl chloroformate are especially preferred intermediate products.</p>
    <p>The process for preparing the compounds (II) or (II') via the esters (IIa) or (II'a) is represented by the following scheme: ##STR58## M:Na, K Alk:Me, Et</p>
    <p>Alk':(C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>4</sub>)alkyl</p>
    <p>In the first step a), a strong base such as a metal alcoholate is reacted with a ketone of formula 1 in which R<sub>4</sub> is as defined above, and then (step b) an equimolar amount of ethyl oxalate in an alkanol such as, for example, methanol or ethanol is reacted according to L. Claisen, Ber., 1909, 42, 59. After precipitation in an ether such as ethyl ether or isopropyl ether, the enolates 2 are separated by filtration. It is also possible to prepare a lithium enolate according to W. V. Murray et al., J. Heterocyclic Chem., 1989, 26, 1389.</p>
    <p>The metal enolate 2 thereby prepared and an excess of phenylhydrazine derivative 3, or of a salt of the latter, are then heated to reflux of acetic acid (step c) to obtain the esters IIa or II'a.</p>
    <p>On saponification of the esters IIa or II'a by the action of an alkaline agent such as, for example, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide or lithium hydroxide, followed by acidification, the acids II or II' are obtained (step d).</p>
    <p>Among the compounds of formula 3, some are new and constitute a further subject of the present invention.</p>
    <p>Thus, the compounds of formula: ##STR59## in which: R'<sub>2</sub> and R'<sub>3</sub> each independently represent a hydrogen, a (C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>6</sub>)alkyl, a (C<sub>3</sub> -C<sub>8</sub>)cycloalkyl, a (C<sub>3</sub> -C<sub>8</sub>)cycloalkylmethyl;</p>
    <p>or R'<sub>2</sub> and R'<sub>3</sub> together constitute a trimethylene, tetramethylene or pentamethylene group;</p>
    <p>R<sub>y</sub> is at position 4 or at position 5 and represents a group chosen from: cyano, carboxyl, (C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>4</sub>)alkoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, sulpho, (C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>4</sub>)alkylsulphonylamino, (C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>4</sub>)alkylphenylsulphonylamino, carbamoyl, (C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>4</sub>)alkylcarboxamido;</p>
    <p>on condition that R'<sub>2</sub> and R'<sub>3</sub> do not simultaneously represent hydrogen and on condition that R'<sub>2</sub> is other than methyl when R<sub>y</sub> is a sulpho group;</p>
    <p>and their salts, are new and constitute a further subject of the present invention.</p>
    <p>The phenylhydrazine derivatives (3) may be prepared according to Houben-Weyl, 1967, X-2, 169. For example, it is possible to carry out diazotization of the corresponding phenylamine in the presence of sodium nitrite, followed by reduction of the diazonium salt, for example by the action of stannous chloride. When the phenyl contains an electron-attracting substituent such as cyano or nitro, a fluorophenyl derivative may also be substituted with hydrazine hydrate to obtain the corresponding hydrazinophenyl derivative. The substituted phenylamines are known or prepared by known methods. For example, the aminosulphonic acids are prepared according to Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie. Verlag, 1955, vol. IX, 450.</p>
    <p>The phenylhydrazine derivatives substituted with a group R<sub>1</sub> =YCO<sub>2</sub> R<sub>7</sub> are prepared from corresponding aniline or nitrophenyl derivatives.</p>
    <p>The conversion of a compound of formula I' or respectively of formula II' or of formula II'a in which the phenyl group is substituted with R'<sub>1</sub> to a compound of formula I or respectively of formula II or of formula IIa in which the phenyl group is substituted with R<sub>1</sub> is performed by standard methods well known to a person skilled in the art.</p>
    <p>The compounds of formula IIa or II'a in which R<sub>1</sub> or R'<sub>1</sub> represents a carboxyl or carboxy(C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>7</sub>)alkylene group enable compounds of formula IIa in which R<sub>1</sub> represents a group --TCONR<sub>a</sub> R<sub>b</sub> to be prepared, with an amine HNR<sub>a</sub> R<sub>b</sub>, by reaction of the acid chloride prepared in an intermediate step, or of any other activated derivative of the acid such as the mixed anhydrides, activated esters or derivatives obtained with 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.</p>
    <p>In the same way, the compounds of formula I' in which R'<sub>1</sub> represents a group --TCOOH enable the compounds of formula I in which R<sub>1</sub> represents a group --TCONR<sub>a</sub> R<sub>b</sub> to be prepared; the carboxylic acid function of the amino acid residue NHAA(OH) must then be protected in an intermediate step, for example by an ester group such as tert-butyl ester or by formation of the oxazolone derivative of formula (Ic).</p>
    <p>From a compound of formula I or respectively Ic, or respectively from an ester of formula IIa, or respectively from an alkali metal salt of an acid of formula II, in which compounds the substituent R<sub>1</sub> is a group TCONH(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>s</sub> CR<sub>7</sub> R<sub>8</sub> (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>t</sub> NR<sub>5</sub> R<sub>6</sub>, a compound of formula I or respectively of formula Ic or respectively of formula IIa, or respectively an alkali metal salt of acid of formula II, in which compounds the substituent R<sub>1</sub> is a group TCONR<sub>9</sub> (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>s</sub> CR<sub>7</sub> R<sub>8</sub> (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>t</sub> NR<sub>5</sub> R<sub>6</sub>, may be prepared by the action of an iodide of formula R<sub>9</sub> I.</p>
    <p>The compounds of formula IIa or respectively II or respectively Ic in which R<sub>1</sub> represents a carboxy(C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>7</sub>)alkylene group enable the compounds of formula IIa or respectively II or respectively I in which R<sub>1</sub> represents a group --TCONR<sub>7</sub> R<sub>c</sub> to be prepared by reacting the acid chloride prepared in an intermediate step with a compound NHR<sub>7</sub> R<sub>c</sub>, that is to say with a compound of formula NHR<sub>7</sub> XOR<sub>7</sub> or a compound of formula HNR<sub>7</sub> CHR<sub>20</sub> CO<sub>2</sub> R<sub>7</sub> or a compound of formula HNR<sub>7</sub> (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub> CH(NHPro)CO<sub>2</sub> R<sub>7</sub> in which Pro represents a protecting group of the amine function used traditionally in peptide chemistry, for example tert-butoxycarbonyl or benzyloxycarbonyl.</p>
    <p>By reacting the compounds of formula I in which R<sub>1</sub> represents a --CH<sub>2</sub> CONH<sub>2</sub> group with sodium peroxide, the compounds of formula I in which R<sub>1</sub> represents a carboxymethyl group are obtained. By reducing the compounds of formula I in which R<sub>1</sub> represents a --CH<sub>2</sub> CN group, for example by hydrogenation in the presence of a catalyst such as Raney® nickel, the compounds of formula I in which R<sub>1</sub> represents a --CH<sub>2</sub> CH<sub>2</sub> NH<sub>2</sub> group are obtained. The latter compounds enable compounds of formula I in which R<sub>1</sub> represents a group --CH<sub>2</sub> CH<sub>2</sub> NR<sub>5</sub> R<sub>6</sub>, a group --CH<sub>2</sub> CH<sub>2</sub> N(R<sub>7</sub>)COR<sub>e</sub> or a group --CH<sub>2</sub> CH<sub>2</sub> N(R<sub>7</sub>)SO<sub>2</sub> R'<sub>7</sub> to be prepared by methods known to a person skilled in the art.</p>
    <p>Similarly, the compounds of formula (I) in which R<sub>1</sub> represents a group --T'--CN, T' being a direct bond or a (C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>6</sub>)alkylene, enable compounds of formula I to be prepared in which R<sub>1</sub> represents a group --T'--CH<sub>2</sub> NH<sub>2</sub>, and then compounds of formula I in which R<sub>1</sub> is a group --T'--CH<sub>2</sub> NR<sub>5</sub> R<sub>6</sub>, a group --T'--CH<sub>2</sub> N(R<sub>7</sub>)COR<sub>e</sub> or a group --T'--CH<sub>2</sub> N(R<sub>7</sub>)SO<sub>2</sub> R'<sub>7</sub>.</p>
    <p>The catalytic reduction may be carried out according to Catalytic Hydrogenation, R. L. Augustine--Marcel Dekker, 1967, 96-97; it may be applied to the compounds of formula I in which R<sub>2</sub> and R<sub>3</sub> are other than a nitro or a cyano and R<sub>4</sub> is other than a (C<sub>3</sub> -C<sub>4</sub>)alkenyl. The substitution of the amino group may be performed by different processes described, for example, in Catalytic Hydrogenation, R. L. Augustine--M. Dekker, 1965, 102-113, and Catalytic Hydrogenation over Platinum Metals, P. N. Rylander--Academic Press, 1967, 291. Thus, for example, the addition of an aldehyde of formula R<sub>V</sub> CHO to an amino group yields an imine group which, on catalytic hydrogenation, is converted to secondary amine --NHCH<sub>2</sub> R<sub>V</sub> in which R<sub>V</sub> represents a hydrogen or a (C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>3</sub>)alkyl. The addition of a ketone of formula RCOR' yields an amine --NHCHRR' in which --CHRR' represents a group R<sub>5</sub>, and R<sub>6</sub> is hydrogen. The addition of a (C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>4</sub>)alkyl halide also enables an amino group substituted with one or two (C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>4</sub>)alkyls to be prepared. The addition of a suitable dihalide enables compounds to be prepared in which R<sub>5</sub> and R<sub>6</sub>, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, constitute a heterocycle chosen from pyrrolidine, piperidine, morpholine, thiomorpholine and piperazine substituted at position 4 with R<sub>9</sub>, aziridine, azetidine and perhydroazepine.</p>
    <p>The compounds of formula IIa in which R<sub>1</sub> represents a group T--NHSO<sub>2</sub> R'<sub>7</sub> enable compounds of formula II'a in which R<sub>1</sub> represents a group T--N(XNR<sub>5</sub> R<sub>6</sub>)SO<sub>2</sub> R'<sub>7</sub> to be prepared by the action of a halide of formula HalXNR<sub>5</sub> R<sub>6</sub>. In an acid medium, compounds of formula II in which R<sub>1</sub> is a group TNHXNR<sub>5</sub> R<sub>6</sub> which represents TNHR<sub>28</sub>, may then be prepared. To obtain the compounds of formula I in which R<sub>1</sub> represents a group TNR<sub>27</sub> R<sub>28</sub>, substitution of the nitrogen is performed by known methods, either on a compound of formula II or on a compound of formula I.</p>
    <p>The compounds of formula II'a, or respectively the compounds of formula III or the compounds of formula I', in which R'<sub>1</sub> represents a nitro group may be converted to compounds of formula II'a, or respectively of formula II' or of formula I', in which R'<sub>1</sub> is an amino group; then, by known methods, the compounds of formula IIa, or respectively of formula II or of formula I, in which R<sub>1</sub> represents a group --N(R<sub>7</sub>)COR<sub>e</sub> or NR<sub>5</sub> R<sub>6</sub> are prepared.</p>
    <p>The compounds of formula II'a, or respectively of formula II' or of formula I', in which R'<sub>1</sub> is an amino group also enable compounds of formula II'a, or respectively of formula II' or of formula I', in which R'<sub>1</sub> represents a hydroxyl group to be prepared; then, by known methods, the compounds of formula IIa, or respectively of formula II or of formula I, in which R<sub>1</sub> represents a group --OR<sub>d</sub> are prepared.</p>
    <p>From the compounds of formula II'a in which R'<sub>1</sub> is a group --Y--OH, compounds of formula II'a in which R'<sub>1</sub> is a group --Y--Cl may be prepared by the action of hydrochloric acid or thionyl chloride; by the action of a sulphonic acid derivative on these same compounds bearing the substituent --Y--OH, compounds of the formula II'a in which R'<sub>1</sub> is the group --Y--OSO<sub>2</sub> W, W representing a methyl, a trifluoromethyl or a tolyl, may be prepared. The action of an amine NHR<sub>5</sub> R<sub>6</sub> on compounds of formula II'a substituted with a group --Y--Cl or a group --Y--O--SO<sub>2</sub> W enables compounds of formula IIa in which R<sub>1</sub> represents a group --Y--NR<sub>5</sub> R<sub>6</sub> to be prepared.</p>
    <p>When R<sub>2</sub> represents a nitro or cyano and R<sub>3</sub> represents hydrogen, the action of a compound R<sub>d</sub> OH in a basic medium on a compound of formula II'a, or respectively of formula II' or respectively of formula I', in which R'<sub>1</sub> is a halogen at the ortho or para position with respect to R<sub>2</sub> enables compounds of formula IIa, or respectively of formula II or respectively of formula I, in which R<sub>1</sub> is a group --OR<sub>d</sub> to be prepared.</p>
    <p>When R<sub>2</sub> and R<sub>3</sub> are other than a halogen atom, a compound of formula IIa, or respectively of formula II or respectively of formula I, in which R<sub>1</sub> is a cyano may also be prepared from a compound of formula II'a, or respectively of formula II' or respectively of formula I', in which R'<sub>1</sub> is a halogen, by the action of a cyanide derivative, for example the cuprous cyanide.</p>
    <p>The compounds of formula I in which R<sub>1</sub> is a cyano group enable the compounds of formula I in which R<sub>1</sub> is a carbamoyl group to be prepared by reaction with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide. In the same way, the compounds of formula II in which R<sub>1</sub> is a carbamoyl group are prepared from the compounds of formula IIa in which R<sub>1</sub> is a cyano group.</p>
    <p>The compounds of formula I in which R<sub>1</sub> is a cyano group also enable the compounds of formula I in which R<sub>1</sub> represents a --C(NH<sub>2</sub>)═NOH group or a group --C(NH<sub>2</sub>)═NO(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>r</sub> NR<sub>5</sub> R<sub>6</sub> to be prepared by reaction with hydroxylamine, where appropriate O-substituted with --(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>q</sub> NR<sub>5</sub> R<sub>6</sub>, in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate.</p>
    <p>From the compounds of formula IIa, or respectively of formula II or respectively of formula I, in which R<sub>1</sub> represents a C(NH<sub>2</sub>)═NOH group, the compounds of formula IIa, or respectively of formula II or respectively of formula I, in which R<sub>1</sub> represents C(═NOH)NH(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>r</sub> NR<sub>5</sub> R<sub>6</sub> are prepared according to Chem. Ber., 1970, 1, 2330-2335.</p>
    <p>By reducing the compounds of formula IIa, or respectively of formula II or of formula I, in which R<sub>1</sub> represents a cyano group, for example by hydrogenation in the presence of a catalyst such as platinum oxide, followed by reaction with an acid chloride or a suitable anhydride or respectively with a sulphonyl chloride, the compounds of formula IIa, or respectively of formula II or of formula I, in which R<sub>1</sub> represents a group --CH<sub>2</sub> NHCOR<sub>16</sub> or respectively --CH<sub>2</sub> NHSO<sub>2</sub> R'<sub>7</sub> are obtained. Similarly, the compounds of formula IIa, or respectively of formula II or of formula I, in which R<sub>1</sub> represents a group --CH<sub>2</sub> N(R<sub>7</sub>)COR<sub>16</sub> or a group --CH<sub>2</sub> N(R<sub>7</sub>)SO<sub>2</sub> R'<sub>7</sub>, with R<sub>7</sub> other than hydrogen, are obtained by performing an alkylation reaction on the amide obtained in an intermediate step.</p>
    <p>When the hydrogenation of a compound of formula II'a or respectively of formula II' or respectively of formula I', in which R'<sub>1</sub> represents a cyano group is performed in the presence of an amine HNR<sub>5</sub> R<sub>6</sub>, a compound of formula I or respectively of formula II or respectively of formula IIa, in which R<sub>1</sub> represents a group CH<sub>2</sub> NR<sub>5</sub> R<sub>6</sub> is obtained.</p>
    <p>The reaction of the compounds of formula I in which R<sub>1</sub> represents a group TCN or --T--CON(R<sub>7</sub>)(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>q</sub> CN or a group --T--N(R<sub>7</sub>)CO(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>q</sub> CN or a group --SO<sub>2</sub> N(R<sub>7</sub>)(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>q</sub> CN with hydrochloric acid in alcoholic solution AlkOH enables the corresponding imidate of formula:</p>
    <p>--T--C(═NH)OAlk, --T--CONR<sub>7</sub> (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>q</sub> C(═NH)OAlk, --T--N(R<sub>7</sub>)CO--(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>q</sub> C(═NH)OAlk or --SO<sub>2</sub> N(R<sub>7</sub>)(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>q</sub> C(═NH)OAlk in which Alk is a (C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>4</sub>)alkyl</p>
    <p>to be obtained in an intermediate step.</p>
    <p>If the imidate is reacted with an equimolar amount of amine HNR<sub>12</sub> R<sub>13</sub>, the compounds of formula I in which R<sub>1</sub> represents:</p>
    <p>a group --TC(NR<sub>12</sub> R<sub>13</sub>)═NR<sub>14</sub> </p>

    <p>a group --SO<sub>2</sub> N(R<sub>7</sub>)(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>q</sub> C(NR<sub>12</sub> R<sub>13</sub>)═NR<sub>14</sub> with R<sub>14</sub> =H</p>
    <p>are obtained.</p>
    <p>If the imidate is reacted with an excess of amine NH<sub>2</sub> R<sub>13</sub>, in which R<sub>13</sub> is other than hydrogen, the compounds of formula I in which R<sub>1</sub> represents:</p>

    <p>are obtained.</p>
    <p>If the imidate is reacted with a diamine of formula H<sub>2</sub> N--Z--NHR<sub>12</sub>, the compounds of formula I in which R<sub>1</sub> represents:</p>

    <p>a group --TCON(R<sub>7</sub>)(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>q</sub> C(NR<sub>12</sub> R<sub>13</sub>)═N--R<sub>14</sub> or</p>

    <p>A compound of formula (I) in which R<sub>1</sub> contains an optionally substituted amidino radical may also be prepared according to the methods described in The chemistry of amidines and imidates, Saul Patai, 1975, John Wiley and Sons.</p>
    <p>From the compounds of formula I, or respectively of formula II or IIa, in which R<sub>1</sub> represents a group --TCONR<sub>7</sub> (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>q</sub> CN, compounds of formula I, or respectively II or IIa, in which R<sub>1</sub> represents a group --TCONR<sub>7</sub> (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>q</sub> CONH<sub>2</sub> or a group --TCONR<sub>7</sub> (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>q</sub> CO<sub>2</sub> R<sub>7</sub> are prepared by known reactions.</p>
    <p>When R'<sub>1</sub> =SO<sub>3</sub> H, a compound II'a in which R'<sub>1</sub> =SO<sub>2</sub> Cl is prepared and then converted to another compound IIa in which R<sub>1</sub> is an aminosulphonyl group, optionally substituted, by the action of a suitable amine HNR<sub>a</sub> R<sub>b</sub>.</p>
    <p>The compounds of formula I comprising a quaternary ammonium group are obtained from the corresponding amino compounds by the action of a compound of formula QR<sub>24</sub> in which Q can form an anion, for example an iodide.</p>
    <p>The amino acids of formula III include, for example, glycine, alanine, leucine, norleucine, isoleucine, valine, 1-adamantylglycine, 2-adamantylglycine, cyclopropylglycine, cyclopentylglycine, cyclohexylglycine, cycloheptylglycine, 1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid, 1-aminocyclobutanecarboxylic acid, 1-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid, 1-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid, 1-aminocycloheptanecarboxylic acid, 1-amino-4-methylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid, 2-amino-2-adamantanecarboxylic acid, 2-aminobicyclo 3.2.1loctane-2-carboxylic acid, 9-aminobicyclo 3.3.1!nonane-9-carboxylic acid and 2-aminobicyclo 2.2.1!heptane-2-carboxylic or 2-amino-2-norbornanecarboxylic acid.</p>
    <p>The amino acids of formula III are commercial products or may be very readily prepared according to standard methods. In particular, the non-commercial amino acids (III) are prepared according to the Strecker synthesis, Ann, 1850, 75, 27 or according to the synthesis of H. T. Bucherer et al., J. Pract. Chem., 1934, 141, 5, followed by a hydrolysis to yield the amino acids; for example, 2-amino-2-adamantanecarboxylic acid and 9-aminobicyclo 3.3.1!nonane-9-carboxylic acid are prepared according to H. T. Nagasawa et al., J. Med. Chem., 1973, 16, (7), 823.</p>
    <p>α-Amino-1-adamantylacetic and α-amino-2-adamantylacetic acids are prepared according to B. Gaspert et al., Croatica Chemica Acta, 1976, 48 (2), 169-178.</p>

    <p>The compounds of formula (I) and their salts possess a very great affinity for human neurotensin receptors in the tests described by D. Gully et al. in Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1993, 90, 65-69.</p>
    <p>The compounds of formula I and their salts were studied in vivo. Working according to the technique described by M. Poncelet et al. in Naunyn Schmiedberg's Arch. Pharmacol., 1994, 60, 349-357, it is observed that a compound according to the invention, administered orally, antagonizes the contralateral pivoting induced by unilateral intrastriatal injection of neurotensin in mice.</p>
    <p>Moreover, working according to the technique described by D. Nisato et al. in Life Sciences, 1994, 54, 7, 95-100, it is found that a compound according to the invention, administered intravenously, inhibits the increase in blood pressure induced by intravenous injection of neurotensin in guinea pigs.</p>
    <p>The compounds described in Patent EP 0,477,049 exhibit a lower activity in these tests than that of the compounds according to the present invention.</p>
    <p>The compounds of the present invention are of low toxicity; in particular, their acute toxicity is compatible with their use as a medicinal product. For such a use, an effective amount of a compound of formula I, or of one of its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, is administered to mammals for the treatment of neurotensin-dependent pathologies. Thus, the compounds of the present invention may be used for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders, especially those associated with a dysfunction of the dopaminergic systems, for example psychoses, more especially schizophrenia, and diseases of movement such as Parkinson's disease (D. R. Handrich et al., Brain Research, 1982, 231, 216-221 and C. B. Nemeroff, Biological Psychiatry, 1980, 15 (2), 283-302). They may be used to diagnose and/or treat malignant neoplastic diseases, for example human meningiomas which are not surgically accessible (P. Mailleux, Peptides, 1990, 11, 1245-1253), cancers of the prostate (I. Sehgal et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 1994, 91, 4673-4677) and small cell cancers of the lung (T. Sethi et al., Cancer Res., 1991, 51, 3621-3623). They may be used in the treatment of motor, secretory, ulcerous and/or tumoral gastrointestinal disorders (review by A. Shulkes in "Gut Peptides: Biochemistry and Physiology, Ed. J. Waish and G. J. Dockray, 1994"). Thus, the compounds I according to the invention may be used in the treatment of complaints such as: irritable bowel syndrome, diarrhoea, colitis, ulcers, tumours of the gastrointestinal tract, dyspepsia, pancreatitis and oesophagitis. They may also be of value as modulators of food intake (Beck, B. Metabolism, 1995, 44, 972-975). The compounds according to the invention may be indicated as diuretics, as well in the case of cardiovascular disorders, and also in the case of pathologies associated with a histamine release such as inflammatory processes (D. E. Cochrane et al., Faseb J., 1994, 8, 7, 1195). These compounds may also be useful for treating certain disorders caused by stress, such as migraines, neurogenic pruritus and interstitial cystitis (Theoharides T. C. et al., Endocrinol., 1995, 136, 5745-5750). The compounds of the present invention may also be of value in analgesia, by acting on the effects of morphine (M. O. Urban, J. Pharm. Exp. Ther., 1993, 265, 2, 580-586).</p>
    <p>Thus, the subject of the present invention, according to another of its aspects, is pharmaceutical compositions containing as active principles the compounds of formula I or their possible pharmaceutially acceptable salts.</p>
    <p>In the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention for oral, sublingual, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, transdermal or rectal administration, the active principles may be adminisered, in single-dose administration forms, as a mixture or with standard pharmaceutical vehicles, to animals and human beings. Suitable single-dose administration forms comprise forms for oral administration, such as tablets, gelatin capsules, powders, granules and oral solutions or suspensions, forms for administration by inhalation, forms for sublingual and buccal administration, forms for subcutaneous, transcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous administration and forms for rectal administration.</p>
    <p>In order to obtain the desired effect, the dose of active principle can vary between 0.5 and 1000 mg per day, and preferably between 2 and 500 mg.</p>
    <p>Each single dose can contain from 0.5 to 250 mg of active principle, and preferably from 1 to 125 mg, in combination with a pharmaceutical vehicle. This single dose can be administered 1 to 4 times daily.</p>
    <p>When a solid composition is prepared in the form of tablets, the active principle is mixed with a pharmaceutical vehicle such as gelatin, starch, lactose, magnesium stearate, talc, gum arabic or the like. It is possible to coat the tablets with sucrose or with other suitable substances, or they may alternatively be treated in such a way as to have a sustained or delayed activity and to release continuously a predetermined amount of active principle.</p>
    <p>A gelatin capsule preparation is obtained by mixing the active principle with a diluent and pouring the mixture obtained into soft or hard gelatin capsules.</p>
    <p>A preparation in syrup or elixir form can contain the active principle together with a sweetener, preferably a zero-calorie sweetener, and methylparaben and propylparaben as antiseptic, as well as an agent imparting flavour and a suitable colorant.</p>
    <p>The water-dispersible powders or granules can contain the active principle mixed with dispersing agents or wetting agents, or suspending agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone and the like, as well as with sweeteners or flavour correctors.</p>
    <p>For rectal administration, suppositories are employed, which are prepared with binding agents melting at rectal temperature, for example cocoa butter or polyethylene glycols.</p>
    <p>For parenteral administration, aqueous suspenions, isotonic saline solutions or sterile and injectable solutions are used, which contain pharmacologically compatible dispersing and/or wetting agents, for example propylene glycol or butylene glycol.</p>
    <p>The active principle may also be formulated in the form of microcapsules, optionally with one or more vehicles or additives.</p>
    <p>To improve the solubility of the products of the invention, the compounds of formula I or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts may also be presented in the form of complexes with cyclodextrins.</p>
