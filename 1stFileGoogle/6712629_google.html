    <heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading> <p>This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/418,193, filed on Oct. 15, 2002, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>The present invention relates to electrical connections in lamps. More particularly, the invention relates to the connections for lamps which experience high voltage and/or high current.</p>
    <p>2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p>Arc lamps experience high current (e.g., such as up to about 15 A at low voltage) and high voltage (e.g., 800 V at low current). As a result of the power drain associated with this voltage, the exterior of the lamp can reach temperatures around 850° C.</p>
    <p>Currently, there are two methods of making the electrical connection to an arc lamp which will deliver the necessary power to the lamp. A first prior art method is shown in FIGS. 7A, <b>7</b>B in which a lamp electrode <b>105</b> is enclosed in one end of the lamp enclosure <b>106</b>. It is to be understood that the electrical connection may be the same at the other end of the lamp <b>106</b>. According to this method, the lamp electrode <b>105</b> is terminated inside an end fitting <b>102</b>. This end fitting is preferably formed of a ceramic insulating material.</p>
    <p>The electrode <b>105</b> projecting from the lamp <b>106</b> is received within the end fitting <b>102</b> and electrically engages a power line <b>104</b> along a weld joint <b>101</b>. The electrode <b>105</b> and lamp <b>106</b> are held in place in end fitting <b>102</b> using non-conductive potting material <b>128</b>. The power line <b>104</b>, which is preferably a high-temperature wire of about 8″-14″ in length, is flexible and is wrapped in a high-temperature insulation <b>108</b> at substantially all points between the weld joint <b>101</b> and an electrical connector <b>107</b> which is provided at a distal end of the power line <b>104</b> and which has a hole therein.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 7B, the connector <b>107</b> is adapted to receive a metal fastener <b>109</b> which may be in the form of a screw, as shown. The fastener <b>109</b> also receives a similar electrical connector <b>114</b> of a second power line <b>116</b> which is integrally connected to a power source and which is also preferably wrapped in high-temperature insulation <b>108</b>. When the fastener <b>109</b> receives both electrical connectors <b>107</b>, <b>114</b>, an electrical connection is established between the first power line <b>104</b> and the second power line <b>116</b>. Further, to maintain the electrical connection, the fastener <b>109</b> is fastened to a standoff <b>110</b> which is connected to the lamp housing <b>112</b>, e.g., the fastener <b>109</b> may be screwed into the standoff <b>110</b>.</p>
    <p>In the second method, which is shown in FIGS. 8A and 8B, an internal electrical connection is made between a metallic end fitting <b>130</b> and a lamp electrode <b>105</b> projecting from one end of a lamp <b>106</b>. It is to be understood that the connection may be the same at the other end of the lamp <b>106</b>. The electrode <b>105</b> is received by the metallic end fitting <b>130</b> thereby establishing an electrical connection <b>126</b> between the electrode <b>105</b> and the end fitting <b>130</b> which is preferably formed of metal. Electrode <b>105</b> and lamp <b>106</b> are held in place to end fitting <b>130</b> using nonconductive potting material <b>128</b>.</p>
    <p>The end fitting <b>130</b> is received within a recess <b>137</b> formed in an insulating block <b>134</b> which is preferably formed out of a ceramic material. Positioned in the recess <b>137</b> is a proximal end <b>142</b> of a power line <b>140</b> which is preferably a high-temperature wire. Substantially all of the power line extending beyond the insultating block <b>134</b> is wrapped in a high-temperature insulation <b>108</b>. When the end fitting <b>130</b> is received in the recess <b>137</b>, the outer collar of the metallic end fitting <b>130</b> contacts the distal end <b>142</b> of the power line <b>140</b> thereby electrically connecting the power line <b>140</b> and the electrode <b>105</b>.</p>
    <p>A clamp <b>131</b>, such as a c-shaped clamp, may be positioned on top of the end fitting <b>130</b> to hold the end fitting <b>130</b> in the recess <b>137</b>. Without a clamp, the electrical connection between the end fitting <b>130</b> and the power source will be unstable. Accordingly, fasteners <b>139</b> are typically used to lock the clamp <b>131</b> onto the block <b>134</b>; the fasteners may pass through holes <b>133</b> in the clamp <b>131</b> and be received in bores <b>135</b> in the block <b>134</b>. A distal end <b>143</b> of the power line <b>140</b> is connected to an electrical connector <b>144</b> which is adapted to be connected to a power source.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the first of the aforementioned methods of supplying power to the lamp requires the use of insulating standoffs <b>110</b> configured with threaded holes in which the fasteners <b>109</b> connect the lamp wire with the wire from the power source. In the second method, to establish a stable connection, fasteners <b>139</b> and a clamp <b>131</b> must be employed to lock the end fitting into the insulating block <b>134</b>. Thus, although two solutions currently exists to transmit power to an arc lamp, the solutions require the use of additional parts which have a cost associated therewith. In addition, the connections require the fastening and unfastening of fasteners (e.g., turning of the screws) which is not only time consuming, it is also problematic as the fastener or standoff may be damaged. For example, the threads of the screw may become stripped thereby making the connection unstable and/or difficult to disconnect.</p>
    <p>In light of the aforementioned, it is desired to achieve one or more of the following in a new apparatus and method for an electrical connection: (a) effectively transmit power to an arc lamp; (b) reduce the number of necessary parts and/or production costs; and/or (c) easily establish and disestablish an electrical connection in an arc lamp.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading> <p>Reference will now be made in detail to presently preferred embodiments of the invention, which are illustrated in the drawings. An effort has been made to use the same reference numbers throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.</p>
    <p>FIG. 1 is perspective view of a connective housing <b>10</b> in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention. The housing <b>10</b>, which is preferably formed of a flexible and nonconductive material, has a front side <b>12</b>, a right side <b>14</b>, a left side <b>16</b>, a solid rear side <b>18</b>, and a base <b>20</b>. A substantially cylindrical bore <b>22</b> is provided through the housing <b>10</b> from the left side <b>16</b> to the right side <b>14</b>. The cylindrical bore <b>22</b> is adapted to receive an arc lamp end fitting <b>52</b>, as later described in detail.</p>
    <p>Provided in the front side <b>12</b> is a gap <b>24</b> which extends from the left side <b>16</b> to the right side <b>14</b> and which terminates in the cylindrical bore <b>22</b>. The gap <b>24</b> is adapted to receive a female electrical connector <b>50</b>, as later described in detail. Also formed in the front side <b>12</b> is slot <b>26</b> which together with a bore <b>27</b> forms an electrical connector container <b>29</b>. The electrical connector container <b>29</b> is substantially transverse to cylindrical bore <b>22</b> and terminates therein. Positioned within the electrical connector container <b>29</b> is a male electrical connector <b>30</b>, as shown in the front view of FIG. 2B. A lower end of the electrical connector container <b>29</b> serves as an outlet portion <b>28</b> through which a wire connector <b>31</b> (such as, for example, a wire) passes to connect the male electrical connector <b>30</b> to a power supply (not shown).</p>
    <p>The male electrical connector <b>30</b> is a conductor which is adapted to transmit current supplied to it from an external power supply via the wire connector <b>31</b>. The wire connector <b>31</b> is connected to the power supply and to the male connector <b>30</b> via the outlet portion <b>28</b> in such a manner that the connections can not be readily disengaged. Preferably, the wire connector <b>31</b> is integrally connected to the power supply and/or the male connector <b>30</b>. The male connector <b>30</b> will transmit current supplied thereto by the power supply when it contacts another conductor such as, for example, a socket <b>51</b> of a female electrical connector <b>50</b>, as later described in detail.</p>
    <p>Preferably, the male electrical connector <b>30</b> is spring loaded, i.e., it is biased by a spring <b>32</b>, positioned adjacent a lower end thereof, to project upward toward the cylindrical bore <b>22</b>, as shown in FIGS. 2B and 6A. Further, the male electrical connector <b>30</b> may be electrically connected to the spring <b>32</b> which, in turn, may be electrically connected to wire connector <b>31</b>.</p>
    <p>The top end <b>34</b> of the male electrical connector <b>30</b> is preferably rounded or inclined in shape such that when an object (such as, for example, a female electrical connector <b>50</b>) strikes the end <b>34</b> from the side or at an angle, the male electrical connector <b>30</b> will be forced (against the action of the spring <b>32</b>) downward in the electrical connector container <b>29</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>6</b>B. However, as a result of the force exerted by the spring <b>32</b>, the top end <b>34</b> will remain in contact with the object which forces the male electrical connector <b>30</b> downward in the electrical connector container <b>29</b>. As will be clearer later, if the object which depresses the male electrical connector <b>30</b> is a female electrical connector <b>50</b> and if the female electrical connector <b>50</b> is rotated far enough, the male electrical connector <b>50</b> will be adapted to engage a socket <b>51</b> formed on the end of the female electrical connector <b>50</b>, thereby establishing a stable electrical connection between the male and female electrical connectors <b>30</b>, <b>50</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 3A is a perspective end view of a right end <b>62</b> of an arc lamp <b>60</b> having an arc lamp end fitting <b>52</b> projecting therefrom. A female electrical connector <b>50</b>, which has a socket <b>51</b> therein and which projects from the arc lamp end fitting <b>52</b>, is adapted to contact, and to engage electrically, the conductive male electrical connector <b>30</b>. In one embodiment, shown in FIG. 3B, the arc lamp end fitting <b>52</b> contains a nonconductive potting material <b>66</b> into which the female electrical connector <b>50</b> projects to establish electrical contact with an electrode <b>105</b> of the lamp <b>60</b>. Further, the female electrical connector <b>50</b> may be soldered, brazed, crimped, stake, clamped, etc., onto the electrode <b>105</b> projecting from the end of the lamp <b>60</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 4, the arc lamp end fitting <b>52</b>, which projects from a right end <b>62</b> of the arc lamp <b>60</b>, is designed to slide into the cylindrical bore <b>22</b>. The cylindrical bore <b>22</b> has a diameter which is substantially the same as, but slightly greater than, the diameter of the arc lamp end fitting <b>52</b>. The arc lamp end fitting <b>52</b> will slide into the bore <b>22</b>, provided the female electrical connector <b>50</b> projecting therefrom is aligned with the gap <b>24</b>. When the arc lamp end fitting <b>52</b> is sufficiently pushed into the cylindrical bore <b>22</b>, the female electrical connector <b>50</b> projecting therefrom will align with the electrical connector container <b>29</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>6</b>A. At this point, the lamp <b>60</b> may be rotated so that the female electrical connector <b>50</b> may swing downward into the electrical connector container <b>29</b>. Further, as the female electrical connector <b>50</b> swings downward, it will force the top end <b>34</b> of the male electrical connector <b>30</b> downward into the electrical connector container <b>29</b>. With a continued rotation of the female electrical connector <b>50</b>, the male electrical connector <b>30</b> will align with, and thereafter engage, the socket <b>51</b> formed in the end of the female electrical connector <b>50</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>6</b>B.</p>
    <p>When female electrical connector <b>50</b> contacts and pushes the male electrical connector <b>30</b>, an electrical connection will be established between the female electrical connector <b>50</b> and the male electrical connector <b>30</b>. Further, when the male electrical connector <b>30</b> engages the socket <b>51</b>, a stable connection will be established. In one embodiment, the male electrical connector <b>30</b> may penetrate the socket <b>51</b>, thereby forcing fan members <b>53</b> thereof to expand radially outward and increasing the contact between the male and female electrical connectors <b>30</b>, <b>50</b>. In addition, the stability of the connection is also enhanced because: (a) the vertical motion of the female electrical connector <b>50</b> is inhibited by arc lamp end fitting <b>52</b> abutting the wall of the cylindrical bore <b>22</b>; and (b) the male electrical connector <b>30</b> is upwardly biased by the spring <b>32</b> into the female electrical connector <b>50</b>. Accordingly, the electrical connection between the male electrical connector <b>30</b> and the female electrical connector <b>50</b> is continuously stable.</p>
    <p>It is also possible to engage electrically the male electrical connector <b>30</b> and the female electrical connector <b>50</b> prior to positioning the arc lamp end fitting <b>52</b> in the housing <b>10</b>. One way to achieve this result is to engage the male electrical connector and the socket <b>51</b> of the female electrical connector <b>50</b>. After this is completed, the arc lamp end fitting <b>52</b> may be pushed into the cylindrical bore <b>22</b>, provided the female electrical connector <b>50</b> (with the male electrical connector <b>30</b> attached thereto) is aligned with the gap <b>24</b>. When the arc lamp end fitting <b>52</b> is pushed sufficiently into the housing <b>10</b> so that the male and female electrical connectors <b>30</b>, <b>50</b> align with the slot <b>24</b>, the spring <b>32</b> under the male electrical connector <b>30</b> may be compressed while the lamp <b>60</b> is rotated. If the spring <b>32</b> is sufficiently compressed, it will pass into the electrical connector container <b>29</b> along with the male and female electrical connectors <b>30</b>, <b>50</b>. Once the male and female electrical connectors <b>30</b>, <b>50</b> are positioned in the electrical connector container <b>29</b>, the spring <b>32</b> may be released allowing it to abut the bottom <b>20</b> of the housing; the spring <b>32</b> will not, however, extended to its uncompressed length.</p>
    <p>Another method of connecting the male and female electrical connectors <b>30</b>, <b>50</b> prior to inserting them in the housing would entail the following. The arc lamp end fitting <b>52</b> could be positioned against the gap <b>24</b> so that the male and female electrical connectors <b>30</b>, <b>50</b> are aligned with the slot <b>26</b>. If the housing <b>10</b> is sufficiently pliable, the top side thereof can be temporarily pushed upward by the arc lamp end fitting <b>52</b> so that the arc lamp end fitting <b>52</b> snaps into the cylindrical bore <b>22</b>, moving in a direction from the front side <b>12</b> toward the rear side <b>18</b>. When the arc lamp end fitting <b>52</b> is received by the bore <b>22</b>, the lamp <b>60</b> could be rotated and the spring <b>32</b> compressed in a manner similar to that previously described so that the male and female electrical connectors <b>30</b>, <b>50</b> can rotate into the electrical connector container <b>29</b>.</p>
    <p>It should be readily apparent that a left end <b>64</b> of the arc lamp <b>60</b> can be similarly engaged to another housing <b>10</b>. When the housings <b>10</b> are identical, one possible method of inserting the arc lamp end fittings <b>52</b> on the lamp <b>60</b> into each of the cylindrical bores <b>22</b> in the two housings <b>10</b> may entail enabling at least one of the housings <b>10</b> to be mobile. In this embodiment, the arc lamp end fitting <b>52</b> on a first end <b>62</b> of the lamp <b>60</b> could slide into the cylindrical bore <b>22</b> in the housing <b>10</b> associated therewith and then the second housing <b>10</b> could then slide onto the arc lamp end fitting <b>52</b> on the other end <b>64</b> of the lamp <b>60</b>. The arc lamp <b>60</b> could then be rotated so as to force the female electrical connectors <b>50</b> downward into the respective electrical connector containers <b>29</b>, thereby establishing electrical connections with the respective male electrical connectors <b>30</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>5</b>. Thereafter the second housing <b>10</b> may be immobilized (if desired), for example, by fastening it to a surface (not shown).</p>
    <p>In another embodiment, however, each of the housings may be identical (to reduce manufacturing cost) and may be permanently affixed to a surface (not shown), so that the apparatus will be more readily usable. In this embodiment, the diameter of the cylindrical bore <b>22</b> may not only be slightly greater than the diameter of the arc lamp end fitting <b>52</b> projecting from both ends of a lamp <b>60</b>, it may also be greater than the diameter of the light emitting portion of the lamp <b>60</b>.</p>
    <p>In this embodiment, to establish an electrical connection between the male and female electrical connectors <b>30</b>, <b>50</b> in each of the housings <b>10</b>, the arc lamp end fitting <b>52</b> on one end of the lamp <b>60</b> may be pushed entirely through the outer side of a first of the two housings <b>10</b>. The lamp <b>60</b> will continue to be pushed until that arc lamp end fitting <b>52</b> is received in the cylindrical bore <b>22</b> in the second of the two housings <b>10</b>. At that time, the other arc lamp end fitting <b>52</b> will be received in the first housing <b>10</b>. As with the previously described embodiment, when the female connectors <b>50</b> are aligned with the electrical connector containers <b>29</b>, the lamp <b>60</b> may be rotated to force the female electrical connectors <b>50</b> downward into the electrical connector containers <b>29</b> to engage the male electrical connectors <b>30</b>, thereby creating the connection shown in FIG. <b>5</b>.</p>
    <p>In addition, either of the two previously discussed methods of connecting a male <b>30</b> and a female <b>50</b> electrical connector prior to immobilizing the connection in a housing <b>10</b> can be incorporated into any of the previously discussed methods of creating electrical connections on both ends of the arc lamp <b>60</b>. For example, if two immobile housings <b>10</b> are provided, the each male and female electrical connector <b>30</b>, <b>50</b> could be connected to its respective male and female electrical connector <b>30</b>, <b>50</b>. At that time, a first of the two arc lamp end fittings <b>52</b> could be pushed through a first of the housings <b>10</b> and into a second of the housings <b>10</b>, at which time the other arc lamp end fitting <b>52</b> will be received in the first housing <b>10</b>. When the joined male and female electrical connectors <b>30</b>, <b>50</b> are aligned with their respective electrical connector container <b>29</b>, the springs <b>32</b> under the male electrical connectors <b>30</b> may be depressed and the lamp <b>60</b> rotated so that the male and female electrical connectors <b>30</b>, <b>50</b> are received in their respective electrical connector containers <b>29</b>, at which time the compression of the springs <b>32</b> may be discontinued.</p>
    <p>As the male electrical connectors <b>30</b> are integrally connected to a power supply, the present invention eliminates the need for the insulating standoffs <b>110</b>, fasteners <b>109</b> (e.g., screw), and the need to use tools (e.g., screwdriver) to secure the connection. To maintain the integral electrical connection between a housing <b>10</b> and a power source, the spring <b>32</b> (which is electrically connected to the male electrical connector <b>30</b>) must withstand the temperature of the environment inside the housing <b>10</b>, resist corrosion, and be compatable with the material (and any plating thereof) forming the electrical connector container <b>26</b>.</p>
    <p>Although the aforementioned describes embodiments of the invention, the invention is not so restricted. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the disclosed preferred embodiments of the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. For example, although the aforementioned electrical connection between the male electrical connector <b>30</b> and the female electrical connector <b>50</b> was described with respect to an arc lamp, the invention is not limited to arc lamps. Rather, the electrical connection could be used in any circuit requiring a connection between two or more electrical connectors. In addition, although the housing has been described as a multisided structure, it can be any shape provided it satisfies the electrical engagements previously discussed. Accordingly, it should be understood that the apparatus and method described herein are illustrative only and are not limiting upon the scope of the invention, which is indicated by the following claims.</p>
