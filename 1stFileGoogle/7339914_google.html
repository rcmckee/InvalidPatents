  <p num="p-0003">This present application is also related to U.S. Ser. No. 10/931,926 filed on the same date, commonly assigned, and hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/543,632, titled “An Automated Method and an RF Sensor System for Wireless Unauthorized Transmission, Intrusion Detection and Prevention,” filed Feb. 10, 2004, commonly assigned, and hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.</p>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0004">The present invention relates generally to wireless computer networking techniques. More particularly, the invention provides a sniffer apparatus and method for providing intrusion detection for local area wireless networks according to a specific embodiment. Merely by way of example, the invention has been applied to a computer networking environment based upon the IEEE 802.11 family of standards, commonly called “WiFi.” But it would be recognized that the invention has a much broader range of applicability. For example, the invention can be applied to Ultra Wide Band (“UWB”), IEEE 802.16 commonly known as “WiMAX”, Bluetooth, and others.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">Computer systems proliferated from academic and specialized science applications to day to day business, commerce, information distribution and home applications. Such systems include personal computers, which are often called “PCs” for short, to large mainframe and server class computers. Powerful mainframe and server class computers run specialized applications for banks, small and large companies, e-commerce vendors and governments. Smaller personal computers can be found in many if not all offices, homes, and even local coffee shops. These computers interconnect with each other through computer communication networks based on packet switching technology such as the Internet protocol or IP. The computer systems located within a specific local geographic area such as office, home or other indoor and outdoor premises interconnect using a Local Area Network, commonly called, LAN. Ethernet is by far the most popular networking technology for LANs. The LANs interconnect with each other using a Wide Area Network called “WAN” such as the famous Internet. Although much progress occurred with computers and networking, we now face a variety of security threats on many computing environments from the hackers connected to the computer network. The application of wireless communication to computer networking further accentuates these threats.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">As merely an example, the conventional LAN is usually deployed using an Ethernet based infrastructure comprising cables, hubs switches, and other elements. A number of connection ports (e.g., Ethernet ports) are used to couple various computer systems to the LAN. A user can connect to the LAN by physically attaching a computing device such as laptop, desktop or handheld computer to one of the connection ports using physical wires or cables. Other computer systems such as database computers, server computers, routers and Internet gateways also connect to the LAN to provide specific functionalities and services. Once physically connected to the LAN, the user often accesses a variety of services such as file transfer, remote login, email, WWW, database access, and voice over IP. Security of the LAN often occurs by controlling access to the physical space where the LAN connection ports reside.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">Although conventional wired networks using Ethernet technology proliferated, wireless communication technologies are increasing in popularity. That is, wireless communication technologies wirelessly connect users to the computer communication networks. A typical application of these technologies provides wireless access to the local area network in the office, home, public hot-spots, and other geographical locations. As merely an example, the IEEE 802.11 family of standards, commonly called WiFi, is the common standard for such wireless application. Among WiFi, the 802.11b standard-based WiFi often operates at 2.4 GHz unlicensed radio frequency spectrum and offers wireless connectivity at speeds up to 11 Mbps. The 802.11g compliant WiFi offers even faster connectivity at about 54 Mbps and operates at 2.4 GHz unlicensed radio frequency spectrum. The 802.11a provides speeds up to 54 Mbps operating in the 5 GHz unlicensed radio frequency spectrum. The WiFi enables a quick and effective way of providing wireless extension to the existing LAN.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">In order to provide wireless extension of the LAN using WiFi, one or more WiFi access points (APs) connect to the LAN connection ports either directly or through intermediate equipment such as WiFi switch. A user now wirelessly connects to the LAN using a device equipped with WiFi radio, commonly called wireless station, that communicates with the AP. The connection is free from cable and other physical encumbrances and allows the user to “Surf the Web” or check e-mail in an easy and efficient manner. Unfortunately, certain limitations still exist with WiFi. That is, the radio waves often cannot be contained in the physical space bounded by physical structures such as the walls of a building. Hence, wireless signals often spill outside the area of interest. Unauthorized users can wirelessly connect to the AP and hence gain access to the LAN from the spillage areas such as the street, parking lot, and neighbor's premises. Consequently, the conventional security measure of controlling access to the physical space where the LAN connection ports are located is now inadequate.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">In order to prevent unauthorized access to the LAN over WiFi, the AP implements one or more of a variety of techniques. For example, the user is required to carry out authentication handshake with the AP (or a WiFi switch that resides between the AP and the existing LAN) before being able to connect to the LAN. Examples of such handshake are Wireless Equivalent Privacy (WEP) based shared key authentication, 802.1x based port access control, 802.11i based authentication. The AP can provide additional security measures such as encryption, firewall. Other techniques also exist to enhance security of the LAN over WiFi.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">Despite these measures, many limitations still exist. As merely an example, a threat of an unauthorized AP being connected to the LAN often remains with the LANs. The unauthorized AP creates a security vulnerability. The unauthorized AP allows wireless intruders to connect to the LAN through itself. That is, the intruder accesses the LAN and any proprietary information on computers and servers on the LAN without the knowledge of the owner of the LAN. Soft APs, ad hoc networks, and misconfigured APs connected to the LAN also pose similar threats. Appropriate security mechanisms are thus needed to protect the LAN resources from wireless intruders.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">Accordingly, techniques for improving security for local area network environments are highly desirable.</p>
  <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0012">According to the present invention, techniques directed to wireless computer networking are provided.

  <p num="p-0034">One or more unauthorized APs can be connected to the LAN. The figure shows unauthorized AP <b>119</b> connected to the LAN connection port <b>120</b>. The unauthorized AP may not employ the right security policies. Also traffic through this AP may bypass security policy enforcing elements such as WiFi switch <b>114</b> or firewall/VPN gateway <b>112</b>. The AP <b>119</b> thus poses a security threat as intruders such as wireless station <b>126</b> can connect to the LAN and launch variety of attacks through this AP. According to a specific embodiment, the unauthorized AP can be a rogue AP, a misconfigured AP, a soft AP, and the like. A rougue AP can be a commodity AP such as the one available openly in the market that is brought in by the person having physical access to the facility and connected to the LAN via the LAN connection port without the permission of the network administrator. A misconfigured AP can be the AP otherwise allowed by the network administrator, but whose security parameters are, usually inadvertently, incorrectly configured. Such an AP can thus allow wireless intruders to connect to it. Soft AP is usually a “WiFi” enabled computer system connected to the LAN connection port that also functions as an AP under the control of software. The software is either deliberately run on the computer system or inadvertently in the form of a virus program.</p>
  <p num="p-0035">The figure also shows neighbor's AP <b>121</b> whose radio coverage spills into the area covered by LAN. The AP <b>121</b> is however not connected to the concerned LAN <b>101</b> and is harmless from the intrusion standpoint. According to a specific embodiment, the neighbor's AP can be an AP in the neighboring office, an AP is the laboratory not connected to the concerned LAN but used for standalone development and/or experimentation, an AP on the street providing free “WiFi” access to passersby and other APs, which co-exist with the LAN and share the airspace without any significant and/or harmful interferences.</p>
  <p num="p-0036">A WiFi AP delivers data packets between the wired LAN and the wireless transmission medium. Typically, the AP performs this function either by acting as a layer <b>2</b> bridge or as a network address translator (NAT). The layer <b>2</b> bridge type AP simply transmits the Ethernet packet received on its wired interface to the wireless link after translating it to 802.11 style packet and vice versa. The NAT AP on the other hand acts as a layer <b>3</b> (IP) router that routes IP packets received on its wired interface to the stations connected to its wireless interface and vice versa. The wired side and wireless side interfaces of the NAT AP thus usually reside on different subnets.</p>
  <p num="p-0037">The intrusion detection system according to the present invention is provided to protect the LAN <b>101</b> from unauthorized APs and/or wireless intruders. The system involves one or more sensor devices <b>122</b>A, <b>122</b>B (i.e., sniffers) placed throughout a geographic region or a portion of geographic region including the connection points to the LAN <b>101</b>. The sniffer is able to monitor the wireless activity in the selected geographic region. For example, the sniffer listens to the radio channel and capture packets being transmitted on the channel. The sniffer cycles through the radio channels on which wireless communication can take place. On each radio channel, it waits and listens for any ongoing transmission. In one embodiment, the sniffer is able operate on plurality of radio channels simultaneously. Whenever transmission is detected, the relevant information about that transmission is collected and recorded. This information comprises of all or a subset of information that can be gathered from various fields in the captured packet such as 802.11 MAC (medium access control) header, 802.2 LLC (i.e., logical link control) header, IP header, transport protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP, HTTP, RTP etc.) headers, packet size, packet payload and other fields. Receive signal strength (i.e., RSSI) may also be recorded. Other information such as the day and the time of the day when said transmission was detected may also be recorded.</p>
  <p num="p-0038">According to a specific embodiment, the sniffer device can be any suitable receiving/transmitting device capable of detecting wireless activity. As merely an example, the sniffer often has a smaller form factor. The sniffer device has a processor, a flash memory (where the software code for sniffer functionality resides), a RAM, two 802.11a/b/g wireless network interface cards (NICs), one Ethernet port (with optional power over Ethernet or POE), a serial port, a power input port, a pair of dual-band (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) antennas, and at least one status indicator light emitting diode. The sniffer can be built using the hardware platform similar to one used to built wireless access point, although functionality and software will be different for a sniffer device. Of course, one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives. Further details of the sniffers are provided throughout the present specification and more particularly below.</p>
  <p num="p-0039">One or more sniffers <b>122</b>A and <b>122</b>B may also be provided with radio transmit interface which is useful to perform intrusion prevention procedures, i.e., to perform preventive action against detected intrusion. In one specific embodiment, the sniffer is a dual slot device which has two wireless NICs. These NICs can be used in a variety of combinations, for example both for monitoring, both form transmitting, one for monitoring and the other for transmitting etc., under the control of software. In another specific embodiment, the sniffer has only one wireless NIC. The same NIC is shared in a time division multiplexed fashion to carry out monitoring as well as defense against intrusion. The radio transmit interface of the sniffer is also used to perform certain other transmission procedures according to some embodiments of the method of invention, for example transmission of market packet in some embodiments of the LAN connectivity test, transmission of active probe packets, and the like. Each sniffer also has Ethernet NIC using which it is connected to the connection port <b>123</b> of the LAN. The sniffers can be spatially disposed at appropriate locations in the geographic area to be monitored for intrusion by using one or more of heuristics, strategy and calculated guess. Alternatively, a more systematic approach using an RF (radio frequency) planning tool is used to determine physical locations where said sniffers need to be deployed according to an alternative embodiment of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0040">In a specific embodiment, the sniffer device captures wireless activity. Such wireless activity includes, among others, transmission of control, management or data packet between an AP and a wireless station or among wireless stations, and communication for establishing wireless connection between an AP and a wireless station often called association.

  <p num="p-0048"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a simplified illustration of a sniffer apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention. This diagram is merely an illustration, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims herein. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, modifications, and alternatives. As shown, the invention provides a wireless sniffer apparatus including an automated intrusion detection process. The apparatus has housing <b>11</b>, which is characterized by a length no greater than a first dimension, a width no greater than a second dimension, and a height of no greater than a third dimension. Preferably, the housing has a length no greater than a first dimension of about 40 centimeters, a width no greater than a second dimension of about 25 centimeters, and a height of no greater than a third dimension of about 10 centimeters. The housing may be made of metal or plastic, which is suitable in strength and durable. The housing encloses circuitry including chips, memory devices, wireless and wired network interface devices etc., which will be described in more detail below.</p>
  <p num="p-0049">In a specific embodiment, the apparatus has a processing unit (e.g., operable at a clock speed of more than 10 MHz) within the housing and one or more wireless network interface devices (e.g., transmitter/receiver) within the housing and coupled to the processing unit. The apparatus has one or more antennas <b>12</b> coupled to the one or more wireless network interface devices.

  <p num="p-0050">Preferably, the sniffer device is easy to install on a given geographic region, as illustrated by the simplified diagram of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. Here, the method provides a method for installing one or more security devices over a selected local geographic region. As shown in step <b>21</b>, the method includes providing a wireless sniffer apparatus including an automated intrusion detection process, such as those described herein. The method includes connecting the network connector of the sniffer apparatus to the local area network, step <b>22</b>. The method includes executing computer codes directed to testing connectivity of at least an other device associated with the detected wireless activity to the local area network as shown in step <b>23</b> and outputting either the first output indication or the second output indication based upon the detected wireless activity as shown in step <b>24</b>. Further details of various methods being carried out in the sniffer apparatus including a block diagram can be found throughout the present specification and more particularly below.</p>
  <p num="p-0051"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the logical flow of steps for wireless intrusion detection according to the method of the invention. This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims herein. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives. As shown, the first step <b>201</b> is to maintain the list of active APs called the Active_AP_List. An active AP is defined as the AP that was recently involved in the wireless transmission as the sender or the receiver. An active AP can be detected by analyzing the wireless transmission on the radio channel captured by the sniffer. For example, every AP in the WiFi network periodically transmits a beacon packet for the client wireless stations to be able to connect to it. The beacon packet contains information such as clock synchronization data, AP's MAC address (BSSID), supported data rates, service set identifiers (SSIDs), parameters for the contention and contention-free access to the wireless medium, capabilities as regards QoS, security policy, etc. In one embodiment, detection of beacon packet transmission from an AP is used to identify said AP to be an active AP. Beacon packet can be recognized from the type and subtype fields in the 802.11 MAC header of the beacon packet. In alternate embodiments, active AP can also be detected when any other wireless transmission (data, control or management packet) directed to or generating from it is observed by the sniffer. Whenever an active AP is detected, it is added to the Active_AP_List. If the Active_AP_List already contains entry for said AP, the corresponding entry is refreshed. Associated with each entry in the Active_AP_List are a short timeout and a long timeout values. After a short timeout, the corresponding entry is marked “inactive” and after a long timeout it is marked “historic”. The logical flow of steps for maintaining the Active_AP_List is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims herein. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">The second step <b>202</b> is to classify the APs in Active_AP_List into at least three categories, namely “authorized”, “unauthorized” and “external”. The authorized APs are defined to be the APs which are allowed to be connected to the LAN by the network administrator. The unauthorized APs are defined to be the APs that are not allowed to be connected to the LAN, but are still connected to the LAN. The unauthorized APs pose a security threat. The external APs are defined to be the APs whose active presence can be detected by the sniffers but they are not connected to the LAN. For example, these can be neighbor's APs whose radio coverage spills into the physical space of interest. The external APs do not pose a security threat. One or more tests are performed to classify APs in the Active_AP_List into these categories.</p>
  <p num="p-0053">The third step <b>203</b> is intrusion detection. When an unauthorized AP is detected, intrusion alert is generated. Whenever any wireless station attempting connection to or connected to unauthorized AP is detected, intrusion alert is generated. Once the intrusion alert is generated, the method sends an indication of the AP and/or intruding wireless station to a prevention process. Preferably, the indication is sent almost immediately or before the transmission of one or few more packets by intruders. Depending upon the embodiment, the method sends the indication via an inter process signal between various processes, which can be provided in computer codes. Alternatively, the method performs a selected function within the same process code to implement the prevention process. Further details of the prevention process can be found throughout the present specification and more particularly below.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">The fourth step <b>204</b> is intrusion prevention wherein subsequent to intrusion alert; action is taken to disable or disrupt any communication between unauthorized AP and intruding wireless station. One embodiment of this step works by preventing or breaking the “association” between unauthorized AP and intruding wireless station. Association is the procedure defined in 802.11 standard wherein the wireless station and the AP establish a wireless connection between them. Techniques for preventing or breaking the association include but are not limited to sending one or more spoofed “deauthentication” packets from one or more sniffers with AP's MAC address as source address with a reason code “Authentication Expired” to a particular intruding wireless station or to a broadcast address, sending one or more spoofed De-Authentication packets from one or more sniffers to unauthorized AP with intruding wireless station's MAC address as source address with reason code “Auth Leave”, sending one or more spoofed “disassociation” packets from one or more sniffers with AP's MAC address as source address to a particular intruding wireless station or to a broadcast address and sending one or more spoofed disassociation packets from one or more sniffers to unauthorized AP with intruding wireless station's MAC address as source address. Another embodiment of this step involves continuously sending frames from one or more sniffers with BSSID field containing MAC address of unauthorized AP and a high value in network allocation vector (NAV) field. All client wireless stations of said AP including said intruding wireless station then defer access to radio channel for the duration specified in NAV field. This causes disruption to the communication between said AP and said intruding wireless station. A number of other embodiments such as inflicting acknowledgement (ACK) or packet collisions via transmissions from the sniffer, destabilizing or desynchronizing the wireless stations within the BSS (basic service set) of unauthorized AP by sending confusing beacon frames from the sniffer can also be used.</p>
  <p num="p-0055">In the preferred embodiment of the method of invention, in step <b>202</b> a test called the “LAN connectivity test” is used to distinguish the APs in the Active_AP_List that are connected to the LAN (e.g., authorized or unauthorized) from those that are not connected to the LAN (e.g., external). The logical flow of steps according to an embodiment of the LAN connectivity test is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims herein. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives. As shown in step <b>401</b>, one or more marker packets are transmitted to the LAN by the originating device. The originating device can be a sniffer. For example, the sniffer can transmit the marker packet to the concerned LAN via the Ethernet port. The marker packet has a peculiar format using which it can later be identified by the intrusion detection system. The format can be different for different marker packets. The marker packet may contain a sequence number using which it can later be compared against the known marker packets. The marker packet may contain identity of the originating device. The marker packet is received by all or a subset of APs connected to the concerned LAN and transmitted by all or a subset of them on the wireless medium.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">In step <b>402</b>, one or more sniffers listen to one or more radio channels on which wireless communication can take place.</p>
  <p num="p-0057">In step <b>403</b>, at least one sniffer detects the transmission of at least one marker packet on the radio channel. The marker packet is detected by analyzing the format of the captured packet. If the AP transmits marker packet on the radio channel without modifying it via encryption procedure all the format information in the detected packet is available to the intrusion detection system for analysis for identifying marker packet. If the AP transmits marker packet on the radio channel after modifying it via encryption procedure the intrusion detection system may not be able to analyze all the format information in the detected packet. In this case, certain features of the packet format that are unaffected by encryption procedure are used for analysis. For example, the encryption procedure does not change the size of the data being encrypted. Thus the size of detected packets can be used as a format parameter to identify said packet as the marker packet.</p>
  <p num="p-0058">Then in step <b>404</b> the identity of the AP that transmits the marker packet is determined from the 802.11 MAC header (for example from the transmitter address or BSSID fields) of the packet transmitted on the radio channel.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">In step <b>405</b>, the AP that transmits the marker packet is declared to be connected to the LAN. In a preferred embodiment, the corresponding entry in the Active AP List is marked as “connected to the LAN”.</p>
  <p num="p-0060">In one embodiment of the above method, the marker packet is an Ethernet style packet addressed to the broadcast address, i.e., the value of hexadecimal ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff in the destination address field of Ethernet MAC header. This packet will be received by all APs that are present in the LAN broadcast domain. The APs among these acting as layer <b>2</b> bridges then transmit this broadcast packet on the wireless medium after translating it to the 802.11 style packet.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">In alternate embodiment, the marker packet is an Ethernet style unicast packet addressed to the MAC address of a wireless station associated with an AP. Said MAC address is inferred by analyzing the prior communication between said wireless station and said AP captured by the sniffer. This packet will be received by said AP if it is connected to the concerned LAN. Said AP acting as layer <b>2</b> bridge then transmits the marker packet on the wireless medium after translating it to the 802.11 style packet.</p>
  <p num="p-0062">In another alternate embodiment, the marker packet is an IP packet addressed to the IP address of a wireless station associated with an AP. Said IP address is inferred by analyzing the prior communication between said wireless station and said AP that is captured by the sniffer. This packet will be received by said AP if it is connected to the concerned LAN and transmitted by said AP on the wireless medium after translating it to the 802.11 style packet.</p>
  <p num="p-0063">In yet an alternate embodiment, the marker packet is an IP packet addressed to the broadcast IP address of the LAN.</p>
  <p num="p-0064">In one embodiment, the marker packet is not actively injected in the LAN by the intrusion detection system. Rather, one or more broadcast/multicast/unicast packets from the data traffic on the LAN are used as marker packets. The logic being if an AP is connected to the same LAN as the sniffer, then at least the subset of the data traffic seen by the Ethernet port of the sniffer will be same as the data traffic captured by the sniffer on the radio channel. Thus the sniffer compares the packet captured on the radio channel with the packets transmitted over the wired LAN and captured by the sniffer's LAN connection port (Ethernet NIC) to identify a matching format.</p>
  <p num="p-0065">The sniffer can detect the appearance of the marker packet on a specific radio channel only if the sniffer is tuned to said radio channel during the interval of transmission of the marker packet on said radio channel. It may thus be necessary to send marker packets in the LAN periodically and preferably at randomized intervals, so as to maximize the probability that at least one sniffer gets an opportunity to detect at least one marker packet transmitted by each AP connected to the LAN. In a preferred embodiment, a sniffer originates a marker packet and the same sniffer monitors wireless medium to detect the transmission of the marker packet on the wireless medium from one or more APs.</p>
  <p num="p-0066">The logical flow of steps according to another embodiment of the LAN connectivity test is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims herein. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives. This embodiment is particularly useful to detect unauthorized APs that implement NAT (i.e., network address translation) functionality unlike layer <b>2</b> bridge functionality though it is also useful for the latter. The test is also useful to detect unauthorized layer <b>2</b> bridge type APs (e.g., soft APs) that block forwarding of broadcast packets from the wired LAN onto the wireless medium so as to evade detection by previous embodiment of the LAN connectivity test.</p>
  <p num="p-0067">In step <b>501</b>, the sniffer is tuned to the radio channel on which an AP operates. In step <b>502</b>, the sniffer establishes wireless connection with said AP. This typically involves listening to AP's beacon packet and subsequently performing “association” procedure with said AP as described in IEEE 802.11 standard. Subsequent to association, the parameters for IP connection are assigned to the radio interface of the sniffer. A preferred method to assign IP connection parameters is for the sniffer to perform DHCP (i.e., dynamic host configuration protocol) request/response transactions over the wireless connection established with AP. These parameters comprise at least of the IP address for the radio interface of the sniffer. The DHCP is described in RFC 2131 standard of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).</p>
  <p num="p-0068">In an alternate embodiment, in step <b>502</b> rather than establishing a new association with the AP, the sniffer reuses an existing association between the AP and a wireless station associated with the AP. For this, the sniffer detects the parameters of an existing association between the AP and the wireless station associated with the AP. The parameters include, among others, the MAC address of the associated wireless station. The sniffer may also determine the IP address and the TCP or UDP port number of the wireless station by monitoring the packets transmitted or received by the station.</p>
  <p num="p-0069">In step <b>503</b>, the sniffer sends one or more marker packets to the AP over the wireless connection newly established or already existing as applicable depending on the embodiment of step <b>502</b>. Preferably, the marker packet is addressed to the sniffer itself. Various preferred embodiments for this step are now described.</p>
  <p num="p-0070">In one embodiment of step <b>503</b>, the marker packet is UDP (i.e., user datagram protocol) packet. UDP is the transport layer protocol used by computers in the IP network to exchange data. It is described in RFC 768 standard of the IETF. In a preferred embodiment, UDP marker packet has source IP address as the IP address of the radio interface of the sniffer. In an alternative embodiment wherein step <b>502</b> reuses existing association, preferably the UDP marker packet has the source IP address and the source UDP port number same as the corresponding values detected in the packets transmitted by the wireless station whose association is being reused by the sniffer. The destination IP address in the UDP packet is the IP address of the wired (Ethernet) interface of the sniffer.</p>
  <p num="p-0071">In another embodiment of step <b>503</b>, the marker packet is a TCP (i.e., transmission control protocol) packet. The TCP is a transport protocol described in RFC 793 standard of the IETF. It is used by computers in IP network for reliable exchange of data. In a preferred embodiment, TCP marker packet is TCP SYN packet. In alternate embodiment, it can be any packet in TCP format. In a preferred embodiment, TCP marker packet has source IP address as the IP address of the radio interface of the sniffer. In an alternative embodiment wherein step <b>502</b> reuses existing association, preferably the TCP marker packet has the source IP address and the source TCP port number same as the corresponding values detected in the packets transmitted by the wireless station whose association is being reused by the sniffer. The destination IP address in the TCP packet is the IP address of the wired (e.g., Ethernet) interface of the sniffer.</p>
  <p num="p-0072">In yet another embodiment of step <b>503</b>, the marker packet is any layer <b>2</b> style frame. In a preferred embodiment, the source address in said layer <b>2</b> frame is the MAC address of the radio interface of the sniffer. In an alternative embodiment wherein step <b>502</b> reuses existing association, preferably the source address in the layer <b>2</b> frame is the MAC address of the wireless station whose association is being reused by the sniffer. The destination address in the layer <b>2</b> frame is the MAC address of the wired (e.g., Ethernet) interface of the sniffer.</p>
  <p num="p-0073">In yet another embodiment of step <b>503</b>, the marker packet is addressed to the broadcast address. If the sniffer detects that the IP address assigned to its radio interface is in the domain of addresses assigned to the wired LAN, the marker packet can be addressed to IP broadcast address in said domain of addresses. The IP broadcast address is constructed by using all binary ones in the host address part and using the network number of said wired LAN in the network address part of the IP address. Alternatively, layer <b>2</b> format marker packet can be addressed to the MAC broadcast address, which is hexadecimal ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff.</p>
  <p num="p-0074">If said AP is indeed connected to the LAN, it will forward marker packet from the wireless connection to the LAN and thus the marker packet will be received at the sniffer in step <b>504</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0075">Subsequently, said AP is declared to be connected to the LAN in step <b>505</b>. Alternatively, if the AP is not connected to the LAN, the marker packet will not be received at the sniffer and said AP is then declared unconnected to the LAN in step <b>506</b> according to a specific embodiment.</p>
  <p num="p-0076">The logical flow of steps according to another embodiment of the LAN connectivity test is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims herein. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives.</p>
  <p num="p-0077">For this, in step <b>601</b> the sniffer is tuned to a radio channel. The sniffer listens to the radio channel to detect the transmission of one or more “trigger” packets. In a specific embodiment, the trigger packets indicate the current state of ongoing communication between an AP and a wireless station. Knowing this enables preparing and sending marker packet so that it is almost indistinguishable from the packets constituting the ongoing communication between the AP and the wireless station. This makes it difficult for certain APs, for example compromised, software controlled or non-standard, to evade detection by marker packet test.</p>
  <p num="p-0078">When the transmission of one or more trigger packets is detected in step <b>602</b>, the identity of the AP that is the source or destination of the trigger packets is determined in step <b>603</b> from the transmitter address or the receiver address in the 802.11 MAC header of the trigger packets.</p>
  <p num="p-0079">Depending upon the type of trigger packets an optional step <b>604</b> is performed to determine if said AP is suspected to be not authorized (i.e. it can be unauthorized or external). For example an AP in the Active_AP_List that has not previously responded to any LAN connectivity test is suspected to be not authorized. Or, an AP whose behavior (contents of beacon frame, MAC address, authentication and encryption methods etc.) does not match the behavior known of the authorized APs is suspected to be not authorized.</p>
  <p num="p-0080">In step <b>605</b> one or more marker packets are constructed based on the type of trigger packets and information contained therein. The marker packets are transmitted in the LAN in step <b>606</b>. The sniffer continues to listen to the same radio channel to detect the transmission of at least one marker packet on the radio channel by said AP. If the marker packet transmission is detected before a timeout occurs, said AP is declared to be connected to the LAN. Alternatively, the AP is declared unconnected to the LAN according to a specific embodiment.</p>
  <p num="p-0081">In one embodiment of the LAN connectivity test using trigger packets, the trigger packets and the marker packets are transmission TCP packets. TCP is used by computers in Internet Protocol (IP) network for reliable exchange of data. TCP provides acknowledgement-based data delivery wherein lost pieces of data are recovered via retransmissions. The TCP also uses window-based congestion control algorithm so as to dynamically adapt to the available bandwidth between the communicating computers. A number of desirable Internet applications such as HTTP, file transfer, email, remote login, etc., are performed using TCP as transport protocol.</p>
  <p num="p-0082">Suppose the sniffer detects transmission of a TCP packet from a wireless station to the AP (called uplink direction) that is suspected to be not authorized. TCP packet is identified by examining the header fields of detected packet transmission. Specifically, for the TCP packet the value of “Type” field in 802.2 frame header is hexadecimal 0800 and the value of “Protocol” field in the IP header is hexadecimal 06. Then the marker packet is constructed as a TCP packet and in one embodiment the various fields in the marker packet (step <b>605</b> above) are set as follows:</p>
  <p num="p-0083">Swap the source and destination addresses in the Ethernet, IP and TCP headers of trigger packet to get source and destination addresses in the corresponding headers of marker packet.</p>
  <p num="p-0084">Set the TCP payload in marker packet such that it can later be identified by the intrusion detection. Let L denote the size of payload in number of octets.</p>
  <p num="p-0085">Let x1 denote the value of “sequence number” field in the TCP header of trigger packet and x2 denote the number of octets of TCP payload in the trigger packet. Then set “acknowledgement number” field in the TCP header of marker packet equal to (x1+x2).</p>
  <p num="p-0086">Let x3 denote the value of “acknowledgement number” field and x4 denote the value of “window” field in the TCP header of trigger packet. Then set the value of “sequence number” field in the TCP header of marker packet to a value that is between (x3−1) and (x3+x4−L).</p>
  <p num="p-0087">Other fields in the marker packet are set according to standard practice used by various implementations of corresponding protocols. Among these, values for some of the fields can be more judiciously chosen if the sniffer has also recently captured a TCP packet of the same flow transmitted by said AP to said wireless station (downlink). For example, the value of “window” field in the marker packet can be set equal to or close to the value of “window” field in the recently captured downlink TCP packet. Similarly, the value of “Identification” field in the IP header of marker packet can be set greater than the value of “Identification” field in the recently captured downlink TCP packet.</p>
  <p num="p-0088">Suppose that the sniffer detects downlink TCP packet. Then the marker packet is constructed as a TCP packet and in one embodiment the various fields in the marker packet (step <b>605</b> above) are set as follows:</p>
  <p num="p-0089">a. Swap source and destination addresses in the Ethernet, IP and TCP headers of trigger packet to get source and destination addresses in the corresponding headers of marker packet.</p>
  <p num="p-0090">b. Set the TCP payload in marker packet such that it can later be identified by the intrusion detection. Let L denote the size of payload in number of octets.</p>
  <p num="p-0091">c. Let x1 denote the value of “sequence number” field in the TCP header of trigger packet and x2 denote the number of octets of TCP payload in the trigger packet. Then set sequence number field in the TCP header of marker packet to a value greater than (x1+x2−1). If the sniffer has recently captured uplink TCP packet of the same flow and thus the intrusion detection has the knowledge of value of “window” field in recent uplink packet, the value of “sequence number” field in marker packet should be chosen so that it is also less than (x1+window−L+1).</p>
  <p num="p-0092">d. Other fields in the marker packet are set according to standard practice used by various implementations of corresponding protocols. Among these, values for some of the fields such as “window” field in TCP header and “Identification field in IP header can be more judiciously chosen if the sniffer has also recently captured uplink TCP packet of the same flow.</p>
  <p num="p-0093">In another embodiment of the LAN connectivity test using trigger packets, the trigger packet is DHCP request packet and the marker packet is DHCP response packet.</p>
  <p num="p-0094">In the preferred embodiment of the method of invention, in step <b>202</b> one or more feature criteria are used distinguish the APs in the Active_AP_List that are authorized by the network administrator from those that are not authorized. The latter include unauthorized and external APs. The method of invention works by inferring one or more features of an AP via analysis of the packets captured by the sniffer and comparing them with the features of the authorized APs. If the discrepancy is detected, said AP is deemed to be not authorized.</p>
  <p num="p-0095">A number of features of an AP can be inferred by analyzing one or more beacon packets transmitted by the AP. These features include but not limited to the vendor information (indicated by the first three bytes of the MAC address of the AP), the observed beacon interval and values of various fields (according to basic 802.11 and its enhancements including 802.11e, 802.11i, 802.11k and others) in the beacon packet such as beacon interval, SSID, capabilities information, radio parameters, various information elements (IEs) etc.</p>
  <p num="p-0096">Some other features of an AP can be inferred by analyzing the sequence of packets flowing between the AP and a wireless station. Most notably, the flow of authentication and association procedure (WEP, WPA, TKIP, RSN etc.) can be monitored by the sniffer to determine if it is consistent with that of an authorized AP.</p>
  <p num="p-0097">The feature set of authorized APs can be provided to the intrusion detection system by the network administrator. Alternatively, the intrusion detection system can learn the authorized feature set by detecting APs and their associated feature set in the operational network or laboratory environment. In the former case, the network administrator merely indicates to the intrusion detection system as to which of the detected APs are authorized APs.</p>
  <p num="p-0098">The sniffer may perform active probing to infer the features of an AP. For example, the sniffer attempts to establish a wireless connection with the AP which typically involves authentication and association procedure. The sniffer is provided with the credentials to be used during the authentication procedure. For example, the credentials include but not limited to password, digital certificate, security key, etc. If the sniffer succeeds in establishing the wireless connection with the AP, the AP may be declared as authorized. This test is even more effective for the authentication schemes, such as extensible authentication protocol transport layer security (EAP TLS), which perform mutual authentication. Depending upon the embodiment, the present invention can implement the various methods using certain systems, which are described in more detail below.</p>

In a specific embodiment, the identifying module determines the source AP of the wireless activity associated with the marker packet. In another specific embodiment, the receiving module, the processing module and the identifying module are provided within the sniffer device.</p>
  <p num="p-0102">Another alternative embodiment of the intrusion detection system is described below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In this embodiment, the detection, classification and prevention modules are provided within the sniffer device. The sniffer also provides and transfers a maker packet. The sniffer further receives the wireless activity associated with the marker packet, processes said activity to identify the marker packet and identifies the AP that transmits marker packet on the wireless medium. This embodiment in particularly advantageous because it allows deployment of standalone sniffer devices (e.g., as appliances).</p>
  <p num="p-0103">Accordingly, the sniffer appliance device comprises a CPU <b>901</b> adapted to executing computer codes and a memory <b>902</b> that stores computer codes and data.

The Ethernet NIC <b>905</b> is also provided that enables connecting the sniffer appliance device to the LAN via Ethernet jack <b>06</b> (e.g., RJ-45 socket). The Ethernet jack <b>906</b> may alternatively and additionally be used to connect the sniffer appliance to a PC for configuration purposes. Alternatively, a serial communication interface (e.g., RS-232) 912 is used to connect the sniffer appliance to a PC for configuration purposes. The various electronic components are connected together using data transfer bus <b>907</b>. The sniffer device can provide visual indication about detected wireless activity by means of one or more light bulbs or light emitting diodes <b>908</b> provided on the device panel <b>910</b>.
