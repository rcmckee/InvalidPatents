Each drawer is individually controlled, and generally includes a window and a plurality of sub-compartments with each sub-compartment accommodating an intravenous solution bag or other medical item. The drawers are each pivotable relative to the system housing to permit access to the sub-compartments, while the drawer windows enable the intravenous solution bags to be viewed during heating. A heating element is typically disposed beneath each drawer bottom wall to apply heat to walls of corresponding sub-compartments and evenly distribute heat to intravenous solution bags contained within those sub-compartments. Each drawer is associated with a controller that controls the heating element to apply heat to the corresponding drawer sub-compartments in accordance with a comparison between desired and measured temperatures associated with that drawer. Alternatively, the system may include a single common controller to control the heating element of each drawer based on the desired and measured temperatures associated with that drawer. The temperature control system may be mounted on a wall, intravenous (IV) pole, transportable cart or other suitable structure via a support mechanism. In addition, several temperature control systems may be mounted in a stacked or other arrangement on a transportable cart or other structure to provide heating capability for numerous medical items.</div>

    <heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading> <p>This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/104,635, entitled “Temperature Control System and Method for Heating and Maintaining Medical Items at Desired Temperatures”, filed Oct. 16, 1998, and from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/126,651, entitled “Temperature Control System and Method for Heating and Maintaining Medical Items at Desired Temperatures in Various Locations”, filed Mar. 29, 1999. The disclosures of the above-mentioned provisional applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>1. Technical Field</p>
    <p>The present invention pertains to systems for heating medical items. In particular, the present invention pertains to a system for heating and maintaining medical solution containers (e.g., bags or bottles containing saline or intravenous (IV) solutions, antibiotics or other drugs, blood, etc.) or other medical items (e.g., instruments, blankets, etc.) at desired temperatures.</p>
    <p>2. Discussion of Related Art</p>
    <p>Generally, various items are required to be heated prior to utilization in a medical procedure to prevent thermal shock and injury to a patient. These items typically include intravenous solution, surgical instruments, bottles and blankets. In order to provide the necessary heated items for use in medical procedures, medical personnel may utilize several types of warming systems to heat items toward their operational temperatures. For example, ovens may be disposed within operating rooms to heat items to desired temperatures. Further, U.S. Pat. No. 4,495,402 (Burdick et al) discloses a warmer for heating wet dressings and other articles disposed within a heating and storage compartment. The articles are arranged within the compartment in stacked relation and disposed on a plate that is supplied with thermal energy from a heater. The plate includes a center aperture whereby a first thermal sensor is disposed in the aperture in contact with a bottommost article. Control circuitry is disposed beneath the plate to control the heater to maintain temperature of the bottommost article at a desired level based on the temperatures sensed by the first thermal sensor and a second thermal sensor responsive to heater temperature.</p>
    <p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,408,576 (Bishop) discloses an intravenous fluid warmer having a cabinet structure to accommodate a plurality of intravenous fluid bags. A temperature sensor and pad of heating filaments are disposed within the cabinet structure, whereby the temperature sensor enables automatic temperature regulation of the pad of heating filaments to heat the intravenous fluid bags. The heating filaments are covered by a rubber layer to prevent melting of the bags during heating. A temperature indicator disposed on the cabinet structure permits a user to ascertain when a desired temperature is attained, whereby an intravenous fluid bag is removed from the intravenous fluid warmer via an opening defined in a side of the cabinet structure.</p>
    <p>The warming systems described above suffer from several disadvantages. In particular, ovens typically do not have a high degree of accuracy or control, thereby enabling use of items having temperatures incompatible with a medical procedure and possibly causing injury to a patient. Further, the Burdick et al and Bishop warmers employ heaters that generally contact a particular portion of an article being heated, thereby heating articles in an uneven manner and enabling formation of hot spots. Moreover, the Burdick et al and Bishop warming systems heat items simultaneously to only a single desired temperature, thereby being incompatible for applications requiring various items to be heated to different temperature ranges.</p>
    <p>The present invention overcomes the aforementioned problems and provides several advantages. For example, the present invention evenly distributes heat among intravenous solution bags or other medical items contained within system drawer sub-compartments, thereby avoiding creation of “hot spots” and “cold spots” and ensuring relatively uniform heating of the entire bag with enhanced temperature control. Further, each system drawer includes a window to enable viewing of the intravenous solution bags or other medical items during heating, while the system drawers facilitate easy access to the medical items within the system. In addition, the present invention incurs low operating costs, while providing versatility since the system drawers are each individually controlled to enable the system to heat intravenous solution bags or various other medical items to the same or different desired temperatures.</p>
    <heading>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to simultaneously maintain various items at different desired temperatures for use in medical procedures.</p>
    <p>It is another object of the present invention is to simultaneously maintain various items at different desired temperatures for use in medical procedures via a temperature control system including individually controlled drawers, whereby each drawer is maintained at an associated desired temperature.</p>
    <p>Yet another object of the present invention is to heat a medical item to a desired temperature by uniformly distributing heat about the medical item, thereby avoiding creation of “hot spots” and “cold spots”.</p>
    <p>Still another object of the present invention is to uniformly distribute heat about a medical item within a system drawer sub-compartment by conducting heat from a sub-compartment bottom wall along sub-compartment side walls.</p>
    <p>A further object of the present invention is to mount a temperature control system on a wall, intravenous (IV) pole, transportable cart or other support structure, via a support mechanism, to enable heating of medical items at various locations.</p>
    <p>Yet another object of the present invention is to mount a plurality of temperature control systems in stacked or other relation on a transportable cart or other support structure to enable heating of numerous medical items to desired temperatures at various locations.</p>
    <p>The aforesaid objects may be achieved individually and in combination, and it is not intended that the present invention be construed as requiring two or more of the objects to be combined unless expressly required by the claims attached hereto.</p>
    <p>According to the present invention, a temperature control system includes a cabinet or system housing having a plurality of drawers for containing intravenous solution bags or other medical items. Each drawer is individually controlled, and generally includes a window and a plurality of sub-compartments with each sub-compartment accommodating an intravenous solution bag or other medical item. The drawers are each pivotable relative to the system housing to permit access to the sub-compartments, while the drawer windows enable the intravenous solution bags to be viewed during heating. A heating element is typically disposed beneath each drawer bottom wall to apply heat to walls of corresponding sub-compartments and evenly distribute heat to intravenous solution bags contained within those sub-compartments. Each drawer is associated with a controller that controls the heating element to apply heat to the corresponding drawer sub-compartments in accordance with a comparison between desired and measured temperatures associated with that drawer. Alternatively, the system may include a single common controller to control the heating element of each drawer based on the desired and measured temperatures associated with that drawer. The temperature control system may be mounted on a wall, intravenous (IV) pole, transportable cart or other suitable structure via a support mechanism. In addition, several temperature control systems may be mounted in a stacked or other arrangement on a transportable cart or other structure to provide heating capability for numerous medical items.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p>A temperature control system for heating and maintaining medical solution containers (e.g., bags or bottles containing saline or intravenous (IV) solutions, antibiotics or other drugs, blood, etc.) or other medical items (e.g., instruments, blankets, etc.) at desired temperatures is illustrated in FIGS. 1-2. Specifically, temperature control system <b>2</b> <i>a </i>includes a cabinet or system housing <b>4</b> having substantially similar drawers <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, <b>6</b> <i>b </i>for enabling placement and removal of medical items, such as intravenous solution bags, within the system and corresponding controllers <b>22</b> for individually controlling heating of the drawers to maintain the bags at the same or different desired temperatures. Cabinet <b>4</b> is generally in the form of a rectangular box and includes top and bottom walls <b>10</b>, <b>12</b>, side walls <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> and front and rear walls <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. The cabinet walls are each substantially rectangular and collectively define a cabinet interior. Further, side wall <b>16</b> typically includes a series of labels <b>24</b>, such as fuse warning labels and labels providing other information, and a plurality of fuse holders <b>26</b> for receiving fuses of the system control circuitry described below. The cabinet is typically constructed of electro-galvanized steel (e.g., eighteen gauge) or other suitably sturdy material, and includes, by way of example only, a height of approximately twenty-five inches, a width of approximately fifteen inches and a depth of approximately six inches. However, the cabinet may be of any size or shape. It is to be understood that the terms “top”, “bottom”, “side”, “front”, “rear”, “horizontal”, “vertical”, “upper”, “lower”, “height”, “length”, “width”, “depth”, “forward” and the like are used herein merely to describe points of reference and do not limit the present invention to any specific orientation or configuration.</p>
    <p>Drawers <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, <b>6</b> <i>b </i>are generally disposed in vertical alignment in front wall <b>18</b> toward side wall <b>14</b>, while controllers <b>22</b> are each disposed in front wall <b>18</b> adjacent a corresponding drawer <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, <b>6</b> <i>b </i>and power switch <b>23</b> toward side wall <b>16</b>. Each controller <b>22</b> enables entry of a desired or set point temperature associated with a corresponding drawer and controls heating of intravenous solution bags residing within the corresponding drawer based on the associated desired temperature as described below. Each power switch <b>23</b> is generally disposed below a corresponding controller <b>22</b> and enables power to that controller for heating intravenous solution bags disposed within the corresponding drawer. By way of example only, cabinet <b>4</b> includes two each of drawers, associated power switches, controllers and accompanying control circuitry, however, any quantity (e.g., at least one) of drawers, power switches, controllers and control circuitry may be utilized, while the cabinet components may be arranged in any fashion.</p>
    <p>Drawers <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, <b>6</b> <i>b </i>each include a front wall or door <b>28</b>, a rear wall <b>30</b>, a bottom wall <b>32</b> and side walls <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>. The drawer walls are each substantially rectangular and collectively define a compartment or drawer interior having an open top portion for enabling placement and removal of intravenous solution bags within the drawers. By way of example only, the drawer rear, bottom and side walls define a drawer including a height of approximately eight and one-half inches, a width of approximately ten inches and a depth of approximately three and one-half inches. However, the drawers may be of any size or shape, and the system may include any combination of drawers of different or substantially similar types.</p>
    <p>Door <b>28</b> includes a handle <b>38</b> typically disposed toward the door upper portion, whereby the handle may be implemented by any conventional or other type of handle. Alternatively, the handle may be disposed on the door at any suitable location. Door <b>28</b> generally enables a corresponding drawer to pivot into and out of the cabinet as described below, and is typically constructed of electro-galvanized steel (e.g., sixteen gauge) or other suitably sturdy material. The door further includes a substantially rectangular opening <b>40</b> covered by a substantially transparent material <b>42</b>, such as glass or plexiglass, to serve as a window to enable viewing of the intravenous solution bags and maintain heat within the cabinet. By way of example only, door <b>28</b> includes a height of approximately eleven and one-half inches, and a width of approximately fourteen and one-half inches, however, the door, opening and transparent material may be of any size or shape.</p>
    <p>Divider walls <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> are disposed within each drawer interior to partition that interior into sub-compartments or bins <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b</i>, <b>52</b> <i>c</i>. In particular, divider walls <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> extend from rear wall <b>30</b> substantially in parallel to, and include dimensions substantially the same as, side walls <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>. The front and rear edges of dividers <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> are bent at an angle of approximately ninety degrees relative to the respective divider wall body portions, and extend transversely toward side wall <b>34</b> to form ledges <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, respectively. Similarly, the front edges of side walls <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> are bent at an angle of approximately ninety degrees relative to the respective side wall body portions, and extend transversely toward each other to form ledges <b>49</b>, <b>51</b>, respectively. Further, the front edge of bottom wall <b>32</b> is bent at an angle of approximately ninety degrees relative to the bottom wall body portion, and extends upward toward a drawer upper potion to form ledge <b>53</b>. Ledges <b>50</b> enable the divider walls to interface rear wall <b>30</b>, while ledges <b>48</b> include a recess or gap to permit the divider walls to engage and secure transparent material <b>42</b> within opening <b>40</b> of door <b>28</b>. Moreover, ledges <b>48</b>, <b>49</b>, <b>51</b> and <b>53</b> enable the door to interface the drawer side, bottom and divider walls. Each drawer sub-compartment is typically configured to accommodate a single intravenous solution bag, and is defined by the drawer rear, bottom, side and divider walls. Specifically, sub-compartment <b>52</b> <i>a </i>is defined between side wall <b>34</b> and divider wall <b>44</b>, sub-compartment <b>52</b> <i>b </i>is defined between divider walls <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> and sub-compartment <b>52</b> <i>c </i>is defined between divider wall <b>46</b> and side wall <b>36</b>. The drawer side, rear, bottom and divider walls are typically constructed of copper or other suitable heat conducting material to conduct and evenly distribute heat to the intravenous solution bags disposed within the drawer as described below.</p>
    <p>A heating element or pad <b>54</b> is typically disposed on the underside of each drawer bottom wall <b>32</b>, whereby the heat applied by the heating pad is conducted by the drawer bottom, side, rear and divider walls to provide an even heat distribution to the intravenous solution bags residing in the sub-compartments of that drawer. In other words, each individual drawer sub-compartment includes bottom, side and rear walls that conduct and directly transmit heat from the heating pad to the intravenous solution bag contained in that sub-compartment, thereby preventing other intravenous solution bags residing in the cabinet from being affected by the applied heat. The application of heat from the sub-compartment walls provides a relatively uniform heat distribution and prevents the occurrence of certain intravenous solution bags (e.g., bags disposed near the heat source) attaining higher temperatures than the remaining bags (e.g., bags disposed at other locations within the cabinet) as is typically present in common single heat source systems. Alternatively, the heating pad may be disposed on the side or rear walls of each drawer.</p>
    <p>The heating pad is preferably configured to cover only a portion of a drawer bottom wall, but may include any type of configuration (e.g., strips, bars, segments, include various openings, etc.). A temperature sensor <b>56</b> is typically disposed on the underside of each drawer bottom wall <b>32</b> generally within the confines of the corresponding heating pad (e.g., the portion of the heating pad not covering the drawer bottom wall). The temperature sensor is preferably implemented by a conventional RTD temperature sensor and measures the temperature of the bottom wall of the corresponding drawer. However, the temperature sensor may be implemented by any conventional or other type of temperature sensor, and may be disposed at any suitable location on or within a drawer. The temperature measurement of sensor <b>56</b> is provided to the controller associated with the drawer for control of the corresponding heating pad as described below.</p>
    <p>An exemplary heating pad of the type employed by the temperature control system is illustrated in FIG. <b>3</b>. Specifically, heating pad <b>54</b> is substantially rectangular and includes a substantially rectangular opening <b>58</b>. By way of example only, heating pad <b>54</b> includes a width or shorter dimension of approximately three inches and length or longer dimension of approximately ten inches, while opening <b>58</b> includes a width of approximately one inch and a length of approximately eight inches. A connector <b>60</b> is disposed along a heating pad shorter dimension edge to facilitate connections for the heating pad. The heating pad is preferably implemented by a conventional etched foil silicon rubber heater (e.g., 44 watts, 120 VAC) having an extra layer of silicon rubber on the adhesive side. The heating pad further includes a pressure sensitive adhesive for attachment to a drawer bottom wall. Temperature sensor <b>56</b> is typically disposed within opening <b>58</b> (FIG. 2) to measure the temperature of a corresponding drawer bottom wall as described above. The heating pad may be of any quantity (e.g., at least one), shape, or size, and may include any configuration that covers the entirety or a portion of a corresponding drawer bottom wall. In addition, the heating element or pad may be implemented by any conventional or other type of heater or heating element (e.g., heating coils) to heat the drawers.</p>
    <p>Referring back to FIGS. 1-2, side walls <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> of drawers <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, <b>6</b> <i>b </i>interface respective doors <b>28</b> via posts <b>62</b> to secure the drawers to the doors. Each door <b>28</b> further includes a pivoting mechanism having a pivot hinge <b>63</b> (FIG. 8) and a locking hinge <b>64</b> to enable a corresponding drawer to angle forward and pivot outward from the cabinet interior into an open position. In particular, locking hinge <b>64</b> includes a receptacle <b>66</b> disposed on a corresponding door <b>28</b>, a curved track or slide <b>68</b> and a pin or bolt disposed within the cabinet interior (not shown). Receptacle <b>66</b> is disposed toward an intermediate portion of the corresponding door and extends from that door interior surface toward the cabinet interior. The receptacle includes an opening through which a pin or bolt <b>70</b> is inserted to connect a proximal end of slide <b>68</b> to the corresponding door.</p>
    <p>Curved slide <b>68</b> typically extends from receptacle <b>66</b> of the corresponding door into the cabinet interior and curves toward cabinet bottom wall <b>12</b>. The slide includes an opening <b>72</b> extending along the slide from the receptacle into the cabinet interior, whereby an associated cabinet interior bolt is disposed within and through the opening to enable the corresponding drawer to pivot out of and into the cabinet interior to open and closed positions, respectively. The distal end of the slide, in combination with the associated cabinet interior bolt, serves as a stop to limit pivoting or the forward angle of the corresponding drawer. Locking hinge <b>64</b> may be disposed adjacent either side wall <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> of the corresponding drawer, or a door may include dual pivoting mechanisms, whereby a mechanism is disposed adjacent each corresponding drawer side wall. An operator typically grasps handle <b>38</b> of a corresponding door and applies force to draw that handle forward, thereby forcing slide <b>68</b> of that door forward, while the associated cabinet interior bolt traverses corresponding slide opening <b>72</b>. When sufficient force is applied to the handle, the distal end of the corresponding slide opening is caused to engage the associated cabinet interior bolt to prevent further pivoting of a corresponding drawer. Conversely, force may be applied to the handle to facilitate pivoting of the corresponding drawer toward the cabinet to a closed position, whereby the corresponding slide is forced into the cabinet interior, while the associated cabinet interior bolt traverses corresponding slide opening <b>72</b>.</p>
    <p>Controllers <b>22</b> each typically include a display <b>74</b> (e.g., LED or LCD) and a plurality of input devices or buttons <b>76</b> for enabling entry of a desired or set point temperature for a corresponding drawer. Input devices <b>76</b> are manipulated to enable entry of the desired temperature, while each display <b>74</b> may alternatively indicate the actual temperature measured by a corresponding temperature sensor <b>56</b> (FIG. 2) or the desired or set point temperature entered by the operator. Display <b>74</b> typically displays the measured temperature, and may be directed, via the input devices, to display the set point temperature.</p>
    <p>The controllers each essentially implement a feedback control loop to control heating of the corresponding drawers. Specifically, each controller <b>22</b> receives a temperature signal from a corresponding temperature sensor <b>56</b> indicating the temperature of the corresponding drawer bottom wall. In response to the measured temperature of a corresponding drawer bottom wall being equal to or exceeding the desired temperature associated with that drawer, the corresponding controller disables power to the associated heating element via a solid state relay described below. Conversely, when the measured temperature of the corresponding drawer bottom wall is below the desired temperature associated with that drawer, the corresponding controller enables power to the associated heating element via the solid state relay. Each controller is preferably implemented by a Eurotherm Controls Model 2132 Controller that is generally pre-programmed with a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control algorithm to control the corresponding heating element based on the measured temperature of the corresponding drawer. However, the controllers may be implemented by any conventional or other processor or circuitry utilizing any control algorithm to control the heating elements.</p>
    <p>An exemplary control circuit of the temperature control system is illustrated in FIG. <b>4</b>. Specifically, system control circuit <b>77</b> includes control circuits <b>78</b> <i>a</i>, <b>78</b> <i>b </i>to control heating of corresponding drawers <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, <b>6</b> <i>b</i>, respectively. The control circuits are disposed between power conductors <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> to enable power to the circuits. Conductor <b>80</b> typically supplies a positive potential, while conductor <b>82</b> provides a negative or reference potential. A fuse <b>84</b>, preferably a conventional three Amp fuse, is connected in series with conductor <b>80</b> and the control circuits to prevent surges from damaging the circuitry. Control circuit <b>78</b> <i>a </i>includes conventional power switch <b>23</b>, controller <b>22</b>, temperature sensor <b>56</b>, a conventional solid state relay <b>88</b>, a conventional temperature cut out switch <b>92</b>, heating element or pad <b>54</b> and conventional fuses <b>86</b>, <b>90</b>. In particular, power switch <b>23</b> is connected to conductor <b>80</b>, while fuse <b>86</b>, typically a two Amp fuse, is connected between the power switch and conductor <b>80</b> to prevent damage to the power switch. The power switch is further connected to conductor <b>82</b> and controller <b>22</b> to enable power to the controller.</p>
    <p>Controller <b>22</b> receives power from power switch <b>23</b> and is further connected to temperature sensor <b>56</b>, solid state relay <b>88</b> and heating pad <b>54</b>. The temperature sensor measures a corresponding drawer bottom wall temperature and transmits a signal to controller <b>22</b> indicating that temperature. The controller controls solid state relay <b>88</b> to enable or disable power to heating pad <b>54</b> based on the measured temperature as described above. The solid state relay is connected to conductor <b>80</b> and heating pad <b>54</b>, while fuse <b>90</b>, typically a 0.5 Amp fuse, is connected between the relay and conductor <b>80</b> to prevent damage to the relay. Moreover, temperature cut-out switch <b>92</b> is connected between the relay and heating pad to disable the heating pad in response to detecting a heating pad temperature in excess of a predetermined threshold. Control circuit <b>78</b> <i>a </i>may be implemented by any conventional circuitry components performing the above-described functions. Control circuit <b>78</b> <i>b </i>is connected in parallel with and is substantially similar to control circuit <b>78</b> <i>a </i>described above to control heating of drawer <b>6</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
    <p>Operation of the temperature control system is described with reference to FIGS. 1-4. Initially, an operator selects intravenous solution bags (e.g., containing intravenous solution) or other medical items for heating within the cabinet and determines appropriate temperatures for the items. The operator subsequently selects a drawer <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, <b>6</b> <i>b </i>and enables a corresponding power switch <b>23</b>, whereby the operator grasps and applies force to handle <b>38</b> of the selected drawer to pivot that drawer outward from the cabinet interior to an open position. Intravenous solution bags are disposed within any quantity (e.g., at least one) or combination of corresponding drawer sub-compartments <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b</i>, <b>52</b> <i>c </i>such that any one sub-compartment contains a single intravenous solution bag. The selected drawer is subsequently pivoted into the cabinet interior to a closed position. The desired temperature is entered into corresponding controller <b>22</b> via input devices or buttons <b>76</b>. The controller receives signals from corresponding temperature sensor <b>56</b> (FIG. 2) and determines appropriate controls for solid state relay <b>88</b> (FIG. 4) to enable or disable power to associated heating pad <b>54</b> as described above. The heating pad applies heat to the corresponding drawer bottom wall, whereby the drawer rear, side and divider walls conduct heat from the bottom wall to evenly distribute heat to the intravenous solution bags residing within the corresponding drawer sub-compartments as described above.</p>
    <p>Controller <b>22</b> displays on display <b>74</b> the corresponding drawer bottom wall temperature measured by temperature sensor <b>56</b>, and may be directed to alternatively display the desired temperature based on manipulation of input devices <b>76</b>. Further, the intravenous solution bags may be viewed through transparent material <b>42</b> during heating. When the intravenous solution bags have attained the desired temperature, the selected drawer is pivoted to an open position as described above, whereby the heated bags are removed from sub-compartments of the selected drawer for use, while that drawer is subsequently returned to a closed position. Further, additional intravenous solution bags may replace the removed heated bags within those sub-compartments for heating by the system. It is to be understood that either or both of the drawers may be used and independently controlled in substantially the same manner described above to maintain items at the same or different desired temperatures. Further, any quantity of intravenous solution bags or items may be disposed within the sub-compartments and drawers for heating by the cabinet.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, the system may include a single common controller to provide independent control of each drawer as illustrated in FIG. <b>5</b>. System <b>2</b> <i>b </i>is substantially similar to system <b>2</b> <i>a </i>described above except that system <b>2</b> <i>b </i>includes a single controller <b>29</b> for controlling each drawer and a common power switch <b>27</b> to enable power to the system. Controller <b>29</b> and power switch <b>27</b> are typically disposed on front wall <b>18</b> adjacent drawer <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, but may be disposed at any suitable locations on the cabinet. The common power switch is substantially similar to power switches <b>23</b> described above, while controller <b>29</b> typically includes a display <b>74</b> (e.g., LED or LCD) and a plurality of input devices or buttons <b>76</b> for enabling entry of desired or set point temperatures for the corresponding drawers. The input devices are manipulated to enable entry of the desired temperatures, while display <b>74</b> may indicate the actual temperature of each drawer bottom wall measured by a corresponding temperature sensor <b>56</b> (FIG. 2) or the desired or set point temperatures entered by the operator. Display <b>74</b> typically displays the measured temperature of each drawer, and may be directed, via the input devices, to display the set point temperatures.</p>
    <p>Controller <b>29</b> provides independent control for each drawer and essentially implements a feedback control loop to control heating of those drawers. Specifically, controller <b>29</b> includes inputs for receiving temperature signals from temperature sensor <b>56</b> of each drawer indicating the temperature of a corresponding drawer bottom wall. In response to the measured temperature of a drawer bottom wall being equal to or exceeding the desired temperature entered for a corresponding drawer, the controller disables power to the heating element associated with that drawer via a solid state relay as described below. Conversely, when the measured temperature of the drawer bottom wall is below the desired temperature entered for the corresponding drawer, the controller enables power to the heating element associated with that drawer via the solid state relay. The controller is generally pre-programmed with a fuzzy logic or other type of control algorithm to control each drawer based on the measured temperature of the corresponding drawer bottom wall.</p>
    <p>Controller <b>29</b> is preferably implemented by a 32A Series Temperature/Process Controller manufactured by Love Controls, a Division of Dwyer Instruments, Inc. Generally, this type of controller provides single set point capability for a process, or dual set point capability (e.g., dependent high and low set points) for the same process, and displays the set point and actual or process temperatures. However, in order to employ this type of controller within the present invention, the 32A Series Controller has been slightly modified. In particular, the alarm relay and associated circuits of the 32A Series Controller have been removed to permit insertion of loop circuitry, thereby enabling independent operation of plural set points. Further, the 32A Series Controller has been modified to display the actual temperature of each drawer bottom wall, while the set point temperatures entered for the drawers may be displayed by manipulating input devices <b>76</b>. In addition, the options typically available for the 32A Series Controller have not been enabled. It is to be understood that the controllers of the present invention may each be implemented by any quantity of conventional or other processors or circuitry utilizing any control algorithm to control the drawers, whereby the processors or circuitry may accommodate any quantity of heaters, drawers or set points.</p>
    <p>An exemplary control circuit for system <b>2</b> <i>b </i>is substantially similar to the circuit described above for FIG. 4 except that power switches <b>23</b> and associated fuses <b>86</b> are replaced by a single common power switch <b>27</b> (FIG. 5) and an associated fuse, and controllers <b>22</b> are replaced by a single controller <b>29</b>. Specifically, power switch enables power to each drawer and the controller from power conductors <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> (FIG. 4) in substantially the same manner described above for power switches <b>23</b>. A fuse, similar to fuse <b>86</b> described above, is connected between the positive potential power conductor and power switch <b>27</b> to prevent damage to the power switch. Controller <b>29</b> is connected to power switch <b>27</b> and the temperature sensor, heater, and solid state relay associated with each drawer. The controller receives temperature signals from the temperature sensor of each drawer and controls the heating element associated with that drawer, via a corresponding solid state relay, in substantially the same manner described above based on the measured temperature of the corresponding drawer.</p>
    <p>The temperature control systems described above may be mounted on a wall or various other structures via a support mechanism as illustrated in FIG. <b>6</b>. Specifically, a support mechanism <b>180</b> includes a base <b>182</b> and an engagement member <b>184</b>. Base <b>182</b> is substantially rectangular and includes a series of holes <b>186</b> (e.g., preferably four) arranged in a box-like configuration, whereby a hole <b>186</b> is defined in the base toward the upper and lower portions of each base side edge. The holes receive bolts or screws <b>187</b> to mount the support mechanism on a wall <b>188</b> or other structure. Engagement member <b>184</b> is typically formed integral with and extends forwardly from the base. In the preferred embodiment, engagement member <b>184</b> has a generally rectangular configuration with truncated upper corners and an arcuate lower portion <b>185</b> by which member <b>184</b> is joined to the base. In particular, the arcuate lower portion extends slightly downward from the base bottom edge and subsequently curves to an upward direction to enable the engagement member upper portion to be spaced from the base by a slight distance and to extend from the curved lower portion substantially parallel to the base. The engagement member dimensions are preferably less than the base dimensions such that the 719 engagement member partially overlies the base central portion residing between holes <b>186</b> defined toward the base side edges. The engagement member, in combination with the base, essentially forms a hook-type device for engaging a temperature control system.</p>
    <p>A bracket <b>124</b> is disposed on a temperature control system <b>2</b> <i>a</i>, <b>2</b> <i>b </i>to interface support mechanism <b>180</b>. In particular, bracket <b>124</b> includes a base <b>130</b>, exposed wall <b>132</b>, top wall <b>134</b> and side walls <b>136</b>, <b>138</b>. Base <b>130</b> is preferably welded or otherwise secured to a temperature control system <b>2</b> <i>a</i>, <b>2</b> <i>b </i>toward the intermediate portion of cabinet rear wall <b>20</b>, while exposed wall <b>132</b> projects substantially parallel to and is separated by a slight distance from the bracket base. The bracket base dimensions are preferably greater than the dimensions of the exposed wall such that the exposed wall generally covers the bracket base upper portion. The bracket top and side walls interconnect the bracket base and exposed wall, thereby forming a bracket compartment having an open bottom portion. The bracket compartment dimensions are slightly greater than the dimensions of engagement member <b>184</b> such that the engagement member upper portion is received within the bracket compartment. Temperature control system <b>2</b> <i>a</i>, <b>2</b> <i>b </i>may be placed on wall <b>188</b>, whereby engagement member <b>184</b> is inserted into the bracket compartment to suspend that temperature control system from the wall.

    <p>Temperature control systems <b>2</b> <i>a</i>, <b>2</b> <i>b </i>may be further mounted on an intravenous (IV) pole as illustrated in FIG. <b>7</b>. Specifically, support mechanism <b>180</b> may be attached to an intravenous (IV) pole <b>100</b> via a support frame <b>102</b> to enable temperature control system <b>2</b> <i>a</i>, <b>2</b> <i>b </i>to be suspended from that pole. The support frame includes a base plate <b>104</b> and a mounting plate <b>106</b>. The base and mounting plates are each substantially rectangular and include respective arcuate channels <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> defined in the respective interior plate surfaces for interfacing pole <b>100</b>. Mounting plate <b>106</b> includes a series of holes <b>108</b> (e.g., preferably four) arranged in a box-like configuration, whereby a hole <b>108</b> is defined in the mounting plate toward the upper and lower portions of each mounting plate side edge.

Threaded bolts <b>112</b> (e.g., preferably four) are inserted through corresponding mounting plate and support mechanism holes <b>108</b>, <b>186</b> while a plurality of washers <b>118</b> (e.g., preferably four) are disposed on a corresponding bolt <b>112</b> proximate the mounting plate interior surface. A series of substantially annular nuts <b>120</b> (e.g., preferably four) are internally threaded to engage the threads of respective bolts <b>112</b>. Nuts <b>120</b> each engage a corresponding bolt <b>112</b> to secure the support mechanism to mounting plate <b>106</b>.</p>
    <p>Base plate <b>104</b> has a height similar to, and a width less than the corresponding dimensions of mounting plate <b>106</b>, and has a series of holes <b>116</b> (e.g., preferably four) arranged in a box-like configuration, whereby a hole <b>116</b> is defined in the base plate toward the upper and lower portions of each base plate side edge. Holes <b>116</b> enable base plate <b>104</b> to be secured to mounting plate <b>106</b>, whereby the mounting plate further includes a set of corresponding holes <b>110</b> (e.g., preferably four). Holes <b>110</b> are similarly arranged in a box-like configuration, whereby a hole <b>110</b> is defined in the mounting plate toward the portions residing between each hole <b>108</b> and channel <b>128</b>. Holes <b>110</b> are each internally threaded for engaging fastening devices, such as screws or bolts. Base and mounting plates <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> are placed about pole <b>100</b> such that the pole is positioned between the plates and within plate channels <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>, while holes <b>116</b> of base plate <b>104</b> are disposed coincident holes <b>110</b> of mounting plate <b>106</b>. Threaded bolts <b>114</b> (e.g., preferably four) are inserted through corresponding washers <b>122</b> (e.g., preferably four) and associated base and mounting plate holes <b>116</b>, <b>110</b>. Bolts <b>114</b> each are threaded to engage the threads of holes <b>110</b>, whereby the bolts secure base plate <b>104</b> to mounting plate <b>106</b>. The interconnected base and mounting plates engage pole <b>100</b>, thereby securing support mechanism <b>180</b> to the pole and enabling the support mechanism to suspend temperature control system <b>2</b> <i>a</i>, <b>2</b> <i>b </i>via bracket <b>124</b> as described above.</p>
