For example, when the mobile communication terminal <b>100</b> is in a phone call mode, the display unit <b>151</b> may display a User Interface (UI) or a Graphic User Interface (GUI) associated with a call. When the mobile communication terminal <b>100</b> is in a video call mode or image capturing mode, the display unit <b>151</b> may display a captured image and/or received image, a UI or GUI.</p>
    <p num="p-0062">The display unit <b>151</b> may include at least one of a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), a Thin Film Transistor-LCD (TFT-LCD), an Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) display, a flexible display, a three-dimensional (3D) display.</p>
    <p num="p-0063">Some of those displays may be configured with a transparent or optical transparent type to allow viewing of the exterior through the display unit, which may be called transparent displays. An example of the typical transparent displays may include a transparent LCD (TOLED), and the like. Under this configuration, a user can view an object positioned at a rear side of a terminal body through a region occupied by the display unit <b>151</b> of the terminal body.</p>
    <p num="p-0064">The display unit <b>151</b> may be implemented in two or more in number according to a configured aspect of the portable terminal <b>100</b>. For instance, a plurality of the display units <b>151</b> may be arranged on one surface to be spaced apart from or integrated with each other, or may be arranged on different surfaces.</p>
    <p num="p-0065">Here, if the display unit <b>151</b> and a touch sensitive sensor (referred to as a touch sensor) have an interlayer structure, the structure may be referred to as a touch screen. The display unit <b>151</b> may be used as an input device rather than an output device. The touch sensor may be implemented as a touch film, a touch sheet, a touch pad, and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0066">The touch sensor may be configured to convert changes of a pressure applied to a specific part of the display unit <b>151</b>, or a capacitance occurring from a specific part of the display unit <b>151</b>, into electric input signals. Also, the touch sensor may be configured to sense not only a touched position and a touched area, but also a touch pressure.</p>
    <p num="p-0067">When touch inputs are sensed by the touch sensors, corresponding signals are transmitted to a touch controller (not shown). The touch controller processes the received signals, and then transmits corresponding data to the controller <b>180</b>. Accordingly, the controller <b>180</b> may sense which region of the display unit <b>151</b> has been touched.</p>
    <p num="p-0068">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a proximity sensor <b>141</b> may be arranged at an inner region of the portable terminal <b>100</b> covered by the touch screen, or near the touch screen. The proximity sensor indicates a sensor to sense presence or absence of an object approaching to a surface to be sensed, or an object disposed near a surface to be sensed, by using an electromagnetic field or infrared rays without a mechanical contact. The proximity sensor has a longer lifespan and a more enhanced utility than a contact sensor.</p>
    <p num="p-0069">The proximity sensor may include an optical transmission type photoelectric sensor, a direct reflective type photoelectric sensor, a mirror reflective type photoelectric sensor, a high-frequency oscillation proximity sensor, a capacitance type proximity sensor, a magnetic type proximity sensor, an infrared rays proximity sensor, and so on. When the touch screen is implemented as a capacitance type, proximity of a pointer to the touch screen is sensed by changes of an electromagnetic field. In this case, the touch screen (touch sensor) may be categorized into a proximity sensor.</p>
    <p num="p-0070">Hereinafter, for the sake of convenience of brief explanation, a status that the pointer is positioned to be proximate onto the touch screen without contact will be referred to as ‘proximity touch’, whereas a status that the pointer substantially comes in contact with the touch screen will be referred to as ‘contact touch’. For the position corresponding to the proximity touch of the pointer on the touch screen, such position corresponds to a position where the pointer faces perpendicular to the touch screen upon the proximity touch of the pointer.</p>
    <p num="p-0071">The proximity sensor senses proximity touch, and proximity touch patterns (e.g., proximity touch distance, proximity touch direction, proximity touch speed, time, proximity touch position, proximity touch moving status, etc.). Information relating to the sensed proximity touch and the sensed proximity touch patterns may be output onto the touch screen.</p>
    <p num="p-0072">The audio output module <b>152</b> may output audio data received from the wireless communication unit <b>110</b> or stored in the memory <b>160</b>, in a call-receiving mode, a call-placing mode, a recording mode, a voice recognition mode, a broadcast reception mode, and so on. The audio output module <b>152</b> may output audio signals relating to functions performed in the portable terminal <b>100</b>, e.g., sound alarming a call received or a message received, and so on. The audio output module <b>152</b> may include a receiver, a speaker, a buzzer, and so on.</p>
    <p num="p-0073">The alarm <b>153</b> outputs signals notifying occurrence of events from the portable terminal <b>100</b>. The events occurring from the portable terminal <b>100</b> may include call received, message received, key signal input, touch input, and so on. The alarm <b>153</b> may output not only video or audio signals, but also other types of signals such as signals notifying occurrence of events in a vibration manner. Since the video or audio signals can be output through the display unit <b>151</b> or the audio output unit <b>152</b>, the display unit <b>151</b> and the audio output module <b>152</b> may be categorized into a part of the alarm <b>153</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0074">The haptic module <b>154</b> generates various tactile effects which a user can feel. A representative example of the tactile effects generated by the haptic module <b>154</b> includes vibration. Vibration generated by the haptic module <b>154</b> may have a controllable intensity, a controllable pattern, and so on. For instance, different vibration may be output in a synthesized manner or in a sequential manner.</p>
    <p num="p-0075">The haptic module <b>154</b> may generate various tactile effects, including not only vibration, but also arrangement of pins vertically moving with respect to a skin being touched, air injection force or air suction force through an injection hole or a suction hole, touch by a skin surface, presence or absence of contact with an electrode, effects by stimulus such as an electrostatic force, reproduction of cold or hot feeling using a heat absorbing device or a heat emitting device, and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0076">The haptic module <b>154</b> may be configured to transmit tactile effects through a user's direct contact, or a user's muscular sense using a finger or a hand.

Also, the memory <b>160</b> may store data related to various patterns of vibrations and sounds outputted upon the touch input on the touch screen.</p>
    <p num="p-0078">The memory <b>160</b> may be implemented using any type of suitable storage medium including a flash memory type, a hard disk type, a multimedia card micro type, a memory card type (e.g., SD or DX memory), Random Access Memory (RAM), Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), Read-Only Memory (ROM), Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-only Memory (EEPROM), Programmable Read-only Memory (PROM), magnetic memory, magnetic disk, optical disk, and the like. Also, the mobile communication terminal <b>100</b> may operate a web storage which performs the storage function of the memory <b>160</b> on the Internet.</p>
    <p num="p-0079">The interface unit <b>170</b> may generally be implemented to interface the portable terminal with external devices. The interface unit <b>170</b> may allow a data reception from an external device, a power delivery to each component in the portable terminal <b>100</b>, or a data transmission from the portable terminal <b>100</b> to an external device. The interface unit <b>170</b> may include, for example, wired/wireless headset ports, external charger ports, wired/wireless data ports, memory card ports, ports for coupling devices having an identification module, audio Input/Output (I/O) ports, video I/O ports, earphone ports, and the like. The identification module may be configured as a chip for storing various information required to authenticate an authority to use the portable terminal <b>100</b>, which may include a User Identity Module (UIM), a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM), and the like. Also, the device having the identification module (hereinafter, referred to as ‘identification device’) may be implemented in a type of smart card. Hence, the identification device can be coupled to the portable terminal <b>100</b> via a port.</p>
    <p num="p-0080">Also, the interface unit may serve as a path for power to be supplied from an external cradle to the portable terminal <b>100</b> when the portable terminal <b>100</b> is connected to the external cradle or as a path for transferring various command signals inputted from the cradle by a user to the portable terminal <b>100</b>. Such various command signals or power inputted from the cradle may operate as signals for recognizing that the portable terminal <b>100</b> has accurately been mounted to the cradle.</p>
    <p num="p-0081">The controller <b>180</b> typically controls the overall operations of the portable terminal <b>100</b>.

    <p num="p-0085">On the other hand, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the sensing unit <b>140</b> may include at least one sensor for detecting the user's gaze information. The at least one sensor may include at least one acceleration sensor for detecting tilt of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. The acceleration sensor may measure the acceleration of gravity for earth's gravity to measure a degree of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> being inclined to the surface of the earth. The acceleration sensor may detect an inclined degree of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> against a single axis (x, y, or z-axis) or multiple axes (at least two axes among x, y, and z).</p>
    <p num="p-0086">Furthermore/otherwise, the at least one sensor may include at least one touch sensor for detecting a grip type of the mobile terminal. The at least one touch sensor may be a lateral surface touch sensor, and the lateral surface touch sensor may be provided at a left/right lateral surface of the mobile terminal or both lateral surfaces thereof. Each lateral surface touch sensor may include a plurality of cells for recognizing one touch as an input, and the plurality of cells may be arranged in a grid form. If the user's finger is touched to some cells of the plurality of cells through a lateral surface touch, then the user's grip type may be determined by a combination of some cells touched with the user's finger.</p>
    <p num="p-0087">Furthermore, at least one sensor may include at least one optical sensor for capturing a user's face. The optical sensor may be located at the same surface as the surface provided with the display unit <b>151</b> to capture the user. In this case, a user's face region may be detected from an image in which the user has been captured.

    <p num="p-0088">Various embodiments described herein may be implemented in a computer or similar device readable medium using software, hardware, or any combination thereof.</p>

In some cases, such embodiments may be implemented in the controller <b>180</b> itself.</p>
    <p num="p-0090">For software implementation, the embodiments such as procedures or functions may be implemented together with separate software modules that allow performing of at least one function or operation. Software codes can be implemented by a software application written in any suitable programming language. The software codes may be stored in the memory <b>160</b> and executed by the controller <b>180</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0091"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a detailed block diagram illustrating a screen lock module <b>200</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0092">The screen lock module <b>200</b> according to the embodiments of the present disclosure may include an execution controller <b>210</b> and a change controller <b>220</b>. If a user input is not received through the user input unit <b>130</b> for a preset time (delay time), then the execution controller <b>210</b> may execute screen lock. For example, when the user of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> does not apply a user input for a delay time through the user input unit <b>130</b>, the execution controller <b>210</b> may execute screen lock. In this case, the mobile terminal <b>100</b> enters a screen lock mode, and the user may apply a preset input in the screen lock mode to get out of the screen lock mode.</p>
    <p num="p-0093">The change controller <b>220</b> according to a first embodiment of the present disclosure may change a delay time based on a type of application. Here, the type of application may mean an attribute of the application divided according to a function provided by the application. According to an embodiment, the type of application may be divided according to the kinds of data being approached, used or inputted in the application, such as content-based, messaging service-based, search-based, location information-based, time information-based, and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0094">For example, the type of application may be stored in the mobile terminal <b>100</b> and checked from the registration information of the application managed by an operating system. The registration information of the application may include an ID for identifying the application, a name of the application, and the like. If an application is executed, for example, then the change controller <b>220</b> may determine and check the type of application based on the name of the application from the registration information of the application.</p>
    <p num="p-0095">Otherwise, the type of application may be checked from the registration information of the application stored in the mobile terminal <b>100</b> and independently managed by an operating system. In this case, the registration information of the application may include an ID for identifying the application, a name of the application, a type of the application, and the like. If an application is executed, for example, then the change controller <b>220</b> may determine and check the type of application from the registration information of the application.</p>
    <p num="p-0096">Furthermore, the change controller <b>220</b> may change a delay time based on the checked type of application. In this case, the change controller <b>220</b> may reduce or extend a delay time based on the checked type of application.</p>
    <p num="p-0097">For example, if a user input is not received for T seconds, then screen lock may be carried out by the execution controller <b>210</b>. In this case, for the type of application being executed, if an input of information may be delayed as in the writing of a message or a display of information may be delayed as in the searching for data, then the change controller <b>220</b> may change the delay time from T to 2T seconds, for example. Accordingly, the execution controller <b>210</b> may not execute screen lock even when T seconds have passed, but may execute screen lock when a user input is not received until 2T seconds have passed.</p>
    <p num="p-0098">Otherwise, for the type of application being executed, if an input or display of information is unnecessary or at least is not delayed as in case of being executed on a background, then the change controller <b>220</b> may change the delay time from T to 0.5T second, for example. Accordingly, the execution controller <b>210</b> may execute screen lock without waiting until T seconds have passed if a user input is not received until 0.5T second has passed.</p>
    <p num="p-0099">The change controller <b>220</b> according to a second embodiment of the present disclosure may change a delay time based on the user's gaze information. Here, the gaze information may mean a line connecting a user's eye to the display unit <b>151</b> or visual information displayed on the display unit <b>151</b>. The change controller <b>220</b> may determine whether the user stares at the display unit <b>151</b> or visual information displayed on the display unit <b>151</b> based on the gaze information. Furthermore, the change controller <b>220</b> may determine the user's stare time at the display unit <b>151</b> or visual information displayed on the display unit <b>151</b> based on the gaze information.</p>
    <p num="p-0100">According to an embodiment, if a user's input is applied through the user input unit <b>130</b> or visual information is continuously displayed through the display unit <b>151</b>, then tilt of the mobile terminal and/or the user's grip type of the mobile terminal may form a predetermined pattern. For example, a situation requiring a user input such as the writing of a message, a situation requiring a display of visual information such as the reproduction of an image, and a situation where the user merely possesses the mobile terminal <b>100</b> or puts it in his or her pocket may be distinguished by tilt of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> or the user's grip type of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. In this case, if the tilt of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> or the user's grip type of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> corresponds to a predetermined pattern, then the change controller <b>220</b> may determine it as a state in which the user stares at the display unit <b>151</b> or visual information displayed on the display unit <b>151</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0101">Otherwise, if a user's input is applied through the user input unit <b>130</b> or visual information is continuously displayed through the display unit <b>151</b>, then the user's face region may be detected on an image in which the user has been captured through an optical sensor provided at the same surface as the surface provided with the display unit <b>151</b>. For example, a situation requiring a user input such as the writing of a message, a situation requiring a display of visual information such as the reproduction of an image, and a situation where the user approaches the mobile terminal <b>100</b> to his or her ear or puts it in his or her pocket may be distinguished by the user's face region detected on an image in which the user has been captured. In this case, if a face region is detected on a captured image of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, then the change controller <b>220</b> may determine it as a state in which the user stares at the display unit <b>151</b> or visual information displayed on the display unit <b>151</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0102">Furthermore, the change controller <b>220</b> may change a delay time based on the user's gaze information. In this case, the change controller <b>220</b> may reduce or extend the delay time based on the user's gaze information.</p>
    <p num="p-0103">For example, if a user input is not received for T seconds, then screen lock may be executed by the execution controller <b>210</b>. If it is determined that the user stares at the display unit <b>151</b> or visual information displayed on the display unit <b>151</b>, then the change controller <b>220</b> may change the delay time from T to 2T seconds, for example. Accordingly, the execution controller <b>210</b> may not execute screen lock even when T seconds have passed, but may execute screen lock when a user input is not received until 2T seconds have passed.</p>
    <p num="p-0104">Furthermore, if it is determined that the user does not stare at the display unit <b>151</b> or visual information displayed on the display unit <b>151</b>, then the change controller <b>220</b> may change the delay time from T to 0.5 T second, for example. Accordingly, the execution controller <b>210</b> may execute screen lock without waiting until T seconds have passed if a user input is not received until 0.5T second has passed.</p>
    <p num="p-0105">As a result, the execution of screen lock may be advanced or delayed according to the type of application or the user's gaze information, and the execution of screen lock by the controller <b>180</b> may be managed in a flexible manner, thereby reducing inconvenience due to an interrupt that can be generated during the user's input or display of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, as well as enhancing the effectiveness of a battery.</p>

    <p num="p-0107">If a user input is not received for a delay time, then the execution controller <b>210</b> may execute screen lock. For example, if there is no application being executed on a foreground in the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, then an idle screen may be displayed on the display unit <b>151</b>. An object <b>310</b> set to call a function provided by the mobile terminal <b>100</b> may be displayed on the idle screen.</p>
    <p num="p-0108">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, for example, a time at which all applications being executed on a foreground are terminated to display an idle screen on the display unit <b>151</b> may be START. The execution controller <b>210</b> counts a time until a user input such as an input for selecting the object <b>310</b> is received from the user, for example. If the user input is not received until a preset T seconds have passed, in other words, until the time is END, then the execution controller <b>210</b> may execute screen lock. Accordingly, the idle screen may be switched to a preset screen including an item <b>320</b> indicating screen lock.</p>
    <p num="p-0109"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a view for describing the change of a delay time for screen lock execution according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p>

In this case, the change controller <b>220</b> may check the type of application. The execution controller <b>210</b>, for example, counts a time until a user input such as an input for terminating the display of contact information is received from the user.</p>
    <p num="p-0112">The change controller <b>220</b> may change a delay time, T seconds, based on the type of application. If a delay time of screen lock execution corresponding to the type of application is 2T, then the change controller <b>220</b> may change the delay time of screen lock execution that can be approached by the execution controller <b>210</b> from T to 2T. Accordingly, a display screen of the contact information <b>410</b> may be switched to a preset screen including an item <b>420</b> indicating screen lock after 2T has passed by the execution controller <b>210</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0113">Otherwise, if a delay time of screen lock execution corresponding to the type of application is 0.5T, then the change controller <b>220</b> may change the delay time of screen lock execution that can be approached by the execution controller <b>210</b> from T to 0.5T. Accordingly, a display screen of the contact information <b>410</b> may be switched to a preset screen including an item <b>420</b> indicating screen lock after 0.5T has passed by the execution controller <b>210</b>.</p>

    <p num="p-0115">When an application being executed is a content-based application, the change controller <b>220</b> may change a delay time based on the reproduction information of content. For example, the content-based application may include video player, music player, photo viewer, and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0116">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, for example, an application for playing content may be executed in the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, and a content reproduction screen <b>510</b> may be displayed on the display unit <b>151</b>. Furthermore, a reproduction control region <b>520</b> of content may be further displayed on the display unit <b>151</b> together with the content reproduction screen <b>510</b>. The change controller <b>220</b> may check that the type of application being executed is a content-based application, and may check a delay time for the content-based application. Furthermore, the change controller <b>220</b> may change a delay time of screen lock execution by the execution controller <b>210</b> to the checked delay time.</p>
    <p num="p-0117">Furthermore, in this case, the change controller <b>220</b> may change a delay time of screen lock execution by the execution controller <b>210</b> according to the reproduction information of content. For example, the change controller <b>220</b> may change a delay time to delay screen lock execution if the content is being reproduced, and change a delay time to advance screen lock execution if the content is not being reproduced.</p>

The messaging service may be any one of a text message service, an instant message service, and an email service. Furthermore, the text message service may be any one of a short message service, a multimedia message service, and an enhanced message service.</p>
    <p num="p-0124">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, for example, an application for writing a message is executed in the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, and a message preparation screen may be displayed on the display unit <b>151</b>. The message preparation screen may include a key input interface <b>710</b>, a receiver information display region <b>720</b>, and a message content display region <b>730</b>. The change controller <b>220</b> may check that the type of application being executed is a messaging service-based application, and check a delay time for the messaging service-based application. Furthermore, the change controller <b>220</b> may change a delay time of screen lock execution by the execution controller <b>210</b> to the checked delay time.</p>
    <p num="p-0125">Furthermore, in this case, the change controller <b>220</b> may change a delay time of screen lock execution by the execution controller <b>210</b> according to an input time of message. For example, the change controller <b>220</b> may change a delay time to a time in which the user's search word input time (for example, an average time consumed from the user's input start time of message content (an input time of the first letter (or, numeral or symbol) of message content) to an input end time (an input time of message content input complete command or message transmission command)) is added to the delay time.</p>
    <p num="p-0126"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a view for describing the change of a delay time for screen lock execution in a location information-based application according to a first embodiment of the present disclosure.</p>
    <p num="p-0127">When an application being executed is a location information-based application, the change controller <b>220</b> may change a delay time based on a change of location information. The location information-based application may include navigation (road guide), traffic information, map application, and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0128">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, for example, an application for displaying road guide information may be executed in the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, and a display screen of road guide information may be displayed on the display unit <b>151</b>. The display screen of road guide information may further include a map information display region <b>810</b>, a road guide information display region <b>820</b>, and a turn information display region <b>830</b>. The change controller <b>220</b> may check that the type of application being executed is a location information-based application, and may check a delay time for the location information-based application. Furthermore, the change controller <b>220</b> may change a delay time of screen lock execution by the execution controller <b>210</b> to the checked delay time.</p>
    <p num="p-0129">Furthermore, in this case, the change controller <b>220</b> may change a delay time of screen lock execution by the execution controller <b>210</b> according to a change of location information. For example, the change controller <b>220</b> may change a delay time to delay screen lock execution if the location information is being changed, and change a delay time to advance screen lock execution if the location information is not being changed.</p>
    <p num="p-0130"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a view for describing the change of a delay time for screen lock execution in a time information-based application according to a first embodiment of the present disclosure.</p>
    <p num="p-0131">When an application being executed is a time information-based application, the change controller <b>220</b> may change a delay time based on a change of time information. The time information-based application may include alarm, scheduler, traffic information, and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0132">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, for example, an application for displaying traffic information may be executed in the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, and a display screen of traffic information may be displayed on the display unit <b>151</b>. The display screen of traffic information may further include a location display region <b>910</b>, a traffic information display region <b>920</b>, and a refresh menu display region <b>930</b>. The change controller <b>220</b> may check that the type of application being executed is a time-based application, and may check a delay time for the time-based application. Furthermore, the change controller <b>220</b> may change a delay time of screen lock execution by the execution controller <b>210</b> to the checked delay time.</p>
    <p num="p-0133">Furthermore, in this case, the change controller <b>220</b> may change a delay time of screen lock execution by the execution controller <b>210</b> according to a change of time information. For example, if information displayed on traffic information display region <b>920</b> is being changed according to time variation (i.e., if refreshed periodically), then the change controller <b>220</b> may change a delay time to delay screen lock execution. Furthermore, if information displayed on traffic information display region <b>920</b> is not being changed according to time variation, then the change controller <b>220</b> may change a delay time to advance screen lock execution.</p>
    <p num="p-0134"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a view for describing the change of a delay time for screen lock execution in an application that can approach security set data according to a first embodiment of the present disclosure.</p>
    <p num="p-0135">The change controller <b>220</b> may change a delay time based on security setting for an object being approached by an application. For example, the change controller <b>220</b> may check security setting for an object being approached by an application to change a delay time based on the security setting.</p>
    <p num="p-0136">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, for example, an application displaying an object <b>1010</b> (for example, content) is being executed, and the change controller <b>220</b> may change a delay time based on the type of application. The security setting for an object may include a public setting capable of immediately approaching an object without an authentication key and a non-public setting capable of approaching an object only by inputting an authentication key. If security setting for an object being approached by an application is non-public, the extension of a delay time may be restricted, but only the reduction of a delay time may be allowed. Accordingly, it may be possible to prevent worry of harming the security of an object due to the extension of a delay time to an object with a non-public setting.</p>

    <p num="p-0138">The change controller <b>220</b> may change a delay time based on an interrupt generated by an application. The change controller <b>220</b> may monitor the generation of an interrupt such as notification of a message arrival event in the application to change a start time of the delay time to an interrupt generation time when an interrupt has been generated. The execution controller <b>210</b> may count a delay time of screen lock execution again from the changed start time of the delay time.</p>
    <p num="p-0139">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, for example, an application for writing a message is executed in the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, and a message writing screen may be displayed on the display unit <b>151</b>. The message writing screen may include a key input interface <b>1112</b>, <b>1122</b>, a receiver information display region <b>1114</b>, <b>1124</b>, and a message content display region <b>1116</b>, <b>1126</b>. A start time of the delay time of screen lock execution by the execution controller <b>210</b> may be START<b>1</b> that has received the last input. For example, if the notification of a message arrival event is generated in the application, then a message arrival event <b>1128</b> may be displayed on the screen. In this case, the change controller <b>220</b> may change the start time of the delay time of screen lock execution to START<b>2</b>, which is a time at which the notification of a message arrival event has been generated. The execution controller <b>210</b> may count the delay time of screen lock execution again from START<b>2</b>.</p>
