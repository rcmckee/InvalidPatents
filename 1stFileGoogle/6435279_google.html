    <heading>BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</heading> <p>This invention relates to a method and apparatus for sampling fluids from a wellbore, and in particular to a method and apparatus used to recover a quantity of production fluids such as produced oil, gas and/or water from the wellhead of an underwater well.</p>
    <p>Wells for hydrocarbons and other valuable fluids are normally drilled in a cluster with a number of wellbores having their surface wellheads grouped together. The wellbore may diverge away from each other the deeper they become. The wellheads in a group of wells are typically connected to a manifold or other subsea structure via conduits, and the hydrocarbons recovered from each individual well are conveyed along the conduits to the manifold where they usually co-mingle before flowing along a single main pipeline to the production platform. The quality and quantity of the fluids produced from each well may vary; for example, one wellbore may produce production fluids that are rich in crude oil and relatively free from produced water and corrosive gasses such as H<sub>2</sub>S, whereas a neighbouring well drilled to a different depth in the same formation may produce more water, or may have a high content of noxious and corrosive gasses; such a well would be less economically productive and may have higher maintenance costs. Furthermore, different wells tied back to the same manifold may be owned and/or operated by different operators. It is therefore useful to know the quantity and quality of wellbore fluids that are produced from each respective wellbore before they are mixed in the manifold or main pipeline leading from the manifold to the production platform, so that the relative benefits and liabilities of the respective wells can be calculated.</p>
    <p>Traditionally this has been done by sampling the fluids produced at each respective wellbore by providing separate sampling conduits or lines that run parallel to (and usually along the outside of) the conduits between the respective wellbores and the manifold, and from there along the main pipeline back to the production platform, where they can be analysed and graded. Separate sampling lines are of course needed for each wellbore, and this causes several problems in that the additional small bore lines often become blocked by viscous fluids and cuttings, or damaged by corrosive agents like H<sub>2</sub>S, and to address this several lines are normally installed for each wellhead all the way back to the platform, so that backup lines can be brought into operation if the main sampling line for a particular wellhead fails or becomes blocked. This is very expensive and the infrastructure of the extra lines needs to be installed at the beginning of the life of a well, but is seen as the only solution to the problems of being able to sample continuously throughout the life of the well.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>According to the present invention there is provided a method for sampling a fluid from a wellbore, the method comprising</p>
    <p>a vehicle having a drive means for moving the vehicle, a collecting device for collecting a sample of the fluid and a storage facility for the collected fluid;</p>
    <p>using the collecting device to recover a sample of the fluid to the vehicle's storage facility at a first location on a subsea structure;</p>
    <p>storing the sample in the storage facility of the vehicle; and</p>
    <p>carrying the sample in the vehicle's storage facility to a second location.</p>
    <p>The present invention also provides a sampling device for collecting samples of fluid produced from a subsea wellbore, the sampling device having;</p>
    <p>a drive means for moving the sampling device, a collection device for collecting a sample of fluid and a storage container for holding the collected fluid.</p>
    <p>The first location is typically a wellhead but can be other positions of a well such as a wellbore, pipeline from the wellhead, side-track manifold, or main pipeline, storage tank or gravity base structure. The first position typically has a collection port to mate with the collection apparatus. The second position can be onshore, underwater or on a platform or ship such as a remotely operated vehicle or “ROV”.</p>
    <p>Preferably the vehicle is an ROV. Preferably the storage tank and collection device are housed on a frame or skid attached to the ROV. Typically the collecting device comprises at least one sampling bottle, but two or more can be provided.</p>
    <p>Typically the vehicle is adapted to interface with the wellhead at the first position, and can be provided with a collecting and sampling probe for insertion into e.g. an aperture on the wellhead. The probe can be connected to the storage tanks or bottles etc by means of conduits. Typically production fluids are extracted via the male/female connection between the probe and the aperture. The collecting device can be arranged to collect and discard a portion of the fluids being sampled, and typically recovers an initial sample of fluid from the collection port of the wellhead to a first sampling bottle. This is done because the fluid lying in the collection port of the wellhead may be static and may not represent a true sample of the fluid flowing through the wellhead. Therefore, the first sample of fluid from the collection port of the wellhead is drawn off to a first sampling bottle and can be kept separate from later samples. Any number of later samples e.g. 3-10 can be taken from the fluid flowing through the wellhead, depending on the number of sampling bottles or partitions in the collection tank that are available. Typically a waste tank is provided at the second position into which the initial samples of static fluid can be discarded.</p>
    <p>Typically the vehicle has an array of valves which can be activated independently of each other. Typically different configuration of the valves will direct liquid into each sampling bottle as required. Typically the sampling bottles each contain a piston. Normally a pressure gauge is connected to each sampling bottle. Normally a piston indicator is provided so the position of the piston can be determined from a remote position outside the bottle. Typically the piston indicator moves with the piston, but it may be an electronic indicator that is monitored elsewhere on the ROV or remote from it. Typically the piston indicator is a rod which extends from the piston outside the bottle. Typically the sampling bottles are connected to the male connector via a hose of e.g. {fraction (1/4+L )}″ diameter. The sampling bottles, valves and hose are typically designed to operate in pressure of up to 230 barg and at temperatures of −50 to 130° C.</p>
    <p>During transportation of the ROV prior to use, the sampling apparatus is typically filled with a liquid. Preferably the liquid is bio-degradable. Typically the liquid is a mixture of water and glycol.</p>
    <p>Typically the liquid is contained in the sampling bottles when the vehicle dives. Typically the liquid is expelled from a second end of the sampling apparatus as fluid is recovered from the wellhead. Preferably a control means such as a throttle is provided on the second end of the sampling apparatus to control the rate of expulsion of the liquid. This typically controls the rate of introduction of the fluid from the wellhead into the first end of the sampling apparatus, typically via the piston.</p>
    <p>When production fluids have been extracted from the first wellhead the vehicle typically disengages the probe from the collection port on the wellhead and moves (in ROV terminology it “flies”) to the second position. The second position can typically be an offshore platform, a ship or an inshore facility. The vehicle typically docks at the second position where the sample(s) collected may be removed by e.g. removing the sampling bottles and replacing them with empty bottles. Typically only the second and subsequent sampling bottles are replaced. Typically the fluid(s) contained in the second or further sampling bottle is analysed for fluid chemistry.</p>
    <p>In several important embodiments of the invention the collection device has several separate containers such as bottles for collecting samples and the vehicle flies between adjacent wellheads to collect samples from each of them before returning to the ship or platform etc for analysis of the samples. In this embodiment the vehicle can collect different samples from adjacent wellheads on a single trip.</p>
    <p>While the ROV can be typically tied back to a ship or platform by a conventional umbilical the vehicle need not be a conventional ROV.</p>
    <p>Typically the fluids contained in the first sampling bottle will be released into the waste tank. Normally this operation is performed at the second position. Typically a particular combination of open and closed valves can be used to direct fluids from any sampling bottle to the waste tank.</p>
    <p>The pipework is typically vented before the sampling bottles are removed. This typically allows the pressure in the pipework to be equilibrate with ambient pressure and so ease the removal of the sampling bottles from the vehicle. Typically a particular configuration of the valves can be used to vent the pipework. After the pipework has been vented the sampling bottle(s) may be removed.</p>
    <p>A new bottle is typically attached to the sampling apparatus. Typically the sampling apparatus is flushed with de-mineralised water to prevent cross-contamination between samples. Typically the sampling apparatus is purged with nitrogen prior to a subsequent sampling run in order to remove air from the pipework. Typically the sampling apparatus will be tested for leaks whenever a sampling bottle has been replaced.</p>
    <p>Typically the vehicle (or at least the collection device) will undergo a hydrotest before a second operation. In the hydrotest the sampling bottles are filled with de-mineralised water and pressurised up to 230 barg. If no leaks or change in pressure are observed after a period in the order of 30 minutes the vehicle is typically subjected to a gas test. During the gas test, the vehicle (or at least the collection device) is typically submerged in a water bath and is flushed with Nitrogen gas through the probe to subject the sampling apparatus to a pressure of up to 125 barg. Any leaks would clearly be observed in the form of bubbles escaping from the vehicle or collection device.</p>

The TDU <b>80</b> may comprise various tools like grabs, cameras, docking probes and sockets to facilitate docking of the ROV 200 with a manifold etc and can move in a vertical, horizontal and fore-aft direction relative to the ROV 200. The TDU chosen typically has a low torque tool mounting bracket <b>65</b> fitted to the lower carriage of the ROV 200 and two low torque tools <b>61</b>, <b>62</b> fitted to the port side of the mounting bracket <b>65</b>. The tools <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> are primarily for activating isolation valves <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> on the wellhead but can be used for a wide variety of other operations. A grabber tool <b>63</b> is fitted to the starboard side of the mounting bracket <b>65</b> and holds a single port male hot stab tool <b>33</b> fitted with a grabber handle to connect with the grabber tool <b>63</b>. The male hot stab tool <b>33</b> is typically a standard sampling probe. The male hot stab tool <b>33</b> is connected to the sampling equipment <b>100</b> by a hose <b>23</b> and two hydraulic lines. In practise it may be necessary to alter the configuration of the low torque tools <b>61</b>, <b>62</b> and the grabber tool <b>63</b> so they correspond with the receptacles and valves at the particular wellhead where the ROV 200 will be docking.</p>
    <p>The TDU has two docking probes <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> which engage receptacles (not shown) at the wellhead. These stabilise the ROV 200 in position when it docks at a wellhead. Alternatively, other docking means may be used.</p>
    <p>The sampling skid has a quick-connect fail-safe release mechanism <b>66</b> in-line with the hoses <b>23</b> to the hot stab tool <b>33</b> securely mounted in a suitable location on the ROV 200 frame. The fail safe mechanism is activated when either hydraulic or electric power is lost to the sampling skid and ensures that no hydrocarbons are lost and that the ROV 200 may be recovered. An accumulator <b>54</b> is provided, charged with hydraulic power to provide power in sequence to various parts of the skid if necessary. First, the accumulator provides power to the torque tools <b>61</b>, <b>62</b> to close off the isolation valves <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>. Then, the fluid connection between the male stab and the female connector is broken. Each of the hoses connecting the male hot stab to the sampling skid are then broken and the male hot stab is left loosely attached to the female member. The hoses which connect the male hot-stab to the skid are self-sealing and so do not pollute the environment when disconnected. A separate accumulator on the TDU (not shown) provides power for the ROV 200 to disengage from the receptacles. The ROV 200 is then recovered for example by towing in, repaired and re-deployed.</p>
    <p>A camera pan unit <b>68</b> is provided on the mounting bracket <b>65</b> of the TDU positioned to allow the camera to view the low torque tools <b>61</b>, <b>62</b> and the hot stab tool <b>33</b>. Other tooling cameras (not shown) are provided (i) mounted to the camera pan unit for vertical alignment of the low torque tools <b>61</b>, <b>62</b> and hot-stab tool <b>33</b> with their interfaces and to monitor torque tool turns, (ii) mounted to the TDU for horizontal alignment of the low torque tools <b>61</b>, <b>62</b> and the hot-stab tool <b>33</b> with their interfaces and to monitor torque tool turns, (iii) positioned to view the pressure gauge <b>29</b> and indicator rod <b>39</b> on the first sampling bottle <b>10</b>, (iv) positioned to view the pressure gauge <b>129</b> and indicator rod <b>139</b> on the second sample bottle <b>110</b>, (v) positioned to view the status of actuated valves <b>14</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>. Instead of or in addition to cameras to view the rods and tools directly the condition and positions of the dials and tools can optionally be reported electronically. The monitoring apparatus can be adapted to indicate the characteristics of the sampled fluid on either a continuous or intermittent basis.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 18<i>a </i>to FIGS. 18<i>f </i>show the arrangement of the parts which make up the skid. The sampling apparatus <b>100</b> is mounted onto a skid frame <b>60</b>. Buoyancy members <b>92</b> are attached to a buoyancy frame <b>91</b> to provide stability to the ROV 200 during operation underwater.</p>
    <p>The sampling bottles <b>10</b>, <b>110</b> are connected by a sampling line which comprises a series of valves. A hydraulic supply <b>52</b> is provided at the centre of the skid frame <b>60</b> to provide a means to actuate the hydraulic valves via a hydraulic circuit. Two compensators <b>53</b> are provided to hold the pressure of the oil in the hydraulic circuit above ambient pressure. This ensures that a small leak would not result in water being allowed into the hydraulic circuit. An accumulator <b>54</b> provides a hydraulic energy to the valve circuit in the event of a power failure. A dedicated interface or control unit <b>56</b> receives all cable connections including power connections and control signals such as position indicators, valve and control actuation, and camera signals etc. The control unit <b>52</b> is in turn connected to the valve pack <b>52</b> which directs hydraulic signals to the valves accordingly. A drawer assembly extends out from each side of the skid frame <b>60</b> to access the sampling bottle <b>10</b> while onshore. The drawer assembly comprises an outer drawer <b>64</b> which houses an inner drawer <b>63</b>. The outer assembly <b>64</b> slides out from the skid and the inner assembly <b>63</b> slides out from the outer assembly <b>64</b> in a telescopic manner. The sampling bottle <b>10</b> is mounted on the inner drawer <b>63</b> and may be conveniently accessed. A similar drawer assembly (not shown) is provided for the second sample bottle <b>110</b>. The gauge typically remains fixed to the sample bottles <b>10</b>, <b>110</b> when removed.</p>
    <p>When the samples have been collected from the wellhead the ROV 200 docks at the operating station and a slops tank <b>41</b> is connected to the sampling apparatus <b>100</b> by line <b>123</b> via a valve <b>26</b> and a valve <b>45</b> as shown in FIG. <b>21</b>. The slops tank <b>41</b> comprises a tank <b>42</b>, a pressure gauge <b>43</b>, a temperature gauge <b>44</b> and three valves <b>45</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>47</b>. In practise the first sampling bottle <b>10</b> is used to store production fluids that are drawn initially from the collection port at the wellhead, as the initial sample will generally be of fluids that are lodged static in the wellhead rather than an accurate reflection of the fluids flowing through the wellhead. Therefore the fluids from the first sampling bottle <b>10</b> will typically be expelled into the slops tank <b>41</b>.</p>
    <p>The pressure <b>43</b> and temperature gauges <b>44</b> on the slops tank <b>41</b> should be visible from manual control valve <b>26</b>. A blind flange <b>48</b> is provided for positive isolation after the inlet piping <b>49</b> has been disconnected. Typically the level of the liquid in the tank <b>42</b> is measured using a portable, non-intrusive level gauge (not shown).</p>
    <p>The sampling apparatus <b>100</b> is typically completely vented, dismantled and cleaned between offshore trips. The sampling apparatus <b>100</b> is tested prior to each mobilisation to check its integrity and to confirm there has been no degradation of components, such as steels, during storage. The first test is a hydrostatic test. The pressure of the water during the hydrotest will normally be up to 230 barg and de-mineralised water is normally used.</p>
    <p>In the hydrostatic test the water pump <b>25</b> is connected to the connection means <b>30</b> (not as shown) and the valve <b>12</b> is opened. Water is pumped into the first sampling bottle until the piston is pushed to approximately half way along the bottle and the valve <b>12</b> is closed. The equivalent operation is then performed for the second sampling bottle <b>110</b>. That is, the water pump <b>25</b> is connected to the connection means <b>130</b> and the valve <b>112</b> is opened. Water is pumped into the second sampling bottle <b>110</b> until the piston <b>116</b> is pushed to approximately half way along the bottle and the valve <b>112</b> is closed. The male plugs <b>30</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>50</b> are removed to make the system more sensitive to leaks. The valves are then switched to the status as shown in FIG. <b>1</b>. That is valves <b>14</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>126</b> are closed off and the remaining valves <b>11</b>, <b>111</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>117</b>, <b>19</b>, <b>119</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> are opened. De-mineralised water is pumped into the apparatus as shown in FIG. <b>2</b>. The pressure is increased in steps up to the test pressure of 230 barg.</p>
    <p>The water pump is then disconnected and the system left for a period of 30 mins. The pressure is monitored and any change indicates a leak.</p>
    <p>Once the pressure test is complete valve <b>26</b> can be opened to drain and depressurise the skid. Provided a satisfactory hydrotest has been completed the gas test can now be carried out.</p>
    <p>The gas test equipment set-up is shown in FIG. 2<i>b</i>. To start the test the skid is depressurised and the valves <b>12</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>112</b> and <b>118</b> are opened to ensure there is no trapped pressure. Hoses are attached to connection points <b>30</b>, <b>130</b>. Water will be pushed out through valves <b>12</b>, <b>112</b> when the pistons are pushed to the back of the bottles.</p>
    <p>Valves <b>14</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>118</b> and <b>26</b> are closed and valves <b>11</b>,<b>12</b>,<b>13</b>,<b>17</b>,<b>22</b>,<b>19</b>,<b>20</b>,<b>113</b>,<b>117</b>,<b>119</b>,<b>111</b>,<b>120</b> and <b>112</b> are open as shown in FIG. 2<i>b</i>. The system is then connected to a compressed nitrogen supply via the male/female hot stab connection <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, before the skid <b>160</b> is submerged in a water bath and the nitrogen supply regulator is set to 125 barg. Hydraulic pressure is applied to open the hot stab sleeve <b>35</b>, and the system is then purged with nitrogen. The pistons are checked for movement to ensure that the bottles have been purged. Water should be pushed out the back end of the bottles through the connections at <b>12</b> and <b>112</b>. It is important that the pistons are against their stops at the back of the sample bottle so that the piston seals are subject to a differential pressure.</p>
    <p>The hydraulic supply to the male hot stab is then removed in order to close the sleeve <b>35</b>, and the nitrogen supply is then isolated and disconnected.</p>
    <p>The submerged skid <b>160</b> is checked for about 30 mins for bubbles indicating leaks. If the piston seals are leaking bubbles may be seen leaving the skid from connections to the vents lines from <b>12</b> to <b>112</b>.</p>
    <p>With the skid <b>160</b> removed from the bath valve <b>26</b> is opened and the system is vented to atmospheric pressure.</p>
    <p>Before offshore mobilisation the skid can be re-tested in order to check the integrity of all connections. The slops tank <b>41</b> is assembled as shown in FIG. <b>21</b>. Valves <b>46</b>, <b>47</b> are closed and valve <b>45</b> is opened.</p>
    <p>The slops tank <b>41</b> is then filled with nitrogen via the valve <b>45</b> up to a pressure of 2.5 barg. The outlet ports from all valves are left clear so that leaks past the valves can be detected, and the skid is allowed to stabilise for a period of 10 mins. Valve <b>45</b> is closed and the nitrogen supply is disconnected while pressure is monitored for a period of 30 minutes and a soapy solution is applied to all flange joints and valve body joints to check for leaks.</p>
    <p>If there is leakage it will most likely be past the valves or from the flanged connection on the vessel. The flanged connections may have to be re-assembled or the valves refurbished/replaced.</p>
    <p>After the test the valve on the slops tank <b>41</b> can be released and the pressure in the tank allowed to drop until it reaches 0.1 barg.</p>
    <p>To transport the skid before operation the sample bottles <b>10</b>, <b>110</b> are filled with a water glycol mix according to the following procedure with reference to FIG. 3 after the tests for leaks are performed as described already.</p>
    <p>The sampling system is vented down to atmospheric pressure. When the leak testing is complete valves <b>14</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>118</b> and <b>26</b> are closed, and all other valves should be open.</p>
    <p>A water/glycol supply pump is connected to the connection as <b>12</b> and fluid is pumped into the back <b>27</b> of the sampling bottle <b>10</b>, checking that the piston <b>16</b> moves towards the front of the bottle.</p>
    <p>When the piston <b>16</b> reaches the front of bottle <b>10</b> valves <b>12</b> and <b>20</b> are closed, and the water/glycol pump supply line is moved to the connection at <b>112</b>, so that fluid is pumped into the back of bottle <b>110</b>. When the piston <b>116</b> reaches the front <b>128</b> of bottle <b>110</b> valve <b>112</b> is closed as are valves <b>120</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>26</b> in sequence.</p>
    <p>At this point the manual needle valves <b>15</b>, <b>115</b> in the vent lines from <b>14</b> and <b>114</b> should be at {fraction (1/4+L )} turn open. Pressure caps are then inserted at the exit of valves <b>26</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>112</b> &amp; <b>118</b>, and the tubing ends at the vent lines from <b>14</b> and <b>114</b> are capped off. Valves <b>26</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>112</b> &amp; <b>118</b> are then locked in the closed position, and at this point the bottle pistons <b>16</b>, <b>116</b> should both still be at the front end <b>28</b>, <b>128</b> of the bottles.</p>
    <p>The system is now in its transport condition (refer to FIG. 4<i>a</i>). Typically the water/glycol mix will be present in the sampling bottles when the ROV 100 and attached skid 160 dives.</p>
    <p>Spare sample bottles are provided and require to have the production fluid side flushed with de-mineralised water. These bottles should be separately hydrotested to 230 barg and nitrogen tested to 125 barg to test the piston seals and valves.</p>
    <p>The back end <b>27</b>, <b>127</b> of each of the bottles <b>10</b>, <b>110</b> is filled with the water/glycol mix so that the piston <b>16</b>, <b>116</b> is at the front <b>28</b>, <b>128</b> of the bottle. All valves on these bottles are left in the CLOSED position (refer to FIG. 4<i>b</i>).</p>
    <p>In use for sampling operations, the ROV 200 flies to the wellhead and docks at a panel (not shown). The docking probes <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> are inserted and the ROV 200 is stabilised. The male hot stab <b>33</b> on the mounting bracket <b>64</b> is aligned with and inserted into the female connection <b>34</b> on the wellhead. The grabber tool <b>63</b> then releases the hot stab tool <b>33</b> and the lower carriage of the tool deployment unit is withdrawn.</p>
    <p>Samples are then removed from the wellhead as follows: The current inlet pressure to the manifold flowmeter is checked and recorded with a central processing facility. The pressure can typically be read from the pressure transmitter at the inlet to the flowmeter or from the transmitter within the flowmeter. The operating pressure read at the manifold should not be greater than 97 barg. However, as the accuracy of the subsea manifold gauges cannot be guaranteed a sample may still be taken even if the manifold gauge reading is greater than 97 barg.</p>
    <p>The panel valves should be configured as shown in FIG. 6<i>a</i>. Hydraulic pressure is applied to the male hot stab in order to push back the sleeve <b>35</b>. The sample isolation valves <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> on the panel are operated using the low torque tools <b>61</b>, <b>62</b>. Sample Isolation Valve <b>32</b> is opened (FIG. 6<i>b</i>) to admit the sample into the collecting device and then closed. Thus the pressure between the two sample isolation valves <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> will be the flowmeter operating pressure as determined from step <b>2</b> (FIG. 6<i>c</i>).</p>
    <p>Sample Isolation Valve <b>31</b> is opened to expose the hot stab connection to pressure whilst still providing isolation between the flowmeter and the hot stab (FIG. 6<i>d</i>). Preferably the operator should observe that there is no fluid leakage from the hot stab. If there is fluid leakage then Sample Isolation Valve <b>31</b> is preferably closed and the sampling operation must be re-attempted after the hot stab connector is checked. In this case the hot stab sleeve <b>35</b> is closed and removed while the ROV 200 undocks from the panel and is recovered the surface where the Sample Isolation Valve <b>32</b> is opened.</p>
    <p>Preferably the XYZ tool position at the Sample Isolation Valves <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> is maintained. This enables quick isolation of the line to be made should any problems be encountered.</p>
    <p>Valves <b>22</b> and <b>20</b> are then opened as shown on FIG. <b>7</b>. This will expose bottle <b>10</b> to the operating pressure. Check that the pressure gauge on bottle <b>10</b> indicates the pressure of the sampled fluid, and valve <b>14</b> is then opened. This will allow the water/glycol mix to exit from the back <b>27</b> of bottle <b>10</b> and production fluid into the front <b>28</b> (as shown on FIG. <b>8</b>). The time taken for the piston to move from the front <b>28</b> to the back <b>27</b> of the sample bottle is recorded. The typical time taken for a 5 litre sample is set out in the table below.</p>

    <p>The bottle <b>10</b> fills with fluid under pressure from the manifold and the fill can confirmed by the piston position indicator. When the piston stops moving the pressure shown on the bottle gauge should increase up to the manifold pressure.</p>
    <p>If after 5 minutes the bottle piston has not moved it must be assumed that there is some form of blockage in the line such as a build up of hydrates. In this case the sampling operation may be abandoned. In this case the valves <b>22</b>, <b>120</b> and <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> are closed, and the ROV 200 undocks from the panel and is recovered to the surface.</p>
    <p>In the event of satisfactory fill, the valves <b>20</b>,<b>14</b> are closed when the piston moves to the back of the bottle.</p>
    <p>Valve <b>120</b> is opened and the pressure gauge on the bottle <b>110</b> is checked to indicate the pressure of the sampled fluid.</p>
    <p>Valve <b>114</b> is then opened and the time taken for the piston to move from the front <b>128</b> to the back <b>127</b> of the bottle is recorded. Typically the time to taken for the second bottle <b>10</b> to fill will be similar to the times given for the first sampling bottle <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>As the sampling bottle <b>110</b> is filled with fluids from the wellbore at its first end <b>128</b>, the water/glycol mix is expelled from its second end <b>127</b>. A throttle (not shown) may be provided to control the rate at which the water/glycol is expelled and so control the rate the sample fluids are introduced into the sample bottle <b>110</b>. A more representative sample of the fluids in the wellhead is typically recovered in this controlled fashion.</p>
    <p>When the bottle is full the piston rod <b>139</b> will be fully extended and the pressure shown <b>129</b> on the bottle gauge will increase to the manifold pressure.</p>
    <p>Valves <b>120</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> and <b>22</b> are closed in that sequence and hydraulic pressure is removed from the male hot stab <b>33</b> in order to close the sleeve <b>35</b>. The hot stab <b>33</b> is removed from the female connector <b>34</b>.</p>
    <p>The docking probes can be released and the ROV 200 may undock the from panel. The sampling equipment should now be configured as shown in FIG. <b>9</b>.</p>
    <p>The ROV 200 is then brought back to the rig or other operating station where the sampled fluid is recovered.</p>
    <p>The actual arrangement of equipment can vary according to the ROV 200 and other factors. Gravity is sometimes required to assist the flow of fluids from the sampling skid to the slops tank and the arrangement of the equipment on the vessel can optionally take account of this. Typically the slop tank should be located on the deck of the vessel such that the flexible vent line from the safety relief valve can extend over the edge of the vessel. The end of the flexible should preferably be situated such that it is not adjacent to any intakes, exhausts or ignition sources. The vent line should typically be secured to the side of the vessel and the area around the line roped off to personnel. The weather conditions at the time of the sampling operation should also be taken into account. This may necessitate re-locating the vent hose end.</p>
    <p>If possible the ROV 200 launch/recovery platform should be located at a higher elevation than the top of the slops tank <b>41</b>. This is to allow the waste fluids from the skids to flow into the slop tank <b>41</b>.</p>
    <p>The slops tank <b>41</b> should be positioned during transport such that it is within reach of one of the vessel cranes. This is so that, if necessary, the sampling skid can be lifted above the slops tank <b>41</b>. This may be required to give the necessary height above the slops tank <b>41</b> if this cannot be achieved from the ROV 200 launch/recovery station.</p>
    <p>The slops tank <b>41</b> should be located sufficiently close to the ROV 200 launch/recovery station such that the hose used for venting operations can reach between the connection points at <b>26</b> on the skid and the valve (not shown) on the slops tank <b>41</b>.</p>
    <p>After recovery to the surface the bottle containing the production sample is removed from the skid. The replacement of sample bottles will generally be carried out with the skid on the deck. To this end each sampling bottle <b>10</b>, <b>110</b> is mounted on a drawer assembly <b>63</b>, <b>64</b> and can be conveniently accessed. It is suggested that the connections to the ROV 200 are maintained so that hydraulic power is available to operate the actuated valves. However, if the ROV 200 is urgently required for other tasks then the skid can be disconnected from the ROV 200 and the manual overrides on the actuated valves used. This can be achieved using a hydraulic hand pump via a manual switching circuit on the skid or by a screw to maintain the piston on the valves in a closed position, so that individual valves an be physically closed. All actuated valves will typically fail in the closed position when the hydraulic supply is removed. The hot-stab comprises a spring return mechanism which will activate when the cylinder has been vented and so does not require hydraulic power to in order to open it.</p>
    <p>The pressure shown on the bottle gauges is checked. If either bottle contains fluid at greater than 97 barg then this is outwith normal operation conditions and the bottles cannot be vented as detailed below. This is due to the excessively low temperatures that would be produced when venting fluids of this pressure to the slops tank <b>41</b>. These abnormal pressures are likely to be as the result of a process upset and further sampling should not be carried out until the cause of this upset is determined. If the sampling operation is to be continued then the two bottles containing the high pressure production fluids will have to be removed and new bottles inserted will be described later.</p>
    <p>As bottle <b>10</b> will be used for each sampling it must be vented and re-filled with water/glycol between each run. Venting the skid makes use of the slops tank <b>41</b>. The following checks should be made each time the slops tank <b>41</b> is used:</p>
    <p>Valves <b>45</b>, <b>46</b> and <b>47</b> should be closed. This is particularly important the first time the tank is used offshore as it will have been filled and purged with nitrogen before shipping. If valves <b>46</b> or <b>47</b> are found to be open then the slops tank <b>41</b> must be re-purged before use. Pressure in the tank should not be greater than 2.0 barg prior to each filling operation.</p>
    <p>Temperature of the tank should be in the range −6° C. to +50° C.</p>
    <p>The tank level indication on the ultrasonic level detector is then checked. Level of the fluid in the tank should be 200 mm or less. The vent piping from the pressure safety valve should be attached and discharged to a safe area. The end of the vent piping should be free from blockages. The hose used to connect to the sampling skid should be in good condition and the end connection should be checked for debris.</p>
    <p>In order for the production fluids to be drained from the skid should typically be at a higher elevation than the slops tank <b>41</b>. If the ROV 200 launch platform is located above the top of the slops tank <b>41</b> level then the skid should be kept on the ROV 200 and the hydraulic supply can be used to actuate the valves. Ideally the operator at the ROV 200 location should be able to view the pressure and the temperature gauges on the slops tank <b>41</b> while valve <b>26</b> on the skid is being operated. If this is not possible the operator at the skid should preferably have a clear view to the slops tank <b>41</b> and a second operator should be stationed at the slops tank <b>41</b> to monitor the gauges.</p>
    <p>If the ROV 200 launch/recovery station is not at a higher elevation than the top of the slops tank <b>41</b> then the skid may have to be removed from the ROV 200 and lifted above the slops tank <b>41</b>. The following steps must be taken:</p>
    <p>1. Close all valves on the skid.</p>
    <p>2. Vent down all the hydraulic connections to the skid (actuated valves and hot stab).</p>
    <p>3. Disconnect all hydraulic and electrical lines from the ROV 200.</p>
    <p>4. Remove the skid from the ROV 200.</p>
    <p>5. The skid can now be moved by its lifting points to a location at a higher elevation than the slops tank <b>41</b>.</p>
    <p>The manual overrides on the hydraulic valves will now have to be used to operate them. The operator should be able to view the pressure <b>43</b> and temperature <b>44</b> gauges on the tank while valve <b>26</b> is being operated. If the ROV 200 launch/recovery station is at a higher elevation than these steps are not necessary. Regardless of the position of the ROV 200 launch/recovery station, the following steps should be taken.</p>
    <p>Valves <b>111</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>117</b> and <b>119</b> should be closed and valves <b>11</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> should be opened.</p>
    <p>Valve <b>26</b> should be closed, and any pressure released from behind the plug at <b>26</b> before it is removed. The plug <b>50</b> is then backed off and the cap is depressed to vent any trapped pressure. Once the plug <b>50</b> is removed the hose is connected from the connection at valve <b>26</b> to the slops tank <b>41</b>. Valve <b>45</b> on the slops tank <b>41</b> is then opened, as is valve <b>26</b> (slowly) until fluid is heard to escape through the valve to the slops tank <b>41</b> (the valve will have to be unlocked first). The valve will reach extremely low temperatures while the fluid vents through it. The pressure and temperature in the slops tank <b>41</b> should be monitored at all times when <b>26</b> is open. The slops tank <b>41</b> pressure should be kept below 2.5 barg. If the temperature falls below −25° C. than valve <b>26</b> should be closed, and the temperature allowed to return to above −25° C. before valve <b>26</b> is opened again.</p>
    <p>Valve <b>22</b> is opened, then <b>120</b>, then <b>20</b>; this will vent the contents of bottle <b>10</b> to the slops tank <b>41</b>. The system will then be configured as shown in FIG. <b>10</b>. The pressure and temperature in the slops tank <b>41</b> is then monitored recorded and maintained within limits stated above.</p>
    <p>Valve <b>14</b> is opened and the water/glycol supply pump is connected to the connection point at <b>30</b>. Valves <b>22</b> and <b>120</b> are then closed.</p>
    <p>Valve <b>12</b> is then opened and water/glycol is pumped into the back of bottle <b>10</b>, checking that the piston <b>16</b> moves towards the front of the bottle <b>28</b>. Production fluid will be expelled through the connection at valve <b>26</b> into the slops tank <b>41</b> as shown in FIG. <b>11</b>.</p>
    <p>When the piston <b>16</b> reaches the front of bottle <b>10</b> valve <b>12</b> is closed. Valves <b>26</b> on the sampling skid and <b>45</b> on the slops tank <b>41</b> are then closed.</p>
    <p>At this point, the bottle <b>10</b> has been vented but the section of pipework between valves <b>119</b> and <b>114</b>, including bottle <b>110</b>, is still at pressure.</p>
    <p>The bottle <b>110</b> should now be removed. Before bottle <b>110</b> can be removed the pressure either side of the bottle must be vented, by closing valves <b>113</b> and <b>117</b>, backing off the plugs <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> and then depressing the cap to release any trapped pressure before removing the plugs. Valve <b>120</b> is closed, and the slops tank <b>41</b> hose is connected to the connection point <b>140</b>.</p>
    <p>Valves <b>45</b>, <b>119</b> and <b>118</b> are opened sequentially to vent the section of pipe between valves <b>117</b> and <b>20</b>. There should only be a small release of fluid from this small section of pipe. If there is continual fluid release and the pressure in the bottle falls then this indicates valve <b>117</b> is passing. Valves <b>118</b> and <b>119</b> should in that case be closed, and the bottle can only be removed if it is first completely vented to the slops tank <b>41</b>.</p>
    <p>Valves <b>45</b>, <b>118</b> and <b>119</b> are closed sequentially, and the hose to the slops tank <b>41</b> is disconnected from valve <b>118</b>.</p>
    <p>The fluid at the back end of bottle <b>110</b> will be at the hydrostatic water head pressure when the sample was taken (around 10 barg for 100 m depth). This pressure must be vented before the bottle can be removed.</p>
    <p>The slops tank <b>41</b> hose is connected to the connection <b>130</b>, and the valves <b>45</b> and <b>112</b> are opened. The bottle is still isolated by valve <b>113</b>. If the pressure in the bottle falls when valve <b>112</b> is opened then this indicates both the bottle piston seals and valve <b>113</b> are passing. In this case the bottle must be completely vented to the slops tank <b>41</b> before it can be removed. This should be done through valves <b>117</b> and <b>118</b>.</p>
    <p>Valves <b>111</b> and <b>114</b> are opened, and valve <b>45</b> on the slops tank <b>41</b> is closed before the hose <b>51</b> to the slops tank <b>41</b> is disconnected. Valves <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>118</b> and <b>119</b> are closed (Valves <b>113</b> and <b>117</b> should already be closed).</p>
    <p>Valves <b>120</b> and <b>26</b> are then opened to ensure both the points where the bottle connects to the skid are open to atmospheric pressure. Bottle <b>110</b> still contains production fluids at pressure and so should be handled with care. Bottle <b>110</b> is disconnected.</p>
    <p>A new bottle to be inserted should be pre-filled with the water glycol mix at the back of the sample bottle. The double block and bleed valves either side of the bottle should be closed. The piston should be at the front of the bottle and the pressure gauge should read zero. The new sampling bottle should then be fitted to the skid, checking that valve <b>119</b> connects to <b>120</b> and <b>111</b> connects to <b>114</b>.</p>
    <p>The pipework between the hot stab and the sampling bottles will have to be flushed through to prevent contamination between samples. De-mineralised water is preferably used for the flushing operation in order to avoid contamination of samples. Tp The skid valves should be configured as below:</p>

    <p>There are three legs of pipework on the skid that must be flushed through. The hot stab and check valve must be disconnected and flushed in the flow direction due to the presence of the check valve. Thus there are four sections to be flushed; labelled A, B, C and D on FIG. <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p>The de-mineralised water pump is connected to the connection point <b>140</b> as shown in FIG. 14, and a hose from the connection at valve <b>26</b> is connected to a suitable receptacle. Valves <b>26</b> and <b>120</b> are opened and the system should now be configured as shown in FIG. <b>14</b>. De-mineralised water is then pumped through the pipework, and fluid will exit from the hose at <b>26</b> to be collected in the receptacle. Pumping is continued until the fluid exiting <b>26</b> is clean, at which point valve <b>26</b> is closed, valve <b>20</b> is opened, and the hose is moved from <b>26</b> to <b>40</b>. Valve <b>18</b> is then opened and de-mineralised water is pumped through the pipework, with fluid draining from <b>18</b> and pumping continuing until the fluid exiting is clean. At that point, valves <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> are closed and valve <b>22</b> is opened, the hot stab and check valve are disconnected from the rest of the skid at the QC coupling.</p>
    <p>The hose is transferred from <b>30</b> to the QC coupling, and de-mineralised water is pumped through the pipework, draining through the hose at <b>22</b>, until clean, whereupon the water pump is disconnected from the skid, the hot stab is inserted into the dummy female receptacle, the water pump is connected to the connection on the female stab <b>34</b>, the hot stab sleeve <b>35</b> is opened by hydraulic pressure and de-mineralised water is pumped through the hot stab and check valve, until clean.</p>
    <p>The water pump is then disconnected from the female stab <b>34</b>, and valves <b>22</b> and <b>26</b> are closed.</p>
    <p>The skid pipework is then purged with nitrogen prior to each sampling run. This will be done to remove air from the pipework prior to the introduction of hydrocarbons.</p>
    <p>The nitrogen supply is connected to the connection point <b>140</b> as shown in FIG. <b>15</b>. Valves <b>26</b> and <b>120</b> are opened and the system should now be configured as shown in FIG. <b>15</b>.</p>
    <p>The nitrogen supply is opened and the system is purged through for a few seconds. Fluids will exit from the connection at <b>26</b>.</p>
    <p>Valve <b>26</b> is then closed, and valves <b>20</b> and <b>18</b> are opened. After a further nitrogen purge for a few seconds fluids will exit from the connection at <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p>Valves <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> are closed, and valve <b>22</b> is opened.</p>
    <p>After a further nitrogen purge, fluids will exit from the end of the hose where the check valve and stab are normally attached.</p>
    <p>Valves <b>22</b> and <b>118</b> are closed and the nitrogen supply is disconnected from the skid and connected to the connection on the female stab <b>34</b>.</p>
    <p>The hot stab sleeve <b>35</b> is opened by hydraulic pressure, purged with nitrogen for a few seconds and closed before the check valve and stab are re-connected to the skid pipework.</p>
    <p>Hydraulic pressure is then applied to open the hot stab sleeve <b>35</b>, and checking that valves <b>18</b>, <b>118</b> and <b>26</b> are closed, valves <b>22</b>, <b>120</b> and <b>20</b> are opened. The system should be configured as shown in FIG. <b>16</b>.</p>
    <p>A nitrogen purge is generally conducted in two steps to achieve a nitrogen purity of 99.9% of volume in the skid pipework. Typically the piping is filled with nitrogen to a pressure of 15 barg, and the nitrogen supply is isolated.</p>
    <p>Valve <b>26</b> is opened to vent the nitrogen, and then closed.</p>
    <p>The nitrogen supply is then opened and nitrogen fills the piping to a pressure of 15 barg, after which the nitrogen supply is isolated and the pipes are vented by opening and closing valve <b>26</b>.</p>
    <p>As the connections between bottle <b>110</b> and the rest of the pipework have been broken they must be re-tested before another sample can be taken as follows: the nitrogen supply is connected to the connection point at valve <b>118</b> and the nitrogen supply regulator is set to 125 barg. At this point the bottle piston <b>116</b> should be at the front <b>128</b> of bottle <b>110</b> and the bottle and piping behind the piston <b>116</b> should be filled with the water/glycol mix.</p>
    <p>The skid valves should be configured as follows and as shown in FIG. <b>17</b>.</p>

    <p>The above configuration will allow the piping between valve <b>120</b> and the sampling bottle piston <b>116</b> to be filled with nitrogen. The pressure in the pipework is shown on the bottle pressure gauge. As the piston <b>116</b> is free to move, the water/glycol mix at the back of the bottle will also be pressurised from the bottle piston <b>116</b> through to valve <b>114</b>. Thus both of the points where the bottle is connected into the skid will be tested. The bottle piston seal need not be tested, as this will have been done onshore. Only a small volume of nitrogen will be required to test the piping. Thus the pressure in the piping will rise quickly when the nitrogen supply is opened.</p>
    <p>Soapy water is applied around the bottle connection point adjacent to valve <b>20</b> to detect leaks. The connection at the rear of the bottle should be dried.</p>
    <p>The nitrogen pressure is gradually increased to a pressure of 125 barg. The bottle piston <b>116</b> should not move a significant amount during the test. If the piston continues to move during pressurising then this indicates a leak from the piping at the back end of the bottle.</p>
    <p>The nitrogen supply is closed by valve <b>118</b> and disconnected, and the system is left pressurised for 30 minutes. Assuming no leaks valve <b>118</b> is opened to vent off the nitrogen.</p>
    <p>Once all sampling operations are complete the sampling skid can be disconnected from the ROV 200. The skid itself should not contain any fluids at pressure. The only fluids at pressure will be within the sample bottles.</p>
    <p>The hydraulic supply lines to the sampling skid valves are vented to atmospheric pressure, disconnected and stored in the transportation case.</p>
    <p>All electrical supply and control cables are disconnected between the ROV 200 and the skid, any hydraulic or electrical ports on the skid are capped to prevent debris ingress. All valves are closed and pressure caps are fitted on the outlets of valves <b>26</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>118</b>. The flexible pipe from the safety relief valve on the slops tank <b>41</b> should be checked for security and left in place until the slops tank <b>41</b> is demobilised from the vessel.</p>
    <p>Before storage the valves <b>46</b> and <b>47</b> should be closed and valve opened. The outlet ports from all valves should be left clear so that leaks past the valves can be detected. A final leak test is then carried out by filling the tank with nitrogen through the connection point at valve <b>45</b> to a test pressure of 2.5 barg for 10 minutes, after which the valve <b>45</b> is closed and the nitrogen supply is disconnected. The pressure and temperature are monitored over a period of 30 minutes, and a soapy solution is applied to all flange joints and valve body joints to check for leaks. If there is leakage it will most likely be past the valves or from the flanged connection on the vessel. The flanged connections may have to be re-assembled or the valves refurbished/replaced.</p>
    <p>The nitrogen can be vented by opening valve <b>46</b>. A slight positive pressure of 0.1 barg is preferably maintained within the vessel.</p>
    <p>Modifications and improvements can be incorporated without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
