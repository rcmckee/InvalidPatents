No. 11/004,561 filed Dec. 3, 2004, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/527,323 filed Dec. 5, 2003; U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/587,787 filed Jul. 13, 2004; and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/614,683 filed Sep. 30, 2004. All above-referenced prior applications are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">The present invention relates generally to systems and methods for processing analyte sensor data.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0004">Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the pancreas cannot create sufficient insulin (Type I or insulin dependent) and/or in which insulin is not effective (Type 2 or non-insulin dependent). In the diabetic state, the victim suffers from high blood sugar, which may cause an array of physiological derangements (for example, kidney failure, skin ulcers, or bleeding into the vitreous of the eye) associated with the deterioration of small blood vessels. A hypoglycemic reaction (low blood sugar) may be induced by an inadvertent overdose of insulin, or after a normal dose of insulin or glucose-lowering agent accompanied by extraordinary exercise or insufficient food intake.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">Conventionally, a diabetic person carries a self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) monitor, which typically comprises uncomfortable finger pricking methods. Due to the lack of comfort and convenience, a diabetic will normally only measure his or her glucose level two to four times per day. Unfortunately, these time intervals are so far spread apart that the diabetic will likely find out too late, sometimes incurring dangerous side effects, of a hyper- or hypo-glycemic condition. In fact, it is not only unlikely that a diabetic will take a timely SMBG value, but the diabetic will not know if their blood glucose value is going up (higher) or down (lower) based on conventional methods, inhibiting their ability to make educated insulin therapy decisions.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0006">A variety of continuous glucose sensors have been developed for detecting and/or quantifying glucose concentration in a host. These sensors have typically required one or more blood glucose measurements, or the like, from which to calibrate the continuous glucose sensor to calculate the relationship between the current output of the sensor and blood glucose measurements, to provide meaningful values to a patient or doctor. Unfortunately, continuous glucose sensors are conventionally also sensitive to non-glucose related changes in the baseline current and sensitivity over time, for example, due to changes in a host's metabolism, maturation of the tissue at the biointerface of the sensor, interfering species which cause a measurable increase or decrease in the signal, or the like. Therefore, in addition to initial calibration, continuous glucose sensors should be responsive to baseline and/or sensitivity changes over time, which requires recalibration of the sensor. Consequently, users of continuous glucose sensors have typically been required to obtain numerous blood glucose measurements daily and/or weekly in order to maintain calibration of the sensor over time.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">The preferred embodiments provide improved calibration techniques that utilize electrode systems and signal processing that provides measurements useful in simplifying and updating calibration that allows the patient increased convenience (for example, by requiring fewer reference glucose values) and confidence (for example, by increasing accuracy of the device).</p>

    <p num="h-0008">Overview</p>
    <p num="p-0062">The preferred embodiments provide a continuous analyte sensor that measures a concentration of the analyte of interest or a substance indicative of the concentration or presence of the analyte. In some embodiments, the analyte sensor is an invasive, minimally invasive, or non-invasive device, for example a subcutaneous, transdermal, or intravascular device. In some embodiments, the analyte sensor may analyze a plurality of intermittent biological samples. The analyte sensor may use any method of analyte-measurement, including enzymatic, chemical, physical, electrochemical, spectrophotometric, polarimetric, calorimetric, radiometric, or the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0063">In general, analyte sensors provide at least one working electrode and at least one reference electrode, which are configured to measure a signal associated with a concentration of the analyte in the host, such as described in more detail below, and as appreciated by one skilled in the art. The output signal is typically a raw data stream that is used to provide a useful value of the measured analyte concentration in a host to the patient or doctor, for example. However, the analyte sensors of the preferred embodiments may further measure at least one additional signal associated with the baseline and/or sensitivity of the analyte sensor, thereby enabling monitoring of baseline and/or sensitivity changes that may occur in a continuous analyte sensor over time.</p>
    <p num="p-0064">In general, continuous analyte sensors define a relationship between sensor-generated measurements (for example, current in nA or digital counts after A/D conversion) and a reference measurement (for example, mg/dL or mmol/L) that are meaningful to a user (for example, patient or doctor). In the case of an implantable enzyme-based electrochemical glucose sensors, the sensing mechanism generally depends on phenomena that are linear with glucose concentration, for example: (1) diffusion of glucose through a membrane system (for example, biointerface membrane and membrane system) situated between implantation site and the electrode surface, (2) an enzymatic reaction within the membrane system (for example, membrane system), and (3) diffusion of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>to the sensor. Because of this linearity, calibration of the sensor can be understood by solving an equation:
<br> <i>y=mx+b </i> <br>
where y represents the sensor signal (counts), x represents the estimated glucose concentration (mg/dL), m represents the sensor sensitivity to glucose (counts/mg/dL), and b represents the baseline signal (counts). Because both sensitivity m and baseline b change over time in vivo, calibration has conventionally required at least two independent, matched data pairs (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>; x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>) to solve for m and b and thus allow glucose estimation when only the sensor signal, y is available. Matched data pairs can be created by matching reference data (for example, one or more reference glucose data points from a blood glucose meter, or the like) with substantially time corresponding sensor data (for example, one or more glucose sensor data points) to provide one or more matched data pairs, such as described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/633,367, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
</p>
    <p num="p-0065">Accordingly, in some embodiments, the sensing region is configured to measure changes in sensitivity of the analyte sensor over time, which can be used to trigger calibration, update calibration, avoid inaccurate calibration (for example, calibration during unstable periods), and/or trigger filtering of the sensor data. Namely, the analyte sensor is configured to measure a signal associated with a non-analyte constant in the host. Preferably, the non-analyte constant signal is measured beneath the membrane system on the sensor. In one example of a glucose sensor, a non-glucose constant that can be measured is oxygen, wherein a measured change in oxygen transport is indicative of a change in the sensitivity of the glucose signal, which can be measured by switching the bias potential of the working electrode, an auxiliary oxygen-measuring electrode, an oxygen sensor, or the like, as described in more detail elsewhere herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0066">Alternatively or additionally, in some embodiments, the sensing region is configured to measure changes in the amount of background noise (baseline) in the signal, which can be used to trigger calibration, update calibration, avoid inaccurate calibration (for example, calibration during unstable periods), and/or trigger filtering of the sensor data. In one example of a glucose sensor, the baseline is composed substantially of signal contribution due to factors other than glucose (for example, interfering species, non-reaction-related hydrogen peroxide, or other electroactive species with an oxidation potential that overlaps with hydrogen peroxide). Namely, the glucose sensor is configured to measure a signal associated with the baseline (all non-glucose related current generated) measured by sensor in the host. In some embodiments, an auxiliary electrode located beneath a non-enzymatic portion of the membrane system is used to measure the baseline signal. In some embodiments, the baseline signal is subtracted from the glucose signal (which includes the baseline) to obtain the signal contribution substantially only due to glucose. Subtraction may be accomplished electronically in the sensor using a differential amplifier, digitally in the receiver, and/or otherwise in the hardware or software of the sensor or receiver as is appreciated by one skilled in the art, and as described in more detail elsewhere herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0067">One skilled in the art appreciates that the above-described sensitivity and baseline signal measurements can be combined to benefit from both measurements in a single analyte sensor.</p>

In one embodiment, the membrane system generally provides one or more of the following functions: 1) protection of the exposed electrode surface from the biological environment, 2) diffusion resistance (limitation) of the analyte, 3) a catalyst for enabling an enzymatic reaction, 4) limitation or blocking of interfering species, and 5) hydrophilicity at the electrochemically reactive surfaces of the sensor interface, such as described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/838,912, filed May 3, 2004 and entitled “IMPLANTABLE ANALYTE SENSOR,” which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Accordingly, the membrane system <b>22</b> preferably includes a plurality of domains or layers, for example, resistance domain <b>30</b>, an interference domain <b>28</b>, an enzyme domain <b>26</b> (for example, glucose oxidase), an electrolyte domain <b>24</b>, and may additionally include a cell disruptive domain, a cell impermeable domain, and/or an oxygen domain (not shown), such as described in more detail in the above-cited U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/838,912. However, it is understood that a membrane system modified for other sensors, for example, by including fewer or additional domains is within the scope of the preferred embodiments.</p>
    <p num="p-0085">In some embodiments, the domains of the biointerface and membrane systems are formed from materials such as silicone, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyethylene-co-tetrafluoroethylene, polyolefin, polyester, polycarbonate, biostable polytetrafluoroethylene, homopolymers, copolymers, terpolymers of polyurethanes, polypropylene (PP), polyvinylchloride (PVC), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polyether ether ketone (PEEK), polyurethanes, cellulosic polymers, polysulfones and block copolymers thereof including, for example, di-block, tri-block, alternating, random and graft copolymers. Co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/838,912, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes biointerface and membrane system configurations and materials that may be applied to the preferred embodiments.</p>
    <p num="p-0086"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> are schematic views membrane systems in some embodiments that may be disposed over the electroactive surfaces of an analyte sensors of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, respectively, wherein the membrane system includes one or more of the following domains: a resistance domain <b>30</b>, an enzyme domain <b>28</b>, an interference domain <b>26</b>, and an electrolyte domain <b>24</b>, such as described in more detail below. However, it is understood that the membrane system <b>22</b> can be modified for use in other sensors, by including only one or more of the domains, additional domains not recited above, or for other sensor configurations. For example, the interference domain can be removed when other methods for removing interferants are utilized, such as an auxiliary electrode for measuring and subtracting out signal due to interferants. As another example, an “oxygen antenna domain” composed of a material that has higher oxygen solubility than aqueous media so that it concentrates oxygen from the biological fluid surrounding the biointerface membrane can be added. The oxygen antenna domain can then act as an oxygen source during times of minimal oxygen availability and has the capacity to provide on demand a higher rate of oxygen delivery to facilitate oxygen transport to the membrane. This enhances function in the enzyme reaction domain and at the counter electrode surface when glucose conversion to hydrogen peroxide in the enzyme domain consumes oxygen from the surrounding domains. Thus, this ability of the oxygen antenna domain to apply a higher flux of oxygen to critical domains when needed improves overall sensor function.</p>
    <p num="h-0011">Electrolyte Domain</p>
    <p num="p-0087">In some preferred embodiments, an electrolyte domain <b>24</b> is provided to ensure an electrochemical reaction occurs at the electroactive surfaces. Preferably, the electrolyte domain includes a semipermeable coating that maintains hydrophilicity at the electrochemically reactive surfaces of the sensor interface. The electrolyte domain enhances the stability of the interference domain <b>26</b> by protecting and supporting the material that makes up the interference domain. The electrolyte domain also assists in stabilizing the operation of the sensor by overcoming electrode start-up problems and drifting problems caused by inadequate electrolyte. The buffered electrolyte solution contained in the electrolyte domain also protects against pH-mediated damage that can result from the formation of a large pH gradient between the substantially hydrophobic interference domain and the electrodes due to the electrochemical activity of the electrodes. In one embodiment, the electrolyte domain <b>24</b> includes a flexible, water-swellable, substantially solid gel-like film.</p>
    <p num="h-0012">Interference Domain</p>
    <p num="p-0088">Interferants are molecules or other species that are electro-reduced or electro-oxidized at the electrochemically reactive surfaces, either directly or via an electron transfer agent, to produce a false signal. In one embodiment, the interference domain <b>26</b> prevents the penetration of one or more interferants (for example, urate, ascorbate, or acetaminophen) into the electrolyte phase around the electrochemically reactive surfaces. Preferably, this type of interference domain is much less permeable to one or more of the interferants than to the analyte.</p>
    <p num="p-0089">In one embodiment, the interference domain <b>26</b> can include ionic components incorporated into a polymeric matrix to reduce the permeability of the interference domain to ionic interferants having the same charge as the ionic components. In another embodiment, the interference domain <b>26</b> includes a catalyst (for example, peroxidase) for catalyzing a reaction that removes interferants. U.S. Pat. No. 6,413,396 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,565,509 disclose methods and materials for eliminating interfering species. However, in the preferred embodiments any suitable method or material can be employed.</p>
    <p num="p-0090">In one embodiment, the interference domain <b>26</b> includes a thin membrane that is designed to limit diffusion of species, e.g., those greater than 34 g/mol in molecular weight, for example. The interference domain permits analytes and other substances (for example, hydrogen peroxide) that are to be measured by the electrodes to pass through, while preventing passage of other substances, such as potentially interfering substances. In one embodiment, the interference domain <b>26</b> is constructed of polyurethane.</p>
    <p num="h-0013">Enzyme Domain</p>
    <p num="p-0091">In the preferred embodiments, the enzyme domain <b>28</b> provides a catalyst to catalyze the reaction of the analyte and its co-reactant, as described in greater detail above. In preferred embodiments, the enzyme domain includes glucose oxidase. However other oxidases, for example, galactose oxidase or uricase, can be used.</p>
    <p num="p-0092">For example, enzyme-based electrochemical analyte sensor performance at least partially depends on a response that is neither limited by enzyme activity nor cofactor concentration. Because enzymes, including glucose oxidase, are subject to deactivation as a function of ambient conditions, this behavior needs to be accounted for in constructing analyte sensors. Preferably, the domain is constructed of aqueous dispersions of colloidal polyurethane polymers including the enzyme. However, some alternative embodiments construct the enzyme domain from an oxygen antenna material, for example, silicone or fluorocarbons, in order to provide a supply of excess oxygen during transient ischemia. Preferably, the enzyme is immobilized within the domain, as is appreciated by one skilled in the art.</p>
    <p num="h-0014">Resistance Domain</p>
    <p num="p-0093">The resistance domain <b>30</b> includes a semipermeable membrane that controls the flux of analytes of interest (for example, glucose and oxygen) to the underlying enzyme domain <b>28</b>. As a result, the upper limit of linearity of an analyte measurement can be extended to a much higher value than what can be achieved without the resistance domain. In one embodiment of a glucose sensor, the resistance domain <b>38</b> exhibits an oxygen-to-glucose permeability ratio of approximately 200:1. As a result, one-dimensional reactant diffusion is adequate to provide excess oxygen at all reasonable glucose and oxygen concentrations found in the subcutaneous matrix (See Rhodes et al., Anal. Chem., 66:1520-1529 (1994)).</p>
    <p num="p-0094">In some alternative embodiments, a lower ratio of oxygen-to-glucose can be sufficient to provide excess oxygen by using an oxygen antenna domain (for example, a silicone or fluorocarbon based material or domain) to enhance the supply/transport of oxygen to the enzyme domain. In other words, if more oxygen is supplied to the enzyme, then more glucose can also be supplied to the enzyme without the rate of this reaction being limited by a lack of glucose. In some alternative embodiments, the resistance domain is formed from a silicone composition, such as described in copending U.S. application Ser. No. 10/685,636 filed Oct. 28, 2003, and entitled, “SILICONE COMPOSITION FOR BIOCOMPATIBLE MEMBRANE,” which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
    <p num="p-0095">In one preferred embodiment, the resistance layer includes a homogenous polyurethane membrane with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions to control the diffusion of glucose and oxygen to an analyte sensor, the membrane being fabricated easily and reproducibly from commercially available materials. In preferred embodiments, the thickness of the resistance domain is from about 10 microns or less to about 200 microns or more.</p>
    <p num="p-0096">The above-described domains are exemplary and are not meant to be limiting to the following description, for example, their systems and methods are designed for the exemplary enzyme-based electrochemical sensor embodiment.</p>

In this embodiment, the membrane system is formed such that the glucose oxidase <b>32</b> only exists above the glucose-measuring working electrode <b>16</b>. In one embodiment, during the preparation of the membrane system <b>22</b>, the enzyme domain coating solution can be applied as a circular region similar to the diameter of the glucose-measuring working electrode <b>16</b>. This fabrication can be accomplished in a variety of ways such as screen-printing or pad printing. Preferably, the enzyme domain is pad printed during the enzyme domain fabrication with equipment as available from Pad Print Machinery of Vermont (Manchester, Vt.). This embodiment provides the active enzyme <b>32</b> above the glucose-measuring working electrode <b>16</b> only, so that the glucose-measuring working electrode <b>16</b> (and not the auxiliary working electrode <b>18</b>) measures glucose concentration. Additionally, this embodiment provides an added advantage of eliminating the consumption of O<sub>2 </sub>above the counter electrode (if applicable) by the oxidation of glucose with glucose oxidase.</p>

In one alternative embodiment, the enzyme of the membrane system <b>22</b> may be deactivated <b>34</b> everywhere except for the area covering the glucose-measuring working electrode <b>16</b> or may be selectively deactivated only over certain areas (for example, auxiliary working electrode <b>18</b>, counter electrode <b>22</b>, and/or reference electrode <b>20</b>) by irradiation, or the like. In such a case, a mask (for example, such as those used for photolithography) can be placed above the membrane that covers the glucose-measuring working electrode <b>16</b>. In this way, exposure of the masked membrane to ultraviolet light deactivates the glucose oxidase in all regions except that covered by the mask.</p>

    <p num="h-0018">Calibration Systems and Methods</p>
    <p num="p-0116">As described above in the Overview Section, continuous analyte sensors define a relationship between sensor-generated measurements and a reference measurement that is meaningful to a user (for example, blood glucose in mg/dL). This defined relationship must be monitored to ensure that the continuous analyte sensor maintains a substantially accurate calibration and thereby continually provides meaningful values to a user. Unfortunately, both sensitivity m and baseline b of the calibration are subject to changes that occur in vivo over time (for example, hours to months), requiring updates to the calibration. Generally, any physical property that influences diffusion or transport of molecules through the membrane can alter the sensitivity (and/or baseline) of the calibration. Physical properties that can alter the transport of molecules include, but are not limited to, blockage of surface area due to foreign body giant cells and other barrier cells at the biointerface, distance of capillaries from the membrane, foreign body response/capsule, disease, tissue ingrowth, thickness of membrane system, or the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0117">In one example of a change in transport of molecules, an implantable glucose sensor is implanted in the subcutaneous space of a human, which is at least partially covered with a biointerface membrane, such as described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/647,065, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Although the body's natural response to a foreign object is to encapsulate the sensor, the architecture of this biointerface membrane encourages tissue ingrowth and neo-vascularization over time, providing transport of solutes (for example, glucose and oxygen) close to the membrane that covers the electrodes. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that ingrowth of vascularized tissue matures (changes) over time, beginning with a short period of high solute transport during the first few days after implantation, continuing through a time period of significant tissue ingrowth a few days to a week or more after implantation during which low solute transport to the membrane has been observed, and into a mature state of vascularized tissue during which the bed of vascularized tissue provides moderate to high solute transport, which can last for months and even longer after implantation. In some embodiments, this maturation process accounts for a substantial portion of the change in sensitivity and/or baseline of the calibration over time due to changes in solute transport to the membrane.</p>
    <p num="p-0118">Accordingly, in one aspect of the preferred embodiments, systems and methods are provided for measuring changes in sensitivity, also referred to as changes in solute transport or biointerface changes, of an analyte sensor <b>10</b> implanted in a host over a time period. Preferably, the sensitivity measurement is a signal obtained by measuring a constant analyte other than the analyte being measured by the analyte sensor. For example, in a glucose sensor, a non-glucose constant analyte is measured, wherein the signal is measured beneath the membrane system <b>22</b> on the glucose sensor <b>10</b>. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that by monitoring the sensitivity over a time period, a change associated with solute transport through the membrane system <b>22</b> can be measured and used as an indication of a sensitivity change in the analyte measurement. In other words, a biointerface monitor is provided, which is capable of monitoring changes in the biointerface surrounding an implantable device, thereby enabling the measurement of sensitivity changes of an analyte sensor over time.</p>
    <p num="p-0119">In some embodiments, the analyte sensor <b>10</b> is provided with an auxiliary electrode <b>18</b> configured as a transport-measuring electrode disposed beneath the membrane system <b>22</b>. The transport-measuring electrode can be configured to measure any of a number of substantially constant analytes or factors, such that a change measured by the transport-measuring electrode can be used to indicate a change in solute (for example, glucose) transport to the membrane system <b>22</b>. Some examples of substantially constant analytes or factors that can be measured include, but are not limited to, oxygen, carboxylic acids (such as urea), amino acids, hydrogen, pH, chloride, baseline, or the like. Thus, the transport-measuring electrode provides an independent measure of changes in solute transport to the membrane, and thus sensitivity changes over time.</p>
    <p num="p-0120">In some embodiments, the transport-measuring electrode measures analytes similar to the analyte being measured by the analyte sensor. For example, in some embodiments of a glucose sensor, water soluble analytes are believed to better represent the changes in sensitivity to glucose over time than non-water soluble analytes (due to the water-solubility of glucose), however relevant information may be ascertained from a variety of molecules. Although some specific examples are described herein, one skilled in the art appreciates a variety of implementations of sensitivity measurements that can be used as to qualify or quantify solute transport through the biointerface of the analyte sensor.</p>
    <p num="p-0121">In one embodiment of a glucose sensor, the transport-measuring electrode is configured to measure urea, which is a water-soluble constant analyte that is known to react directly or indirectly at a hydrogen peroxide sensing electrode (similar to the working electrode of the glucose sensor example described in more detail above). In one exemplary implementation wherein urea is directly measured by the transport-measuring electrode, the glucose sensor comprises a membrane system as described in more detail above, however, does not include an active interference domain or active enzyme directly above the transport-measuring electrode, thereby allowing the urea to pass through the membrane system to the electroactive surface for measurement thereon. In one alternative exemplary implementation wherein urea is indirectly measured by the transport-measuring electrode, the glucose sensor comprises a membrane system as described in more detail above, and further includes an active uricase oxidase domain located directly above the transport-measuring electrode, thereby allowing the urea to react at the enzyme and produce hydrogen peroxide, which can be measured at the electroactive surface thereon.</p>
    <p num="p-0122">In some embodiments, the change in sensitivity is measured by measuring a change in oxygen concentration, which can be used to provide an independent measurement of the maturation of the biointerface, and to indicate when recalibration of the system may be advantageous. In one alternative embodiment, oxygen is measured using pulsed amperometric detection on the glucose-measuring working electrode <b>16</b> (eliminating the need for a separate auxiliary electrode). In another embodiment, the auxiliary electrode is configured as an oxygen-measuring electrode. In another embodiment, an oxygen sensor (not shown) is added to the glucose sensor, as is appreciated by one skilled in the art, eliminating the need for an auxiliary electrode.</p>
    <p num="p-0123">In some embodiments, a stability module is provided, wherein the sensitivity measurement changes can be quantified such that a co-analyte concentration threshold is determined. A co-analyte threshold is generally defined as a minimum amount of co-analyte required to fully react with the analyte in an enzyme-based analyte sensor in a non-limiting manner. The minimum co-analyte threshold is preferably expressed as a ratio (for example, a glucose-to-oxygen ratio) that defines a concentration of co-analyte required based on a concentration of analyte available to ensure that the enzyme reaction is limited only by the analyte. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that by determining a stability of the analyte sensor based on a co-analyte threshold, the processor module can be configured to compensate for instabilities in the glucose sensor accordingly, for example by filtering the unstable data, suspending calibration or display, or the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0124">In one such embodiment, a data stream from an analyte signal is monitored and a co-analyte threshold set, whereby the co-analyte threshold is determined based on a signal-to-noise ratio exceeding a predetermined threshold. In one embodiment, the signal-to-noise threshold is based on measurements of variability and the sensor signal over a time period, however one skilled in the art appreciates the variety of systems and methods available for measuring signal-to-noise ratios. Accordingly, the stability module can be configured to set determine the stability of the analyte sensor based on the co-analyte threshold, or the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0125">In some embodiments, the stability module is configured to prohibit calibration of the sensor responsive to the stability (or instability) of the sensor. In some embodiments, the stability module can be configured to trigger filtering of the glucose signal responsive to a stability (or instability) of the sensor.</p>
    <p num="p-0126">In some embodiments, sensitivity changes can be used to trigger a request for one or more new reference glucose values from the host, which can be used to recalibrate the sensor. In some embodiments, the sensor is re-calibrated responsive to a sensitivity change exceeding a preselected threshold value. In some embodiments, the sensor is calibrated repeatedly at a frequency responsive to the measured sensitivity change. Using these techniques, patient inconvenience can be minimized because reference glucose values are generally only requested when timely and appropriate (namely, when a sensitivity or baseline shift is diagnosed).</p>
    <p num="p-0127">In some alternative embodiments, sensitivity changes can be used to update calibration. For example, the measured change in transport can be used to update the sensitivity m in the calibration equation. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that in some embodiments, the sensitivity m of the calibration of the glucose sensor is substantially proportional to the change in solute transport measured by the transport-measuring electrode.</p>
    <p num="p-0128">It should be appreciated by one skilled in the art that in some embodiments, the implementation of sensitivity measurements of the preferred embodiments typically necessitate an addition to, or modification of, the existing electronics (for example, potentiostat configuration or settings) of the glucose sensor and/or receiver.</p>
    <p num="p-0129">In some embodiments, the signal from the oxygen measuring electrode may be digitally low-pass filtered (for example, with a passband of 0-10<sup>−5 </sup>Hz, dc-24 hour cycle lengths) to remove transient fluctuations in oxygen, due to local ischemia, postural effects, periods of apnea, or the like. Since oxygen delivery to tissues is held in tight homeostatic control, this filtered oxygen signal should oscillate about a relatively constant. In the interstitial fluid, it is thought that the levels are about equivalent with venous blood (40 mmHg). Once implanted, changes in the mean of the oxygen signal (for example, &gt;5%) may be indicative of change in transport through the biointerface (change in sensor sensitivity and/or baseline due to changes in solute transport) and the need for system recalibration.</p>
    <p num="p-0130">The oxygen signal may also be used in its unfiltered or a minimally filtered form to detect or predict oxygen deprivation-induced artifact in the glucose signal, and to control display of data to the user, or the method of smoothing, digital filtering, or otherwise replacement of glucose signal artifact. In some embodiments, the oxygen sensor may be implemented in conjunction with any signal artifact detection or prediction that may be performed on the counter electrode or working electrode voltage signals of the electrode system. Co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/648,849, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein, describes some methods of signal artifact detection and replacement that may be useful such as described herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0131">Preferably, the transport-measuring electrode is located within the same local environment as the electrode system associated with the measurement of glucose, such that the transport properties at the transport-measuring electrode are substantially similar to the transport properties at the glucose-measuring electrode.</p>
    <p num="p-0132">In a second aspect the preferred embodiments, systems and methods are provided for measuring changes baseline, namely non-glucose related electroactive compounds in the host. Preferably the auxiliary working electrode is configured to measure the baseline of the analyte sensor over time. In some embodiments, the glucose-measuring working electrode <b>16</b> is a hydrogen peroxide sensor coupled to a membrane system <b>22</b> containing an active enzyme <b>32</b> located above the electrode (such as described in more detail with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>, above). In some embodiments, the auxiliary working electrode <b>18</b> is another hydrogen peroxide sensor that is configured similar to the glucose-measuring working electrode however a portion <b>34</b> of the membrane system <b>22</b> above the base-measuring electrode does not have active enzyme therein, such as described in more detail with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>. The auxiliary working electrode <b>18</b> provides a signal substantially comprising the baseline signal, b, which can be (for example, electronically or digitally) subtracted from the glucose signal obtained from the glucose-measuring working electrode to obtain the signal contribution due to glucose only according to the following equation:
<br>Signal<sub>glucose only</sub>=Signal<sub>glucose-measuring working electrode</sub>−Signal<sub>baseline-measuring working electrode </sub> </p>
    <p num="p-0133">In some embodiments, electronic subtraction of the baseline signal from the glucose signal can be performed in the hardware of the sensor, for example using a differential amplifier. In some alternative embodiments, digital subtraction of the baseline signal from the glucose signal can be performed in the software or hardware of the sensor or an associated receiver, for example in the microprocessor.</p>
    <p num="p-0134">One aspect the preferred embodiments provides for a simplified calibration technique, wherein the variability of the baseline has been eliminated (namely, subtracted). Namely, calibration of the resultant differential signal (Signal<sub>glucose only</sub>) can be performed with a single matched data pair by solving the following equation:
<br>y=mx</p>
    <p num="p-0135">While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that by calibrating using this simplified technique, the sensor is made less dependent on the range of values of the matched data pairs, which can be sensitive to human error in manual blood glucose measurements, for example. Additionally, by subtracting the baseline at the sensor (rather than solving for the baseline b as in conventional calibration schemes), accuracy of the sensor may increase by altering control of this variable (baseline b) from the user to the sensor. It is additionally believed that variability introduced by sensor calibration may be reduced.</p>
    <p num="p-0136">In some embodiments, the glucose-measuring working electrode <b>16</b> is a hydrogen peroxide sensor coupled to a membrane system <b>22</b> containing an active enzyme <b>32</b> located above the electrode, such as described in more detail above; however the baseline signal is not subtracted from the glucose signal for calibration of the sensor. Rather, multiple matched data pairs are obtained in order to calibrate the sensor (for example using y=mx+b) in a conventional manner, and the auxiliary working electrode <b>18</b> is used as an indicator of baseline shifts in the sensor signal. Namely, the auxiliary working electrode <b>18</b> is monitored for changes above a certain threshold. When a significant change is detected, the system can trigger a request (for example, from the patient or caregiver) for a new reference glucose value (for example, SMBG), which can be used to recalibrate the sensor. By using the auxiliary working electrode signal as an indicator of baseline shifts, recalibration requiring user interaction (namely, new reference glucose values) can be minimized due to timeliness and appropriateness of the requests. In some embodiments, the sensor is re-calibrated responsive to a baseline shifts exceeding a preselected threshold value. In some embodiments, the sensor is calibrated repeatedly at a frequency responsive to the rate-of-change of the baseline.</p>
    <p num="p-0137">In yet another alternative embodiment, the electrode system of the preferred embodiments is employed as described above, including determining the differential signal of glucose less baseline current in order to calibrate using the simplified equation (y=mx), and the auxiliary working electrode <b>18</b> is further utilized as an indicator of baseline shifts in the sensor signal. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that shifts in baseline may also correlate and/or be related to changes in the sensitivity m of the glucose signal. Consequently, a shift in baseline may be indicative of a change in sensitivity m. Therefore, the auxiliary working electrode <b>18</b> is monitored for changes above a certain threshold. When a significant change is detected, the system can trigger a request (for example, from the patient or caregiver) for a new reference glucose value (for example, SMBG), which can be used to recalibrate the sensor. By using the auxiliary signal as an indicator of possible sensitivity changes, recalibration requiring user interaction (new reference glucose values) can be minimized due to timeliness and appropriateness of the requests.</p>
    <p num="p-0138">It is noted that infrequent new matching data pairs may be useful over time to recalibrate the sensor because the sensitivity m of the sensor may change over time (for example, due to maturation of the biointerface that may increase or decrease the glucose and/or oxygen availability to the sensor). However, the baseline shifts that have conventionally required numerous and/or regular blood glucose reference measurements for updating calibration (for example, due to interfering species, metabolism changes, or the like) can be consistently and accurately eliminated using the systems and methods of the preferred embodiments, allowing reduced interaction from the patient (for example, requesting less frequent reference glucose values such as daily or even as infrequently as monthly).</p>
    <p num="p-0139">An additional advantage of the sensor of the preferred embodiments includes providing a method of eliminating signal effects of interfering species, which have conventionally been problematic in electrochemical glucose sensors. Namely, electrochemical sensors are subject to electrochemical reaction not only with the hydrogen peroxide (or other analyte to be measured), but additionally may react with other electroactive species that are not intentionally being measured (for example, interfering species), which cause an increase in signal strength due to this interference. In other words, interfering species are compounds with an oxidation potential that overlap with the analyte being measured. Interfering species such as acetaminophen, ascorbate, and urate, are notorious in the art of glucose sensors for producing inaccurate signal strength when they are not properly controlled. Some glucose sensors utilize a membrane system that blocks at least some interfering species, such as ascorbate and urate. Unfortunately, it is difficult to find membranes that are satisfactory or reliable in use, especially in vivo, which effectively block all interferants and/or interfering species. The prior art is crowded with literature dedicated to efforts toward reducing or eliminating interfering species (for example, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,776,944, U.S. Pat. No. 5,356,786, U.S. Pat. No. 5,593,852, U.S. Pat. No. 5,776,324B1, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,356,776).</p>
    <p num="p-0140">The preferred embodiments are particularly advantageous in their inherent ability to eliminate the erroneous transient and non-transient signal effects normally caused by interfering species. For example, if an interferant such as acetaminophen is ingested by a host implanted with a conventional implantable electrochemical glucose sensor (namely, one without means for eliminating acetaminophen), a transient non-glucose related increase in signal output would occur. However, by utilizing the electrode system of the preferred embodiments, both working electrodes respond with substantially equivalent increased current generation due to oxidation of the acetaminophen, which would be eliminated by subtraction of the auxiliary electrode signal from the glucose-measuring electrode signal.</p>
    <p num="p-0141">In summary, the system and methods of the preferred embodiments simplify the computation processes of calibration, decreases the susceptibility introduced by user error in calibration, and eliminates the effects of interfering species. Accordingly, the sensor requires less interaction by the patient (for example, less frequent calibration), increases patient convenience (for example, few reference glucose values), and improves accuracy (via simple and reliable calibration).</p>
    <p num="p-0142">In another aspect of the preferred embodiments, the analyte sensor is configured to measure any combination of changes in baseline and/or in sensitivity, simultaneously and/or iteratively, using any of the above-described systems and methods. While not wishing to be bound by theory, the preferred embodiments provide for improved calibration of the sensor, increased patient convenience through less frequent patient interaction with the sensor, less dependence on the values/range of the paired measurements, less sensitivity to error normally found in manual reference glucose measurements, adaptation to the maturation of the biointerface over time, elimination of erroneous signal due to interfering species, and/or self-diagnosis of the calibration for more intelligent recalibration of the sensor.</p>
