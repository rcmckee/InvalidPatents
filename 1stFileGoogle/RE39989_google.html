A method selects the telephone line interface which either connects to the telephone line, the satellite system or the wireless telephone, and another method bypasses the telephone line interface, selects and controls radio frequency telemetry modules or packet radios. The operation of the digital communications path-controller is divided into three modes comprising a command mode, a digital mode and an escape mode. The software is a set of digital communication protocols which provide error-free communication of digital and define a file transfer protocol at the application layer, the session protocol and the link protocol.</div>

  <heading>DESCRIPTION</heading> <p num="p-0004">1. Technical Field</p>
  <p num="p-0005">The present invention relates in general to the control, transmission and reception of standard data, fax data and voice signals. More particularly, but not by way of limitation, it relates to a distinct method and apparatus of the auto-selecting and auto-routing of either standard data, fax data or voice communication over a cellular telephone system, a radio frequency (RF) network, a satellite system or telephone line service or a combination of communication services.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">2. Background Art</p>
  <p num="p-0007">In recent years, with the increased emphasis on and use of portable or laptop computers and the availability of the cellular telephone system, radio frequency networks and satellite systems, more and more people are finding the need for, and the desirability of combining the portable or laptop computer with radio frequency networks, cellular telephone systems, satellite systems and conventional telephone line service to not only send and receive voice signals but to send and receive digital standard data and fax data between remote sites.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">It is well known to send digital standard data or information over telephone lines from one to another by the use of conventional telephone line type modems. The conventional telephone line type modem is not reliable over cellular telephone systems, radio frequency networks or satellite systems.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">There are other error-correcting modems able to send and receive standard data over cellular telephone systems, and other modems able to send and receive standard data over radio frequency networks, and other modems able to send and receive standard data over satellite systems, but none have the capabilities to work with all four; telephone line service, radio frequency networks, satellite systems and cellular telephone systems.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">One modem that connects to a computer and a cellular phone is able to send and receive standard data over cellular and land line telephone systems; the Bridge modem. It will not communicate to a conventional telephone line type of modem, but using the Bridge's host modem; the Span modem, connected to a computer and a telephone line, the Bridge modem is able to achieve error-free standard data communication over cellular telephone systems. It is rated at 1200 bps, but with the overhead of it's proprietary error correcting scheme, the throughput of the Bridge is no more than 80%. The Span modem, if it is manually switched to non-cellular mode, will work with a conventional telephone line type of modem via telephone line; but the Span modem, connected to a computer and a telephone line, is unable to distinguish or auto switch from a cellular incoming Bridge call or an incoming conventional telephone line type of modem call. This makes the Span modem unsuitable as a host type of modem where you have incoming cellular and conventional telephone line type modem calls. Two separate modems, a Span modem and a conventional telephone line type of modem on two separate telephone lines would have to be used to handle this situation. The Bridge or Span modems do not support voice or fax communication over wireless radio frequency telemetry modules, packet radios, satellite systems or telephone line communications.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">The standard data communications discussed above is the serial type of standard data communications which has two different forms, namely synchronous and asynchronous.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">Synchronous communication requires the use of a common clock between the communication systems. Compared to asynchronous communication, synchronous communication is faster, but is also requires more complex controlling software as well as hardware for it to properly transmit and receive standard data. One of the primary applications of synchronous communication is in high-speed computer-to-computer or DTE to DTE communications.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">Asynchronous communication does not require a common clock between the two communication systems; thus, the two systems are not synchronized with each other. Instead of sharing a common clock, each system has its own clock, which, in order to communicate properly, must be very close to the clock rate of the other system. Because there is no common synchronizing clock between asynchronous systems, they are limited to slower speeds. Modems used by the personal computer owner are typically asynchronous.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">During the transfer or sending of large amounts of digital data (such as a standard file transfer or fax), it is important that errors do not occur and if they do occur it is important to discover and correct any such errors in the data.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">The solution to the problem is to have communications software monitor the accuracy of the transferred standard or fax data and request that standard or fax data be sent again when errors are detected. Software techniques for doing this are called protocols. The error detection and correction procedure allows for the detection of and orderly recovery from errors caused by factors outside the control of the computer at either end. Signal quality deterioration, interference or noise, hand-off, and loss of carrier are some of the primary problems in the transfer of standard or fax data over rural telephone lines, cellular telephone systems, satellite systems and radio frequency networks.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">There is a need to be able to have voice communication and error-free transmission of digital standard and fax data over cellular telephone systems, telephone line service, satellite systems and radio frequency networks from a remote type of DTE to a host type DTE connected to a telephone line type of modem-controller capable of distinguishing and auto switching from an incoming cellular call, conventional telephone line call, satellite system call, or radio frequency call and to transmit and receive at a rate higher than 1200 baud.</p>
  <p num="p-0017">U.S. Pat. No. 4,456,793 to Baker et al. shows a computer with an optical link and an optical transceiver mounted in a ceiling or other high place.</p>
  <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0018">A method and apparatus (modem-controller) for auto switching and controlling the transmission and receiving of voice and error-free transmission of standard data signals, fax data signals and voice communications over telephone line service, radio frequency networks, satellite systems, as well as cellular telephone systems is provided and is operatively connected to computers or other types of DTE, a method to select a data access arrangement (DAA) which either connects to a telephone line, satellite system or a cellular telephone, and another method to bypass the DAA and select and control radio frequency telemetry modules or packet radios. The apparatus includes analog switches that receive control signals from the micro-controller for controlling and switching the audio or data path of the internal voice board and the analog signals from the data pump to and from a radio frequency transceiver via the radio frequency transceiver interface/logic board, a cellular telephone transceiver via the cellular telephone transceiver interface, a telephone landline via a data DAA, a satellite system via a telephone landline through the DAA. Therefore, voice signals from the voice board, standard data or fax data from a computer or other type of DTE device can be sent over telephone landlines, wireless radio frequency networks, satellite system networks, cellular telephone system networks and infrared transmission.</p>
  <p num="p-0019">With reference to the software implementation, the operation of modem-controller is divided into three modes; comprising a command mode, a data mode and an escape mode. Therefore, the software is based upon the three modes of operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0020">In order to eliminate standard or fax data errors that may occur during signal quality deterioration, interference, noise, hand-off, and loss of carrier using dirty or poor quality conventional telephone line service, radio frequency networks, satellite systems and cellular telephone systems, the ITC-RM was developed. The ITC Reliable Mode (ITC-RM) enhances and fine tunes Microcom Networking Protocol (MNP) levels 2, 3, 4 and 5. ITC-RM is programmed in the modem BIOS in an erasable programmable read only memory (EPROM) <b>16</b> for modem-controller <b>120</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0021">Microcom Networking Protocol is a set of data communication protocols which provide error correction and data compression services in communication devices like modems over conventional telephone lines. MNP classes 2-4, are for error correction and synchronous data transmission and are in the public domain. Microcom Networking Protocol (MNP) class 5, used for data compression, is licensed by ITC from Microcom.</p>
  <p num="p-0022">Among the unique advantages offered by the present invention installed in remote computer or DTE is the ITC-Reliable Mode. The ITC-RM enhances and fine tunes MNP for users who require fast, reliable and error-free standard data or fax data transmission over particularly poor lines, such as conventional rural telephone lines, radio frequency networks, satellite systems and cellular telephone systems. The present invention installed in a host computer or DTE is able to distinguish and auto switch from cellular incoming calls, radio frequency calls, satellite incoming calls or incoming conventional telephone line type of modem calls. The present invention installed in a remote computer or DTE communicating to the present invention installed in another remote or host computer or DTE via telephone line service, cellular telephone systems, satellite systems or radio frequency networks is able to transmit and receive standard data and fax data at a rate up to and exceeding 9600 bps.</p>
  <p num="p-0023">The invention may be installed internally in computers or other type of DTE to communicate over a cellular telephone system, a radio frequency network, a satellite system or telephone line service with other computers or other type of DTE.</p>
  <p num="p-0024">Also, an external version of the invention can be connected to computers or other type of DTE via serial ports to communicate over a cellular telephone system, a radio frequency network, a satellite system or telephone line service with other computers or other type of DTE.</p>
  <p num="p-0025">More particularly, but not by way of limitation, using an enhanced and fine tuned version of MNP such as ITC-RM, the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for transmission of standard data and fax data over a cellular telephone system, radio frequency network, satellite system or a telephone line service with emphasis upon the error-free transmission and reception of standard data and fax data in an error correcting mode. In one arrangement, the invention includes infrared transmission capability connected to the computer through the modem-controller.</p>
  <p num="p-0026">The present invention also supports a mode of operation or control that allows an external telephone device such as an external fax machine to interface via the telephone line jack to the cellular telephone interface and then to the cellular telephone transceiver to do wireless fax transmission over a cellular telephone system.</p>
  <p num="p-0027">When either the radio frequency network, cellular telephone system, infrared, satellite system or a telephone line method of communication is used, the invention automatically switches to the selected method desired and connects to the proper service selected; radio frequency (RF), cellular, satellite or telephone line or a combination of phones or radios, for the correct protocol to enable error-free standard data or fax data and voice communication.</p>
  <p num="p-0028">The invention is highly flexible, allowing the unit to support multiple protocols currently in use, and supporting future protocols like V.42 compliant error correction, V.42 bis data compression protocol, and MNP class 10 as they become available.</p>
  <p num="p-0029">The invention supports standard data and fax data protocols compatible to Group 3 (G3) fax, CCITT V.22A/B and V.22 bis, V.23, V.29, V.27 ter, V.21 channel 2 recommendations, and Bell 212A and Bell 103 with auto-fallback. The invention also implements a fine tuned version of Microcom Networking Protocol (MNP) error correcting protocol and data compression classes 2, 3, 4, and 5 called the ITC Reliable Mode (ITC-RM), and operates in non-error-correction mode as well. This provides error-free standard or fax data communication over cellular systems, radio frequency networks, satellite system networks and telephone line service regardless of line quality.</p>
  <p num="p-0030">The invention allows any computer or DTE to be an isolated communication device; when using a speakerphone and dialing telephone numbers, through the use of communication software, using a computer's or DTE's numeric keypad or numeric keys and can automatically dial or answer through communication software script files.</p>
  <p num="p-0031">This invention is distinctive and unique in that it is not a modification or incorporation from existing apparatus. Until this present invention, there has not been one apparatus capable of the transfer of voice, standard data or fax data through radio frequency networks, cellular telephone systems, satellite systems; infrared apparatus and conventional telephone line service in an error-free environment.</p>
  <p num="p-0032">Examples of the more important features and advantages of the invention have thus been summarized rather broadly in order that the following detailed description thereof may be better understood and in order that the contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are, of course, additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter and which will also form the subject of the claims appended hereto. Other features of the invention will become apparent with reference to the following detailed description of a presently preferred embodiment thereof in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals have been applied to like elements in which:</p>

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0036">Referring to the drawing and to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in particular, shown therein and generally designated by the reference character <b>120</b>, is a preferred embodiment of a modem-controller according to the present invention. Microcontroller <b>10</b> is a microprocessor which is employed as the controller for modem-controller <b>120</b>. One static read-only memory (RAM) <b>14</b> is added to the system to provide adequate working space for programming. An erasable programmable read only memory (EPROM) <b>16</b> is added to the system to provide enough ROM space for the firmware. RAM <b>14</b> and EPROM <b>16</b> are operatively connected to microcontroller <b>10</b> by data and address bus <b>12</b>. Microcontroller <b>10</b> executes the firmware or modem BIOS stored in EPROM <b>16</b> and manipulates the data in RAM <b>14</b> through the data and address bus <b>12</b>. A decoder in microcontroller <b>10</b> is used to decode the address bus to select RAM <b>14</b>, EPROM <b>16</b> or data pump <b>18</b>. Modem-controller <b>120</b> communicates with the DTE <b>2</b> through the RS232C interface <b>6</b> operatively connected to microcontroller <b>10</b>. In the disclosed embodiment, DTE <b>2</b> is a computer or DTE. Ring indicator signal is sent to data pump chip <b>18</b> via bus <b>32</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0037">Data pump chip <b>18</b> is operatively connected to microcontroller <b>10</b> by data and control bus <b>20</b>. Data pump chip <b>18</b> is a 2400 baud, full duplex, data pump fax modem device set.</p>
  <p num="p-0038">It includes a digital signal processor (DSP) and an integrated analog (IA) device. In addition to digital signal processing on the transmitted data, the DSP provides the interface to microcontroller <b>10</b> for information exchange and controlling. The IA chip functions like a digital to analog converter and an analog to digital converter to manipulate the signal to and from the DSP.</p>
  <p num="p-0039">Modem-controller <b>120</b> is able to connect to the normal telephone line <b>80</b> through RJ11 jack <b>116</b> connected via bus <b>115</b> to data access arrangement (DAA) <b>64</b> interface and access, via telephone line(s) <b>80</b>, remote device <b>102</b>, such as another modem connected to a computer or other type of DTE or a Fax machine. Modem-controller <b>120</b> establishes the connection through a dialing process by specific AT commands from the keyboard of DTE <b>2</b>. Although most of the applications of modem transmission involves dial-up lines, modem-controller <b>120</b> can also be connected to a leased (private) line. Under this condition, special line conditioning is not needed and the operation is full duplex over this leased line. In other words, there is not any dialing process required before connection to the leased line. The telephone line ring indication signal is transferred from the DAA <b>64</b> to modem chip <b>18</b> via bus <b>32</b> while the -OHRELAY, MUTE and -T/D RELAY signals are transferred to DAA <b>64</b> from modem chip <b>18</b> via bus <b>34</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0040">When an incoming call is present, the ring indication signal is recognized by the Integrated Analog (IA) Device of modem chip <b>18</b> with appropriate control signals being sent to DAA <b>64</b> by modem chip <b>18</b>. The assertion of the -OHRELAY signal causes an offhook (online) function to be performed. The -T/D RELAY signal controls when telephone line <b>80</b> is connected to RJ11 jacks <b>116</b> through bus <b>115</b> to DAA <b>64</b>. MUTE is a signal controlled by microcontroller <b>10</b> to reduce the transient effects during offhook and on hook operations due to the on/off of the relay controlled by the -OHRELAY signal.</p>
  <p num="p-0041">The switching or routing of standard or fax data or voice to radio frequency telemetry module or packet radio interface <b>110</b>, DAA <b>64</b> to RJ11 jacks <b>115</b>, or cellular telephone interface <b>104</b> is performed by analog switches <b>70</b>, <b>74</b>, <b>78</b> which may be comprised of analog multiplexer/demultiplexer chips. Analog switch <b>70</b> is controlled by the telephone line select (TL-SEL) signal from microcontroller <b>10</b> via bus <b>68</b>. Analog switch <b>74</b> is controlled by cellular phone interface select (CPI-SEL) signal from microcontroller <b>10</b> via bus <b>72</b>. Analog switch <b>78</b> is controlled by RF radio interface select (RFI-SEL) signal from microcontroller <b>10</b> via bus <b>76</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0042">The auto switching between standard or fax data mode and voice mode is performed by analog switches <b>44</b> which may be comprised of a analog multiplexer/demultiplexer chip. Analog switch <b>44</b> is controlled by voice-or-data select (VORD-SEL) signal from microcontroller <b>10</b> via bus <b>42</b>. This VORD-SEL signal from microcontroller <b>10</b> is controlled by a AT command suffix, alpha character “v”, received from DTE <b>2</b> through bus <b>4</b>, RS232C <b>6</b> and bus <b>8</b>. If a dialing command is received by the microcontroller and it ends in the alpha character. “v”, a VORD-SEL signal will be sent to analog switch <b>44</b> to select the voice mode.</p>
  <p num="p-0043">If a dialing command is received by microcontroller <b>10</b> and it does not have the alpha character “v” as a suffix, a VORD-SEL signal will be sent to analog switch <b>44</b> to select the standard or fax data mode. If analog switch <b>44</b> is in the standard or fax data select position, selected by microcontroller <b>10</b> VORD-SEL signal, analog switches <b>70</b>, <b>74</b> and <b>78</b> allow the analog signals transmitted from and received by modem chip <b>18</b> to be routed either to RJ11 jacks <b>115</b> or cellular phone interface <b>104</b> via bus <b>36</b>, amplifier <b>38</b>, bus <b>40</b>, analog switch <b>44</b>, bus <b>62</b>, analog switch <b>78</b>, bus <b>96</b>, DAA <b>64</b>, and bus <b>66</b> or to radio frequency interface <b>110</b> via bus <b>36</b>, amplifier <b>38</b>, bus <b>40</b>, analog switch <b>44</b>, bus <b>62</b>, analog switch <b>78</b>, bus <b>98</b>. If analog switch <b>44</b> is in the voice select position, selected by microcontroller <b>10</b> VORD-SEL signal, analog switches <b>70</b>, <b>74</b> and <b>78</b> allow voice communication transmitted from and received by internal voice board <b>52</b> to be routed either to RJ11 jacks <b>116</b>, radio frequency interface <b>110</b> and cellular phone interface <b>104</b> via external mike <b>60</b>, bus <b>56</b>, external speaker <b>58</b>, bus <b>54</b>, voice board <b>52</b>, bus <b>50</b>, amplifier <b>48</b>, bus <b>46</b>, analog switch <b>44</b>, bus <b>62</b>, analog switch <b>78</b>, and either bus <b>96</b> to DAA <b>64</b>, and bus <b>66</b> or bus <b>98</b> to radio frequency interface <b>110</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0044">The present invention also supports another mode of operation or control. Another type of telephone device such as an external fax machine can interface via telephone line <b>80</b>, RJ11 jacks <b>116</b>, bus <b>115</b>, bus <b>82</b>, analog switch <b>88</b>, bus <b>100</b> to the cellular phone interface <b>104</b>, bus <b>106</b>, and then to the cellular telephone <b>108</b> to do wireless external fax transmission over a cellular telephone system.</p>
  <p num="p-0045">This mode is controlled by the microcontroller <b>10</b> and if the following conditions exist: A cellular telephone <b>108</b> is connected, their corresponding interface, cellular telephone interface <b>104</b> is switched on, and a telephone device is attached to the RJ11 jacks <b>116</b>. The switching or routing of the telephone line <b>80</b> to the cellular phone interface <b>104</b> is performed by analog switches <b>88</b> which may be comprised of analog multiplexer/demultiplexer chips.

  <p num="p-0048">The cellular telephone <b>108</b> connected to modem-controller <b>120</b> is full duplex radio telephone for use in cellular telephone systems. It consists of an internal transmitter and receiver (transceiver) unit, keypad, display, antenna, mike and speaker. The cellular telephone provides full duplex synthesized FM radio channels for voice and standard or fax data transmission between the cell site base stations.</p>
  <p num="p-0049">The design strategy of the cellular phone interface <b>104</b> is to provide a simulation of a telephone line tip and ring from a cellular telephone <b>108</b> for connection to DAA <b>64</b> of modem-controller <b>120</b>. In other words, when cellular mode is selected by microcontroller <b>10</b>, a interface through DAA <b>64</b> to cellular phone interface <b>104</b> and then cellular telephone <b>108</b> is made and voice and standard or fax data transmission through cellular telephone <b>108</b> is made like it is a ordinary telephone line.</p>
  <p num="p-0050">The 800 MHz radio frequency packet radio <b>114</b> connected to modem-controller <b>120</b>, when interfaced, is a half-duplex radio with synthesized frequency selection for operation in the 800 MHz band for transmitting and receiving and provides 3 watts of output power. Using two 800 MHz radio frequency packet radio modules <b>114</b> and <b>115</b>, connected to modem-controller <b>120</b>, full duplex operation is achieved.</p>

The transmitter power output is 1 watts at 7.2 volts. It uses 25 kHz channel spacing.

  <p num="p-0054">The RS232C standard defines the interface between DTE <b>2</b> and microcontroller <b>10</b> and modem chip <b>18</b>. Commands entered from DTE <b>2</b> is sent via RS232C cable <b>4</b>, RS232C interface <b>6</b>, and bus <b>30</b> by asynchronous transmission into serial port, bus <b>8</b> to microcontroller <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0055">Modem-controller <b>120</b> contains a high performance 2400/9600 baud data pump that supports 9600 baud fax and 2400 baud standard data speeds and is designed such that it can be used for standard data or fax data transmission and receiving with ordinary telephone lines, radio frequency (RF), satellite systems and cellular systems. Unlike conventional modems, it does not provide any hardware jumpers or switch settings and thus eliminates the inconvenience of hardware jumpers or switch settings for ease of operation to non-technical users. Instead, the alteration of all functional features can be thoroughly accessed through AT commands and settings of S registers through communication software.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">Modem-controller <b>120</b> is a Hayes compatible modem, including most of the AT commands implemented in Hayes Smart modem except those commands for synchronous transmission and speaker control. In order to increase the efficiency, full-duplex operation is supported during communication. Modem-controller <b>120</b> can establish connection with various speeds such as 300 baud, 600 baud, 1200 baud, 2400 baud, 4800 baud (fax), 9600 baud (fax) under different communication protocols. Retrain sequence is automatically detected and sent to maintain proper communication environment between calling and answering modem during connection. Auto answer mode is activated by setting up the ring count value before connection.</p>
  <p num="p-0057">Modem-controller <b>120</b> can establish the connection in either originate mode or answer mode directly selected by the software. Pulse and tone dialing are both supported in modem-controller <b>120</b> with software selection of the pulse and tone dialing format.</p>
  <p num="p-0058">One of the unique features of modem-controller <b>120</b> is the capability of connection with a cellular telephone <b>108</b>, satellite system radio, or a radio frequency telemetry module or packet radio <b>114</b>. This enhances it's portability when installed in hand held, portable or lap-top computers or DTE (DTE). In addition to standard data or fax data transmission, modem-controller <b>120</b> provides the function for voice communication. Together with voice board <b>52</b>, the user can establish voice conversation in a hands-free mode whether connected to telephone lines <b>80</b>, satellite systems, radio frequency networks and cellular telephone systems <b>108</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">In order to eliminate standard or fax data errors that may occur during signal quality deterioration, interference or noise, hand-off, and loss of carrier using dirty or poor quality conventional voice telephone lines, radio frequency networks, satellite systems, and cellular telephone systems, the ITC-RM was developed. The ITC-RM enhances and fine tunes MNP levels 2, 3, 4 and 5. ITC-RM is programmed in the modem BIOS or firmware in an EPROM <b>16</b> for modem-controller <b>120</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0060">In the present invention, modem-controller <b>120</b> can be connected to a cellular telephone <b>108</b>, satellite system, or a radio frequency telemetry module or packet radio <b>114</b>. Carrier loss happens more frequently in wireless systems than in a ordinary telephone lines. The modem-controller, using ITC-RM, adapts to the unhealthy working environment of wireless systems by increasing the re-try count from two to six in the link phase. The link-up is first initiated at 2400 BAUD. If a 2400 BAUD link-up fails, the modem-controller, using the ITC Reliable Mode (ITC-RM), will down-shift to 1200 BAUD. After successful connection, the modem-controller, using the ITC Reliable Mode (ITC-RM), will set the packet re-try count to eighteen. During carrier loss, the modem-controller, using the ITC-RM, will temporarily suspend standard and fax data transmission to wait for the recovery of the carrier. If the carrier loss occurs in synchronous mode, the modem-controller, using the ITC-RM, will switch back to asynchronous mode until detection of the carrier occurs and will then switch back to synchronous mode. In other words, even if the carrier is lost, the modem-controller will not “hang up”.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">With reference to the software implementation, the operation of modem-controller <b>120</b> is divided into three modes comprising a command mode, a data (standard or fax) mode and an escape mode; therefore, the software is based upon the three modes of operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0062">In the command mode, modem-controller <b>120</b> receives the input via the serial port through the RS232C interface <b>6</b>. If the echo command is on (ATE1), the same character which is input will be fed back to the DTE <b>2</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0063">Modem-controller <b>120</b> accepts the standard AT command set prefix ‘AT’ or ‘A/’ to repeat last command. If the input character is ‘A’, modem-controller <b>120</b> will wait for the typing of ‘T’ or ‘/’. If not received, modem-controller <b>120</b> will repeat the process for the next ‘A’. After receiving a correct command prefix ‘AT’, modem-controller <b>120</b> will start to accept typing as AT command and will store them in the command buffer until a carriage return is entered. Modem-controller <b>120</b> will then process the commands in the command buffer and output corresponding messages to the DTE <b>2</b> via the serial port. If an incorrect command is sent, an error message will be displayed. On the other hand, modem-controller <b>120</b> will not wait for the input of a carriage return if ‘A’ is captured first. Instead, it will repeat the last entered command in the command buffer.</p>
  <p num="p-0064">One of the smart features in the command mode is the capability of auto baud rate checking and auto format adjustment. This is established by the inspection of the AT command prefix ‘AT’ and ‘A/’. At this stage, the reception of the prefix is done on bit manipulation instead of accepting the whole character through the serial port of the microcontroller <b>10</b>. The start bit duration of the typed character is measured and hence the current communication baud rate is determined. According to the measured baud rate, the succeeding bits will be sampled and captured, also the input character is then found. If this is a character ‘A’, then the next character is captured in the same manner except that the duration of its start bit need not be measured again. If the next character is ‘T’ or ‘/’, the process of auto baud rate check will then be completed.</p>
  <p num="p-0065">The format of asynchronous communication protocol parity bit, data bit, stop bit) is also determined during the capture of the command prefix. This is achieved by the sampling of bit <b>8</b> and bit <b>9</b> of the character ‘A’ and valid character ‘T’ or ‘/’. From the different combination of these bits, specific format of protocol is recognized. Afterward, the serial communication that follows will employ the serial port of the microcontroller <b>10</b> since the baud rate and format have been decided.</p>
  <p num="p-0066">If there is an incoming call, the ring signal (ring indication) will be detected and a ‘RING’ message will be shown for each ring.</p>
  <p num="p-0067">If the number of rings received is equal to the value stored in the SO register or the ‘ATA’ command is entered, modem-controller <b>120</b> will connect the line to answer the coming call. It will then switch to standard or fax data mode for transmission.</p>
  <p num="p-0068">To initiate a standard data call, the command ‘ATD’ is entered and then followed by the dialed number. Modem-controller <b>120</b> will check for the presence of a dial tone and then for a buy tone after completing the dialing process. At the end of the dialing process, modem-controller <b>120</b> will wait for the presence of the carrier within the time specified by the value in S<b>7</b> register. If a carrier is detected and connection is successful, standard data mode is entered. Otherwise the call process is aborted.</p>
  <p num="p-0069">To initiate a fax data call, a specialized fax software is employed that lets you simply enter a phone number to dial, be it stored or manual, and press a key to dial. All AT commands are in the background and not entered by the user. Modem-controller <b>120</b> will check for the presence of a dial tone and then for a busy tone after completing the dialing process. At the end of the dialing process, modem-controller <b>120</b> will wait for the presence of the carrier within the time specified by the value in S<b>7</b> register set by the specialized fax software. If a carrier is detected, connection is successful, fax data mode is entered. Otherwise the call process is aborted.</p>
  <p num="p-0070">To initiate a voice call, the command ‘ATD’ is entered, followed by the dialed number and the suffix ‘v’. Modem-controller <b>120</b> will check for the presence of a dial tone and then for a busy tone after completing the dialing process. At then end of the dialing process, modem-controller <b>120</b> will wait for the calling party to answer and on answering, voice mode is entered. Otherwise the call process is aborted. The carrier tone is disabled in the voice mode.</p>
  <p num="p-0071">Because modem-controller <b>120</b> employs ITC-RM, which enhances and fine tunes MNP level 2, 3, 4 and 5 to eliminate standard data errors that may occur using dirty or poor quality conventional voice telephone lines, radio frequency networks, satellite systems and cellular telephone systems, there are two absolutely different modes (normal mode and the MNP) with ITC-RM selectable by the user. For the application of interfacing with a cellular telephone <b>108</b>, satellite system <b>118</b>, and the radio frequency telemetry module or packet radio <b>114</b> and <b>115</b>, the enhanced MNP mode using ITC-RM is compulsory for maintaining proper operation due to the noisy environment and frequently lost carrier. The mode switching is automatically set to this compulsory setting of enhanced MNP mode using ITC-RM if either the radio frequency interface or cellular telephone interface is switched on or manually controlled by a set of particular AT commands (&amp;E0, &amp;E1,&amp;E2) using communication software for landline and satellite system use.</p>
  <p num="p-0072">In the normal mode and without activation of the enhanced MNP mode with ITC-RM, modem-controller <b>120</b> handles the data transmission as a conventional modem. It follows the CCITT or BELL recommendation to perform asynchronous transmission at 300, 600, 1200 or 2400 baud. The data flowing between the modems is on a character basis. No. error detection and data compression is done using this mode.</p>
  <p num="p-0073">In the MNP with ITC-RM, transmission is performed in units of data packets. The technique of handshaking is added to normal data transmission in order to achieve error elimination and protocol compatibility. There are different packets named Link Protocol Data Unit (LPDU) defined in MNP for specific purposes.</p>
  <p num="p-0074">Each LPDU has its own information such as the sequence number and series number and a Cyclical Redundancy Check (CRC) checksum at the end of each LPDU.</p>
  <p num="p-0075">During the connection phase, information exchange between the calling and called party rely on the transmission of LR LPDU and Link Acknowledgement packet (LA LPDU). Through this three way handshaking, a compromised operating environment will be established for both modem devices. Asynchronous transmission works on these packets. If MNP level three or above can be achieved after the Link phase, then synchronous mode will be selected for data transmission in SDLC frame structure with a view to the increase in efficiency. Otherwise, asynchronous mode will be kept unchanged as usual.</p>
  <p num="p-0076">The error detection is done by comparing the calculated CRC with the actual CRC which is received for each packet. If error occurs, an acknowledgement requesting the retransmission of the bad packets will be issued. Hence the enhanced MP with ITC-RM can achieve excellent reliability for data communication over cellular telephone systems and radio frequency networks. A retransmission counter defines the maximum available attempts for retransmission. An inactivity timer keeps tract of the silence time (no information exchange) after the line is connected. If the above time limitation is violated, the transmission will be terminated at once thereby indicating that the current working environment is abnormal and hence the line should be disconnected.</p>
  <p num="p-0077">In normal operation, the data packets will be sent in order. by the sender modem according to their sequence number specified during transmission. For a successful receipt of a data packet (LD LPDU), the receiver must issue the positive acknowledgment to the sender to indicate the correct receipt of the packet. This is accomplished by placing the sequence number of the data packet in the LA LPDU packet. In order to alleviate the overhead caused by the frequently transmitted LA packet, the receive modem does not need to make an immediate response to each data packet received. Instead, it permits the delay of the transmission of LA packets within the extent of the window size (four data packets in the inventive protocol). The receive modem will send the sequence number of the latest good data packet received. As a result, all of the packets with sequence numbers earlier than that in the LA packet which is acknowledged are positively acknowledged by only one transmission of the LA packet.</p>
  <p num="p-0078">If modem-controller <b>120</b> is operating in the escape mode, all the-AT commands can be used. The typing of the escape sequence ‘+++’ in the data mode will switch the modem-controller <b>120</b> to the escape mode for the access of AT commands. On the contrary, the command ‘ATO’ will bring the modem-controller back to the data (online) mode once again.</p>
  <p num="p-0079">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the connection phase of the inventive protocol software, prior to the transmission of data, is disclosed.</p>
  <p num="p-0080">The line, either telephone line, radio frequency, infrared, satellite system or cellular, is connected (line is connected <b>128</b>) between the local and remote modem either through the dialing process or a leased-line operation. Desired communication configuration (establish desired communication <b>130</b>) is established with a remote modem through handshaking. The presence of the carrier from the remote modem (carrier present <b>132</b>) is determined. If the carrier is not present within a specified time (times up <b>136</b>) then the connection will be terminated (terminate the connection <b>134</b>) and the connection phase must be initiated again. If the carrier is not present and the specified time has not elapsed, then the presence of the carrier from the remote modem (carrier present <b>132</b>) will continue until the specified time has elapsed or the presence of the carrier occurs. With the carrier being present, the remote modem is interrogated (interrogate the remote modem <b>138</b>) by sending appropriate link-connect packet to the remote modeme.</p>
  <p num="p-0081">If the correct link-connect packet <b>140</b> is received from the remote modem then the MNP with the ITC-RM connection is successful <b>142</b> and the next step is (go to data phase <b>144</b>) as shown in FIG. <b>3</b>. If the correct link-connect packet <b>140</b> is not received, then the correct link-connect packet <b>140</b> is repeated through the Retry-Count <b>146</b> step until successful receipt of the correct link-connect packet is received or until the Retry-Count=6 step <b>148</b> equals the count of six. At that time, the MNP with ITC-RM connection fails <b>150</b> and a line disconnect <b>152</b> or the connection phase is run in the non-MNP mode and ITC-RM.</p>
  <p num="p-0082">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the data phase of the inventive protocol software, after the successful connection phase, is disclosed. From data phase <b>144</b>, the presence of the carrier (carrier present <b>158</b>) is determined. If the carrier is present, then the determination is made as to the readiness of a data packet (data packet is ready <b>160</b>) for transmission. If the carrier is not present, then the modem is switched to the asynchronous mode (switch to asynchronous mode <b>162</b>) and the presence of the carrier (carrier present <b>164</b>) is determined. Upon the presence of a carrier, modem-controller <b>10</b> is switched to the synchronous mode (switch to synchronous mode <b>166</b>) and the determination is made as to the readiness of a data packet (data packet is ready <b>160</b>). Upon determination that a data packet is ready for transmission then the data packet is transmitted (transmit this data packet <b>168</b>) and acknowledgement is noted (positive acknowledgement received <b>170</b>). If positive acknowledgement received <b>170</b> occurs, then the cycle is back to step <b>158</b>, step <b>160</b>, step <b>168</b> to step <b>170</b>. This cycle is repeated until transmission is complete or carrier is lost. If positive acknowledgement is not received at step <b>170</b>, then a check is made to determine if the retransmission timer elapsed <b>172</b> has occurred. If it has, then the next step is to the (ReTX−count=ReTx−count+1) <b>174</b> to the step of (ReTx−count=18) <b>176</b>. If the ReTx count has not reached 18, then the cycle is back to step <b>168</b> where the data packet is transmitted again until the ReTx−count=18. At that time, the MNP with ITC-RM disconnect sequence <b>178</b> disconnects the modem from the telephone line, cellular phone or radio frequency telemetry module or packet radio. Such a disconnect sequence is of the kind that is well known in the art.</p>
  <p num="p-0083">If the retransmission timer elapsed <b>172</b> has not occurred, then a check is made for a negative acknowledgement received <b>180</b>. If a negative acknowledgement <b>180</b> has been received, then the next step is step <b>174</b> and eventually back to step <b>168</b> (transmit this data packet). If a negative acknowledgement has not been received, then the cycle is back to step <b>170</b> (positive acknowledgement received <b>170</b>) to determine if a positive acknowledgement has been received.</p>
  <p num="p-0084">Whenever a positive acknowledgement is received at step <b>170</b>, that yes status is sent back to step <b>158</b> to check for a carrier, present <b>158</b> so another data packet may be made ready for transmission as in step <b>160</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0085">When a data packet is received <b>182</b>, then an acknowledgement (acknowledge the remote modem <b>184</b>) is noted and the cycle is back to step <b>158</b> to start the sequence to send another data packet. If a packet is not received (acknowledge the remote modem <b>184</b>), then the cycle is back to step <b>158</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0086">In one arrangement, remote device <b>102</b> can be replaced by an infrared transceiver. Such an arrangement can be used on several computers within infrared range of each other to form a network. The area over which the network can operate can be expanded by elevating an infrared relay device.</p>
