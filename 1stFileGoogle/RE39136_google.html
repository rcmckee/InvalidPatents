The invention includes a collapsible rigid frame designed to support an enclosure at a predetermined height. The enclosure has padded walls and is sized and shaped to fit over the rigid frame. The back, first and second side walls of the enclosure are of a first height above a floor of the enclosure while the front wall is of a lower height. The floor of the enclosure is designed to be slightly lower that the top surface of a parental bed. A mattress pad is sized and shaped to fit within the enclosure and is segmented to use as a containing cover for the co-sleeper when the frame is collapsed. A strapping member is provided to hold the co-sleeper to the parental bed. A number of variations of this strapping member are provided. Several styles of support members for enclosure are provided. These include support bars that attach to the rigid frame, a series of hangers that support horizontal bars while hanging from top rails of the frame, and rigid panels and support rods fitted into pockets on the underside of the enclosure. Variants on the invention also include mesh panels for lower portions of the enclosure walls and rigid panels for insertion into pockets in the enclosure walls designed to prevent the formation of unwanted folds in the enclosure walls that could trap a child.

class="abstract">A co-sleeper convertibly adapted for use as a changing table is described. The invention includes a collapsible rigid frame designed to support an enclosure at a predetermined height. The enclosure has padded walls and is sized and shaped to fit over the rigid frame. The back, first and second side walls of the enclosure are of a first height above a floor of the enclosure while the front wall is of a lower height. The floor of the enclosure is designed to be slightly lower that the top surface of a parental bed. A mattress pad is sized and shaped to fit within the enclosure and is segmented to use as a containing cover for the co-sleeper when the frame is collapsed. A strapping member is provided to hold the co-sleeper to the parental bed. A number of variations of this strapping member are provided. Several styles of support members for enclosure are provided. These include support bars that attach to the rigid frame, a series of hangers that support horizontal bars while hanging from top rails of the frame, and rigid panels and support rods fitted into pockets on the underside of the enclosure. Variants on the invention also include mesh panels for lower portions of the enclosure walls and rigid panels for insertion into pockets in the enclosure walls designed to prevent the formation of unwanted folds in the enclosure walls that could trap a child. The co-sleeper is height adjustable for variations in parental bed height.</div>

<heading>FIELD OF INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">The instant invention relates to the field of convertible units for use with babies and very young children; in particular to units which may be easily converted to a changing table or child's bed-side sleeping enclosure, hereinafter referred to for convenience as a “co-sleeper”, that attaches securely to the parents' bed.</p>
  <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0004">Furniture and fixtures for use by babies and small children often presents a problem for parents with limited living space. For this reason it is desirable that such furniture serve more than one purpose. A bedside co-sleeper is very useful for an infant or very young child as it prevents a parent from having to get out of bed to deal with a child requiring minor attention or comforting. If the co-sleeper can then be put to other uses, the parents will save both space and the cost of other furniture. Various examples of such multi-purpose children's furniture have been patented and sold.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">In U.S. Pat. No. 5,349,709, issued to Cheng teaches a folding combination playpen and baby bed having an elevated floorboard. U.S. Pat. No. 5,339,470, issued to Shamie discloses a combination foldable playpen and dressing/changing table. U.S. Pat. No. 5,553,336 issued to Mariol adds an upper level to a playpen to provide a bassinet. The short legs of the upper level are inserted into openings in the top of the vertical supports of the playpen. U.S. Pat. No. 2,632,186, issued to Berk et al. discloses a portable combination crib and playpen. U.S. Pat. No. 2,691,176 issued to Saldana teaches a unit designed for home and travel that may be used as a support for a playpen, bassinet or baby chair.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">Beside cribs that attached to the parents' bed were known at the turn of the century (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,548,005; 620,069; 1,138,451; 1,283,169; 1,267,244) but fell out of favor for many years. Recently there has been a resurgence in the practice of having babies adjacent the parents' bed. Such bed-side devices are taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,172,435 to Griffin et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,148,561 to Tharalson et al; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,293,655 to Van Winkle et al.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">It is an objective of the present invention to provide a bedside co-sleeper that can be adapted for use as a changing table. It is a further objective of the invention to provide a stand-alone unit that is inexpensive, compact and portable. It is still a further objective of the present invention that the unit be simple to erect and collapsible for transport and storage. Finally, it is an objective of the invention that the co-sleeper design consider and address all possible safety considerations related to its use. Other features and advantages of the invention will be seen from the following description and drawings. The present invention addresses many of the deficiencies of prior art convertible sleeping unit inventions and satisfies all of the objectives described above.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0008">A combination co-sleeper and changing table providing the desired features may be constructed from the following components. A rigid frame is provided. The frame provides means for attaching a support platform at a first predetermined height. The first predetermined height is less than a height of a top surface of a mattress of a parental bed. An enclosure is provided. The enclosure has an open top, a surrounding wall and a floor, the floor has an upper surface and a lower surface. The enclosure is sized and shaped to fit removably over the rigid frame with the lower surface of the floor located upon the support platform. A mattress pad is provided. The mattress pad is sized and shaped to fit slidably within the enclosure. Means are provided for removably attaching the rigid frame to a side of the parental bed.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">In a variant of the invention, the rigid frame includes a front side element, a back side element, a first side element and a second side element. The rigid frame is formed at a top by a rear upper horizontal rail and first and second upper side parallel horizontal rails and two upper front corner members and two upper rear corner members in cooperation with the rails. The rigid frame is formed adjacent a floor by front and rear lower parallel horizontal rails and first side and second side lower parallel horizontal rails and four lower corner leg members in cooperation with the rails. A pair of front vertical rails and a pair of rear vertical rails are in further cooperation with the two upper front corner members and the two upper rear corner members and the four lower corner leg members.</p>
