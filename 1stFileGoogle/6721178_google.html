A device, such as computer terminal, mounts to the horizontal tray through installation into a vertically-mounted docking station mounted to the horizontal tray, or through a mounting bracket mounted adjacent to the horizontal tray. A tiltable bracket mounts the docking station to the horizontal tray, and a clutch assembly allows the angle of the bracket and the angle of the docking station and the computer terminal, to be adjusted to avoid glare on the terminal's display screen. With a mounting bracket, a tiltable bracket mounts a vertically-mounted display screen to the top of the horizontal tray. The mobile workstation also carries a power unit including an extended-life battery and a battery charger that connects to an AC power supply to charge the conventional battery pack connected to the computer terminal as well as the extended-life battery carried on the mobile workstation. When the computer terminal is stored in the mobile workstation, the wireless computer terminal can communicate through a radio transceiver in communication with a computer network, such a distributed patient-care computer network. Furthermore, a mobile workstation with a docking station includes a spring-mounted vertically-movable leveling tray that allows the computer terminal to be easily removed from the docking station using a push-down-and-tilt motion. An electronic and/or key lock selectively prevents vertical movement of the leveling tray to secure the computer terminal within the docking station.</div>

    <p>This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/397,817 entitled “Mobile Clinical Workstation” filed Sep. 17, 1999 which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/100,976 filed Sep. 18, 1998.</p>
    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading> <p>This invention relates to mobile workstations and, more particularly, to a mobile workstation that can include an adjustable-height horizontal tray, a pull-out keyboard tray, a vertically-mounted docking station mounted to the tray, a computer terminal mounted beneath the tray, a display screen mounted to the horizontal tray, and a power unit.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Wireless computer terminals are particularly well-suited to medical care environments, such as hospitals, doctors' offices, and nursing homes. Here, wireless computer terminals offer a great advantage by replacing the conventional clipboard hanging from a patient's bed frame or examination table with a wireless computer terminal that uses radio-frequency transmissions to communicate with a distributed computer network. These wireless computer terminals bring bedside medical care into the information age by computerizing medical charts.</p>
    <p>A wireless computer terminal is typically used to post and retrieve the information that was traditionally posted on a bed-side clipboard, such as the patient's prescriptions, vital signs, receipt of medications, scheduled tests, etc. This and other information is now automatically communicated between the wireless computer terminal and a distributed patient-care computer network. A medical practitioner making the rounds, such as a doctor or nurse, usually picks up the wireless computer terminal from a fixed storage location before visiting the patient and takes the terminal into the patient's room. The practitioner then performs the indicated tasks and enters any relevant information into the wireless computer terminal, such as test results, vital signs, observations, and the like. When the visit with the patient is over, the practitioner usually returns the wireless computer terminal to its storage location.</p>
    <p>Deploying a wireless computer terminal in this type of medical care environment presents several challenges. First, the wireless computer terminal should be stored near the patient's hospital or examination room for easy access by the medical practitioner. Second, the wireless computer terminal should be kept secure to prevent theft or tampering. Third, the wireless computer terminal should be easily accessible with one hand because a medical practitioner often has the other hand occupied, for example with a tray of medications, a medical instrument, or the like. Fourth, the battery inside a wireless terminal should be kept charged.</p>
    <p>To address these needs, wireless computer terminals have been deployed in conjunction with wall-mounted cradles or docking stations located outside of patient hospital rooms. The wall-mounted cradle includes a key or electronic lock for selectively securing the computer terminal in the cradle. For example, the cradle may include a vertically movable leveling tray that allows the wireless terminal to be easily removed from, and replaced for storage within, the cradle with one hand using a push-down-and-tilt motion. A locking mechanism selectively prevents the leveling tray from moving vertically. A battery charger connected to an AC power supply charges the computer terminal's battery while the terminal is stored within the cradle.</p>
    <p>These wall-mounted cradles work well but have a number of drawbacks. In particular, a separate wall-mounted cradle with an associated wireless computer terminal is typically located outside each hospital room. This results in a relatively large number of cradles and associated terminals, with each terminal sitting idle most of the day. Purchasing such a large number of cradles and associated terminals is expensive. In addition, once a practitioner removes the terminal from the cradle and takes it into the patient's hospital room, there may no place to conveniently store the terminal inside the hospital room. The practitioner may have to step back outside the patient's room to return the terminal to the cradle if both hands are needed for another activity during the visit, such as making the bed, assisting the patient to get out of bed, dressing a wound, or some other activity.</p>
    <p>In another attempt to address some of the needs of medical practitioners, a mobile cart has been deployed in conjunction with a laptop computer. The mobile cart includes a horizontal tray with an upper surface on which the laptop computer resides. The laptop computer is typically secured on the mobile cart with a KENSINGTON lock (i.e., a cylinder-type key-operated mechanical lock). This mobile cart with an attached laptop computer has some advantages, but it also has a number of drawbacks. Physically walking back and forth from the patient's bedside to the mobile cart to enter patient information into the computer can be inconvenient. In many cases, a removable computer terminal that can be carried over to the patient's bedside would be more convenient. A removable computer terminal more closely resembles a conventional clipboard chart, which may be preferred by practitioners who have grown accustomed to clipboard charts.</p>
    <p>In the previous mobile cart design, however, the practitioner must manually unlock the KENSINGTON lock to remove the laptop computer. This can be inconvenient, particularly when the medical practitioner is holding other items, such medical instruments. The KENSINGTON lock itself, which typically dangles from a cable connected to the computer, can be an annoyance. In addition, the location of the laptop computer on the surface of the cart occupies this space, which might be better used as a workspace for the practitioner to make notes, carry instruments, place medications, and so forth. The laptop computer also has a number of limitations. For example, the computer's battery life is typically about two to three hours, and recharging the battery typically requires plugging the laptop computer's power cord into an AC outlet for several hours. Plugging the laptop computer in for recharging typically idles the mobile cart for this period.</p>
    <p>There is, therefore, a need for an improved docking station for a wireless computer terminal. Specifically, there is a need for a docking station that eliminates the need for a wall-mounted cradle and an associated wireless computer terminal located outside each patient hospital room. There is a further need for a mobile cart and associated computer terminal that is more convenient to use, has increased workspace, and has increased battery life.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention meets the needs described above in a mobile workstation that includes a wheeled chassis, an adjustable-height horizontal tray, and a vertically-mounted docking station supported by the chassis or the horizontal tray. A medical practitioner making the rounds can push the mobile workstation from room to room and use the same computer terminal when attending each patient. An extended-life battery allows the mobile workstation to be used for an entire shift before recharging. The mobile workstation thus eliminates the need for locating a wall-mounted cradle and an associated wireless computer terminal outside each patient's room. Because the docking station is vertically mounted, the terminal does not occupy the top surface of the horizontal tray, which allows this area to be used as a work surface.</p>
    <p>When a docking station is used, a vertically movable leveling tray allows the wireless terminal to be easily removed from, and replaced for storage within, the docking station with one hand. An electronic or key lock allows the docking station to be easily locked and unlocked with one hand. When a docking station is not used, the terminal may be mounted to the top or bottom side of the tray.</p>
    <p>The docking station typically includes an elongate dimension and a relatively slender dimension, and the tray supports the docking station with the elongate dimension substantially vertical and the slender dimension substantially horizontal. The bracket may be tiltably connected to the tray for rotating the docking station relative to the tray. A clutch connecting the tiltable bracket to the tray maintains the docking station in a number of selectable rotational positions relative to the tray.</p>
    <p>The docking station typically includes a retainer for holding the device in the docking station. The docking station also includes a restraining member movable from an open position to a closed position so that the device may be removed from the docking station when the restraining member is in the open position, and so that the device is resiliently restrained in the docking station when the restraining member is in the closed position. For example, the retainer may include two spaced-apart arms for receiving a first side of a computer terminal, and the restraining member may include a leveling tray for resiliently supporting a second side opposite the first side of the computer terminal. The docking station may also include a lock movable from a release position to an interference position to positively restrain the computer terminal in the docking station. In this case, the docking station also includes an unlocking device for selectively moving the lock from the interference position to the release position to allow the computer terminal to be removed from the docking station.</p>
    <p>In an alternative embodiment, the mobile workstation includes a wheeled chassis and a tray supported by the chassis. The tray has an upper surface defining a substantially horizontal work surface. The mobile workstation also includes a bracket mounted adjacent to the work surface for supporting a docking station for holding a device, such as a computer terminal. The device typically includes a display screen, and the docking station supports the device with the display screen in a substantially vertical position above the work surface. The mobile workstation may also include a pull-out keyboard tray supported adjacent to a lower surface of the tray.</p>
    <p>Another alternative configuration of a mobile workstation includes a wheeled chassis, an adjustable-height horizontal tray, a wireless computer terminal supported by the chassis or the horizontal tray, and a power unit supported on the chassis. The tray has an upper surface defining a substantially horizontal work surface. The mobile workstation also includes a front mounting bracket mounted beneath the work surface for supporting a device, such as a wireless computer terminal. The device typically includes or attaches to a display screen, with the display screen above and towards the rear of the work surface. The mobile workstation may also include a pull-out keyboard tray supported adjacent to a lower surface of the tray. The mobile workstation also includes a back mounting bracket mounted adjacent to and beneath the work surface for supporting a power converter. The power converter connects to a battery pack and provides power to the device and to the display screen.</p>
    <p>For each alternative embodiment, the chassis of the mobile workstation includes a dolly assembly, a vertical beam having a first end connected to the dolly assembly and a second end connected to the tray, and a mechanism for altering the length of the vertical beam and maintaining the tray at a number of selectable distances from the dolly assembly. The chassis may also carry a power converter and a power unit including a rechargeable battery for supplying power to the device through the power converter while the device is supported within the docking station, and a battery charger connectable to an AC power source for charging the rechargeable battery. A power cord may connect the battery charger to the AC power source, and the power unit may include a power cord storage assembly operable for retracting the power cord when the power cord is not connected to the AC power source.</p>
    <p>That the invention improves over the drawbacks of the prior art and how it accomplishes the advantages described above will become apparent from the following detailed description of the exemplary embodiments and the appended drawings and claims.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p>The present invention may be embodied in a mobile workstation that includes an adjustable-height horizontal tray and a vertically-mounted docking station mounted to the horizontal tray. The docking station removably supports a computer terminal having a display screen, which may also serve as a touch-sensitive input device, that can be easily seen and accessed when the computer terminal is stored within the docking station. The mobile workstation also includes a keyboard located on a pull-out keyboard tray mounted to the underside of the horizontal tray. The keyboard is connected to the computer terminal by way of the docking station, so that the keyboard is automatically connected to the computer terminal whenever the terminal is stored within the docking station.</p>
    <p>A tiltable bracket mounts the docking station to the horizontal tray. A clutch assembly allows the angle of the bracket, and along with it the angle of the docking station and the computer terminal, to be adjusted to avoid glare on the terminal's display screen. A spring-mounted, vertically-movable leveling tray allows the wireless terminal to be easily removed from the docking station using a push-down-and-tilt motion. An electronic lock selectively prevents vertical movement of the leveling tray to secure the computer terminal within the docking station. The docking station may also include a key-operated lock, which may be used to unlock the docking station in the event of a power outage or if the electronic lock should fail.</p>
    <p>The mobile workstation also carries a power converter and a power unit including an extended-life battery, a battery charger that connects to an AC power supply to charge the conventional battery located inside the computer terminal as well as the extended-life battery carried on the mobile workstation. The power converter converts electrical power supplied by the battery to a suitable electrical input source for the computer terminal and the terminal display. The rechargeable battery power supply increases the battery life of the computer terminal to about 8-12 hours, which allows use of the computer terminal for an extended time before having to fully recharge it. The power unit includes two status-indicator lights to indicate when the unit is operating on AC power and when the battery is low, and a seven-level battery status-indicator light. The power unit may also include a sensor that indicates when the battery is low.</p>
    <p>With the docking station configuration described above, a medical practitioner making the rounds can push the mobile workstation from room to room and use the same computer terminal when attending each patient. The extended-life battery allows the mobile workstation to be used for an entire shift before recharging. The mobile workstation thus eliminates the need for locating a wall-mounted cradle and associated computer terminal outside each patient's room. Because the docking station is vertically mounted, the computer terminal does not occupy the top surface of the horizontal tray, which allows this area to be used as a work surface. The leveling tray allows the computer terminal to be easily removed from, and replaced for storage within, the docking station with one hand. The electronic lock allows the docking station to be easily locked and unlocked with one hand.</p>
    <p>Another embodiment of the present invention may be embodied in a mobile workstation that includes an adjustable-height horizontal tray on a chassis, a vertically mounted display screen mounted above the horizontal tray, a wireless computer terminal and a power converter mounted underneath the horizontal tray, a pull-out keyboard tray mounted beneath the wireless computer terminal, and a power unit mounted to the chassis. The horizontal tray includes an underside front mounting bracket to support the wireless computer terminal, and a rear mounting bracket to support the power converter. The front mounting bracket supports the wireless computer terminal adjacent to and beneath the horizontal tray, leaving the work surface of the horizontal tray available for other operator uses. The back mounting bracket or wiring tray supports the power converter adjacent to and beneath the horizontal tray so that the power converter easily connects to the wireless computer terminal. A tray housing mounted to the underside of the horizontal tray supports a pull-out keyboard tray so that a keyboard mounted within the pull-out tray does not interfere with the front mounting bracket or the rear mounting bracket. The keyboard communicates with the computer terminal through a conventional electrical connection so that the keyboard can be easily connected to the computer terminal whenever the wireless computer terminal is stored within the mobile workstation. The wireless computer terminal removably connects to the display screen that mounts to the top surface of the horizontal tray with a tiltable bracket.</p>
    <p>The mobile workstation also carries a power unit including an extended-life battery and a battery charger that connects to an AC power supply to charge the conventional battery located inside or adjacent to the wireless computer terminal as well as the extended-life battery carried on the mobile workstation. Each battery connects to the power converter to supply power to the wireless computer terminal and the terminal display through the power converter. The rechargeable battery power supply increases the battery life of the computer terminal to about 8-12 hours, which allows use of the computer terminal for an extended time before having to fully recharge it. The power unit includes two status-indicator lights to indicate when the unit is operating on AC power and when the battery is low, and a seven-level battery status-indicator light. The power unit may also include a sensor that indicates when the battery is low.</p>
    <p>Yet another embodiment of the present invention may include an adjustable-height horizontal tray on a chassis, a wireless computer terminal mounted above the horizontal tray, a display screen mounted above the wireless computer terminal, a pull-out keyboard tray mounted beneath the horizontal tray, and a power unit mounted to the chassis. The horizontal tray includes a mounting bracket to support the wireless computer terminal above the horizontal tray, leaving the part of the work surface of the horizontal tray available for other operator uses. A tray housing mounted to the underside of the horizontal tray supports a pull-out keyboard tray so that a keyboard mounted within the pull-out tray does not interfere with the bottom of the horizontal tray. The keyboard communicates with the computer terminal through a conventional electrical connection so that the keyboard can be easily connected to the computer terminal whenever the wireless computer terminal is stored within the mobile workstation. The wireless computer terminal removably connects to the display screen that mounts to the top surface of the horizontal tray with a tiltable bracket.</p>
    <p>The mobile workstation also carries a power converter and a power unit including an extended-life battery and a battery charger that connects to an AC power supply to charge the conventional battery located inside or adjacent to the wireless computer terminal as well as the extended-life battery carried on the mobile workstation. Each battery connects to the power converter to supply power to the wireless computer terminal and the terminal display through the power converter. The rechargeable battery power supply increases the battery life of the computer terminal to about 8-12 hours, which allows use of the computer terminal for an extended time before having to fully recharge it. The power unit includes two status-indicator lights to indicate when the unit is operating on AC power and when the battery is low, and a seven-level battery status-indicator light. The power unit may also include a sensor that indicates when the battery is low.</p>
    <p>With the wireless computer terminal configurations described above, a medical practitioner making the rounds can push the mobile workstation from room to room and use the same computer terminal when attending each patient. The extended-life battery allows the mobile workstation to be used for an entire shift before recharging. The mobile workstation thus eliminates the need for locating a wall-mounted cradle and associated computer terminal outside each patient's room. When the computer terminal is mounted beneath the horizontal tray, the computer terminal does not occupy the top surface of the horizontal tray, which allows this area to be used as a work surface. The front mounting bracket allows the computer terminal to be easily removed from, and replaced for storage within, the front mounting bracket. In the embodiment where the computer terminal is mounted above the horizontal tray, the computer terminal does not occupy the entire top surface of the horizontal tray, which allows the remaining area to be used as a work surface. In this configuration, the mounting bracket above the horizontal tray allows the computer terminal to be easily removed from, and replaced for storage within, the mounting bracket.</p>
    <p>The wireless computer terminal in a mobile workstation can also communicate through a radio-frequency communication channel via a radio transmitter/receiver terminal antenna attached to the top of the horizontal tray. In this manner, the wireless computer terminal can exchange information with a computer network, such as a distributed patient-care computer network.</p>
    <p>Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the mobile workstation could be configured to support a device other than a docking station or a wireless computer terminal, such as a medical instrument. For example, the mobile workstation could be configured to support an ultra-sound device used to view a fetus. The docking station or the wireless computer terminal could be removed from the mobile workstation, and a similarly sized ultra-sound device could be placed within the mobile workstation. The patient could then view the display screen of the mobile workstation to see the results of the ultra-scan procedure. Many other applications, both medical and non-medical, will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the examples described in this specification.</p>
    <p>Turning now to the drawings, in which like numerals indicate like elements throughout the several figures, FIG. 1 illustrates a mobile workstation <b>10</b> in a typical environment, such as a patient's hospital room <b>5</b>. The mobile workstation <b>10</b> includes an adjustable-height horizontal tray <b>12</b> supported by a chassis <b>14</b>. The chassis <b>14</b> includes a dolly assembly <b>16</b> that allows an operator, such as a medical practitioner, to easily push the mobile workstation <b>10</b> from place to place. The horizontal tray <b>12</b> supports a docking station <b>18</b> that, in turn, removably supports a device, such as the wireless computer terminal <b>20</b> with a terminal display screen. The chassis <b>14</b> includes a vertical beam <b>22</b> connecting the horizontal tray <b>12</b> to the dolly assembly <b>16</b>.</p>
    <p>The vertical beam <b>22</b> includes a gas-spring height adjustment mechanism for adjusting the length of the beam and, thus, the height of the horizontal tray <b>12</b> above the dolly assembly <b>14</b>. For example, the chassis <b>14</b> may be a model MPC2001 manufactured by JACO, Inc. with the standard tray replaced by the horizontal tray <b>12</b> shown in FIG. <b>1</b>. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other types of wheeled chassis would be suitable for this purpose. In addition, other types of height adjustment mechanisms would also be suitable, such as a rack and pinion mechanism, a cable and pulley mechanism, a ratchet mechanism, a ball screw mechanism, a removable pin and holes arrangement, and so forth. Nevertheless, a gas-spring height adjustment mechanism is preferred because it is easy operate and ergonomically desirable.</p>
    <p>The mobile workstation <b>10</b> also carries a power unit <b>24</b> including a power converter, a battery charger, an extended-life battery, a power cord <b>26</b>, and a recoil mechanism that automatically recoils the power cord when the cord is not plugged into an AC outlet. The power converter converts power received from the power unit <b>24</b> to suitable power for the wireless computer terminal <b>20</b>. The power unit <b>24</b> is located on the lower end of the chassis <b>14</b>. For example, the power unit <b>24</b> may reside between two metal beams in the dolly assembly <b>16</b> at the lower end of the chassis <b>14</b>. The extended-life battery may be a 12-Volt sealed lead acid battery, and the power supply may be a 120-Volt AC to 16-Volt DC converter.</p>
    <p>The power unit <b>24</b> typically includes a first status-indicator light to inform the user when the unit is running on AC power, a second status-indicator light to inform the user when the battery needs recharging, and a seven-level battery status-indicator light to inform the user about the power status of the battery. The power unit <b>24</b> may also include an alarm or audible indicator to inform the user when the extended-life battery power needs recharging. The extended-life battery can be recharged by connecting the plugging the power cord <b>26</b> into a standard 120-volt AC outlet. When not in use, the recoil mechanism retracts the power cord <b>26</b> into the power unit <b>24</b>.</p>
    <p>The wireless computer terminal <b>20</b> typically includes a radio transmitter/receiver antenna for communicating over an approved radio frequency. In particular, the wireless computer terminal <b>20</b> may establish a radio-frequency communication channel <b>28</b> with a distributed patient-care computer network <b>30</b> through an antenna <b>32</b> connected to a network access point <b>34</b>. This network access point is typically located in an enclosure <b>36</b> located above the ceiling of the hospital room. The network access point <b>34</b>, in turn, allows the wireless computer terminal <b>20</b> to communicate with the distributed patient-care computer network <b>30</b>. For example, the network access point <b>34</b> may be a RANGELAN2 7500 Series Access Point manufactured by PROXIM, INC. of Mountain View, Calif.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 2A-2D are a series of side views of the mobile workstation <b>10</b> illustrating the operation of an adjustable-height horizontal tray <b>12</b> and the tiltable docking station <b>18</b>. FIG. 2A shows the mobile workstation <b>10</b> with the height-adjustable horizontal tray <b>12</b> in a vertically lowered position. To raise the tray, the operator places his or her hand through an opening <b>40</b> in the side of the horizontal tray <b>12</b>. The operator then lifts a release lever <b>42</b>, which releases a stop in the gas-spring height adjustment mechanism in the vertical beam. The operator then raises or lowers the horizontal tray <b>12</b> while holding the release lever <b>42</b> in a raised position.</p>
    <p>Assistance provided by the gas-spring height adjustment mechanism allows the operator to change the height of the horizontal tray <b>12</b> with little effort. Once the horizontal tray <b>12</b> is at a desired height, represented by the height shown in FIG. 2B, the operator releases the lever <b>42</b>, which locks the tray at the desired height. With this type of mechanism, the operator can quickly and easily place the horizontal tray <b>12</b> at virtually any height within the adjustment range of the gas-spring height adjustment mechanism. The assistance provided by the gas-spring height adjustment is ergonomically desirable in that it avoids back strain or other lifting problems that could otherwise be encountered by operators using the mobile workstation <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 2C illustrates the mobile workstation <b>10</b> with the docking station <b>18</b> in a vertical position. A tiltable bracket <b>44</b> attaches the docking station <b>18</b> to the horizontal tray <b>12</b>. A clutch <b>46</b> in the tiltable bracket maintains the docking station <b>18</b> in a number of selectable rotational positions relative to the tray <b>12</b>. The rotational range of the tiltable bracket <b>44</b> is preferably about 30 degrees rearward from vertical. That is, the tiltable bracket <b>44</b> preferably allows the docking station <b>18</b> to be rotated from the position shown in FIG. 2C to the position shown in FIG. <b>2</b>D. The tiltable bracket <b>44</b> could also be configured to allow the docking station <b>18</b> to rotate forward through a similar rotational range.</p>
    <p>It should be understood that the term “substantially vertical” may include a range about a strictly vertical orientation, represented by the 30 degree range illustrated by FIGS. 2C-D. For example, the term “substantially vertical” includes configurations in which the bracket <b>44</b> maintains the docking station <b>18</b> in a strictly vertical orientation, or at a fixed rotational orientation with a vertical component, or within a range of rotational orientations including orientations that include vertical components. Alternatively, the docking station <b>18</b> could be supported in a substantially horizontal position, for example by a drawer or pull-out tray located above or under the horizontal tray <b>12</b>. Other locations for the docking station <b>18</b> may be preferred in certain environments. For example, the docking station could be mounted to the side of the horizontal tray <b>12</b>, to the underside of the horizontal tray <b>12</b>, to the dolly assembly <b>16</b>, to the vertical beam <b>22</b>, and so forth.</p>
    <p>The clutch <b>46</b> imparts sufficient rotational resistance to maintain the docking station <b>18</b>, with an associated computer terminal <b>20</b>, at any of the rotational aspects within the rotational range defined by the tiltable bracket <b>44</b>. At the same time, the rotational resistance imparted by the clutch <b>46</b> is pliant enough to allow the operator to change the rotational orientation of the docking station <b>18</b> with one hand. For example, the operator may easily adjust the angle of the docking station <b>18</b> to avoid glare on the display screen of the computer terminal <b>20</b>. The tiltable bracket <b>44</b> and the clutch <b>46</b> are described in greater detail with reference to FIGS. 6A-B and <b>7</b>A-C below.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 3A-3D are a series of perspective views of the docking station <b>18</b> and an associated wireless computer terminal <b>20</b> showing the push-down-and-tilt motion used to remove the terminal from the docking station. The docking station <b>20</b> includes a base <b>50</b>, a back plane <b>52</b>, and two spaced-apart retaining arms <b>54</b> and <b>56</b>. When the computer terminal <b>20</b> is located in the docking station, the retaining arms <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> support the top side <b>62</b> of the terminal. The base <b>50</b> includes a leveling tray <b>58</b> with a rubber cushion <b>60</b> for receiving the bottom side of the computer terminal <b>20</b>. The rubber cushion <b>60</b> includes raised collars on either end that prevent the computer terminal <b>20</b> from being removed from the docking station <b>18</b> when the leveling tray <b>58</b> is locked in the upper position, as shown in FIG. <b>3</b>A.</p>
    <p>The docking station <b>18</b> includes a control panel <b>62</b> having a keypad <b>64</b>, typically with four keys. The docking station <b>18</b> may be configured so that the keypad <b>64</b> operates as an electronic combination lock. The leveling tray <b>58</b> can be depressed when the docking station is unlocked and, when the docking station <b>18</b> is locked, the leveling tray <b>58</b> cannot be depressed. The docking station <b>18</b> may also include a manual key lock that may be used to lock and unlock the docking station in the event of a power outage or a malfunction of the electronic lock.</p>
    <p>The control panel <b>62</b> may also include status lights <b>64</b> <i>a-c </i>that indicate status information regarding the docking station <b>18</b>. For example, these status lights typically indicate whether the docking station is locked, whether power is on, and provide status information while a user is configuring the docking station with passwords. A touch-pin battery charging terminal <b>68</b> or other conventional electrical connection located in the leveling tray <b>58</b> may be used to charge a battery within the computer terminal <b>20</b> while the terminal is stored within the docking station <b>18</b>. This battery charging terminal, in turn, is connected to the power unit <b>24</b>. The power unit includes the power cord <b>26</b>, which may be plugged into a standard 120 Volt AC outlet. In addition, the docking station <b>18</b> may include a communication interface, such as an optical interface, for communicating data between the computer terminal <b>20</b> and the docking station <b>18</b> while the terminal is stored within the docking station. This allows the computer terminal <b>20</b> to communicate with the keypad <b>64</b> and/or an optional keyboard that plugs into the docking station <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p>To remove the computer terminal <b>20</b>, an operator first unlocks the docking station <b>18</b> and then places his or her hand on the top side <b>62</b> of the terminal and pushes downward. Provided that the docking station <b>18</b> is unlocked, this motion depresses the leveling tray <b>58</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>3</b>B. The operator then tilts the terminal <b>20</b> forward, as shown in FIG. 3C, and removes the terminal <b>20</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>3</b>D. An example of a suitable docking station is described in commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/841,496, entitled “Cradle For Holding A Device,” filed Apr. 23, 1997, which is incorporated into this specification by reference.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 4A-B are perspective views of the mobile workstation <b>10</b> showing the operation of a pull-out keyboard tray <b>70</b>, which is supported by the underside of the horizontal tray <b>12</b>. The pull-out keyboard tray <b>70</b> slides from an inner position, shown in FIG. 4A, to an outer position, shown in FIG. 4B. A keyboard mounted on the keyboard tray <b>70</b> typically plugs into the docking station <b>18</b>, which communicates keystrokes with the computer terminal <b>20</b> by way of a conventional electrical connection. This allows an operator to easily remove the computer terminal <b>20</b> from the docking station <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p>In FIGS. 4A-4B, the top portion of a rectangular cover for the vertical beam <b>22</b> has been removed, showing an underlying shaft <b>72</b> and a power cable <b>73</b> connecting the power unit <b>24</b> to the docking station <b>18</b>. This shaft <b>72</b> connects to the gas-spring height adjustment mechanism <b>74</b> that allows adjustment of the height of the horizontal tray <b>12</b>. The gas-spring height adjustment mechanism <b>74</b>, which is located at the bottom of the vertical beam <b>22</b>, sits on top of the dolly assembly <b>16</b>. This dolly assembly includes an arched cross-beam <b>76</b> that connects to two horizontal runner beams <b>78</b> <i>a-b</i>. Two casters, represented by the caster <b>80</b>, are connected to the bottom sides of each horizontal runner beam <b>78</b> <i>a-b</i>. The power unit <b>24</b> is mounted below the arched cross beam <b>76</b> to an arched support plate <b>82</b>, which connects between the horizontal runner beams <b>78</b> <i>a-b. </i> </p>
    <p>FIGS. 4A-B also show that the top side of the horizontal tray <b>12</b> defines a substantially horizontal work surface <b>86</b>, which is bordered by a raised edge guard <b>88</b>. The rear edge of the horizontal tray <b>12</b> includes a recess <b>90</b> for the docking station <b>18</b>, which defines an elongate dimension <b>92</b> and a relatively slender dimension <b>94</b>. That is, the docking station <b>18</b> is substantially taller than it is thick. The tiltable mounting bracket <b>44</b> supports the docking station <b>18</b> so that the elongate dimension <b>92</b> is substantially vertical and the relatively slender dimension <b>94</b> is substantially horizontal. Because the docking station <b>18</b> is vertically mounted, the terminal <b>20</b> does not occupy the top surface <b>86</b> of the horizontal tray <b>12</b>, which allows this area to be used as a work surface. In addition, the computer terminal <b>20</b> typically includes a display screen <b>96</b>, and the docking station <b>18</b> supports the terminal with the display screen substantially perpendicular to and above the top surface <b>86</b> of the horizontal tray <b>12</b> for easy viewing. It will be understood that the term “substantially perpendicular” includes a range of orientations because the docking station <b>18</b> may rotate through a rotational range about a strictly perpendicular orientation.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5A is a side view of the horizontal tray <b>12</b> showing the access hole <b>40</b> and the release lever <b>42</b> for raising and lowering the horizontal tray <b>12</b>. The release lever <b>42</b> operates the gas-spring height adjustment lever, which is shown best in FIG. <b>4</b>A. FIG. 5A also shows the end of the pull-out keyboard tray <b>70</b>, which includes a lip <b>98</b> to aid in pulling the keyboard tray out and pushing it back in.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5B is a perspective view of the horizontal tray <b>12</b> showing the access hole <b>40</b> and the release lever <b>42</b> for raising and lowering the horizontal tray <b>12</b>. FIG. 5B also shows the top surface <b>86</b>, the edge guard <b>88</b>, and the recess <b>90</b> of the horizontal tray <b>12</b>. The top surface <b>86</b> of the horizontal tray <b>12</b> is preferably constructed from a non-porous material, such as plastic or metal. For example, the horizontal tray <b>12</b> may be constructed from a flat wooden, particle board, or composite substrate covered with a plastic overlay defining the top surface <b>86</b> and the edge guard <b>88</b>. The plastic overlay may be created with an injection mold, and then glued to the substrate. The bracket <b>44</b> includes mounting brackets <b>102</b> <i>a-b </i>and a back plane <b>100</b> supporting the docking station. The back plane <b>100</b> may be formed from a heavy gauge sheet metal, fiberglass, or composite. The sides <b>103</b> and bottom <b>104</b> the horizontal tray <b>12</b> may be formed from sheet metal.</p>
    <p>FIG. 6A is a back view, and FIG. 6B is a reverse view, of the horizontal tray <b>12</b> showing the tiltable bracket <b>44</b>, including the back plane <b>100</b> and mounting brackets <b>102</b> <i>a-b</i>. The mounting brackets <b>102</b> <i>a-b </i>are bolted to the rear side of the horizontal tray <b>12</b> and extend into the recess <b>90</b> so that the back plane <b>100</b> is approximately flush with the rear side of the horizontal tray <b>12</b> when the back plane is in a vertical position. The mounting brackets <b>102</b> <i>a-b </i>each include an arcuate slot <b>106</b> <i>a-b </i>to allow the back plane <b>100</b> to rotate through a rotational range with respect to the mounting brackets. For example, that rotational range is approximately 30 degrees in the configuration shown in FIGS. 6A-B. Clutch assemblies <b>46</b> <i>a-b </i>at the connections between the mounting brackets <b>102</b> <i>a-b </i>the back plane <b>100</b> support the back plane <b>100</b>, with an associated docking station <b>18</b> and computer terminal <b>20</b>, in virtually any rotational orientation within the rotational range defined by the slots <b>106</b> <i>a-b. </i> </p>
    <p>FIG. 7A is an exploded view the mounting brackets <b>102</b> <i>a-b </i>and the clutch assemblies <b>46</b> <i>a-b</i>. Referring to the clutch assembly <b>46</b> <i>b </i>for illustration purposes, this assembly includes two identical connection assemblies <b>110</b> <i>a-b</i>. Referring now to the connection assembly <b>110</b> <i>a </i>for illustration purposes, this assembly includes a threaded standoff <b>112</b> including a collar that passes through a hole in the support frame <b>114</b> of the back plane <b>100</b> and a rim that catches on the support frame. The threaded standoff <b>112</b> is preferably press-fitted into the hole in the support frame <b>114</b>.</p>
    <p>The connection assembly <b>110</b> <i>a </i>also includes a nylon shoulder washer <b>116</b> including a collar that passes through a hole in the mounting bracket <b>44</b>b and a rim that catches on the mounting bracket. The collar of nylon shoulder washer <b>116</b> is sized to snugly receive the threaded standoff <b>112</b>. The connection assembly <b>110</b> <i>a </i>also includes a nylon washer <b>118</b>, two steel washers <b>120</b> and <b>122</b>, and a steel spring washer <b>124</b> positioned for compression between the steel washers. A bolt <b>126</b> passes through these washers and screws into the threaded standoff <b>112</b>. The bolt <b>126</b> may be tightened into the threaded standoff <b>112</b> to compress the steel spring washer <b>124</b> and provide a desired amount of resistance in the connection assembly <b>110</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p>FIG. 7B is a side view of the spring washer <b>124</b>, and FIG. 7C is a perspective view of the spring washer. These figures show that the spring washer <b>124</b> has a slight conical shape that is raised in the middle with respect to the outer perimeter. This type of spring washer provides a compact and inexpensive mechanism for imparting an adjustable amount of resistance in the connection assembly <b>110</b> <i>a</i>. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other types of clutch assemblies could be employed in embodiments of the invention.</p>
    <p>Another embodiment of a mobile workstation is shown in FIG. 8 illustrates a mobile workstation <b>210</b> in a typical environment, such as a patient's hospital room <b>205</b>. The mobile workstation <b>210</b> includes an adjustable-height horizontal tray <b>212</b> supported by a chassis <b>214</b>. The chassis <b>214</b> includes a dolly assembly <b>216</b> that allows an operator, such as a medical practitioner, to easily push the mobile workstation <b>210</b> from place to place. The horizontal tray <b>212</b> includes an underside tray housing <b>218</b>, an underside front mounting bracket <b>220</b>, and an underside back mounting bracket <b>222</b> or wiring tray.</p>
    <p>The tray housing <b>218</b> supports a keyboard (not shown) or keypad for a wireless computer terminal (not shown). The wireless computer terminal mounts within the front mounting bracket <b>220</b>. The back mounting bracket <b>222</b> or wiring tray supports a power converter (not shown) supplying power to the wireless computer terminal. A tiltable display screen <b>224</b> attaches to the top of the horizontal tray <b>212</b> while connecting to the wireless computer terminal. The back mounting bracket <b>222</b> or wiring tray can also support additional power converters for the display screen <b>224</b> or for other electrical devices associated with the mobile workstation <b>210</b>.</p>
    <p>The chassis <b>214</b> includes a vertical beam <b>226</b> connecting the horizontal tray <b>212</b> to the dolly assembly <b>216</b>. The vertical beam <b>226</b> includes a gas-spring height adjustment mechanism (not shown) and a release lever <b>228</b> for adjusting the length of the beam <b>226</b> and, thus, the height of the horizontal tray <b>212</b> above the dolly assembly <b>216</b>. For example, the chassis <b>214</b> may be a model MPC2001 manufactured by JACO, Inc. with the standard tray replaced by the horizontal tray <b>212</b> shown in FIG. <b>8</b>. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other types of wheeled chassis would be suitable for this purpose. In addition, other types of height adjustment mechanisms would also be suitable, such as a rack and pinion mechanism, a cable and pulley mechanism, a ratchet mechanism, a ball screw mechanism, a removable pin and holes arrangement, and so forth. Nevertheless, a gas-spring height adjustment mechanism <b>228</b> is preferred because it is easy operate and ergonomically desirable.</p>
    <p>The mobile workstation <b>210</b> also carries a power converter (not shown) within the back mounting bracket <b>222</b> and a power unit <b>230</b> including a battery charger, an extended-life battery, a power cord <b>232</b>, and a recoil mechanism that can retract the power cord when the cord is not in use. The power unit <b>230</b> supplies power to the wireless computer terminal through the power converter. The power unit <b>230</b> is located on the lower end of the chassis <b>214</b>. For example, the power unit <b>230</b> may reside between two metal beams in the dolly assembly <b>216</b> at the lower end of the chassis <b>214</b>. A suitable power unit <b>230</b> is a 26 Amp-Hour battery providing a regulated 10-16 Volt output at 40 watts with an automatic low power cut-off. The extended-life battery may be a 12-Volt sealed lead acid battery, and the battery charger may be a 120-Volt AC to 16-Volt DC converter.</p>
    <p>The power unit <b>230</b> typically includes a first status-indicator light to inform the user when the unit is operating off of AC power, a second status-indicator light to inform the user when the battery needs recharging, and a seven-level battery status-indicator light. The power unit <b>230</b> may also include a sound indicator that beeps to inform the user when the extended-life battery needs recharging. When plugged into an AC outlet, the battery charger will charge both the extended-life battery and operate the wireless computer terminal by supplying the power converter connected to the computer terminal. The extended-life battery can be recharged by plugging the power cord <b>232</b> into a standard 120-volt AC outlet. When not in use, the recoil mechanism can retract the power cord <b>232</b> into the power unit <b>230</b>.</p>
    <p>The wireless computer terminal inside the mobile workstation <b>210</b> communicates through a radio transmitter/receiver terminal antenna <b>234</b> attached to the top of the horizontal tray <b>212</b>. The terminal antenna <b>234</b> is operable for communicating over an approved radio frequency. A suitable radio transmitter/receiver to mount to the wireless computer terminal is a Lucent Extended 802.11 radio with a cable for using an external antenna. A suitable terminal antenna <b>234</b> for mounting to the horizontal tray <b>212</b> is a whip antenna used in DOS VMT products (1380/1390, 1320/1330). In particular, the wireless computer terminal may establish a radio-frequency communication channel <b>236</b> with a distributed patient-care computer network <b>238</b> through an antenna <b>240</b> connected to a network access point <b>242</b>. This network access point <b>242</b> is typically located in an enclosure <b>244</b> located above the ceiling of the hospital room. The network access point <b>242</b>, in turn, allows the wireless computer terminal to communicate with the distributed patient-care computer network <b>238</b>. For example, the network access point <b>242</b> may be a RANGELAN2 7500 Series Access Point manufactured by PROXIM, INC. of Mountain View, Calif.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 9A-9D are a series of side views of the mobile workstation <b>210</b> illustrating the operation of an adjustable-height horizontal tray <b>212</b> and the display screen <b>224</b>. FIG. 9A shows the mobile workstation <b>210</b> with the height-adjustable horizontal tray <b>212</b> in a vertically lowered position. To raise the tray <b>212</b>, the operator places his or her hand through an access opening <b>246</b> in the side of the tray housing <b>218</b>. The operator then lifts the release lever <b>228</b>, which releases a stop in the gas-spring height adjustment mechanism (not shown) in the vertical beam <b>226</b>. The operator then raises or lowers the horizontal tray <b>212</b> while holding the release lever <b>228</b> in a raised position.</p>
    <p>Assistance provided by the gas-spring height adjustment mechanism allows the operator to change the height of the horizontal tray <b>212</b> with little effort. Once the horizontal tray <b>212</b> is at a desired height, represented by the height shown in FIG. 9B, the operator releases the lever <b>228</b>, which locks the tray <b>212</b> at the desired height. With this type of mechanism, the operator can quickly and easily place the horizontal tray <b>212</b> at virtually any height within the adjustment range of the gas-spring height adjustment mechanism. The assistance provided by the gas-spring height adjustment is ergonomically desirable in that it avoids back strain or other lifting problems that could otherwise be encountered by operators using the mobile workstation <b>210</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 9C illustrates the mobile workstation <b>210</b> with the display screen <b>224</b> in a vertical position. A tiltable bracket <b>248</b> attaches the display screen <b>224</b> to the horizontal tray <b>212</b>. The tiltable bracket <b>248</b> maintains the display screen <b>224</b> in a number of selectable rotational positions relative to the tray <b>212</b> so that the display screen <b>224</b> is in front of users for ease of visibility. The rotational range of the tiltable bracket <b>248</b> is preferably about 30 degrees rearward from vertical. That is, the tiltable bracket <b>248</b> preferably allows the display screen <b>224</b> to be rotated from the position shown in FIG. 9C to the position shown in FIG. <b>9</b>D. The tiltable bracket <b>248</b> could also be configured to allow the display screen <b>224</b> to rotate forward through a similar rotational range.</p>
    <p>It should be understood that the term “substantially vertical” may include a range about a strictly vertical orientation, represented by the 30 degree range illustrated by FIGS. 9C-9D. For example, the term “substantially vertical” includes configurations in which the bracket <b>248</b> maintains the display screen <b>224</b> in a strictly vertical orientation, or at a fixed rotational orientation with a vertical component, or within a range of rotational orientations including orientations that include vertical components. Alternatively, the display screen <b>224</b> could be supported in a substantially horizontal position, for example by a drawer or pull-out tray located above or under the horizontal tray <b>212</b>. Other locations for the display screen <b>224</b> may be preferred in certain environments. For example, the display screen <b>224</b> could be mounted to the side of the horizontal tray <b>212</b>, to the underside of the horizontal tray <b>212</b>, to the dolly assembly <b>216</b>, to the vertical beam <b>226</b>, and so forth.</p>
    <p>The tiltable bracket <b>248</b> imparts sufficient rotational resistance to maintain the display screen <b>224</b>, with an associated computer terminal (not shown), at any of the rotational aspects within the rotational range defined by the tiltable bracket <b>248</b>. At the same time, the rotational resistance imparted by the tiltable bracket <b>248</b> is pliant enough to allow the operator to change the rotational orientation of the display screen <b>224</b> with one hand. For example, the operator may easily adjust the angle of the display screen <b>224</b> to avoid glare on the display screen <b>224</b>. A clutch mechanism similar to that discussed with reference to FIG. 7 may be used to allow selective rotation of the display screen <b>224</b>.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 10A-10B are perspective views of the mobile workstation <b>210</b> showing the operation of a pull-out keyboard tray <b>250</b>, which is supported by the tray housing <b>218</b> attached to the underside of the horizontal tray <b>212</b>. The pull-out keyboard tray <b>250</b> slides from an inner position, shown in FIG. 10A, to an outer position, shown in FIG. 10B, along conventional rollers (not shown) within a conventional roller guide slots (not shown). Typically, rollers mounted to the bottom side of the keyboard tray <b>250</b> fit within roller guide slots attached to the top side of the tray housing <b>218</b>. A keyboard (not shown) fits within the pull-out keyboard tray <b>250</b>. The pull-out keyboard tray <b>250</b> is to detent when fully extended away from the front edge of the tray housing <b>218</b>, permitting the operator to type on the keyboard without the keyboard tray <b>250</b> sliding back into the tray housing <b>218</b>. When the pull-out keyboard tray <b>250</b> is in the retracted position, the keyboard tray <b>250</b> will not slide out during movement or transport of the mobile workstation <b>210</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 10B, the pull-out keyboard tray <b>250</b> can be extended outward from the front end of the tray housing <b>218</b>. The rollers on the bottom of the pull-out keyboard tray <b>250</b> permit the pull-out tray <b>250</b> to roll forward within the roller guide slots along the length of the top side of the tray housing <b>218</b>. The roller guide slots have a physical stop at the front end of the tray housing <b>218</b>. When a roller makes contact with the physical stop at the front end of the tray housing <b>218</b>, the pull-out keyboard tray <b>250</b> cannot be extended any further from the front edge of the tray housing <b>218</b>.</p>
    <p>In FIGS. 10A-10B, the top portion of a rectangular cover for the vertical beam <b>226</b> has been removed, showing an underlying shaft <b>252</b> and a power cable <b>254</b> connecting the power unit <b>230</b> to the power converter (not shown). This shaft <b>252</b> connects to the gas-spring height adjustment mechanism <b>256</b> that allows adjustment of the height of the horizontal tray <b>212</b>. The gas-spring height adjustment mechanism <b>256</b>, which is located at the bottom of the vertical beam <b>226</b>, sits on top of the dolly assembly <b>216</b>. This dolly assembly includes an arched cross-beam <b>258</b> that connects to two horizontal runner beams <b>260</b> <i>a-b</i>. Two casters, represented by the caster <b>262</b>, are connected to the bottom sides of each horizontal runner beam <b>260</b> <i>a-b</i>. For example, a suitable size caster is a conventional 5″ caster. The power unit <b>230</b> is mounted below the arched cross beam <b>258</b> with a support bracket <b>264</b>, which connects between the horizontal runner beams <b>260</b> <i>a-b. </i> </p>
    <p>FIGS. 10A-10B also show that the top side <b>266</b> of the horizontal tray <b>212</b> defines a substantially horizontal work surface. The tiltable bracket <b>248</b> supports the display screen <b>224</b> so that the elongate dimension <b>268</b> is substantially vertical and the relatively slender dimension <b>270</b> is substantially horizontal. Because the display screen <b>224</b> is vertically mounted, the display screen <b>224</b> does not occupy a substantial portion of the top surface <b>266</b> of the horizontal tray <b>212</b>, which allows this area to be used as a work surface. It will be understood that the term “substantially vertical” includes a range of orientations because the display screen <b>224</b> may rotate through a rotational range about a strictly perpendicular orientation.</p>
    <p>FIG. 11A is a side view of the horizontal tray <b>212</b> and the attached tray housing <b>218</b> showing the access opening <b>246</b> and the release lever <b>228</b> for raising and lowering the horizontal tray <b>212</b>. The release lever <b>228</b> operates the gas-spring height adjustment mechanism <b>256</b> previously shown in FIGS. 10A-10B. The access opening <b>246</b> in the side wall of the tray housing <b>218</b> provides convenient operator access to actuate the release lever <b>228</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 11B is a perspective view of the horizontal tray <b>212</b> showing the access opening <b>246</b> and the release lever <b>228</b> for raising and lowering the horizontal tray <b>212</b>.

For example, the power unit <b>430</b> may reside between two metal beams in the dolly assembly <b>416</b> at the lower end of the chassis <b>414</b>. A suitable power unit <b>430</b> is a 26 Amp-Hour battery providing a regulated 10-16 Volt output at 40 watts with an automatic low power cut-off. The extended-life battery may be a 12-Volt sealed lead acid battery, and the battery charger may be a 120-Volt AC to 16-Volt DC converter.</p>
    <p>The power unit <b>430</b> typically includes a first status-indicator light to inform the user when the AC power is being supplied, a second status-indicator light to inform the user when the battery needs recharging, and a seven-level battery status-indicator light. The power unit <b>430</b> may also include a sound indicator that beeps to inform the user when the battery needs recharging. When plugged into an AC outlet, the battery charger will charge both the extended-life battery and operate the wireless computer terminal. The extended-life battery can be recharged by plugging the power cord <b>432</b> into a standard 120-volt AC outlet. When not in use, the recoil mechanism automatically recoils the power cord <b>432</b> into the power unit <b>430</b>.</p>
    <p>The wireless computer terminal inside the mobile workstation <b>410</b> communicates through a radio transmitter/receiver terminal antenna <b>434</b> attached to the top of the horizontal tray <b>412</b>. The terminal antenna <b>434</b> is operable for communicating over an approved radio frequency. In particular, the wireless computer terminal may establish a radio-frequency communication channel with a distributed patient-care computer network as previously shown and described in FIG. <b>8</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 17 is a rear right side perspective view of the mobile workstation <b>410</b> in FIG. 16. A tiltable bracket <b>436</b> attaches the display screen <b>426</b> to the horizontal tray <b>412</b>. The tiltable bracket <b>436</b> maintains the display screen <b>426</b> in a number of selectable rotational positions relative to the tray <b>412</b>. The rotational range of the tiltable bracket <b>436</b> is preferably about 30 degrees rearward from vertical. That is, the tiltable bracket <b>436</b> preferably allows the display screen <b>426</b> to be rotated left to right. The tiltable bracket <b>436</b> could also be configured to allow the display screen <b>426</b> to rotate forward through a similar rotational range.</p>
    <p>It should be understood that the term “substantially vertical” may include a range about a strictly vertical orientation, represented by a 30 degree range. For example, the term “substantially vertical” includes configurations in which the bracket <b>436</b> maintains the display screen <b>426</b> in a strictly vertical orientation, or at a fixed rotational orientation with a vertical component, or within a range of rotational orientations including orientations that include vertical components. Alternatively, the display screen <b>426</b> could be supported in a substantially horizontal position, for example by a drawer or pull-out tray located above or under the horizontal tray <b>412</b>. Other locations for the display screen <b>426</b> may be preferred in certain environments. For example, the display screen <b>426</b> could be mounted to the side of the horizontal tray <b>412</b>, to the underside of the horizontal tray <b>412</b>, to the dolly assembly <b>416</b>, to the vertical beam <b>428</b>, and so forth.</p>
    <p>The tiltable bracket <b>436</b> imparts sufficient rotational resistance to maintain the display screen <b>426</b>, with an associated computer terminal (not shown), at any of the rotational aspects within the rotational range defined by the tiltable bracket <b>436</b>. At the same time, the rotational resistance imparted by the tiltable bracket <b>436</b> is pliant enough to allow the operator to change the rotational orientation of the display screen <b>426</b> with one hand. For example, the operator may easily adjust the angle of the display screen <b>426</b> to avoid glare on the display screen <b>426</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 18 is a rear right side perspective view of the mobile workstation <b>410</b> in FIG. 16 with the pull-out keyboard tray in the extended position. The pull-out keyboard tray <b>424</b> slides from an inner position, shown in FIGS. 16-17, to an outer position, shown in FIG. 18, along conventional rollers (not shown) within a conventional roller guide slots (not shown). Typically, rollers mounted to the bottom side of the keyboard tray <b>424</b> fit within roller guide slots attached to the top side of the tray housing <b>418</b>. A keyboard (not shown) fits within the pull-out keyboard tray <b>424</b>. The pull-out keyboard tray <b>424</b> is to detent when fully extended away from the front edge of the tray housing <b>418</b>, permitting the operator to type on the keyboard without the keyboard tray <b>424</b> sliding back into the tray housing <b>418</b>. When the pull-out keyboard tray <b>424</b> is in the retracted position, the keyboard tray <b>424</b> will not slide out during movement or transport of the mobile workstation <b>410</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 18, the pull-out keyboard tray <b>424</b> can be extended outward from the front end of the tray housing <b>418</b>. The rollers on the bottom of the pull-out keyboard tray <b>424</b> permit the pull-out tray <b>424</b> to roll forward within the roller guide slots along the length of the top side of the tray housing <b>418</b>. The roller guide slots have a physical stop at the front end of the tray housing <b>418</b>. When a roller makes contact with the physical stop at the front end of the tray housing <b>418</b>, the pull-out keyboard tray <b>424</b> cannot be extended any further from the front edge of the tray housing <b>418</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 19 is a front right side perspective view of the mobile workstation <b>410</b> in FIG. 16 with the pull-out keyboard tray <b>424</b> in the extended position. The top portion of a rectangular cover for the vertical beam <b>428</b> has been removed, showing an underlying shaft <b>438</b> and a power cable <b>440</b> connecting the power unit <b>430</b> to the power converter (not shown). This shaft <b>438</b> connects to the gas-spring height adjustment mechanism (not shown) that allows adjustment of the height of the horizontal tray <b>412</b>. The gas-spring height adjustment mechanism, which is located at the bottom of the vertical beam <b>428</b>, sits on top of the dolly assembly <b>416</b>. This dolly assembly <b>416</b> includes an arched cross-beam <b>442</b> that connects to two horizontal runner beams <b>444</b> <i>a-b</i>. Two casters, represented by the caster <b>446</b>, are connected to the bottom sides of each horizontal runner beam <b>444</b> <i>a-b</i>. For example, a suitable size caster is a conventional 5″ caster. The power unit <b>430</b> is mounted below the arched cross beam <b>442</b> with a support bracket <b>448</b>, which connects between the horizontal runner beams <b>444</b> <i>a-b. </i> </p>
    <p>FIG. 20 is a side view of the mobile workstation <b>410</b> shown in FIG. <b>16</b>. The mounting bracket <b>420</b> attaches to the top surface of the horizontal tray <b>412</b> permitting a wireless computer terminal (not shown) to be stored on the top of the horizontal tray <b>412</b>. The tiltable bracket <b>436</b>, supporting the display screen <b>426</b>, mounts to the top surface of the mounting bracket <b>420</b>. A touch-pin display interface (not shown) located on the back of the wireless computer terminal provides an interface between the computer terminal and the display screen <b>426</b>.</p>
    <p>The tray housing <b>418</b> mounts to the underside of the horizontal tray <b>412</b>. The pull-out keyboard tray <b>424</b> supporting a keyboard (not shown), mounts to the front portion of the top surface of the tray housing <b>418</b>. The wireless computer terminal may include a communication interface, such as an optical interface, for communicating data between the computer terminal and the keyboard. A conventional electrical connection allows the keyboard to communicate keystrokes to the computer terminal. This type of operation permits an operator to easily remove the computer terminal from the mounting bracket <b>420</b>, or to remove the keyboard from the pull-out keyboard tray <b>424</b>.</p>
    <p>The back mounting bracket <b>422</b> or wiring tray attaches to the rear portion of the underside of the horizontal tray <b>412</b>. The back mounting bracket <b>422</b> or wiring tray supports the power converter (not shown) for supplying power to the wireless computer terminal. A touch-pin battery charging terminal (not shown) or other conventional electrical connection, such as an automobile adaptor plug, located on the back of the wireless computer terminal provides an interface between the computer terminal and the power converter within the back mounting bracket <b>422</b>. The power converter, in turn, is connected to the power unit <b>430</b> by the power cable (shown in FIG. 19 as <b>440</b>). The power unit <b>430</b> can then be plugged into a standard 120 Volt AC outlet with the power cord <b>432</b>.</p>
    <p>An access opening <b>450</b> in the side of the tray housing permits operator access to actuate a release lever <b>452</b> for raising and lowering the horizontal tray <b>412</b>. The release lever <b>452</b> operates the gas-spring height adjustment mechanism (not shown). Typically, the release lever <b>452</b> has a tee or a paddle on the end, so that an operator can conveniently actuate the release lever <b>452</b> thereby raising or lowering the gas-spring height adjustment mechanism.</p>
