    <p num="p-0005">This invention relates generally to the screening of financial transactions. More particularly, embodiments of this invention relate to screening suspicious transfers of money.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading> <p num="p-0006">Money transfer locations provide users with the ability to transfer money to another party in another part of the world. For example, parents can transfer money to their child at college during emergency situations. Similarly, a user faced with a late payment of a bill can wire or transfer funds to their credit card company so as to avoid a late fee. These are but a few examples of money transfers that take place.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">These transfers can be conducted in person at a money transfer location or via a network connection. For example, a user might go to a Western Union location and conduct a transfer of money to a receiving party at a location in another state or country. Alternatively, a user might use a website such as Western Union to conduct a transfer of funds to the receiving party. Furthermore, one might even use a touch tone telephone system to provide banking information and account information to route funds to the receiving party. Thus, a variety of mechanisms can be used to initiate the money transfer. The money transfer service can then facilitate the transfer of funds to the receiving party through its own transfer network. Thus, a user who places a money transfer request with the money transfer service can rely on the money transfer service to convey the transferred funds to the receiving party and generate a confirmation that the transfer has taken place. All this can take place without the use of the banking networks. Thus, the fees associated with bank transfers can be avoided to the customer's advantage.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">With the convenience of these money transfers, also comes the associated problem that disreputable people will try to misuse the system. For example, criminals might try to use the system to launder money. Similarly, terrorist organizations might try to use the system to convey funds to operatives in distant locations without traceability. These and other potential criminal or fraudulent activities exist just as they exist with normal banking channels.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">Thus, there is a need for a system that can facilitate the detection of improper money transfers. Furthermore, there is a need for a system that will allow the management of a money transfer service to be alerted to potential misconduct by the transferring parties.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0010">One embodiment of the invention provides a method of monitoring an attempted money transfer through a money transfer service. This method can be implemented by receiving from a user a request to transfer an amount of money to a receiving party; obtaining data from a database for at least one previously requested transfer by that user; utilizing this data to determine whether this request to transfer the amount of money violates a screening condition of the money transfer service; and, in response to a positive determination that the request to transfer the amount of money violates the screening condition, automatically prompting the operator of the money transfer service to request further information from the user. The operator can be conveyed a question or a series of questions to ask the user about the request to transfer the money.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">Furthermore, according to another embodiment of the invention, a software product can be provided for use by a money transfer service to facilitate the method outlined above.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">According to various aspects of the invention, a series of questions can be provided to an operator, in which the operator can inquire of the user the specific details surrounding the money transfer. For example, the operator can inquire of the user whether the user has supporting documentation to authenticate the need to transfer the designated amount. Similarly, the operator could request the user to provide further identifying information, such as an invoice that reflects the amount of money being transferred. In addition, the operator can be prompted to contact the receiving party so as to determine whether the receiving party is a legitimate receiving party.</p>

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading> <p num="p-0019">The present embodiments of the invention provide a system that facilitates the screening of money transfers. According to one embodiment of the invention, suspicious transfers can be screened and identified for further checking by the money transfer service. Thus, an automated procedure can be implemented to invoke the intervention by a human operator for further screening of an attempted transaction. In this way, the vast majority of attempted money transfers that are legitimate can be processed while those that are fraudulent or illegal in some other manner can be more readily detected. Furthermore, it also facilitates an efficient use of human operators to interact with those transactions that are more likely to be fraudulent.</p>
    <p num="p-0020">Generally, money transfers are accomplished either in person or via a network system, such as the internet or public service telephone network (PSTN). For example, Western Union provides a series of service centers throughout the United States as well as the world where users can enter the facility and place a request to transfer funds to a receiving party at another locale somewhere in the world. This vast network of service centers is widely used by users who want to transfer funds to their receiving party immediately rather than waiting for a check to be sent through the mail system. Similarly, some banks charge a large fee for transferring money from the user's account to the receiving party's account. In addition, the receiving party may not have a bank account to receive funds. Furthermore, the service centers can have extended hours that allow a receiving party to obtain the funds after normal banking hours or even on weekends. Thus, the common example where money transfer services are utilized is a parent transferring an amount of money to his or her child in a distant state. In such a situation, the child might not have a bank account, but will be in need of immediately receiving the funds. Thus, the money transfer service greatly facilitates such an immediate transfer.</p>
    <p num="p-0021">Some criminal activity has been detected in the past of criminals using the money transfer services. For example, some criminal organizations will use money transfer services to transfer money to their operatives in distant states. Similarly, the money transfer service can be used to transfer funds and thus launder cash received through criminal activity. More alarming, is the potential use of money transfer services by terrorist organizations to transfer money from foreign countries to operatives in the United States. These transactions can be conducted with cash as opposed to the banking system which has account numbers. Thus, there is less likelihood of identifying terrorists through such money transfers.</p>
    <p num="p-0022">In an attempt to prevent such criminal activity from occurring, money transfer services have implemented a variety of rules to prevent abuse of the system. For example, a cumulative amount for transfers has been implemented to screen users who might be abusing the system. Thus, for example, if a user conducts multiple transactions above a predetermined maximum number of transactions within a given period of time, the system will identify the user as potentially engaging in suspicious activity. Similarly, if the user attempts to transfer an excessive amount of money through the money transfer service in one or more transactions, the user will be identified as potentially engaging in suspicious activity.</p>
    <p num="p-0023">Thus, according to one embodiment of the invention, a system is provided to facilitate the screening of users who are suspected of abusing the money transfer service. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary method of implementing such a system. According to the flowchart <b>100</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a money transfer system receives a request from a user to transfer an amount of money, as shown in block <b>104</b>. This request to transfer an amount of money can be received via an in-store request at one of the money transfer service locations or via a network request from the user interacting with the money transfer service on-line or via a telephone network. Thus, there are a variety of ways in which the user can initiate the money transfer request. In block <b>108</b>, a money transfer service database will obtain data for at least one previously requested transfer by the user. This data can be utilized as shown in block <b>112</b> to determine whether the request to transfer the amount of money violates a screening condition of the money transfer service. Block <b>116</b> illustrates that in response to a positive determination that the request to transfer the amount of money violates a predetermined screening condition, an operator is automatically prompted to request further information from the user about the transfer request. Finally, block <b>120</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows that the operator is then prompted with at least one question to ask the user about the request to transfer the amount of money.</p>
    <p num="p-0024"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>2</b> <i>b </i>illustrate another embodiment of the invention in more detail, according to flowchart <b>200</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> <i>a</i>, a user requests to transfer an amount of money as illustrated in block <b>204</b>. In block <b>208</b>, data is obtained from a database for at least one previously requested transfer by the user. This data is utilized to determine whether the request to transfer the amount of money violates the screening condition established by the money transfer service as shown in block <b>212</b>. In block <b>214</b>, a determination is made as to whether the request to transfer the amount of money violates the screening condition. If the request does not violate the screening condition, block <b>216</b> shows that the transfer request is authorized. Thus, the transfer service can proceed with additional details of the transfer request, such as confirming the presence of the amount of funds being transferred. However, if the screening condition is violated, an operator of the money transfer service is prompted to request further information from the user as shown in block <b>218</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0025"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates examples of conditions used to screen attempted money transfers. In flowchart <b>400</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an exemplary scenario is illustrated for detecting potential violations of the money transfer service rules. In block <b>404</b>, a determination is made as to whether the frequency of money transfers by a user exceeds a maximum value. For example, by obtaining previous transfer requests of the user from the database of previously attempted transfers, a determination is made of the frequency of transactions by the user. The more often the user utilizes the transfer service, the greater the likelihood that the user is engaging in criminal activity. Thus, frequency can serve as one screening mechanism. If the frequency does not exceed a pre-established value, a second check can be made as to whether the total amount of money being transferred by the user over a predetermined time period exceeds a maximum amount as shown in block <b>408</b>. This predetermined time period can be limited to an individual transaction or it can be stretched out over a longer period of time. Thus, by determining the aggregate amount of money being transferred during this predetermined time period, this money transfer service can determine whether an excessive amount of money is being transferred by the user. Furthermore, this can also be a useful test even when the user is spreading the transfers to a variety of recipients. Again, if this determination is negative, an additional check can be made as shown in block <b>412</b>. Block <b>412</b> shows that the frequency and the amount of the transactions by the user can be screened to determine whether they exceed maximum amounts. Thus, this serves as yet another screening mechanism to determine if potentially suspicious transfers are being conducted. If any of these exemplary conditions is satisfied, then block <b>416</b> shows that an operator is notified for further screening of the transaction. However, if the screening conditions are not satisfied, the transfer process is allowed to proceed as shown in block <b>420</b>. The conditions are merely examples. Other conditions could also be implemented, as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
    <p num="p-0026">Returning to flowchart <b>200</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> <i>b</i>, once the determination has been made that the transaction requires further screening by a human operator, a second check can be made to determine whether the user has been screened by an operator before. This is shown in block <b>222</b>. If a user has been screened before, the user's case is routed to that previous operator as illustrated in block <b>226</b>. Thus, as shown in block <b>230</b>, this previous operator can interview the user about the present attempted money transfer. In this way, a user who has previously been identified as conducting suspicious transactions will be screened by the same operator who previously screened those suspicious transactions. This provides another layer of security in that the user will be less likely to mislead the operator if the operator has a history of dealing with the user. For example, if a user fabricates a story that an excessive amount of money is being transferred to pay tuition for a student in a distant country, a second attempt with the same fabricated story will be very suspicious to an operator who handles both screenings. Furthermore, just the familiarity of the operator with a user will be beneficial to the screening process as well as the public relations aspect of dealing with customers.</p>
    <p num="p-0027">If a previous operator is determined to exist, the user's case is routed to the previous operator as shown in block <b>226</b>. The previous operator is then prompted to interview the user about the present attempted money transfer as shown in block <b>230</b>. If no previous history with a particular operator exists, flowchart <b>200</b> shows that the user's case is routed to an available operator. Once the user's case is deposited with an operator, flowchart <b>200</b> shows in block <b>234</b> that questions can be conveyed to the operator to inquire with the user about the suspicious money transfer request. This is illustrated further in flowchart <b>300</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0028"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a method <b>300</b> which can be implemented to prompt an operator with a variety of questions or requests for further information. For example, block <b>304</b> shows that the operator can be prompted to request supporting documentation from the user. Block <b>308</b> shows that the operator can be prompted to request an invoice as the supporting documentation. Thus, if the user identifies the money transfer as relating to payment for a product, the program can be coded so as to request the invoice for the product. As another prompt, block <b>316</b> shows that the operator can be asked to request the purpose of the transfer. Thus, a user who provides a plainly fictitious purpose can be denied permission to conduct the transfer. Similarly, block <b>320</b> shows that the operator can be prompted to inquire why the user is not utilizing a bank to conduct the money transfer. Such a question is useful when a large amount of money is being transferred which normally would be transferred through the bank network system. Transfers of large amounts of money historically have been conducted by banks. Therefore, a user transferring such a large amount of money without using a banking network is suspicious. In addition, the operator can be prompted to make an inquiry with the receiving party. Thus, the operator can be prompted to inquire whether the user knows the receiving party as shown in block <b>324</b> or whether the receiving party knows the user. The receiving party can similarly be contacted by the operator as shown in block <b>328</b> to determine whether the receiving party knows the user. Finally, the flowchart <b>300</b> shows that the operator can be prompted to request supporting documentation from the receiving party. Thus, if the user does not have the supporting documentation, for example, the receiving party can be asked to supply such documentation.</p>
    <p num="p-0029">Returning to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the flowchart <b>200</b> illustrates that after the screening process is conducted by the operator that a determination is made as to whether to allow the user to conduct the money transfer. This is illustrated in block <b>238</b>. Thus, the operator can be given final discretion in determining whether the user should be allowed to continue with the transfer request. However, the prompting of the operator with predetermined questions allows a more rigorous and consistent approach to be implemented in the screening process. Therefore, while the ultimate decision can be left to an operator, the screening conditions and/or questions can be predetermined for implementation by the operator. This is more beneficial than systems which leave the determination to the discretion of the operator without any prompting. Namely, such a system can be highly inconsistent depending on which operator reviews the case. By prompting an operator with a series of questions or a computerized selection of follow-up questions based upon answers given to initial questions, the screening process can be highly regimented.</p>
    <p num="p-0030"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an example of implementing a screening service according to another embodiment of the invention. In system <b>600</b> a transaction is conducted via a computer network. A user operating computer <b>604</b> conveys a request for transferring funds to a receiving party at computer <b>608</b> via network <b>612</b>. One example of such a network is the internet. According to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the request is received at a website supported by server <b>616</b> coupled to database <b>620</b>. The server <b>616</b> supports a website that allows the user to enter data identifying the amount of funds to be transferred and the name of the receiving party. Upon receiving the entered information, the server compares the data for the transaction to records stored in database <b>620</b> (as explained previously). Furthermore, server <b>616</b> can conduct the screening process based upon the particulars of the requested transaction as well as based upon prior transactions. Upon identifying the transaction as being a suspicious transaction, server <b>616</b> routes the case to operator <b>624</b>. Operator <b>624</b> can be an operator who previously interacted with the user, or if no such history exists, the available operator at that time. Operator <b>624</b> can then use the public service telephone network <b>628</b> to interview the user <b>604</b> through handsets <b>632</b> and <b>634</b>. This could be conducted in a variety of ways. For example, the operator might initiate the telephone conversation upon receiving notice that the transaction is suspicious. Or, the operator might request that the user contact the operator by telephoning the operator. Similarly, the operator can telephone the receiving party <b>608</b> having handset <b>638</b> to request further information or documentation.</p>
    <p num="p-0031">While <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the internet and telephone based system for conducting and screening a transfer request, a similar system could be implemented where the user attempts to transfer the funds from a physical money transfer service location. Thus, if a user walks into a Western Union Service Center and makes a suspicious transfer request, a terminal at the service counter can be used to prompt the operator conducting the transaction. Alternatively, an operator at a remote service call center could be prompted to telephone the user at the service center location. Thus, according to this embodiment of the invention an operator can be placed in contact with the user and prompted with questions to request further information for the screening process.</p>
    <p num="p-0032"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a block diagram of a typical computing device which can be utilized by the computing devices in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. System <b>500</b> is shown comprised of hardware elements that are electrically coupled via bus <b>508</b>, including a processor <b>501</b>, input device <b>502</b>, output device <b>503</b>, storage device <b>504</b>, computer-readable storage media reader <b>505</b> <i>a</i>, communications system <b>506</b> processing acceleration (e.g., DSP or special-purpose processors) <b>507</b> and memory <b>509</b>. Computer-readable storage media reader <b>505</b> <i>a </i>is further connected to computer-readable storage media <b>505</b> <i>b</i>, the combination comprehensively representing remote, local, fixed and/or removable storage devices plus storage media, memory, etc. for temporarily and/or more permanently containing computer-readable information, which can include storage device <b>504</b>, memory <b>509</b> and/or any other such accessible system <b>500</b> resource. System <b>500</b> also comprises software elements (shown as being currently located within working memory <b>591</b>) including an operating system <b>592</b> and other code <b>593</b>, such as programs, applets, data and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0033">System <b>500</b> offers extensive flexibility and configurability. Thus, for example, a single architecture might be utilized to implement one or more servers that can be further configured in accordance with currently desirable protocols, protocol variations, extensions, etc. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that substantial variations may well be utilized in accordance with more specific application requirements. Customized hardware might also be utilized and/or particular elements might be implemented in hardware, software (including so-called “portable software,” such as applets) or both. Further, while connection to other computing devices such as network input/output devices (not shown) may be employed, it is to be understood that wired, wireless, modem and/or other connection or connections to other computing devices might also be utilized. Distributed processing, multiple site viewing, information forwarding, collaboration, remote information retrieval and merging, and related capabilities are each contemplated. Operating system utilization will also vary depending on the particular host devices and/or process types (e.g. computer, appliance, portable device, etc.) and certainly not all system <b>500</b> components will be required in all cases.</p>
    <p num="p-0034">While various embodiments of the invention have been described as methods or apparatus for implementing the invention, it should be understood that the invention can be implemented through code coupled to a computer, e.g., code resident on a computer or accessible by the computer. For example, software and databases could be utilized to implement many of the methods discussed above. Thus, in addition to embodiments where the invention is accomplished by hardware, it is also noted that these embodiments can be accomplished through the use of an article of manufacture comprised of a computer usable medium having a computer readable program code embodied therein, which causes the enablement of the functions disclosed in this description. Therefore, it is desired that embodiments of the invention also be considered protected by this patent in their program code means as well.</p>
    <p num="p-0035">It is also envisioned that embodiments of the invention could be accomplished as computer signals embodied in a carrier wave, as well as signals (e.g., electrical and optical) propagated through a transmission medium. Thus, the various information discussed above could be formatted in a structure, such as a data structure, and transmitted as an electrical signal through a transmission medium or stored on a computer readable medium.</p>
    <p num="p-0036">It is also noted that many of the structures, materials, and acts recited herein can be recited as means for performing a function or steps for performing a function. Therefore, it should be understood that such language is entitled to cover all such structures, materials, or acts disclosed within this specification and their equivalents.</p>
    <p num="p-0037">It is thought that the apparatuses and methods of the embodiments of the present invention and many of its attendant advantages will be understood from this specification and it will be apparent that various changes may be made in the form, construction, and arrangement of the parts thereof without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention or sacrificing all of its material advantages, the form herein before described being merely exemplary embodiments thereof</p>
