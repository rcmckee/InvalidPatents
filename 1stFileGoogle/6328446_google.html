    <heading>RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading> <p>This Application is a Continuation-In-Part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/397,949, filed on Mar. 3, 1995 now abandoned for PRODUCTION OF OPTICAL ELEMENTS.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>The present invention relates to optical elements and to methods of making optical elements. More specifically, the present invention relates to an optical element that incorporates a laminate to provide a functional property and to a method of incorporating the functional property in the optical element by adherence of the laminate to an optical power lens element.</p>
    <p>2. Background of the Art</p>
    <p>Manufacturers have encountered and overcome numerous technical challenges presented by chemical compounds that are newly incorporated into optical elements, such as ophthalmic lenses. First, there were new formulations for inorganic glasses. Those new glass formulations required development of new processing steps and conditions, as well as new grinding and polishing techniques. Later, industry focus shifted to thermoset resins and polymers, such as allyl diglycol carbonate, one brand of which is sold under the CR-39® trademark of PPG Industries, Inc. A more recent development involves manufacture of ophthalmic lenses using thermoplastic materials and polymers, such as polycarbonate polymers.</p>
    <p>Polycarbonate is an amorphous, thermoplastic material that has mechanical properties that are very desirable for ophthalmic lenses. For example, ophthalmic lenses made of polycarbonate have unusually high impact resistance and strength which make the lenses surprisingly shatter-resistant. Also, the relatively low specific gravity of polycarbonate makes it possible to significantly decrease the weight of polycarbonate lenses, as compared to glass or CR-39® lenses. Polycarbonate is highly transparent and has a desirably high refractive index for ophthalmic lens applications. Furthermore, the good thermal properties of molten polycarbonate makes the material conducive to efficient processing by conventional techniques, such as injection molding.</p>
    <p>Despite the advantages of the material, incorporation of polycarbonate into ophthalmic lens manufacture has not been without problems. For example, the hardness of the material necessitated development of grinding and polishing techniques different from techniques used for glass and CR-39® lenses. Additional challenges remain that have not been satisfactorily addressed to date. Some of these challenges relate to incorporation of functional properties into lenses made of polycarbonate. Functional properties include features, such a) as light or other radiation filtering, and b) cosmetic and durability features, which may be incorporated into an optical lens to impart or modify lens characteristics, other than optical power or magnification characteristics. Some examples of functional properties include light polarization, photochromism, tint, color, decor, indicia, hardness, and abrasion resistance.</p>
    <p>There are various examples of shortcomings relating to polycarbonate ophthalmic lenses and to techniques for manufacturing polycarbonate ophthalmic lenses. For example, no method presently exists for making polarized polycarbonate lenses capable of meeting ophthalmic prescription specifications—that is, creating polarized polycarbonate lenses with different focal powers. Also, no method presently exists for quickly and efficiently making high quality photochromic polycarbonate lenses. Furthermore, no method is available for efficiently and effectively incorporating functional properties into ophthalmic lenses made of new materials or materials that have not yet been adapted to ophthalmic lens manufacture.</p>
    <p>Numerous methods for incorporating polarizing properties into lenses made of material other than thermoplastic material are known. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,051,054 to Crandon describes a method of providing a glass lens with a film of light-polarizing material. Also, U.S. Pat. No. 4,495,015 to Petcen describes a method of laminating a thermoset/thermoplastic wafer to an ophthalmic glass lens.</p>
    <p>Various patents disclose methods of incorporating a polarizing film or wafer within a lens cast of thermoset material. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,786,119 to Ortlieb discloses a laminated plate of polarizing plastic material that is formed into a polarizing screen. The polarizing screen is placed within a mold which is filled with polymerizable or polycondensible liquid resin. U.S. Pat. No. 3,846,013 discloses a light-polarizing element formed by sandwiching light-polarizing material between thin layers of optical quality transparent polymeric material. The light-polarizing element is placed within a mold, and a polymerizable monomer is placed in the mold on either side of the light-polarizing element.</p>
    <p>U.S. Pat. No. 3,940,304 to Schuler discloses a shaped light-polarizing synthetic plastic member that is disposed between layers of an optical quality synthetic monomeric material in a mold. A monomeric material is placed within the mold and polymerized to form a composite synthetic plastic light-polarizing lens structure. U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,029 to Blum discloses a plastic wafer that may include polarizing features. The plastic wafer is inserted into a mold between liquid monomer molding material. The mold is then subjected to oven-curing to polymerize the liquid monomer. Additionally, U.S. Pat. No. 5,286,419 to van Ligten et al. discloses a shaped polarizing film that is embedded in pre-gelled resin. The resin is cured to form a light polarizing lens.</p>
    <p>However, despite the availability of these methods for incorporating a polarizing film or wafer within a lens cast of thermoset material, a need remains for an improved polarizing lens. For example, delamination of cast polarizing lenses remains a significant problem. Also, cast lenses are relatively heavy and offer less than adequate levels of impact and shatter resistance. Finally, manufactures continue to encounter difficulties making polarizing cast lenses with optimum refractive index values.</p>
    <p>Another reference, U.S. Pat. No. 5,051,309 to Kawaki et al., concerns a polarizing plate that is made by laminating polycarbonate film on both sides of a polarizing thin layer. The polarizing thin layer is composed of a polymeric film and a dichroic dye oriented on the polymeric film. According to the patent, suitable uses of the polarizing plate include goggles and sunglasses. However, the polarizing plate of U.S. Pat. No. 5,051,309 would not be suitable for use as an optical lens capable of meeting ophthalmic prescription specifications. For example, the polycarbonate film included in the polarizing plate of this patent lacks the material integrity needed for successful grinding and polishing of polycarbonate optical elements to prescription specifications. Polycarbonate that is ground and polished to make optical elements must have sufficient material integrity to withstand the heat and pressure generated during grinding and polishing operations. The lack of material integrity of the polycarbonate film used in the Kawaki polarizing plate would affect cosmetic properties, as well as, the impact strength of any prescription specification optical elements made by grinding and polishing the polycarbonate film.</p>
    <p>As noted, another challenge concerns incorporation of photochromic properties into polycarbonate lenses. For example, present polycarbonate lenses that include photochromic material offer marginal, and even unacceptable, photochromic properties and cosmetic qualities. Indeed, no method presently exists for making high quality photochromic polycarbonate lenses.</p>
    <p>Two current methods of incorporating organic photochromic dyes into thermoplastic materials, such as polycarbonate, involve either inclusion of organic photochromic dye throughout the thermoplastic material or imbibition of photochromic dye into a surface of the thermoplastic material. Existing techniques, such as injection molding, for including organic photochromic dyes throughout thermoplastic materials, such as polycarbonate, typically do not yield satisfactory results. It is believed that the unsatisfactory results occur for several reasons, including the relatively high temperatures required for satisfactory injection molding and including the relatively high glass transition temperatures of many thermoplastics, such as polycarbonate.</p>
    <p>For example, naphthopyrans, spironaphthopyrans, and spiro-oxazines that are co-melted with thermoplastics typically break down when exposed to the relatively high temperatures present during injection molding. This has been found to be especially true when the thermoplastic material is polycarbonate resin. As another example, polycarbonate, has a stiff molecular structure that is reflected by the relatively high glass transition temperature of polycarbonate. Therefore, even in the absence of photochromic compound break down, the stiff molecular structure of polycarbonate would be expected to substantially inhibit full activation of the photochromic dye, since the photochromic dye must go through a geometric transformation in the polycarbonate to activate.</p>
    <p>The present inventors conducted an experiment to examine these photochromic compound break down and activation inhibition phenomena. The experiment involved co-melting mixing equal concentrations of an organic photochromic dye into polycarbonate resin and into cellulose acetate butyrate resin. Then, a sheet of the polycarbonate/photochromic dye mixture and a sheet of the cellulose acetate butyrate/photochromic dye mixture were cast. It was observed that the photochromic activity of the photochromic dye in the polycarbonate was approximately one half that of the photochromic activity of the photochromic dye in the cellulose acetate butyrate, under the same conditions of ultraviolet light exposure.</p>
    <p>Imbibition of photochromic dyes into surfaces of thermoplastic materials, such as polycarbonate, also yields unsatisfactory results, which are again believed related, at least in part, to the relatively high glass transition temperatures of many thermoplastics, such as polycarbonate. For example, polycarbonate has a stiff molecular structure, as reflected by the relatively high glass transition temperature of polycarbonate. Poor photochromic dye imbibition results obtained with polycarbonate are believed related to the stiff molecular structure of polycarbonate. More specifically, it is thought that the stiff molecular structure substantially prevents the photochromic dye from penetrating into the polycarbonate.</p>
    <p>Modification of the surface structure of polycarbonate by treatment with a solvent is said to improve imbibition of photochromic compounds into polycarbonate. In particular, U.S. Pat. No. 5,268,231 to Knapp-Hayes discloses that cyclohexanone is one of the more effective solvents for modifying the polycarbonate surface structure to accept photochromic compounds. However, the present inventors have completed experiments following the methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,268,231 and have found that this method leaves the surface of the polycarbonate with a rough, orange-peel type texture that is unacceptable for ophthalmic lenses. For example, the rough texture of the treated polycarbonate causes irregular and unpredictable optical effects in the treated polycarbonate.</p>
    <p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,531,940 describes a photochromic lens and a method for manufacturing a photochromic lens comprising four alternative methods. In a first method, an uncured resin is positioned between a mold surface and a preformed lens. The resin is cured to the shape of the lens and the composite lens is impregnated with photochromic material. In a second method, an uncured resin containing a photochromically active ingredient is positioned between the lens and the mold, and the resin cured to bond it to the lens. In a third process, an uncured resin containing photochromic ingredients is positioned against the mold surface and partially cured to a gel to form a coated mold. Then a second uncured resin and then a lens preform are positioned over the gel layer in the mold. A cure step is performed top secure all of the layers together. In a fourth process, a second uncured resin is disposed between a convex surface of the lens preform and the molding surface of the mold. The second uncured resin is cured to a gel state on the mold to form a covered mold. Then the first uncured resin is positioned adjacent the gel and then the lens preform positioned over the first uncured resin. A final cure step is then provided. In all embodiments, a mold must be available that is approximately specific to the curvature of the face of the lens facing that mold surface, so that the cast and cured resin layer is of uniform thickness and conforms to the same curvature of both the mold and the convex surface of the lens.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>An ophthalmic element comprises an injection molded, polymeric ophthalmic lens having a concave surface and a convex surface, and a laminate bonded to the injection molded, polymeric ophthalmic lens, the laminate comprising, in the following order: a) a first resinous layer, b) a functional layer selected from the group consisting of a light polarizing layer and a photochromic layer, and c) a second resinous layer, the first resinous layer being bonded to the convex surface of the injection molded, polymeric ophthalmic lens. The polymeric ophthalmic lens preferably comprises a polycarbonate resin. The first resin layer preferably is directly bonded to the polymeric ophthalmic lens. As an alternative structure, the first resinous layer may be adhesively bonded to the polymeric ophthalmic lens or may be fused to the polymeric ophthalmic lens. The functional layer preferably comprises a light polarizing layer or a photochromic layer. The ophthalmic element may be an injection molded, polymeric ophthalmic lens with no ophthalmic prescription power.</p>
    <p>An article of the present invention is generally indicated at <b>8</b> in FIG. <b>1</b>. The article <b>8</b>, which may take the form of an optical element such as an optical lens <b>10</b>, includes a primary part, such as a power portion <b>12</b> and a secondary part, such as a functional portion <b>14</b>. The functional portion <b>14</b> and the power portion <b>12</b> are attached together. The functional portion <b>14</b> and the power portion <b>12</b> are preferably integrally connected to each other and, more preferably, are fused together.</p>
    <p>No method previously existed for making polarized, prescription-specification, polycarbonate lenses. The present invention solves this difficult challenge. For example, the functional portion <b>14</b> of the present invention provides a convenient and systematic way of combining a polarizing element with a polycarbonate lens, while retaining the ability to machine the polycarbonate lens to prescription specifications. As best depicted in FIG. 3, the functional portion <b>14</b> may include a functional member <b>20</b>, such as a functional coating (not shown) or a functional film <b>21</b>, that is attached to a first sheet <b>22</b>. Optionally, the functional portion <b>14</b> may include a second sheet <b>24</b> such that the functional member <b>20</b> is sandwiched between the first sheet <b>22</b> and the second sheet <b>24</b>.</p>
    <p>Though not depicted in FIG. 3, those skilled in the art will recognize that the functional member <b>20</b> may be structured in a variety of ways, such as in composite or multi-layer fashion, in addition to the functional film <b>21</b>. For example, the functional member <b>20</b> could be structured to include film portions (not shown) that entrap and protect an operative substance, such as inorganic photochromic crystals. As another example, the functional member <b>20</b> could include multiple functional film portions (not shown) that are laminated together using a conventional technique.</p>
    <p>A functional element, such as a polarizing element (not shown), may be incorporated into the functional member <b>20</b>, such as the functional film <b>21</b>. The functional portion <b>14</b> that includes the polarizing element may then be included in a mold, such as an injection mold, so that the film <b>21</b> with the polarizing element is integrally molded as part of the lens <b>10</b>. Alternatively, a different functional element, such as a photochromic, abrasion resistant, or tinting element, may be incorporated into the functional member <b>20</b>, such as the film <b>21</b>, and integrally molded as part of the lens <b>10</b>. The functional elements may be made by many convenient manufacturing processes, including but not limited to lamination of the layers, adhesive securement of the individual layers, and extrusion of one or more layers (or all three layers) to form the three layer element (referred to as a laminate, but available for manufacture, as noted above, by processes in addition to lamination). A preferred method of making the functional element is to extrude layers in sequence or at the same time in the appropriate order of layers. The center layer of the three layers should be the layer with the functional capability so that a layer furthest from the ophthalmic element acts as a scratch resistant or protective layer, and the layer closest to the ophthalmic element acts as a cushion or tying layer to the ophthalmic element. It is structurally possible to use a two layer laminate (with the topmost protective resin layer and the ophthalmic element) by using a dry film adhesive or liquid adhesive between the ophthalmic element and the functional layer, but this is a much less preferred method of manufacture.</p>
    <p>The functional portion <b>14</b> may incorporate one or more functional properties. Essentially, the functional portion <b>14</b> operates to put incorporated functional properties in working relation with the power portion <b>12</b>. Examples of some functional properties of interest include filtering features, such as light polarization and photochromism. Additional examples of functional properties of interest include cosmetic properties, such as lens decor, indicia, tint and color. Still further examples of functional properties include durability features, such as hardness, abrasion resistance, and chemical resistance. Preferably, the functional portion <b>14</b> includes a light polarizing component or a photochromic component that functions as a filtering portion of the lens <b>10</b>. Alternatively, or in addition, portions of the functional portion <b>14</b> may be tinted to function as a cosmetic portion of the lens <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>The power portion <b>12</b> of the lens <b>10</b> maybe contoured during initial formation to have an optical magnification characteristic that modifies the focal power of the lens <b>10</b>. Alternatively, the power portion <b>12</b> may be machined after initial formation to modify the focal power of the lens <b>10</b>. The power portion <b>12</b> provides a substantial amount of the optical power and magnification characteristics to the lens <b>10</b>. The functional portion <b>14</b> inherently affects the optical power and magnification characteristics of the lens <b>10</b> since the functional portion <b>14</b> contributes to the overall thickness of the lens <b>10</b>. Preferably, however, the power portion <b>12</b> provides the majority of the lens <b>10</b> optical power and magnification characteristics. Apportioning the majority of optical power and magnification to the power portion <b>12</b> permits selection of power portion <b>12</b> material and power portion <b>12</b> formation techniques that are optimum for superior lens <b>10</b> optical power and magnification characteristics, without adversely affecting selection of optimum functional portion <b>14</b> materials and formation techniques.</p>
    <p>The power portion <b>12</b> of the lens <b>10</b> has both a rear surface <b>16</b> and a front surface <b>18</b>. The functional portion <b>14</b> of the lens <b>10</b> may be coextensive with the front surface <b>18</b> of the power portion <b>12</b>, as in FIG. <b>1</b>. Alternatively, the functional portion <b>14</b> may overlap only a portion of the front surface <b>18</b> of the power portion <b>12</b>, as in FIG. <b>2</b>. Although FIGS. 1, <b>2</b>, and <b>4</b> indicate definite lines of demarcation between the power portion <b>12</b> and the functional portion <b>14</b>, such definite lines do not necessarily exist when the power portion <b>12</b> and the functional portion <b>14</b> are integrally connected. Rather, because of intermolecular bonding, the demarcation line between the power portion <b>12</b> and the functional portion <b>14</b> maybe somewhat blurred when the power portion <b>12</b> and the functional portion <b>14</b> are integrally connected.</p>
    <p>The functional portion <b>14</b> may take the form of a plate <b>17</b>, as in FIG. 3, that is separated from a functional laminate <b>19</b>. The functional laminate <b>19</b> includes the functional member <b>20</b>, such as the functional film <b>21</b>. The functional film <b>21</b> may include a base film (not shown) and a functional medium (not shown) that is incorporated into or onto the base film. When the functional member <b>20</b> is other than the functional film <b>21</b>, the functional member <b>20</b> may include more than one base film (not shown). Alternatively, the functional film <b>21</b> may include the functional medium (not shown) and a base resin (not shown), with the functional medium and the base resin being homogeneously blended together prior to formation of functional film <b>21</b> from the medium/resin mixture. Besides the functional member <b>20</b>, the functional laminate <b>19</b> includes the first sheet <b>22</b> and, optionally, includes the second sheet <b>24</b>. If the second sheet <b>24</b> is included, the first and second sheets <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are located on opposing sides of the functional member <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p>The first sheet <b>22</b> may be attached to the functional member <b>20</b>, such as the functional film <b>21</b>, by first adhesive <b>26</b>, and the second sheet <b>24</b>, if included, may be attached to the functional member <b>20</b> by second adhesive <b>28</b>. The first adhesive is typically not included when the functional member <b>20</b> is the functional coating (not shown). A first coating <b>30</b> may optionally be applied onto the first sheet <b>22</b> and a second coating <b>32</b> may optionally be applied onto the second sheet <b>24</b>, if the second sheet <b>24</b> is included. The second sheet <b>24</b> and the first and second coatings <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> are depicted with dashed lines to illustrate the optional nature of the second sheet <b>24</b> and the coatings <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, the functional portion <b>14</b> may consist of a functional wafer (not shown) that includes the first sheet <b>22</b>. In the functional wafer, the functional member <b>20</b>, and thus the functional film <b>21</b>, may consist of either the second sheet <b>24</b>, the second coating <b>32</b>, or the second sheet <b>24</b> that is coated with the second coating <b>32</b>. If the functional wafer includes the second sheet <b>24</b>, the functional wafer may optionally also include either the first adhesive <b>26</b> or the second adhesive <b>28</b> to attach the second sheet <b>24</b> to the first sheet <b>22</b>. Also, the first sheet <b>22</b> may optionally include the first coating <b>30</b>.</p>
    <p>The functional portion <b>14</b> may be attached to the power portion <b>12</b> with either the first sheet <b>22</b>, the second sheet <b>24</b>, the first coating <b>30</b>, or the second coating <b>32</b> in contact with the power portion <b>12</b>. Preferably, the functional portion <b>14</b> is attached to the power portion <b>12</b> with either the first sheet <b>22</b> or the second sheet <b>24</b> in contact (not shown) with the power portion <b>12</b>, since the first and second coatings <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> tend to degrade adhesion of the functional portion <b>14</b> to the power portion <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p>When the first sheet <b>22</b> or the first coating <b>30</b> is in contact with the power portion <b>12</b>, the second sheet <b>24</b>, if included, may form an outside surface <b>34</b> of the lens <b>10</b> that is open to atmosphere and that protects the functional member <b>20</b> from marring and abrasion. The second coating <b>32</b>, if included, may substitute for the second sheet <b>24</b> as the outside surface <b>34</b>. Alternatively, when the second sheet <b>24</b> or the second coating <b>32</b> is in contact with the power portion <b>12</b>, the second sheet <b>24</b>, if included, may form the outside surface <b>34</b> of the lens <b>10</b> that is open to atmosphere and that protects the functional member <b>20</b> from marring and abrasion. Also, the first coating <b>30</b>, if included, may substitute for the first sheet <b>22</b> as the outside surface <b>34</b>. Furthermore, when the functional portion <b>14</b> takes the form of the functional wafer (not shown), the second sheet <b>24</b> or the second coating <b>32</b> may form the protective outside surface <b>34</b>.</p>
    <p>The lens <b>10</b> may alternatively be characterized as having a front section (not shown), a functional section (not shown), and a rear section (not shown). In this characterization, the front section and the rear section are located on opposite sides of the functional section. Additionally, the functional member <b>20</b> may serve as the functional section and the power portion <b>12</b> may serve as the rear section. Additionally, either the first sheet <b>22</b> or the second sheet <b>24</b>, if included, may serve as the front section.</p>
    <p>The functional member <b>20</b>, as indicated, preferably includes either the light polarizing property or the photochromic property. When the functional member <b>20</b> includes the light polarizing property, the base film or resin is preferably of the polyvinyl alcohol-type, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,051,309 to Kawaki, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Specific examples of suitable resins of either the base film or the base resin include polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl formal, polyvinyl acetal, and saponified (ethylene/vinyl acetate) copolymer film, with polyvinyl alcohol being especially preferred.</p>
    <p>When the functional member <b>20</b> includes the photochromic property, the base film or base resin may include homo and copolymers of various materials, such as cellulose acetate butyrate, poly(n-butyl methacrylate), poly(isobutyl methacrylate), poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(ethyl methacrylate), polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(acrylonitrile), poly(vinyl acetate), poly(vinyl chloride), poly(butadiene), and polyamide, that are formed from appropriate monomers and pre-polymers using conventional polymerization technology. Cellulose acetate butyrate is the preferred material for the base film or base resin since cellulose acetate butyrate readily incorporates photochromic dyes and since photochromic dyes activate and perform well in cellulose acetate butyrate.</p>
    <p>Examples of suitable dichroic substances, such as dichroic dyes, for imparting the light polarizing property to the base film or resin are listed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,051,309 to Kawaki et al. Some examples of suitable dichroic substances include Chlorantine Fast Red (C.I. 28160), Chrysophenine (C.I. 24895), Sirius Yellow (C.I. 29000), Benzopurpurine (C.I. 23500), Direct Fast Red (C.I. 23630), Brilliant Blue 6B (C.I. 24410), Chlorazol Black BH (C.I. 22590), Direct Blue 2B (C.I. 22610), Direct Sky Blue (C.I. 24400), Diamine Green (C.I. 30295), Congo Red (C.I. 22120), and Acid Black (C.I. 20470). It is to be understood that the dichroic substance incorporated in the base film or resin may be either a single dichroic substance or a mixture that includes two or more of the dichroic substances.</p>
    <p>The functional member <b>20</b> may incorporate any organic or inorganic photochromic substance or compound, such as photochromic substances or compounds that are compatible with the base film or resin and that are capable of imparting photochromic properties to the base film or resin. Also, the photochromic substances or compounds incorporated in the functional member <b>20</b> may be a mixture that includes two or more different dichroic substances or compounds. Examples of organic photochromic compounds suitable for imparting photochromic properties to the functional member <b>20</b>, such as the base film or resin, include naphthopyrans, spironaphthopyrans, fulgides, fulgimides, salicylates, triazoles, oxazoles, and azobenzenes. Silver halide is one example of an inorganic photochromic compound that is suitable for imparting photochromic properties to the functional member <b>20</b>, such as the base film or resin.</p>
    <p>The functional portion <b>14</b> substantially prevents the structure of the dichroic substance(s) or the photochromic compound(s) from being altered due to placement of the dichroic substance(s) or the photochromic compound(s) in working relation with the power portion <b>12</b>. Preferably, the functional portion <b>14</b> prevents alteration of the structure of dichroic substance(s) and photochromic compound(s) due to placement of the dichroic substance(s) or the photochromic compound(s) in working relation with the power portion <b>12</b>. Additionally, the functional portion <b>14</b> substantially prevents the light polarizing activity of the dichroic substance(s) and the photochromic activity of the photochromic compound(s) from being altered due to placement of the dichroic substance(s) or the photochromic compound(s) in working relation with the power portion <b>12</b>. Preferably, the functional portion <b>14</b> prevents alteration of the light polarizing activity of the dichroic substance(s) and prevents any significant alteration of the photochromic activity of the photochromic compound(s) due to placement of the dichroic substance(s) or the photochromic compound(s) in working relation with the power portion <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p>Examples of naphthopyran compounds suitable for imparting photochromic properties to the functional member <b>20</b>, such as the base film or resin, include novel naphthopyran compounds that may be represented by graphic formula I as follows: <chemistry> <div class="patent-image small-patent-image"> <a href="//patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/US6328446B1/US06328446-20011211-C00001.png"> <img id="EMI-C00001" file="US06328446-20011211-C00001.TIF" img-content="chem" img-format="tif" src="//patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/US6328446B1/US06328446-20011211-C00001.png" class="patent-full-image" alt="Figure US06328446-20011211-C00001"> </a> </div> <attachments> <attachment idref="CHEMCDX-00001" attachment-type="cdx" file="US06328446-20011211-C00001.CDX"> </attachment> <attachment idref="CHEMMOL-00001" attachment-type="mol" file="US06328446-20011211-C00001.MOL"> </attachment> </attachments> </chemistry> </p>

    <p>For purposes of the present application, including the description and the claims, it is to be understood that graphical formula II includes all structural isomers of the compounds represented by graphical formula II.</p>
    <p>A variety of substituents may be placed on the pyran and the naphtho portion of the spironaphthopyrans of the present invention. For example, the positions represented in graphic formula II by R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>5</sub>, R<sub>6</sub>, R<sub>7</sub>, R<sub>8</sub>, R<sub>9</sub>, and R<sub>10</sub>, respectively, may be filled with hydrogen; a stable organic radical, such as alkyl, alkoxy, phenyl, naphthyl, cycloalkyl, furyl, alkoyl, alkoyloxy, aroyl, aroyloxy; a heterocyclic group; a halogen; a nitrogen-substituted group, such as amino or nitro; or a nitrogen-substituted ring compound, such as morpholino, piperidino, or piperazino.</p>

    <p>Preferred spironaphthopyran compounds for imparting photochromic properties to the functional member <b>20</b>, such as the base film or resin, include 8-methoxyspiro(3H-naphtho[2,1-b]pyran-3,9′-fluorene), spiro(3H-naphtho[2,1-b]pyran-3,9′-fluorene), 8-methoxyspiro(3H-naphtho[2,1-b]pyran-3,1′-tetralone), 6′,7′-dimethoxy-8-methoxyspiro(3H-naphtho[2,1-b]pyran-3,1′-tetralone), 7′-methoxy-8-methoxyspiro(3H-naphtho[2,1-b]pyran-3,1′-tetralone), 2′,3′-diphenyl-8-methoxyspiro(3H-naphtho[2,1-b]pyran-3,1′-tetralone), 2′-methyl-8-methoxyspiro(3H-naphtho[2,1-b]pyran-3,1′-tetralone), 2′-methyl-8-methoxyspiro(3H-naphtho[2,1-b]pyran-3,1′-indan), 2′,3′-diphenyl-8-methoxyspiro(3H-naphtho[2,1-b]pyran-3,1′-indene), 2′,3′-diphenyl-8-methoxyspiro(3H-naphtho[2,1-b]pyran-3,1′-tetralone), 2′-methyl-8-methoxyspiro(3H-naphtho[2,1-b]pyran-3,1′-tetralone), 2′-methyl-8-methoxyspiro(3H-naphtho[2,1-b]pyran-3,1′-indan), and 2′,3′-diphenyl-8-methoxyspiro(3H-naphtho[2,1-b]pyran-3,1′-indene).</p>
    <p>Additional details about preparation and use of the novel naphthopyran compounds represented by graphic formula II, including the preferred naphthopyran compounds, may be obtained from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/331,281 entitled “Photochromic Spironaphthopyran Compounds” and filed on Oct. 28, 1994 in the name of Frank J. Hughes et al. as Applicants, which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
    <p>The first sheet <b>22</b> and the second sheet <b>24</b> should be compatible with the power portion <b>12</b>, the functional member <b>20</b>, the first and second adhesives <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, and, if included, the first and second coatings <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. In this context, compatibility means that the first sheet <b>22</b> or the second sheet <b>24</b>, as appropriate, is capable of either strongly adhering to or strongly fusing with the material of the power portion <b>12</b>. Additionally, compatibility means that the material of the first sheet <b>22</b> and of the second sheet <b>24</b> is incapable of undesirably reacting with other lens <b>10</b> components to degrade the power portion <b>12</b>, the functional member <b>20</b>, the first adhesive <b>22</b>, the second adhesive <b>24</b>, the first coating <b>30</b> (if included), the second coating <b>32</b> (if included), or functional media, such as photochromic or polarizing compounds incorporated in the functional member <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the power portion <b>12</b> and the one of the first sheet <b>22</b> and the second sheet <b>24</b> that is attached to the power portion <b>12</b> may generally be made of any resinous material. Thus, the first sheet <b>22</b> and the second sheet <b>24</b> may each be made of different materials, such as different thermoplastic resins. Additionally, either or both of the sheets <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may be made of a different material than the power portion <b>12</b> is made of. Preferably, the power portion <b>12</b> and the one of the first sheet <b>22</b> and the second sheet <b>24</b> that is attached to the power portion <b>12</b> are each made of any of a variety thermoplastic resins, including homopolymers and copolymers of polycarbonate, amorphous polyolefin, polystyrene, and acrylic compounds, so long as the aforementioned material compatibility requirement is met, to permit fusion of the power portion <b>12</b> to the first sheet <b>22</b> or second sheet <b>24</b>. More preferably, the power portion <b>12</b> and the one of the first sheet <b>22</b> and the second sheet <b>24</b> that is attached to the power portion <b>12</b> are each made of the same thermoplastic resin to further enhance fusion of the power portion <b>12</b> to the first sheet <b>22</b> or second sheet <b>24</b>.</p>
    <p>Materials suitable for use as the first adhesive <b>26</b> and the second adhesive <b>28</b> must have good optical properties, including high optical transparencies, no yellowing upon exposure to sunlight, an ability to flex during injection molding without becoming crazed, minimal shrinkage during curing, and must meet the aforementioned material compatibility requirement. Some examples of suitable materials for the first adhesive <b>26</b> and the second adhesive <b>28</b> include acrylic-type, epoxy-type and urethane-type adhesives, such as Loctite® FMD-207, Loctite® FMD-338, Loctite® FMD-436, and Loctite® 3311, each available from Loctite Corporation of Hartford, Conn.; Norland Optical Adhesive Type 68 available from Norland Products. Inc. of New Brunswick, N.J.; and Summers Laboratories Type SK-9 available from Summers Laboratories, Inc. of Collegeville, Pa. The materials used for the first adhesive <b>26</b> and the second adhesive <b>28</b> may be curable by thermal treatment or by treatment with ultraviolet light.</p>
    <p>The first coating <b>30</b> and the second coating <b>32</b> may be formed of any material(s) suitable for providing hardness, abrasion resistance, and/or chemical resistance to the functional portion <b>14</b>, so long as the aforementioned material compatibility requirement is met. Some examples of suitable coating materials include hard acrylic coatings and hard polysiloxane compounds. Preferably, the one of the sheets <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> that is in contact with the power portion <b>12</b> does not include the respective coating <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, since it has been found that coating of the one of the sheets <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> that is in contact with the power portion <b>12</b> tends to decrease bonding of the functional portion <b>14</b> to the power portion <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p>One benefit of the lens <b>10</b> of the present invention is that an overall center thickness A of the lens <b>10</b>, referring to FIG. 1, measured along longitudinal axis Z of the lens <b>10</b> may be minimized to decrease the weight of the lens <b>10</b>. For example, in accordance with the present invention, a center thickness B of the power portion <b>12</b> preferably ranges from about 0.9 mm to about 20.0 mm and more preferably ranges from about 1.0 mm to about 9.0 mm. Similarly, though a center thickness C of the functional portion <b>14</b> may be any thickness that is adequate to obtain the desired functional effect, such as the light polarizing effect or the photochromic effect, in the lens <b>10</b>, the center thickness C of the functional portion <b>14</b> preferably ranges from about 0.2 mm to about 2 mm and more preferably ranges from about 0.3 mm to about 0.7 mm. Though the center thicknesses B and C of the power portion <b>12</b> and the functional portion <b>14</b> are depicted in FIG. 1 as being offset from the axis Z of the lens, it is to be understood that the center thicknesses B and C of the power portion <b>12</b> and the functional portion <b>14</b>, respectively, are each measured along the axis Z. Finally, the center thickness A of the lens <b>10</b> preferably ranges from about 1.5 mm to about 22.0 mm and more preferably ranges from about 1.6 mm to about 10.0 mm.</p>
    <p>The preferred and more preferred ranges of thickness of the functional film <b>21</b>, the first and second sheets <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, the first and second adhesives <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, and the first and second coatings <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, if included, are presented in Table 1 below:</p>

    <p>As noted, when the functional portion <b>14</b> takes the form of the functional wafer (not shown), the functional film <b>21</b> may consist of either the second sheet <b>24</b>, the second coating <b>32</b>, or the second sheet <b>24</b> that is coated with the second coating <b>32</b>. Thus, when the functional portion <b>14</b> takes the form of the functional wafer (not shown), it should be readily understood that consequent changes in the thickness of the functional film <b>21</b> will result.</p>
    <p>The lens <b>10</b> may be either a single vision lens, a progressive multi-focal lens, an aspheric lens, an aspheric multi-focal lens, or a stepped multi-focal lens. Single vision lenses, which may take the form of the lens <b>10</b>, have essentially the same focal power at any point on the outside surface <b>34</b> of the lens <b>10</b> when objects (not shown) located in front of the functional portion <b>14</b> of the lens <b>10</b> are viewed through the lens <b>10</b> from a select point X located behind the lens <b>10</b> and on the axis Z. The outside surface <b>34</b> should be substantially smooth, and is preferably very smooth, to help minimize generation of any irregular, unpredictable optical effects in the lens <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>For the progressive multi-focal lens, which may also take the form of the lens <b>10</b>, the focal power of the lens <b>10</b> changes in continuous increments when objects located in front of the outside surface <b>34</b> are viewed from the select point X through different points of the outside surface <b>34</b>. For the progressive multi-focal lens, the focal power of the lens <b>10</b>, when viewing objects from point X, changes in continuous increments when moving about the outside surface <b>34</b>, in part due to the smooth continuous nature of the outside surface <b>34</b> of the lens <b>10</b> that is progressive multi-focal. When the lens <b>10</b> is progressive multi-focal, the front surface <b>18</b> and the outside surface <b>34</b> are aspherically shaped. Additionally, when objects are viewed from point X through the lens <b>10</b> that is progressive multi-focal, lines are not seen when moving between points about the surface <b>34</b> that have different focal powers.</p>
    <p>When the lens <b>10</b> is a stepped multi-focal lens, such as the lens <b>10</b> depicted in FIG. 4, the front surface <b>18</b> of the power portion <b>12</b> is discontinuous. For example, the lens <b>10</b> of FIG. 4 is a stepped bi-focal lens in which the front surface <b>18</b> is divided into a main focal surface <b>36</b> and a secondary focal surface <b>38</b>. The main focal surface <b>36</b> and the secondary focal surface <b>38</b> cooperate to define a stepped surface <b>40</b> that disrupts smooth transition between the main focal surface <b>36</b> and the secondary focal surface <b>38</b>. As depicted in FIG. 4, the secondary focal surface <b>38</b> may be elevated, at least in part, relative to the main focal surface <b>36</b>. Alternatively, though not depicted in FIG. 4, it is to be understood that the main focal surface <b>36</b> may be elevated, at least in part, relative to the secondary focal surface <b>38</b>. Furthermore, it is to be understood that when the lens <b>10</b> is stepped multi-focal, the front surface <b>18</b> may be divided into more than two discontinuous surfaces, rather than only the two discontinuous surfaces, namely the main focal surface <b>36</b> and the secondary focal surface <b>38</b>, as depicted in FIG. <b>4</b>.</p>
    <p>When the lens <b>10</b> is multi-focal, the lens <b>10</b> may be either progressive multi-focal, aspheric multi-focal, or stepped multi-focal. The costs of obtaining the progressive and the aspheric multi-focal lenses are somewhat comparable to the cost of obtaining the stepped multi-focal lenses. Manufacture of stepped multi-focal lenses requires somewhat less expensive and somewhat less complicated tooling than does manufacture of progressive multi-focal lenses or manufacture of aspheric multi-focal lenses. On the other hand, actual manufacturing costs for stepped multi-focal lenses are somewhat higher that are manufacturing costs for progressive or aspheric multi-focal lenses.</p>
    <p>Nonetheless, the lens <b>10</b> is preferably progressive multi-focal, rather than stepped multi-focal, since shaping of the functional portion <b>14</b> to match the shape of the front surface <b>18</b> of the power portion <b>12</b> is easier for the progressive multi-focal lens than for the stepped multi-focal lens. Furthermore, progressive multi-focal lenses are generally perceived by consumers to be a more sophisticated and cosmetically appealing lens than stepped multi-focal lenses. Additionally, the lens <b>10</b> is preferably progressive multi-focal, rather than aspheric multi-focal, since progressive multi-focal lenses are generally perceived by consumers to be a more sophisticated and cosmetically appealing lens than aspheric multi-focal lenses.</p>
    <p>The lens <b>10</b>, as in FIGS. 1, <b>2</b>, and <b>4</b>, may be either a finished lens or a semi-finished lens. When the lens <b>10</b> is the finished lens, the focal power or focal power range of the lens is set during manufacture of the lens <b>10</b> and no further processing of the lens <b>10</b> is required to set the focal power or focal power range. When the lens <b>10</b> is semi-finished, additional processing after initial manufacture of the lens <b>10</b>, such as grinding of a rear surface <b>42</b> of the lens <b>10</b>, is needed to set the focal power or focal power range of the lens <b>10</b>. If the lens <b>10</b> is finished, the rear surface <b>42</b> may include a coating (not shown) to enhance the hardness and abrasion resistance of the rear surface <b>42</b> of the lens. If the lens <b>10</b> is semi-finished, the coating need only be applied to the outside surface <b>34</b> of the lens <b>10</b>, since the coating on the rear surface <b>42</b> of the lens <b>10</b> may be damaged or removed during further processing of the semi-finished lens. However, even if the lens <b>10</b> is semi-finished, the rear surface <b>42</b> may include the coating (not shown) to simplify or reduce the cost of manufacturing the semi-finished lens.</p>
    <p>The method of making the lens <b>10</b> generally involves three distinct steps. First, the functional member <b>20</b>, such as the functional coating (not shown) or the functional film <b>21</b>, is prepared. Next, the functional portion <b>14</b> is prepared. Finally, the lens <b>10</b> is made by attaching the functional portion <b>14</b> to the power portion <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p>It is to be understood that functional properties in addition to polarization or photochromism, such as tint, color, hardness, abrasion resistance, and chemical resistance, decor, and indicia may be incorporated in the functional member <b>20</b>, such as functional coating (not shown) or the functional film <b>21</b>, using conventional techniques. However, the functional film <b>21</b> preferably incorporates either the light polarization property or the photochromic property. Additionally, any of the sheets <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> or the coatings <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> may impart durability characteristics, such as hardness, abrasion resistance, and chemical resistance, to the lens <b>10</b> and especially to the outside surface <b>34</b> of the lens.</p>
    <p>The dichroic compound(s) may be incorporated into the base film to make the functional film <b>21</b> with the polarizing property using any suitable procedure. For example, the base film (not shown) may be immersed in an aqueous solution of dichroic substance at a temperature ranging from about 10° C. to about 50° C. to effect absorption of the dichroic substance on the base film. Next, the base film is stretched in one direction to a dimension ranging about 2½ times to about 8 times the unstretched dimension of the base film in a water solution with a temperature ranging from about 10° C. to about 80° C. The water solution should contain a dissolved additive, such as a metal ion or boric acid, to effect adsorption and orientation of the dichroic substance(s) onto the base film.</p>
    <p>The organic photochromic compound(s) may be incorporated into the base film to make the functional film <b>21</b> having the photochromic property using any suitable procedure. As an example, in one suitable procedure useful for the preferred naphthopyrans and spironaphthopyrans the photochromic compound(s) are dissolved in a suitable solvent. Examples of suitable solvents include butyl acetate; hexane; cyclohexane; various alcohols, including ethanol and methanol; and various ketones; such as cyclohexanone and methyl ethyl ketone. Next, a photochromic compound/resin/solvent mixture is made by adding the photochromic compound/solvent solution to the molten monomer or molten pre-polymer of the homopolymer or copolymer selected for the base film. A suitable ultraviolet stabilizing compound may be incorporated into the photochromic compound/resin/solvent mixture to help stabilize the photochromic compound(s) against activation fatigue.</p>
    <p>In a second suitable alternative for the preferred naphthopyrans and spironaphthopyrans, the photochromic compound(s) and the homopolymer or copolymer resin selected for the base film are first mixed together. The solvent is then added to the photochromic compound/resin mixture, and the photochromic compound/resin/solvent mixture is heated to melt and/or dissolve the photochromic compound(s) and resin in the solvent and homogeneously mix all components of the mixture.</p>
    <p>The mixture of photochromic compound(s), solvent, and monomer or pre-polymer, however created, may be formed into a film or sheet by a suitable extrusion or casting method. Preferably, the mixture is cast on a flat surface using a conventional thermoset plastic casting technique. Upon evaporation of the solvent from the cast film or sheet, the functional film <b>21</b> having the photochromic property remains.</p>
    <p>The inorganic photochromic compound(s) may be incorporated into the functional member <b>20</b>, such as the functional film <b>21</b>, having the photochromic property using any suitable procedure. As an example, the inorganic photochromic compound(s) may be any suitable potentially photochromic glass that is treated and ground to make photochromic glass particles in accordance with U.S. Pat. No. 4,622,184 to Barnhart et. al, which is hereby incorporated by reference. The photochromic glass particles may be blended with the base resin, as specified in U.S. Pat. No. 4,622,184, and then may be formed into the functional film <b>21</b> a conventional method, such as a suitable extrusion or casting method.</p>
    <p>As another example, the inorganic photochromic compound(s), such as silver halide particles, may be co-deposited along with a monomer on a substrate, such as the base film, in accordance with U.S. Pat. No. 4,596,673 to Beale, which is hereby incorporated by reference. The monomer polymerizes as a result of the co-deposition to secure the silver halide to the base film. Monomers that are suitable for use in practicing the method of U.S. Pat. No. 4,596,673 include hexamethyldisiloxane, hexamethyldisilizane, vinyl trimethylsiloxane, tetramethyldisiloxane, and vinyl trimethoxysilane. The functional film <b>21</b> that incorporates the inorganic photochromic compound(s), such as the silver halide particles, remains after the monomer polymerizes.</p>
    <p>As an additional example, the base resin may be prepared by combining (1) an unsaturated polyester resin produced by esterification of a polybasic unsaturated organic acid with a polyhydric alcohol and (2) a polar vinyl monomer of the type that forms polar solvent soluble plastic when homopolymerized, in accordance with U.S. Pat. No. 4,110,244 to Hovey, which is hereby incorporated by reference. One or more unsaturated vinyl monomers may, if desired, be blended with the unsaturated polyester resin before the polyester resin is combined with the polar vinyl monomer. The mixture of the unsaturated polyester resin, either with or without the unsaturated vinyl monomer(s), and the polar vinyl monomer may be polymerized and cast in accordance with U.S. Pat. No. 4,110,244 to form the base film. The base film is then immersed in ionic solutions in accordance with U.S. Pat. No. 4,110,244 to form the functional film <b>21</b> that incorporates the inorganic photochromic compound(s), such as silver halide.</p>
    <p>As another example, the inorganic photochromic compound(s), such as silver halide crystals, may be coated with an inorganic material to make coated photochromic material, in accordance with U.S. Pat. No. 4,046,586 to Uhlmann et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference. The coated photochromic material may then be blended, as indicated in the Uhlmann patent, with a solution of the base resin in a suitable solvent. The functional film <b>21</b> may then be prepared by casting the mixture of the base resin, the solvent, and the coated photochromic material, using a conventional casting technique.</p>
    <p>As yet another example, the inorganic photochromic compound(s), such as silver halide crystals, may be incorporated into a photochromic plastic material, as explained in U.S. Pat. No. 4,049,567 to Chu et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference. The photochromic plastic material may then be sandwiched between two sheets of the base film and sealed with epoxy resin, in accordance with the Chu patent, to form the functional member <b>20</b>. This is an example of how the functional member <b>20</b> may be structured other than as the functional film <b>21</b>.</p>
    <p>After the functional member <b>20</b>, such as the functional film <b>21</b>, is prepared, the functional portion <b>14</b> may be made by laminating the first sheet <b>22</b> and, if desired, the second sheet <b>24</b> to the functional member <b>20</b> using the first adhesive <b>26</b> and the second adhesive <b>28</b>, respectively. Any conventional adhesive-based lamination technique, such as rolling to apply suitable pressure, may be relied upon to laminate the sheets <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, to the functional member <b>20</b>. The coating <b>30</b>, if included, may be applied to the first sheet <b>22</b> either before or after lamination of the sheet <b>22</b> to the functional member <b>20</b>. Similarly, if the second sheet <b>24</b> is included, the coating <b>32</b>, if included, may be applied to the second sheet <b>24</b> either before or after lamination of the sheet <b>24</b> to the functional member <b>20</b>. Alternatively, when the functional member <b>20</b> is the functional coating (not shown), the functional portion <b>14</b> may be prepared by applying the functional coating onto the first sheet <b>22</b> using any suitable procedure, such as spraying, brushing, or powder application. Examples of materials that are suitable for forming the functional coating include those materials that are suitable for providing functional properties, such as hardness, abrasion resistance, and/or chemical resistance, to the functional portion <b>14</b>, so long as the aforementioned material compatibility requirement is met. Some examples of suitable materials for the functional coating include hard acrylic coatings and hard polysiloxane compounds.</p>
    <p>When the functional coating (not shown) is included, the first adhesive <b>26</b> is optional since the functional coating may be applied directly onto the first sheet <b>22</b>. typically provides the outside surface <b>34</b> of the lens <b>10</b>. Also, the second adhesive <b>28</b>, the second sheet <b>24</b>, and the second coating <b>32</b> are optional when the functional member <b>20</b> is the functional coating since the functional coating may be used to form the outside surface <b>34</b> of the lens <b>10</b>. Furthermore, the functional coating may be selected to provide the outside surface <b>34</b> with desirable functional properties, such as hardness, abrasion resistance, and/or chemical resistance.</p>
    <p>In one preferred embodiment, the functional film <b>21</b> that incorporates the polarizing property is a purchased item known as POLA SHEET. POLA SHEET may be obtained by contacting Yushi Seihin Co. in Tokyo, Japan. It is believed that the functional film <b>21</b> having the photochromic property is not available as a purchased item. Therefore, it is necessary to make the functional film <b>21</b> having the photochromic property using the method of the present invention.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, when the functional portion <b>14</b> takes the form of the functional wafer (not shown), the functional portion <b>14</b> may be prepared by laminating the second sheet <b>24</b> to the first sheet <b>22</b> using the first adhesive <b>26</b> or the second adhesive <b>28</b>. Any conventional adhesive-based lamination technique may be relied upon to laminate the sheets <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, together. The coatings <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, if included, may be applied to the first sheet <b>22</b> and the second sheet <b>24</b>, respectively, either before or after lamination of the sheets <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. When the functional wafer (not shown) does not include the second sheet <b>24</b>, the second coating <b>32</b> may be applied to the first sheet <b>22</b> using any conventional coating application technique.</p>
    <p>The power portion <b>12</b> and the functional portion <b>14</b> may be combined to make the lens <b>10</b> using any conventional technique, such as laminate bonding, injection molding, compression molding, or injection-compression molding (sometimes called “coining”). No matter the method used to join the power and functional portions <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, the plate <b>17</b> must be separated from the functional laminate <b>19</b> and configured to the size and pattern the plate <b>17</b> will have when included in the lens <b>10</b>. The plate <b>17</b> may be separated from the laminate <b>19</b> using any conventional technique. Other than in the Examples, all subsequent comments about plate <b>17</b> apply with equal force to the functional wafer. Some examples of potential plate <b>17</b> sizes and shapes are depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2. The plate <b>17</b> may be pre-shaped either before being incorporated into the lens <b>10</b> or, alternatively, the plate <b>17</b> may be shaped while being incorporated into the lens <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>The plate <b>17</b> may be pre-shaped using any suitable laminate shaping process. One example of a suitable process entails heating the plate <b>17</b> to a suitable temperature. Simultaneous with or subsequent to the heating, positive pressure is applied to the plate <b>17</b> using a suitable device to shape the plate <b>17</b> and match the shape of the front surface. <b>18</b> of the power portion <b>12</b>. Once the plate <b>17</b> is appropriately shaped, the plate <b>17</b> is cooled to room temperature and the positive pressure is released.</p>
    <p>In accordance with the method of the present invention, the power and functional portions <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> may be joined to make the lens <b>10</b> using a molding machine <b>100</b>, as in FIG. 5, that includes a plurality of mold surfaces <b>102</b>. When the molding machine <b>100</b> is closed, as in FIG. 6, the mold surfaces <b>102</b> define a plurality of mold cavities <b>104</b>. Though two mold cavities <b>104</b> are depicted in FIG. 6, it is to be understood that the molding machine <b>100</b> may include only one of the mold cavities <b>104</b> and may also include more than two of the cavities <b>104</b>.</p>
    <p>The molding machine <b>100</b> is preferably a reciprocating screw injection molding machine. The molding machine <b>100</b>, referring back to FIG. 5, includes an injection portion <b>106</b> and a clamping portion <b>108</b>. The injection portion <b>106</b> includes a barrel <b>110</b> that contains a reciprocating screw (not shown). The injection portion <b>106</b> also includes a hopper <b>112</b> that directs pelletized thermoplastic resin (not shown) to the screw. The injection portion <b>106</b> further includes a plurality of heater bands <b>114</b> arranged about the barrel <b>110</b> to melt the thermoplastic resin. Additionally, the injection portion <b>106</b> includes a hydraulic power unit <b>116</b> that rotates and reciprocates the screw.</p>
    <p>The clamping portion <b>108</b> includes a mold portion <b>118</b> and a drive portion <b>120</b> that opens and closes the mold portion <b>118</b>. The mold portion <b>118</b> includes a fixed mold half <b>122</b> that is in fixed association with the injection portion <b>106</b>. The mold portion <b>118</b> also includes a movable mold half <b>124</b> that is in mateable association with the fixed mold half <b>122</b>. Together, referring to FIG. 6, the mold halves <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> cooperatively define the mold cavities <b>104</b>. The mold surfaces <b>102</b> of each mold cavity <b>104</b> may be classified into three types of molding surfaces, namely, a convex surface <b>126</b>, a concave surface <b>128</b>, and radial surfaces <b>130</b>. The convex surface <b>126</b> of the mold cavity <b>104</b> defines the outside surface <b>34</b> of the lens <b>10</b>. The convex surface <b>126</b> may be configured to match any shape of the outside surface <b>34</b> of the lens <b>10</b>, including the discontinuous shape, as in FIG. 4, of the outside surface <b>34</b>. Similarly, the concave surface <b>128</b> of the mold cavity <b>104</b> defines the rear surface <b>42</b> of the lens <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>The radial surfaces <b>130</b> of the mold cavity <b>104</b> define a perimeter <b>44</b> of the lens <b>10</b>. The radial surfaces <b>130</b> may be entirely defined in the movable mold half <b>124</b>, as depicted in FIG. <b>5</b>. Alternatively, though not depicted in the Figures, the radial surfaces <b>130</b> may be entirely defined in the fixed mold half <b>122</b> or may be partially defined in the fixed mold half <b>122</b> and partially defined in the movable mold half <b>124</b>.</p>
    <p>The fixed mold half <b>122</b> has a sprue <b>132</b> that is in fluid communication with the injection unit <b>106</b>. Additionally, opposing surfaces <b>134</b> of the fixed mold half <b>122</b> and the movable mold half <b>124</b> cooperatively define branches <b>136</b>, as depict in FIG. 6, which place the injection unit <b>106</b> and the sprue <b>132</b> in fluid communication with each mold cavity <b>104</b>. The mold portion <b>118</b> additionally includes a plurality of cooling lines <b>138</b> oriented within the mold halves <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> to cool molten thermoplastic resin after injection of the resin into the mold cavity <b>104</b> is complete.</p>
    <p>The movable mold half <b>124</b> preferably includes a fixed mold plate <b>146</b> and a movable mold plate <b>148</b>. The mold half <b>124</b> also includes a plurality of sleeves <b>150</b> that are in substantial registry with radial surfaces <b>130</b> of the mold cavities <b>104</b>. The mold half <b>124</b> further includes a plurality of pistons <b>152</b> that are slideably received within the sleeves <b>150</b> and are fixedly attached to the mold plate <b>148</b> at ends <b>154</b>. Ends <b>156</b> of the pistons <b>152</b> form the convex surfaces <b>126</b> of the mold cavities <b>104</b>.</p>
    <p>The drive portion <b>120</b> of the clamping unit <b>108</b> includes a hydraulic ram <b>158</b> that is in working relationship with the movable mold half <b>124</b>. The drive portion <b>120</b> further includes a hydraulic power unit <b>160</b> that drives the hydraulic ram <b>158</b> and places the movable mold portion <b>124</b> either in an open condition <b>162</b>, as in FIG. 5, or in a closed position <b>164</b>, as in FIG. <b>6</b>.</p>
    <p>The movable plate <b>148</b>, and thus the pistons <b>152</b>, are in working relations with the hydraulic ram <b>158</b>. Movement of the plate <b>148</b> and the pistons <b>152</b> is timed so that the pistons <b>152</b> move in the direction of arrow D, as best depicted in FIG. 5, after molding of the lenses <b>10</b> is complete and as the mold halves <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> are separated. Movement of the pistons <b>152</b> in direction D ejects the lenses <b>10</b> from the mold cavities <b>104</b> by substantially even application of pressure over the rear surface <b>42</b> of each lens <b>10</b>. Conversely, movement of the plate <b>148</b> and the pistons <b>152</b> is timed so that the pistons <b>152</b> move in the direction of arrow E to orient the surfaces <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> for molding following ejection of the lenses <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>The clamping unit <b>108</b>, as best depicted in FIG. 6, includes a plurality of tie bars <b>166</b> that help maintain the movable mold half <b>124</b> in mateable alignment with the fixed mold half <b>122</b>. Also, the fixed mold half <b>122</b> includes cylindrical female guides <b>168</b>, and the movable mold half <b>124</b> includes cylindrical male members <b>170</b> that slidably engage respective cylindrical female guides <b>168</b>. The guides <b>168</b> and members <b>170</b> help maintain proper alignment of the fixed and movable mold halves <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> relative to each other.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, the mold halves <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> are made of a low carbon plastic mold steel, such as Series P20 stainless steel tool steel. The molding machine <b>100</b> may be any suitable injection molding machine, such as a Vista injection molding machine which is available from Cincinnati Milacron of Batavia, Ohio.</p>
    <p>Prior to molding the lens <b>10</b> in the molding machine <b>100</b>, the plate <b>17</b> that makes up the functional portion <b>14</b> is placed against a recess <b>172</b> of the mold plate <b>146</b>, as best depicted in FIG. 5, before the mold halves <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> are closed. The recess <b>172</b> may be defined by a notch (not shown) in the convex surface proximate the intersection of the convex surface <b>126</b> and the radial surface <b>130</b>, as best depicted in FIG. <b>6</b>. Alternatively, when any portion of the radial surface <b>130</b> is defined in the fixed mold half <b>122</b>, the recess <b>172</b> may be defined by the intersection of the convex surface <b>126</b> and the radial surface <b>130</b>. When the plate <b>17</b> has a different size or shape than the front surface <b>18</b>, as in FIG. 2, the convex surface <b>126</b>, as in FIG. 5, may be notched (not shown) accordingly to reposition the recess <b>172</b> elsewhere in the convex surface <b>126</b> to accommodate the different size or shape of the front surface <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p>As noted, the plate <b>17</b> may be pre-shaped to match the shape of the front surface <b>18</b> of the power portion <b>12</b>. Alternatively, the molding machine <b>100</b> may be configured with a vacuum source <b>174</b> and associated vacuum lines that are in communication with the convex surface <b>126</b> of each cavity <b>104</b>, as in FIG. <b>5</b>. Using the vacuum source <b>174</b>, each plate <b>17</b> may be placed against respective recesses <b>172</b> and pulled into communication with respective convex surfaces <b>126</b> without pre-shaping the plates <b>17</b> prior to placement in the machine <b>100</b>.</p>
    <p>No matter whether the plates <b>17</b> are pre-shaped outside the mold cavities <b>104</b> or are shaped in the mold cavities <b>104</b>, each plate <b>17</b> should be placed in the respective mold cavity <b>104</b> so that a pneumatic seal (not shown), a mechanical seal (not shown), or a combination pneumatic/mechanical seal (not shown) is created between each plate <b>17</b> and the respective convex surface <b>126</b> of the mold half <b>122</b>. The mechanical seal relates to the plates <b>17</b> that are pre-shaped. To obtain the mechanical seal, the plates <b>17</b> must be properly sized to take into account expansion of the metal used to make the mold halves <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> so that the plates <b>17</b> remain snug and secure within the recesses <b>172</b> when molten resin is injected into the mold cavities <b>104</b>. The pneumatic seal relates to the plates <b>17</b> that are shaped by the vacuum source <b>174</b> and may also relate to the plates <b>17</b> that are pre-shaped. The pneumatic seal may be created by applying sufficient vacuum to maintain the plates <b>17</b> snugly in registry against the respective convex surfaces <b>126</b> while molten resin is injected into the mold cavities <b>104</b>.</p>
    <p>Sealing between plates <b>17</b> and respective convex surfaces <b>126</b> is necessary to prevent molten thermoplastic resin that is injected into the mold cavities <b>104</b> from flowing between the plates <b>17</b> and respective convex surfaces <b>126</b>. Intrusion of the molten resin between the plates <b>17</b> and the convex surfaces <b>126</b> would be expected to undesirably create one or more optical or cosmetic problems, such as delamination of the functional film from the sheet <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, burning of the plate <b>17</b> or the film <b>21</b>, stress points within the plate <b>17</b>, warpage of the plate <b>17</b>, and flow lines on the outside surface <b>34</b> of the lens <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>After placement of the plates <b>17</b> against the recesses <b>172</b>, the molding machine <b>100</b> is closed to form the mold cavities <b>104</b>, as in FIG. <b>6</b>. The thermoplastic resin selected for the power portion <b>12</b> is then injected into the cavities <b>104</b> in the molten state to fill that portion (not shown) of the cavities <b>104</b> not occupied by the plates <b>17</b> and form the power portion <b>12</b> of each lens <b>10</b>. Additionally, in each cavity <b>104</b>, the injected resin comes into abutting contact with the plate <b>17</b> located in the cavity <b>104</b>. The temperature of the injected resin causes the power portion <b>12</b> formed by the injected resin to fuse with the functional portion <b>14</b> at the one of the sheets <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> that is preferably oriented against the front surface <b>18</b> of the power portion <b>12</b>. The heat present in each cavity <b>104</b> is preferably sufficient to cause the power portion <b>12</b> and the functional portion <b>14</b> to fuse together by welding into a permanent bond. After the injected resin solidifies, the cavity <b>104</b> may be opened by moving the molding halves <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> away from each other, as in FIG. <b>5</b>. Preferably, the lens <b>10</b> is then ejected from the molding machine <b>100</b> by movement of the appropriate piston <b>152</b> in direction D.</p>
    <p>Formation of the power portion <b>12</b> in the molding machine <b>100</b> highlights another important advantage of the present invention, namely, the equalizing effect that the power portion <b>12</b> exerts within the lens <b>10</b> upon any non-uniformities in the thickness of the functional portion <b>14</b>. Though it is preferred that the functional portion <b>14</b> be substantially uniform in thickness, some variation in thickness of the functional portion <b>14</b> is permissible. Thickness variation in the functional portion <b>14</b> is permissible because mold cavity <b>104</b> is uniform in thickness. Thus, injection of resin into the mold cavity <b>104</b> compensates for any non-uniformities in thickness of the functional portion <b>14</b> by varying the thickness of the power portion <b>12</b> accordingly.</p>
    <p>After being removed from the machine <b>100</b>, each lens <b>10</b> may be coated with a suitable coating, such as an acrylic or a polysiloxane coating composition, to provide a hard surface on the lens <b>10</b>. Coating may be accomplished using conventional techniques such as dipping, spraying, or spin-coating. As already noted, if lens <b>10</b> is finished after application of the coating, the coating may be applied to the outside surface <b>34</b> and the rear surface <b>42</b> of the lens <b>10</b>. If the lens <b>10</b> is semi-finished, the coating need only be applied to the outside surface <b>34</b> of the lens <b>10</b>, since the coating on the rear surface <b>42</b> may be damaged or removed during further processing of the semi-finished lens. Alternatively, the coating may be applied to all surfaces of the semi-finished lens, including the outside surface <b>34</b> and the rear surface <b>42</b> to simplify or reduce the cost of manufacturing the semi-finished lens.</p>
    <p>A number of advantages are realized when the method of the present invention is used to make the lens <b>10</b>. For example, functional properties are readily incorporated into the lens <b>10</b> without altering the substantially smooth nature, and preferably the very smooth nature, of the outside surface <b>34</b>. Thus, undesirable and unpredictable optical effects that would otherwise be expected to occur in the lens <b>10</b>, if the outside surface <b>34</b> were other than smooth in nature, are greatly minimized or eliminated altogether when the lens <b>10</b> of the present invention is used.</p>
    <p>Also in accordance with the present method, the lens <b>10</b> may be finished, as opposed to semi-finished, with the power portion <b>12</b> being contoured to modify the focal power of the lens <b>10</b>. Alternatively, the lens <b>10</b> may be semi-finished so that the power portion is capable of being machined, at some time following manufacture, to modify the focal power of the lens <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>Additionally, it has been discovered that the functional portion <b>14</b> substantially beneficially prevents the structural alteration of dichroic substances and photochromic compounds due to placement of the dichroic substances or the photochromic compounds in working relation with the power portion <b>12</b>. Furthermore, it has been discovered that the functional portion <b>14</b> substantially prevents the alteration of the light polarizing activity of dichroic substances and alteration of the photochromic activity of photochromic compounds due to placement of the dichroic substances and the photochromic compounds, respectively, in working relation with the power portion <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p>The method of the present invention provides a systematic approach for incorporating a wide variety of functional properties into the lens <b>10</b> simply by modifying the functional portion <b>14</b>. Also, the method of the present invention provides a systematic method for incorporating functional properties into optical elements, such as the lens <b>10</b>, even as new materials supplant presently favored materials, such as polycarbonate, in lens <b>10</b> manufacture. When a new material is developed, the material used to make the first sheet <b>22</b> and the second sheet <b>24</b> may be modified to maintain compatibility between the new material and the materials used in the functional portion <b>14</b>, including the materials of the first and second sheets <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>.</p>
    <p>It should also be understood that the functional portion <b>14</b> may be attached to any surface of a new or existing lens (not shown) using any conventional technique, such as adhesive attachment or laminate bonding. In this way, functional properties may be imparted to new lenses that initially lack the properties. Also, functional properties may be imparted to existing lenses, instead of discarding the existing lenses and manufacturing new lenses that include the functional properties. Additionally, suitable solvents may be applied to remove the functional portion <b>14</b> from the existing lens (not shown) so that a different one of the functional portions may be applied to the existing lens. This option facilitates changing the functional properties of the existing lens when the need for particular functional properties changes.</p>
    <p>The present invention is more particularly described in the following examples which are intended as illustrations only since numerous modifications and variations within the scope of the general formulation will be apparent to those skilled in the art.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLES</heading> <heading>Examples 1-4</heading> <p>Examples 1-4 demonstrates formation of the lens <b>10</b> with the polarizing property incorporated in the functional portion <b>14</b>. Additionally, the lens <b>10</b> formed in Examples 1-4 each have different physical dimensions and different focal powers.</p>
    <p>More particularly, in Examples 1-4, the functional laminate <b>19</b> included the functional film <b>21</b>, the first and second sheets <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, and the first and second adhesives <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>. The functional laminate <b>19</b> also included the second coating <b>32</b>, but did not include the first coating <b>30</b>. The functional laminate <b>19</b> included the light polarizing property and consisted of POLA SHEET obtained from Mitsubishi Engineering Plastics Co. The base film of the functional film <b>21</b> was made of polyvinyl alcohol, and the first and second sheets <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> were made of polycarbonate. The film <b>21</b> was about 0.003 mm thick and the first and second sheets <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> were each about 0.3 mm thick.</p>
    <p>The adhesives <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, which were each about 0.003 mm thick, were ordinary acrylic-type, epoxy-type, or urethane-type adhesives. The coating <b>32</b>, which was about 0.003 mm thick, was a hard polysiloxane coating.</p>
    <p>For each lens <b>10</b> of examples 1-4, the plate <b>17</b> was cut from the functional laminate to make the functional portion <b>14</b>. The plate <b>17</b> was generally round in shape and had substantially the same dimensions as the surface <b>18</b> of the power portion <b>12</b> to be made. The plate <b>17</b>, which was not pre-shaped, was placed within the recesses <b>172</b> so that the second sheet <b>24</b> faced the convex surface <b>126</b>. The plate <b>17</b> was observed to have a snug fit within the recesses <b>172</b> that was suitable for creating the mechanical seal. The vacuum source <b>174</b> was activated to 28.5 millimeters of mercury to effect the pneumatic seal and to pull the plate <b>17</b> into registry with the convex surface <b>126</b>.</p>
    <p>For examples 1-4, the mold halves <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> were then closed to make the mold cavity <b>104</b> using the molding machine <b>100</b>. The clamping force of the machine <b>100</b> used in these examples was 160 tons, and the resin injection velocity was 1.5 inches per second. The resin melt temperature of the machine <b>100</b> was 585° F., and the mold temperature was 265° F. Molten Lexan® polycarbonate resin was injected into the cavity <b>104</b>. Lexan® polycarbonate is available from General Electric Plastics Co. of Pittsfield, Mass. After cooling, the mold halves <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> were opened and the lens <b>10</b> was ejected from the mold half <b>122</b>.</p>
    <p>For the lenses <b>10</b> of Examples 1-4, it was noted that no injected polycarbonate flowed between the plate <b>17</b> and the convex surface <b>126</b>. Additionally, no delamination of the functional portion <b>14</b> and no warping of the functional film <b>21</b> was observed. Furthermore, the functional portion <b>14</b> and the power portion <b>12</b> were found to be firmly attached to each other. No voids or inclusions were found anywhere in the power portion <b>12</b>, including proximate the functional portion <b>14</b>. After the inspection, the second sheet <b>24</b> of each lens <b>10</b> of Examples 1-4 was coated with the coating <b>32</b> using a conventional dip-coating technique.</p>
    <p>Various tests were carried out on the lenses produced in Examples 1-4. The lenses <b>10</b> produced in Examples 1-4, referring to FIG. 1, had diameters F and center thicknesses A as indicated in Table 2 below. Additionally, the design and resultant true curves of the lenses <b>10</b> were determined to have the values listed in Table 2 using conventional optical measurement techniques.</p>

    <p>The resultant true curve of each lens <b>10</b> is the optical curve of the lens <b>10</b> that is measured between opposite sides <b>46</b> of the lens <b>10</b> along the outside surface <b>34</b>, as in FIG. <b>1</b>. The design curve is the tooled curve of the lens <b>10</b>, namely the measured curve of the convex surface <b>126</b> of the mold cavity <b>104</b>, referring to FIG. <b>6</b>. Table 2 illustrates that incorporation of the functional portion <b>14</b> into the lens <b>10</b> in accordance with the present invention causes only essentially no variation between the resultant true curve and the design curve for each of the lenses <b>10</b> produced in Examples 1-4.</p>
    <p>The lenses <b>10</b> made in Examples 1-4 were ground to different finished prescription focal powers and were then found to have good combined power in the spherical and cylindrical axes. Also, the optical properties of the lenses <b>10</b>, including the optical clarity, optical wave, and optical power, were examined using a conventional lensometer apparatus and were found to be excellent.</p>
    <p>The functional portions <b>14</b> of each of the lenses <b>10</b> were also determined to be well adhered to the respective power portions <b>12</b>. Also, the functional portions <b>14</b> of each of the lenses <b>10</b> were tested for delamination and it was observed that the sheets <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> did not delaminate from the functional film <b>21</b>. Additionally, the outside surface <b>34</b> of each lens <b>10</b> was tested for abrasion using the test detailed in ASTM D 3359-78 and found to exhibit superior abrasion resistance.</p>
    <heading>Example 5</heading> <p>This example demonstrates formation of the functional film <b>21</b> from polymeric resin and photochromic dye. In this example, the polymeric resin was cellulose acetate butyrate, and the photochromic dye was 3-(4-biphenylyl)-3-phenyl-8-methoxy-3H-naphtho[2,1b]pyran.</p>
    <p>The first step is to blend the resin and the photochromic dye. To accomplish this, 0.2 grams of the photochromic dye were mixed with 19.8 grams of pelletized cellulose acetate butyrate in a clean, dry, 250 ml glass Erlenmeyer flask. The pelletized cellulose acetate butyrate was Tenite grade 264-E2R300-01, which is available from Eastman Chemical Co. of Kingsport, Tenn. Next, 110.5 grams of n-butyl acetate solvent were added to the dye/resin mixture. The Erlenmeyer flask was then placed in a heating container that held a suitable heat transfer fluid, e.g. ethylene glycol or diethylene glycol. The heat transfer fluid was heated to gradually warm the dye/resin/solvent mixture to 105° C. The dye/resin/solvent mixture was held at 105° C. and stirred, for about four hours, until the dye and resin dissolved in the solvent and the dye/resin/solvent mixture became homogeneously mixed. The resultant dye solution was then cooled to room temperature.</p>
    <p>A 24″×30″×0.375″ piece of float glass was prepared for casting the film <b>21</b> by first leveling the glass and then cleaning the glass with acetone. Next, a mold release agent was prepared by dissolving one drop of n-octyl-trichloro-silane into 10 ml of xylene. The mold release agent was rubbed on the glass using a clean, folded paper tissue that had been dipped in the mold release agent.</p>
    <p>A small puddle of the dye solution, at room temperature, was poured from the Erlenmeyer flask onto the glass. Promptly thereafter, a Gardner Blade, available from the Paul N. Gardner Company of Pompano Beach, Fla., was drawn over the dye solution at a steady rate to spread a uniform sheet of the dye solution across the glass. The n-butyl acetate solvent was allowed to evaporate for about 24 hours at room temperature, leaving the functional film <b>21</b> with the photochromic property on the glass.</p>
    <p>The functional film <b>21</b> was gently removed from the glass by first peeling an edge of the film <b>21</b> off the glass with the help of a razor blade. The film <b>21</b>, after evaporation of the solvent, was determined to be about 0.0013 mm thick.</p>
    <p>The film <b>21</b> was placed in a spectrometer and the total light transmission without activation of the photochromic dye was determined to be about 92% over the range of the visible spectrum. The total light transmission was determined to be about 10% at 480 nm when the photochromic dye was activated using light provided by a 2.25 mw/cm<sup>2 </sup>ultraviolet lamp. The maximum activation wavelength for the photochromic dye, (3-(4-biphenylyl)-3-phenyl-8-methoxy-3H-naphtho[2,1b] pyran) was 480 nm. The ultraviolet lamp was a Bondwand lamp available from Edmund Scientific, Inc. of Barrington, N.J.</p>
    <heading>Example 6</heading> <p>This example demonstrates formation of the functional laminate <b>19</b> using the functional film <b>21</b> produced in Example 5. First, two sheets of 3.5″×3.5″×0.010″ Makrofol® PCEE polycarbonate (color: “nat”; finish: “EE”) was obtained from Bayer, Inc. (formerly Miles, Inc.) of Pittsburgh, Pa. The two polycarbonate sheets, which served as the first sheet <b>22</b> and the second sheet <b>24</b>, each included protective layers on both sides of each sheet <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>.</p>
    <p>The polycarbonate sheet that was to be the first sheet <b>22</b> was placed on a hard, flat surface and the protective layer on the side of the sheet <b>22</b> facing away from the table was removed. Next, the first adhesive <b>26</b>, which initially consisted of a one inch diameter puddle of Loctite® FMD-436 adhesive, was applied by syringe to the side of the sheet <b>22</b> that no longer included the protective layer. The functional film <b>21</b> produced in Example 5 was then carefully placed onto the first adhesive <b>26</b> and the first sheet <b>22</b>. A rolling pin was then used to distribute the first adhesive <b>26</b> at a substantially uniform thickness between the film <b>21</b> and the sheet <b>22</b>.</p>
    <p>Next, the second adhesive <b>28</b>, which initially consisted of a one inch diameter puddle of Loctite® FMD-436 adhesive, was applied by syringe to the side of the film <b>21</b> facing away from the sheet <b>22</b>. The protective layer was then removed from one side of the remaining polycarbonate sheet that was to be the second sheet <b>24</b>. The side of the sheet <b>24</b> not including the protective layer was then placed onto the second adhesive <b>28</b> and the film <b>21</b> to form the functional laminate <b>19</b>. Pressure applied with a rolling pin was then used to distribute the second adhesive <b>28</b> at a substantially uniform thickness between the film <b>21</b> and the sheet <b>24</b>.</p>
    <p>The functional laminate <b>19</b> was then placed under a ZETA® 7400 ultraviolet lamp, available from Loctite Corporation of Hartford, Conn., for three minutes per side to cure the first and second adhesives <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>. The overall thickness of the laminate <b>19</b> was determined to be about 0.59 mm. The laminate <b>19</b> was then placed in a spectrometer and the total light transmission, without activation of the photochromic dye, was determined to be about 92% over the range of the visible spectrum. The total light transmission was determined to be about 10% at 480 nm when the photochromic dye was activated using light provided by the aforementioned Bondwand 2.25 mw/cm<sup>2 </sup>ultraviolet lamp.</p>
    <heading>Example 7</heading> <p>This example demonstrates formation of the functional film <b>21</b> from polymeric resin and a different photochromic dye from that used in Example 5. The same procedures, quantities, process conditions were used in this example as in Example 5, with the exception that the photochromic dye used in this example was Photo “D” photochromic dye, a spiro-oxazine dye available from Great Lakes Chemical, Inc. in Pedrengo, Italy. The maximum activation wavelength for the Photo “D” photochromic dye was 613 nm.</p>
    <p>After the n-butyl acetate solvent was allowed to evaporate for about 24 hours at room temperature, the functional film <b>21</b> with the photochromic property remained on the glass. The functional film <b>21</b> was gently removed from the glass by first peeling an edge of the film <b>21</b> off the glass with the help of a razor blade. The film <b>21</b>, after evaporation of the solvent, was determined to be about 0.001 mm thick.</p>
    <heading>Example 8</heading> <p>This example demonstrates formation of the functional laminate <b>19</b> using the same procedure set forth in Example 5, with the exception that the functional film <b>21</b> produced in Example 7 was used instead of the functional film <b>21</b> produced in Example 5. The functional laminate <b>19</b> that was produced in this example using the functional film of Example 7 was determined to have an overall thickness of about 0.30 mm. The laminate <b>19</b> of this example was placed in a spectrometer and the total light transmission, without activation of the photochromic dye, was determined to be about 92% over the range of the visible spectrum. The total light transmission was determined to be about 20% at 613 nm when the photochromic dye was activated using light provided by the aforementioned Bondwand 2.25 mw/cm<sup>2 </sup>ultraviolet lamp.</p>
    <heading>Example 9</heading> <p>This example demonstrates formation of the lens <b>10</b> using the functional laminate <b>19</b> produced in Example 8 to incorporate the photochromic property in the lens <b>10</b>. The first step in making the lens <b>10</b> in this example was to cut the plate <b>17</b> the functional laminate <b>19</b> to make the functional portion <b>14</b>. The plate <b>17</b> was generally round in shape and had substantially the same dimensions as the surface <b>18</b> of the power portion <b>12</b> to be made. The plate <b>17</b>, which was not pre-shaped, was placed within the recesses <b>172</b> so that the second sheet <b>24</b> faced the convex surface <b>126</b>. The plate <b>17</b> was observed to have a snug fit within the recesses <b>172</b> that was suitable for creating the mechanical seal. The vacuum source <b>174</b> was activated to 28.5 millimeters of mercury to effect the pneumatic seal and to pull the plate <b>17</b> into registry with the convex surface <b>126</b>.</p>
    <p>The mold halves <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> were then closed to make the mold cavity <b>104</b> using the molding machine <b>100</b>. Molten Lexan® polycarbonate resin was injected into the cavity <b>104</b>. The clamping force of the machine <b>100</b> used in this example was 160 tons, and the resin injection velocity was 1.5 inches per second. The resin melt temperature of the machine <b>100</b> was 585° F., and the mold temperature was 265° F.</p>
    <p>After cooling, the mold halves <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> were opened and the lens <b>10</b> was ejected from the mold half <b>122</b>. It was noted that no injected polycarbonate flowed between the plate <b>17</b> and the convex surface <b>126</b>. Additionally, no delamination of the functional portion <b>14</b> and no warping of the functional film <b>21</b> was observed. Furthermore, the functional portion <b>14</b> and the power portion <b>12</b> were found to be firmly attached to each other. No voids or inclusions were found anywhere in the power portion <b>12</b>, including proximate the functional portion <b>14</b>. After the inspection, the second sheet <b>24</b> of the lens <b>10</b> was coated with the coating <b>32</b> using a conventional dip-coating technique.</p>
    <p>Various tests were carried out on the lens produced in this example. The lens <b>10</b> of this example was placed in a spectrometer and the total light transmission, measured through the power portion <b>12</b> and the functional portion <b>14</b> without activation of the photochromic dye, was determined to be about 90% over the range of the visible spectrum. The total light transmission measured through the power portion <b>12</b> and the functional portion <b>14</b> of the lens <b>10</b> was determined to be about 20% at 613 nm when the photochromic dye was activated using light provided by the aforementioned Bondwand 2.25 mw/cm<sup>2 </sup>ultraviolet lamp.</p>
    <p>The lens <b>10</b> was ground to a finished prescription focal power and was found to have good combined power in the spherical and cylindrical axes. Also, the optical properties of the lens <b>10</b>, including the optical clarity, optical wave, and optical power, were examined using a conventional lensometer apparatus and were found to be excellent.</p>
    <p>Also, the functional portion <b>14</b> of the lens <b>10</b> was tested for delamination and it was observed that the sheets <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> did not delaminate from the functional film <b>21</b>. Additionally, the outside surface <b>34</b> of the lens <b>10</b> was tested for abrasion using the test detailed in ASTM D 3359-78 and found to exhibit superior abrasion resistance.</p>
    <heading>Example 10</heading> <p>This example demonstrates formation of the functional film <b>21</b> from polymeric resin and a different photochromic dye from that used in Example 5. The same procedures and process conditions were used in this example as in Example 5, with the exception that the amount of the cellulose acetate butyrate used, the amount of the photochromic dye used, and the composition of the photochromic dye were changed.</p>
    <p>The amount of the cellulose acetate butyrate used in this example was 19.58 grams. The photochromic dye used in this example was a mixture that included 0.2 grams of the 3-(4-biphenylyl)-3-phenyl-8-methoxy-3H-naphtho[2,1b]pyran photochromic dye used in Example 5, 0.2 grams of the Photo “D” photochromic dye used in Example 7, and 0.02 grams of Photo “PNO” photochromic dye, which is a spirooxazine dye available from Great Lakes Chemical, Inc. in Pedrengo, Italy. The maximum activation wavelength for the 3-(4-biphenylyl)-3-phenyl-8-methoxy-3H-naphtho[2,1b]pyran photochromic dye is 480 nm, the maximum activation wavelength for the Photo “D” photochromic dye is 613 nm, and the maximum activation wavelength for the Photo “PNO” photochromic dye is 540 nm. When activated with sunlight, this mixture of the three different photochromic dyes achieves a neutral grey color, which is a desirable activated color for ophthalmic sunglasses.</p>
    <p>After the n-butyl acetate solvent was allowed to evaporate for about 24 hours at room temperature, the functional film <b>21</b> with the photochromic property remained on the glass. The functional film <b>21</b> was gently removed from the glass by first peeling an edge of the film <b>21</b> off the glass with the help of a razor blade. The film <b>21</b>, after evaporation of the solvent, was determined to be about 0.00122 mm thick.</p>
    <heading>Example 11</heading> <p>This example demonstrates formation of the functional laminate <b>19</b> using the same procedure set forth in Example 5, with the exception that the functional film <b>21</b> produced in Example 10 was used instead of the functional film <b>21</b> produced in Example 5. The functional laminate <b>19</b> that was produced in this example using the functional film of Example 11 was determined to have an overall thickness of about 0.30 mm. The laminate <b>19</b> of this example was placed in a spectrometer and the total light transmission, without activation of the photochromic dye, was determined to be about 90% over the range of the visible spectrum (i.e.: from about 400 nm to about 700 nm). The average total light transmission was determined to be about 25% over the range of the visible spectrum (i.e.: from about 400 nm to about 700 nm) when the photochromic dye was activated using light provided by the aforementioned Bondwand 2.25 mw/cm<sup>2 </sup>ultraviolet lamp.</p>
    <heading>Example 12</heading> <p>This example demonstrates formation of the lens <b>10</b> that is stepped multi-focal, as in FIG. <b>4</b>. The lens <b>10</b> of FIG. 4 was made using the functional laminate <b>19</b> produced in Example 11 to incorporate the photochromic property in the lens <b>10</b>. The procedures of this example were the same as those used in Example 9, with two exceptions. First, the functional laminate <b>19</b> of Example 11, rather than the functional laminate of Example 8, was used in this example. Second, the lens <b>10</b> of FIG. 4, rather than the lens <b>10</b> of FIG. 1, was produced in this example.</p>
    <p>The convex surface <b>126</b> of the molding machine <b>100</b> used in this example was stepped and discontinuous, as compared to the continuous nature of the convex surface <b>126</b> of Example 9. The plate <b>17</b>, which was not pre-shaped, was placed within the recesses <b>172</b> so that the second sheet <b>24</b> faced the convex surface <b>126</b>. The plate <b>17</b> was observed to have a snug fit within the recesses <b>172</b> that was suitable for creating the mechanical seal. The vacuum source <b>174</b> was activated to 28.5 millimeters of mercury to effect the pneumatic seal and to pull the plate <b>17</b> into registry with the convex surface <b>126</b>.</p>
    <p>The mold halves <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> were then closed to make the mold cavity <b>104</b>. Molten Lexan® polycarbonate resin was subsequently injected into the cavity <b>104</b>. After cooling, the mold halves <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> were opened and the lens <b>10</b> was ejected from the mold half <b>122</b>. Upon opening the mold cavity <b>104</b>, it was noted that no injected polycarbonate flowed between the plate <b>17</b> and the convex surface <b>126</b>. Additionally, no delamination of the functional portion <b>14</b> and no warping of the functional film <b>21</b> was observed. Also, it was observed that the functional portion <b>14</b> accurately conformed to the shape of the front surface <b>18</b> of the power portion <b>12</b>, including the main focal surface <b>36</b>, the secondary focal surface <b>38</b>, and the stepped surface <b>40</b> of the power portion. Furthermore, the functional portion <b>14</b> and the power portion <b>12</b> were found to be firmly attached to each other. No voids or inclusions were found anywhere in the power portion <b>12</b>, including proximate the functional portion <b>14</b>. After the inspection, the second sheet <b>24</b> of the lens <b>10</b> was coated as specified in Example 9.</p>
    <p>Various tests were carried out on the lens produced in this example. The lens <b>10</b> of this example was placed in a spectrometer and the total light transmission, measured through the power portion <b>12</b> and the functional portion <b>14</b> without activation of the photochromic dye, was determined to be about 90% over the range of the visible spectrum (i.e.: from about 400 nm to about 700 nm). The average total light transmission measured through the power portion <b>12</b> and the functional portion <b>14</b> of the lens <b>10</b> was determined to be about 25% over the range of the visible spectrum (i.e.: from about 400 nm to about 700 nm) when the photochromic dye was activated using light provided by the aforementioned Bondwand 2.25 mw/cm<sup>2 </sup>ultraviolet lamp.</p>
    <p>The lens <b>10</b> of this example was ground to a finished prescription focal power and was found to have good combined power in the spherical and cylindrical axes. Also, the lens <b>10</b> of this example was determined to have a 6.25 diopter curve with a 1.02 multi-focal additive power. Furthermore, the optical properties of the lens <b>10</b>, including the optical clarity, optical wave, and optical power, were examined using a conventional lensometer apparatus and were found to be excellent.</p>
    <p>Also, the functional portion <b>14</b> of the lens <b>10</b> was tested for delamination and it was observed that the sheets <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> did not delaminate from the functional film <b>21</b>. Additionally, the outside surface <b>34</b> of the lens <b>10</b> was tested for abrasion using the test detailed in ASTM D 3359-78 and found to exhibit superior abrasion resistance.</p>
    <p>Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
