    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>The present invention relates to a dual bit nonvolatile programmable read/write memory, a method of manufacturing the same, and a method of driving the same.</p>
    <p>2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p>In the flash memory, the limit of miniaturization is decided by limits in the reduction in the voltages, the cell area, and the electrostatic capacity scaling. In contrast, the realization of the multivalue operation per one element is expected as the element technology to meet the trend of cost reduction.</p>
    <p>Also, there is the memory like the mask ROM, which does not need the reprogramming, among the nonvolatile memories and it is desired to supply the product at a low price. In this case, the realization of the multivalue operation per one element is also watched with interest as the element technology to meet the lower cost.</p>
    <p>Under such circumstances, the structure of the nonvolatile memory that makes it possible to realize the multivalue operation per one element is disclosed in the U.S. Patent (U.S. Pat. No. 6,011,725).</p>
    <p>According to this Patent, the localization of the trapped charge by the MONOS (Metal Oxide Nitride Oxide Semiconductor) structure is utilized to obtain the 2-bit 4-value states. This system is the unique system that utilizes the event that the threshold value of the device can be decided by the fixed charges located locally near the source region and also the source region and the drain region are exchanged in operation, so that 2-bit (i.e., 4-value states) data can be generated by one transistor.</p>
    <p>In FIG. <b>1</b>A and FIG. 1B of this application, the similar element structure to that of the above U.S. Patent is shown. More particularly, the source/drain regions <b>6</b> <i>a, </i> <b>6</b> <i>b </i>serving as the source or the drain are formed at a distance on the surface of the one conductivity type semiconductor substrate <b>1</b>, and the ONO (Oxide Nitride Oxide) structure in which the nitride film <b>3</b> is sandwiched by oxide films <b>2</b>, <b>4</b> is formed on the channel region between them, and the control gate <b>5</b> is formed on the ONO structure. The overall stacked structure constitutes the MONOS structure.</p>
    <p>In the programming of data, the avalanche breakdown is caused in the pn junction, that consists of the source/drain region <b>6</b> <i>a </i>or <b>6</b> <i>b </i>and the semiconductor substrate <b>1</b>, by applying the program voltage to the source/drain region <b>6</b> <i>a </i>or <b>6</b> <i>b </i>to generate hot electrons. The electrons are injected into the ONO structure near the pn junction, and then trapped by the electron trap in the nitride film <b>3</b>. At this time, normally the trapped electrons are located locally in the nitride film <b>3</b> near the pn junction.</p>
    <p>FIG. 1B shows the state that the accumulated charges (trapped electrons) <b>7</b> <i>a </i>and <b>7</b> <i>b </i>are located locally in vicinity of the source/drain regions <b>6</b> <i>a </i>and <b>6</b> <i>b </i>respectively when the program voltage (Vpp) is applied separately to the source/drain regions <b>6</b> <i>a </i>and <b>6</b> <i>b </i>respectively. This state shows one state of the 2-bit 4-value states.</p>
    <p>In the reading of this data, the current in one direction is detected while using the source/drain region <b>6</b> <i>a </i>as the source and the source/drain region <b>6</b> <i>b </i>as the drain, and then conversely the current in the opposite direction is detected while using the source/drain region <b>6</b> <i>b </i>as the source and the source/drain region <b>6</b> <i>a </i>as the drain. In both cases, since the accumulated charges <b>7</b> <i>a </i>or <b>7</b> <i>b </i>exist on the source side and thus the electric field to turn off the channel is generated, the detected current is small to indicate the “OFF” state.</p>
    <p>However, problems described in the following still remain in the above nonvolatile memory.</p>
    <p>(i) Programming Control</p>
    <p>In the programming, as described above, normally the trapped electrons are located locally near the pn junction. However, there is the possibility that the trapped electron distribution in the nitride film is expanded by the excessive programming. In this case, since asymmetry of the operation is lost because the localization of the trapped electrons cannot be implemented, it is impossible to execute the dual bit operation. In order to prevent such excessive programming, the precise control of the programming time is needed.</p>
    <p>Also, even if the precise control of the programming time can be carried out, the channel length must be set long to some extent in view of the expansion of the trapped electron distribution in the nitride film to locate locally the charges on both sides of the nitride film at the same time. Therefore, it may be concluded that the structure in the prior art is not suitable for the higher density achieved by the miniaturization.</p>
    <p>(ii) Variation in the Threshold Value</p>
    <p>Since the avalanche breakdown is caused locally, it is difficult to localize the fixed charged uniformly over the overall area along the channel width direction shown in FIG. <b>1</b>A.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>It is an object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor memory device which has high reliability and makes it possible to achieve miniaturization and a higher density, and each element of which is operated at multi-values.</p>
    <p>It is another object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor memory device capable of achieving lower voltages in a programming voltage and much more expanding a current window defined later.</p>
    <p>It is still another object of the present invention to provide a method of manufacturing the above semiconductor memory device.</p>
    <p>It is yet still another object of the present invention to provide a method of driving the above semiconductor memory device.</p>
    <p>The gist of the inventions set forth in claims will be explained hereunder. In this case, some portions will be explained with reference to the drawings. This intends to explain contents of the invention comprehensively, but this does not intend to limit the scope of the invention.</p>
    <p>A semiconductor memory device set forth in claim 1 of the present invention containing a semiconductor memory element, the element comprises a one conductivity type semiconductor substrate in which convex portions having a pair of opposing side surfaces is provided, a pair of opposite conductivity type source/drain regions formed on a surface of the semiconductor substrate on both sides of the convex portion, a first insulating film for covering upper surface of the convex portion, second insulating films for covering the side surfaces of the convex portion and the source/drain regions, a pair of floating gates provided on the sides surfaces of the convex portions to oppose to the side surfaces and the source/drain regions via the second insulating film respectively, third insulating films formed on the floating gates, and control gate opposing to the upper surface of the convex portion via the first insulating film and opposing to the floating gates via the third insulating films respectively.</p>
    <p>In this case, as set forth in claim <b>2</b>, a region neighboring to the side surfaces and upper surface of the convex portion put between a pair of the source/drain regions acts as a channel region, and a pair of floating gates act as charge accumulating regions for accumulating charges.</p>
    <p>In the present invention, two bits are formed per one element by a pair of the floating gates, and 4-value states can be formed by possible combinations of the charge accumulation or no charge accumulation into the one floating gate and the charge accumulation or no charge accumulation into the other floating gate.</p>
    <p>Also, since the floating gates are provided on both side surfaces of the convex portion formed on the surface of the semiconductor substrate and also side surfaces of the convex portion are utilized as a channel respectively, a element forming area can be reduced. Also, since the source/drain regions are provided under the floating gates, the higher density of the semiconductor memory device can be achieved.</p>
    <p>In the programming, hot carriers (high energy carriers) generated by the electric field directed from the source to the drain are employed as the injection charge. At this time, the energy required for the hot carriers to exceed the energy barrier of the gate insulating film is supplied by applying the necessary voltage for programming to the drain. More particularly, as shown in FIG. 6, the carriers extracted from the source are accelerated during the traveling in the channel region to get the energy, and then exceeds the energy barrier of the gate insulating film <b>22</b> to jump into the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>b. </i>At this time, since the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>b </i>is present in the acceleration direction of the carriers in the channel on the upper surface of the convex portion, the carriers are injected into the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>b </i>as they are without the change of direction. Accordingly, the energy of the carriers accelerated in a direction of the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>b </i>is never lost by scattering and is practically used as the energy to exceed the energy barrier of the gate insulating film <b>22</b> as they are. Therefore, according to the present invention, it is possible to execute the programming by the low voltage.</p>
    <p>Also, since a pair of floating gates as the charge accumulating portions are separately mutually to put the convex portion between them, in the programming, the charges injected into the floating gates do not interfere mutually, and thus contents of the data can be clearly distinguished. In addition, since the floating gates are formed of the conductor, the injected hot carriers (charges) can be distributed uniformly in the floating gates. Accordingly, “ON”/“OFF” of the transistors can be controlled perfectly.</p>
    <p>Further, during the programming, in the non-selected cell transistor, 0 V is applied to the control gate and the source, and the programming voltage is applied to the drain, but the potential of the floating gates is pulled up to the drain potential by the coupling capacitance between the drain and the floating gate. Therefore, the potential difference between the drain and the floating gate is reduced. As a result, the dielectric breakdown due to the inter-band tunneling, etc. that are caused by the high electric field to the insulating film between the drain and the floating gate can be prevented.</p>
    <p>In addition, since the floating gates are provided on the source/drain regions via the insulating film, the potential of the floating gate is largely affected by the drain voltage via the coupling capacitance. Accordingly, since the potential of the floating gate is pulled up by the drain voltage even if the injected electrons are accumulated in the floating gate on the drain side, a drain current can be increased.</p>
    <p>In contrast, the potential of the floating gate on the source side is pulled down by the source voltage applied to the source via the coupling capacitance of the insulating film between the floating gate and the source. Therefore, the potential of the floating gate that is pulled down by the injected electrons into the floating gate on the source side is further pulled down by the source voltage. As a result, even if the high voltage is applied to the control gate, the channel can be still cut off.</p>
    <p>The pulling-up of the potential of the floating gate by the above drain voltage and the pulling-down of the potential of the floating gate by the source voltage can generate the effect to increase the so-called “current window”. Here, the current window is the index of the margin in a discrimination of “ON” state and “OFF” state. In other words, it is a difference between the lowest level of the drain current indicating the “ON” state and the highest level of the drain current indicating the “OFF” state. More particularly, it is corresponding to the difference between the drain current values obtained when the voltages are applied in different directions between the drain and the source of the memory element in which “1” is programmed onto one floating gate only.</p>
    <p>Also, in the semiconductor memory device set forth in claims <b>4</b> to <b>9</b>, a plurality of semiconductor elements are arranged in columns and rows.</p>
    <p>In claim <b>4</b>, the semiconductor convex portions in which the memory elements are formed at intersecting regions of the rows and the columns are arranged like the islands to implement the element isolation such that the mutual interference between neighboring memory elements is not generated.</p>
    <p>While, in claims <b>5</b> to <b>9</b>, a plurality of memory elements are formed on the stripe-shaped convex portions. In this manner, in case the memory elements are left discontinuously at a distance in the stripe-shaped convex portion in one column, high concentration impurity regions (element isolation layers) are formed between neighboring memory elements to accomplish isolation between the elements without fail.</p>
    <p>In the semiconductor memory device driving method of the present invention, the programming of the data, the reading of the stored data, and the erasing of the programmed and stored data can be carried out as follows.</p>
    <p>The programming of the data is carried out in the following way. That is, the voltage is applied to at least any one of a pair of the source/drain regions <b>23</b> <i>a, </i> <b>23</b> <i>b, </i>for example, the source/drain region <b>23</b> <i>b </i>in FIG. <b>6</b>. And then, the high-energy carriers that can exceed the energy barrier of the insulating film <b>22</b> are generated in the electric field which is built in the peripheral region of the source/drain region <b>23</b> <i>a, </i> <b>23</b> <i>b </i>and the channel region, to inject and accumulate the charges in the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
    <p>Also, as shown in FIG. 7A to FIG. 7D, the reading of the stored data is carried out to pass drain currents through a transistor while exchanging a source and drain of the transistor and to detect the drain currents.</p>
    <p>More particularly, in case that the source/drain region <b>23</b> <i>a </i>or <b>23</b> <i>b </i>on the side of the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>a </i>or <b>27</b> <i>b </i>in which the charges are accumulated is used as the source, the accumulated charges produce the potential to turn off the channel. In addition, since a potential of the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>a </i>or <b>27</b> <i>b </i>is pulled down by the high coupling capacitance between the floating gate and the source to lower its potential, the drain current can be easily cut off by a small amount of the accumulated charges.</p>
    <p>In contrast, in case the source/drain region <b>23</b> <i>a </i>or <b>23</b> <i>b </i>on the side of the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>a </i>or <b>27</b> <i>b </i>in which the charges are accumulated is used as the drain, a potential of the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>a </i>or <b>27</b> <i>b </i>is pulled up by the high coupling capacitance to increase its potential close to the drain voltage. Therefore, even if the accumulated charges are present in the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>a </i>or <b>27</b> <i>b, </i>the influence on the drain current is small and thus the current value is not so reduced.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 7D, in the case that the accumulated charges are present in both the floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a </i>and <b>27</b> <i>b, </i>the drain current is brought into the cut-off state on the basis of the above operation in either case if any one of the floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a </i>and <b>27</b> <i>b </i>is set to the source side or the drain side. Because the accumulated charges are present in the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>a </i>or <b>27</b> <i>b </i>of the source side in either case.</p>
    <p>Also, as shown in FIG. <b>7</b>B and FIG. 7C, in case that the accumulated charges are present in any one of the floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a </i>and <b>27</b> <i>b, </i>the drain current is brought into the cut-off state when the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>a </i>or <b>27</b> <i>b </i>in which the charges are accumulated is set to the source side, but the drain current flows when the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>a </i>or <b>27</b> <i>b </i>in which the charges are accumulated is set to the drain side. In other words, the drain current flows or not depending on the direction of the voltage that is applied between the source and the drain.</p>
    <p>In addition, as shown in FIG. 7A, if the charges are accumulated in neither the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>a </i>nor <b>27</b> <i>b, </i>the potential of the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>a </i>or <b>27</b> <i>b </i>is increased by the gate voltage applied to the control gate <b>30</b> <i>a. </i>For this reason, the “ON” state of the channel is maintained, and thus the drain current still flows even if the direction of the applied voltage between the source and the drain is changed.</p>
    <p>In this manner, if the voltages are applied while the source and the drain are exchanged and then the currents passing through the transistor are detected, it is possible to detect four different states.</p>
    <p>Further, since the floating gates and the source/drain regions are overlapped with each other, it is possible to exhaust the charges accumulated in the floating gates into the source/drain regions in erasing the stored data.</p>
    <p>Besides, in the semiconductor memory device manufacturing method set forth in claim <b>10</b>, the convex portions each having a pair of opposing side surfaces are formed, and then the opposite conductivity type impurities are introduced into a surface layer of the semiconductor substrate on both sides of the convex portion such that two source/drain regions are formed on both sides of the convex portion to put the convex portion between them. In addition, a pair of floating gates are formed on the side surfaces of the stripe-shaped convex portion via the insulating film (second insulating film) by anisotropic-etching the first conductive film.</p>
    <p>In this manner, according to the semiconductor memory device manufacturing method, since the source/drain regions and the floating gates can be formed in a self-alignment manner, further miniaturization can be achieved.</p>
    <p>Moreover, as shown in FIG. 10H, the thick insulating films <b>34</b> are formed in the regions which are located on the common source/drain regions <b>23</b> <i>a, </i> <b>23</b> <i>b </i>between the convex portions <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>and in which the source/drain regions <b>23</b> <i>a, </i> <b>23</b> <i>b </i>oppose to the control gates <b>30</b> <i>a, </i> <b>30</b> <i>b </i>formed later. As a result, the dielectric-breakdown resistance of the semiconductor memory device can be improved.</p>

    <p>(1) Configuration of Semiconductor Memory Device</p>
    <p>FIG. 2 is a perspective view showing a configuration of a semiconductor memory device according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 2, in the semiconductor memory device, a plurality of convex silicon layers (one conductivity type stripe-shaped convex portions) <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b, </i>. . . are provided in the column direction at a distance mutually on a semiconductor substrate, and control gates <b>30</b> <i>a, </i> <b>30</b> <i>b, </i>. . . are provided in the row direction at a distance mutually thereon. Semiconductor memory elements (transistors) Tr are formed on convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b, </i>. . . in their intersecting areas.</p>
    <p>(Basic Configuration of Semiconductor Memory Element)</p>
    <p>A basic configuration of the transistor (semiconductor memory element) located in the intersecting area of the control gate <b>30</b> <i>a </i>and the convex silicon layer <b>24</b> <i>a </i>among the transistors Tr shown in FIG. 2 will be explained with reference to FIG. 3B hereinafter.</p>
    <p>In the transistor, the p-type convex silicon layer <b>24</b> <i>a </i>having a pair of opposing side surfaces is provided to project from a surface of a p-type silicon base body <b>21</b>. They constitute a semiconductor substrate.</p>
    <p>A pair of n-type source/drain regions <b>23</b> <i>a, </i> <b>23</b> <i>b </i>are formed on the surface of the silicon base body <b>21</b> on both sides of the convex silicon layer <b>24</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p>An upper surface of the convex silicon layer <b>24</b> <i>a </i>is covered with a first gate insulating film (first insulating film) <b>22</b> <i>a </i>made of a silicon oxide film. Side surfaces of the convex silicon layer <b>24</b> <i>a </i>and surfaces of first and second source/drain regions <b>23</b> <i>a, </i> <b>23</b> <i>b </i>are covered with a second insulating film <b>22</b> made of the silicon oxide film.</p>
    <p>A first floating gate <b>27</b> <i>a </i>is provided from one side surface of the convex silicon layer <b>24</b> <i>a </i>to a surface of the first source/drain region <b>23</b> <i>a </i>via the second insulating film <b>22</b>. A second floating gate <b>27</b> <i>b </i>is provided from the other side surface of the convex silicon layer <b>24</b> <i>a </i>to a surface of the second source/drain region <b>23</b> <i>b </i>via the second insulating film <b>22</b>. Overall bottom surfaces of the floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>are located on corresponding source/drain regions <b>23</b> <i>a, </i> <b>23</b> <i>b </i>respectively. The first and second floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>are formed of conductor such as polysilicon with low resistance, etc., for example. A pair of floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>act as a charge accumulating portion for accumulating the charges.</p>
    <p>The second insulating film <b>22</b> put between the floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>and the convex silicon layer <b>24</b> <i>a </i>serves as the second gate insulating film. It is preferable that a film thickness of the second insulating film <b>22</b> should be set to less than 100 nm such that the hot carriers being traveling in the channel can exceed the energy barrier of the second insulating film <b>22</b> and that the electric field by the accumulated charges can have an enough influence on the channel. On the other hand, it is preferable that the film thickness should be set to more than 3 nm such that the leakage of the accumulated charges can be reduced as small as possible. Also, surfaces of the floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>are covered with third insulating films <b>29</b> made of the silicon oxide film.</p>
    <p>A control gate <b>30</b> <i>a </i>is provided to extend on the first floating gate <b>27</b> <i>a, </i>an upper surface of the convex silicon layer <b>24</b> <i>a, </i>and the second floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b. </i>The control gate <b>30</b> <i>a </i>opposes to the upper surface of the convex silicon layer <b>24</b> <i>a </i>via the first insulating film <b>22</b> <i>a, </i>and also opposes to the floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>via the third insulating films <b>29</b>.</p>
    <p>A region that is put between the first and second source/drain regions <b>23</b> <i>a, </i> <b>23</b> <i>b </i>and extends from one side surface of the convex silicon layer <b>24</b> <i>a </i>to the other side surface thereof via an upper surface of the convex silicon layer <b>24</b> <i>a </i>acts as the channel.</p>
    <p>In the above configuration, the coupling capacitances between the respective parts are arranged as shown in FIG. <b>4</b>. More particularly, there are a coupling capacitance C<b>01</b> by the insulating films <b>22</b> <i>a </i>and a coupling capacitance C<b>02</b> by the depletion layer generated in the convex silicon layer <b>24</b> <i>a </i>between the control gate <b>30</b> <i>a </i>and the substrate <b>21</b>.</p>
    <p>Also, there are coupling capacitances C<b>11</b>, C<b>21</b> between the floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>and the control gate <b>30</b> <i>a </i>respectively.</p>
    <p>Also, there are coupling capacitances C<b>12</b>, C<b>22</b> between the floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>and the corresponding source/drain regions <b>23</b> <i>a, </i> <b>23</b> <i>b </i>respectively.</p>
    <p>Also, there are coupling capacitances C<b>13</b>, C<b>23</b> generated by the insulating films <b>22</b> and coupling capacitances C<b>14</b>, C<b>24</b> generated by the depletion layer in the convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a </i>between the floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>and the substrate <b>21</b>.</p>
    <p>(Overall Configuration of Semiconductor Memory Device)</p>
    <p>Next, an overall configuration of the semiconductor memory device containing peripheral circuits will be explained hereunder.</p>
    <p>As explained above with reference to FIG. 2, the transistors Tr are arranged in rows and columns in the semiconductor memory device.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 2, the transistors Tr aligned in a column are arranged discontinuously at a distance on the convex silicon layer <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b, </i>. . . In this case, the element isolation can be executed without fail by putting the high concentration impurity regions (element isolation layers) <b>24</b> <i>s </i>. . . between operation layers <b>24</b> <i>t </i>of neighboring transistors Tr. As shown in FIG. <b>11</b>A and FIG. 11B, the mutual interference between the neighboring transistors Tr may be prevented by removing regions between the neighboring transistors Tr in one column. A detail structure is described in the subsequent term of manufacturing method.</p>
    <p>Once again, as shown in FIG. 2, the source/drain regions <b>23</b> <i>b </i>put between the convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>in the neighboring columns are formed integrally, and are used in common between the transistors Tr in the neighboring columns. This structure is similarly true of the transistors Tr in other neighboring columns. The source/drain regions <b>23</b> <i>a, </i> <b>23</b> <i>b, </i>. . . function as the bit lines (BL) respectively.</p>
    <p>In addition, the control gates <b>30</b> <i>a, </i> <b>30</b> <i>b </i>are provided to extend over a plurality of transistors in the neighboring columns. The control gates <b>30</b> <i>a, </i> <b>30</b> <i>b </i>oppose to the source/drain regions <b>23</b> <i>a, </i> <b>23</b> <i>b, </i>. . . via a thick insulating film <b>34</b> in the concave portion <b>31</b> between the floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>of the transistors of neighboring columns. The thick insulating film <b>34</b> has a film thickness that is thicker than the insulating film on the peripheral portion.</p>
    <p>The control gates <b>30</b> <i>a, </i> <b>30</b> <i>b </i>are formed of a stripe-shaped polysilicon film (conductive film) and act as the word lines (WL) respectively.</p>
    <p>A silicon oxide film <b>36</b>, although it is not shown in FIG. 2, is formed on the overall surface of the element as shown in FIG. <b>3</b>B.</p>
    <p>Next, an example of peripheral circuits of the semiconductor memory device will be explained hereinafter.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5 is a circuit diagram showing a 2-row 2-column partial arrangement of the transistors out of the overall arrangement of a plurality of transistors that are arranged in rows and columns, and a program voltage supply portion and a sense amplifier portion of peripheral circuits.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 5, the program voltage supply portion and the sense amplifier are connected to the source/drain regions <b>23</b> <i>a, </i> <b>23</b> <i>b, </i> <b>23</b> <i>c </i>. . . by the bit lines BL<b>1</b>, BL<b>2</b>, BL<b>3</b> via the program/sense amplifier selector. The word lines WL<b>1</b>, WL<b>2</b> are connected to the control gates <b>30</b> <i>a, </i> <b>30</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
    <p>Any one of the program voltage supply portion and the sense amplifier is selected by the program/sense amplifier selector to be connected to the bit lines BL<b>1</b>, BL<b>2</b>, BL<b>3</b>.</p>
    <p>The data are programmed in the transistor Tr by the program voltage supply portion. Then, the stored data are read out with the sense amplifier by detecting respective currents which pass through the transistor Tr while current directions are exchanged between the neighboring bit lines BL<b>1</b>/BL<b>2</b>, BL<b>2</b>/BL<b>3</b>.</p>
    <p>As described above, according to the semiconductor memory device of the embodiment of the present invention, two bits per one element are formed by a pair of floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b, </i>and four values can be formed by possible combinations of the charge accumulation or no charge accumulation into the first floating gate <b>27</b> <i>a </i>and the charge accumulation or no charge accumulation into the second floating gate <b>27</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
    <p>Also, since the floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>are provided on both side surfaces of the convex silicon layer <b>24</b> <i>a </i>formed on the surface of the semiconductor base body <b>21</b> and the side surfaces of the convex silicon layer <b>24</b> <i>a </i>are utilized as the channel, the element forming area can be reduced. Also, since the source/drain regions <b>23</b> <i>a, </i> <b>23</b> <i>b </i>are provided under the floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b, </i>the higher density of the semiconductor memory device can be achieved.</p>
    <p>Also, the thick insulating film <b>34</b> is provided between the control gates <b>30</b> <i>a, </i> <b>30</b> <i>b </i>and the source/drain regions <b>23</b> <i>a, </i> <b>23</b> <i>b </i>in areas where the control gates <b>30</b> <i>a, </i> <b>30</b> <i>b </i>oppose to the source/drain regions <b>23</b> <i>a, </i> <b>23</b> <i>b </i>and thus the high potential difference is generated. Therefore, the dielectric breakdown in these areas can be prevented.</p>
    <p>(2) Semiconductor Memory Device Driving Method</p>
    <p>Next, a semiconductor memory device driving method as an embodiment of the present invention will be explained by using the semiconductor memory device in FIG. <b>2</b> and with reference to FIG. 6A, FIG. 6B, FIG. 7A to FIG. 7D, FIG. <b>8</b> and FIG. 9 hereunder.</p>
    <p>(i) Programming Operation</p>
    <p>FIG. 6A is a sectional view showing generating and moving behaviors of the hot carries (high energy carries) in the peripheral portions of the floating gates <b>23</b> <i>a, </i> <b>23</b> <i>b </i>in the programming operation in the driving method. FIG. 6B is a sectional view showing an aspect of the non-selected semiconductor memory element in the programming operation.</p>
    <p>In this embodiment, as shown in FIG. 6A, the charges of the hot carriers are accumulated in the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>b </i>on the drain region <b>23</b> <i>b </i>side. The first source/drain region <b>23</b> <i>a </i>is used as the source and the second source/drain region <b>23</b> <i>b </i>is used as the drain. In the programming, the hot carries generated by the electric field directed from the source region <b>23</b> <i>a </i>to the drain region <b>23</b> <i>b </i>are employed as the injection carriers.</p>
    <p>In order to execute the programming operation, the programming voltage (Vpp) of about ±4.5 V is applied to the drain region <b>23</b> <i>b </i>and the control gate <b>30</b> <i>a, </i>and the source region <b>23</b> <i>a </i>is set to 0 V.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, the electric field directed from the source <b>23</b> <i>a </i>to the drain <b>23</b> <i>b </i>is generated in the channel of the convex silicon layer <b>24</b> <i>a. </i>The electrons extracted from the source region <b>23</b> <i>a </i>are accelerated by the electric field during when they are traveling the channel to get the energy, and exceed the energy barrier of the gate insulating film <b>22</b> to jump into the second floating gate <b>27</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
    <p>At this time, since the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>b </i>exists on the upper channel of the convex silicon layer <b>24</b> <i>a </i>in the acceleration direction of the electrons, the electrons are injected into the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>b </i>as it is not to change their direction. Therefore, the energy of the electrons accelerated in the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>b </i>direction is used practically as the energy to exceed the potential of the gate insulating film <b>22</b> as it is without the loss due to the scattering. As a result, it is possible to execute the programming by the low voltage.</p>
    <p>Also, since a pair of floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>serving as the charge accumulating portions are separated mutually to put the convex silicon layer <b>24</b> <i>a </i>between them, the charges injected into the floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>never interfere with each other and thus contents of the programming data can be clearly distinguished. In addition, since the floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>are formed of the conductor, the injected hot carriers (charges) can be distributed uniformly in the floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b. </i>Accordingly, the “ON”/“OFF” of the transistors can be controlled perfectly.</p>
    <p>In this case, the hot electrons that exceed the energy barriers of the insulating films <b>22</b> <i>a, </i> <b>29</b> and are injected into the control gate <b>30</b> <i>a </i>are exhausted immediately to the power supply connected to the control gate <b>30</b> <i>a </i>via the control gate <b>30</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p>Further, during the programming of the data, as shown in FIG. 6B, in the non-selected transistor, 0 V is applied to the control gate <b>30</b> <i>a </i>and the source <b>23</b> <i>a, </i>and the programming voltage Vpp (Vd) is applied to the drain <b>23</b> <i>b </i>via the bit line connected to the selected transistor. But the potential of the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>b </i>is pulled up to the drain potential Vd (Vpp) by the coupling capacitance between the drain <b>23</b> <i>b </i>and the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>b. </i>Therefore, the potential difference between the drain <b>23</b> <i>b </i>and the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>b </i>is reduced. As a result, the dielectric breakdown due to the inter-band tunneling, etc. that are caused by the high electric field to the insulating film <b>22</b> between the drain <b>23</b> <i>b </i>and the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>b </i>can be prevented.</p>
    <p>The four-value states as shown in FIG. 7A, FIG. 7B, FIG. <b>7</b>C and FIG. 7D can be formed by executing the programming operation as shown in FIG. <b>6</b>A.</p>
    <p>FIG. 7A, FIG. 7B, FIG. <b>7</b>C and FIG. 7D are sectional views of the semiconductor memory element showing four different charge accumulation states respectively.</p>
    <p>Here, the state that the carriers are accumulated in the first floating gate <b>27</b> <i>a </i>is set as the first binary value of the first bit, and the state that the carriers are not accumulated in the first floating gate <b>27</b> <i>a </i>is set as the second binary value of the first bit. Also, the state that the carriers are accumulated in the second floating gate <b>27</b> <i>b </i>is set as the third binary value of the second bit, and the state that the carriers are not accumulated in the second floating gate <b>27</b> <i>b </i>is set as the fourth binary value of the second bit.</p>
    <p>FIG. 7A shows the state that the charges are not accumulated in both the first and second floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b. </i>In other words, FIG. 7A shows such a data that the second binary value is set in the first bit and also the fourth binary value is set in the second bit. This data is represented as (0, 0).</p>
    <p>FIG. 7B shows the state that the charges are accumulated only in the first floating gate <b>27</b> <i>a. </i>In other words, FIG. 7B shows such a data that the first binary value is set in the first bit and also the fourth binary value is set in the second bit. This data is represented as (1, 0).</p>
    <p>FIG. 7C shows the state that the charges are accumulated only in the second floating gate <b>27</b> <i>b. </i>In other words, FIG. 7C shows such a data that the second binary value is set in the first bit and also the third binary value is set in the second bit. This data is represented as (0, 1).</p>
    <p>FIG. 7D shows the state that the charges are accumulated in both the first and second floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b. </i>In other words, FIG. 7D shows such a data that the first binary value is set in the first bit and also the third binary value is set in the second bit. This data is represented as (1, 1).</p>
    <p>(ii) Reading Operation</p>
    <p>Next, an operation of reading the data programmed as described above will be explained with reference to FIG. 7A, FIG. 7B, FIG. 7C, FIG. <b>7</b>D and FIG. 8 hereunder.</p>
    <p>FIG. 8 is a graph showing the characteristic of the drain current id with respect to the drain voltage Vd.</p>
    <p>In FIG. 7A, FIG. 7B, FIG. 7C, and FIG. 7D, assume that the detected current directed from the second source/drain region <b>23</b> <i>b </i>to the first source/drain region <b>23</b> <i>a </i>is id<b>1</b> (indicated by a solid line), and the detected current flowing in the opposite direction to the current id<b>1</b> is id<b>2</b> (indicated by a dotted line).</p>
    <p>In the reading operation of the stored data, the gate voltage Vcg (2.3 V) is applied to the control gate <b>30</b> <i>a. </i>The read voltage Vd (1.5 V) is applied to the second source/drain region <b>23</b> <i>b </i>as the drain. The first source/drain region <b>23</b> <i>a </i>as the source is grounded (Vs=0V). At this time, since the drain current id<b>1</b> flows between the source region <b>23</b> <i>a </i>and the drain region <b>23</b> <i>b, </i>such drain current id<b>1</b> is detected.</p>
    <p>In turn, the gate voltage Vcg (2.3 V) is applied to the control gate <b>30</b> <i>a. </i>The read voltage Vd (1.5 V) is applied to the first source/drain region <b>23</b> <i>a </i>as the drain. The second source/drain region <b>23</b> <i>b </i>as the source is grounded. At this time, since the drain current id<b>2</b> flows between the source <b>23</b> <i>b </i>and the drain <b>23</b> <i>a, </i>such drain current id<b>2</b> is detected.</p>
    <p>In the reading operation of the data (0, 0), since the electrons are not accumulated in both the floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b, </i>their potentials are not pulled down. Therefore, the potentials of the floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>are pulled up by the gate voltage Vcg and the drain voltage Vd. Also, since the charge accumulation state is bilaterally symmetric, both the drain currents id<b>1</b>, id<b>2</b> have a large value even if the source and the drain are exchanged. The id-Vd characteristic of the drain current id<b>1</b> is shown in FIG. <b>8</b>.</p>
    <p>In the reading operation of the data (1, 0), first the gate voltage Vcg and the drain voltage Vd are applied as explained above in order to detect the drain current id<b>1</b>. The potential of the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>a </i>on the source side, in which the charges are accumulated, is pulled down by the accumulated electrons. In addition, the potential of the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>a </i>on the source side is pulled down by the source voltage Vs via the coupling capacitance between the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>a </i>and the source <b>23</b> <i>a. </i>Therefore, the channel can be still cut off irrespective of the application of the gate voltage Vcg and the drain voltage Vd. As a result, the drain current id<b>1</b> can be reduced.</p>
    <p>Then, the source and the drain are exchanged. In order to detect the drain current id<b>2</b>, the gate voltage Vcg and the drain voltage Vd are applied as explained above. The potential of the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>b </i>on the source <b>23</b> <i>b </i>side, in which the electrons are not accumulated, is pulled up by the gate voltage Vcg. In contrast, the potential of the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>a </i>on the drain <b>23</b> <i>a </i>side, in which the electrons are accumulated, is pulled up by the gate voltage Vcg and the drain voltage Vd via the coupling capacitance. Therefore, even if the electrons are accumulated in the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>a </i>on the drain <b>23</b> <i>a </i>side, the channel can be turned on and thus the drain current id<b>2</b> can be relatively increased.</p>
    <p>FIG. 8 shows the drain current id<b>1</b> in the “OFF” state when the first source/drain region <b>23</b> <i>a </i>on the first floating gate <b>27</b> <i>a </i>side in which the electrons are accumulated is used as the source.</p>
    <p>In the reading operation of the data (0, 1), since the electron accumulation states are opposite laterally to that obtained when the data is (1, 0), the magnitudes of the detected drain currents id<b>1</b>, id<b>2</b> are reversed from those in the data (1, 0). FIG. 8 shows the drain current id<b>1</b> in the “ON” state obtained when the first source/drain region <b>23</b> <i>a </i>on the first floating gate <b>27</b> <i>a </i>side in which the electrons are not accumulated serves as the source.</p>
    <p>In case of reading the data (1, 0) and data (0, 1), the pulling-up of the floating gate potential by the above drain voltage Vd and the pulling-down of the floating gate potential by the source voltage Vs make it possible to generate the effect of increasing the so-called “current window”. Here, the current window acts as the index of the margin to discriminate the “ON” state and the “OFF” state. In other words, this current window is the difference between the lowest level of the drain current in the “ON” state and the highest level of the drain current in the “OFF” state. More particularly, it is corresponding to the difference between the drain current values obtained when the voltage is applied in different directions between the drain and the source of the memory element, in which “1” is programed onto one floating gate only.</p>
    <p>The current window in FIG. 8 is indicated by the difference between the drain current id<b>1</b> of the “ON” state in the read of data (0, 1) and the drain current id<b>1</b> of the “off” state in the read of data (1, 0).</p>
    <p>Next, in the reading operation of the data (1, 1), since the electrons are accumulated in both the floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a </i>and <b>27</b> <i>b, </i>the potentials of the floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a </i>and <b>27</b> <i>b </i>are pulled down. And also since the charge accumulation state is bilaterally symmetric, both the drain currents id<b>1</b>, id<b>2</b> are reduced to the very small value. The id-Vd characteristic of the drain current id<b>1</b> is shown in FIG. <b>8</b>.</p>
    <p>After this, the first bit and the second bit are read by identifying combinations of the magnitudes of the current values and the directions of the currents as for the drain currents id<b>1</b>, id<b>2</b> detected as above.</p>
    <p>As described above, in the reading operation of the stored data by using the semiconductor memory device of this embodiment, since the reading of the stored data can be carried out based on the wide current window, the four-value states can be read to distinguish clearly.</p>
    <p>(iii) Erasing Operation</p>
    <p>Next, an operation of erasing the stored data will be explained hereunder.</p>
    <p>In order to erase the stored data, as shown in FIG. 9, for example, the control gates <b>30</b> <i>a, </i> <b>30</b> <i>b, </i>. . . are set to 0 V and the voltages of both the source and the drain <b>23</b> <i>a, </i> <b>23</b> <i>b </i>are increased (e.g., Vee=12 V).</p>
    <p>In this case, since the source/drain regions <b>23</b> <i>a, </i> <b>23</b> <i>b </i>oppose to the corresponding floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b, </i>the electrons accumulated in the floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>can be easily exhausted from the source/drain region <b>23</b> <i>a, </i> <b>23</b> <i>b </i>by the Fowler-Nordheim current (F-N current) via the silicon oxide films <b>22</b> with a small film thickness (e.g., about 5 nm) between the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>a </i>or <b>27</b> <i>b </i>and the source/drain region <b>23</b> <i>a </i>or <b>23</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
    <p>In the normal flash memory, the chip erase is employed as the data erase to increase the voltage of the substrate. In the case of the semiconductor memory device of the present invention, since the data erase can be carried out in the source/drain unit that is selected independently with the substrate, not only the chip erase but also one element unit (block unit) erase can be carried out.</p>
    <p>As described above, in the semiconductor memory device driving method as the embodiment of the present invention, two bits per one element are formed by the first and second floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b, </i>and also the 4-value states are set by the combinations of the charge accumulation or no charge accumulation into the first floating gate <b>27</b> <i>a </i>and the charge accumulation or no charge accumulation into the second floating gate <b>27</b> <i>b, </i>and 4-value states can be read by detecting directions of drain currents and magnitudes of the drain currents.</p>
    <p>(3) Semiconductor Memory Device Manufacturing Method</p>
    <p>Next, a semiconductor memory device manufacturing method according to a third embodiment of the present invention will be explained with reference to FIG. 10A to FIG. 10P hereunder.</p>
    <p>FIG. 10A to FIG. 10N correspond to the cross section taken along the II—II line in FIG. 3A, and FIG. <b>10</b>O and FIG. 10P correspond to a set of the cross sections taken along the II—II line and the III—III line in FIG. 3A respectively.</p>
    <p>Here, the semiconductor memory device in which a plurality of transistors are arranged in rows and columns, is fabricated as follows.</p>
    <p>First, as shown in FIG. 10A, the p-type (one conductivity type) silicon layer <b>24</b> whose concentration is lower than the silicon base body <b>21</b> is formed on the p-type silicon base body <b>21</b> by the epitaxial growth, etc.</p>
    <p>Then, a silicon oxide film (lower insulating film) <b>38</b> of about 10 nm thickness is formed by the thermal oxidation, and then a silicon nitride film (oxidation resistant film) <b>32</b> of about 50 nm thickness and a silicon oxide film (upper insulating film) <b>25</b> of about 300 nm thickness are formed by the chemical vapor deposition method (CVD method).</p>
    <p>Then, as shown in FIG. 10B, a resist film is formed on the silicon oxide film <b>25</b>, and then stripe-shaped resist masks (etching resistant masks) <b>26</b> that are arranged in parallel mutually at a distance in the column direction are formed by patterning the resist film. In turn, the silicon oxide film <b>25</b>, the silicon nitride film <b>32</b> and the silicon oxide film <b>38</b> are etched sequentially based on the resist masks <b>26</b> and also the silicon layer <b>24</b> is etched. As a result, stripe-shaped pattern layers that are arranged in parallel at a distance mutually in the column direction are formed, and also the stripe-shaped convex silicon layers (convex semiconductor layers) <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>that are arranged in parallel at a distance mutually in the column direction are formed thereunder. The above structure corresponds to the silicon substrate.</p>
    <p>The stripe-shaped pattern layers consist of the silicon oxide films <b>38</b> <i>a, </i>the silicon nitride films <b>32</b> <i>a, </i>and the silicon oxide films <b>25</b> <i>a, </i>all being subjected to the patterning. The uppermost stripe-shaped silicon oxide films <b>25</b> <i>a </i>are employed as the ion implantation mask. In FIG. 10B, references <b>31</b> denote concave portions formed after the silicon oxide film <b>25</b>, the silicon nitride film <b>32</b>, the silicon oxide film <b>38</b>, and the convex silicon layer <b>24</b> are etched.</p>
    <p>Then, the resist masks <b>26</b> are removed. Then, as shown in FIG. 10C, a silicon oxide film (insulating film) <b>37</b> acting as the ion implantation mask and having a film thickness of 20 to 30 nm is formed on both sides of the convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>by the thermal oxidation. At this time, similarly the silicon oxide film (insulating film) <b>37</b> of 20 to 30 nm thickness is formed on the surface of the silicon base body <b>21</b> exposed between the neighboring convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
    <p>Then, as shown in FIG. 10C, while using the silicon oxide films <b>25</b> <i>a </i>and <b>37</b> on upper surfaces and side surfaces of the convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>as a mask, the n-type (opposite conductivity type) impurity is ion-implanted through the silicon oxide film <b>37</b> on the surface of the silicon base body <b>21</b>. At this time, the ion injection conditions that render the ions to penetrate the silicon oxide film <b>37</b> on the surface of the silicon base body <b>21</b> must be set. On the other hand, since the ion implant direction is substantially perpendicular to the surface of the silicon base body <b>21</b>, the ions do not penetrate the silicon oxide film <b>37</b> on the side surfaces of the convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b. </i>As a result, the first n-type (opposite conductivity type) region (first source/drain region) <b>23</b> <i>a </i>and the second n-type region (second source/drain region) <b>23</b> <i>b, </i>both formed at high concentration and in the stripe-shaped regions that are on the surface of the silicon base body <b>21</b> and extend along the column direction to put the convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>between them, are formed.</p>
    <p>Then, as shown in FIG. 10D, remaining silicon oxide films <b>25</b> <i>a </i>and <b>37</b> are removed. Then, as shown in FIG. 10E, while using the silicon nitride films <b>32</b> <i>a </i>of the stripe-shaped pattern layers as a mask, the silicon oxide films (insulating films) <b>28</b> of about 10 nm thickness are formed on the side surfaces of the convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>and the surface of the silicon base body <b>21</b> exposed between the neighboring convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>by the thermal oxidation.</p>
    <p>Then, as shown in FIG. 10F, the silicon nitride film (oxidation resistant film) <b>33</b> of about 130 nm thickness is formed on the entire surface by the CVD method. Then, as shown in FIG. 10G, sidewall insulating films <b>33</b> <i>a </i>are formed on the side surfaces of the convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>by anisotropic-etching the silicon nitride film <b>33</b>. At this time, the silicon nitride films <b>32</b> <i>a </i>formed originally over the upper surfaces of the convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>may be etched slightly in the etching of the silicon nitride film <b>33</b>, but most of them still remains.</p>
    <p>Then, as shown in FIG. 10H, while using the sidewall insulating films <b>33</b> <i>a </i>and the silicon nitride films <b>32</b> <i>a </i>over the upper surfaces of the convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>as a mask, the silicon base body <b>21</b> between the convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>is thermally oxidized selectively. Accordingly, the stripe-shaped silicon oxide films (thick insulating films) <b>34</b> that have a film thickness of about 50 nm and extend on the middle areas of the stripe-shaped first and second n-type regions <b>23</b> <i>a, </i> <b>23</b> <i>b </i>along the column direction are formed.</p>
    <p>Then, as shown in FIG. 10I, the sidewall insulating films <b>33</b> <i>a </i>and the silicon nitride films <b>32</b> <i>a </i>over the upper surfaces of the convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>are removed. In turn, as shown in FIG. 10J, the silicon oxide films <b>38</b> <i>a, </i> <b>28</b> on the upper surfaces and the side surfaces of the convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>and on the surface of the silicon base body <b>21</b> are removed. At this time, since the film thicknesses of the thick silicon oxide films <b>34</b> are formed thicker than those of the silicon oxide films <b>38</b> <i>a, </i> <b>28</b>, the thick silicon oxide films <b>34</b> are not removed and the most part of them still remains.</p>
    <p>Then, as shown in FIG. 10K, a new silicon oxide film (first insulating film) <b>22</b> acting as the gate insulating film is formed on the upper surfaces and the side surfaces of the exposed convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>and on the surface of the silicon base body <b>21</b> by the thermal oxidation. Then, as shown in FIG. 10L, a polysilicon film (first conductive film) <b>27</b> of about 130 nm thickness is formed on the overall surface by the CVD method.</p>
    <p>Then, as shown in FIG. 10M, conductive sidewalls (first and second conductive sidewalls) <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>made of polysilicon films continuously extending in the column direction are formed on the side surfaces of the stripe-shaped convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>via the silicon oxide film <b>22</b> by etching the polysilicon film <b>27</b> by virtue of anisotropic-etching.</p>
    <p>The film thickness of the silicon nitride film <b>33</b> constituting the sidewall insulating films <b>33</b> <i>a </i>used in the selective oxidation method is set substantially equal to that of the polysilicon film <b>27</b> constituting the conductive sidewalls <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b. </i>Therefore, the first conductive sidewall <b>27</b> <i>a </i>can be formed on the first n-type region <b>23</b> <i>a </i>to extend from the side surface of the convex silicon layer <b>24</b> <i>a </i>on the first n-type region <b>23</b> <i>a </i>side to end portion of the thick insulating film <b>34</b>, whereas the second conductive sidewall <b>27</b> <i>b </i>can be formed on the second n-type region <b>23</b> <i>b </i>to extend from the side surface of the convex silicon layer <b>24</b> <i>a </i>on the second n-type region <b>23</b> <i>b </i>side to end portion of the thick insulating film <b>34</b>. Similarly, the first conductive sidewall <b>27</b> <i>a </i>extending to the end portion of the thick insulating film <b>34</b> and the second conductive sidewall <b>27</b> <i>b </i>extending to the end portion of the thick insulating film <b>34</b> are formed on the side surface of the convex silicon layer <b>24</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
    <p>Then, as shown in FIG. 10N, the silicon oxide films (second insulating films) <b>29</b> of about 8 nm thickness are formed on the surfaces of the conductive sidewalls <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>made of the polysilicon film by the thermal oxidation. The silicon oxide films <b>29</b> on the surfaces of the conductive sidewalls <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>must be formed thinner than the thick silicon oxide films <b>34</b>.</p>
    <p>Then, as shown in FIG. 10O, the conductivity impurities in the source/drain regions <b>23</b> <i>a, </i> <b>23</b> <i>b </i>are activated and diffused into the peripheral portions by the annealing process. Then, the polysilicon film (second conductive film) <b>30</b> of about 250 nm thickness is formed on the overall surface by the CVD method, for example.</p>
    <p>Then, as shown in FIG. 10P, a plurality of stripe-shaped resist masks (etching resistant masks) <b>35</b> are formed in parallel at a distance mutually in the row direction by the photolithography technology. Then, the polysilicon film <b>30</b> is etched based on the resist masks <b>35</b>. Thus, a plurality of stripe-shaped control gates <b>30</b> <i>a, </i> <b>30</b> <i>b </i>which intersect with the stripe-shaped convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>are formed. As the etching conditions, for example, the mixed gas containing Cl<sub>2</sub>+O<sub>2 </sub>is employed, and the gas type and the gas flow rate are selected such that the selective etching ratio of the polysilicon to the silicon oxide film is in excess of <b>30</b>.</p>
    <p>In addition, the p-type impurity is introduced into the convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>based on the above resist masks <b>35</b> by the ion implantation. Therefore, the convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>existing between the control gates <b>30</b> <i>a, </i> <b>30</b> <i>b </i>are formed as the p-type high-concentration impurity layer. As shown in FIG. 2, the convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>under the control gate <b>30</b> <i>a </i>serve as operation layers <b>24</b> <i>t </i>that have the low concentration p-type impurity, while the convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>not covered with the resist masks <b>35</b> serve as element isolation layers <b>24</b> <i>s </i>that have the higher concentration p-type impurity than the operation layers <b>24</b> <i>t. </i>The channel regions of the semiconductor memory elements Tr are formed in respective operation layers <b>24</b> <i>t. </i> </p>
    <p>In turn, as shown in the lower drawing of FIG. 10P, the silicon oxide films <b>29</b> on the conductive sidewalls <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b, </i>which are not covered with the resist masks <b>35</b>, are removed by the etching based on the resist masks <b>35</b>. As the etching conditions, for example, the mixed gas containing C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>+CH<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>+Ar is employed, and the gas type and the gas flow rate are selected such that the selective etching ratio of the silicon oxide film to the silicon is in excess of <b>30</b>. In this case, the insulating films <b>34</b> whose thickness is thicker than the thicknesses of the silicon oxide films <b>29</b> on the surfaces of the conductive sidewalls <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>still remain in the thick insulating film regions on the silicon base body <b>21</b> located between neighboring convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>and between the opposing conductive sidewalls <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b. </i>For this reason, it is possible to prevent the exposure of the silicon base body <b>21</b> located between neighboring convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>and between the opposing conductive sidewalls <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>when the silicon oxide films <b>29</b> on the surfaces of the conductive sidewalls <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>between the neighboring control gates <b>30</b> <i>a, </i> <b>30</b> <i>b </i>are removed.</p>
    <p>Then, as shown in the lower drawing of FIG. 10P, the conductive sidewalls <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b, </i>that are not covered with the control gates <b>30</b> <i>a </i>and are exposed, are removed by the etching based on the same resist masks <b>35</b>. As the etching conditions, for example, the mixed gas containing Cl<sub>2</sub>+O<sub>2 </sub>is employed, and the gas type and the gas flow rate are selected such that the selective etching ratio of the polysilicon to the silicon oxide film is more than 30. As a result, as shown in FIG. 2, the first and second floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>of the semiconductor memory elements Tr are formed under the control gates <b>30</b> <i>a, </i> <b>30</b> <i>b, </i>and also the floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>are separated between the semiconductor memory elements Tr.</p>
    <p>At this time, the convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>exposed between the neighboring control gates <b>30</b> <i>a, </i> <b>30</b> <i>b </i>are also etched. However, since the etching rate of the convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>formed of single-crystal silicon is slow rather than the floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>formed of polysilicon, an amount of etching of the convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>is very small even when all the floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>are removed, and thus most of the convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>still remains. Further, since the silicon base body <b>21</b> in the area between the neighboring control gates is covered with the silicon oxide films <b>34</b>, such silicon base body <b>21</b> is not etched.</p>
    <p>After this, the silicon oxide film <b>36</b> is formed on the entire surface, whereby the semiconductor memory device is completed via the normal steps. FIG. 3B is a sectional view of the semiconductor memory device.</p>
    <p>With the above, the semiconductor memory device manufacturing method is explained by limiting the present invention into the sectional range taken along the II—II line and III—III line in FIG. 3A, but it is needless to say that the present invention may be applied to the full range in which the semiconductor memory device can be formed.</p>
    <p>As described above, in the semiconductor memory device manufacturing method as the embodiment of the present invention, when the conductive sidewalls <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>between the neighboring control gates <b>30</b> <i>a, </i> <b>30</b> <i>b </i>are separated, the silicon base body <b>21</b> between the conductive sidewalls <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>can be prevented by the thick silicon oxide films <b>34</b> from being etched. As a result, unevenness of the surface is reduced. Accordingly, it is possible to suppress the possibility that so-called film disconnection, etc. occurs when the film is formed thereon, etc., the possibility that the defects are introduced by etching the silicon base body <b>21</b>, etc.</p>
    <p>In the above second embodiment, in the step in FIG. 10N, the silicon oxide films <b>29</b> formed by the thermal oxidation are employed as the insulating film for covering the conductive sidewalls <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b. </i>A triple-layered insulating film as the so-called ONO film, which is obtained by laminating sequentially the silicon oxide film, the silicon nitride film, and the silicon oxide film may be employed. In this case, a total film thickness of the triple-layered insulating film may be set appropriately smaller than the film thicknesses of the thick insulating films <b>34</b>, and also may be set substantially identically to the film thicknesses of the single-layered silicon oxide films <b>29</b>. The triple-layered insulating film obtained as the ONO film can be formed on the conductive sidewalls <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>by forming the lowest silicon oxide film of the triple-layered insulating film on partial areas by the thermal oxidizing method and then forming upper two insulating films on the overall surface by the CVD method. Because at least two layers of the triple-layered insulating film as the ONO film are formed on the overall surface, the film thickness of the insulating film interposed between the convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>and the control gates <b>30</b> <i>a, </i> <b>30</b> <i>b </i>is increased, but no problem has come up.</p>
    <p>Also, in the steps in FIG. 10P, when the conductive side walls <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>between the neighboring control gates <b>30</b> <i>a, </i> <b>30</b> <i>b </i>are removed, the convex silicon layer <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>are almost remained. However, the convex silicon layer <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>between the neighboring control gates <b>30</b> <i>a, </i> <b>30</b> <i>b </i>may be removed by excessive etching to separate the convex silicon layer <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>in addition to the floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
    <p>In this case, a plurality of island-like convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>t </i>that are separated mutually are arranged regularly in rows and columns. The silicon oxide films <b>22</b> formed on the side surfaces of the convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>are left after the convex silicon layers <b>24</b> <i>a, </i> <b>24</b> <i>b </i>are removed, but such silicon oxide films <b>22</b> may be removed by the slight etching. The semiconductor memory device fabricated in this manner are shown in FIG. 11A of plan view and FIG. 11B of sectional view taken along IV—IV line of FIG. <b>11</b>A. In FIG. <b>11</b>A and FIG. 11B, since the same references as those in FIG. <b>3</b>A and FIG. 3B denote the same constituent elements as those in FIG. <b>3</b>A and FIG. 3B, their explanations will be omitted.</p>
    <p>As described above, the present invention is explained in detail with reference to the embodiments, but the scope of the present invention is not limited to the examples shown particularly in the above embodiments. Variations of the above embodiments not to depart from the gist of the present invention may be contained in the scope of the present invention.</p>
    <p>For example, in the above embodiments, the polysilicon is employed as the material of the floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>and the control gates <b>30</b> <i>a, </i> <b>30</b> <i>b, </i>. . . But other conductive material may be employed.</p>
    <p>Also, in the above embodiments, as shown in FIG. 3A, the overall bottom surfaces of the floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>are arranged on the corresponding source/drain regions <b>23</b> <i>a, </i> <b>23</b> <i>b </i>respectively. But the case where a part of the bottom surfaces of the floating gates <b>27</b> <i>a, </i> <b>27</b> <i>b </i>are arranged on the source/drain regions <b>23</b> <i>a, </i> <b>23</b> <i>b </i>respectively may be contained as shown in FIG. 12 in which only the floating gate <b>27</b> <i>b </i>on the source/drain region <b>23</b> <i>b </i>is shown.</p>
