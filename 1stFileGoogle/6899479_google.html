<heading>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading> <p num="p-0002">The present application is based on Japanese Priority Document JP-2002-267213 filed on Sep. 12, 2002 the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
  <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
  <p num="p-0004">The present invention relates to a printer stored in a casing to print on paper and cut the paper after its printing, and a commodity information processing apparatus equipped with the printer.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">2. Discussion of the Background</p>
  <p num="p-0006">Conventionally, there has been adopted a printer in which a roll of paper as is used as a medium to be printed, and, after printing, the paper is cut off at an arbitrary position.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">As an example of such a printer, there is a receipt printer which is incorporated in a commodity information processing apparatus such as a POS (Point Of Sales) terminal and an ECR (Electric Cash Register) and the like, and the printer issues a receipt on which specific data of transaction are printed to make clear details of the transaction by the sales-register processing.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">The receipt is issued in accordance with details of transaction. Generally, therefore, the receipt differs in length every time it is issued. In the receipt printer, therefore, the paper is cut by a cutter section as required after printing of specific data, thereby enabling the use of a required length of paper without waste.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">The conventional receipt printer stated above will be explained by referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13. A</figref> receipt printer <b>100</b> is of such a construction that, on a frame <b>108</b>, are mounted a paper housing section <b>101</b> for housing and holding paper, a printing section <b>104</b> having a platen <b>102</b> which is driven to rotate and a printhead <b>103</b> located oppositely to the platen <b>102</b>, and a rotary cutter <b>107</b> which is a cutting section having a stationary blade <b>105</b> and a movable blade <b>106</b> disposed oppositely to the stationary blade <b>105</b> and driven to rotate while sliding its cutting edge section in relation to that of the stationary blade <b>105</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">The frame <b>108</b> is constructed such that a turning frame <b>110</b> is rotatably connected with respect to a main body frame <b>109</b> by a support shaft <b>111</b> arranged at the rear end of the printer.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">Then, the receipt printer <b>100</b> is housed in the casing of the commodity information processing apparatus and used.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">In the receipt printer <b>100</b> stated above, when printing is performed, first an opening/closing cover arranged at the casing of the commodity information processing apparatus is opened. Subsequently, the turning frame <b>110</b> is turned in a direction in which the turing frame <b>110</b> moves away from the main body frame <b>109</b>, whereby the frame <b>108</b> is made open. Subsequently, a platen <b>102</b> is moved away from the printhead <b>103</b>, and the stationary blade <b>105</b> is moved away from the fixed blade <b>106</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">In this state, the paper <b>112</b> is housed in the paper housing section <b>101</b>, the paper <b>112</b> is drawn out to pass over the main body frame <b>109</b>, and in this state the turning frame <b>110</b> is turned in a direction in which it approaches to the main body frame <b>109</b>. Then, the frame <b>108</b> is closed to cause the paper to be held between the platen <b>102</b> and the printhead <b>103</b> and between the stationary blade <b>105</b> and the movable blade <b>106</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">After this state, the opening/closing cover arranged at the casing of the commodity information processing apparatus is closed. Then, a setting of the paper <b>112</b> to the receipt printer <b>100</b> is carried out.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">In this way, the platen <b>102</b> is rotated and driven under a state in which the paper <b>112</b> is set, the paper <b>112</b> held by the paper housing section <b>101</b> is drawn out and transferred, some specific data are printed on the paper <b>112</b> by the printhead <b>103</b> during its transferring stage and the paper <b>112</b> after printed is cut by a rotary cutter <b>107</b>, whereby a receipt is issued.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">In this case, when the cutting operation of the rotary cutter <b>107</b> is carried out, a force in a direction moving away from the main body frame <b>109</b> may act on the turning frame <b>110</b>. Although not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the receipt printer <b>100</b> is provided with a turning operation restricting structure (not shown) for restricting a turning of the turning frame <b>110</b> under influence of this force.</p>
  <p num="p-0017">In this receipt printer <b>100</b>, the turning frame <b>110</b> is turned with respect to the main body frame <b>109</b> to enable the platen <b>102</b> and the printhead <b>103</b> to be moved away from each other and the stationary blade <b>105</b> and the movable blade <b>106</b> to be moved away from each other, so that a setting of the paper <b>12</b> and clearing of jam of the paper <b>112</b> between the platen <b>102</b> and the printhead <b>103</b> and between the stationary blade <b>105</b> and the movable blade <b>106</b> can be easily carried out.</p>
  <p num="p-0018">However, in the case of such a receipt printer <b>100</b> as described above, the turning frame <b>110</b> having such a size ranging from the support shaft <b>111</b> installed at the rear end of the receipt printer <b>100</b> to the rotary cutter <b>107</b> arranged at the front end of the receipt printer <b>100</b> must be installed, whereby a weight of the receipt printer <b>100</b> is increased.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0019">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to make a lightweight structure for use in dividing the printing section and a cutter section.</p>
  <p num="p-0020">The objects of the present invention are achieved by the novel printer and the commodity information processing apparatus of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0021">According to the novel printer and the commodity information processing apparatus of the present invention, a printing section has a platen and a printhead located oppositely on both sides of the guide path; in the printing section, a cutter section has a stationary blade and a movable blade located oppositely on both sides of the guide path and cuts paper printed at the printing section by engaging the movable blade with the stationary blade. A first unit is located on one side of the guide path arranged inside the casing which can be separated into a first casing member and a second casing member, holding either one of the stationary blade and the movable blade in the cutter section; and a second unit located on the other side of the guide path has either one of the other platen and the other printhead and either one of the other stationary blade and the other movable blade. Under a state in which the casing is closed, the printhead and the platen are oppositely arranged and the stationary blade and the movable blade are positioned at a location where the paper can be cut, and under a state in which the casing is opened, the second unit is directly mounted to a second casing member in such a way that the printhead and the platen are arranged away from each other and the stationary blade and the movable blade are arranged away from each other.</p>

The opening/closing cover <b>16</b> is provided with the aforesaid receipt issuing port <b>8</b> and the journal window <b>9</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0042">Next, a structure of the receipt printer <b>7</b> will be described. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a support frame <b>17</b>, a paper-storing section <b>18</b>, a paper guide <b>19</b>, a printing section <b>20</b> and a cutter section <b>21</b> constitute the receipt printer <b>7</b>. The paper-storing section <b>18</b> is set at the support frame <b>17</b>. The receipt printer <b>7</b> is formed with a paper transfer path <b>22</b> acting as guide path starting from the paper-storing section <b>18</b> to the cutter section <b>21</b> through the printing section <b>20</b>. The paper-storing section <b>18</b> is formed into an arcuate shape and stores and holds a rolled wound elongated paper <b>23</b>. The paper guide <b>19</b> is formed between the front end of the paper-storing section <b>18</b> and the printing section <b>20</b> so as to support a surface of the paper <b>23</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0043">The printing section <b>20</b> is constituted by a platen <b>24</b> and a thermal head <b>25</b> acting as a print head oppositely facing to this platen <b>24</b>. The platen <b>24</b> is constituted by a paper support <b>26</b> supporting a rear surface of the paper <b>23</b> and a support shaft <b>27</b> formed to extend from both ends of the paper support <b>26</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0044">In this case, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a left side view showing a receipt printer <b>7</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a gear <b>28</b> is fixed to the support shaft <b>27</b> at one end of the platen <b>24</b>, and the platen <b>24</b> is connected to a motor not shown through the gear <b>28</b> and a gear train <b>29</b> engaged with the gear <b>28</b>. A driving force applied from the motor transmitted through the gear <b>28</b> and the gear train <b>29</b> rotatably drives the platen <b>24</b>. In the present embodiment, the gear <b>28</b> and the gear train <b>29</b> realize a driving force transmitting mechanism, and the motor realizes a driving source.</p>
  <p num="p-0045">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the thermal head <b>25</b> is mounted to a head holding member <b>30</b> of flat-plate shape. This head holding member <b>30</b> is rotatably arranged in such a direction as one in which it is moved to or away from the platen <b>24</b> around a fulcrum <b>31</b>, and urged to the platen <b>24</b> by a coil spring <b>32</b> arranged between the head holding member and a hook member <b>70</b> described later and acting as a compression spring. With this arrangement, the thermal head <b>25</b> abuts against the platen <b>24</b>. Then, at the printing section <b>20</b>, the thermal head <b>25</b> carries out a printing on the paper <b>23</b> placed between the platen <b>24</b> and the thermal head <b>25</b>. In addition, the platen <b>24</b> is rotated and driven by the motor to cause the paper <b>23</b> to be transferred along the paper-carrying path <b>22</b>. In this case, the printing section <b>20</b> may also act as a carrying section for carrying the paper <b>23</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0046">The cutter section <b>21</b> has an assembly of a stationary blade <b>33</b>, and a movable blade <b>34</b> either having a shape of approximately flat plate. These blades <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> are of a separated type, being kept open when not cutting. The stationary blade <b>33</b> and the movable blade <b>34</b> are so positioned as to engage with each other like scissors when the movable blade <b>34</b> is rotating. That is, the cutter section <b>21</b> of the present embodiment is a rotary cutter so constructed as to cut the paper <b>23</b> that is carried along the paper-carrying path <b>22</b>, by engaging the stationary blade <b>33</b> with the movable blade <b>34</b> like a pair of scissors. A stepping motor (not shown) acting as a driving source drives the movable blade <b>34</b> of the cutter section <b>21</b> thus constructed. The stepping motor is started to operate in accordance with a start signal.</p>
  <p num="p-0047"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a right side view showing the receipt printer. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a cutter arm <b>36</b> that rocks on the center of a fulcrum <b>35</b> is connected to the movable blade <b>34</b>. A driving force of the stepping motor stated above is transmitted to the cutter arm <b>36</b> via a plate cam <b>38</b> connected through a gear train <b>37</b>. In the present embodiment, the driving force of the stepping motor is transmitted to the movable blade <b>34</b> through the cutter arm <b>36</b>, the gear train <b>37</b> and the plate cam <b>38</b> as power transmission media, thereby driving to rotate the movable blade <b>34</b>. Here the cutter arm <b>36</b> functions as a follower in a cam mechanism in which the plate cam <b>38</b> functions as a driver. In the present embodiment, when the cutter arm <b>36</b> rocks by a predetermined amount from a predetermined position, the movable blade <b>34</b> mounted on a rotating shaft <b>39</b> which is a movable blade holding section and is secured on the center of rotation thereof is rotated from a non-cutting position to a cutting position. Thus the paper <b>23</b> is cut by the stationary blade <b>33</b> and the movable blade <b>34</b> which are engaged like scissors.</p>
  <p num="p-0048"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a perspective view showing the movable blade and the rotating shaft. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a plan view showing the rotating shaft mounted with the movable blade. The movable blade <b>34</b> is removably mounted on the rotating shaft <b>39</b> as shown in FIG. <b>6</b>. The rotating shaft <b>39</b> is produced of an elastic resin, and formed in a shape of rod. Furthermore, the rotating shaft <b>39</b> is positioned in a direction in which its axis will be in parallel with the axis of the platen <b>24</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0049">On both end portions of the rotating shaft <b>39</b>, support portions <b>40</b> <i>a </i>and <b>40</b> <i>b </i>rotatably mounted on the lower unit frame <b>47</b> are formed. Between these two support portions <b>40</b> <i>a </i>and <b>40</b> <i>b</i>, a movable blade holding section <b>41</b> removably holding the movable blade <b>34</b> is formed. More specifically, the movable blade holding section <b>41</b> is formed to cut out stock between the support sections <b>40</b> <i>a </i>and <b>40</b> <i>b </i>in such a manner that the rotating shaft <b>39</b> will have a semi-circular cross section. Between the support sections <b>40</b> <i>a </i>and <b>40</b> <i>b</i>, a flat surface <b>42</b> is formed on the movable blade holding section <b>41</b>. The flat surface <b>42</b> is inclined in relation to the direction of the axis of the rotating shaft <b>39</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0050">Formed at both ends of the flat surface <b>42</b> inside the support sections <b>40</b> <i>a </i>and <b>40</b> <i>b </i>are grooves <b>43</b> <i>a </i>and <b>43</b> <i>b </i>in which both ends of the movable blade <b>34</b> can be slidably fitted. Therefore, the movable blade <b>34</b> fitted in the grooves <b>43</b> <i>a </i>and <b>43</b> <i>b </i>is inclined in relation to the direction of the axis of the rotating shaft <b>39</b> along the flat surface <b>42</b>. In both ends of the lower edge portion of the flat surface <b>42</b>, a positioning portion <b>44</b> is formed to support in position the lower edge of the movable blade <b>34</b> inserted in the grooves <b>43</b> <i>a </i>and <b>43</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0051">In the base section <b>34</b> <i>b </i>of the movable blade <b>34</b>, two holes <b>45</b> <i>a </i>and <b>45</b> <i>b </i>are formed. On the flat surface <b>42</b> of the rotating shaft <b>39</b>, two projections <b>46</b> <i>a </i>and <b>46</b> <i>b </i>are formed to fit in the holes <b>45</b> <i>a </i>and <b>45</b> <i>b</i>. The movable blade <b>34</b> is installed in such a manner that an edge portion <b>34</b> <i>a </i>may protrude out of the outer peripheral surface of the rotating shaft <b>39</b>, and that the bottom end (the opposite side of the edge portion <b>34</b> <i>a</i>) of the base section <b>34</b> <i>b </i>may be in the same position as that of the outer peripheral surface of the rotating shaft <b>39</b>. The rotating shaft <b>39</b>, therefore, can be reinforced by the movable blade <b>39</b>, thereby maintaining the strength of whole body of the rotating shaft <b>39</b> even if the rotating shaft <b>39</b> is cut out into a semi-circular cross sectional form.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">To mount the movable blade <b>34</b> to the movable blade holding section <b>41</b>, the bottom end on the opposite side of the edge portion <b>34</b> <i>a </i>of the movable blade <b>34</b> is inserted into the grooves <b>43</b> <i>a </i>and <b>43</b> <i>b</i>. The rotating shaft <b>39</b>, having resilience, deflects to allow the projections <b>46</b> <i>a </i>and <b>46</b> <i>b </i>to fit in the holes <b>45</b> <i>a </i>and <b>45</b> <i>b</i>. In this state, the movable blade <b>34</b> thus fitted in the grooves <b>43</b> <i>a </i>and <b>43</b> <i>b </i>is sandwiched between the grooves <b>43</b> <i>a </i>and <b>43</b> <i>b </i>that have resilience. Thus fitting the projections <b>46</b> <i>a </i>and <b>46</b> <i>b </i>in the holes <b>45</b> <i>a </i>and <b>45</b> <i>b </i>can restrict the movement of the movable blade <b>34</b>, holding the movable blade <b>34</b> on the rotating shaft <b>39</b>. When removing the movable blade <b>34</b> from the rotating shaft <b>39</b>, the movable blade <b>34</b> is pulled out of the grooves <b>43</b> <i>a </i>and <b>43</b> <i>b</i>, to thereby deflect the rotating shaft <b>39</b> to release the projections <b>46</b> <i>a </i>and <b>46</b> <i>b </i>from the holes <b>45</b> <i>a </i>and <b>45</b> <i>b</i>. It is, therefore, possible to remove the movable blade <b>34</b> from the grooves <b>43</b> <i>a </i>and <b>43</b> <i>b </i>of the rotating shaft <b>39</b>.</p>

The upper wall <b>53</b> of the upper unit frame <b>51</b> is formed with two holes <b>54</b>. The inner surface <b>55</b> of the opening/closing cover <b>16</b> is formed with two support shafts <b>57</b> having a flat-plate like support section <b>56</b> at their ends. A diameter of the support shaft <b>57</b> is set to be smaller than that of the hole <b>54</b> of the upper unit frame <b>51</b>.

  <p num="p-0058">In addition, the upper unit <b>52</b> is removably fitted to the lower unit <b>48</b> by a connecting mechanism <b>58</b>. The connecting mechanism <b>58</b> is constituted by a connecting shaft <b>59</b> and the platen <b>24</b> fixed to the lower unit frame <b>51</b> of the upper unit <b>52</b>; a groove <b>60</b> formed at the lower unit frame <b>47</b> of the lower unit <b>48</b> and acting as a first support section to which the connecting shaft <b>59</b> can be fitted; and a groove <b>61</b> formed at the lower unit frame <b>47</b> of the lower unit <b>48</b> and acting as a second support section to which both ends of the platen <b>24</b> can be fitted.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">The connecting shaft <b>59</b> is located to the upstream side of the platen <b>24</b> in the direction in which the paper is carried. An axial direction of the connecting shaft <b>59</b> is in parallel with an axial direction of the platen <b>24</b> that corresponds to a paper width direction.</p>
  <p num="p-0060">The groove <b>60</b> is formed in a pair of inside walls <b>63</b> <i>a </i>and <b>63</b> <i>b </i>formed vertically inside of both sidewalls <b>62</b> <i>a </i>and <b>62</b> <i>b </i>of the lower unit frame <b>47</b>.

In this state, the upper unit <b>52</b> is secured to the lower unit <b>48</b> to thereby restrict the movement of the upper unit <b>52</b> in relation to the lower unit <b>48</b>. The support shaft <b>27</b> of the platen <b>24</b> functions also as a connecting shaft together with the connecting shaft <b>59</b>. In the state of connection, the platen <b>24</b> and the thermal head <b>25</b> are oppositely positioned, and the gear <b>28</b> mounted on the platen <b>24</b> meshes with the gear train <b>29</b> as shown in FIG. <b>4</b>. The movable blade <b>34</b> and the stationary blade <b>33</b> are positioned at a location in which the paper <b>23</b> can be cut.</p>
  <p num="p-0062">In the upper unit frame <b>51</b>, a connecting shaft <b>65</b> is disposed. On the lower unit frame <b>47</b>, a vertical wall <b>66</b> is formed. The connecting shaft <b>65</b> and the vertical wall <b>66</b> are so constructed as to contact with each other when the upper unit <b>52</b> and the lower unit <b>48</b> are connected. To give a more detailed description, the axis of the connecting shaft <b>65</b> is in parallel with the axis of the platen <b>24</b>, so that the connecting shaft <b>65</b> extends sideward from the outer surface of one sidewall <b>64</b> <i>a </i>of the upper unit frame <b>51</b>.

  <p num="p-0065"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a longitudinal left side view showing the mounting construction of the thermal head <b>10</b> and the hook member. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a pair of hook members <b>70</b> are installed on the lower unit <b>48</b>. Formed on either of the hook members <b>70</b> is a hook portion <b>69</b>, which can be engaged with, and disengaged from, both support shafts <b>27</b> of the platen <b>24</b> fitted in the groove <b>61</b>. The hook member <b>70</b> is composed of the hook portion <b>69</b> and a flat plate portion <b>71</b> formed in a shape of flat plate unitarily with the hook portion <b>69</b>. The hook member <b>70</b> is rotatable about the fulcrum <b>31</b> in a direction in which the hook portion <b>69</b> is engaged with, and disengaged from, both support shafts <b>27</b> of the platen <b>24</b>. The hook member <b>70</b> is being pressed toward engagement with both support shafts <b>27</b> of the platen <b>24</b> (in the direction of arrow A in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) by the coil spring <b>32</b> arranged between the hook member <b>70</b> and the head holding member <b>30</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0066">On the hook portion <b>69</b>, an inclined portion <b>69</b> <i>a </i>and an inclined portion <b>69</b> <i>b </i>are formed. The inclined portion <b>69</b> <i>a </i>is inclined to allow the rotation of the hook member <b>70</b> to thereby prevent interference with both support shafts <b>27</b> while abutting against both support shafts <b>27</b> of the platen <b>24</b> when the upper unit <b>52</b> is installed to the lower unit <b>48</b>. The inclined portion <b>69</b> <i>b </i>is inclined to allow the rotation of the hook member <b>70</b> to thereby prevent interference with both support shafts <b>27</b> while abutting against both support shafts <b>27</b> of the platen <b>24</b> when removing the upper unit <b>52</b> from the lower unit <b>48</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0067">When the upper unit <b>52</b> is connected to the lower unit <b>48</b>, rotating the hook member <b>70</b> against the urging force of the coil spring <b>32</b> as the upper unit <b>52</b> approaches the lower unit <b>48</b> prevents the interference of the hook member <b>70</b> with both support shafts <b>27</b> of the platen <b>24</b>. Finally, however, the hook portion <b>69</b> is moved to engage with both support shafts <b>27</b> of the platen <b>24</b> by the biasing force of the coil spring <b>32</b>, thus locking the upward movement of the upper unit <b>52</b> in relation to the lower unit <b>48</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0068">When the upper unit <b>52</b> is removed from the lower unit <b>48</b>, the interference of the hook member <b>70</b> with both support shafts <b>27</b> of the platen <b>24</b> is prevented by rotating the hook member <b>70</b> against the biasing force of the coil spring <b>32</b> as the upper unit <b>52</b> moves away from the lower unit <b>48</b>. Finally, the hook member <b>49</b> is released in its engagement from both support shafts <b>27</b> of the platen <b>24</b> and the hook portion <b>69</b>, whereby the upper unit <b>52</b> can be removed from the lower unit <b>48</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0069">In the state that the upper unit <b>52</b> is not connected to the lower unit <b>48</b>, the hook member <b>70</b> being pressed by the coil spring <b>32</b> and the head holding member <b>30</b> are positioned in contact with each of the positioning surfaces <b>72</b> and <b>73</b> formed on the lower unit frame <b>47</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0070">In the state that the upper unit <b>52</b> and the lower unit <b>48</b> are connected, the connecting shaft <b>59</b> is positioned adjacently to the paper guide <b>19</b>, supporting the paper <b>23</b> on the backside. In the receipt printer <b>7</b> of the ECR <b>1</b> of the present embodiment, a paper smoothing section <b>74</b> comprises the aforementioned connecting shaft <b>59</b> and the paper guide <b>19</b> as shown in FIG. <b>2</b>. In the paper smoothing section <b>74</b>, the roll of paper <b>23</b> being fed out is sandwiched from above and below between the connecting shaft <b>59</b> and the paper guide <b>19</b>, thus being smoothed. Here, the paper <b>23</b> wound in a form of roll tends to curl in the vicinity of the trailing end thereof due to a curling tendency, but can be straightened by passing through the paper smoothing section <b>74</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0071">Additionally, the ECR <b>1</b> is provided with a control section not shown for controlling in driving of each of the segments in it. With such an arrangement as above, it becomes possible to control driving of each of the segments of the ECR <b>1</b> and each of the segments of the receipt printer <b>7</b>. This control section is provided with a PLU (Price Look Up) file having a commodity name or a unit price set for every commodity code. When the commodity code assigned to the commodity is inputted through a bar-code scanner <b>12</b> or the keyboard <b>5</b>, the control section refers to the PLU file, displays the commodity data based on the inputted commodity code on the displays <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> or calculates a total price of all the commodities having the commodity codes inputted therein or displays the calculated total price on the displays <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>. In addition, the control section performs an end processing in response to an end operation after the money is given or taken on the basis of the calculated total price. In the present embodiment, the control section performs various kinds of processing on information on the basis of the commodity code. Accordingly, the control section in the present embodiment realizes the commodity information processing.</p>
  <p num="p-0072">In such a configuration as above, the receipt printer <b>7</b> prints and issues a receipt when information about the commodity is processed. Further, a printing operation performed by the receipt printer <b>7</b> is a well-known technology, so that its description will be eliminated.</p>
  <p num="p-0073">When the paper <b>23</b> is set at the receipt printer <b>7</b>, at first, the opening/closing cover <b>16</b> is opened. With this operation, the upper unit <b>52</b> is moved upward along with the opening/closing cover <b>16</b>. As the upper unit <b>52</b> is moved upward, a locked state of the platen <b>24</b> with the hook member <b>70</b>, i.e. the connected state of the connecting mechanism <b>58</b> is released. As the opening/closing cover <b>16</b> is released, the upper unit <b>52</b> having the connected state of the connecting mechanism <b>58</b> released is removed from the lower unit <b>48</b>. Through this operation, the platen <b>24</b> and the thermal head <b>25</b> are moved away from each other, and also the stationary blade <b>33</b> and the movable blade <b>34</b> are moved away from each other.</p>
  <p num="p-0074">Under this state, the paper <b>23</b> is stored in the paper storing section <b>18</b> and the paper <b>23</b> is pulled out to pass over the main body frame <b>47</b> to cause its extremity end to be located at a downstream side in a paper transferring direction rather than the movable blade <b>34</b>, and then the opening/closing cover <b>16</b> is closed. Through this operation, the upper unit <b>52</b> is moved to approach the lower unit <b>48</b>, the connecting shaft <b>65</b> abuts against the vertical wall <b>66</b> during its motion, the hook member <b>70</b> is engaged with the support shaft <b>27</b> of the platen <b>24</b> and the upper unit <b>52</b> is connected to the lower unit <b>48</b>. In this way, the upper unit <b>52</b> and the lower unit <b>48</b> are connected to each other to cause the paper <b>23</b> to be passed between the connecting shaft <b>59</b> and the paper guide <b>19</b>, between the thermal head <b>25</b> and the platen <b>24</b> and between the stationary blade <b>33</b> and the movable blade <b>34</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0075">As described above, a setting of the paper <b>23</b> to the receipt printer <b>7</b> can be easily carried out in the present embodiment because opening of the opening/closing cover <b>16</b> causes the printing section <b>20</b> to be separated from the cutter section <b>21</b> and closing of the opening/closing cover <b>16</b> under a state in which the paper <b>23</b> is passed between the upper unit <b>52</b> and the lower unit <b>48</b> enables the paper <b>23</b> to be held between the printing section <b>20</b> and the cutter section <b>21</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0076">In addition, a turning frame as found in the prior art receipt printer shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> for use in separating the printing section <b>20</b> or the cutter section <b>21</b> is not needed in the present embodiment, so that a weight of a structure for separating the printing section <b>20</b> or the cutter section <b>21</b> can be made light.</p>
  <p num="p-0077">As described above, the printing operation is a well-known technology and its description is eliminated here. However, when printing, the receipt printer <b>7</b> applies a transferring drive force of the platen <b>24</b> to the paper <b>23</b> stored and held at the paper storing section <b>18</b>. Then, some predetermined receipt printing contents are printed in sequence by the thermal head <b>25</b> when the paper <b>23</b> being transferred in the paper-carrying path <b>22</b>. Upon completion of printing operation, the movable blade <b>34</b> is driven in compliance with timing where the rear end in the receipt area already printed passes through the cutter section <b>21</b> to cut the paper <b>23</b>. Then, the cut paper <b>23</b> is issued as a receipt.</p>
  <p num="p-0078">Thereafter, as a remaining part of the rolled paper <b>23</b> decreases with the issue of receipts, the rolled portion of the paper <b>23</b> becomes lightweight, and an increased curling tendency appears. In such a case, the paper <b>23</b> is likely to move up in the paper holding section <b>18</b> to thereby become level and flat on the whole, being fed out in this state. In the present embodiment, however, because of the provision of the paper smoothing section <b>74</b>, the paper smoothing section <b>74</b> smooths the paper <b>23</b>. In the smoothed state, the paper <b>23</b> can be fed into the printing section <b>20</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0079">In case of jamming of the paper <b>23</b> at the paper smoothing section <b>74</b>, or at the printing section <b>20</b>, or at the cutter section <b>21</b>, the upper unit <b>52</b> is removed from the lower unit <b>48</b> by the same procedure as in the above-described setting of the paper <b>23</b>. In this state, the space between the connecting shaft <b>59</b> and the paper guide <b>19</b>, the space between the thermal head <b>25</b> and the platen <b>24</b>, and the space between the stationary blade <b>33</b> and the movable blade <b>34</b> are opened, to thereby enable easy clearance of jams of the paper <b>23</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0080">In the present embodiment, the provision of the platen <b>24</b> and the stationary blade <b>33</b> on the upper unit <b>52</b> and the provision of the thermal head <b>25</b> and the movable blade <b>34</b> on the lower unit <b>48</b> have been explained as an example.

  <p num="p-0083">In addition, in the present embodiment, there is provided the connecting mechanism <b>58</b> for position setting the upper unit <b>52</b> and the lower unit <b>48</b> so as to cause the thermal head <b>25</b> and the platen <b>24</b> to be oppositely faced to each other under a closed state of the casing <b>4</b> and further to enable the upper unit <b>52</b> and the lower unit <b>48</b> to be position set to cause the stationary blade <b>33</b> and the movable blade <b>34</b> to be located at a position where the paper <b>23</b> can be cut, so that it is possible to perform a positive position setting of the upper unit <b>52</b> and the lower unit <b>48</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0084">In the present embodiment, the connecting mechanism <b>58</b> can be constructed by a simple configuration because both a position setting and a fixing of the lower unit <b>48</b> to the upper unit <b>52</b> are carried out through fitting of a plurality of connecting shafts <b>27</b>, <b>59</b>, <b>65</b> with a direction crossing at a right angle to the paper carrying direction being applied as an axial direction at any one of the upper unit <b>52</b> and the lower unit <b>48</b>, and a plurality of supporting sections <b>60</b>, <b>61</b>, <b>66</b> arranged at the other of the upper unit <b>52</b> and the lower unit <b>48</b>, whereby mere opening or closing motion of the opening/closing cover <b>16</b> enables the upper unit <b>52</b> to be easily engaged to or disengaged from the lower unit <b>48</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0085">In the present embodiment, even if a fixing position of the opening/closing cover <b>16</b> to the case <b>14</b> is displaced due to disturbance in manufacturing work or aging, for example, the position of the upper unit <b>52</b> in respect to the lower unit <b>48</b> can be adjusted under utilization of its clearance and the engagement or disengagement of the upper unit <b>52</b> in respect to the lower unit <b>48</b> can be carried out through opening or closing operation of the opening/closing cover <b>16</b> because the upper unit <b>52</b> is not directly connected to the opening/closing cover <b>16</b>, but is fixed with a clearance to the opening/closing cover <b>16</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0086">In the present embodiment, the platen <b>24</b> has the paper support section <b>26</b> supporting the paper <b>23</b> and the support shaft <b>27</b> extended from both ends of the paper support section <b>26</b>. The support shaft <b>27</b> serves as one of the connecting shafts to enable the cost of the receipt printer to be reduced.</p>
  <p num="p-0087">In the present embodiment, the paper guide <b>19</b> is provided in either the lower unit <b>48</b> or the upper unit <b>52</b>, on the more upstream side than the platen <b>24</b> in the direction of travel of the paper, to support one side of the paper <b>23</b>. One of the connecting shafts is arranged at any one of the lower unit <b>48</b> and the upper unit <b>52</b> with a direction crossing at a right angle to the paper feeding direction being applied as an axial direction, the other surface of the paper <b>23</b> is supported under a state in which the lower unit <b>48</b> and the upper unit <b>52</b> are connected by the connecting mechanism <b>58</b> and it is oppositely faced to the paper guide <b>19</b> in such a manner that the paper <b>23</b> can be held between it and the paper guide <b>19</b>, so that even if the pulling-out portion of the paper is in a roll form due to its curling, it can be smoothed and the paper <b>23</b> being smoothed can be transferred to the printing section <b>20</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0088">In the present embodiment, the lower unit <b>48</b> having the movable blade <b>34</b> includes the movable blade holding section <b>41</b> for holding the movable blade <b>34</b>. The movable blade <b>34</b> can be engaged with or disengaged from the movable blade holding section <b>41</b>, so that when the movable blade <b>34</b> has completed its life time, the movable blade <b>34</b> is removed from the rotating shaft <b>39</b> to enable only the movable blade <b>34</b> to be easily replaced with a new one.</p>
  <p num="p-0089">In the present embodiment, there are provided a driving source arranged at the case <b>14</b> and for generating a driving force to the platen <b>24</b>, the thermal head <b>25</b> and the movable blade <b>34</b>, and a driving force transmission mechanism arranged at the case <b>14</b> and for transmitting a driving force generated by the driving source to the platen <b>24</b>, the thermal head <b>25</b> and the movable blade <b>34</b>, so that it is possible to make a light weight driving section and a simple circuit wiring for it as compared with a case where the driving source or the driving force transmitting mechanism is arranged to the opening/closing cover.</p>
  <p num="p-0090">Meanwhile, when the cutting operation of the cutter section <b>21</b> is to be performed, the movable blade <b>34</b> rotated and driven pushes the stationary blade <b>33</b>. At this time, if it is assumed that the connecting shaft constituting the connecting mechanism <b>58</b> is either the connecting shaft <b>59</b> or the platen <b>24</b>, it might be considered that a rotational momentum may act on the upper unit <b>52</b> around the platen <b>24</b> to cause the upper unit <b>52</b> to be turned in respect to the lower unit <b>48</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0091">On the contrary, in the present embodiment, even if the rotational momentum is generated around the connecting shaft <b>59</b> or the platen <b>24</b>, the upper unit <b>52</b> is fixed against the lower unit <b>48</b> and a turning of the upper unit <b>52</b> in respect to the lower unit <b>48</b> is restricted because the connecting shaft is composed of two shafts of the connecting shaft <b>59</b> and the platen <b>24</b>. Accordingly, the upper unit <b>52</b> is not rotated by this rotational momentum.</p>
  <p num="p-0092">In addition, in the present embodiment, the rotation of the upper unit <b>52</b> caused by the rotational momentum acted on the upper unit <b>52</b> can be effectively restricted when a cutting operation is carried out at the cutter section <b>21</b> in the receipt printer <b>7</b> having a higher height size in the present embodiment because the connecting mechanism constituted by the connecting shaft <b>65</b> and the vertical wall <b>66</b> is installed at a higher position than that of the other connecting mechanism <b>58</b>. Rotation at the receipt printer <b>7</b> showing a larger height size in the present embodiment can be restricted more effectively because the connecting shaft <b>65</b> and the vertical wall <b>66</b> are arranged at a higher position than that of the other connecting mechanism <b>58</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0093">Additionally, in the present embodiment, the lower unit <b>48</b> acting as a unit having the movable blade <b>34</b> has the rotating shaft <b>39</b> acting as the movable blade holding section for holding the movable blade <b>34</b> and the movable blade <b>34</b> can be engaged with or disengaged from the rotating shaft <b>39</b>. Accordingly, when the movable blade <b>34</b> reaches its life time, the movable blade <b>34</b> is removed from the rotating shaft <b>39</b> to enable only the movable blade <b>34</b> to be easily replaced with a new one.</p>
  <p num="p-0094">In addition, in the present embodiment, there is provided an ECR <b>1</b> acting as a commodity information processing apparatus for processing information about the commodity, including the case <b>14</b> and the opening/closing cover <b>16</b> for opening or closing the port <b>14</b> <i>a </i>formed at the case <b>14</b>, wherein the case <b>14</b> is applied as a first casing member, the opening/closing cover <b>16</b> is applied as a second casing member, there is provided the receipt printer <b>7</b> acting as a printer, whereby it is possible to attain the ECR <b>1</b> having the same action and effect as that of the receipt printer <b>7</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0095">Next, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, another embodiment of the present invention will be described. The same sections as those of the aforesaid embodiment are denoted by the same reference symbols and their description will be eliminated.</p>
  <p num="p-0096"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a longitudinal side view showing a state in which the upper unit and the lower unit of the present embodiment are connected. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a receipt printer <b>80</b> of the present embodiment is different from the aforesaid embodiment in view of its constitutions of a lower unit <b>82</b> acting as a first unit and an upper unit <b>83</b> acting as a second unit.</p>
  <p num="p-0097">More practically, in the case of the receipt printer <b>80</b> of the present embodiment, the platen <b>24</b> is installed at the lower unit frame <b>84</b> to constitute the lower unit <b>82</b>, and the thermal head <b>25</b> is installed at the upper unit frame <b>85</b> to constitute the upper unit <b>83</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0098">The thermal head <b>25</b> is mounted to the head holding member <b>87</b>. The head holding member <b>87</b> is arranged to be rotatable in such a direction as one in which it can be moved to or moved away from the platen <b>24</b> and it is urged to the platen <b>24</b> by the coil spring <b>89</b> acting as the compression spring.</p>
  <p num="p-0099">The receipt printer <b>80</b> of the present embodiment is provided with a connecting mechanism <b>86</b> that is different from that of the above-described embodiment. The connecting mechanism <b>86</b> is comprised of two connecting shafts <b>90</b> and <b>91</b> provided in the upper unit frame <b>85</b>, a groove <b>92</b> formed in the lower unit frame <b>84</b> as a support section in which both ends of the connecting shaft <b>90</b> can be fitted, and a groove <b>93</b> formed in the lower unit frame <b>84</b> as a support section in which both ends of the connecting shaft <b>91</b> can be fitted. The connecting shafts <b>90</b> and <b>91</b> are mounted at the front and rear of the upper unit frame <b>85</b>, with their axes directed in parallel with the direction of the axis of the platen <b>24</b>. The grooves <b>92</b> and <b>93</b> are formed, open at the upper part, in a pair of inside walls <b>94</b> (an inside wall on one side is not shown) formed vertically inside of both side walls (not shown) of the lower unit frame <b>84</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0100">In the connecting mechanism <b>86</b>, the upper unit <b>83</b> is positioned in relation to the lower unit <b>82</b> by fitting the connecting shafts <b>90</b> and <b>91</b> in the grooves <b>92</b> and <b>93</b>, thus connecting the upper unit <b>83</b> to the lower unit <b>82</b>. In this state, the upper unit <b>83</b> is secured to the lower unit <b>82</b> to restrict the rotation of the upper unit <b>83</b> in relation to the lower unit <b>82</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0101">On the lower unit <b>82</b> a hook member <b>95</b> is provided. On the hook member <b>95</b> is formed the hook portion <b>69</b>, which can be engaged with, and disengaged from, the connecting shaft <b>91</b> fitted in the groove <b>93</b>. The hook member <b>95</b> is designed in such a manner that the hook <b>69</b> is rotatable about a fulcrum <b>96</b> toward engagement with, and disengagement from, the connecting shaft <b>91</b>. The hook member <b>95</b> is urged by a spring <b>97</b> toward engagement with the connecting shaft <b>91</b>, functioning similarly to the hook member <b>70</b> of the aforesaid embodiment.</p>
  <p num="p-0102">Therefore, it is possible to provide the receipt printer unit <b>80</b> of the above-described construction that incorporates the plated <b>24</b> mounted on the lower unit <b>82</b> and the thermal head <b>25</b> on the upper unit <b>83</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0103">Obviously, numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein.</p>
