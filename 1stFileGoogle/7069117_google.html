    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading> <p num="p-0002">The invention relates to electrical power distribution systems, processes and apparatus and power management in power distribution systems. More particularly, the present invention relates to power conservation and selective power regulation in power distribution systems.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">In electrical power distribution systems, several needs compete and must be simultaneously considered in managing electrical power distribution. A first concern has to do with maintaining delivered electrical power voltage levels within predetermined limits. A second concern relates to overall efficiency of electrical power generation and distribution. A third concern relates to these and other concerns in light of changing electrical loading of the system and variations in the character of the loading. A fourth concern relates to power system management under conditions associated with an increased probability of compromise of large scale ability to deliver appropriate power.</p>
    <p num="p-0004">It is generally desirable to manage a power grid to reduce overall power consumption while maintaining adequate delivered voltage minimum and maximum levels across the system. In other words, the voltage levels actually delivered to various users need to be kept within predetermined limits while delivering power efficiently, without undue power loss in the delivery system or power grid, including the power generation equipment. As power usage within the system changes, in accordance with diurnal, weekly and seasonal factors, among others, need for regulation of power distribution changes as well. To an extent, some of these changes are reasonably predictable, however, other aspects of these changes may not be readily predictable.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">Predictable changes in system loading are forecast by integrating power draw over time and considering this draw together with other factors, such as increased outdoor temperature and known diurnal variation patterns. For example, when summer heat results in increased power draw for air conditioning during the course of the day, fast food power draw associated with the end of the work day may indicate that a power shortage is immanent. Typically, measurements are made every minute or so, and adjustments to voltage are made perhaps once an hour. This is called “conservation voltage reduction” and is intended to reduce overall energy draw.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">However, compromise of power delivery capability due, for example, to extreme weather conditions (e.g., gale winds affecting the distribution system) or unforeseen decrease in available power (e.g., generator malfunction) is not necessarily amenable to precise forecasting but is observable. As a result, there is need for dynamic system adjustment in response to observed changes in system capacity, conditions and loading.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">Increased probability of compromise of large scale ability to deliver appropriate power may include increased probability of system-wide failure or blackout of an area, where “system-wide failure” could mean either a large grid being shut down or a smaller grid being isolated from a larger grid, with a potential result that the smaller grid then would be shut down or malfunction. In some cases, grid failure may be caused by automated shutdown of one or more generators in response to determination of grid conditions ill-suited to the generator in order to obviate catastrophic generator failure.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">The conditions associated with an increased probability of compromise of large scale ability to deliver appropriate power are varied, and can range from “brownout” situations to complete disruption of electrical service or “blackouts”. Some types of power consumption relate to relatively vital concerns, such as hospitals, infrastructural support systems (telephone, police, fire protection, electrical traffic signals and the like) and others relate to more quotidian concerns, such as air conditioning, fast food operations and industrial operations such as aluminum smelters and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">The latter types of concerns can present a high electrical draw at certain times of day. However, interruption of power delivery to such operations does not usually present life-threatening consequences when such operations are without electrical power.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">Further, in the event of severe disruption or demand, grid systems used for delivery of electrical power can experience catastrophic failure when load conditions presented to generators in the system are such that one or more electrical generators are automatically shut down or disconnected from the system. This situation obviously places increased demand or even less suitable loading conditions on other generators or grids to which the grid is coupled. As a result, other generators or grids coupled to the affected grid may disconnect from the affected grid, potentially resulting in a blackout. Such blackouts can be extremely widespread in electrical generation and distribution systems employed multiple coupled grids each having electrical generation capability.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">Prior art power regulation systems include opening switches at a power station or substation to remove load components, or sending out trucks with technicians to manually open switches to remove portions of the load from the system, or to manually adjust power regulators and set points. These methods are not amenable to rapid, dynamic load adjustment or rapid, dynamic power management.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">Another prior art system provides equipment at the user site that disables high load appliances, such as hot water heaters, on demand. This may be based on forecasting of anticipated excess demand. Such systems are known as “demand side control” systems. These tend to be expensive, in part because the number of control switches is high.</p>
    <p num="p-0013">Needed are systems, apparatus and processes for (i) optimizing efficiency of power delivery while maintaining delivered voltage levels within acceptable limits under changing conditions for electrical power demand and (ii) coping with conditions associated with an increased probability of compromise of large scale ability to deliver appropriate power in such a way as to avoid compromise of critical concerns and to further avoid catastrophic electrical system failure.</p>

The process includes determining, by the controller, that increasing an output electrical parameter associated with the device will reduce power consumption, and increasing an output electrical parameter associated with the device in response to the controller determining that such will reduce power consumption.</p>

The controller is further configured to determine that conditions associated with decreased stability of the power distribution may exist and first adjust the at least one device, in response to the determination that conditions associated with decreased stability of the power distribution may exist, to increase delivered voltage in at least a portion of the power distribution system when the controller determines that this will increase overall system stability.</p>

    <p num="p-0028"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a simplified block diagram of an electrical power distribution system <b>10</b>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The power distribution system <b>10</b> includes a power station <b>12</b>, that may be coupled to a power source or sink via a high voltage bus <b>14</b>. In one embodiment, the power station <b>12</b> includes one or more generators. In one embodiment, the power station <b>12</b> distributes power delivered via the bus <b>14</b>. In one embodiment, the power station <b>12</b> delivers power to other power distribution systems via the bus <b>14</b>. As will be appreciated, the role of the power station <b>12</b> may change with time and demand, i.e., it may supply excess power to other systems when local load conditions permit and it may be supplied with power at other times when local load conditions require such.</p>
    <p num="p-0029">The power station <b>12</b> includes one or more group controllers <b>16</b>. Power is distributed via buses <b>18</b> from the power station <b>12</b> to one or more substations <b>20</b>. In turn, each substation <b>20</b> delivers power further “downstream” via buses <b>22</b>. It will be appreciated that a series of voltage transformations are typically involved in transmission and distribution of electrical power via the various power stations <b>12</b> and substations <b>20</b> and that the system <b>10</b> being described exemplifies such systems that may include additional or fewer layers of transformation and distribution.</p>
    <p num="p-0030">The substation <b>20</b> delivers electrical power via buses <b>22</b> to one or more power regulation devices <b>24</b>, which may include a local controller <b>26</b>. In turn, the power regulation devices <b>24</b> deliver electrical power further downstream via buses <b>28</b>. Ultimately, electrical power is coupled to a sensor <b>30</b> and/or to a user <b>32</b>. Sensors <b>30</b> tend to be associated with critical loads such as hospitals.</p>
    <p num="p-0031">In one embodiment, the electrical power is coupled to a sensor <b>30</b> capable of determining electrical parameters associated with power consumption and transmitting those assessed parameters to the associated local controller <b>26</b> and/or to the group controller <b>16</b>. It will be appreciated that any medium suitable to data transmission may be employed, such as radio links, which may utilize spread spectrum coding techniques, point-to-point radio links, fiber optical links, leased lines, data signals coupled via power lines or buses, telephone links or other infrastructural data communications paths. In some embodiments, such may also be conveniently collateral to power distribution system elements (e.g., coaxial cables employed for data transmission such as are often employed in cable television systems).</p>
    <p num="p-0032">In one embodiment, the sensor <b>30</b> measures voltage and is also part of an electrical meter used for measuring the amount of electrical power used and thus for determining billing data, such as a conventional Automatic Meter Reader or AMR. In one embodiment, the sensor <b>30</b> is equipped to assess line voltage delivered to the user <b>32</b>, or “delivered voltage”. In one embodiment, the sensor <b>30</b> is equipped to measure current.</p>
    <p num="p-0033">In one embodiment, the local controller is configured to respond to several associated sensors. This may be accomplished by dynamically determining which one or ones of an associated plurality of sensors is providing data most relevant to determining how to most effectively adjust the associated output electrical parameter. Effective control of power delivered by the associated power regulation device <b>24</b> is determined by “voting” between the associated sensors, dependent upon changes in current draw in different loads controlled by the power regulation device <b>24</b>, load shifts or voltage changes. In one embodiment, the “vote” tends to be responsive to the sensor that results in optimal power conservation.</p>
    <p num="p-0034">In one embodiment, the sensor <b>30</b> is equipped to assess power factor, also known as VAR or Volt Amperes Reactive, that is, the phase shift induced by inductive or capacitive loads. Power factor can be significant because transmission losses known as I<sup>2</sup>R losses can increase when the currents associated with driving the load increase without necessarily delivering more total work to the load.</p>
    <p num="p-0035">These losses can result in situations where the total power drawn from the power station <b>10</b> or substation <b>20</b> actually decreases when line voltage to the user <b>32</b> increases. One example of such a situation is where the load is highly inductive and the amount of work accomplished is controlled primarily by the amount of current drawn by the load, e.g., loads including electrical motors.</p>
    <p num="p-0036">Conventional power distribution systems provide some correction of or management of power factor or VAR by switching reactive elements, such as shunt capacitors, into or out of the system at strategic locations. These conventional systems do not attempt to reduce losses by voltage adjustment.</p>
    <p num="p-0037">Conventional Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems have not in past been associated with incremental voltage controllers. In particular, such systems have not been affiliated with controllers that are equipped to test for conditions where an increase in delivered voltage can reduce overall power consumption by providing improved power factor.</p>
    <p num="p-0038">In the present, inventive system, such a controller advantageously also effectuates data collection and logging. In one embodiment, at least the group controller <b>16</b> records a conventional system data log for tracking voltage, current, kiloWatt hours and power factor or kilo volt-amp reactive power and the like over time. In one embodiment, at least the group controller <b>16</b> records a conventional event log for tracking load tap control data, voltage regulation data and breaker operations and the like over time. In one embodiment, at least the group controller <b>16</b> records a conventional status log for tracking position of load tap controls, voltage regulator setting, breaker settings and the like over time.</p>
    <p num="p-0039">In one embodiment, at least the group controller <b>16</b> records minimum and maximum values for conventional electrical parameters such as voltage, kiloWatt flow, KVAR and the like versus time. In one embodiment, such conventional data are collected at regular intervals, such as every thirty seconds or every minute. In one embodiment, additional such conventional data logs are recorded by local controllers <b>26</b> as well.</p>
    <p num="p-0040"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a simplified block diagram of a power controller <b>24</b> for use in the system <b>10</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The power controller <b>24</b> includes the local controller <b>26</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The local controller <b>26</b> is linked to the group controller <b>16</b> via a data path <b>34</b> and is linked to the downstream sensors <b>30</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> via a data path <b>36</b>. The power controller <b>24</b> accepts input electrical energy V<sub>IN </sub>via a bus <b>38</b> that is coupled to a voltage regulator <b>40</b>. In one embodiment, the voltage regulator <b>40</b> comprises a conventional autotransformer employing a make-before-break variable tap that is set in conformance with command signals communicated from the local controller <b>16</b> via a data path <b>42</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0041">The power controller <b>24</b> also optionally includes a data path <b>44</b> coupled to switches <b>46</b>. The switches <b>46</b> couple elements <b>48</b> for power factor management into or out of the circuit in response to commands from the local controller <b>26</b>. In one embodiment, the elements <b>48</b> comprise conventional capacitors that are switched into or out of the circuit in conformance with commands from the local controller <b>26</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0042">A sensor <b>50</b> is coupled to the local controller <b>26</b> via a data path <b>52</b>. The sensor <b>50</b> measures electrical parameters associated with electrical energy leaving the power controller <b>24</b>, such as kiloWatt hours, current, voltage and/or power factor. The power controller <b>24</b> delivers electrical energy V<sub>OUT </sub>for downstream distribution via a bus <b>54</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0043">In one embodiment, the local controller <b>26</b> regulates power delivery subject to overriding commands from the group controller <b>16</b>. In one embodiment, the power controller <b>24</b> increments (or decrements) line voltage at the 120/240 volt distribution level. In one embodiment, the power controller <b>24</b> changes output voltage in increments of ⅝%, or about 0.75 volt steps at the 120 volt level. In one embodiment, when larger changes in voltage are desirable, the power controller <b>24</b> allows a stabilization interval of between forty seconds and two minutes between an increment and evaluation of system parameters prior to making a next incremental voltage change.</p>
    <p num="p-0044">In one embodiment, the power controller <b>24</b> maintains delivered line voltage in band of voltages ranging from about 110 volts or 114 volts to about 126 volts to 129 volts, with 117 volts being exemplary, and with a reduced level of about 110 to 100 volts being applicable in emergency or brownout situations.</p>
    <p num="p-0045">In one embodiment, multiple power controllers <b>24</b> are situated downstream of a master controller <b>24</b>. For example, in aluminum smelting plants, such an arrangement may be advantageous in order to provide a recommended voltage or current to the smelting pots, and to optimize energy costs.</p>
    <p num="p-0046">In silicon refining plants, power control can be crucial to maintaining the melt at the appropriate temperature and also for maintaining an appropriate rotation speed in Czochralski crystal growth apparatus. As a result, the criticality of power regulation depends on the end use to which the user puts the power. Programming parameters used in the local controller <b>26</b> of the power controllers <b>24</b> can be set in light of these needs to effect the desired power regulation.</p>
    <p num="p-0047">In some power distribution situations, power control is important because the contractual arrangements between the user and the service provider result in increased power rates for a period, such as a year, if a maximum or peak amount of power contracted for is exceeded even once. Accordingly, such users have incentives to regulate power use to obviate exceeding that contractual amount.</p>
    <p num="p-0048"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a simplified block diagram of an exemplary system <b>60</b> illustrating application of the power controller <b>24</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In the exemplary system <b>60</b>, electrical power is distributed at a first voltage, such as 115 kiloVolts, over bus <b>62</b>. The electrical power is stepped down to a reduced voltage, such as 12.5 kiloVolts, by a transformer <b>64</b>, and is transmitted downstream via a bus <b>66</b>. A billing meter <b>68</b> may be coupled to the bus <b>66</b>. The local controller <b>26</b> includes one or more processors <b>69</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0049">Taps <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> are coupled to a power monitor PM <b>74</b> in the local controller <b>26</b> to allow the processor <b>69</b> to monitor electrical parameters associated with the power controller <b>24</b>. In one embodiment, the power monitor PM <b>74</b> monitors voltage. In one embodiment, the power monitor PM <b>74</b> monitors power factor. In one embodiment, the power monitor PM <b>74</b> monitors electrical power. In one embodiment, the power monitor PM <b>74</b> monitors current. A conventional recloser or circuit breaker <b>76</b> is coupled in series with the bus <b>66</b> and is coupled to the processor <b>69</b> in the local controller <b>26</b> via a data path <b>78</b>, allowing monitoring and/or control of the recloser <b>76</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0050">The processor <b>69</b> in the local controller <b>26</b> is coupled to the group controller <b>16</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) via data path <b>34</b>. In this example, a conventional modem <b>79</b> is employed for bidirectional data transfer.</p>
    <p num="p-0051">A voltage regulator <b>80</b> is coupled in series in the bus <b>66</b>. The voltage regulator <b>80</b> is responsive to control signals delivered from the processor <b>69</b> in the local controller <b>26</b> via a data path <b>82</b>, and the local controller <b>26</b> also is able to collect status data from the voltage regulator <b>80</b> via this data path.</p>
    <p num="p-0052">Electrical power is then transferred downstream via the bus <b>66</b>, which may include line voltage monitors LVM <b>84</b> disposed at strategic intervals and in data communication with the local controller <b>26</b>. In one embodiment, a step-down transformer, instrument transformer, potential transformer or transducer <b>86</b> located near the point of use transforms the intermediate voltage employed on the bus <b>66</b> to voltages suitable for sensing equipment such as a sensing module <b>88</b>. The device <b>86</b> is calibrated to permit readings corresponding to user voltages but is not necessarily as precise as transformers used to transform intermediate transmission voltage levels to end use voltage levels.</p>
    <p num="p-0053">The module <b>88</b> for measuring electrical parameters associated with delivered power and/or voltage is typically located at or near the transformer or device <b>86</b>, between or near the transformer or device <b>86</b> and the end user <b>32</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and may include power measurement devices PMD <b>89</b> for billing purposes. The module <b>88</b> is in data communication with the local controller <b>26</b> via a data path, in this example, via a radio <b>90</b> that exchanges radio signals with a radio <b>92</b> that is coupled to the processor <b>69</b> in the local controller <b>26</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0054">Data communications via the various links may be effected using any known or conventional data transfer protocol and method, e.g., may be signals transmitted using American Standard Code II (ASCII) via an RS-232 serial data port, for example.</p>
    <p num="p-0055"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a simplified flow chart of a process P<b>1</b> for managing the electrical power distribution system of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0056">The process P<b>1</b> begins with a step S<b>1</b>. In the step S<b>1</b>, the local power controller <b>24</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref> increments or decrements at least one parameter associated with electrical power that is being distributed, such as line voltage. The process P<b>1</b> then waits for a predetermined interval for the system to settle, which, in one embodiment, may range from about forty seconds to two minutes.</p>
    <p num="p-0057">In a query task S<b>2</b>, the process P<b>1</b> determines if the actions taken in the step S<b>1</b> resulted in a decrease in power consumption. When the query task S<b>2</b> determines that the actions taken in the step S<b>1</b> resulted in an increase in power consumption, control passes to steps S<b>3</b> and S<b>4</b>. When the query task S<b>2</b> determines that the actions taken in the step S<b>1</b> resulted in a decrease in power consumption, control passes to a step S<b>5</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0058">In the step S<b>3</b>, the actions taken in the step S<b>1</b> are reversed. In other words, when the query task S<b>2</b> determines that overall power consumption increases when the voltage decreases, the power controller <b>24</b> then returns to that voltage setting initially present and waits for the system to settle in the step S<b>3</b>. The process P<b>1</b> then increases the voltage in the step S<b>4</b> and again waits for the system to settle. Similarly, when the query task S<b>2</b> determines that overall power consumption increases when the voltage increases, the power controller <b>24</b> returns to that voltage setting initially present and waits for the system to settle in the step S<b>3</b>. The process P<b>1</b> then decreases the voltage in the step S<b>4</b> and again waits for the system to settle. Following the step S<b>4</b>, control passes back to the query task S<b>2</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0059">The increments in voltage are subject to predetermined voltage maximum and minimum values, which may in turn depend on or be changed in response to system conditions. In other words, if the voltage is initially at the predetermined minimum, the process P<b>1</b> tests the system with an increase in voltage but not a decrease.</p>
    <p num="p-0060">When the query task S<b>2</b> determines that the power consumption has decreased, the process P<b>1</b> iterates the steps S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> (which may include steps S<b>3</b> and S<b>4</b>) in a step S<b>5</b>. The iteration of the step S<b>5</b> continues until no further decrease in power consumption is observed. In other words, the process P<b>1</b> determines a line voltage consistent with reducing overall power consumption.</p>
    <p num="p-0061">The process P<b>1</b> then sets the line voltage to the optimum voltage or the voltage at which minimum power consumption occurred in a step S<b>6</b>. The process P<b>1</b> then ends.</p>
    <p num="p-0062"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a simplified flow chart of a process P<b>2</b> for operating the power regulation devices <b>24</b> or the local controller <b>26</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The process P<b>2</b> begins with a query task S<b>21</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0063">In the query task S<b>21</b>, the process P<b>2</b> determines when a predetermined interval has passed without a voltage adjustment occurring. In one embodiment, the predetermined interval is in a range of one half hour to one hour.</p>
    <p num="p-0064">When the query task S<b>21</b> determines that such an interval has not passed without a voltage adjustment, control passes back to the step S<b>21</b>. When the query task S<b>21</b> determines that such an interval has passed without a voltage adjustment, control passes to a step S<b>22</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0065">In the step S<b>22</b>, a first power consumption level is measured. Control then passes to a step S<b>23</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0066">In the step S<b>23</b>, the power controller <b>24</b> adjusts a line voltage within predetermined limits and then waits for a predetermined interval for the system to settle. In one embodiment, the predetermined settling interval is in a range of from forty seconds to two minutes. Control then passes to a step S<b>24</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0067">In the step S<b>24</b>, a second power consumption level is measured. Control then passes to a query task S<b>25</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0068">In the query task S<b>25</b>, the process P<b>2</b> determines when the second power level is less than the first power consumption level. When the query task S<b>25</b> determines that the second power consumption level is less than the first power consumption level, control passes to a step S<b>26</b>. When the query task S<b>25</b> determines that the second power consumption level is greater than the first power consumption level, control passes to a step S<b>27</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0069">In the step S<b>26</b>, the process P<b>2</b> iterates the steps S<b>22</b> through S<b>25</b> to determine a line voltage associated with optimal power consumption levels and set the voltage to this level. The process P<b>2</b> then ends.</p>
    <p num="p-0070">In the step S<b>27</b>, the process P<b>2</b> iterates the steps S<b>22</b> through S<b>25</b> but with the increment reversed from the increment or decrement employed in the first instantiation of the step S<b>22</b>. Control then passes to a step S<b>28</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0071">In the step S<b>28</b>, the process P<b>2</b> determines a voltage for optimal power consumption in the system and sets the voltage to that level. The process P<b>2</b> then ends.</p>
    <p num="p-0072"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a simplified flow chart of a process P<b>3</b> for managing the electrical power distribution system of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The process P<b>3</b> begins in a query task S<b>31</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0073">In the query task S<b>31</b>, a group controller <b>16</b> determines when conditions associated with an increased probability of compromise of appropriate delivery of electrical power are present.</p>
    <p num="p-0074">This may be forecast from observed power consumption trends and knowledge of prevailing conditions, analogous to situations invoking conventional power peak demand management techniques such as demand control, or it may be due to observable emergency electrical disturbance caused by a catastrophy of one sort or another. These kinds of situations have been dealt with in past using ON/OFF switching of one sort or another for shedding portions or all of the load.</p>
    <p num="p-0075">When the query task S<b>31</b> determines that such conditions are not present, the process P<b>3</b> ends. When the query task S<b>31</b> determines that such conditions are present, the group controller <b>16</b> transmits signals to local controllers <b>26</b> to cause them to set the power controllers <b>24</b> to predetermined values consistent with reduction of system power requirements in a step S<b>32</b>. Control then passes back to the query task S<b>31</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0076">For example, when the system is subject to severe loading, delivered voltage reduction may be implemented. The initial delivered voltage might, for example, have been 117 volts. As the voltage is being incrementally reduced towards 110 volts (representing the lower setpoint), and the system is being monitored, a minimum in power consumption might occur at 112 volts. The controller of the present invention will locate this minimum and can set the delivered voltage to that value. When system conditions will not support system loading, even at the lower setpoint, the setpoints may be reset or other corrective actions described herein may take place, depending on circumstances.</p>
    <p num="p-0077">The present invention provides greater flexibility than prior systems in that incremental voltage or power adjustment is possible and practical, and may be automatically implemented. In one embodiment, and under appropriate conditions, some users, such as residential users and some types of commercial users, are denied power or are provided with reduced power at a first power level, while other users, such as hospitals, emergency facilities, law enforcement facilities and traffic control systems, are provided with power at a second power level that is greater than the first power level or are left at full power. In one embodiment, multiple tiers of users are provided with various grades of power reduction or non-reduction.</p>
    <p num="p-0078">In some areas, hydroelectric or other electrical power generation systems have been extensively developed, while other areas may not lend themselves to such development. One example of the former occurs in the Pacific Northwest, where hydroelectric power generation capabilities have been extensively developed. As a result, power generation facilities in the Pacific Northwest are able to produce more power than may be needed in that geographical area from time to time.</p>
    <p num="p-0079">A delivery area such as California, on the other hand, has extensive power needs but has limited ability to produce electrical power, and is bordered by desert areas that also do not lend themselves to hydroelectric power production. Thus, power stations in the Pacific Northwest may be able to, and in fact do, sell electricity generated in the Pacific Northwest to users in other places, such as California.</p>
    <p num="p-0080">This leads to some fluctuations in demand in the Pacific Northwest power generation stations. At times, reductions in demand in the generation area (in this example, the Pacific Northwest) require that the system dissipate some of the electrical power that is generated there in order to preserve synchronization of the generators with each other and with other portions of the grid. In at least some cases, this need to dissipate electrical power is met by coupling large resistors across the generators. Typically, these are very large conventional nichrome wire resistors.</p>
    <p num="p-0081">In some situations, the need to slew power into these resistors can arise rather abruptly. For example, when weather-, earthquake-, fire- or vehicular-driven events damage a portion of the distribution infrastructure in the delivery area or between the delivery area and the generation area, rapid changes in system dynamics are possible.</p>
    <p num="p-0082">However, the controllers <b>16</b> and <b>24</b> of the present invention can be advantageously employed to increase voltage that is delivered in the generation area and in other portions of the grid that is serviced by generators in that area. The controllers <b>16</b> and <b>24</b> can adjust delivered voltages upward but stay within the predetermined limits appropriate for normal power service. As a result, system stability is increased.</p>

    <p num="p-0084">The process P<b>4</b> begins with a query task S<b>41</b>. In the query task S<b>41</b>, the process P<b>4</b> determines when an increase in delivered voltage, within the predetermined voltage setpoints, will result in improved stability for the system <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0085">When the query task S<b>41</b> determines that an increase in voltage is appropriate for improving stability of the system <b>10</b>, control passes to a step S<b>42</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0086">In the step S<b>42</b>, a controller in the system such as the group controller <b>16</b> increases voltage delivered to the users <b>32</b>. Typically, the increase in voltage is incremental, as discussed hereinbefore, and is followed by a predetermined settling period and then data collection regarding system parameters. Control then passes back to the query task S<b>41</b> to determine if another increase in voltage is appropriate for the system <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0087">When the query task S<b>41</b> determines that an increase in voltage is inconsistent with an increase in stability of the system <b>10</b>, or is not appropriate for such system <b>10</b>, control passes to the query task S<b>43</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0088">In the query task S<b>43</b>, the process P<b>4</b> determines when a decrease in delivered voltage is appropriate for increasing stability for the system <b>10</b> and is consistent with the predetermined setpoints. When the query task S<b>43</b> determines that a decrease in delivered voltage is appropriate for increasing system stability, control passes to a step S<b>44</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0089">In the step S<b>42</b>, a controller in the system such as the group controller <b>16</b> decreases voltage delivered to the users <b>32</b>. Typically, the decrease in voltage is incremental, as discussed hereinbefore, and is followed by a predetermined settling period and then data collection regarding system parameters. Control then passes back to the query task S<b>41</b> to determine if an increase in voltage is appropriate for the system <b>10</b>. The process P<b>4</b> then ends.</p>
    <p num="p-0090">It will be appreciated that the processes P<b>1</b> through P<b>4</b> are cooperative with each other and with other processes carried out in the system <b>10</b>. For example, when the system <b>10</b> no longer poses a stability issue, the process P<b>4</b> may be terminated and power control may be determined by other factors in the system. Additionally, the processes P<b>1</b> through P<b>4</b> are structured to maintain delivered voltage at an appropriate level, such as within a range determined by programmable setpoints.</p>
    <p num="p-0091">From the foregoing, it is apparent the present invention provides systems, processes and apparatus which can be utilized to monitor and manage electrical power distribution. Further, the disclosed systems, processes and apparatus permit power conservation and also can provide more robust power delivery under inclement power system loading conditions. In addition, the systems, processes and apparatus of the present invention are cost effective when compared with other power management devices.</p>
    <p num="p-0092">In contrast to prior art systems, the present systems, processes and apparatus provide infinite variability of system parameters, such as multiple, different delivered voltage levels, within predetermined limits. For example, all users can be incrementally adjusted up or down together, or some users may be adjusted to a first degree while other users are adjusted to another degree or to separate, differing degrees. Such advantageously provides new flexibility in power distribution control, in addition to providing new methods of adjustment.</p>
    <p num="p-0093">In compliance with the statute, the invention has been described in language more or less specific as to structural and methodical features. It is to be understood, however, that the invention is not limited to the specific features shown and described, since the systems, processes and apparatus herein disclosed comprise exemplary forms of putting the invention into effect. The invention is, therefore, claimed in any of its forms or modifications within the proper scope of the appended claims appropriately interpreted in accordance with the doctrine of equivalents.</p>
