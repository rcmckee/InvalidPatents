    <p>This is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 09/083,406, filed May 22, 1998, for ACETABULAR CUP ASSEMBLY WITH SELECTED BEARING.</p>
    <p>The present invention relates generally to prosthetic implants and pertains, more specifically, to the implant of acetabular cup assemblies which secure a prosthetic bearing member in the acetabulum for the reception of a femoral head of a prosthetic hip joint.</p>
    <p>The replacement of members of a natural hip joint with prosthetic implants has become widespread and is being accomplished with ever-increasing frequency. The variety of conditions encountered when effecting such implants has led to the use of various bearing materials placed at an optimum position and orientation, as determined by conditions encountered at the site of the implant. The choice of a particular material for the bearing, as well as the size, positioning and orientation of the bearing member, is determined by the surgeon performing the procedure. Usually such choices are made on the basis of a pre-operative assessment of the needs of a particular patient; however, at times the choices are not completed until the implant site actually is being prepared and conditions encountered at the site can be evaluated during the implant procedure itself. Accordingly, it would be advantageous to have available a greater range of interoperative choice, as well as pre-operative choice, so as to enable a surgeon to accommodate the needs of a particular patient as determined by either or both a pre-operative assessment and an evaluation of conditions encountered at a particular implant site, and to do so in a practical manner.</p>
    <p>The present invention provides the surgeon with the ability to choose, either pre-operatively or interoperatively, an optimum material, position and orientation for a bearing member of an acetabular cup assembly to be implanted at a particular implant site, with increased ease and at lowered expense. As such, the present invention attains several objects and advantages, some of which are summarized as follows: Accommodates a wider choice of bearing materials in the bearing member of an acetabular cup assembly, while utilizing a common acetabular shell; enables the choice of size, position and orientation of the bearing surface of a bearing member selected for assembly with a particular acetabular shell; increases the range of bearing materials, as well as bearing size, positioning and orientation, and renders the choices available in a practical manner for either pre-operative or interoperative selection; allows a surgeon greater latitude in accommodating the needs of different patients while meeting the requirements imposed by various conditions encountered at a particular implant site, and enables appropriate choices to be made interoperatively, as well as pre-operatively; promotes greater accuracy in the replacement of a natural hip joint, with increased economy; provides a surgeon with the ability to make both pre-operative choices and interoperative choices from a wider range of options; enables the securement of a bearing member of selected material within a common acetabular shell, with increased ease and economy, and without complex, specialized instruments; facilitates the insertion and securement of a selected bearing member within an acetabular shell in appropriate alignment and orientation of the bearing member within the acetabular shell; provides an acetabular cup assembly having a bearing member of appropriate bearing material and accurate sizing, positioning and orientation, with economy of manufacture and use, and long-term reliability.</p>

    <p>Further, the present invention provides a shell member for use in an acetabular cup assembly having an internal bearing member for securement within the shell member, the internal bearing member being selected from a plurality of bearing members having different characteristics such that the acetabular cup assembly selectively is provided with characteristics corresponding to the characteristics of the selected internal bearing member, the shell member comprising: an internal cavity; a first securing element within the cavity of the shell member, the first securing element being compatible with the securing characteristics of at least one of the plurality of internal bearing members; and a second securing element within the cavity of the shell member, the second securing element being compatible with the securing characteristics of at least another of the plurality of internal bearing members; the first and second securing elements being juxtaposed with one another and placed at relative locations such that the effectiveness of each of the first and second securing elements is maintained in the presence of the other of the first and second securing elements, whereby the one and the another of the internal bearing members each is selectable for effective securement within the shell member to complete the acetabular cup assembly.</p>
    <p>In addition, the present invention includes a kit of component parts for assembling an acetabular cup assembly having an internal bearing member secured within a shell member, the kit comprising: a plurality of bearing members having different characteristics such that the acetabular cup assembly selectively is provided with characteristics corresponding to the characteristics of a selected one of the internal bearing members; the shell member comprising: an internal cavity; a first securing element within the cavity of the shell member, the first securing element being compatible with the securing characteristics of at least one of the plurality of internal bearing members; and a second securing element within the cavity of the shell member, the second securing element being compatible with the securing characteristics of at least another of the plurality of internal bearing members; the first and second securing elements being juxtaposed with one another and placed at relative locations such that the effectiveness of each of the first and second securing elements is maintained in the presence of the other of the first and second securing elements, whereby the one and the another of the internal bearing members each is selectable for effective securement within the shell member as the selected one bearing member to complete the acetabular cup assembly.</p>
    <p>Still further, the present invention provides an improvement in a method for implanting an acetabular cup assembly having an external shell member with an internal cavity, and an internal bearing member for securement within the cavity, the internal bearing member being selected from a plurality of bearing members having different characteristics such that the acetabular cup assembly selectively is provided with characteristics corresponding to the characteristics of the selected internal bearing member, the improvement comprising the steps of: providing a first securing element within the cavity of the shell member, the first securing element being compatible with the securing characteristics of at least one of the plurality of internal bearing members; providing a second securing element within the cavity of the shell member, the second securing element being compatible with the securing characteristics of at least another of the plurality of internal bearing members; and selecting the one or the another of the internal bearing members and securing the selected internal bearing member within the shell member by engaging the selected internal bearing member with the corresponding first securing element or second securing element for completion of the acetabular cup assembly.</p>

    <p>Referring now to the drawing, and especially to FIGS. 1 through 3 thereof, an acetabular cup assembly constructed in accordance with the present invention is illustrated generally at <b>20</b>. Acetabular cup assembly <b>20</b> includes a shell component in the form of metallic shell member <b>22</b> and a bearing insert which, in this instance, is in the form of a plastic bearing member <b>24</b>. Shell member <b>22</b> includes an outer surface <b>26</b> having a profile configuration which enables the shell member <b>22</b> to be seated and fixed in place within an appropriately prepared acetabulum in a now well-known manner. A plurality of screw holes <b>28</b> are provided in the shell member <b>22</b> for receiving anchoring screws (not shown) when such supplemental securing means are desired. An inner cavity <b>30</b> extends upwardly into shell member <b>22</b>, from a lower opening <b>32</b> at a lower end <b>34</b> toward an upper end <b>36</b>. A rim <b>38</b> is located at the lower end <b>34</b>.</p>
    <p>Bearing member <b>24</b> has a generally domed exterior <b>40</b> which is essentially complementary to the cavity <b>30</b> of the shell member <b>22</b> and extends longitudinally from a base <b>42</b> to a top <b>44</b>. A basal flange <b>46</b> extends circumferentially around the base <b>42</b> of the bearing member <b>24</b> and projects laterally outwardly to provide a transverse bearing face <b>48</b> at the base <b>42</b> of the bearing member <b>24</b>. A bearing socket <b>50</b> extends upwardly into the bearing member <b>24</b> and provides a spherical bearing surface <b>52</b> for a complementary femoral head (not shown).</p>
    <p>Acetabular cup assembly <b>20</b> is to be implanted in stages; that is, the shell member <b>22</b> and the bearing member <b>24</b> are to be assembled interoperatively, so as to enable appropriate sizing, placement and orientation of the bearing socket <b>50</b>, based upon a pre-operative assessment or upon an evaluation of conditions encountered at the site of the implant. To that end, alternate bearing members <b>24</b> are made available, in a kit of component parts, which kit provides a plurality of bearing members, the alternate bearing members <b>24</b> providing corresponding bearing sockets <b>50</b> placed at different locations and orientations, relative to the seated and secured shell member <b>22</b>, any one of which bearing sockets <b>50</b> then being capable of securement in place in the shell member <b>22</b>, interoperatively, with the bearing surface <b>52</b> appropriately located and oriented for accommodating the needs of the patient.</p>
    <p>A selected bearing member <b>24</b> is secured in place appropriately within the shell member <b>22</b> by means of a securing mechanism <b>60</b> provided adjacent the lower end <b>34</b> of the shell member <b>22</b> and adjacent the base <b>42</b> of the bearing member <b>24</b>. Turning now to FIGS. 4 through 6, as well as to FIGS. 1 through 3, securing mechanism <b>60</b> is seen to include a securing element in the form of an annular recess <b>62</b> extending laterally outwardly into the shell member <b>22</b> adjacent the lower end <b>34</b>. a complementary securing element in the form of an annular rib <b>64</b> extends laterally outwardly from the bearing member <b>24</b>, adjacent the base <b>42</b> of the bearing member <b>24</b>. A preferred material for the plastic bearing member <b>24</b> is an ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene commonly used in connection with such bearing members, the securing characteristics of which material include a resiliency sufficient to assure that upon inserting the bearing member <b>24</b> into the shell member <b>22</b>, and seating the bearing member <b>24</b> in the shell member <b>22</b>, as seen in FIG. 6, the annular rib <b>64</b> is seated within the annular recess <b>62</b> to secure the bearing member <b>24</b> within the shell member <b>22</b>.</p>
    <p>The position and orientation of the bearing socket <b>50</b> relative to the fixed shell member <b>22</b> are selected by providing the different locations and orientations of the bearing socket <b>50</b> within the bearing member <b>24</b>, as set forth above. Thus, as seen in FIG. 1, the bearing socket <b>50</b> may be offset from the central axis C of the bearing member <b>24</b>, as illustrated in phantom by an alternate offset bearing socket <b>50</b>A, by varied amounts in different selectable bearing members <b>24</b>, for the selection of an appropriate position for the bearing socket <b>50</b> at the implant site. Likewise, an appropriate orientation of bearing socket <b>50</b> is made available through the provision of alternate angled orientations, as illustrated in phantom by an alternately oriented bearing socket <b>50</b>B in FIG. <b>1</b>. Once seated in place, the selected bearing member <b>24</b> is secured within the shell member <b>22</b> by engagement of the complementary securing elements in the form of recess <b>62</b> and rib <b>64</b>, common to the securing mechanism <b>60</b> provided for all of the alternate bearing members <b>24</b>. In addition, once the selected bearing member <b>24</b> is seated appropriately within the shell member <b>22</b>, rotation of the bearing member <b>24</b> about the axis C relative to the shell member <b>22</b> is precluded by engagement of protrusions <b>70</b> extending radially inwardly from the rim <b>38</b> of the shell member <b>22</b> with counterpart portions <b>72</b> of the bearing member <b>24</b>, adjacent the flange <b>46</b> of the bearing member <b>24</b>.</p>
    <p>Should the surgeon determine, either on the basis of a pre-operative assessment of a patient or during the course of the implant procedure, that based upon the needs of a particular patient, as determined by the pre-operative assessment or by an evaluation of conditions encountered at the particular implant site, a bearing material having characteristics other than those of the material of bearing member <b>24</b> would be more appropriate, acetabular cup assembly <b>20</b> provides the surgeon with the ability to choose a bearing member having a bearing material which exhibits characteristics more appropriate to the needs of that particular patient. Thus, as seen in FIGS. 7 through 10, an alternate bearing member <b>80</b>, provided as another of the plurality of bearing members made available in the aforesaid kit, is constructed of a ceramic material and includes a generally domed exterior portion <b>82</b> which extends to a top <b>84</b>. A bearing socket <b>86</b> extends upwardly into the bearing member <b>80</b> and provides a spherical bearing surface <b>88</b> for a complementary femoral head (not shown).</p>
    <p>One of the most effective, convenient, mechanically simple and easily used securement mechanisms available for securing together mechanical components, where neither component is constructed of a resilient material such as the material of plastic bearing member <b>24</b>, is mating tapered surfaces. The degree to which the tapered surfaces are tapered depends upon securing characteristics of the particular materials being secured together. However, the securing characteristics of ceramic bearing member <b>80</b> are such that securement of the bearing member <b>80</b> is best accomplished with a securement surface which is essentially cylindrical. Accordingly, bearing member <b>80</b> is provided with an external receptor element in the form of a generally cylindrical securement surface <b>90</b> which extends essentially parallel to the central axis C of the bearing member <b>80</b>, between lower end <b>92</b> of the bearing member <b>80</b> and the domed exterior portion <b>82</b>. In order to enable simplified interoperative securement of the bearing member <b>80</b> within shell member <b>22</b>, subsequent to locating and seating shell member <b>22</b> within the acetabulum, securing mechanism <b>60</b> provides appropriate mating tapered surfaces. Thus, securing mechanism <b>60</b> includes a metallic securing member shown in the form of a sleeve <b>100</b> having an annular ring portion <b>102</b> adjacent a lower end <b>103</b> and a domed portion <b>104</b> extending between the ring portion <b>102</b> and an upper end <b>105</b>. The domed portion <b>104</b> is essentially complementary to the counterpart portion of the inner cavity <b>30</b> of the shell member <b>22</b>, and the ring portion <b>102</b> is provided with an external securing element in the form of an external seating surface <b>106</b> and an internal receptor element in the form of a generally cylindrical internal securement surface <b>108</b>. The configuration of the internal securement surface <b>108</b> and the configuration of the external securement surface <b>90</b> are compatible with the particular characteristics of the material of the bearing member <b>80</b> so that upon engagement of the external securement surface <b>90</b> with the internal securement surface <b>108</b>, as by an interference fit, the bearing member <b>80</b> is secured to the sleeve <b>100</b>.</p>
    <p>Securing mechanism <b>60</b> further includes an internal securing element in the form of internal seating surface <b>110</b> located on the shell member <b>22</b>, within the cavity <b>30</b> adjacent the lower end <b>34</b> of the shell member <b>22</b>. Internal seating surface <b>110</b> is generally complementary to external seating surface <b>106</b> for mating engagement of the seating surfaces <b>106</b> and <b>110</b>, as seen in FIG. <b>10</b>. The seating surfaces <b>106</b> and <b>110</b> are provided with a tapered configuration, as illustrated by angle A, the taper of the configuration being compatible with the securing characteristics of the material of the sleeve <b>100</b> and the shell member <b>22</b> such that the sleeve <b>100</b> is secured within the shell member <b>22</b> by virtue of the locking of the tapered seating surfaces <b>106</b> and <b>110</b> in response to engagement of the seating surfaces <b>106</b> and <b>110</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the shell member <b>22</b> and the sleeve <b>100</b> are constructed of commercially pure titanium and the angle A is about 6°. Seating surface <b>110</b> includes an upper end <b>112</b> and a lower end <b>114</b> and is divided by the recess <b>62</b> into an upper segment <b>116</b> and a lower segment <b>118</b> (see FIG. <b>4</b>). By placing the recess <b>62</b> essentially midway between the upper end <b>112</b> and the lower end <b>114</b>, engagement of the seating surfaces <b>106</b> and <b>110</b>, and the locking of the seating surfaces <b>106</b> and <b>110</b> in response to such engagement, is facilitated by virtue of the locking being accomplished along segments <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> having generally the same, and therefore maximized, axial length. In this manner, the effectiveness of the seating surface <b>110</b> in assuring appropriate alignment between the sleeve <b>100</b> and the shell member <b>22</b> as the sleeve <b>100</b> is inserted into the shell member <b>22</b> and in subsequently attaining the desired locking engagement with seating surface <b>106</b> is not compromised by the presence of the recess <b>62</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIGS. 11 through 13, should the surgeon desire to employ another material as a bearing material in the acetabular cup assembly <b>20</b>, another alternative bearing member constructed of that material is available in the aforesaid kit of component parts for securement within the shell member <b>22</b>. Thus, alternate bearing member <b>120</b> is constructed of another metal, such as, for example, a cobalt-chrome alloy. Bearing member <b>120</b> includes a generally domed exterior portion <b>122</b> which extends to a top <b>124</b>. A bearing socket <b>126</b> extends upwardly into the bearing member <b>120</b> and provides a spherical bearing surface <b>128</b> for a complementary femoral head (not shown). Bearing member <b>120</b> is provided with an external receptor element in the form of an external securing surface <b>130</b>. Here again, securing mechanism <b>60</b> includes a metallic securing member shown in the form of a sleeve <b>140</b> having an annular ring portion <b>142</b> and a domed portion <b>144</b>. The domed portion <b>144</b> is essentially complementary to the counterpart portion of the inner cavity <b>30</b> of the shell member <b>22</b>, and the ring portion <b>142</b> is provided with an external securing element in the form of an external seating surface <b>146</b> and an internal receptor element in the form of an internal securement surface <b>148</b>.</p>
    <p>The configuration of the internal securement surface <b>148</b> and the configuration of the external securement surface <b>130</b> are compatible with the particular securing characteristics of the material of the bearing member <b>120</b> so that upon engagement of the external securement surface <b>130</b> with the internal securement surface <b>148</b>, the bearing member <b>120</b> is secured to the sleeve <b>140</b> in response to such engagement and seating of the sleeve <b>140</b> on the bearing member <b>120</b>. To that end, the securement surfaces <b>130</b> and <b>148</b> are tapered at an angle B which effects a secure lock between the bearing member <b>120</b> and the sleeve <b>140</b>. The sleeve <b>140</b>, in turn, is secured within the shell member <b>22</b> by the lock effected between the seating surfaces <b>146</b> and <b>110</b>. In the preferred embodiment, sleeve <b>140</b> and shell member <b>22</b> both are constructed of commercially pure titanium and the seating surfaces <b>146</b> and <b>110</b> are tapered at angle A, compatible with the securing characteristics of the material of sleeve <b>140</b> and shell member <b>22</b>, as described above in connection with sleeve <b>100</b>. In this manner, the shell member <b>22</b> is able to receive any selected one of a plurality of bearing members constructed of different materials, such as bearing members <b>24</b>, <b>80</b> and <b>120</b>, furnished in the aforesaid kit, with securement of the selected bearing member being effected either pre-operatively or interoperatively with ease, accuracy and minimal effort on the part of the surgeon, and without the necessity for complex special instruments.</p>
    <p>Turning now to FIG. 14, where it is desired to select a particular position of the bearing surface of a bearing member relative to a shell member within which the bearing member is to be secured, utilizing a metallic securing member in the form of a sleeve constructed in accordance with the present invention, alternate sleeves are provided in which the relative location of the internal receptor element and the external securing element of the sleeve differ from sleeve to sleeve. Thus, in an alternate sleeve <b>150</b>, the internal receptor element includes an internal securement surface <b>152</b> having a central axis <b>154</b> which extends in a longitudinal direction, the external securing element includes an external seating surface <b>156</b> having a central axis <b>158</b> which extends in a longitudinal direction, and the central axis <b>154</b> is offset laterally from the central axis <b>158</b>, as seen at <b>159</b>. A desired position of the bearing surface of a bearing member is attained by selecting a sleeve <b>150</b> having a particular offset <b>159</b>.</p>
    <p>A desired orientation of the bearing surface of a bearing member is attained by selecting a sleeve which provides that orientation. As seen in FIG. 15, an alternate sleeve <b>160</b> includes an internal securement surface <b>162</b> having a central axis <b>164</b> which extends in a longitudinal direction, the external securing element includes an external seating surface <b>166</b> having a central axis <b>168</b> which extends in a longitudinal direction, and the central axis <b>164</b> makes an acute angle <b>169</b> with the central axis <b>168</b> such that the selection of the magnitude of angle <b>169</b> results in a concomitant selection of the relative orientation of the surfaces <b>162</b> and <b>166</b>. A desired orientation of the bearing surface of a bearing member is attained by selecting a sleeve <b>160</b> having a particular angle <b>169</b>.</p>
    <p>It will be understood that the selected positioning and the selected orientation described in connection with sleeves <b>150</b> and <b>160</b> are illustrative examples only. Various combinations of positioning and orientation, as well as other positions and orientations, are available by modifying the configuration of the metallic securing member to accommodate the desired positioning and orientation of the bearing surface of a particular bearing member.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIGS. 16 through 18, another embodiment of the invention is illustrated in the form of acetabular cup assembly <b>200</b>. Acetabular cup assembly <b>200</b> includes a shell component in the form of metallic shell member <b>212</b> and a bearing insert which, in this instance, is in the form of a plastic bearing member <b>214</b>. Shell member <b>212</b> has an outer surface <b>216</b> having a profile configuration which enables the shell member <b>212</b> to be seated and fixed in place within an appropriately prepared acetabulum in a now well-known manner. An inner cavity <b>220</b> extends upwardly into shell member <b>212</b>, from a lower opening <b>222</b> at a lower end <b>224</b> toward an upper end <b>226</b>. Rim segments <b>228</b> are located at the lower end <b>224</b>, and fingers <b>230</b> depend from the rim segments <b>228</b>, the preferred number of fingers <b>230</b> being four, spaced apart at ninety degrees from one another, for purposes to be set forth in detail below.</p>
    <p>Bearing member <b>214</b> has a generally domed exterior <b>240</b> which is essentially complementary to the cavity <b>220</b> of the shell member <b>212</b> and extends longitudinally from a base <b>242</b> to a top <b>244</b>. A basal flange <b>246</b> extends circumferentially around the base <b>242</b> of the bearing member <b>214</b> and projects laterally outwardly to provide a transverse bearing face <b>248</b> at the base <b>242</b> of the bearing member <b>214</b>. A bearing socket <b>250</b> extends upwardly into the bearing member <b>214</b> and provides a spherical bearing surface <b>252</b> for a complementary femoral head (not shown). Basal flange <b>246</b> includes an upper lateral surface <b>254</b>.</p>
    <p>Acetabular cup assembly <b>200</b> is to be implanted in stages; that is, the shell member <b>212</b> and the bearing member <b>214</b> are to be assembled interoperatively, so as to enable appropriate sizing, placement and orientation of the bearing socket <b>250</b>, based upon a pre-operative assessment or upon an evaluation of conditions encountered at the site of the implant. To that end, alternate bearing members <b>214</b> are made available, the alternate bearing members <b>214</b> providing corresponding bearing sockets <b>250</b> placed at different locations and orientations, relative to the seated and secured shell member <b>212</b>, any one of which bearing sockets <b>250</b> then being capable of securement in place in the shell member <b>212</b>, interoperatively, with the bearing surface <b>252</b> appropriately located and oriented for accommodating the needs of the patient. Thus, a kit of component parts which include a plurality of bearing members is made available for the selection of an appropriate bearing member <b>214</b>.</p>
    <p>A selected bearing member <b>214</b> is secured in place appropriately within the shell member <b>212</b> by means of a securing mechanism <b>260</b> provided adjacent the lower end <b>224</b> of the shell member <b>212</b> and adjacent the base <b>242</b> of the bearing member <b>214</b>. Turning now to FIGS. 19 and 20, as well as to FIGS. 16 through 18, securing mechanism <b>260</b> is seen to include a securing element in the form of an annular recess <b>262</b> extending laterally outwardly into the shell member <b>212</b> adjacent the lower end <b>234</b>. a complementary securing element in the form of an annular rib <b>264</b> extends laterally outwardly from the bearing member <b>214</b>, adjacent the base <b>242</b> of the bearing member <b>214</b>. A preferred material for the plastic bearing member <b>214</b> is an ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene commonly used in connection with such bearing members, the securing characteristics of which material include a resiliency sufficient to assure that upon inserting the bearing member <b>214</b> into the shell member <b>212</b>, and seating the bearing member <b>214</b> in the shell member <b>212</b>, as seen in FIG. 20, the annular rib <b>264</b> is seated within the annular recess <b>262</b> to secure the bearing member <b>214</b> within the shell member <b>212</b>.</p>
    <p>In order to assure the attainment of the desired orientation of the bearing member <b>214</b> within the shell member <b>212</b>, prior to securement by virtue of the rib <b>264</b> entering the annular recess <b>262</b>, depending fingers <b>230</b> will preclude complete insertion of the bearing member <b>214</b> into the shell member <b>212</b> by abutting the upper lateral surface <b>254</b> of flange <b>246</b> when the bearing member <b>214</b> is in the longitudinal position shown in FIG. <b>19</b> and the bearing member <b>214</b> is not in the desired orientation. Upon rotation of the bearing member <b>214</b> into the desired orientation, notches <b>266</b> in the flange <b>246</b> are registered with corresponding fingers <b>230</b>. The notches <b>266</b> are configured for allowing the fingers <b>230</b> to enter the notches <b>266</b>, thereby permitting full engagement of the bearing member <b>214</b> within the shell member <b>212</b> upon proper orientation of the bearing member <b>214</b> relative to the shell member <b>212</b>. Upon such full engagement of the bearing member <b>214</b> within the shell member <b>212</b>, sharp edges <b>267</b> on the fingers <b>230</b> are embedded within the material of bearing member <b>214</b>, as shown at <b>268</b>, for precluding micromotions between the bearing member <b>214</b> and the shell member <b>212</b>. A small clearance at <b>269</b>, between portions of the upper lateral surface <b>254</b> and corresponding confronting portions of the lower end <b>224</b> of the shell member <b>212</b>, provide purchases for any desired subsequent removal of the bearing member <b>214</b> from the shell member <b>212</b>.</p>
    <p>Turning now to FIG. 21, rib <b>264</b> is provided with a cross-sectional profile contour configuration <b>270</b> for facilitating engagement of the rib <b>264</b> within the recess <b>262</b>, while effecting an enhanced connection between the bearing member <b>214</b> and the shell member <b>212</b>. Profile contour configuration <b>270</b> includes an upper section <b>272</b> confronting the top <b>244</b> at the upper end of the bearing member <b>214</b>, a lower section <b>274</b> confronting the base <b>242</b> at the lower end of the bearing member <b>214</b>, and an intermediate section <b>276</b> extending between the upper and lower sections <b>272</b> and <b>274</b>. The upper section <b>272</b> makes an acute angle <b>280</b> with axial direction <b>282</b>, and the lower section <b>274</b> makes an obtuse angle <b>284</b> with the axial direction <b>282</b>. The intermediate section <b>276</b> makes an acute angle <b>286</b> with the axial direction <b>282</b>, the acute angle <b>286</b> being smaller than the acute angle <b>260</b> so as to establish tapered surfaces <b>290</b> and <b>292</b> along the upper and intermediate sections <b>272</b> and <b>276</b>, respectively, while the obtuse angle <b>284</b> establishes a locking surface <b>294</b> along the lower section <b>274</b>. The tapered surfaces <b>290</b> and <b>292</b> facilitate the engagement of rib <b>264</b> within recess <b>262</b> during assembly and the locking surface <b>294</b> retains the rib <b>264</b> within the recess <b>262</b> once assembly is complete. The overall profile contour configuration <b>270</b> maximizes the area <b>296</b> at the root <b>298</b> of the rib <b>264</b> so that the resistance to shear of the material of the bearing member <b>214</b> at the root <b>298</b> of the rib <b>264</b> is maximized. At the same time, a sharp edge <b>300</b> which extends along the recess <b>262</b>, engages the rib <b>264</b> at the locking surface <b>294</b>, as illustrated at <b>302</b>, to preclude micromotions between the bearing member <b>214</b> and the shell member <b>212</b>.</p>
    <p>Again, should the surgeon determine, either on the basis of a pre-operative assessment of a patient or during the course of the implant procedure, that based upon the needs of a particular patient, as determined by the pre-operative assessment or by an evaluation of conditions encountered at the particular implant site, a bearing material having characteristics other than those of the material of bearing member <b>214</b> would be more appropriate, acetabular cup assembly <b>200</b> provides the surgeon with the ability to choose, from a kit of component parts providing a plurality of bearing members, a bearing member having a bearing material which exhibits characteristics more appropriate to the needs of that particular patient. Thus, as seen in FIGS. 22 through 25, an alternate bearing member <b>310</b> is constructed of a ceramic material and includes a generally domed exterior portion <b>312</b> which extends to a top <b>314</b>. A bearing socket <b>316</b> extends upwardly into the bearing member <b>310</b> and provides a spherical bearing surface <b>318</b> for a complementary femoral head <b>320</b> of the proximal end <b>322</b> of a femoral component <b>324</b>.</p>
    <p>As in the embodiment described above in connection with FIGS. 7 through 10, bearing member <b>310</b> is provided with an external receptor element in the form of a generally cylindrical securement surface <b>330</b> which extends essentially parallel to central axis C of the bearing member <b>310</b>, between lower end <b>332</b> of the bearing member <b>310</b> and the domed exterior portion <b>312</b>. In order to enable simplified interoperative securement of the bearing member <b>310</b> within shell member <b>212</b>, subsequent to locating and seating shell member <b>212</b> within the acetabulum, securing mechanism <b>260</b> provides appropriate mating tapered surfaces. Thus, securing mechanism <b>260</b> includes a metallic securing member shown in the form of a sleeve <b>340</b> having an annular ring portion <b>342</b> adjacent a lower end <b>344</b> and a domed portion <b>346</b> extending between the ring portion <b>342</b> and an upper end <b>348</b>. The domed portion <b>346</b> is to be received within the counterpart portion of the inner cavity <b>220</b> of the shell member <b>212</b>, and the ring portion <b>342</b> is provided with an external securing element in the form of an external seating surface <b>350</b> and an internal receptor element in the form of a generally cylindrical internal securement surface <b>352</b>. The configuration of the internal securement surface <b>352</b> and the configuration of the external securement surface <b>330</b> are compatible with the particular characteristics of the material of the bearing member <b>310</b> so that upon engagement of the external securement surface <b>330</b> with the internal securement surface <b>352</b>, as by an interference fit, the bearing member <b>310</b> is secured to the sleeve <b>340</b>.</p>
    <p>Securing mechanism <b>260</b> further includes an internal securing element in the form of internal seating surface <b>354</b> located on the shell member <b>212</b>, within the cavity <b>220</b> adjacent the lower end <b>224</b> of the shell member <b>212</b>. Internal seating surface <b>354</b> is generally complementary to external seating surface <b>350</b> for mating engagement of the seating surfaces <b>350</b> and <b>354</b>, as seen in FIG. <b>24</b>. The seating surfaces <b>350</b> and <b>354</b> are provided with a tapered configuration, as illustrated by angle <b>356</b>, the taper of the configuration being compatible with the securing characteristics of the material of the sleeve <b>340</b> and the shell member <b>212</b> such that the sleeve <b>340</b> is secured within the shell member <b>212</b> by virtue of the locking of the tapered seating surfaces <b>350</b> and <b>354</b> in response to engagement of the seating surfaces <b>350</b> and <b>354</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the shell member <b>212</b> and the sleeve <b>340</b> are constructed of commercially pure titanium and the angle <b>356</b> is about <b>60</b>. Seating surface <b>354</b> includes an upper end <b>360</b> and a lower end <b>362</b> and is divided by the recess <b>262</b> into an upper segment <b>364</b> and a lower segment <b>366</b>. By placing the recess <b>262</b> essentially midway between the upper end <b>360</b> and the lower end <b>362</b>, engagement of the seating surfaces <b>350</b> and <b>354</b>, and the locking of the seating surfaces <b>350</b> and <b>354</b> in response to such engagement is facilitated, by virtue of the locking being accomplished along segments <b>364</b> and <b>366</b> having generally the same, and therefore maximized, axial length. In this manner, the effectiveness of the seating surface <b>354</b> in assuring appropriate alignment between the sleeve <b>340</b> and the shell <b>212</b> as the sleeve <b>340</b> is inserted into the shell <b>212</b> and in subsequently attaining the desired locking engagement with seating surface <b>350</b> is not compromised by the presence of the recess <b>262</b>.</p>
    <p>A flange <b>370</b> extends laterally outwardly from the lower end <b>344</b> of the sleeve <b>340</b>. In order to assure the attainment of the desired orientation of the sleeve <b>340</b>, and the bearing member <b>310</b>, within the shell member <b>212</b>, prior to securement by virtue of the full seating of the sleeve <b>340</b> and bearing member <b>310</b>, depending fingers <b>230</b> will preclude complete insertion of the sleeve <b>340</b> into the shell member <b>212</b> by abutting upper lateral surface <b>372</b> of flange <b>370</b> when the sleeve <b>340</b> is in the longitudinal position shown in FIG. <b>23</b> and the sleeve <b>340</b> is not in the desired orientation. Upon rotation of the sleeve <b>340</b> into the desired orientation, notches <b>376</b> in the flange <b>370</b> are registered with corresponding fingers <b>230</b>. The notches <b>376</b> are configured for allowing the fingers <b>230</b> to enter the notches <b>376</b>, thereby permitting full engagement of the sleeve <b>340</b>, and bearing member <b>310</b>, within the shell member <b>212</b> upon proper orientation and axial alignment of the sleeve <b>340</b> relative to the shell member <b>212</b>. A small clearance at <b>378</b>, between portions of the upper lateral surface <b>372</b> and corresponding confronting portions of the lower end <b>224</b> of the shell member <b>212</b>, provide purchases for any desired subsequent removal of the bearing member <b>310</b> from the shell member <b>212</b>.</p>
    <p>As best seen in FIG. 25, as well as in FIGS. 23 and 24, the lower end <b>332</b> of the bearing member <b>310</b> is spaced upwardly from the lower end <b>344</b> of the sleeve <b>340</b> a prescribed distance <b>380</b>. With the femoral head <b>320</b> of the femoral component <b>324</b> engaged in the bearing surface <b>318</b> of the bearing member <b>310</b>, rotational movement of the proximal end <b>322</b> of the femoral component <b>324</b> is limited by engagement of neck <b>382</b> of the femoral component <b>324</b> with the lower end <b>344</b> of the sleeve <b>340</b>, as illustrated at <b>384</b>. In this manner, impingement of the proximal end <b>322</b> of the femoral component <b>324</b> upon the bearing member <b>310</b> is precluded, thus eliminating a potential source of damage to the bearing member <b>310</b> when the acetabular cup assembly <b>200</b> is in service.</p>
    <p>In the modification illustrated in FIG. 26, the lower end of the sleeve <b>340</b> is modified, as shown at <b>390</b>, to receive a ring-like cushion <b>392</b> affixed to the lower end <b>390</b>, the cushion <b>392</b> being constructed of a resilient synthetic polymeric material, the cushion <b>392</b> thus being interposed between the lower end of the sleeve <b>340</b> and the proximal end <b>322</b> of the femoral component <b>324</b> so as essentially to absorb shock connected with engagement of the proximal end <b>322</b> of the femoral component <b>324</b> with the sleeve <b>340</b>.</p>
    <p>It will be seen that acetabular cup assemblies <b>20</b> and <b>200</b> provide a surgeon with a wide range of choices for a pre-operative or an interoperative selection of characteristics of the bearing member of the acetabular cup assembly, with simplicity and lowered cost. Such characteristics include material, size, positioning and orientation. As such, the present invention attains the several objects and advantages summarized above, namely: Accommodates a wide choice of bearing materials in the bearing member of an acetabular cup assembly, while utilizing a common acetabular shell; enables the choice of size, position and orientation of the bearing surface of a bearing member selected for assembly with a particular acetabular shell; increases the range of bearing materials, as well as bearing size, positioning and orientation, and renders the choices available in a practical manner for either pre-operative or interoperative selection; allows a surgeon greater latitude in accommodating the needs of different patients while meeting the requirements imposed by various conditions encountered at a particular implant site, and enables appropriate choices to be made interoperatively, as well as pre-operatively; promotes greater accuracy in the replacement of a natural hip joint, with increased economy; provides a surgeon with the ability to make both pre-operative choices and interoperative choices from a wider range of options; enables the securement of a bearing member of selected material within a common acetabular shell, with increased ease and economy, and without complex, specialized instruments; provides an acetabular cup assembly having a bearing member of appropriate bearing material and accurate sizing, positioning and orientation, with economy of manufacture and use, and long-term reliability.</p>
    <p>It is to be understood that the above detailed description of preferred embodiments of the invention is provided by way of example only. Various details of design, construction and procedure may be modified without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention, as set forth in the appended claims.</p>
