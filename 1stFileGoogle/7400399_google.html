    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="p-0004">The present invention relates generally to the field of optical filters and sensors. More particularly, it concerns the use of the guided-mode resonance effect occurring through the use of waveguide gratings attached to the endfaces of waveguides such as optical fibers in fields such as optical sensing and communications.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">2. Description of Related Art</p>
    <p num="p-0006">Resonance anomalies occurring in waveguide gratings (WGGs) have been the subject of current interest for spectral filtering applications [Magnusson and Wang, 1992; Wang and Magnusson, 1993; Wang and Magnusson, 1994; Shin et al., 1998; Tibuleac and Magnusson, 1997; Tibuleac, et al., 2000; Wawro, et al., 2000; Avrutsky, et al., 1989; Boye and Kostuk, 1999; and Rosenblatt, et al., 1997]. Guided-mode resonances (GMRs) occurring in subwavelength WGGs admitting only zero-order propagating diffraction orders yield spectral filters with unique properties such as peak reflectances approaching 100%, narrow linewidths, and low sidebands. Filter characteristics, such as center wavelength, linewidth and sideband behavior, are defined by the waveguide-grating parameters, such as grating period, grating profile, refractive indices, layer thicknesses, and grating fill factor.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">Changes in any parameters of the diffractive structure can result in a responsive shift of the reflected or transmitted wavelength band. In general, for spectral filtering applications, the most stable GMR structure is sought to prevent an unwanted resonance shift due to small parameter fluctuations. However, for spectroscopic sensing applications, it is desirable to enhance the resonance instability to create a device that will respond to very small parameter changes. This type of device can be utilized, for example, to detect very small changes in the refractive index or thickness of a media being evaluated in biomedical, industrial or environmental sensing applications. Implementation of the guided-mode resonance effect for optical sensing using planar waveguide grating structures and free-space propagating incident waves has been proposed in previous publications [Wang and Magnusson, 1993; Shin et al., 1998].</p>
    <p num="p-0008">Experimental fabrication of waveguide gratings utilizing the GMR effect has primarily been restricted to planar WGGs with an incident beam that is propagating in free space. Experimental results for 1-D grating GMR filters incorporate single layer and multilayer reflection filter designs, including a TM polarization reflection filter utilizing the Brewster effect [Magnusson, et al., 1998]. Double layer GMR filter efficiencies as high as 98.5% have been reported by Liu, et al. for TE incident polarization [Liu, et al., 1998]. GMR crossed grating structures (2-D grating filters) have been experimentally fabricated by Peng and Morris [Peng and Morris, 1996], with a reported filter efficiency of 60%. Norton et al. [Norton, et al., 1998] investigated the dependence of lineshape and tunability in central wavelength and resonant angle position on grating parameters.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">Chen [Chen, 1988] reports a theoretical design incorporating a diffraction grating on an optical fiber endface that is used to excite higher order modes in multimode optical fibers. Wang et al. [Wang, et al., 1995] reports a fiber optic proximity sensor design incorporating a diffraction grating on a fiber endface. However, the diffraction gratings reported in these two references do not have waveguide properties, and, consequently, do not exhibit the GMR effect.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">A biosensor is an analytical device that integrates an immobilized biologically sensitive material (analyte), such as enzyme, antibody, DNA, cells, or organic molecules, with an electrochemical, piezoelectric, optical or acoustic transducer to convert a biochemical response into a signal for measurement, interpretation, or control. Electrochemical and optical sensors are most widely used. Optical biosensors can provide fast, accurate, and safe analyte detection. Current fiber-optic sensor technology applies fluorescence, total internal reflection, intensity reflection, and surface-plasmon resonances.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect, is a widely used optical detection method that is highly sensitive to changes in the optical properties (refractive index, monolayer thickness) at the sensor surface. The term surface plasmon (SP) refers to an electromagnetic field charge-density oscillation that can occur at the surface of a conductor. An SP mode can be resonantly excited by parallel-polarized (TM) incident light. Conventional surface plasmon sensors include a prism or diffraction grating for phase matching of the incident and SP waves; commercial systems employ bulk optical components. Fiber-optic SPR sensors have been reported; in these a metal sleeve is deposited on the side of the fiber to which the analyte is contacted. A drawback of the SPR technology is the inherently large linewidth; typically Δλ˜50 nm. Therefore, a sensor utilizing the GMR effect that would provide smaller linewidths would exhibit a significant resolution dynamic-range advantage over SPR sensors.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0012">In one respect, the invention is a waveguide grating device. The device includes at least one waveguide that has an end, and the end has an endface. As used herein, “waveguide” means any device possessing a structure capable of confining optical energy. As used herein, “endface” means a face on the end of a waveguide that may be oriented at any angle with respect to a wave being propagated through the waveguide. The device also includes a waveguide grating fabricated on the endface of the at least one waveguide. The waveguide grating has at least one waveguide layer and at least one grating layer. As used herein, “grating layer” includes any suitable layer possessing a grating. The gratings on the present grating layers include surface-relief type gratings (e.g., those in which the amplitude of the grating may be modulated) and volume gratings (e.g., those in which the refractive index of the grating may be modulated). The periodicity of the gratings of the present grating layers may be varied and/or their modulation depth (amplitude or index) may be varied. The grating may be nonuniform. As used herein, “waveguide layer” includes any suitable layer possessing a structure capable of confining optical energy. Throughout the present disclosure, including the claims, waveguide layers are distinct from the waveguides on which they are fabricated. The at least one waveguide layer and the at least one grating layer may be the same layer.</p>
    <p num="p-0013">In other respects, the at least one waveguide may be a fiber. The at least one waveguide may possess any suitable shape, including elliptical. The shape may be rectangular. The at least one waveguide may be a channel waveguide. The at least one waveguide may be cylindrical in shape. The at least one waveguide may be a slab waveguide. The at least one waveguide may be a ridge waveguide. The at least one grating layer may include a dielectric material. The at least one grating layer may include a glass. The at least one grating layer may include a polymer. The at least one grating layer may include a solid or liquid crystalline material. The at least one grating layer may include a semiconductor material. The at least one grating layer may include a photorefractive material. The at least one waveguide layer may include a dielectric material. The at least one waveguide layer may include a glass. The at least one waveguide layer may include a polymer. The at least one waveguide layer may include a solid or liquid crystalline material. The at least one waveguide layer may include a semiconductor material. The at least one waveguide layer may include a photorefractive material. The at least one grating layer and the at least one waveguide layer may be the same layer. The at least one grating layer and the at least one waveguide layer may be different layers in contact with each other. The waveguide grating may also include at least a third layer in contact with the at least one waveguide layer, the at least one grating layer, or both the at least one waveguide layer and the at least one grating layer. The at least third layer may be a buffer layer, which may be formed from any material suitable for forming either the at least one waveguide layer or the at least one grating layer, and which may be formed using the same techniques that may be used to form either the at least one waveguide layer or the at least one grating layer.</p>
    <p num="p-0014">As a buffer layer, the at least third layer may be made of a dielectric and may serve to shape the spectral reflection of the waveguide grating, such as to lower the sidebands, shift the resonance to a desired wavelength, or narrow or widen the linewidth of the GMR. The buffer layer may serve as neither a waveguide layer nor a grating layer. The at least third layer may also be formed of metal, which in some embodiments, may serve a buffer layer intermediate two layers of the waveguide grating that do not otherwise attach well to one another. In other embodiments, the at least third layer (made from either a dielectric or a metal, for example), may be the layer of the waveguide grating in contact with a substance to be sensed/evaluated. In some cases, the substance to be sensed may not attach itself efficiently to dielectric materials composing, at least in part, the waveguide grating. The use of a third layer that is thin may facilitate the attachment of substances being sensed. In still other embodiments, such as biomedical applications, an organic substance being sensed may attach itself only to other organic substances, and not to dielectric or metallic layers of the waveguide grating. In such situations, the use of a third layer (metallic, for example) may be used to which another (fourth) organic layer could be attached. The organic substance being sensed could then attach itself to such a fourth organic layer. The at least third layer may be distinct from both the at least one waveguide and grating layers. The waveguide grating may also include at least a third layer in contact with the at least one grating layer, and may include an arbitrarily large number of layers, each of which may be either additional waveguide layers, additional grating layers, or additional buffer layers.</p>
    <p num="p-0015">In another respect, the invention is a system for spectral filtering and the system utilizes a guided-mode resonance effect in a waveguide. The guided-mode resonance effect is described below in greater detail. The system includes a waveguide grating device. The waveguide grating device includes at least one waveguide that has a proximal end and a distal end. The distal end of the at least one waveguide has an endface.

Also, the permittivity of the at least one waveguide layer and one of the permittivities of the at least one permittivity of the at least one grating layer may be the same.</p>
    <p num="p-0016">In other respects, the system may also include a source coupled to the proximal end of the at least one waveguide for propagating a signal through the at least one waveguide. After the signal is propagated, it contacts the waveguide grating and is reflected from the waveguide grating in whole or in part, or transmitted through the waveguide grating in whole in or in part, depending at least partially upon the plurality of variable parameters. The source may be a broadband source. The source may be a white light. The source may be a light emitting diode. The source may be a laser. The source may be a continuous wave source. The source may be a pulsed source. The source may be polarized. The source may be unpolarized. The source may be an incoherent light source. The source may be a coherent light source.

Semiconductor detectors are power detectors commonly used in the detection of continuous wave sources ranging from about 160 nm to about 1800 nm wavelengths (e.g., visible range to infrared). The photodetector may include a pyroelectric material. The photodetector may include the human eye.</p>

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p num="p-0049">Disclosed herein is a new GMR device that includes a waveguide having an end that has an endface and a waveguide grating fabricated on the endface. As defined above, waveguides include fibers such as optical, single-mode, multi-mode, polarization-maintaining, graded-index, step-index, nonlinear core (either with or without embedded electrodes), polymer, phototonic crystal waveguides and fibers, glass, crystal-core, and chalcogenide fibers; waveguides with shapes such as rectangular, elliptical and cylindrical; slab waveguides and ridge waveguides. The waveguide grating is made up of at least one waveguide layer and at least one grating layer, and the grating and waveguide layers may be the same layer. The layers, if separate, may be arranged in any suitable fashion with respect to each other and the waveguide. A source may propagate an incident signal, such as a broad-spectrum signal, through the waveguide, the waveguide may guide the signal to the waveguide grating, and the waveguide grating, depending on its design, may filter the signal to reflect or transmit a desired spectral band of the signal. Used as a filter, characteristics such as center wavelength (the wavelength at which a peak or a notch is exhibited in the spectrum of the reflected or transmitted wave), linewidth (the width of the spectral peak or notch) and sideband (reflectance or transmittance in the spectral region outside the peak or notch spectral region) are defined by certain waveguide-grating parameters, such as the periodic structure of the grating layer(s), the refractive indices of the layer(s) forming the waveguide grating, the thicknesses of those layers, and the fill factor of the grating layer(s). The present waveguide grating devices provide a new class of diffractive optical elements as a result of the GMR spectral filters resulting therefrom. Potential applications for the present devices include use as spectral filters for use in fiber optic systems (such as communications), as sensors for high resolution chemical or biochemical sensing, and as integrated polarized reflectors for fiber lasers.</p>
    <p num="p-0050">The phrase guided-mode resonance (GMR) refers to a rapid variation in the diffraction efficiency spectrum of waveguide gratings generally, and those described herein. A resonance occurs when an incident wave from a propagated signal that may include more than one wave is phase matched to a leaky guided mode allowed by a waveguide grating. Phase matching may be accomplished through a diffraction grating, which is inherently polarization sensitive. Resonances occurring in subwavelength waveguide gratings (i.e., waveguide gratings having a grating layer(s) with a period, Λ, less than the wavelength, λ, of the input wave admitting only zero-order propagating diffraction orders, where Λ&lt;λ/n<sub>S</sub>, λ/n<sub>C </sub>where λ/n<sub>S </sub>and λ/n<sub>C </sub>are the wavelengths in the substrate and cover regions respectively, [i.e. regions of propagation of the incident and emerging waves]; λ is the wavelength in vacuum, and n<sub>S </sub>and n<sub>C </sub>are the refractive indices of the substrate and cover regions, respectively) allow complete energy exchange between the forward and backward propagating zero-order waves. In this case, all higher order diffracted waves are evanescent. In fact, when these evanescent waves correspond to waveguide modes supportable by the WGG, the resonance occurs.</p>
    <p num="p-0051">Considering a single layer WGG, for a resonance to occur, the average refractive index of the grating layer, n<sub>av</sub>, is required to be higher than the refractive index of the surrounding cover and it is required to be higher than the refractive index of the substrate. For a multi-layer structure, one of the layers in the stack needs to meet this requirement. The average refractive index of the grating layer may be calculated using the following equation:
<br> <i>n</i> <sub>av</sub> <i>=[n</i> <sub>L</sub> <sup>2</sup> <i>+f</i>(<i>n</i> <sub>H</sub> <sup>2</sup> <i>−n</i> <sub>L</sub> <sup>2</sup>)]<sup>1/2 </sup> </p>
    <p num="p-0052">where n<sub>H </sub>and n<sub>L </sub>are the refractive indices of the high and low-refractive index regions of the grating layer, and f is the fill factor of the grating layer (i.e. the fraction of the grating period occupied by the high-refractive index material). The efficient energy exchange occurs within small ranges of at least one physical parameter of the device, such as the angle of incidence of the input wave or signal, wavelength, thickness of the layers utilized, period of the grating layer(s), and the refractive indices of the grating and waveguide layers and surrounding adjacent media n<sub>f </sub>and n<sub>c</sub>.</p>
    <p num="p-0053">Integration of resonant WGGs with thin-film coatings may provide low sidebands surrounding the resonance regime, achieving high-quality near ideal filter properties. Such filters are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,598,300 to Magnusson and S. S. Wang (1997) (hereinafter the '300 patent), which is hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Generic GMR filters and their many applications are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,216,680 issued to R. Magnusson and S. S. Wang.</p>
    <p num="h-0006">Modeling of the Present Waveguide Grating Devices</p>
    <p num="p-0054">Rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) [Gaylord and Moharam, 1985; Moharam, et al., 1995a; and Moharam, et al., 1995b], all three of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference, is a numerical tool that may be used to accurately model the present waveguide grating devices based on the use of certain known parameters of the waveguide grating. “Modeling,” as used herein, means to determine the spectral characteristics, i.e., the fraction of the incident wave power that is reflected and transmitted through a waveguide grating device at any wavelength of interest. This includes determining the GMR spectral locations, shape, and width of GMR peaks or notches, and reflectance and transmittance in the sidebands (i.e. outside the resonance region). For a rigorous analysis and development of these theories see Magnusson and Wang U.S. Pat. No. 5,216,680, which is hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, and [Wang and Magnusson, 1995], which is also hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. However, a simplified model employing waveguide theory is useful to provide physical insight and approximate resonance locations. This theory is detailed in the '300 patent at col. 5, line 6 through col. 6, line 61 for multi-layer waveguide gratings. For a single-layer waveguide grating, this theory is detailed in the '300 patent at col. 7, lines 7 through 38. The present waveguide gratings may be modeled in a variety of different manners. For example, GMR devices may be modeled using a commercially available software such as Gsolver, from Grating Solver Development Company, which implements RCWA. In addition, waveguide gratings may be modeled using finite difference time domain analysis programs such as TFDS, commercially available from Apollo Photonics, or BEAMPROP FULLWAVE, commercially available from Rsoft. Waveguide gratings may also be suitably modeled using finite element analysis.</p>
    <p num="p-0055">The present waveguide gratings formed from multiple layers may be modeled using RCWA. In using such an analysis, one may assume that the grating layer being analyzed possesses an infinite number of grating periods. In using such an analysis, one may also assume the incident wave or waves are plane waves, and further, one may assume the incidence of the plane waves is normal. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a two-layer TE polarization GMR response resulting from an RCWA in which the foregoing assumptions were made. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a two-layer waveguide grating <b>10</b>, which was analyzed to arrive at the response shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Waveguide grating <b>10</b> may be part of a two-layer reflection filter (having waveguide layer <b>12</b> and grating layer <b>14</b>) designed for an ionic, self-assembled polymer waveguide layer with a photoresist grating layer deposited on the polymer waveguide layer.</p>
    <p num="p-0056">Although the assumption that the number of grating periods is infinite may be made in using RCWA to analyze the present waveguide gratings, the number of such grating periods is finite. However, in recent experiments at microwave wavelengths, RCWA has been demonstrated to accurately predict the GMR spectral locations and lineshapes of finite-size structures [Tibuleac, et al., 2000]. Microwave experiments on GMR filters indicate that finite-size grating layers with as few as twelve periods may yield GMR notch filters with a decrease in the transmittance spectrum from ˜81% outside resonance to ˜2% at resonance. The foregoing GMR filters have, of course, been planar and not fabricated on the end of a waveguide.</p>
    <p num="p-0057">Controlling lineshape parameters such as center wavelength, linewidth, and sideband response may be achieved by carefully selecting the parameters of a waveguide grating device. Low sideband responses (e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may be achieved by choosing the grating layer thickness to be one-fourth of the resonant wavelength. Filter linewidth is affected in part by the strength of the guided-mode confinement and the coupling efficiency of the waveguide grating. As used herein, “mode confinement” means the ratio between the power contained in the core of a mode and the power contained in the core and cladding of a mode. Lineshape may be adjusted by modifying the grating layer fill factor, the grating modulation, and the difference between the average refractive index of the grating layer and the refractive indices of the surrounding regions or media. As used herein, “grating modulation” means the difference between the high and low refractive indices of the grating layer. The filter central wavelength is affected in part by the periodic structure of the grating layer (as used herein, “periodic structure of the grating layer” includes grating layer parameters such as grating period, shape of the gratings, the dimension of the gratings, amplitude, and periodicity of the gratings), the refractive indices of the grating layer, and the refractive index of the waveguide layer (or refractive indices if more than one waveguide layer is utilized within the waveguide grating). Additional parameters that may be manipulated to affect lineshape include the relative spatial phases of incorporated gratings, which may be shifted, and the periodic structures of any grating layers, which may be chosen to be dual-line [Tibuleac, 1996]. As used herein, “dual-line” refers to the presence of two peaks (or notches) in the spectral reflectance (or transmittance) dependence. Since waveguide grating devices are polarization dependent in 1-D (i.e., one-dimensional) grating layers, polarization insensitive devices may be designed by implementing crossed (i.e., 2-D) waveguide gratings.</p>
    <p num="p-0058">The present waveguide grating devices may also be designed an inverse approach if certain properties of the needed GMR device are known. If the properties of the needed GMR device are known, these parameters may serve as input parameters into a search and optimization algorithm such as a genetic algorithm [Goldberg, 1989] employing RCWA to calculate the reflectance and transmittance spectra of the devices during the optimization process. Such methods to design GMR filters have been reported in references [Tibuleac, et al., 1997; Zuffada, et al., 1998; Zuffada, et al., 1999; Tibuleac, 1999]. The use of one such genetic algorithm is disclosed in the Appendix hereto.</p>
    <p num="h-0007">Biomedical/Chemical Sensing</p>
    <p num="p-0059">A biosensor is an analytical device that integrates an immobilized biologically sensitive material, such as enzyme, antibody, DNA, cells, or organic molecules, with an electrochemical, piezoelectric, optical or acoustic transducer to convert a biochemical response into a signal that can be used for measurement, interpretation, or control. Accurate, real-time, direct measurement of biologically related substances eliminates expensive and complex sample preparation that is required in ex situ lab processing. Electrochemical and optical sensors are the most widely used and versatile biosensing methods [Collings and Caruso, 1997; Kersey, 1996]. Optical biosensors provide a fast, accurate, safe, and robust means of analyte detection. All fundamental characteristics of light as it interacts with matter can be used in measurement, including intensity, frequency, phase, and polarization changes. A major advantage of optical detection methods over other techniques is the ability to probe surfaces and films in a non-destructive manner. In addition, optically based sensors are generic elements that can be used to sense a wide variety of analytes that might not be possible with other methods, such as gases, proteins, various types of micro-organisms, and metabolites such as glucose. The use of optical fibers in biosensing systems allows a high degree of geometrical versatility, including component miniaturization, and continuous, real-time, remote monitoring of very small sample domains. Optical fiber sensors are convenient devices that are free from electrical interference and are generally biocompatible for in vivo testing. The ability to provide remote, continuous monitoring is a distinct advantage when testing hazardous materials, in vivo testing, or down-well environmental measurements.</p>
    <p num="p-0060">Current fiber optic sensor technology includes fluorescence [Golden, et al., 1994; Abel, et al., 1996], total internal reflection fiber sensors [Bolin, et al., 1989], reflection intensity [Tugendhaft, et al., 1997; Jin, et al., 1997; Johns, et al., 1998], surface plasmon resonances [Jorgenson and Yee, 1993; Jung, 1997; Furlong, et al., 1996a; Slavik, et al., 1997b; Slavik, et al., 1997a; Slavik, et al., 1998; Homola and Slavik, 1996; De Maria, et al., 1993; Melendez, et al., 1997], and fiber bundle arrays utilizing fluorescent detection materials [Ferguson and Walt, 1997]. While fiber optic sensors are the focus here, there are many other designs in the area of optical sensing. Capillary optical sensors utilize fiber optic couplers and capillary tubes that are chemically modified on the inner surface. Optical absorbance or fluorescence is implemented as the unit of measure. Ellipsometry is used to detect refractive index or thickness changes in biological sensing layers. Sensors utilizing planar optical waveguides [Collings and Caruso, 1997; Melendez, et al., 1996; Sharma and Rogers, 1994] include total internal reflection fluorescence, attenuated total reflectance, reflectomeric interference spectroscopy, as well as thin film devices including the resonant mirror developed by Cush, et al. [Cush, et al., 1993], grating couplers [Sychugov, et al., 1997], and Mach-Zender sensor devices [Luff, et al., 1998]. Fabrication of optical sensor elements using transparent sol-gel, can increase sensor sensitivity [Cunningham, 1998]. The primary advantage of fiber optic sensing over other optical configurations is the real-time, remote operation of the sensor.</p>
    <p num="h-0008">Current Technology</p>
    <p num="p-0061">The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is a widely used optical detection method that is highly sensitive to changes in the optical properties at the sensor surface, such as refractive index or thickness. The term surface plasmon (SP) is based upon an electromagnetic field charge-density oscillation that can occur at the surface of a conductor. When this electromagnetic coupled mode of excitation travels along the interface between a metal and another medium, it is referred to as a surface plasmon. These surface waves are bound to the metal-dielectric interface, with an intensity maximum in the surface and exponentially decaying fields perpendicular to it. An SP mode is resonantly excited by TM polarized incident light if the wavevector of the incident light and the surface plasmon wave are matched, as governed by Maxwell's equations. At resonance, reflected light intensity from the metallic surface goes through a minimum at a defined angle of incidence. Phase matching occurs by employing a metallized diffraction grating, or by using total internal reflection from a high index material, such as in prism coupling or an evanescent field from a guided wave. The propagation constant of the plasmon depends upon the refractive index of the adjacent medium, which is within sensing distance of the surface plasmon field.</p>
    <p num="p-0062">Conventional surface plasmon sensors include a prism or diffraction grating that is used as the phase matching and transducer element. Commercial [Sethi, 1994] planar SPR sensors include Pharmacia Biosensor's BIAcore and BIAlite systems, and Texas Instrument's Spreeta system [Melendez, et al., 1997; Furlong, et al., 1996b; Ouellette, 1998]. Fiber optic SPR sensors developed by Jorgenson and Yee [Jorgenson and Yee, 1993], and more recently by Slavik, et al. [Slavik, et al., 1997b; Slavik, et al., 1997a; Slavik, et al., 1998] and Jung [Jung, 1997] allow remote, real time monitoring. Commercially manufactured fiber SPR sensors are available from Biacore. A sensor based upon SP wave excitation on the tip of an optical fiber was proposed by De Maria, et al. in 1993 [De Maria, et al., 1993].</p>
    <p num="p-0063">A method for fabrication of fiber optic surface plasmon resonance sensors is described by Jorgenson and Yee, and Slavik, et al. This includes removal of the fiber cladding over the sensing region to allow access to the evanescent field of a guided mode. Cladding removal is accomplished by gluing the fiber in a curved slot on a silica block, and subsequently polishing and lapping the cladding to obtain a proximity to the core. The exposed region is covered with a thin layer of gold in order to support an SP wave, with the sensing layer attached at the outer interface. If the two modes are closely phase matched, a guided TM mode in the fiber can excite an SP wave at the outer metal-sensing layer interface, resulting in a detectable minimum in the transmitted light intensity. The wavelength where this intensity minimum occurs is closely dependent on the refractive index of the medium adjacent to the metallic film (sensing layer). Variations in the sensing layer, such as refractive index or thickness, can be detected by monitoring changes in the output intensity. To attain maximum sensitivity, appropriate metal layer and cladding thicknesses must be chosen. Optimizing the sensor sensitivity by increasing metallic layer thickness and decreasing the remaining fiber cladding thickness results in a decrease of the dynamic range of the sensor. To tune the refractive index operation range of the SPR fiber optic sensor, a thin tantalum pentoxide overlayer can be deposited beneath the sensing layer.</p>
    <p num="p-0064">Slavik details two modes of operation for the fiber optic SPR sensor [Slavik, et al., 1997a]. In the spectral mode, the output power is monitored as a function of wavelength to indicate an SPR spectral location. A tunable laser or a white light source can be used in this configuration. Experimentally achieved sensor resolutions operating in the spectral mode are reported to be 1.6*10<sup>−5 </sup>RIU (refractive index units) for an index range of 1.3952-1.3973. This is based on a spectroscopic resolution of 0.1 nm, and does not account for the lineshape characteristics of the sensor response. In the more widely reported amplitude mode, the output power is monitored at a fixed wavelength. The relative output intensity is detected as a refractive index or thickness change causes a shift towards or away from a resonance location. Small changes in the transmitted intensity are measured and calibrated to a specific refractive index or thickness change. Resolutions for the amplitude mode are reported as low as 9×10<sup>−6 </sup>RIU for an index range of 1.4105-1.4163, assuming an optoelectronic system that can resolve changes in optical power to 1%. A particular intensity response provides two solutions for a change in refractive index or thickness; one going towards the resonance dip and one away from it. The resolutions reported are based on an experimentally determined resonance shift of approximately 12 nm with a 80 nm linewidth for a refractive index change from 1.3952 to 1.3973. To perform remote, real-time measurements with this sensor, an aluminum mirror must be deposited on the fiber endface to redirect the output light.</p>
    <p num="p-0065">Other fiber sensors include fluorescent excitation and detection in the evanescent field of an optical fiber. As the evanescent field extends to the cladding sensing region, fluorophores coated on the outside of the fiber are excited. Depending on the biological material that is being sensed, a particular wavelength of light indicating a biological recognition can be captured by the fiber optic probe and analyzed using spectroscopic detection elements. This requires very sensitive detection equipment such as photomultiplier tubes since the captured signal is very weak. Accuracy and repeatability is an inherent weakness for this device. Furthermore, detection applications are limited by the bioselective agents available.</p>
    <p num="h-0009">Advantages of the Present Waveguide Grating Devices Over Current Technology</p>
    <p num="p-0066">Comparison of biosensor performance is best accomplished through a figure of merit [Cunningham, 1998]. Device characterizations that can be included in a generic figure of merit include sensor sensitivity, resolution, and dynamic range. The sensitivity of a biosensor is defined as the measured response for a particular amount of material that is detected. For example, a GMR resonance shift of 11 nm for a thickness change of 20 nm results in a sensitivity value of 0.55 nm shift per 1 nm material added. However, the sensitivity value does not consider sensor limitations; rather, it indicates the maximum achievable sensitivity to the analyte being detected. Resolution of the sensor includes the realistic component limitations such as spectroscopic equipment resolutions, power meter sensitivities, bioselective agent response, and linewidth considerations. The lineshape response has a great impact on the accuracy of spectroscopic sensors in distinguishing between wavelength shifts. For highest confidence limits, the resolution for resonant sensors can be defined by the linewidth (full width, half maximum power), assuming the equipment has a higher resolution. For example, the refractive index sensor depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> has a maximum resolution of 3*10<sup>−4 </sup>RIU, when considering only spectroscopic resolution limitations of 0.1 nm. However, the detected response is limited by the linewidth of the device, which is 0.8 nm in this case. Under this criteria, the smallest RIU change that can be accurately detected with this sensor is 4*10<sup>−3</sup>, although the sensitivity is higher. By normalizing the resonance shift with the linewidth, a realistic evaluation of a resonance sensor performance can be determined. A comparison of sensor sensitivity, resolution and dynamic range is included below in Table 1. The dynamic range (or usable range) of a sensor is defined as the range where discrimination between responses can be detected. Materials used in fabrication and the sensing medium generally limit this range. In addition, these three parameters are generally inter-related. For example, for SPR sensors, as the operational range of refractive index values that can be detected is increased, the sensor sensitivity decreases. available for detection in the present devices. Accordingly, accuracy and reliability of the present devices is greatly enhanced over other sensors types, since each polarization can act as a reference for the other. In addition, it may be possible to obtain actual refractive index and thickness values of the sensed medium since two measured values are obtained. In contrast to that which may be achieved using the present devices, for sensors that utilize only TM polarization, such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors, the refractive index of the sensed medium or the sensed layer thickness must be determined beforehand, since both parameters cannot be determined from the same measurement.</p>
    <p num="p-0067">Current fiber optic sensors, including the SPR, require the sensing region to be along the length of the fiber, which increases fabrication complexity and spatial sensing resolution. For the present devices, however, the sensing element is located on the waveguide endface, such as the endface of a fiber, thus permitting highly-accurate, small-proximity sensing. Furthermore, waveguide sensor arrays, such as optical fiber sensor arrays, may be readily implemented to simultaneously detect a wide variety of analytes, such as DNA sequences. A calibration fiber may be integrated in a bundle of the present devices to further increase accuracy for in vivo or remote measurement.</p>
    <p num="p-0068">Current fiber optic array sensors utilize fluorescence indicators and are less sensitive than the present devices. Additionally, since the deposition of dielectric thin films on optical fiber endfaces is well-known in the art, the present devices are suitable for mass production. Moreover, an array of the present devices may be fabricated simultaneously using standard thin film deposition methods well known in the art such as dipping, sputtering, spin coating, thermal evaporation, electron-beam evaporation, molecular beam epitaxy, metal-organic chemical vapor deposition, chemical vapor deposition, and liquid phase epitaxy, and submicron grating fabrication technology such as contact printing, and patterning techniques well known in the art such as holographic interferometry, photolithography, electron-beam lithography, and laser-beam lithography. Further still, other detection devices and techniques, such as SPR sensors or fluorescent detection, may be combined with the present devices, which utilize the GMR effect, to increase the flexibility of the present devices in a system for spectral filtering.</p>

    <p num="p-0070">The present devices (e.g., the fiber GMR sensors in Table 1) can be highly sensitive to the parameters of the waveguide gratings. Thus, the grating period, filling factor, number of layers, layer thicknesses, and refractive indices may be tailored for a specific waveguide grating device sensitivity and operational dynamic range. This flexibility allows the resonance wavelength, linewidth, and degree of sensitivity to be tailored for specific applications. By using a genetic algorithm program to design the present devices, specific design criteria such as sensing range or sensitivity may be realized. In general, the present waveguide grating devices have a much higher operational sensing range and greater sensor sensitivity than other fiber optic sensors. In addition, by utilizing biologically sensitive material, such as biopolymers to fabricate the waveguide grating, increased waveguide grating sensitivity may be achieved.</p>

    <p num="p-0072">Applications for the present devices and systems include use as fiber optic sensors for chemical/biochemical measurement in widespread applications that range from implantable devices used for continuous in vivo measurement to ex vivo analysis in a laboratory. Additionally, in fiber optic communications, the present device may be used to reject or transmit signals for multiplexing/demultiplexing of multiple wavelength channel systems. It is also to be understood that the present waveguide grating devices include multiple waveguides having ends with endfaces, on each of which waveguide gratings may be fabricated. Thus, the present devices may be used as sensors having multiple waveguides with waveguide gratings fabricated on the respective ends thereof. The present device also includes a waveguide, such as an optical fiber, having an end with an endface on which a waveguide grating is fabricated, which waveguide is adjacent to a second waveguide, such as an optical fiber, having an end with an endface onto which a waveguide grating may be fabricated. The waveguide gratings on the two waveguides may be oriented such that a signal propagated through the first waveguide may be reflected at least in part after contacting the first waveguide grating such that it then contacts the waveguide grating of the second waveguide and, thereafter, may be reflected by the second waveguide grating such that the signal is then transmitted through the second waveguide in a direction moving away from the second waveguide grating. In such an embodiment, the present device is a dual fiber sensor. Some applications include:</p>

    <p num="p-0081">As explained herein and in more detail in the Examples below (e.g., Example 3), the present devices are suitable candidates for use as spectroscopic sensing elements (i.e., filters) due at least in part to the narrow linewidths and high sensitivities of the guided-mode resonance peaks to variations in the physical parameters of the present devices (layer thicknesses, refractive indices, grating fill factor, and substrate and cover refractive indices). Thus, the present devices may be designed for a specific sensitivity, resolution, and operational dynamic range. This flexibility allows the resonance wavelength, linewidth, and degree of sensitivity to be tailored for specific applications. A sensor may be optimized to enhance sensitivity to specific parameters, such as refractive index and/or thickness. Since dielectric materials may be used in the fabrication of the present devices, many design configurations are available. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, one embodiment of a setup for use in monitoring the reflectance from one of the present devices is depicted.

    <p num="p-0083">The following examples are included to demonstrate specific embodiments of the invention. Example 1, however, does not include a description of an embodiment of the present devices. Instead, it includes a description of fabricating a diffractive grating (i.e., a grating layer) on a fiber endface. As the diffractive grating is not also a waveguide layer, it is not a waveguide grating. However, the description accompanying Example 1 may be useful in creating the present devices because the waveguide gratings of the present devices require a grating layer. Further, were the photoresist in Example 1 fabricated on a fiber having a slightly lower refracting index, the photoresist could have served as both a waveguide layer and a grating layer, thereby forming a waveguide grating. It should be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the techniques disclosed in the examples that follow represent techniques discovered by the inventors to function well in the practice of the invention, and thus can be considered to constitute exemplary modes for its practice. However, those of skill in the art should, in light of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific embodiments which are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. See also [Wawro, 1999] for information identical or similar to the following Examples.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE 1</heading> <p num="p-0084">Example 1 describes a procedure that was undertaken to optimize the manner of fabricating a diffractive grating, but not a waveguide grating, on the endface of a fiber. A high quality cleaving tool was used to obtain flat, optical quality endfaces on both single-mode and multimode fibers. After cleaving, the fibers were visually inspected with an optical microscope to determine endface quality. The fibers were cleaned by immersion in an ultrasonic bath of heated acetone for 30 minutes, briefly dipped in optical grade methanol, and dried with filtered nitrogen gas.</p>
    <p num="p-0085">The fabrication procedure was initially optimized by recording efficient submicron diffractive structures on the optical fiber endfaces. Thin films of UV-sensitive Shipley 1805 photoresist (PR) were deposited on the cleaved multimode and single-mode fiber endfaces by a dipping process. It was found that a dilution of 3 parts PR to 5 parts Shipley photoresist thinner yielded an approximate PR thickness of 300 nm. This thickness value was obtained from a test substrate that was dipped in the thinned solution, after which the thickness of the PR layer was measured via ellipsometery. The PR/thinner mixture was filtered before deposition with a glass fiber 0.2 μm particulate filter. No significant curvature of the PR layered on the fiber endfaces was observed in scanning electron microscope pictures for photoresist dilutions of greater than 1:1. After the dipping process, the fibers were soft baked in an oven at 90° C. for approximately 30 minutes. The soft bake improved PR adhesion and response linearity during exposure.</p>
    <p num="p-0086">Diffraction gratings with submicron periods were recorded in the PR layers using holographic interferometry with an UV Argon ion laser (λ=365 nm) as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. An exposure power of approximately 110 μW/cm<sup>2 </sup>for 22 seconds was required. The gratings were developed for approximately 20 seconds using Shipley MF-321 developer, resulting in a surface relief photoresist grating.</p>
    <p num="p-0087">The grating diffraction efficiency was tested by propagating laser light into the uncoated end of the fiber, and measuring the power output of the transmitted diffraction orders on the end with the diffraction grating. Light from each diffracted order was collimated with a lens and measured individually with an optical power detector head to obtain accurate intensity measurements. The intensity output of the transmitted diffracted orders was measured after coupling a white light source (halogen lamp) into an optical fiber with a 1.2 μm period photoresist grating recorded on its endface. An HeNe laser light (λ=633 nm) was also propagated into the optical fiber. A diffraction grating with 800 nm period on an optical fiber endface with a 100 μm core diameter was also evaluated, and is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. This device produced ±1 diffracted orders containing ˜50% of the total output power when tested with a HeNe laser (λ=633 nm). In addition, gratings with a period of 530 nm were recorded on optical fiber endfaces with 6.7 μm core diameters. The ±1 transmitted diffraction orders were measured to contain ˜10% of the total power coupled out of the fiber at a wavelength of 442 nm (HeCd laser).</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE 2</heading> <heading>Fabrication of Waveguide Gratings on Endfaces of Waveguides</heading> <p num="p-0088">In this example, waveguide gratings were fabricated on the endfaces of optical fibers. Once the ends of the fibers were cleaved to form endfaces and cleaned, deposition of dielectric thin-films was required to create a waveguide grating structure. In this example, thin films of Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>were deposited by sputtering on the clean, uncoated optical fiber endfaces. Silicon nitride is a hard, low loss dielectric material that has a relatively high refractive index (n=2.0). This commonly-used coating can also be patterned by etching in a reactive ion etching (RIE) chamber using standard fluorocarbon etchant gases, such as CF<sub>4 </sub>or CHF<sub>3</sub>. An RF-powered sputter machine that housed a single, three-inch Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>target was used to deposit the nitride films. Inert argon gas was used as the primary sputter gas, with a small amount (˜5%) of N<sub>2 </sub>included to prevent nitrogen depletion of the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>target. Nitrogen depletion results in an Si-rich film, which is typically quite lossy. The fibers were mounted in the chamber along with a test substrate made from fused silica to monitor the thickness of the deposited nitride films. The thickness, refractive index, absorption, index grading, and surface roughness of the deposited films were measured using a Woollam V-Vase spectroscopic ellipsometer.</p>
    <p num="p-0089">Next, the test substrate was spin coated with a 300 nm thick layer of PR and a 510 nm grating was recorded on its surface. Using the spectroscopic ellipsometer, the test waveguide grating structure was subjected to normal incidence transmission measurements, the results of which are indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The parameters of the test waveguide grating structure that led to the results depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are shown therein.

The calculations leading to the results depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> were performed with rigorous coupled-wave analysis, assuming plane waves at normal incidence on a structure with an infinite number of grating periods.</p>
    <p num="p-0091">Turning now to the details of this experiment, ˜200 nm layers of Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>were sputter deposited on multimode optical fiber endfaces with 100 μm core diameters. PR gratings with 510 nm periods were subsequently recorded to yield waveguide grating devices. The parameters of the devices are as follows: grating period, L, is 510 nm; PR thickness, d<sub>1</sub>, is 300 nm; Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>thickness, d<sub>2</sub>, is 200 nm; refractive index, n<sub>L</sub>, is 1.0; refractive index, n<sub>H</sub>, is 1.85; Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>refractive index, n<sub>2</sub>, is 1.85; fiber refractive index, n<sub>s</sub>, is 1.45.</p>
    <p num="p-0092">Testing was performed using the setup depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Spectral measurements made with tunable Ti:Sapphire laser (λ=730-900 nm) indicated GMR notches of ˜18% in the transmitted power, which was measured at the output of the optical fiber. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates the measured results without normalization. The low efficiency is partially attributed to the polarization sensitivity of the GMR effect, with TE and TM peaks occurring at different wavelengths and the polarization scrambling induced by propagation through the optical fiber. However, similar devices that are polarization independent may be achieved with two-dimensional gratings. Scattering due to imperfect fiber cleaves and rough silicon nitride films are also contributing factors to a decrease in GMR efficiency. Furthermore, it is assumed for modeling purposes that the wavefronts are essentially planar in nature due to the large core diameter. More accurate modeling may be required to account for the finite 2-D confinement of the incident beam, as well as the finite periodic structure on the fiber endface. It is contemplated that finite element or finite difference modeling would be well-suited for this purpose.</p>
    <p num="h-0015">Spectroscopic Sensor Designs</p>
    <p num="p-0093">The present waveguide grating devices are well-suited for use as spectroscopic filters due to the sensitivity of the devices to changes in parameters such as the thicknesses of the grating layer or layers and the waveguide layer or layers, the refractive indices of the same, the grating fill factor, and the substrate and cover refractive indices. Factors in addition to the parameters discussed above that may affect the configuration of a given waveguide grating device include the sources available for testing and the required sensor resolution. In general, waveguide gratings made of a single layer (i.e., waveguide gratings in which the at least one waveguide layer and the at least one grating layer are the same layer) are more sensitive to changes in the parameters discusses above than are waveguide gratings made of multiple layers, because the mode confinement of the single-layer waveguide grating is greater or heightened as compared to the mode confinement of multi-layer waveguide gratings.</p>
    <p num="p-0094"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-22</figref> illustrate examples of the present waveguide grating devices that may be used as filters/sensors for sensing changes in the parameters of the refractive index and the thickness of material that may contact the waveguide grating. The devices may be placed and utilized in fluid media including water and air.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE 4</heading> <heading>Sensor Placed in Aqueous Media and Used to Sense Changes in Thickness of Material Deposited on Waveguide Grating</heading> <p num="p-0095"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates certain parameters of both a sensor designed to detect changes in the thickness parameter of a material in an aqueous media, and a material contacted by the sensor. The waveguide grating is made of ZnSe and is fabricated on an endface of the waveguide, which, in this embodiment, is an optical fiber. Grating period, Λ, is 454 nm, thickness, d, of the waveguide grating is 371 nm, refractive index, n<sub>wg</sub>, of the waveguide grating is 2.55, and refractive index, n<sub>water</sub>, of water is 1.33. The refractive index of the material to be detected is 1.4. Material is a high index material can be deposited on waveguide grating by plasma etching. The above refractive index and thickness values were chosen to model typical bioselective agents, such as antigen/antibody attachments. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates the TE polarization spectral response of the waveguide grating device illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> to material and to changes in the thickness of material. As shown, a resonance shift of 1.9 nm was determined as 20 nm of material was added to the thickness of waveguide grating, and a 2.6 nm resonance shift was determined as a total of 40 nm of material was added to the thickness of waveguide grating as the peak wavelength shifted from 749.6 nm, to 751.5 nm, to 754.1 nm, respectively. In this case, the degree of resonant central wavelength shift is contributed to two parameter changes: the change in waveguide grating thickness that resulted from adding material to the waveguide grating, and a change in grating layer (which is also the waveguide grating) fill factor. The former parameter may contribute significantly to the resonance shift for fill factor values other than 0.5 [Tibuleac, 1996].</p>

    <p num="p-0101">All of the compositions and/or methods and/or apparatus disclosed and claimed herein may be made and executed without undue experimentation in light of the present disclosure. For example, techniques associated with preparing the endfaces of the present waveguides such as cleaving and polishing are known in the art. Techniques associated with fabricating, including dipping and spin coating, heating, and etching, and techniques associated with depositing, including sputtering, thermal evaporation, electron-beam evaporation, molecular beam epitaxy, metal-organic chemical vapor deposition, chemical vapor deposition and liquid phase epitaxy, are known in the art. Techniques associated with patterning, including holographic interferometry, photolithography, electron-beam lithography, laser-beam lithography, and contact printing, are known in the art.</p>
    <p num="p-0102">While the compositions and methods of this invention have been described in terms of specific embodiments, it will be apparent to those of skill in the art that variations may be applied to the compositions and/or methods and/or apparatus and in the steps or in the sequence of steps of the method described herein without departing from the concept, spirit and scope of the invention. For example, it is contemplated that waveguide gratings may be fabricated on graded index lenses. Additionally, the waveguide gratings of the present devices may be fabricated on the endfaces of the waveguides by directly recording the grating pattern into a dielectric material such as glass, for example. In such an embodiment, a photosensitive polymer for patterning or etching the grating pattern into the dielectric would not be used. Such fabrication may be realized through, for example, stresses that may be induced by illumination of the dielectric with a laser or an electron beam. For example, chalcogenide glass forms a surface relief grating if exposed to a laser interference pattern. Additionally, the present waveguide gratings may be fabricated on electro-optic waveguides. For example, an electro-optic fiber (such as one commercially available from Sentel Technologies) fabricated from a nonlinear dye-doped polymer having electrodes embedded around the fiber core may be prepared as described above to have an endface on which a waveguide grating may be fabricated. Since the refractive index of the core of such a fiber changes upon the application of a voltage, the resonance transmission or reflection peak may change depending on the refractive index of the core. In such an embodiment, the effect just described may be useful in calibrating the device or tuning it to a specific wavelength band (tunable filter). More specifically, it will be apparent that certain agents that are both chemically and physiologically related may be substituted for the agents described herein, while the same or similar results would be achieved. For example, dielectric materials from which the grating and waveguide layers of the present devices may be made include nonlinear dielectric materials. For example, polymers that incorporate nonlinear materials (for second order or third order nonlinear effects) or semiconductor materials having nonlinear materials therein may be utilized for the present layers. Consequently, present devices having waveguide gratings with such nonlinear materials may be used as wavelength converters (second harmonic generation). All such similar substitutes and modifications apparent to those skilled in the art are deemed to be within the spirit, scope and concept of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>

    <p num="p-0104">An important characteristic feature of genetic algorithms is that they operate on a coding (e.g., a binary coding) of the parameters rather than on the parameters themselves [77,104-108]. Thus, the first task of a genetic algorithm is to generate a set of random numbers in a particular encoding that corresponds to the variables of the problem. Each variable is called a “gene” or “allele” and represents a particular feature or character such as, for instance, the thickness or refractive index of a layer in a diffractive optics problem. By combining several genes one obtains a string called a “chromosome,” which represents a candidate solution. For example, in a homogeneous-layer thin-film optimization procedure a chromosome would be composed of the thicknesses and the refractive indices of all the layers in a structure. Many such candidate solutions are generated simultaneously by a genetic algorithm. Together they form a “population,” and successive populations generated by the genetic algorithm are referred to as “generations.”</p>
    <p num="p-0105">There are many implementations of genetic algorithms, but they all have in common the basic operators of selection, crossover, and mutation [77,104-108]. All these operators are applied on the population of a generation to create the next generation. A typical flow chart for a genetic algorithm optimization procedure is presented in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. An initial population is generated randomly with each gene spanning its allowed range of values. The domain can be discrete for some genes and continuous for others, the only restriction consisting in the locations of the genes in the chromosome, which must remain the same for all chromosomes. A merit (sometimes referred to as cost, fitness, or residual) function is calculated for each chromosome. This merit function is problem specific and the success of the optimization procedure depends largely on the choice of the merit function. The chromosomes are ranked in terms of their performance evaluated by the merit function. Successive generations are then created by retaining a part of the chromosomes from one generation to the next and by forming new chromosomes through recombination of the best chromosomes in the old population. The greater the fitness value of a chromosome, the more likely it is to participate in the recombination process. Some algorithms retain a fixed number of chromosomes [110] while others are more problem-specific and retain all chromosomes with fitness better than a user-defined value [111].</p>
    <p num="p-0106">The recombination process consists of applying either or both crossover and mutation operators. In the crossover operation, two chromosomes exchange portions of their encoded representation. The three types of crossover mechanisms encountered in genetic algorithms are illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> [112]. A single-point crossover is realized by choosing a point in the chromosome chains at random and exchanging the data to the right of this point between the parent chromosomes. In the two-point crossover the data between two randomly selected points is swapped while in the multiple-point crossover data is exchanged at random between the two parent chromosomes. Higher ranked strings will be more likely to participate in the crossover and thus form new chromosomes.</p>
    <p num="p-0107">The crossover operation is a random but structured information exchange between chromosomes and represents the essential tool in local searches, (i.e., in exploring points within the hyperplanes already represented in the population) [105]. However, crossover alone would produce convergence in local extrema and, to explore other points in space and avoid “premature convergence,” the mutation operator is introduced in the genetic algorithm.</p>
    <p num="p-0108">A mutation is the random change of a gene from one value to another. Mutation is carried out with a user-defined probability and according to the statistical rules implemented in the genetic algorithm program. Mutation has a very important role in the search process ensuring variability in the population and hence, avoiding the entrapment of the algorithm in local extrema of the merit function.</p>
    <p num="p-0109">The operators of selection, crossover and mutation are independent of the application, and only the merit function contains domain-specific knowledge. Another operator utilized in some genetic algorithms to diversify the search is the restarting operator. After a number of generations the best string is retained while all the others are discarded, and the whole population is reseeded as mutant variations of the best string. For the same purpose of avoiding premature convergence, other genetic operators introduce a random disturbance in every chromosome of a population after a number of generations or when all chromosomes have reached the same set of genes.</p>
    <p num="p-0110">The genetic algorithm ends after a user-determined fixed number of iterations, when the merit function has reached an extremum that is close enough to the desired value, or when all chromosomes in a population have merit functions within a small enough range.</p>
    <p num="h-0029">Genetic Algorithm Program for Midtilayer Waveguide Gratings</p>
    <p num="h-0030">Program Description</p>
    <p num="p-0111">A genetic algorithm program has been developed for optimization of diffractive optics structures with multiple homogeneous and grating layers and incident TE polarized plane waves [65,71,77]. The program employs rigorous coupled-wave analysis for calculation of the reflected and transmitted diffraction efficiencies [84-86] and, hence, for evaluation of the merit function for the generated structures. The software library PGAPack [110] performs specific genetic algorithm operations (chromosome generation, ranking, selection, crossover, mutation, etc.)</p>
    <p num="p-0112">The algorithm seeks to find the physical parameters of the diffractive structure that generates the spectral dependence of the zero-order reflected (or transmitted) diffraction efficiency provided by the user in a reference data file. Alternatively, the optimization can be performed for the angular dependence of the diffraction efficiency and at a fixed wavelength of the incident light. The physical parameters to be found in the optimization process are the grating period, the refractive indices, and the thicknesses of the layers, the fill factors, and relative spatial phase shifts of the gratings. The refractive indices of the cover and substrate, the angle of incidence (or the wavelength for angular dependence optimization), the maximum number of layers, and the minimum and maximum values for the thicknesses, fill factors, and grating period are required as input parameters to the program. The refractive indices of the candidate solutions are selected from a list of discrete values supplied by the user in a separate input file. All other physical parameters (grating period, fill factors, thicknesses) are allowed to vary continuously within the ranges established by the user. Therefore, the program seeks the minimum of the merit function in a mixed discrete and continuous parameter space. This is a practical approach since in fabrication of diffractive optical structures only a limited number of materials can be used in a given spectral range while the thicknesses, fill factors, and the grating period can be varied continuously within a range, and within the accuracy limitations of the equipment. In some applications one or more of the physical parameters may be fixed due to either fabrication constraints (e.g., fill factor of the grating equal to 0.5) or user knowledge about the physics of the problem (e.g., known grating period for center wavelength of resonance filters). This feature is included in the program and will expedite the search procedure by reducing the dimension of the parameter space. A priori information can also simplify the search procedure by reducing the range over which a parameter can vary during optimization, thereby reducing the total number of points in the parameter space.</p>
    <p num="p-0113">The physical parameters of the diffractive structure can be encoded as binary, binary Gray, or real numbers [110]. For binary and binary Gray representations of real and integer numbers, the user must specify the number of bits for encoding the thicknesses, the grating period, the fill factors, and the refractive indices. The number of bits allocated for each variable determines the accuracy of the representation of real numbers. Increasing the accuracy allows a better solution to be found but at the same time increases the total number of points in the parameter space decreasing the convergence. The binary and the binary Gray encodings allow the genetic algorithm to access and operate on individual bits of a gene, instead of the gene as a whole as in the real encoding [110]. For instance, a single-point crossover operation may take place with the crossover point in the middle of a gene in the binary encodings but only between genes in the real encoding. The Gray binary encoding differs from the binary encoding in that consecutive integer numbers differ by only one bit. This difference induces different paths in the genetic algorithm optimization procedure. For instance, mutation of one bit in a gene produces an incremental change in the value of the corresponding physical parameter if it is represented in Gray code, but may lead to a large variation in the case of binary encoding.</p>
    <p num="p-0114">The program starts by randomly generating a population of chromosomes in the specified encoding and range of values for each variable. As an example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26B</figref> shows the chromosome of a double-layer grating with its genes corresponding to the physical parameters of the structure illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</figref> [65,7 1]. The chromosome has (5N<sub>L</sub>+1) genes where N<sub>L </sub>is the number of layers of the diffractive structure. Each layer is assumed to be a grating with the same period Λ, but with different refractive indices n<sub>H </sub>and n<sub>L</sub>, thicknesses d, and coordinates (relative to the grating period) of the high-refractive index region of each grating X<sub>L </sub>and X<sub>H</sub>. To select the refractive indices in each layer, the algorithm generates integer random numbers, which represent pointers to refractive index values in the corresponding input file. Homogeneous layers are generated either when the same refractive index is selected for both regions of the binary grating, or when the fill factor defined as (X<sub>H</sub>−X<sub>L</sub>) is smaller or greater than the values specified by the user in the input file f<sub>min </sub>and f<sub>max</sub>. For (X<sub>H</sub>−X<sub>L</sub>) &lt;f<sub>min </sub>the layer is considered as homogeneous with the refractive index n<sub>L</sub>, while for (X<sub>H</sub>−X<sub>L</sub>)&gt;f<sub>max </sub>the layer is homogeneous with refractive index n<sub>H</sub>. Different values of X<sub>L </sub>in different layers generate phase-shifted layers. The number of layers N<sub>L </sub>is fixed and provided by the user. However the program can analyze structures with fewer layers whenever it selects a layer thickness that is smaller than the minimum layer thickness (from the input file). In this case, the thickness is set to zero and the number of layers decreases by one.</p>
    <p num="p-0115">The number sequence forming a population of strings is unique for each run of the program. A feature is included that allows the same number sequence to be generated each time for debugging or reproducibility purposes [110]. In binary representation, each bit of a string has equal probabilities of being set to 0 or 1. In the real encoding the genes are set to a value selected uniformly within the user-specified range.</p>
    <p num="p-0116">The population (i.e., the total number of chromosomes generated in the beginning, which is to remain constant after each iteration) is established by the user depending on the dimension of the search space and the length of the chromosome. An increased number of genes and/or a large range of variation for the genes may require a large population for effective optimization. Operating with larger populations, the genetic algorithm is more likely to find the global minimum of the merit function since it searches more regions of the space simultaneously. However, this is achieved at the expense of an increase in computational time, which imposes a practical limitation on the population size.</p>
    <p num="p-0117">The initially generated population is evaluated by calculating a merit function for each chromosome as the deviation between the synthesized value of reflected (or transmitted) zero-order diffraction efficiency and the desired one. The genetic algorithm searches for the global minimum of the following merit function</p>

where DE<sub>GA,i </sub>are zero order reflected (or transmitted) diffraction efficiency values calculated with rigorous-coupled wave analysis for the structure generated by the genetic algorithm, DE<sub>ref,i </sub>are the reference data points, M is the total number of target values, w<sub>i </sub>are the weight factors, and n is the power index of the merit function. The target points represent either a wavelength or an angular dependence of a diffraction order efficiency. Any diffraction order may be selected for optimization, but for the applications of interest to this work concerning only zero-order gratings, the zero-order efficiencies are utilized. The power index of the merit function can take any integer values but in thin-film optics optimization routines the most common value is n=2. Different values of n, can affect the optimization results due to changes induced in the relative contributions of individual target deviation points |DE<sub>GA,i</sub>−DE<sub>ref,j</sub>| to the merit function. For larger values of n higher deviations, will be emphasized and the merit function becomes more sensitive to nonequal deviations forcing the genetic algorithm to find a more uniform approximation to the reference data [96].
</p>
    <p num="p-0119">Once the merit function has been calculated, the chromosomes are ranked from the best-fit to the least-fit, with the best-fit possessing the lowest merit function. A number of chromosomes are retained while others are replaced by newly generated chromosomes. The selection mechanism typically used is the tournament selection consisting in retaining the best chromosomes of a population. Other selection mechanisms such as probabilistic tournament (with an associated probability of selecting a chromosome), proportional and stochastic universal selection can also be chosen for use in the optimization procedure [110]. The number of chromosomes replaced is an input parameter to the program and has an important influence on the optimization progress. A high percentage of chromosomes replaced provides more new points for fitness testing which is beneficial in the search procedure, but it will also increase the computation time. It is also possible that a large replacement will cause the elimination of certain chromosomes that, after subsequent crossover and mutation, would have generated the optimum solution. Therefore, several convergence tests need to be performed to establish the optimum population replacement for a specific problem [77].</p>
    <p num="p-0120">The new population that replaces the discarded chromosomes is formed by crossover and mutation of the chromosomes that are retained from the old generation [110]. The chromosomes that survive become parents and generate enough chromosomes to maintain the total population constant from one generation to another. The algorithm allows the user to decide whether a string can undergo both crossover and mutation or just one of the two operations.</p>
    <p num="p-0121">In the case where either crossover or mutation is carried out, the probability of going towards one or the other operation is decided by a random logical variable that has an associated flip probability (provided in the input file) of returning a logical value “true.” A probability of 0.5 corresponds to flipping an unbiased coin. In the case when both mutation and crossover are performed, the random logical value of the flip probability determines whether crossover is executed first followed by a mutation operation or vice versa [110].</p>
    <p num="p-0122">Crossover takes place by pairing the chromosomes selected to survive from the old generation into the new one from top to bottom of the list (with best-ranked strings at the top). The crossover operation is performed with a probability defined by the user in the input file. The algorithm has the options of single-point, two-point or uniform crossover (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>). For the latter type of crossover, the probability of swapping two parent bits (or genes in case of real encoding) called uniform crossover probability, must be specified in the input file.</p>
    <p num="p-0123">Mutation takes place with a probability defined by the user in the input file. For binary encoding, mutation is performed by replacing one or more of the bits of a chromosome with its complement. For real encoding, the mutation occurs for one or more genes of a chromosome and can be one of several types: “range,” “constant,” “uniform,” or “Gaussian” [110]. If the mutation is of the “range” type, the gene will be replaced with a number selected with equal probability from the allowed range of variation for the gene. In the other three mutation types the gene g is replaced by g±p×g where the value of p is determined differently for each mutation operator. For constant mutation, p is a constant provided by the user. Uniform mutation occurs when p is selected uniformly from an interval [0−M<sub>u</sub>] where M<sub>u </sub>is an input parameter. In the Gaussian type of mutation p is generated by a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation σ given in the input file.</p>
    <p num="p-0124">After generating a new pair of chromosomes through crossover and/or mutation, the algorithm performs a verification to determine whether they are different from their parent chromosomes. If the new chromosome is identical to the parent chromosome, the mutation operator is applied to the new chromosome until at least one mutation has occurred.</p>
    <p num="p-0125">After evaluation of the newly generated chromosomes and ranking the new generation, the process of selection, crossover, and mutation is repeated until the stopping criteria is met. This can be determined by a fixed number of iterations, no change in the best string after a number of iterations, or when certain fraction of the population has the same merit function [110]. The genetic algorithm also has the restarting option by which the best string is kept and all others are generated as mutants of the best string. The number of iterations between restarting operations is defined by the user.</p>
    <p num="p-0126">The program prints the best N<sub>out </sub>chromosomes and their corresponding merit functions in the output file, where N<sub>out </sub>is an input parameter. By printing a number of the top chromosomes, the user can asses the distribution of solutions and hence the degree of convergence of the algorithm. A large dispersion in the gene values of the final chromosomes indicates that the algorithm has not yet converged and changes need to be made in the input parameters of a future run. Typical changes would be to try more iterations, larger populations, or impose more constraints according to a priori knowledge about the physics of the problem [111]. However changes in other genetic algorithm input parameters can also improve the convergence and the effectiveness of the optimization.</p>
    <p num="h-0031">Convergence Tests</p>
    <p num="p-0127">The genetic algorithm developed in this work has a general applicability. The genetic operators and optimization procedure can be utilized in any optimization task involving multilayer structures containing gratings and homogeneous layers, with minor modifications pertaining to the encoding and decoding of the chromosomes. The merit function evaluation subroutines can be applied to optimization of any structure that can be modeled with the rigorous coupled-wave analysis.</p>
    <p num="p-0128">However, the optimum set of the program-input parameters may be problem specific due to the dimension of the solution space and the particular variation of the merit function in the parameter space. To determine the influence of the input parameters on the optimization procedure and final result, and to find some guidelines for selecting the appropriate set of input parameters for a specific application, it is important to study the evolution of the optimization process (i.e., the convergence) for various starting conditions [65,77].</p>
    <p num="p-0129">In this section, the convergence of the merit function is studied as a function of key genetic-algorithm parameters such as the population replaced at each iteration, mutation probability, type of encoding, number of generations, population size, for the same problem. In all tests discussed here, the program is required to design a single-layer guided-mode resonance reflection filter with the response specified in the input file by the spectral dependence of the zero-order reflection diffraction efficiency. This reference data is generated with the rigorous coupled-wave theory for a single-layer grating with the following physical parameters: grating period Λ=314 nm, thickness d=134 nm, fill factor f=0.5, refractive indices of the grating: n<sub>H</sub>=2.1 and n<sub>L</sub>=2.0, refractive indices of the cover and substrate: n<sub>C</sub>=1.0 and n<sub>S</sub>=1.52, and normally incident, TE polarized plane wave. The optimization is performed in terms of the layer thickness, fill factor and refractive indices of the grating over a wavelength range 0.546-0.554 μm. The grating period is fixed at the value Λ=314 nm, the cover and substrate refractive indices have constant values of n<sub>C</sub>=1.0 and n<sub>S</sub>=1.52, respectively, and the incident angle is set at θ=0°. The allowed range for fill factor optimization is between 0.1-0.9 and the thickness range is 50-350 nm. Throughout the tests the algorithm uses the same set of 13 refractive indices with values from 1.3-2.5 in increments of 0.1. The materials are assumed to be lossless although the program can handle lossy grating structures as well.</p>
    <p num="p-0130">Comparing the merit function values for tests with the three different types of crossover, it was found that multiple crossover yields the best results in comparison with the single-point and two-point crossover operators. The crossover probability was maintained at 0.8 and the uniform crossover probability was 0.5 for all tests performed. Other genetic algorithm parameters kept constant for all tests were the flip probability equal to 0.5, the tournament selection type, and maximum iteration as the stopping criterion.</p>
    <p num="p-0131">The tests performed with populations of 500 and 1000 chromosomes indicate that although fast convergence and low merit function values are also possible with a smaller number of chromosomes, for certain values of the genetic algorithm parameters, the larger population is generally expected to yield lower merit functions, for all other parameters being constant. However, in some cases the increased computation time for larger populations may not be rewarded by a substantial decrease in merit function and an optimum population has to be determined for a typical chromosome length and search space. It has been observed that larger populations also provide the algorithm with less sensitivity to the other input parameters, and therefore fewer trials are required to determine the optimum set of genetic algorithm parameters.</p>
    <p num="p-0132">A more detailed investigation of the convergence sensitivity to genetic algorithm parameters was performed for the population replacement and the mutation probability, contrasting real versus binary and Gray encoding performance [77]. Hence, the population size was fixed at 500, the crossover type was uniform with probability fixed at 0.8, and the number of generations and mutation probability were varied. For the real encoding the mutation type was chosen to be Gaussian with standard deviation σ=0.1. In all cases the newly created strings were specified to undergo both crossover and mutation. When using binary or Gray encoding, 10 bits were chosen to represent the thickness, 10 bits to represent the fill factor, and 4 bits to represent the pointer to the set of materials. In this case uniform crossover with probability 0.8 was chosen. The number of generations was taken to be 400, to ensure that convergence had been reached.</p>
    <p num="p-0133">After performing at least four runs for the same set-up, with different random number sequences in the genetic algorithm functions to seed the population, in order to construct a statistically significant sample of the outcomesit was noted that the real encoding produced smaller merit functions, therefore indicating that for this problem it is better suited than the others. Overall, the sensitivity to replacement values over the range 50-250 chromosomes was not very strong considering the total distribution of results. In the case of real encoding, on average, the lowest merit function was obtained for a replacement value of 150. In the case of binary and Gray encodings, slightly smaller merit functions were achieved for the replacement value of 250. However, this replacement also produced a large spread of the residuals indicating that a poor solution can obtained as well as a good one.</p>
    <p num="p-0134">Turning to the behavior of the residual as a function of increasing values of mutation probability, for the binary and Gray encoding, a replacement value of 50 was used, whereas for the real encoding the value was 200. Otherwise, the same genetic algorithm parameters as discussed above were retained. The binary and Gray encoding results were not very sensitive to the value of mutation probability. However, on average, the binary encoding favored lower mutation probabilities than the real encoding, which benefits from an increase in the value of this parameter to 1. In the real encoding, the mutation operator was applied to the gene as a whole, which, for the structures studied here, are represented by 4 numbers. In the binary encoding, mutation took place at the level of individual bits (e.g., for a representation of the filter parameters (d, f, n<sub>H</sub>, n<sub>L</sub>) with (10, 10, 4, 4) bits, the mutation is applied individually to all of the 28 bits of the chromosome with the specified mutation probability).</p>
    <p num="p-0135">Therefore, for the mutation to be active in the search procedure with the real encoding, the mutation probability must be higher than in the binary case where a low probability is compensated by the larger number of elements (bits) to which it is applied. The differences observed between the binary and the real encodings were also due to the different manner in which mutation was carried out. In the real encoding, the Gaussian mutation did not change the gene value by an arbitrarily large amount as in the binary case, but applied a random change in a limited range (determined by σ) around the value of the gene.</p>
    <p num="p-0136">Thus, in the real encoding, mutation performed a more localized search alongside the crossover operator before shifting to a different region of space and was able to find a global minimum with greater accuracy. It was found that mutation probabilities of 1 were detrimental in the binary encoding due to the rapid changes occurring in the best chromosomes, which prevented the fine tuning performed by crossover. On average, very low mutation probabilities (0.001) produced equally poor results by precluding the algorithm from exploring new regions in the parameter space.</p>
    <p num="p-0137">Turning to the convergence history for three different values of number of chromosomes replaced at each generation (i.e., 50, 150 and 250), when increasing this number, note that the value of the merit function at convergence was reached after a decreasing number of generations. While the computational burden increased with the increase of the chromosomes replaced per generation, this was offset by the ability to reach convergence in fewer generations.</p>
    <p num="p-0138">Therefore, the total amount of calculations necessary to reach convergence was similar in all cases. Note that the real encoding generally provided lower merit functions than the binary and Gray encodings. The high sensitivity of the guided-mode resonances to structural parameters was equivalent to a rugged search space for the genetic algorithm with multiple and narrow local extrema. Therefore, the improved fine-tuning performed by the mutation operator in the real encoding lead to superior convergence results.</p>
    <p num="p-0139">The number of reference reflectance vs. wavelength points has been found to significantly influence the final result of the optimization process. It is well known from homogeneous thin-film optimization techniques that more “targets” typically lead to improved results due to the additional information supplied by the user [94].</p>
    <p num="p-0140">The number of data points was an even more critical parameter in the design of grating devices that exhibit sharp variations in the reflectance and transmittance spectral dependence. In this case, the global minima of the merit function can not be reached if insufficient target data is provided. In reference 112, for instance, the micro-genetic algorithm uses only one reference point with zero-order reflectance equal to 1 at the wavelength [ =1.0]. The resulting structure exhibits an almost 100% peak at λ=1.0 but other high-efficiency peaks are also present in the proximity of the desired peak thus limiting the filter range. The side peaks can be eliminated in the optimization process by providing the merit function with more reference reflectance points. In the present work, between 40-80 reference data points were used. The major drawback of the increased number of target data was the increased computation time.</p>
    <p num="p-0141">The distribution of reference reflectance points in the spectral range of interest was also important in the search for an optimum design. In the case of the rapidly varying reflectance characteristics studied here, it was advantageous to use unequally spaced data points with more reflectance values in the resonance spectral region and less in the sidebands. Utilizing this type of distribution, the algorithm was able in all tests to find a resonance and typically within ±0.1 nm of the reference reflectance peak.</p>
    <p num="p-0142">A different method to emphasize some reference points over others is to introduce different weight factors. Increased values of the weight factors in some reference points will raise the accuracy in these spectral regions at the expense of a larger target deviation in wavelength regions considered of lesser importance.</p>
