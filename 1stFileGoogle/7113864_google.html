A database stores records each documenting needed transportation services. Processing circuitry (which may be one or several networked computers) reviews these records, locates records indicating a need for immediate transportation service, and instructs vehicles to provide the service. The processing circuitry also monitors vehicle activities by reviewing the records, and automatically obtained vehicle activity information, to identify transportation services which are not being adequately provided, and refer these to human dispatchers for special attention. A variety of methods for obtaining and updating vehicle activity information are disclosed, as are various applications for the system.</div>

<heading>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading> <p num="p-0002">This application is a divisional of prior application Ser. No. 10/195,042, filed Jul. 15, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,694,248 which is a divisional of prior application Ser. No. 08/980,645, filed on Dec. 1, 1997, issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,430,496, on Aug. 6, 2002, which is a divisional of prior application Ser. No. 08/549,380, filed on Oct. 27, 1995, issued as U.S. Pat. No. 5,835,376 on Nov. 10, 1998. These prior applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">The present invention relates to dispatching or controlling of taxis, ambulances, or other vehicles.</p>
  <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0004">A number of systems have been devised for dispatching of vehicles or other services upon demand. The complexity of dispatching systems ranges from fully manual systems to systems employing elaborate computer databases and tracking systems.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">To dispatch vehicles accurately and in a timely fashion, several things must be done concurrently. Vehicles must be tracked so that their location is known so that they may be efficiently selected for future jobs. The position and status of dispatched vehicles must be monitored to determine if they are on time or delayed. Customer requests must be received and posted for dispatching, and then dispatched. Delayed arrivals should be identified and reported to the customer as soon as possible.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">A fully manual dispatching system (such as is employed by smaller taxi companies), requires a single human being to perform all of the tasks identified above. More modern dispatching systems provide automation of some of the described tasks.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">For example, various systems have been established to manage the reception and posting of customer requests. For example, the “Life-TRAK” is system, available from the assignee of the present application, provides a database server storing a database of customer request records. New records are generated by call takers who receive incoming telephone calls from customers. Also, records may be generated at remote sites, for example by contract customers, and transmitted into the central database by telephone connections. The customer requests are then reported to dispatchers who determine when the requests are in need of service, and dispatch a vehicle as needed.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">There are also commercially available systems for assisting the dispatching tasks described above. For example, there are commercially available Automatic Vehicle Locator (AVL) systems which automatically track (typically via satellite navigation) the locations of managed vehicles, so that this information can be reported to a dispatcher in textual or graphic form to assist the dispatcher determining the locations of vehicles. Typically, the dispatcher uses this information to select a vehicle for a particular job, and then forwards instructions to the driver to assign them the job. Often, the AVL includes data fields where the dispatcher may store an indication of the status of a vehicle (e.g., dispatched or available) and the vehicle's capabilities (e.g., wheelchair-compatible, etc.) so that this information can be used by the dispatcher in selecting a vehicle for a job and monitoring activity of the vehicles.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">Advanced AVL systems further facilitate dispatching, by automatically identifying, upon request, the nearest vehicles to a given address or latitude/longitude position, to assist the dispatcher in selecting a vehicle for dispatch. Furthermore, AVL systems may also include a street map database and search algorithm through which the AVL can identify a street route from one address to another upon request from the dispatcher.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">In some cases, the dispatcher communicates with the vehicles via radio communication or cellular telephone connections. In other cases, the AVL system itself includes support for textual communication between dispatchers and the vehicles through mobile data terminals (MDT's) mounted in the vehicle, which typically make use of underlying cellular communication networks.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0011">Despite the high degree of automation that has been applied to vehicle dispatching, as described above, one common thread between fully manual dispatching and the most automated dispatching systems is their central reliance on human beings to make dispatching decisions and perform monitoring of vehicles once dispatched. Unfortunately, it has been found that a primary source of errors, in even the most automated dispatching systems, is human error. For example, a dispatcher may misread customer job request and fail to dispatch it on time. Or the dispatcher may forward a dispatch to a vehicle through a MDT but fail to follow up and ensure that the MDT message has been acknowledged by the vehicle driver and that the vehicle is en route, causing the vehicle to arrive late, or not at all. Or, in the case of taxi or ambulance/ambulette dispatching, the dispatcher may through inadvertence assign a taxi which is not wheelchair-equipped to a job which requires a wheelchair-equipped vehicle, or assign an ambulette (wheelchair ambulance) to a job which requires a stretcher ambulance, resulting in wasted time and/or delay for the customer. Or special instructions relating to the customer, route, or other items may fail to be forwarded to the vehicle.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">It is the object of the present invention to overcome these shortcomings in known vehicle dispatching systems by providing a fully automated dispatching system which, at least under normal operating conditions, eliminates the human dispatcher from dispatching operations. The elimination of human errors of the kind described in the previous paragraph greatly improves the consistency of service provided to customers and improves the likelihood of repeat requests.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">In one specific aspect, the invention features a system for controlling vehicles to provide transportation services without need for human intervention, including a database of records each documenting needed transportation services. This database is reviewed by processing circuitry to, locate records indicating a need for immediate transportation service, and then instruct vehicles to provide the vehicle service. In addition, the processing circuitry monitors the records after dispatching, along with vehicle activity information, to identify transportation services which are not being adequately provided. The processing circuitry is in continuous automatic communication with the vehicles, forwarding instructions to vehicles and obtaining vehicle activity information relating to each vehicle.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">The processing circuitry may be a microcomputer running a multitasking operating system, a network of computers, or any other arrangement of computing hardware, including an arrangement of computers spread geographically in a wide-area network. There may be multiple processes to dispatch and monitor vehicles, running simultaneously on networked computers or in a multitasking operating system.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">The vehicle communications may use ground-based radio communication, satellite-based radio communication, or both. In particular, satellite-based vehicle tracking circuitry may be used to track the locations of the vehicles, and the vehicle locations forwarded via satellite or radio to the processing circuitry for using in vehicle monitoring.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">The vehicle monitoring may evaluate the vehicle's movements and position to determine if it has arrived at or is en route to an appointed location. Alternatively, or in addition, the vehicle operator may manually communicate the arrival of the vehicle at the appointed location.</p>
  <p num="p-0017">Requests for vehicle service may be entered by call takers at the location of the database server, or may be entered remotely via telephone, either at a data terminal at a customer site or via touch-tone telephone or at an ATM-like facility using a customer identification card.</p>
  <p num="p-0018">When the automated dispatching and controlling system finds a task which is not being adequately serviced, and cannot rectify the situation, the system creates an exception records to refer this situation to a human dispatcher who then may take extraordinary action with respect to the situation.</p>
  <p num="p-0019">The automated dispatching and controlling system not only collects vehicle appointment and activity information, but also collects billing information associated with requested transportation services, for example, in an ambulance environment, the patient name, diagnosis, reason for transit, insurance information, etc. When a task is completed, this information is used to automatically, and without further human involvement, generate paper or electronic invoicing for the services rendered.</p>
  <p num="p-0020">The system may also be used to monitor use of the vehicles, e.g., whether the vehicle is moving, the velocity of the vehicle, whether the vehicle is braking, fuel usage of the vehicle, whether emergency signals of the vehicle are operating, and whether the engine is idling. This information can be used to determine, in a more detailed manner, the status of the vehicle, e.g., whether it is stalled in traffic, or whether the vehicle is being used inappropriately. In either case, an exception record can be generated to refer the situation to a human dispatcher.</p>
  <p num="p-0021">The collection of information on current vehicle status and future appointments can be combined to provide continual, automated system status management, to determine and predict future needs for transportation services and compare the future needs to expected availability of transportation services. If this process identifies future times at which available transportation services will not meet predicted needs, this situation can be referred to a human dispatcher ahead of time so that corrective action can be taken. Alternatively, or in addition, the system may automatically instruct a vehicle to pre-position to a location where the vehicle will be better able to meet predicted future needs for transportation services, to minimize future delays.</p>
  <p num="p-0022">An important feature of the automated dispatching system is that a dispatching process instruction to a vehicle identifies a route to be followed by the vehicle. This feature will be increasingly important in the future when governmental or insurance entities may begin to demand particular routing, or at least identify maximum mileages that will be reimbursed. By ensuring vehicles follow pre-defined routing, these requirements can be more easily met.</p>
  <p num="p-0023">Indeed, it is expected that the ability to automatically generate routes, and to automatically provide them to vehicles, in accordance with the present invention, will heighten awareness of mileage charges and result in a demand for systems to review mileage charges (no matter how generated) and compare the mileage charges to the mileage for an optimal routing. Such a system might be used by an insurance or governmental agency to locate excessive mileage charges, or used by a transit company to pre-screen invoices before they are rejected by an insurance or governmental agency. Accordingly, the present invention encompasses systems which make use of existing AVL technology to compute routing and mileage based on invoiced pickup and destination sites, and then compare the mileage of the computed route to the mileage charged in the invoice.</p>

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p num="p-0033">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a fully automated vehicle dispatching, monitoring and billing system in accordance with the principles of the present invention, includes several elements for automated dispatching and monitoring which have been discussed above in the background of this application. Specifically, the system includes a database server <b>10</b> for storing records indicating requested vehicle services and associated information. This database is created initially at one of two data entry sites <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. Call takers <b>12</b> located at the dispatching facility (multiple call takers being illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) receive telephone requests from customers such as customer <b>13</b> and, in response, generate request records in the database in several tests. Contract customers <b>14</b> may also possess remote data entry terminals at which the customers may enter data into database server <b>10</b> over a telephone connection <b>15</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0034">Incoming requests may also be accepted by various other methods; for example, remote facilities may enter information over a radio, or satellite, or Internet, or other communications links rather than telephones. Furthermore, requests may be entered through touch tone dialing at a touch tone telephone in a manner analogous to that current used for telephone banking. Another alternative is that requests may be entered at remote kiosks similar to automated teller machines, using health insurance or identification cards issued to customers.</p>
  <p num="p-0035">The dispatching facility also includes a number of human dispatchers <b>16</b> who interact with data in the database <b>10</b> to dispatch vehicles. Dispatchers <b>16</b> may interact with the database and server <b>10</b> and an AVL system <b>16</b> to perform dispatching of vehicles <b>20</b> in the same manner as is performed in known dispatching systems as discussed above. Particularly, dispatchers <b>16</b> may review request records in database server <b>10</b>, and in response to these records interact with AVL system <b>18</b> to request vehicle location information and routing information and to relay dispatching commands and request status updates from vehicles over wireless communication links <b>22</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0036">In known dispatching systems described in the background of this application, this kind of interaction between database server <b>10</b> and AVL system <b>18</b>, using human dispatchers <b>16</b>, is the primary and only mode of operation. However, in accordance with the principles of the present invention, this human-based mode of dispatching is used only in extraordinary circumstances. Under normal circumstances, the interactions with database server <b>10</b> and AVL system <b>18</b> are fully automated and are performed by communications processes <b>24</b>, dispatching processes <b>26</b> and vehicle monitoring processes <b>28</b>, which automatically dispatch and monitor vehicles in response to orders reflected in records and database <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0037">In accordance with this new and unique model for dispatching of vehicles, dispatchers <b>16</b> do not constantly interact with database server <b>10</b>, AVL system <b>18</b>, and the vehicle drivers, but rather only interact with the drivers and other systems when extraordinary circumstances require human intervention into the automatic dispatching provided by processes <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. This infrequent interaction with the AVL system <b>18</b> and server <b>10</b> is represented by dotted lines <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> between dispatchers <b>16</b>, AVL system <b>18</b> and database server</p>
  <p num="p-0038">Under normal circumstances, as will be explored more fully below, dispatchers <b>16</b> have an only supervisory and monitoring role. Dispatchers may, for example, monitor vehicle activities and dispatching to ensure the system is operating properly and perhaps to override automatic dispatching decisions which are obviously erroneous or should be handled differently for policy reasons. Furthermore, dispatchers might update vehicle status information based using intelligence gained from outside the automated dispatch system. However, although dispatchers <b>16</b> they may perform various monitoring of this kind and may occasionally override automated dispatching, dispatchers <b>16</b> will typically only become actively involved in a given dispatching transaction when the automated dispatching processes <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> identify an exception requiring human intervention and a corresponding exception record is placed into database server <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0039">Exception records are immediately reviewed by dispatchers <b>16</b>, who may then interact with the AVL system <b>18</b> to determine the location of the vehicle, and/or may communicate with the driver through the AVL system (in the manner described below) or through a radio, cellular phone, pager, or satellite communications to determine the cause of the exception and resolve the exception.</p>
  <p num="p-0040">The following figures and description provide a detailed elaboration of the specific operations of the communications processes <b>24</b>, dispatching processes <b>26</b> and vehicle monitoring processes <b>28</b> to automate the previously manual, human-based operations of the dispatchers <b>16</b> to permit the dispatchers to focus on exceptional situations.</p>
  <p num="p-0041">As an initial matter, it will be understood that the software for performing the remaining tasks illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, such as the local and remote call taking and data entry, dispatcher record monitoring, automated vehicle location and vehicle communication, can be one of a number of commercially available software packages for vehicle dispatching, including, for example, the above-noted “Life-TRAK” software which is particularly suited for dispatching of ambulances. The file formats and software flowcharts described in detail below are particularly suited for incorporation into the existing commercially-available “Life-TRAK” system which is available from the assignee of this patent application.</p>
  <p num="p-0042">The software used in “Life-TRAK”, and the additional software components described below, are preferably written in a source code language providing easy transport between computing platforms. One particularly suitable source code language is BBx Business Basic, sold by Basis International of Albuquerque, N. Mex. This language provides portability of source code between any one of (a) a PC/DOS/Windows/Windows95 standalone or Novell Netware server environment using BBx for DOS/Novell; (b) a Unix network using serial terminals using BBx for Unix (SCO/AIX/Etc.); (c) a Windows for Workgroups environment with or without a Windows NT server using BBx for Windows for Workgroups. Furthermore, using the BBx TCP Data Server software, any or all of the above can be connected in a wide-area or Internet network.</p>
  <p num="p-0043">Suitable Automatic Vehicle Locator systems can be purchased from various vendors including DCS, Inc., Teletrak, American TriTech, and EAI; these AVL systems either include low-level communications protocols of the kind illustrated below in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3K-1</figref> to <b>3</b>R-<b>2</b> or will revise their AVL systems to support such communications.</p>
  <p num="p-0044">It should be noted that a system other than the AVL may be used to support the communications between the dispatching systems and the AVL; for example, there are presently being introduced satellite paging-response systems which permit two way communications between mobile pagers and a central office via direct satellite communications. These systems could be used to transmit and receive the information discussed below in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3K-1</figref> to <b>3</b>R-<b>2</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0045">It is contemplated that a given automated dispatching system may include multiple communications processes <b>24</b>, dispatching processes <b>26</b> and vehicle monitoring processes <b>28</b>, running independently in networked computing systems. Thus, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a multiplicity of each process active in the automated dispatching system. The source language used for programming this system must include facilities for locking individual database records for a multiprocessing environment—such record locking is provided by the BBX Business Basic language described above. In the following discussion, the flow charts and operations of each of the communications, dispatching and vehicle monitoring processes will be elaborated with an understanding that multiple processes may be in simultaneous operation at any given time and processing dispatching records in server <b>10</b> simultaneously. It will also be understood that human dispatchers <b>16</b>, because they are freed from most dispatching tasks, will monitor the overall operation of the automated dispatching system and determine whether a “bottleneck” has occurred at any of the communications, dispatching or vehicle monitoring phases of operations, and if so may initiate additional ones of processes <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> or <b>28</b>, respectively, to provide added computing time to the task which is experiencing a bottleneck.</p>
  <p num="p-0046">It is further contemplated that various aspects of the automated dispatching system may be separated physically from one another; so, for example, database server <b>10</b> may be at a geographically central location whereas AVL systems and computing systems running processes <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> may be remotely located and communicating with database server <b>10</b> over a wide-area or Internet network through the above-described communications facilities. Other possible combinations of physical locations of the various components illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are contemplated and within the scope of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0047">It will be further appreciated that manual dispatching (such as that which is facilitated by the above-noted “Life-TRAK” system) may be performed in one area using server <b>10</b> while automated dispatching is performed in another area. Or, manual and automated dispatching may be performed simultaneously at the same-area, or finally automated dispatching may be halted and all dispatching performed manually by dispatchers <b>16</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0048">Now turning to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the various data files used by automated dispatch processes <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> to perform automated dispatching of vehicles <b>20</b> can be elaborated. The dispatch file <b>30</b> is the primary file used by the automated dispatch processes to store information regarding a job and the status of a vehicle assigned to a job and to interact with other processes in the dispatching system.</p>
  <p num="p-0049">The exceptions file <b>32</b> contains pointers to the records in the dispatch file which cannot be handled by the automated dispatching processes <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, and must be managed by human dispatchers <b>16</b>, as well as an indication of the reasons for why the dispatch record requires human intervention. Software controlled by human dispatchers <b>16</b> reviews the exceptions file <b>32</b> to locate dispatch records requiring human intervention, so that the dispatcher <b>16</b> may evaluate the reasons for the exception and eliminate the problems encountered during automated dispatching. Once this is done, the human dispatcher may re-initiate automated dispatching and monitoring for that record.</p>
  <p num="p-0050">Invoice file <b>34</b> contains information for generating an invoice for the activities performed by vehicles <b>20</b> upon customer request. Invoice files <b>34</b> contain detailed information used to generate detailed invoices of the kind needed, for example, for federal and state Medicare and Medicaid agencies. As will be noted in detail below, the automated dispatching system has as a primary feature the automated collection of invoicing information so that this information is readily available for generation of invoices without further human involvement.</p>
  <p num="p-0051">Vehicle file <b>36</b> and employee file <b>38</b> are used to search and identify particular vehicle jobs and particular vehicle operators, as discussed below.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">Employee pager file <b>40</b> and pager service file <b>42</b> are used to page vehicle operators to alert the operators of new dispatching commands being transmitted to the vehicle.</p>
  <p num="p-0053">Automated dispatching requests file <b>44</b> and automated dispatching responses file <b>46</b> are used by communications process <b>24</b> to record and maintain communications between database server <b>10</b> and AVL system <b>18</b> in order to facilitate dispatching and vehicle monitoring operations being performed by dispatching process <b>26</b> and vehicle monitoring process <b>28</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">Automated dispatch setup file <b>48</b> and status limit file <b>49</b> are used by dispatching process <b>26</b> and vehicle monitoring process <b>28</b> to determine the desired behavior of these processes during dispatching and monitoring of vehicles, as elaborated below.</p>
  <p num="p-0055">FIGS. <b>3</b>A through <b>3</b>R-<b>2</b> illustrate specific file and data communications formats used in one embodiment of the present invention to generate and update the files illustrated generally in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Specifically, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates the format of records in dispatch file <b>30</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates the format of records in invoice file <b>34</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> illustrates the format of records in outbound vehicle file <b>36</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> illustrates the format of records in employee file <b>38</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref> illustrates the format of records in employee pager file <b>40</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref> illustrates the format of records in pager service file <b>42</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0056"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3G</figref> illustrates the format of records in automated dispatch requests file <b>44</b>. Each of these records includes a message packet key code, and a unique record identifier. The message packet key code indicates the particular type of message that follows, e.g., a closest vehicle request (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3K-1</figref>) has a record key code of 01, and a route request (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3L-1</figref>) has a record key code of 10, etc. The record identifier is used to distinguish each record from other records of the same type which may be found from time to time in the requests file <b>44</b>. The record identifier is generated from a combination of the ID number of the terminal (or process identifier of the process) generating the request, and transport ID number (which uniquely identifies the dispatch record for which the request is made) and a unique sequence number generated by the process <b>26</b> or <b>28</b> which generated the request. The key code and record identifier are followed by a message packet which can take one of a variety of formats. The specific formats, and their purposes, are illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3K-1</figref>, <b>3</b>L-<b>1</b>, <b>3</b>M-<b>1</b>, <b>3</b>N-<b>1</b>, <b>3</b>O-<b>1</b>, <b>3</b>P-<b>1</b>, <b>3</b>Q-<b>1</b> and <b>3</b>R-<b>1</b>, and will be elaborated below.</p>
  <p num="p-0057"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3H</figref> illustrates the format of records in automated dispatch responses file <b>46</b>, which are similar in general form to the requests in file <b>44</b>. Each automated dispatch response record includes a message packet key code and record identifier, followed by the message packet which may take one of a variety of formats. The formats of the message packets that may be included in an automated dispatch response record are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3K-2</figref>, <b>3</b>L-<b>2</b>, <b>3</b>M-<b>2</b>, <b>3</b>N-<b>2</b>, <b>3</b>O-<b>2</b>, <b>3</b>P-<b>2</b>, <b>3</b>Q-<b>2</b> and <b>3</b>R-<b>2</b>, and will be discussed below.</p>
  <p num="p-0058"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3I</figref> illustrates the format of records in automated dispatch setup file <b>48</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3J</figref> illustrates the format of records in the exceptions file <b>32</b>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3K</figref> illustrates the format of records in the status limit file <b>49</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">The use of the files illustrated in <b>3</b>A–<b>3</b>R-<b>2</b> will be illustrated in further detail below in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A–6B</figref>. Initially it should be noted that dispatch file records are generated by data entry call takers <b>12</b> or remote data entry terminals <b>14</b>, as part of requesting a vehicle service. When the data entry person at a terminal <b>12</b> or <b>14</b> creates the dispatch record, the terminal or server through which the person <b>12</b> or <b>14</b> is interacting generates a dispatch record of the format shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, and stores this record into database server <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0060">When a dispatch record is created, the data entry person indicates the customer for whom the services have been requested. This information is used to create the transport ID number, which is the first field of the dispatch record. The transport ID number is created by retrieving a code for the customer and appending to this code a sequential number. Accordingly, all of the dispatch records for a given company will have the same initial digits in their transport ID numbers. This is significant because the dispatch file <b>30</b> is sorted in accordance with transport ID numbers by database server <b>10</b>, such that those records for a given company will appear sequentially within dispatch file <b>30</b> and exception file <b>32</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">When a dispatch record is initially created by a data entry person <b>12</b> or <b>14</b>, the status flag field of the dispatch record is set to a “ ” character indicating that the dispatch job is prescheduled, i.e., has not yet been dispatched but has been requested.</p>
  <p num="p-0062">The data entry person <b>12</b> or <b>14</b> also enters the required date of service and appointment time at which vehicle service is desired. This information is stored respectively in the third and fourth field of the dispatch file record. The appointment time may be entered in military time format, or, if service is requested immediately (such as is the case with “911” ambulance service), the appointment time may be entered as “ASAP”, indicating that pickup is desired as soon as possible.</p>
  <p num="p-0063">Where a particular appointment time has been identified, the data entry person <b>12</b> or <b>14</b> may indicate a lead time for the appointment, which is a request that the vehicle be allotted additional time to arrive at the pickup location as compared to the ordinary dispatch. A lead time might be entered where the pickup location is an unusual distance away from the normal service area, and so additional time will be required to reach the pickup location. The data entry person <b>12</b> or <b>14</b> may enter the lead time, or alternatively, database server <b>10</b> or the software at data entry terminals operated by call takers <b>12</b> or remote data entry persons <b>14</b> may generate an estimate for the lead time, based on the pickup address, and store this in the dispatch file record. In either case, the lead time is stored in the fifth field of the dispatch file record.</p>
  <p num="p-0064">The pickup and destination addresses and their latitudes and longitudes are indicated in the tenth through fifteenth fields of the data record.</p>
  <p num="p-0065">Pickup and destination sites may be coded by the system so that, for example, frequent pickup sites such as hospitals are identified by entering a brief code, which automatically generates the corresponding address, latitude and longitude, and, if a pickup, an appropriate lead time (if any). This functionality would require an additional file (not shown) of pre-stored addresses, latitudes and longitudes, and lead times, indexed by codes that may be entered by a data entry person <b>12</b> or <b>14</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0066">The data entry person <b>12</b> or <b>14</b> also identifies particular information for the transport service. Specifically, the type of transport is indicated in the sixth field. The transport type may indicate any special requirements for the transport, depending upon the particular application. In the case of ambulance dispatch services, the transport type may indicate wheelchair or advanced life support, respectively indicating that an ambulette (a wheelchair-configured ambulance) can be used, or that an ambulance equipped for advanced life support is required.</p>
  <p num="p-0067">For ambulance service in particular, it is useful to fill out other fields at the time the dispatch record is created by a data entry person, such as the reasons for the transport (fields <b>24</b>–<b>27</b>), a patient ID number for indexing patient-specific information from a patient information file (not shown), the name of the caller or customer who requested the transport (field <b>29</b>), the contract number if a contract customer is requesting the services (field <b>30</b>), and codes for accessing additional files for billing information, such as the base rate, mileage rate, extra services rate, and billing address. This detailed billing information is particularly useful in an ambulance dispatching environment due to the level of detailed invoicing needed to satisfy health insurance and Medicare/Medicaid requirements to obtain reimbursement. By incorporating this information into a dispatching record at initiation, this information can be readily moved into an invoicing record after the task is completed and used for accurate and rapid billing for services without further human involvement.</p>
  <p num="p-0068">The dispatch record also includes a number of fields (fields <b>16</b>–<b>23</b>) for tracking the vehicle activity. These fields are filled out as the vehicle performs the desired task. This information is also extremely important for customer invoicing due to insurance and Government requirements, and therefore is also transferred to invoice records upon completion of the task. To start the process of collecting data for later use, at the time the dispatch record is initially created, the time of the call is recorded in field <b>16</b> of the dispatch record.</p>
  <p num="p-0069">It should be noted that the dispatch file format can be used readily to schedule vehicle services hours or days, or even weeks or months in advance but also to request vehicle services on an immediate basis. For example, to request services at a future date, the data entry person <b>12</b> or <b>14</b> need only put in the desired date of service into the third field of the record. To request services at a given time on today's date, the data entry person need only put in today's date of service in the third field and the desired appointment time in the fourth field. Finally, the data entry person <b>12</b> or customer <b>14</b> may request immediate ambulance service on an as soon as possible basis, by entering “ASAP” as the appointment time.</p>
  <p num="p-0070">Once a data entry person <b>12</b> or <b>14</b> creates a dispatch record as described above, the automated dispatch processes <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> will automatically cause a vehicle to be dispatched in accordance with the parameters set forth in the dispatch record, and will ensure that the vehicle arrives at pickup location approximately at the appointment time and arrives at the destination. As these events occur, the automated dispatch processes <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> fill out fields <b>16</b>–<b>23</b> of the dispatch record to indicate the time that the crew of the vehicle was notified, the time that they were dispatched with the specific instructions, the time that they responded and indicated that they were en route, the time that they arrived at the pickup site or scene, the time that they were en route to the destination, the time that they arrived at the destination, the time that they completed their task and reported themselves as available. In addition, the automated dispatch processes <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> will fill in the vehicle identification number and the driver and attendant employee numbers in the fields <b>7</b>–<b>9</b> of the dispatch record. As a result, all of this information is available to generate detailed invoices for delivery to the customer of sufficient detail to satisfy federal and state Medicare and Medicaid authorities.</p>
  <p num="p-0071">It will be noted that the dispatch records, which accumulate over time, include sufficient information to collectively determine the movements of each vehicle throughout each business day. Accordingly, these records can be collectively analyzed to determine the extent to which vehicles are being properly utilized and to potentially develop and revise marketing and vehicle positioning strategies for optimizing performance. Furthermore, these records may be used to generate detailed reports of nearly every format indicating the utilization of a particular vehicle, the on-time performance of a particular driver or crew, and any other kind of reporting information that management may seek in order to understand and improve operation of the dispatching operation. The analyses available through dispatching record are substantially more detailed and comprehensive than those that are supplied by AVL systems, since the AVL system can only rely on stored records of vehicle movements and cannot couple these to records of customer requests and response times, customer characteristics, and all of the other information available in dispatch files.</p>
  <p num="p-0072">It should also be noted that, in accordance with the invention, a single database server contains both the information on current vehicle positions and status, and information on future appointments for vehicle use. Because this information is collected in a single server, for the first time it is possible to perform status management procedures, to predict future needs for vehicles and prepare for those needs, by combining the present vehicle position and status information with known and predicted future appointments. A process performing a regular analysis of this kind can be extremely useful in predicting future bottlenecks in service and notifying human managers ahead of time, so that, for example, the human managers may bring in additional vehicles and crews, on overtime if needed, to avoid delays. Furthermore, the status management process might identify a need for an additional vehicle in a particular position and pre-dispatch the vehicle to a hold position where the vehicle will be more readily available to service future tasks.</p>
  <p num="p-0073">Another file worthy of initial comment is the outbound vehicle file <b>36</b>, the format of which is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. This file is automatically updated with records by the automated dispatch processes <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> whenever a vehicle is assigned to a given task. The records in this file indicate simply the vehicle's ID number and the transport ID number for the transport task to which the vehicle has been assigned. This file can then be used to identify, for a given vehicle, all of the transport tasks that have been completed by or are assigned to the vehicle. This can be useful in evaluating whether a given vehicle is available, or alternatively in evaluating the amount of work that has been done by a given vehicle and the paths followed by the vehicle during a given day.</p>
  <p num="p-0074">Another file of note is the employee file <b>38</b>, the format of which is seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>. This file contains records, each of which indicates the ID number and the employee's name. This file is useful for displaying employee names when a dispatcher <b>16</b> must handle an exception condition <b>10</b> which has been identified by the automated dispatch. Furthermore, this file may be used when generating invoices to indicate employee's names rather than their ID numbers.</p>
  <p num="p-0075">The automated dispatch setup file <b>48</b>, <b>15</b>, records of which are illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3I</figref>, indicates setup parameters for the automatic dispatch processes <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> on a company-by-company basis. The use of this file permits the automated dispatch system to provide different performance or different behaviors for different companies who request vehicle services from the automated dispatching system. Each record includes the company code of the company for the settings in the record. And the second field includes a dispatch advanced action setting, which is a time in minutes that the automatic dispatch system uses to determine when a vehicle should be dispatched for an appointment, as discussed below in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The third field of the setup file records is a flag to indicate whether the automated dispatch system should monitor vehicle status updates to determine if a vehicle status update is late in being received, as discussed below in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Finally, the fourth and fifth fields of the setup records indicate the specific AVL operating system and AVL port locking file, for the automatic vehicle locating system being used for the particular customer. This permits different automatic vehicle locating systems to be used for different customers, and potentially allows different fleets of vehicles to be dispatched with a single automated dispatching site through the use of different AVL systems and/or different AVL access ports.</p>
  <p num="p-0076">The exception file illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3J</figref> includes, as noted below, the transport ID numbers for dispatch records which have been marked for human intervention, along with codes indicating the reasons that the records were marked for human intervention.</p>
  <p num="p-0077">The status limit file shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3K</figref> includes fields used to customize the performance of the automated dispatching system for a given customer. Most importantly, this file indicates the time limits for which a vehicle may remain at a given status during performance of an automatically dispatched task. The use of these fields will be discussed below. Also, this file may contain fields (not shown) indicating particular codes or keywords used by dispatcher as a shorthand for a vehicle status conditions (e.g., “vehicle is 20” meaning the vehicle is en route-to the pickup), so that different codes or keywords may be used in screen displays and in communications for different fleets of vehicles.</p>
  <p num="p-0078">Now turning to the detailed functions of the automatic dispatching processes <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is an illustration of the dispatching processes <b>26</b>. At the beginning of this process, the dispatch file <b>30</b> is opened <b>50</b> to permit evaluation of dispatch requests added to the dispatch file by call takers <b>12</b> or <b>14</b>. Next, the dispatching process <b>26</b> extracts <b>52</b> individual records such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> from the dispatch file.</p>
  <p num="p-0079">The records from the dispatch file are processed sequentially in a loop beginning with step <b>54</b>, at which a dispatch record is obtained from the results of the extracting step <b>52</b>. This loop includes a sequence of steps illustrated in the remainder of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0080">First, dispatching process <b>26</b> determines <b>56</b> if it has reached the end of the dispatch file. If the dispatcher has reached the end of the dispatch file, it returns to step <b>52</b> to re-extract records from the dispatch file and begin again at the beginning of the file. If the dispatching process <b>26</b> has not reached the end of the dispatch file, it proceeds to step <b>58</b> to determine whether the currently selected record is identified by the exception file <b>32</b> (this involves looking through the records {FIG. <b>3</b>J} in the exception file <b>32</b> to locate any records having the same transport ID number as the current dispatch record). If the currently selected record is identified by the exception file <b>32</b>, this indicates that there has been an unrecoverable error during automatic dispatching and monitoring of this record, and therefore it has been referred to human dispatchers <b>16</b> for handling. Therefore, if the current record is in the exception file, the dispatching process returns to step <b>54</b> to get a new dispatching record.</p>
  <p num="p-0081">If the dispatching record is not in the exception file, dispatching process <b>26</b> continues to step <b>60</b> and determines the status of the dispatch record by checking the second field of the record as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. If the record has the status “prescheduled”, indicated by a “ ” in the second field of the record, this indicates that the transportation task described by the record has yet to be dispatched. In this case, the dispatching process <b>26</b> continues to step <b>62</b> to determine whether the record should be dispatched at the present time. If the record is not prescheduled, then as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the record has either been dispatched or it has been cancelled or the job has been completely finished. In any of these cases, the record is no longer in need of dispatching, and therefore dispatching process <b>26</b> returns to step <b>54</b> to get a new dispatch record.</p>
  <p num="p-0082">If a prescheduled record has been located which is not in the exception file, then the dispatching process <b>26</b> continues to step <b>62</b> at which it determines which company or customer the record relates to.</p>
  <p num="p-0083">Each dispatching process <b>26</b> is associated with a particular company or client and performs only dispatching for this one company or client and ignores any dispatching records in dispatch file <b>30</b> which relate to other companies or clients. The dispatching process <b>26</b> determines the company or client for which it is responsible from an automated dispatch setup file <b>48</b> which, as noted above with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3I</figref>, indicates a company code that the automated dispatch processes are to operate upon.</p>
  <p num="p-0084">Thus, in step <b>62</b>, dispatching process <b>26</b> determines whether the currently selected record is for the current company. If not, the dispatching process skips the current record and will not dispatch it, and returns to step <b>54</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0085">If the dispatching process <b>26</b> locates a record which is not in the exception file, is prescheduled, and is for the current company, then it determines if the job represented by the dispatch record should be initiated. If the dispatch record is marked “ASAP” in the fourth field, then the job should be dispatched immediately and the dispatching process <b>26</b> proceeds directly to step <b>66</b>. Otherwise, the dispatching process determines if the time has arrived to schedule the job. This is determined by comparing the current time to (a) the appointment time indicated in the fourth field of the dispatch record, (b) the lead time indicated in the fifth field of the dispatch record, and (c) the advance action time indicated in the second field of the setup file record for the current company as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3I</figref>. If the appointment time, minus the lead time, minus the advance action time, is earlier than the current time, this indicates that the job should be initiated and a vehicle should be dispatched to meet the appointment, and the dispatching process <b>26</b> proceeds to step <b>66</b>. If not, the dispatching process skips the record by returning to step <b>54</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0086">If the current dispatch record is to be dispatched by the dispatching process <b>26</b> as determined in step <b>64</b>, the dispatching process proceeds to step <b>66</b> and requests from the AVL system <b>18</b> a list of the N closest vehicles which are capable of handling the job. This is done by adding a automated dispatch request to the automated dispatch requests file <b>44</b>, using the format shown generally in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3H</figref> and specifically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3K-1</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0087">To generate the request shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3K-1</figref>, dispatch process <b>26</b> uses the transport ID number and the terminal number displaying the results of the dispatch process <b>26</b>, or the processor number running the dispatch process <b>26</b>, to generate a record ID as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3K-1</figref>. The record ID is made unique by appending a three digit sequence number to the transport number and terminal number. In addition, dispatching process <b>26</b> extracts the transport type identified in the sixth field of the current dispatch record (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) and places this transport type into the automated dispatch request in the third field, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3K-1</figref>. In addition, the dispatching process <b>26</b> retrieves the pickup address location from the tenth field of the dispatch record (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) and inserts this address information into the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh fields of the automated dispatch request message shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3K-1</figref>. Finally, the dispatching process <b>26</b> identifies the number N of vehicles to be identified by the AVL system <b>18</b> in response to the request and inserts this number in the eighth field of the automated dispatch request as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3K-1</figref>. For error correction purposes, a cyclic redundancy code (CRC) is added to the end of the automated dispatching request as shown at the end of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3K-1</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0088">After placing the appropriately formatted request in the automated dispatch requests file <b>44</b>, dispatching process <b>26</b> waits for a response to appear in the automated dispatch-responses file <b>46</b>. (The mechanism for delivering the request to the AVL system <b>18</b>, obtaining a response from AVL system <b>18</b>, and placing this response in the automatic dispatch responses file <b>46</b>, will be discussed below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>. For the purposes of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, this operation is completed in background and a response can be found in automated dispatch responses file <b>46</b> after a sufficient period of time.) When a response is found in automated dispatch responses file <b>46</b> (step <b>68</b>), dispatching process <b>26</b> proceeds to step <b>70</b> to evaluate the response received. (The response is deleted from the responses file once it has been read in step <b>68</b>.)</p>
  <p num="p-0089">In step <b>70</b>, dispatching process <b>26</b> scans the particular vehicles identified by the AVL response to locate a vehicle which is currently available. This is done by using the vehicle identification numbers returned from the AVL system to look for a record in the outbound vehicle file <b>36</b>. If a record for the vehicle is found in the outbound vehicle file, then the vehicle is not available and the dispatching process must check another vehicle.</p>
  <p num="p-0090">If, after evaluating all of the vehicles identified by the AVL, no available vehicles are located, the dispatching process is unable to automatically dispatch the current job and must request human intervention. In this case, the dispatching process proceeds to step <b>80</b> at which it writes the an exception record to the exception file (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3J</figref>), indicating the transport ID number of the current dispatch record and a reason code indicating that the automated dispatching failed because of the absence of an available vehicle. Subsequently, a human dispatcher <b>16</b> will evaluate the dispatch record and take the appropriate action, for example, calling individual vehicles to ensure that they have in fact not completed their current assignments, or, calling the customer who requested the job to inform them that a vehicle will be dispatched late for the pickup. After writing a record to an exception file in step <b>80</b>, dispatching process <b>26</b> moves on to the next record in the dispatch file by proceeding to step <b>54</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0091">If an available vehicle is located in step <b>70</b>, dispatching process <b>26</b> proceeds to step <b>72</b> at which it updates the current dispatch record by inserting the identification of the current vehicle and the identification of the crew (i.e., driver and attendant). This information is inserted into the seventh through ninth fields of the dispatch record. Second, the dispatch record is marked as dispatched by storing a “D” into the second field of the record. Third, the dispatching process stores the current time in the seventeenth field of the dispatching record to indicate when the crew was notified of the assignment. Finally, dispatching process <b>26</b> updates the outbound vehicle file record for the selected vehicle to associate the vehicle with the transport ID number of the current dispatch record, for later reference.</p>
  <p num="p-0092">Next, the dispatching process <b>26</b> proceeds to step <b>74</b>, at which it prepares to notify the crew of the new assignment. To do so, the dispatching process <b>26</b> pages the driver, by using the driver's mobile pager to inform the driver that a new job has been assigned to him. Initially, the dispatching process <b>26</b> creates data to be transmitted to the pager, which may include a simple code to indicate that a new job has been assigned to the driver, or may include more involved data including the pickup location and/or the appointment time. The amount of data to be transmitted to the pager is determined from the kind of paging system in use. When a simple telephone-number-only pager system is used, a simple code is transmitted, whereas when a full text pager is used, more information may be transmitted. A voice-mail pager might also be used, in which case a voiced message would be delivered by the pager.</p>
  <p num="p-0093">To transmit the page, the dispatching process <b>26</b> initiates a loop in which it repeatedly attempts to transmit the page to the paging service. This loop is repeated a given number, for example, three times to permit ample opportunity for the page to be accurately transmitted to the paging service. The number of retries for paging, and for other activities discussed below, may be hard-coded into the software or may be stored as a parameter in setup file <b>48</b>. For the purposes of the following discussion, it will be assumed that the number or retries is three, regardless of how this value is determined by the software.</p>
  <p num="p-0094">A page counter is initialized in step <b>74</b> to count the number of repetitions in this loop. In step <b>76</b>, (now referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>) this pager counter is incremented. In step <b>78</b>, dispatching process <b>26</b> determines of the counter has exceeded the maximum number permitted. If the counter has exceeded the maximum number the dispatching process proceeds to step <b>80</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) to write a record to the exception file indicating the transport ID number of the current dispatch record, and a reason code indicating that the unrecoverable error was due to a failure to communicate a page to the paging service.</p>
  <p num="p-0095">However, if the dispatching process has not already paged the driver three times, it proceeds to page the driver by referencing the employee pager file shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref> to determine the pager service and personal identification number and telephone number used to page the employee who is identified as the driver in field <b>8</b> of the dispatch record. The pager service associated with the employee in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref> is then used to select a record from the pager service file <b>42</b> corresponding to the pager service to which the employee subscribes. The dispatching process <b>26</b> then reads from the pager service file the pager service modem number, the login ID, password, baud rate, word length, stop bits and modem script that can be used to access the employee's pager service. This information is then used to control a modem to dial the employee's pager service and transmit a message to the pager service indicating that the employee should be paged and notified of the new job assigned to the employee.</p>
  <p num="p-0096">If the paging operation is successful, this is determined in step <b>82</b> and processing proceeds to step <b>84</b> to begin generation and delivery of a route. However, if the paging operation fails for one reason or another, for example, because a modem has failed, or because the line at the pager service was busy when dialed, then dispatching procedure <b>26</b> returns to step <b>76</b> to increment the pager counter and make another attempt to page the employee. After three attempts have been made, as noted above, dispatching procedure <b>26</b> proceeds from step <b>78</b> directly to step <b>80</b> and writes the record into the exception file with an indication that paging was not completed.</p>
  <p num="p-0097">It should be noted that the most typical cause of a failure to communicate a page to the paging service is a faulty modem. There may, however, be other problems not associated with the modem. For this reason, in an alternative embodiment of the dispatching process, the process might proceed to the subsequent steps described below (including preparing a mobile terminal message to the vehicle) despite a failure to initiate a page of the vehicle. This redundant communication to the vehicle reduces the opportunity for a vehicle to miss receipt of a command.</p>
  <p num="p-0098">It should also be noted that there are some paging services that will confirm receipt of a page at the pager; this kind of service can be important in vehicle dispatching since it prevents the driver from neglecting his/her duties and then claiming that the page was not received. If the paging service provides receipts, these might be detected and logged, for example by an additional background process having the sole purpose of collecting and logging receipts. Separating this function into a separate background process would avoid delays of the main processes while waiting for receipts. Such a background process could also perform step <b>104</b> discussed below, which awaits confirmation of an MDT message, and thereby further eliminate delay of the main process.</p>
  <p num="p-0099">If paging is completed successfully, dispatching procedure <b>26</b> proceeds to step <b>84</b> at which it initializes a route counter. This counter is used in connection with a loop including steps <b>86</b>–<b>92</b>, in which the dispatching procedure attempts to generate a route for delivery to the selected vehicle's driver.</p>
  <p num="p-0100">In this loop, at step <b>86</b>, dispatching procedure <b>26</b> increments the route counter and at step <b>88</b>, dispatching procedure <b>26</b> determines whether the route counter is greater than three (for example). If the route counter is greater than three, then the dispatching procedure <b>26</b> has made three failed attempts to obtain a route from the AVL system <b>18</b> and therefore determines that an unrecoverable error has occurred during automated dispatching. In this case, the dispatching procedure proceeds to step <b>80</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) and writes the current transport ID number to an exception record along with a reason code indicating that automatic dispatching failed due to failure to obtain a route from the AVL.</p>
  <p num="p-0101">If however, the dispatching procedure has not yet tried three times to obtain a route, the dispatching procedure proceeds to step <b>90</b> and initiates a request to be sent to the AVL system <b>18</b> to obtain a route for the driver to his assigned destination. To do this, the dispatching procedure <b>26</b> generates an automated dispatch request record having the general format illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3G</figref>, and stores this record into the automated dispatch request file <b>44</b>. The specific format of the automated dispatch request is shown specifically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3L-1</figref>. As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3L-1</figref>, the route request includes the vehicle identification number for the vehicle selected to service the dispatch request, as well as the pickup address, city, state and zip code, and destination address, city, state and zip code. The pickup and destination addresses are obtained from the tenth and thirteenth fields in the dispatch record. In addition, the dispatching procedure <b>26</b> includes a cyclic redundancy code at the end of the-request as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3L-1</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0102">The AVL system <b>18</b> includes algorithms to derive routing for drivers from identified pickup points to identified destination points. These algorithms will respond to the information in the request shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3L-1</figref>, and generate a response of the kind illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3L-2</figref>. This response includes a record identifier which is identical to the record identifier in the request in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3L-1</figref>, followed by a route string, which is a text string indicating a list of street names, of streets to be followed along a best route from the pickup address to the destination address.</p>
  <p num="p-0103">Under normal operation, the AVL system will produce a response of the kind shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3L-2</figref> within a predetermined period of time. Accordingly, dispatching procedure <b>26</b> waits for this predetermined period of time and then proceeds to step <b>92</b> at which it determines if a route has been received from the AVL system by scanning the contents of the automated dispatch responses file <b>46</b> for a record having the same record ID as was incorporated into the request of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3L-1</figref>. If no response is received within this time period, then automated dispatching procedure <b>26</b> re-requests a route by returning to step <b>86</b>. However, if a route has been received, automated dispatching procedure (after deleting the response from responses file <b>46</b>) proceeds to step <b>94</b> in which it creates a mobile data terminal message for the selected vehicle, incorporating the routing directions returned from the AVL system, and also incorporating any additional information of use to the driver which might be incorporated into the dispatch file records when the dispatch file records are created by call takers <b>12</b> or remote data entry terminals <b>14</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0104">One specific format for the mobile data terminal message is illustrated specifically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3M-1</figref>. The mobile data terminal request incorporates much of the data in the dispatch record, including the transport identification number (field <b>4</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3M-1</figref>) the date of service (field <b>5</b>), the appointment time (field <b>6</b>) and the transport type (field <b>7</b>). Also included is patient information including the patient's name and phone number (fields <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>); this information is obtained by referencing a patient information file (not shown) using the patient ID found in field <b>28</b> of the dispatch record.</p>
  <p num="p-0105">Also included in the mobile data terminal records are the pickup city, street address, state and zip code and the destination street, city, state and zip code (fields <b>10</b>–<b>17</b>). Next are four text fields for identifying the reason for the transport; this data is derived from fields <b>24</b>–<b>27</b> of the dispatch record and is entered by the call takers <b>12</b> or the remote data entry terminals <b>14</b> for relaying to the drivers. Finally, various vehicle status information is transferred from fields <b>16</b>–<b>23</b> of the dispatch records to fields <b>22</b>–<b>30</b> of the mobile data terminal record, including the time of the call requesting vehicle service, the time the crew was notified, the time the crew was dispatched, the time the crew was confirmed as en route, the time the crew arrived at the pickup site, the time the crew was confirmed as en route to their destination, the time that they arrived at their destination and the time that they became available. Finally, in field <b>30</b>, the mobile data terminal message includes the route message for the route generated by the automated dispatching procedure in steps <b>90</b> and <b>92</b> as discussed above.</p>
  <p num="p-0106">To transmit data to the mobile data terminal, dispatching procedure <b>26</b> follows a third loop which re-tries three times (for example) to transmit to the mobile data terminal via the AVL system. In the first step <b>96</b>, dispatching procedure <b>26</b> initializes a mobile data terminal counter, and in a subsequent step <b>98</b>, dispatching procedure <b>26</b> increments this counter. After step <b>98</b>, dispatching procedure <b>26</b> determines <b>100</b> whether the mobile data terminal counter is greater than three, and, if so, proceeds to step <b>80</b> to write a record to the exception file with a reason code indicating that data transmission failed. In step <b>102</b>, dispatching procedure <b>26</b> stores the mobile data terminal request record, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3M-1</figref>, into the automated dispatch requests file <b>44</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0107">When the mobile data terminal information request has been placed into the automated dispatch requests file <b>44</b>, a communications process <b>24</b> (discussed below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>) forwards this request to the AVL system <b>18</b>. The AVL system in response transmits the mobile data terminal information to the vehicle. The vehicle driver then confirms receipt of the information to the AVL system and the AVL system acknowledges this response to a communications process <b>24</b> which then places a mobile data terminal response record into the automated dispatch responses file <b>46</b>. The format of this confirmation is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3M-2</figref>. It essentially includes the same record ID number as was used in the mobile data terminal request of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3M-1</figref>. When this confirmation is received in step <b>104</b>, dispatching process <b>26</b> deletes the response record from the responses file <b>46</b> and proceeds to step <b>106</b> to perform other dispatching activities. However, if this confirmation is not received after a predetermined period of time, dispatching process <b>26</b> proceeds to step <b>80</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) to write a record into the exception file <b>32</b> along with an indication that automated dispatching failed due to failure to reach the vehicle with a mobile data terminal message.</p>
  <p num="p-0108">If a mobile data terminal message is successfully sent to the vehicle and a confirmation is received in step <b>104</b>, then dispatching process <b>26</b> proceeds to step <b>106</b> in which it first stores the current time into the dispatch record as the time that the crew is dispatched (field <b>18</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0109">Next, the dispatching procedure <b>26</b> generates a request to the AVL system to determine the latitude and longitude of the vehicle. This is done by generating a request having the format shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3N-1</figref>. This request essentially includes the transport number and vehicle ID number (fields <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>) and the pickup and destination addresses (fields <b>5</b>–<b>12</b>). The dispatching process <b>26</b> does not wait for a reply to this latitude-longitude request, because such a reply can take, in many cases, an inordinate amount of time to be returned. Rather, dispatching process <b>26</b> proceeds directly from step <b>106</b> to step <b>54</b>, at which it gets a new dispatch record and begins processing the new dispatch record in the manner discussed above. When the latitude and longitude is ultimately returned, this data is incorporated into the dispatching record by a communications process <b>24</b> as is discussed in further detail below in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0110">It will be noted that, as a result of the foregoing procedure, whenever a vehicle is dispatched, the vehicle is immediately thereafter delivered a suggested route for the requested transit. This not only assists the driver if the driver enters unfamiliar territory, but also is a way to ensure that the vehicles follow recommended best routing.</p>
  <p num="p-0111">As is noted variously within this application, insurance and Governmental institutions have applied stringent requirements to ambulance carrier billing. One area that as yet is perhaps underregulated, however, is the mileage charged by the carrier. Governmental agencies could, and perhaps in the near future may, begin verifying the mileage charged by ambulance carriers by computing a route from the pickup to destination locations and comparing the mileage of the computed route to the mileage actually charged by the carrier. In the recent past, electronic invoicing for ambulance services has been used increasingly; this trend also facilitates automatic electronic verification of mileage charges.</p>
  <p num="p-0112">As noted above, it is one aspect of the present invention to automatically deliver, during vehicle dispatch, the exact route which will be used by Government or insurance agencies in verifying the mileage charges accumulated by the vehicle. Furthermore, it is a related aspect of the invention to automatically perform such verification upon an ambulance service invoice to determine if the mileage charges on the invoice are within parameters set by a Government or insurance agency.</p>
  <p num="p-0113">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the operations of the vehicle monitoring process <b>28</b> can be discussed in particular detail. The vehicle monitoring process is responsible for tracking and monitoring the activities of vehicles once they have been dispatched by one of the dispatching processes <b>26</b>. It operates in generally the same overall fashion as the dispatching processes <b>26</b>, by reviewing records in the dispatch file and acting on individual records when action appears to be needed. Accordingly, in the first step <b>120</b>, the vehicle monitoring process opens the dispatch file <b>30</b> and then extracts <b>122</b> the dispatch records from the dispatch file. Then, it gets <b>124</b> a particular record from the dispatch file for review. If the end of the dispatch file is reached in step <b>126</b>, the vehicle monitoring process returns to step <b>122</b> to re-extract the records from the file and re-analyze each record.</p>
  <p num="p-0114">If a record has been found and the end of file has not been reached, the vehicle monitoring process <b>28</b> moves on to step <b>128</b> and determines whether the current record is identified by a record in the exception file <b>32</b>. If the record is identified in the exception file, this indicates that the automated dispatching processes have found an irreconcilable error and have referred the dispatch job for human intervention. Accordingly, the vehicle monitoring process returns to step <b>124</b> to get a new dispatch record.</p>
  <p num="p-0115">If a record is found which is not in the exception file, the vehicle monitoring process <b>28</b> proceeds to step <b>130</b> and determines the status of the current dispatch record. If the record is marked as dispatched, then the vehicle monitoring process <b>28</b> is responsible for monitoring the status and progress of the vehicle in servicing the record. However, if the record status is not dispatched, then the vehicle monitoring process <b>28</b> is not concerned with the record and so returns to step <b>124</b> to get another record.</p>
  <p num="p-0116">If a record is found which is not in the exception file and is dispatched, the vehicle monitoring process then proceeds to step <b>132</b> to determine if the record is a record for the company or client being serviced by the vehicle monitoring process <b>28</b>. This is determined by accessing the automated dispatch setup file <b>48</b> and, in particular, field <b>1</b> of that file as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3I</figref>, which identifies the company code for the company currently being serviced by the automated dispatching system. This company code is then compared with the transport ID number in the first field of the dispatch record as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, which, as noted above, contains the company code. If the record is not related to the company currently being serviced by the automated dispatching system, the vehicle monitoring process skips the record by returning to step <b>124</b> and getting a new record.</p>
  <p num="p-0117">If, however, a record is found which is not in the exception file, is currently dispatched, and is a job for the current company, the vehicle monitoring process proceeds to step <b>134</b> at which it determines whether the vehicle assigned to the record has reported itself as arrived at its pickup site. This is determined by checking the value in the time crew arrived at pickup field, which is the 20th field in the dispatch record as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0118">One of the important functions of the vehicle monitoring process is to determine if a vehicle is late for arrival at its pickup site and, if so, to warn the human dispatchers <b>16</b> so that the appropriate action can be taken, for example, calling the customer to inform them that the vehicle will be late. Accordingly, if a vehicle has not reported as arrived, the vehicle monitoring process proceeds to steps <b>136</b> et seq. at which it determines if the vehicle is late.</p>
  <p num="p-0119">Initially, the monitoring process <b>28</b> determines simply whether the vehicle is late for arrival at the pickup site. To do so, process <b>28</b> first determines <b>136</b> whether the record is scheduled for a specific appointment time, or ASAP service. If the record is schedule for a specific appointment time, process <b>28</b> proceeds to step <b>137</b> to determine if the current time is later than the appointment time. If the current time is later than the appointment time, process <b>28</b> proceeds to step <b>160</b> to write a record to the exception file <b>32</b> including a reason code indicating that automated dispatching failed because the vehicle was late to the pickup site.</p>
  <p num="p-0120">If, however, at step <b>136</b>, monitoring process <b>28</b> determines that the record is an ASAP request, then it proceeds to step <b>138</b> to determine whether the vehicle is late. In step <b>138</b>, monitoring process <b>28</b> references the status limit file <b>44</b> to locate a status limit record (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3K</figref>) for the current company, and then reads the last field of this record to determine the “ASAP Limit” for the company. Then, process <b>28</b> compares the “ASAP Limit” to the difference between the current time and the time the ASAP request was received (as indicated in field <b>16</b>). If more time than is indicated by the ASAP Limit has elapsed since the call was received, then the vehicle is considered late and monitoring process <b>28</b> proceeds to step <b>160</b> to write a record in the exceptions file.</p>
  <p num="p-0121">If, however, in either steps <b>137</b> or <b>138</b>, the vehicle is not determined to be late, then monitoring process <b>28</b> proceeds to step <b>140</b>. At step <b>140</b>, monitoring process <b>28</b> determines whether the company it is servicing uses late status monitoring for its vehicles. This is determined by referencing the third field of the automated dispatch setup file which indicates whether status late activity is to be monitored or not. If status late activity is to be monitored, the vehicle monitoring process proceeds to step <b>142</b> at which it determines whether the vehicle is late in reporting its status.</p>
  <p num="p-0122">To determine if a vehicle is late in reporting its status, the monitoring process reviews the status times identified in fields <b>17</b> through <b>23</b> of the dispatch record to locate the most recent status reported by the vehicle. The vehicle status will be one of “notified”, “dispatched”, “en route to pickup”, “arrived at pickup”, “en route to destination”, “arrived at destination”, or “available”. Then, if the status is anything other than “available”, monitoring process <b>28</b> determines how long the vehicle has been at its current status by comparing the current time to most recent time in fields <b>17</b> through <b>22</b> of the dispatch record. Finally, the monitoring process <b>28</b> references the status limit file <b>49</b> to locate the status limit record (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3K</figref>) for the company to be serviced. From this record, the monitoring process <b>28</b> determines the status limit for the current vehicle's status. Finally, the time the vehicle has been at its current status is compared to the predefined limit for that status. If the vehicle has exceeded the predefined limit, then the monitoring process <b>28</b> proceeds to step <b>160</b> to write an exception record identifying the dispatch record and including a code indicating that the vehicle was late in its status reports.</p>
  <p num="p-0123">If the vehicle is not otherwise late, but has not arrived (i.e., if the vehicle passes from steps <b>134</b>, <b>140</b>, or <b>142</b>), then further analysis of the vehicle status may still be needed, because the pickup may have been cancelled by the customer at the pickup site, or the crew may have completed the job and reported itself as available. Thus, in the cases not discussed above, monitoring process <b>28</b> proceeds from steps <b>134</b>, <b>140</b> or <b>142</b> to step <b>144</b>, at which it determines whether the vehicle has reported itself as available. If not, monitoring process proceeds to step <b>124</b> to obtain a new dispatch record for processing.</p>
  <p num="p-0124">However, if the vehicle has reported itself as available, monitoring process <b>28</b> proceeds from step <b>144</b> to step <b>146</b>, at which it marks the status flag in the dispatch record (field <b>2</b>) with an “F” to indicate that the record has been finished. This action will disable any further dispatching on the dispatch record. At the same time, monitoring process <b>28</b> deletes the record in the outbound vehicle file <b>36</b> which associates the vehicle with the dispatch record. Doing will allow the vehicle to be recognized as available in step <b>70</b> of the dispatching process <b>26</b>, so that new tasks will be assigned to the vehicle.</p>
  <p num="p-0125">After these steps, the vehicle monitoring process proceeds to step <b>148</b> and generates an invoice record having the format shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, using the information in the dispatch record, and then writes the resulting invoice record to the invoice file <b>34</b> for later use in generating invoices for the services rendered by the vehicle. As can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the invoice record is generated by transferring various fields from the dispatch record into the new invoice record, including the transport ID number and date of service, the vehicle identification number and the driver and attendants' employee numbers, the pickup and destination, the reasons for transport and billing information, and the time of various activities including the time the dispatch request was received, the time the crew was notified, dispatched, reported as en route to pickup, reported as arrived, reported as en route to its destination, and reported as available upon completion of the job. This detailed information and other information discussed above is important in satisfying insurance companies and federal or state agencies who demand detailed billing for compensation for transportation services.</p>
  <p num="p-0126">The information in the invoice record may be used to print an invoice for mailing without further human intervention. Or, alternatively, the information might be used to generate and transmit an electronic invoice for services, leading to electronic payment, such that the entire transaction may be completed in a paperless manner without postage expense and handling, and the resulting delays and risks of loss. Another alternative is that the invoice records might be transmitted to customer sites (those having remote data entry persons <b>14</b> {FIG. <b>1</b>}), to print an invoice at the customer site for delivery. Again, postage expense, delay, and risk of loss are reduced or eliminated through direct electronic billing.</p>
  <p num="p-0127">After generating a suitable invoice record, the vehicle monitoring procedure proceeds to step <b>150</b> at which it notifies the automatic vehicle locator system <b>18</b> that the vehicle is now available. The automatic vehicle locator system <b>18</b> retains internal tables indicating the status of each of the vehicles that it tracks, so that it may for example display the status of vehicles and their locations for a human dispatcher <b>16</b>, or may produce reports of vehicle activity and vehicle availability.</p>
  <p num="p-0128">The AVL system is notified of a new vehicle status by an automated dispatch request having the general format shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3G</figref> which is stored into the automatic dispatch requests file <b>44</b> and forwarded to the AVL system by the communications process as discussed below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>. The specific format of the AVL transport status update is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3O-1</figref>, and includes various information from the dispatching record, including the vehicle ID number, the transport ID number, the transport type, the appointment time, AVL system code for the new transport status, and the time at which this status became effective, the driver and attendant employee numbers, the patient's name and the pickup and destination addresses.</p>
  <p num="p-0129">After thus notifying the AVL that a vehicle is available, the vehicle monitoring process <b>28</b> returns to step <b>124</b> to get a new dispatch record.</p>
  <p num="p-0130">It will be noted that the monitoring process described above relies on the vehicle operators to update their status regularly as they proceed through an assigned task. While this is an effective system for updating status, others might be used. For example, to determine whether a vehicle is en route, the monitoring process might compare two recent position readings for the vehicle to determine whether the vehicle is moving. To determine whether a vehicle is at the pickup or destination site, the monitoring process might simply compare the position of the vehicle to the position of the pickup and destination site. If such an approach is taken it is important to use highly accurate navigation tools, to discriminate a vehicle which is at the pickup site from a vehicle which is caught at a traffic light one block away from the pickup site. However, it is believed that these obstacles can be overcome and monitoring performed with even less human involvement than is described above.</p>
  <p num="p-0131">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, the communications process <b>24</b> can be more completely understood. The communications process reads requests from the automated dispatch request file <b>44</b>, generates the appropriate communications to the AVL system <b>18</b>, and also reads responses from the AVL system <b>18</b> and produces response records and stores them into automated dispatch responses file <b>46</b> so that the response records can then be evaluated by dispatching process <b>26</b> or vehicle monitoring process <b>26</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0132">To initialize itself, the communications process <b>24</b> opens <b>170</b>, a communications port to the AVL system <b>18</b> and also opens the requests file <b>44</b> and responses file <b>46</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0133">The first part of the communications process illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is responsible for reading requests from the requests file <b>44</b> and generating communications to the AVL system <b>18</b> through the AVL port. Accordingly, in this portion of the communications process <b>24</b>, the communications process reads a record from the request file (step <b>172</b>). If at step <b>174</b> the end of the request file is reached, the communications process proceeds to step <b>190</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>) to evaluate responses. If, however, the end of the file has not been reached, the communications process proceeds to step <b>176</b> and writes the information from the current record to the AVL port. Then, the communications process performs a loop in which it waits for an acknowledgment from the AVL system <b>18</b>. This loop is repeated three times (for example) as determined by a counter which is initialized to zero in step <b>178</b>. If an acknowledgment is received in step <b>180</b>, the communications process then deletes the request record from the requests file (step <b>181</b>, and proceeds to step <b>190</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>) to handle responses from the AVL. However, if no response is received, the communications process increments the counter (step <b>182</b>) and then determines whether the counter has been incremented above a value of two (step <b>184</b>). If the counter has not yet reached a value of two in step <b>184</b>, the communications process returns to step <b>180</b> to determine if an acknowledgment has yet been received.</p>
  <p num="p-0134">However, if the counter exceeds the value of two (for example), then the AVL communication has failed. In this situation, the communications process proceeds to step <b>186</b> in which it generates an exception record based on the request and then writes the exception record to the exception file (step <b>188</b>) to refer the situation to a human dispatcher <b>16</b>. The exception record includes a code indicating that automated dispatch failed in attempting to communicate with the AVL.</p>
  <p num="p-0135">After steps <b>174</b>, <b>181</b> or <b>188</b>, the communications process arrives at step <b>190</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. At this step and in the subsequent steps, the communications process attempts to read information from the AVL system <b>18</b> and prepare the appropriate response records for use by the dispatching process <b>26</b> or vehicle monitoring process <b>28</b>. If the AVL port times out <b>192</b> before a response is received, then the communications process simply returns to step <b>172</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>) to locate records in the requests file, if any, and act on those records.</p>
  <p num="p-0136">If, however, information is received from the AVL port, the communications process <b>24</b> evaluates the information received from the AVL port to determine what kind of message is being received and to take the appropriate action. For example, if a request for status information is received, this is determined in step <b>194</b> and handled in steps <b>196</b> and <b>198</b>. If mobile data terminal information is received, this is determined in step <b>197</b> and handled in steps <b>199</b>–<b>204</b>. If an updated status is received from a vehicle, this is determined in step <b>206</b> and handled in steps <b>208</b>–<b>214</b>. If a latitude and longitude for a vehicle is returned from the AVL, this is determined in step <b>216</b> and handled in steps <b>218</b>–<b>222</b>. Other responses from the AVL are handled in step <b>224</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0137">A request for status information may be generated unilaterally by the AVL to update its internal tables of vehicle status information. Such a request is received by the communications process in the form shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3P-1</figref>. The request includes a record identification number which is equal to the vehicle identification number for which the status is requested. To respond to this request, the communications process accesses the dispatch record for the job currently being handled by the vehicle identified by the vehicle ID number in the request for status information. This is done by referencing the outbound vehicle file <b>36</b> to determine the transport ID number associated with the vehicle ID number. Then, this transport ID number is used to retrieve the dispatch record from the dispatch file <b>30</b> having this transport ID number. Then, in step <b>198</b> this dispatch record is used to generate a response to the AVL identifying the status of the vehicle. This response takes the form illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3P-2</figref> and includes the vehicle identification number, the transport record identifier, the type of the vehicle, its current appointment time, its status and the time that its status was last updated, the driver and attendant employee numbers, the patient's name and the pickup and destination addresses. This output record is then returned to the AVL system <b>18</b> by proceeding directly to step <b>176</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> and writing the contents of this record to the AVL port.</p>
  <p num="p-0138">Mobile data terminal information may be transmitted unilaterally from the AVL system <b>18</b>, in response to an entry of updated information into a mobile data terminal by a vehicle driver. When the vehicle driver transmits amendments to mobile data terminal information, these amendments are received by the AVL system <b>18</b> and then forwarded to the communications process <b>24</b>. The format of the information received from the mobile data terminal is the same as the format of the information transmitted to a mobile data terminal as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3M-1</figref>, with the exception that a route message is not returned from the mobile data terminal. The resulting record format is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3Q-1</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0139">To respond to mobile data terminal information received from the AVL, the communications process reads the transport identification number from the fourth field in the mobile data terminal information and uses this identifier to locate the dispatch record associated with the transport identification number in the dispatch file <b>30</b>. Then the communications process reads this dispatch record (step <b>199</b>) and updates the fields of the dispatch record in response to the mobile data terminal information received from the AVL system <b>19</b>. For example, the ambulance crew may have updated the address of the pickup or destination, or may have added reasons for the transport or diagnostic information. After updating the dispatch fields <b>200</b>, the communications process writes <b>202</b> the amended dispatch record into the dispatch file <b>30</b>. Finally, the communications process acknowledges receipt of the transmission from the AVL system by generating a brief receipt message as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3Q-2</figref>. This message includes the record ID of the incoming mobile data terminal message and the vehicle identification number. The acknowledge message of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3Q-2</figref> is then transmitted to the AVL system by proceeding directly to step <b>176</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0140">Updated status information may be received from vehicles unilaterally at many points during their performance of assigned duties. For example, when the vehicle wishes to confirm that it is en route to its pick-up, it may use its mobile data terminal to send a status update message to the automated dispatch system. Furthermore, when the vehicle becomes available, it may send a different status message. These status messages are received by the AVL system and then forwarded to the automated dispatch system and received by communications process <b>24</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0141">Status messages may be prepared by typing information to the mobile data terminal. Or the mobile data terminal may be voice activated and controlled so that the driver and/or crew can control it hands-free while driving.</p>
  <p num="p-0142">When a received updated status message is identified in step <b>206</b>, the communications process first reads the updated status message to determine the associated dispatch record. The format of an updated status message is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3R-1</figref>. The format includes a record identifier which includes the transport identification number and vehicle identification number. This record identifier is used to locate and read <b>208</b> the dispatch record based on the transport identification number. Next, the communications process <b>24</b> uses the status level identified in the third field of the status change message to update the status fields (fields <b>18</b>–<b>23</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) in the dispatch record (step <b>210</b>). Next, the dispatch record with updated status fields is written <b>212</b> back to the server <b>10</b> with the updated status information. Finally, an acknowledgement message of the form shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3R-2</figref> is generated by the communications process and delivered to the AVL system by proceeding directly to step <b>176</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0143">Another type of message which may be regularly received by the automated dispatch system is the latitude and longitude of a vehicle, as is requested by the dispatching process <b>26</b> in step <b>106</b>. In response to this request, the AVL system <b>19</b> will return a response having the format shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3N-2</figref>. The response includes a record identifier indicating the transport number, terminal number and sequence number supplied in the request shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3N-1</figref>. Furthermore, the response indicates the latitude and longitude of the pickup address and destination address supplied in the request message.</p>
  <p num="p-0144">In handling a latitude/longitude response, the communications process first uses the transport identification number in the response to locate the dispatch record and to read <b>218</b> this dispatch record. Next, the communications process updates <b>220</b> the latitude and longitude fields (fields <b>11</b>–<b>12</b> and <b>14</b>–<b>15</b>) in the dispatch record. Finally, the communications process writes <b>222</b> the amended dispatch record so that the latitude/longitude information is available for later use then, the communications process returns to step <b>172</b> to begin evaluation of records in the requests file <b>44</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0145">Additional forms of responses may be handled by communications process <b>24</b>. In particular, the response from the AVL which indicates the closest vehicles requested by a dispatching process (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3K-2</figref>) is handled by writing a corresponding record to the responses file <b>46</b> in step <b>224</b>. Similar actions are taken to store a response of the kind shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3L-2</figref> which indicates a route for a vehicle to a destination. Also, step <b>224</b> stores responses of the kind shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3M-2</figref> which indicate a confirmation of a MDT message.</p>
  <p num="p-0146">The communications process of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> may also be used to transmit and receive “manual” message packets, i.e., manually generated, non-standard messages which are exchanged between a human dispatcher <b>16</b> and the driver of a vehicle <b>20</b>, particularly during exceptional situations. To perform such transmissions, a dispatcher <b>16</b> may use software to generate a suitable request message and store this request message in the automated dispatch request file <b>44</b>. Furthermore, a driver may type (or voice-enter) a generic text message into a message data terminal and transmit it to the AVL system which will in response produce a generic text message that may be stored by communications process <b>24</b> in step <b>224</b> for review by a dispatcher <b>16</b>. Thus, any software used by the dispatcher to monitor exception conditions and respond to those conditions, may use the automated data transfer capabilities of the communications process <b>24</b> to facilitate these communications.</p>
  <p num="p-0147">While the present invention has been illustrated by a description of various embodiments and while these embodiments have been described in considerable detail, it is not the intention of the applicants to restrict or in any way limit the scope of the appended claims to such detail. Additional advantages and modifications will readily appear to those skilled in the art.</p>
  <p num="p-0148">For example, one might include a field in each record of the automated dispatch file (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3I</figref>), to indicate those customers for whom automated dispatching is to be performed. Doing so would add flexibility by, for example, permitting management to make a policy decision not to perform automated dispatching for a given customer or contract. To implement this, the dispatching process <b>26</b> illustrated below in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> would need to be modified so that, in the initial series of tests <b>56</b>–<b>62</b>, the dispatching process determines whether automated dispatching was enabled for the current company, and if not, immediately moves to step <b>80</b> to write the current record in the exceptions file for manual dispatching.</p>
  <p num="p-0149">Furthermore, methods and apparatus described herein could be used for any kind of vehicles, not limited for example to taxis and ambulances. For example, shipping traffic, whether by land (e.g., semitrailers), sea (e.g., freighters) or air (e.g., cargo planes) could be dispatched and monitored-under principles of the present invention. Moreover, land, sea or air traffic control could in general be performed in a fully automated manner using principles of the present invention. One particularly fruitful area is the ground traffic control of ground vehicles and airplanes at airport facilities; typically movements of ground vehicles and airplanes on the airport tarmac are controlled by human dispatchers using their visual information and/or radar systems, which system is prone to failures such as recently experienced at the Denver airport.</p>
  <p num="p-0150">Data gathered from vehicles might not be limited to the vehicles position and status; in addition, the system might gather information on whether the vehicle is moving, the velocity of the vehicle, whether the vehicle is braking, the fuel usage of the vehicle, whether emergency signals of the vehicle are operating, and whether the engine is idling. This data could be used to determine, for example, whether the vehicle is caught in traffic or moving smoothly to its destination. Furthermore, the system might detect situations where the vehicle is being used inappropriately, for example, a situation where the crew is between tasks and has left the engine idling for a long period of time. Two-way communication with the MDT might be enhanced, for example, to permit the central station to control actions of the vehicle, e.g., switch the vehicle's engine off. This function could be particularly useful as a theft prevention.</p>
  <p num="p-0151">All of these embodiments, and others, are within the spirit and scope of the invention. The invention in its broader aspects is therefore not limited to the specific details, representative apparatus and method, and illustrative example shown and described. Accordingly, departures may be made from such details without departing from the spirit or scope of applicant's general inventive concept.</p>
