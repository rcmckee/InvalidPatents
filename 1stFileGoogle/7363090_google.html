The band stop filter includes a capacitor in parallel with an inductor. The parallel capacitor and inductor are placed in series with the implantable lead wire of the AIMD, wherein values of capacitance and inductance are selected such that the band stop filter is resonant at a selected frequency. The Q of the inductor may be relatively maximized and the Q of the capacitor may be relatively minimized to reduce the overall Q of the band stop filter to attenuate current flow through the implantable lead wire along a range of selected frequencies. In a preferred form, the band stop filter is integrated into a TIP and/or RING electrode for the active implantable medical device.</div>

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0002">This invention relates generally to novel EMI tank filter assemblies, particularly of the type used in active implantable medical devices (AIMDs) such as cardiac pacemakers, cardioverter defibrillators, neurostimulators, and the like, which decouple implantable lead wires and/or electronic components of the implantable medical device from undesirable electromagnetic interference (EMI) signals at a selected frequency or frequencies, such as the RF pulsed fields of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) equipment.</p>
    <p num="p-0003">Compatibility of cardiac pacemakers, implantable defibrillators and other types of active implantable medical devices with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other types of hospital diagnostic equipment has become a major issue. If one goes to the websites of the major cardiac pacemaker manufacturers in the United States, which include St. Jude Medical, Medtronic and Boston Scientific (formerly Guidant), one will see that the use of MRI is generally contra-indicated with pacemakers and implantable defibrillators.

    <p num="p-0005">However, an extensive review of the literature indicates that MRI is indeed often used with pacemaker, neurostimulator and other active implantable medical device (AIMD) patients. The safety and feasibility of MRI in patients with cardiac pacemakers is an issue of gaining significance. The effects of MRI on patients' pacemaker systems have only been analyzed retrospectively in some case reports. There are a number of papers that indicate that MRI on new generation pacemakers can be conducted up to 0.5 Tesla (T). MRI is one of medicine's most valuable diagnostic tools. MRI is, of course, extensively used for imaging, but is also used for interventional medicine (surgery). In addition, MRI is used in real time to guide ablation catheters, neurostimulator tips, deep brain probes and the like. An absolute contra-indication for pacemaker patients means that pacemaker and ICD wearers are excluded from MRI. This is particularly true of scans of the thorax and abdominal areas. Because of MRI's incredible value as a diagnostic tool for imaging organs and other body tissues, many physicians simply take the risk and go ahead and perform MRI on a pacemaker patient. The literature indicates a number of precautions that physicians should take in this case, including limiting the power of the MRI RF Pulsed field (Specific Absorption Rate—SAR level), programming the pacemaker to fixed or asynchronous pacing mode, and then careful reprogramming and evaluation of the pacemaker and patient after the procedure is complete. There have been reports of latent problems with cardiac pacemakers or other AIMDs after an MRI procedure sometimes occurring many days later. Moreover, there are a number of recent papers that indicate that the SAR level is not entirely predictive of the heating that would be found in implanted lead wires or devices. For example, for magnetic resonance imaging devices operating at the same magnetic field strength and also at the same SAR level, considerable variations have been found relative to heating of implanted lead wires. It is speculated that SAR level alone is not a good predictor of whether or not an implanted device or its associated lead wire system will overheat.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">There are three types of electromagnetic fields used in an MRI unit. The first type is the main static magnetic field designated B<sub>0 </sub>which is used to align protons in body tissue. The field strength varies from 0.5 to 3.0 Tesla in most of the currently available MRI units in clinical use. Some of the newer MRI system fields can go as high as 4 to 5 Tesla. At the recent International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM), which was held on 5 and 6 Nov. 2005, it was reported that certain research systems are going up as high as 11.7 Tesla and will be ready sometime in 2006. This is over 100,000 times the magnetic field strength of the earth. A static magnetic field can induce powerful mechanical forces and torque on any magnetic materials implanted within the patient. This would include certain components within the cardiac pacemaker itself and or lead wire systems. It is not likely (other than sudden system shut down) that the static MRI magnetic field can induce currents into the pacemaker lead wire system and hence into the pacemaker itself. It is a basic principle of physics that a magnetic field must either be time-varying as it cuts across the conductor, or the conductor itself must move within the magnetic field for currents to be induced.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">The second type of field produced by magnetic resonance imaging is the pulsed RF field which is generated by the body coil or head coil. This is used to change the energy state of the protons and illicit MRI signals from tissue. The RF field is homogeneous in the central region and has two main components: (1) the magnetic field is circularly polarized in the actual plane; and (2) the electric field is related to the magnetic field by Maxwell's equations. In general, the RF field is switched on and off during measurements and usually has a frequency of 21 MHz to 64 MHz to 128 MHz depending upon the static magnetic field strength. The frequency of the RF pulse varies with the field strength of the main static field where: RF PULSED FREQUENCY in MHz=(42.56) (STATIC FIELD STRENGTH IN TESLA).</p>
    <p num="p-0008">The third type of electromagnetic field is the time-varying magnetic gradient fields designated B<sub>1 </sub>which are used for spatial localization. These change their strength along different orientations and operating frequencies on the order of 1 kHz. The vectors of the magnetic field gradients in the X, Y and Z directions are produced by three sets of orthogonally positioned coils and are switched on only during the measurements. In some cases, the gradient field has been shown to elevate natural heart rhythms (heart beat). This is not completely understood, but it is a repeatable phenomenon. The gradient field is not considered by many researchers to create any other adverse effects.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">It is instructive to note how voltages and EMI are induced into an implanted lead wire system. At very low frequency (VLF), voltages are induced at the input to the cardiac pacemaker as currents circulate throughout the patient's body and create voltage drops. Because of the vector displacement between the pacemaker housing and, for example, the TIP electrode, voltage drop across the resistance of body tissues may be sensed due to Ohms Law and the circulating current of the RF signal. At higher frequencies, the implanted lead wire systems actually act as antennas where currents are induced along their length. These antennas are not very efficient due to the damping effects of body tissue; however, this can often be offset by extremely high power fields (such as MRI pulsed fields) and/or body resonances. At very high frequencies (such as cellular telephone frequencies), EMI signals are induced only into the first area of the lead wire system (for example, at the header block of a cardiac pacemaker). This has to do with the wavelength of the signals involved and where they couple efficiently into the system.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">Magnetic field coupling into an implanted lead wire system is based on loop areas. For example, in a cardiac pacemaker, there is a loop formed by the lead wire as it comes from the cardiac pacemaker housing to its distal TIP, for example, located in the right ventricle. The return path is through body fluid and tissue generally straight from the TIP electrode in the right ventricle back up to the pacemaker case or housing. This forms an enclosed area which can be measured from patient X-rays in square centimeters. The average loop area is 200 to 225 square centimeters. This is an average and is subject to great statistical variation. For example, in a large adult patient with an abdominal implant, the implanted loop area is much larger (greater than 450 square centimeters).</p>
    <p num="p-0011">Relating now to the specific case of MRI, the magnetic gradient fields would be induced through enclosed loop areas. However, the pulsed RF fields, which are generated by the body coil, would be primarily induced into the lead wire system by antenna action.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">There are a number of potential problems with MRI, including:
</p> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0020">(1) Closure of the pacemaker reed switch. A pacemaker reed switch, which can also be a Hall Effect device, is designed to detect a permanent magnet held close to the patient's chest. This magnet placement allows a physician or even the patient to put the implantable medical device into what is known as the “magnet mode response.” The “magnet mode response” varies from one manufacturer to another, however, in general, this puts the pacemaker into a fixed rate or asynchronous pacing mode. This is normally done for short times and is very useful for diagnostic and clinical purposes. However, in some cases, when a pacemaker is brought into the bore or close to the MRI scanner, the MRI static field can make the pacemaker's internal reed switch close, which puts the pacemaker into a fixed rate or asynchronous pacing mode. Worse yet, the reed switch may bounce or oscillate. Asynchronous pacing may compete with the patient's underlying cardiac rhythm. This is one reason why patients have generally been advised not to undergo MRI. Fixed rate or asynchronous pacing for most patients is not an issue. However, in patients with unstable conditions, such as myocardial ischemia, there is a substantial risk for ventricular fibrillation during asynchronous pacing. In most modern pacemakers the magnetic reed switch (or Hall Effect device) function is programmable. If the magnetic reed switch response is switched off, then synchronous pacing is still possible even in strong magnetic fields. The possibility to open and re-close the reed switch in the main magnetic field by the gradient field cannot be excluded. However, it is generally felt that the reed switch will remain closed due to the powerful static magnetic field. It is theoretically possible for certain reed switch orientations at the gradient field to be capable of repeatedly closing and re-opening the reed switch.</li> <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0021">(2) Reed switch damage. Direct damage to the reed switch is theoretically possible, but has not been reported in any of the known literature. In an article written by Roger Christoph Lüchinger of Zurich, he reports on testing in which reed switches were exposed to the static magnetic field of MRI equipment. After extended exposure to these static magnetic fields, the reed switches functioned normally at close to the same field strength as before the test.</li> <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0022">(3) Pacemaker displacement. Some parts of pacemakers, such as the batteries and reed switch, contain ferrous magnetic materials and are thus subject to mechanical forces during MRI. Pacemaker displacement may occur in response to magnetic force or magnetic torque. There are several recent reports on modern pacemakers and ICDs that force and torque are not of concern for MRI systems up to 3 Tesla.</li> <li id="ul0003-0004" num="0023">(4) Radio frequency field. At the frequencies of interest in MRI, RF energy can be absorbed and converted to heat. The power deposited by RF pulses during MRI is complex and is dependent upon the power (Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) Level) and duration of the RF pulse, the transmitted frequency, the number of RF pulses applied per unit time, and the type of configuration of the RF transmitter coil used. The amount of heating also depends upon the volume of tissue imaged, the electrical resistivity of tissue and the configuration of the anatomical region imaged. There are also a number of other variables that depend on the placement in the human body of the AIMD and its associated lead wire(s). For example, it will make a difference how much current is induced into a pacemaker lead wire system as to whether it is a left or right pectoral implant. In addition, the routing of the lead and the lead length are also very critical as to the amount of induced current and heating that would occur. Also, distal TIP design is very important as the distal TIP itself can act as its own antenna wherein eddy currents can create heating. The cause of heating in an MRI environment is two fold: (a) RF field coupling to the lead can occur which induces significant local heating; and (b) currents induced between the distal TIP and tissue during MRI RF pulse transmission sequences can cause local Ohms Law heating in tissue next to the distal TIP electrode of the implanted lead. The RF field of an MRI scanner can produce enough energy to induce lead wire currents sufficient to destroy some of the adjacent myocardial tissue. Tissue ablation has also been observed. The effects of this heating are not readily detectable by monitoring during the MRI. Indications that heating has occurred would include an increase in pacing threshold, venous ablation, Larynx or e ablation, myocardial perforation and lead penetration, or even arrhythmias caused by scar tissue. Such long term heating effects of MRI have not been well studied yet for all types of AIMD lead wire geometries. There can also be localized heating problems associated with various types of electrodes in addition to TIP electrodes. This includes RING electrodes or PAD electrodes. RING electrodes are commonly used with a wide variety of implanted devices including cardiac pacemakers, and neurostimulators, and the like. PAD electrodes are very common in neurostimulator applications. For example, spinal cord stimulators or deep brain stimulators can include a plurality of PAD electrodes to make contact with nerve tissue. A good example of this also occurs in a cochlear implant. In a typical cochlear implant there would be sixteen RING electrodes that the position places by pushing the electrode up into the cochlea. Several of these RING electrodes make contact with auditory nerves.</li> <li id="ul0003-0005" num="0024">(5) Alterations of pacing rate due to the applied radio frequency field. It has been observed that the RF field may induce undesirable fast pacing (QRS complex) rates. There are various mechanisms which have been proposed to explain rapid pacing: direct tissue stimulation, interference with pacemaker electronics or pacemaker reprogramming (or reset). In all of these cases, it is very desirable to raise the lead system impedance (at the MRI RF pulsed frequency) to make an EMI filter feedthrough capacitor more effective and thereby provide a higher degree of protection to AIMD electronics. This will make alterations in pacemaker pacing rate and/or pacemaker reprogramming much more unlikely.</li> <li id="ul0003-0006" num="0025">(6) Time-varying magnetic gradient fields. The contribution of the time-varying gradient to the total strength of the MRI magnetic field is negligible, however, pacemaker systems could be affected because these fields are rapidly applied and removed. The time rate of change of the magnetic field is directly related to how much electromagnetic force and hence current can be induced into a lead wire system. Lüchinger reports that even using today's gradient systems with a time-varying field up to 50 Tesla per second, the induced currents are likely to stay below the biological thresholds for cardiac fibrillation. A theoretical upper limit for the induced voltage by the time-varying magnetic gradient field is 20 volts. Such a voltage during more than 0.1 milliseconds could be enough energy to directly pace the heart.</li> <li id="ul0003-0007" num="0026">(7) Heating. Currents induced by time-varying magnetic gradient fields may lead to local heating. Researchers feel that the calculated heating effect of the gradient field is much less as compared to that caused by the RF field and therefore for the purposes herein may be neglected.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p num="p-0013">There are additional problems possible with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). ICDs use different and larger batteries which could cause higher magnetic forces. The programmable sensitivity in ICDs is normally much higher (more sensitive) than it is for pacemakers, therefore, ICDs may falsely detect a ventricular tacchyarrhythmia and inappropriately deliver therapy. In this case, therapy might include anti-tacchycardia pacing, cardio version or defibrillation (high voltage shock) therapies. MRI magnetic fields may prevent detection of a dangerous ventricular arrhythmia or fibrillation. There can also be heating problems of ICD leads which are expected to be comparable to those of pacemaker leads. Ablation of vascular walls is another concern. Fortunately, ICDs have a sort of built-in fail-safe mechanism. That is, during an MRI procedure, if they inadvertently sense the MRI fields as a dangerous ventricular arrhythmia, the ICD will attempt to charge up and deliver a high voltage shock. However, there is a transformer contained within the ICD that is necessary to function in order to charge up the high-energy storage capacitor contained within the ICD. In the presence of the main static field of the MRI the core of this transformer tends to saturate thereby preventing the high voltage capacitor from charging up. This makes it highly unlikely that an ICD patient undergoing an MRI would receive an inappropriate high voltage shock therapy. While ICDs cannot charge during MRI due to the saturation of their ferro-magnetic transformers, the battery will be effectively shorted and lose life. This is a highly undesirable condition.</p>
    <p num="p-0014">In summary, there are a number of studies that have shown that MRI patients with active implantable medical devices, such as cardiac pacemakers, can be at risk for potential hazardous effects. However, there are a number of reports in the literature that MRI can be safe for imaging of pacemaker patients when a number of precautions are taken (only when an MRI is thought to be an absolute diagnostic necessity). While these anecdotal reports are of interest, however, they are certainly not scientifically convincing that all MRI can be safe. As previously mentioned, just variations in the pacemaker lead wire length can significantly effect how much heat is generated. From the layman's point of view, this can be easily explained by observing the typical length of the antenna on a cellular telephone compared to the vertical rod antenna more common on older automobiles. The relatively short antenna on the cell phone is designed to efficiently couple with the very high frequency wavelengths (approximately 950 MHz) of cellular telephone signals. In a typical AM and FM radio in an automobile, these wavelength signals would not efficiently couple to the relatively short antenna of a cell phone. This is why the antenna on the automobile is relatively longer. An analogous situation exists with an AIMD patient in an MRI system. If one assumes, for example, a 3.0 Tesla MRI system, which would have an RF pulsed frequency of 128 MHz, there are certain implanted lead lengths that would couple efficiently as fractions of the 128 MHz wavelength. It is typical that a hospital will maintain an inventory of various leads and that the implanting physician will make a selection depending on the size of the patient, implant location and other factors. Accordingly, the implanted or effective lead wire length can vary considerably. There are certain implanted lead wire lengths that just do not couple efficiently with the MRI frequency and there are others that would couple very efficiently and thereby produce the worst case for heating.</p>
    <p num="p-0015">The effect of an MRI system on the function of pacemakers, ICDs and neurostimulators depends on various factors, including the strength of the static magnetic field, the pulse sequence (gradient and RF field used), the anatomic region being imaged, and many other factors. Further complicating this is the fact that each patient's condition and physiology is different and each manufacturer's pacemaker and ICD designs also are designed and behave differently. Most experts still conclude that MRI for the pacemaker patient should not be considered safe. Paradoxically, this also does not mean that the patient should not receive MRI. The physician must make an evaluation given the pacemaker patient's condition and weigh the potential risks of MRI against the benefits of this powerful diagnostic tool. As MRI technology progresses, including higher field gradient changes over time applied to thinner tissue slices at more rapid imagery, the situation will continue to evolve and become more complex. An example of this paradox is a pacemaker patient who is suspected to have a cancer of the lung. RF ablation treatment of such a tumor may require stereotactic imaging only made possible through real time fine focus MRI. With the patient's life literally at risk, the physician with patient informed consent may make the decision to perform MRI in spite of all of the previously described attendant risks to the pacemaker system.</p>
    <p num="p-0016">Insulin drug pump systems do not seem to be of a major current concern due to the fact that they have no significant antenna components (such as implanted lead wires). However, some implantable pumps work on magneto-peristaltic systems, and must be deactivated prior to MRI. There are newer (unreleased) systems that would be based on solenoid systems which will have similar problems.</p>
    <p num="p-0017">It is clear that MRI will continue to be used in patients with active implantable medical devices. Accordingly, there is a need for AIMD system and/or circuit protection devices which will improve the immunity of active implantable medical device systems to diagnostic procedures such as MRI.</p>
    <p num="p-0018">As one can see, many of the undesirable effects in an implanted lead wire system from MRI and other medical diagnostic procedures are related to undesirable induced currents in the lead wire system and/or its distal TIP (or RING). This can lead to overheating either in the lead wire or at the body tissue at the distal TIP. For a pacemaker application, these currents can also directly stimulate the heart into sometimes dangerous arrhythmias.</p>
    <p num="p-0019">Accordingly, there is a need for a novel resonant tank or band stop filter assembly which can be placed at various locations along the active implantable medical device lead wire system, which also prevents current from circulating at selected frequencies of the medical therapeutic device. Preferably, such novel tank filters would be designed to resonate at 64 MHz for use in an MRI system operating at 1.5 Tesla (or 128 MHz for a 3 Tesla system). The present invention fulfills these needs and provides other related advantages.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0020">The present invention comprises resonant tank circuits/band stop filters to be placed at one or more locations along the active implantable medical device (AIMD) lead wire system, including its distal Tip. These band stop filters prevent current from circulating at selected frequencies of the medical therapeutic device. For example, for an MRI system operating at 1.5 Tesla, the pulse RF frequency is 64 MHz. The novel band stop filters of the present invention can be designed to resonate at 64 MHz and thus create an open circuit in the implanted lead wire system at that selected frequency. For example, the band stop filter of the present invention, when placed at the distal TIP, will prevent currents from flowing through the distal TIP, prevent currents from flowing in the implanted lead wires and also prevent currents from flowing into body tissue. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that all of the embodiments described herein are equally applicable to a wide range of other active implantable medical devices, including deep brain stimulators, spinal cord stimulators, cochlear implants, ventricular assist devices, artificial hearts, drug pumps, and the like. The present invention fulfills all of the needs regarding reduction or elimination of undesirable currents and associated heating in implanted lead wire systems.</p>
    <p num="p-0021">Electrically engineering a capacitor in parallel with an inductor is known as a tank filter. It is also well known that when the tank filter is at its resonant frequency, it will present a very high impedance. This is a basic principle of all radio receivers. In fact, multiple tank filters are often used to improve the selectivity of a radio receiver. One can adjust the resonant frequency of the tank circuit by either adjusting the capacitor value or the inductor value or both. Since medical diagnostic equipment which is capable of producing very large fields operates at discrete frequencies, this is an ideal situation for a specific tank or band stop filter. Band stop filters are more efficient for eliminating one single frequency than broadband filters. Because the band stop filter is targeted at this one frequency or range of frequencies, it can be much smaller and volumetrically efficient suitable for incorporation into an implantable medical device. In addition, the way MRI RF pulse fields couple with lead wire systems, various loops and associated loop currents result along various sections of the implanted lead wire. For example, at the distal TIP of a cardiac pacemaker, direct electromagnetic forces (EMF) can be produced which result in current loops through the distal TIP and into the associated myocardial tissue. This current system is largely decoupled from the currents that are induced near the active implantable medical device, for example, near the cardiac pacemaker. There the MRI may set up a separate loop with its associated currents. Accordingly, one or more band stop filters may be required to completely control all of the various induced EMI and associated currents in a lead wire system.</p>
    <p num="p-0022">The present invention which resides in band stop filters is also designed to work in concert with the EMI filter which is typically used at the point of lead wire ingress and egress of the active implantable medical device. For example, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,333,095, entitled FEEDTHROUGH FILTER CAPACITOR ASSEMBLY FOR HUMAN IMPLANT; U.S. Pat. No. 6,999,818, entitled INDUCTOR CAPACITOR EMI FILTER FOR HUMAN IMPLANT APPLICATIONS; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/097,999 filed Mar. 31, 2005, entitled APPARATUS AND PROCESS FOR REDUCING THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF ACTIVE IMPLANTABLE MEDICAL DEVICES TO MEDICAL PROCEDURES SUCH AS MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/163,915 filed Nov. 3, 2005, entitled PROCESS FOR TUNING AN EMI FILTER TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF HEAT GENERATED IN IMPLANTED LEAD WIRES DURING MEDICAL PROCEDURES SUCH AS MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING; the contents of all being incorporated herein by reference. All of these patent documents describe novel inductor capacitor combinations for low pass EMI filter circuits. It is of particular interest that by increasing the number of circuit elements, one can reduce the overall capacitance value which is at the input to the implantable medical device. It is important to reduce the capacitance value to raise the input impedance of the active implantable medical device such that this also reduces the amount of current that would flow in lead wire systems associated with medical procedures such as MRI. Accordingly, it is a feature of the present invention that the novel band stop filters are designed to be used in concert with the structures described in the above mentioned three patent applications.</p>
    <p num="p-0023">In one embodiment, the invention provides a medical therapeutic device comprising an active implantable medical device (AIMD), an implantable lead wire extending from the AIMD to a distal TIP thereof, and a band stop filter associated with the implantable lead wire for attenuating current flow through the lead wire at a selected frequency.</p>
    <p num="p-0024">The AIMD may comprise cochlear implants, piezoelectric sound bridge transducers, neurostimulators, brain stimulators, cardiac pacemakers, ventricular assist devices, artificial hearts, drug pumps, bone growth stimulators, bone fusion stimulators, urinary incontinence devices, pain relief spinal cord stimulators, anti-tremor stimulators, gastric stimulators, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, pH probes, congestive heart failure devices, neuromodulators, cardiovascular stents, orthopedic implants, and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0025">The band stop filter itself comprises a capacitor (and its resistance or an added resistance) in parallel with an inductor (and its parasitic resistance), said parallel capacitor and inductor combination being placed in series with the medical device implantable lead wire(s) wherein the values of capacitance and inductance have been selected such that the band stop filter is resonant at a selected frequency (such as the MRI pulsed frequency).</p>
    <p num="p-0026">In the preferred embodiment, the overall Q factor of the band stop filter is selected to balance impedance at the selected frequency versus frequency band width characteristics. More specifically, the Q of the inductor is relatively maximized and the Q of the capacitor is relatively minimized to reduce the overall Q of the band stop filter. The Q of the inductor is relatively maximized by minimizing the parasitic resistive loss in the inductor, and the Q of the capacitor is relatively minimized by raising its equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the capacitor (or by adding resistance or a resistive element in series with the capacitor element of the bank stop tank filter). This reduces the overall Q of the band stop filter in order to broaden its 3 dB points and thereby attenuate current flow through the lead wire along a range of selected frequencies. In AIMD or external medical device applications, the range of selected frequencies includes a plurality of MRI pulsed frequencies.</p>
    <p num="p-0027">The equivalent series resistance of the capacitor is raised by any of the following: reducing thickness of electrode plates in the capacitor; using higher resistivity capacitor electrode materials, providing apertures, gaps, slits or spokes in the electrode plates of the capacitor; providing separate discrete resistors in series with the capacitor; utilizing resistive electrical attachment materials to the capacitor; or utilizing capacitor dielectric materials that have high dielectric loss tangents at the selected frequency. Methods of using higher resistivity capacitor electrode materials include, for example, using platinum instead of silver electrodes. Platinum has a higher volume resistivity as compared to pure silver. Another way of reducing capacitor electrode plate resistivity is to add ceramic powders to the electrode ink before it is silk screened down and fired. After firing, this has the effect of separating the conductive electrode portions by insulative dielectric areas which increases the overall resistivity of the electrode plate.</p>
    <p num="p-0028">As defined herein, raising the capacitor ESR includes any or all of the above described methods of adding resistance in series with the capacitive element of the band stop filter. It should be noted that deliberately raising the capacitor ESR runs counter to conventional/prior art capacitor technologies. In fact, capacitor manufacturers generally strive to build capacitors with as low an ESR as possible. This is to minimize energy loss, etc. It is a feature of the present invention that capacitor Q is raised in a controlled manner in the tank filter circuit in order to adjust its Q and adjust the band stop frequency width in the range of MRI pulsed frequencies.</p>
    <p num="p-0029">Preferably, the band stop filter is disposed adjacent to the distal tip of the lead wire and is integrated into a TIP electrode. It may also be integrated into one or more RING electrodes.</p>
    <p num="p-0030">The present invention also provides a novel process for attenuating current flow through an implantable lead wire for an active implantable medical device at a selected frequency, comprising the steps of: selecting a capacitor which is resonant at the selected frequency; selecting an inductor which is resonant at the selected frequency; using the capacitor and the inductor to form a tank filter circuit; and placing the tank filter circuit in series with the lead wire.</p>
    <p num="p-0031">The overall Q of the tank filter circuit may be reduced by increasing the Q of the inductor and reducing the Q of the capacitor. In this regard, minimizing resistive loss in the inductor maximizes the Q of the inductor, and raising the equivalent series resistance of the capacitor minimizes the Q of the capacitor.</p>
    <p num="p-0032">The net effect is to reduce the overall Q of the tank filter circuit which widens the band stop width to attenuate current flow through the lead wire along a range of selected frequencies. As discussed herein, the range of selected frequencies may include a plurality of MRI pulse frequencies.</p>

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p num="p-0062"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates of various types of active implantable medical devices <b>100</b> that are currently in use. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a wire formed diagram of a generic human body showing a number of implanted medical devices. <b>100</b>A is a family of implantable hearing devices which can include the group of cochlear implants, piezoelectric sound bridge transducers and the like. <b>100</b>B includes an entire variety of neurostimulators and brain stimulators. Neurostimulators are used to stimulate the Vagus nerve, for example, to treat epilepsy, obesity and depression. Brain stimulators are similar to a pacemaker-like device and include electrodes implanted deep into the brain for sensing the onset of the seizure and also providing electrical stimulation to brain tissue to prevent the seizure from actually happening. <b>100</b>C shows a cardiac pacemaker which is well-known in the art. <b>100</b>D includes the family of left ventricular assist devices (LVAD's), and artificial hearts, including the recently introduced artificial heart known as the Abiocor. <b>100</b>E includes an entire family of drug pumps which can be used for dispensing of insulin, chemotherapy drugs, pain medications and the like. Insulin pumps are evolving from passive devices to ones that have sensors and closed loop systems. That is, real time monitoring of blood sugar levels will occur. These devices tend to be more sensitive to EMI than passive pumps that have no sense circuitry or externally implanted lead wires. <b>100</b>F includes a variety of implantable bone growth stimulators for rapid healing of fractures. <b>100</b>G includes urinary incontinence devices. <b>100</b>H includes the family of pain relief spinal cord stimulators and anti-tremor stimulators. <b>100</b>H also includes an entire family of other types of neurostimulators used to block pain. <b>100</b>I includes a family of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) devices and also includes the family of congestive heart failure devices (CHF). This is also known in the art as cardio resynchronization therapy devices, otherwise knows as CRT devices.</p>
    <p num="p-0063">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a prior art active implantable medical device (AIMD) <b>100</b> is illustrated. In general, the AIMD <b>100</b> could, for example, be a cardiac pacemaker <b>100</b>C which is enclosed by a titanium housing <b>102</b> as indicated. The titanium housing is hermetically sealed, however there is a point where lead wires <b>104</b> must ingress and egress the hermetic seal. This is accomplished by providing a hermetic terminal assembly <b>106</b>. Hermetic terminal assemblies are well known and generally consist of a ferrule <b>108</b> which is laser welded to the titanium housing <b>102</b> of the AIMD <b>100</b>. The hermetic terminal assembly <b>106</b> with its associated EMI filter is better shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Referring once again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, four lead wires are shown consisting of lead wire pair <b>104</b> <i>a </i>and <b>104</b> <i>b </i>and lead wire pair <b>104</b> <i>c </i>and <b>104</b> <i>d</i>. This is typical of what's known as a dual chamber bipolar cardiac pacemaker.</p>
    <p num="p-0064">The ISI connectors <b>110</b> that are designed to plug into the header block <b>112</b> are low voltage (pacemaker) connectors covered by an ANSI/AAMI standard IS-1. Higher voltage devices, such as implantable cardioverter defibrillators, are covered by a standard known as the ANSI/AAMI DF-1. There is a new standard under development which will integrate both high voltage and low voltage connectors into a new miniature connector series known as the IS-4 series. These connectors are typically routed in a pacemaker application down into the right ventricle and right atrium of the heart <b>114</b>. There are also new generation devices that have been introduced to the market that couple lead wires to the outside of the left ventricle. These are known as biventricular devices and are very effective in cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) and treating congestive heart failure (CHF).</p>
    <p num="p-0065">Referring once again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, one can see, for example, the bipolar lead wires <b>104</b> <i>a </i>and <b>104</b> <i>b </i>that could be routed, for example, to the distal TIP and RING into the right ventricle. The bipolar lead wires <b>104</b> <i>c </i>and <b>104</b> <i>d </i>could be routed to a distal TIP and RING in the right atrium. There is also an RF telemetry pin antenna <b>116</b> which is not connected to the IS-1 or DS-1 connector block. This acts as a short stub antenna for picking up telemetry signals that are transmitted from the outside of the device <b>100</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0066">It should also be obvious to those skilled in the art that all of the descriptions herein are equally applicable to other types of AIMDs. These include implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), neurostimulators, including deep brain stimulators, spinal cord stimulators, cochlear implants, incontinence stimulators and the like, and drug pumps. The present invention is also applicable to a wide variety of minimally invasive AIMDs. For example, in certain hospital cath lab procedures, one can insert an AIMD for temporary use such as an ICD. Ventricular assist devices also can fall into this type of category. This list is not meant to be limiting, but is only example of the applications of the novel technology currently described herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0067"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an enlarged, fragmented cross-sectional view taken generally along line <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Here one can see in cross-section the RF telemetry pin <b>116</b> and the bipolar lead wires <b>104</b> <i>a </i>and <b>104</b> <i>c </i>which would be routed to the cardiac chambers by connecting these lead wires to the internal connectors <b>118</b> of the IS-1 header block <b>112</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). These connectors are designed to receive the plug <b>110</b> which allows the physicians to thread lead wires through the venous system down into the appropriate chambers of the heart <b>114</b>. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that tunneling of deep brain electrodes or neurostimulators are equivalent.</p>
    <p num="p-0068">Referring back to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, one can see a prior art feedthrough capacitor <b>120</b> which has been bonded to the hermetic terminal assembly <b>106</b>. These feedthrough capacitors are well known in the art and are described and illustrated in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,333,095, 5,751,539, 5,978,204, 5,905,627, 5,959,829, 5,973,906, 5,978,204, 6,008,980, 6,159,560, 6,275,369, 6,424,234, 6,456,481, 6,473,291, 6,529,103, 6,566,978, 6,567,259, 6,643,903, 6,675,779, 6,765,780 and 6,882,248. In this case, a rectangular quadpolar feedthrough capacitor <b>120</b> is illustrated which has an external metallized termination surface <b>122</b>. It includes embedded electrode plate sets <b>124</b> and <b>126</b>. Electrode plate set <b>124</b> is known as the ground electrode plate set and is terminated at the outside of the capacitor <b>120</b> at the termination surface <b>122</b>. These ground electrode plates <b>124</b> are electrically and mechanically connected to the ferrule <b>108</b> of the hermetic terminal assembly <b>106</b> using a thermosetting conductive polyimide or equivalent material <b>128</b> (equivalent materials will include solders, brazes, conductive epoxies and the like). In turn, the hermetic seal terminal assembly <b>106</b> is designed to have its titanium ferrule <b>108</b> laser welded <b>130</b> to the overall housing <b>102</b> of the AIMD <b>100</b>. This forms a continuous hermetic seal thereby preventing body fluids from penetrating into and causing damage to the electronics of the AIMD.</p>
    <p num="p-0069">It is also essential that the lead wires <b>104</b> and insulator <b>136</b> be hermetically sealed, such as by the gold brazes or glass seals <b>132</b> and <b>134</b>. The gold braze <b>132</b> wets from the titanium ferrule <b>108</b> to the alumina ceramic insulator <b>136</b>. In turn, the ceramic alumina insulator <b>136</b> is also gold brazed at <b>134</b> to each of the lead wires <b>104</b>. The RF telemetry pin <b>116</b> is also gold brazed at <b>138</b> to the alumina ceramic insulator <b>136</b>. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that there are a variety of other ways of making such a hermetic terminal. This would include glass sealing the leads into the ferrule directly without the need for the gold brazes.</p>
    <p num="p-0070">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the RF telemetry pin <b>116</b> has not been included in the area of the feedthrough capacitor <b>120</b>. The reason for this is the feedthrough capacitor <b>120</b> is a very broadband single element EMI filter which would eliminate the desirable telemetry frequency.</p>
    <p num="p-0071"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a bottom view taken generally along line <b>4</b>-<b>4</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. One can see the gold braze <b>132</b> which completely seals the hermetic terminal insulator <b>136</b> into the overall titanium ferrule <b>108</b>. One can also see the overlap of the capacitor attachment materials, shown as a thermosetting conductive adhesive <b>128</b>, which makes contact to the gold braze <b>132</b> that forms the hermetic terminal <b>106</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0072"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an isometric view of the feedthrough capacitor <b>120</b>. As one can see, the termination surface <b>122</b> connects to the capacitor's internal ground plate set <b>124</b>. This is best seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> where ground plate set <b>124</b>, which is typically silk-screened onto ceramic layers, is brought out and exposed to the termination surface <b>122</b>. The capacitor's four (quadpolar) active electrode plate sets <b>126</b> are illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> one can see that the lead wires <b>104</b> are in non-electrical communication with the ground electrode plate set <b>124</b>. However, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> one can see that each one of the lead wires <b>104</b> is in electrical contact with its corresponding active electrode plate set <b>126</b>. The amount of capacitance is determined by the overlap of the active electrode plate area <b>126</b> over the ground electrode plate area. One can increase the amount of capacitance by increasing the area of the active electrode plate set <b>126</b>. One can also increase the capacitance by adding additional layers. In this particular application, we are only showing six electrode layers: three ground plates <b>124</b> and three active electrode plate sets <b>126</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). However, 10, 60 or even more than 100 such sets can be placed in parallel thereby greatly increasing the capacitance value. The capacitance value is also related to the dielectric thickness or spacing between the ground electrode set <b>124</b> and the active electrode set <b>126</b>. Reducing the dielectric thickness increases the capacitance significantly while at the same time reducing its voltage rating. This gives the designer many degrees of freedom in selecting the capacitance value.</p>

    <p num="p-0074"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a general diagram of a unipolar active implantable medical device system <b>100</b>. The housing <b>102</b> of the active implantable medical device <b>100</b> is typically titanium, ceramic, stainless steel or the like. Inside of the device housing are the AIMD electronic circuits. Usually AIMDs include a battery, but that is not always the case. For example, for a Bion, it can receive its energy from an external pulsing magnetic field. A lead wire <b>104</b> is routed from the AIMD <b>100</b> to a point <b>140</b> where it is embedded in or affixed to body tissue. In the case of a spinal cord stimulator <b>100</b>H, the distal TIP <b>140</b> could be in the spinal cord. In the case of a deep brain stimulator <b>100</b>B, the distal electrode <b>140</b> would be placed deep into the brain, etc. In the case of a cardiac pacemaker <b>100</b>C, the distal electrode <b>140</b> would typically be placed in the cardiac right ventricle.</p>
    <p num="p-0075"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is very similar to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> except that it is a bipolar system. In this case, the electric circuit return path is between the two distal electrodes <b>140</b> and <b>140</b>′. In the case of a cardiac pacemaker <b>100</b>C, this would be known as a bipolar lead wire system with one of the electrodes known as the distal TIP <b>142</b> and the other electrode which would float in the blood pool known as the RING <b>144</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). In contrast, the electrical return path in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is between the distal electrode <b>140</b> through body tissue to the conductive housing <b>102</b> of the implantable medical device <b>100</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0076"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a bipolar lead wire system with a distal TIP <b>142</b> and RING <b>144</b> typically as used in a cardiac pacemaker <b>100</b>C. In all of these applications, the patient could be exposed to the fields of an MRI scanner or other powerful emitter used during a medical diagnostic procedure. Currents that are directly induced in the lead wire system <b>104</b> can cause heating by I<sup>2</sup>R losses in the lead wire system or by heating caused by current flowing in body tissue. If these currents become excessive, the associated heating can cause damage or even destructive ablation to body tissue.</p>
    <p num="p-0077">The distal TIP <b>142</b> is designed to be implanted into or affixed to the actual myocardial tissue of the heart. The RING <b>144</b> is designed to float in the blood pool. Because the blood is flowing and is thermally conductive, the RING <b>144</b> structure is substantially cooled. In theory, however, if the lead curves, the RING <b>144</b> could also touch and become encapsulated by body tissue. The distal TIP <b>142</b>, on the other hand, is always thermally insulated by surrounding body tissue and can readily heat up due to the RF pulse currents of an MRI field.</p>
    <p num="p-0078"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a schematic diagram showing a parallel combination of an inductor L and a capacitor C to be placed in the implantable lead wire systems <b>104</b> previously described. This combination forms a parallel tank circuit or band stop filter <b>146</b> which will resonate at a particular frequency (f<sub>r</sub>).</p>
    <p num="p-0079"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> gives the frequency of resonance equation f<sub>r </sub>for the parallel tank circuit <b>146</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>: where f<sub>r </sub>is the frequency of resonance in hertz, L is the inductance in henries and C is the capacitance in farads. MRI systems vary in static field strength from 0.5 Tesla all the way up to 3 Tesla with newer research machines going much higher. This is the force of the main static magnetic field. The frequency of the pulsed RF field associated with MRI is found by multiplying the static field in Teslas times 42.45. Accordingly, a 3 Tesla MRI system has a pulsed RF field of approximately 128 MHz.</p>
    <p num="p-0080">Referring once again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, one can see that if the values of the inductor and the capacitor are selected properly, one could obtain a parallel tank resonant frequency of 128 MHz. For a 1.5 Tesla MRI system, the RF pulse frequency is 64 MHz. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, one can see the calculations assuming that the inductor value L is equal to one nanohenry. The one nanohenry comes from the fact that given the small geometries involved inside of the human body, a very large inductor will not be possible. This is in addition to the fact that the use of ferrite materials or iron cores for such an inductor are not practical for two reasons: 1) the static magnetic field from the MRI scanner would align the magnetic dipoles (saturate) in such a ferrite and therefore make the inductor ineffective; and 2) the presence of ferrite materials will cause severe MRI image artifacts. What this means is that if one were imaging the right ventricle of the heart, for example, a fairly large area of the image would be blacked out or image distorted due to the presence of these ferrite materials and the way it interacts with the MRI field. It is also important that the inductance value not vary while in the presence of the main static field.</p>
    <p num="p-0081">The relationship between the parallel inductor L and capacitor C is also very important. One could use, for example, a very large value of inductance which would result in a very small value of capacitance to be resonant, for example, at the MRI frequency of 64 MHz. However, using a very high value of inductor results in a high number of turns of very small wire. Using a high number of turns of very small diameter wire is contraindicated for two reasons. The first reason is that the long length of relatively small diameter wire results in a very high DC resistance for the inductor. This resistance is very undesirable because low frequency pacing or neurostimulator pulses would lose energy passing through the relatively high series resistance. This is also undesirable where the AIMD is sensing biologic signals. For example, in the case of a pacemaker or deep brain stimulator, continuous sensing of low frequency biological signals is required. Too much series resistance in a lead wire system will attenuate such signals thereby making the AIMD less efficient. Accordingly, it is a preferred feature of the present invention that a relatively large value of capacitance will be used in parallel with a relatively small value of inductance, for example, employing highly volumetrically efficient ceramic dielectric capacitors that can create a great deal of capacitance in a very small space.</p>
    <p num="p-0082">It should be also noted that below resonance, particularly at very low frequencies, the current in the parallel L-C band width stop filter passes through the inductor element. Accordingly, it is important that the parasitic resistance of the inductor element be quite low. Conversely, at very low frequencies, no current passes through the capacitor element. At high frequencies, the reactance of the capacitor element drops to a very low value. However, as there is no case where it is actually desirable to have high frequencies pass through the tank filter, the parasitic resistive loss of the capacitor is not particularly important. This is also known as the capacitor's equivalent series resistance (ESR). A component of capacitor ESR is the dissipation factor of the capacitor (a low frequency phenomena). Off of resonance, it is not particularly important how high the capacitor's dissipation factor or overall ESR is when used as a component of a parallel tank circuit <b>146</b> as described herein. Accordingly, an air wound inductor is the ideal choice because it is not affected by MRI signals or fields. Because of the space limitations, however, the inductor will not be very volumetrically efficient. For this reason, it is preferable to keep the inductance value relatively low (in the order of 1 to 100 nanohenries).</p>
    <p num="p-0083">Referring once again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, one can see the calculations for capacitance by algebraically solving the resonant frequency f<sub>r </sub>equation shown for C. Assuming an inductance value of one nanohenry, one can see that 6 nano-farads of capacitance would be required. Six nano-farads of capacitance is a relatively high value of capacitance. However, ceramic dielectrics that provide a very high dielectric constant are well known in the art and are very volumetrically efficient. They can also be made of biocompatible materials making them an ideal choice for use in the present invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0084"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a graph showing impedance versus frequency for the parallel tank, band stop filter circuit <b>146</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. As one can see, using ideal circuit components, the impedance measured between points A and B for the parallel tank circuit <b>146</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is very low (zero) until one approaches the resonant frequency f<sub>r</sub>. At the frequency of resonance, these ideal components combine together to look like a very high or, ideally, an infinite impedance. The reason for this comes from the denominator of the equation Z<sub>ab </sub>for the impedance for the inductor in parallel with the capacitor shown as <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. When the inductive reactance is equal to the capacitive reactance, the two imaginary vectors cancel each other and go to zero. Referring to the equations in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, one can see in the impedance equation for Z<sub>ab</sub>, that a zero will appear in the denominator when X<sub>L</sub>=X<sub>C</sub>. This has the effect of making the impedance approach infinity as the denominator approaches zero. As a practical matter, one does not really achieve an infinite impedance. However, tests have shown that several hundred ohms can be realized which offers a great deal of attenuation and protection to RF pulsed currents from MRI. What this means is that at one particular unique frequency, the impedance between points A and B in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> will appear very high (analogous to opening a switch). Accordingly, it would be possible, for example, in the case of a cardiac pacemaker, to design the cardiac pacemaker for compatibility with one single popular MRI system. For example, in the AIMD patient literature and physician manual it could be noted that the pacemaker lead wire system has been designed to be compatible with 3 Tesla MRI systems. Accordingly, with this particular device, a distal TIP band stop filter <b>146</b> would be incorporated where the L and the C values have been carefully selected to be resonant at 128 MHz, presenting a high or almost infinite impedance at the MRI pulse frequency.</p>
    <p num="p-0085"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a schematic drawing of the parallel tank circuit <b>146</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, except in this case the inductor L and the capacitor C are not ideal. That is, the capacitor C has its own internal resistance R<sub>C</sub>, which is otherwise known in the industry as dissipation factor or equivalent series resistance (ESR). The inductor L also has a resistance R<sub>L</sub>. For those that are experienced in passive components, one would realize that the inductor L would also have some parallel capacitance. This parasitic capacitance comes from the capacitance associated with adjacent turns. However, the inductance value contemplated is so low that one can assume that at MRI pulse frequencies, the inductor's parallel capacitance is negligible. One could also state that the capacitor C also has some internal inductance which would appear in series. However, the novel capacitors described below are very small or coaxial and have negligible series inductance. Accordingly, the circuit shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a very good approximation model for the novel parallel tank circuits <b>146</b> as described herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0086">This is best understood by looking at the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> circuit <b>146</b> at the frequency extremes. At very low frequency, the inductor reactance equation is X<sub>L</sub>=2πfL (reference <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). When the frequency f is close to zero (DC), this means that the inductor looks like a short circuit. It is generally the case that biologic signals are low frequency, typically between 10 Hz and 1000 Hz. For example, in a cardiac pacemaker <b>100</b>C, all of the frequencies of interest appear between 10 Hz and 1000 Hz. At these low frequencies, the inductive reactance X<sub>L </sub>will be very close to zero ohms. Over this range, on the other hand, the capacitive reactance X<sub>C </sub>which has the equation X<sub>C</sub>=1/(2πfc) will look like an infinite or open circuit (reference <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). As such, at low frequencies, the impedance between points A and B in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> will equal to R<sub>L</sub>. Accordingly, the resistance of the inductor (R<sub>L</sub>) should be kept as small as possible to minimize attenuation of biologic signals or attenuation of stimulation pulses to body tissues. This will allow biologic signals to pass through the band stop filter <b>146</b> freely. It also indicates that the amount of capacitive loss R<sub>C </sub>is not particularly important. As a matter of fact, it would be desirable if that loss were fairly high so as to not freely pass very high frequency signals (such as undesirable EMI from cellular phones). It is also desirable to have the Q of the circuit shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> relatively low so that the band stop frequency bandwidth can be a little wider. In other words, in a preferred embodiment, it would be possible to have a band stop wide enough to block both 64 MHz and 128 MHz frequencies thereby making the medical device compatible for use in both 1.5 Tesla and 3 Tesla MRI systems.</p>
    <p num="p-0087"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a drawing of the unipolar AIMD lead wire system, previously shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, with the band stop filter <b>146</b> of the present invention added near the distal electrode <b>140</b>. As previously described, the presence of the tank circuit <b>146</b> will present a very high impedance at one or more specific MRI RF pulse frequencies. This will prevent currents from circulating through the distal electrode <b>140</b> into body tissue at this selected frequency(s). This will provide a very high degree of important protection to the patient so that overheating does not cause tissue damage.</p>
    <p num="p-0088"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a representation of the novel band stop tank filter <b>146</b> using switches that open and close at various frequencies to illustrate its function. Inductor L has been replaced with a switch S<sub>L</sub>. When the impedance of the inductor is quite low, the switch S<sub>L </sub>will be closed. When the impedance or inductive reactance of the inductor is high, the switch S<sub>L </sub>will be shown open. There is a corresponding analogy for the capacitor element C. When the capacitive reactance looks like a very low impedance, the capacitor switch S<sub>C </sub>will be shown closed. When the capacitive reactance is shown as a very high impedance, the switch S<sub>C </sub>will be shown open. This analogy is best understood by referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19</figref>, <b>20</b> and <b>21</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0089"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is the low frequency model of the band stop filter <b>146</b>. At low frequencies, capacitors tend to look like open circuits and inductors tend to look like short circuits. Accordingly, switch S<sub>L </sub>is closed and switch S<sub>C </sub>is open. This is an indication that at frequencies below the resonant frequency of the band stop filter <b>146</b> that currents will flow only through the inductor element and its corresponding resistance R<sub>L</sub>. This is an important consideration for the present invention that low frequency biological signals not be attenuated. For example, in a cardiac pacemaker, frequencies of interest generally fall between 10 Hz and 1000 Hz. Pacemaker pacing pulses fall within this general frequency range. In addition, the implantable medical device is also sensing biological frequencies in the same frequency range. Accordingly, such signals must be able to flow readily through the band stop filter's inductor element. A great deal of attention should be paid to the inductor design so that it has a very high quality factor (Q) and a very low value of parasitic series resistance R<sub>L</sub>.</p>
    <p num="p-0090"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a model of the novel band stop filter <b>146</b> at its resonant frequency. By definition, when a parallel tank circuit is at resonance, it presents a very high impedance to the overall circuit. Accordingly, both switches S<sub>L </sub>and S<sub>C </sub>are shown open. For example, this is how the band stop filter <b>146</b> prevents the flow of MRI currents through pacemaker lead wires and/or into body tissue at a selected MRI RF pulsed frequency.</p>
    <p num="p-0091"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a model of the band stop filter <b>146</b> at high frequency. At high frequencies, inductors tend to look like open circuits. Accordingly, switch S<sub>L </sub>is shown open. At high frequencies, ideal capacitors tend to look like short circuits, hence switch S<sub>C </sub>is closed. It should be noted that real capacitors are not ideal and tend to degrade in performance at high frequency. This is due to the capacitor's equivalent series inductance and equivalent series resistance. Fortunately, for the present invention, it is not important how lossy (resistive) the capacitor element C gets at high frequency. This will only serve to attenuate unwanted electromagnetic interference from flowing in the lead wire system. Accordingly, in terms of biological signals, the equivalent series resistance R<sub>C </sub>and resulting quality factor of the capacitor element C is not nearly as important as the quality factor of the inductor element L. The equation for inductive reactance (X<sub>L</sub>) is given in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. The capacitor reactance equation (X<sub>C</sub>) is also given in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. As one can see, when one inserts zero or infinity for the frequency, one derives the fact that at very low frequencies inductors tend to look like short circuits and capacitors tend to look like open circuits. By inserting a very high frequency into the same equations, one can see that at very high frequency ideal inductors look like an infinite or open impedance and ideal capacitors look like a very low or short circuit impedance.</p>
    <p num="p-0092"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is a decision tree block diagram that better illustrates the design process herein. Block <b>148</b> is an initial decision step the designer must make. For illustrative purposes, we will start with a value of capacitance that is convenient. This value of capacitance is generally going to relate to the amount of space available in the AIMD lead wire system and other factors. These values for practical purposes generally range in capacitance value from a few tens of picofarads up to about 10,000 picofarads. This puts practical boundaries on the amount of capacitance that can be effectively packaged within the scope of the present invention. However, that is not intended to limit the general principles of the present invention, but just describe a preferred embodiment. Accordingly, in the preferred embodiment, one will select capacitance values generally ranging from 100 picofarads up to about 4000 picofarads and then solve for a corresponding inductance value required to be self-resonant at the selected telemetry frequency. Referring back to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, one makes the decision whether the design was C first or L first. If one makes a decision to assume a capacitance value C first then one is directed to the left to block <b>150</b>. In block <b>150</b>, one does an assessment of the overall packaging requirements of a distal TIP <b>142</b> band stop filter <b>146</b> and then assumes a realizable capacitance value. So, in decision block <b>150</b>, we assume a capacitor value. We then solve the resonant tank equation f<sub>r </sub>from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> at block <b>152</b> for the required value of inductance (L). We then look at a number of inductor designs to see if the inductance value is realizable within the space, parasitic resistance R<sub>C</sub>, and other constraints of the design. If the inductance value is realizable, then we go on to block <b>154</b> and finalize the design. If the inductance value is not realizable within the physical and practical constraints, then we need to go back to block <b>150</b> and assume a new value of capacitance. One may go around this loop a number of times until one finally comes up with a compatible capacitor and an inductor design. In some cases, one will not be able to achieve a final design using this alone. In other words, one may have to use a custom capacitor value or design in order to achieve a result that meets all of the design criteria. That is, a capacitor design with high enough internal losses R<sub>C </sub>and an inductor design with low internal loss R<sub>L </sub>such that the band stop filter <b>146</b> has the required quality factor (Q), that it be small enough in size, that it have sufficient current and high voltage handling capabilities and the like. In other words, one has to consider all of the design criteria in going through this decision tree.</p>
    <p num="p-0093">In the case where one has gone through the left hand decision tree consisting of blocks <b>150</b>, <b>152</b> and <b>154</b> a number of times and keeps coming up with a “no,” then one has to assume a realizable value of inductance and go to the right hand decision tree starting at block <b>156</b>. One then assumes a realizable value of inductance (L) with a low enough series resistance for the inductor R<sub>L </sub>such that it will work and fit into the design space and guidelines. After one assumes that value of inductance, one then goes to decision block <b>158</b> and solves the equation C in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> for the required amount of capacitance. After one finds the desired amount of capacitance C, one then determines whether that custom value of capacitance will fit into the design parameters. If the capacitance value that is determined in step <b>160</b> is realizable, then one goes on and finalizes the design. However, if it is not realizable, then one can go back up to step <b>156</b>, assume a different value of L and go through the decision tree again. This is done over and over until one finds combinations of L and C that are practical for the overall design.</p>
    <p num="p-0094">For purposes of the present invention, it is possible to use series discrete inductors or parallel discrete capacitors to achieve the same overall result. For example, in the case of the inductor element L, it would be possible to use two, three or even more (n) individual inductor elements in series. The same is true for the capacitor element that appears in the parallel tank filter <b>146</b>. By adding or subtracting capacitors in parallel, we are also able to adjust the total capacitance that ends up resonating in parallel with the inductance.</p>
    <p num="p-0095">It is also possible to use a single inductive component that has significant parasitic capacitance between its adjacent turns. A careful designer using multiple turns could create enough parasitic capacitance such that the coil becomes self-resonant at a predetermined frequency. In this case, the predetermined frequency would be the MRI pulsed frequency.</p>
    <p num="p-0096">Efficiency of the overall tank circuit <b>146</b> is also measured in terms of a quality factor, Q, although this factor is defined differently than the one previously mentioned for discrete capacitors and inductors. The circuit Q is typically expressed using the following equation:</p>
    <p num="p-0097">
      <maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"> <math overflow="scroll"> <mrow> <mi>Q</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mfrac> <msub> <mi>f</mi> <mi>r</mi> </msub> <mrow> <mi>Δ</mi> <mo>⁢</mo> <mstyle> <mspace width="0.3em" height="0.3ex"> </mspace> </mstyle> <mo>⁢</mo> <msub> <mi>f</mi> <mrow> <mn>3</mn> <mo>⁢</mo> <mstyle> <mspace width="0.3em" height="0.3ex"> </mspace> </mstyle> <mo>⁢</mo> <mi>dB</mi> </mrow> </msub> </mrow> </mfrac> </mrow> </math> </maths> </p>
    <p num="p-0098">Where f<sub>r </sub>is the resonance frequency, and Δf<sub>3 dB </sub>shown as points a and b in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, is the bandwidth of the band stop filter <b>146</b>. Bandwidth is typically taken as the difference between the two measured frequencies, f<sub>1 </sub>and f<sub>2</sub>, at the 3 dB loss points as measured on an insertion loss chart, and the resonance frequency is the average between f<sub>1 </sub>and f<sub>2</sub>. As can be seen in this relationship, higher Q values result in a narrower 3 dB bandwidth.</p>
    <p num="p-0099">Material and application parameters must be taken into consideration when designing tank filters. Most capacitor dielectric materials age 1%-5% in capacitance values per decade of time elapsed, which can result in a shift of the resonance frequency of upwards of 2.5%. In a high-Q filter, this could result in a significant and detrimental drop in the band stop filter performance. A lower-Q filter would minimize the effects of resonance shift and would allow a wider frequency band through the filter. However, very low Q filters display lower than desirable attenuation behavior at the desired band stop frequency (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, curve <b>162</b>). For this reason, the optimum Q for the band stop filter of the present invention will embody a high Q inductor L and a relatively low Q capacitor C which will result in a medium Q tank filter as shown in curve <b>164</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0100">Accordingly, the “Q” or quality factor of the tank circuit is very important. As mentioned, it is desirable to have a very low loss circuit at low frequencies such that the biological signals not be undesirably attenuated. The quality factor not only determines the loss of the filter, but also affects its 3 dB bandwidth. If one does a plot of the filter response curve (Bode plot), the 3 dB bandwidth determines how sharply the filter will rise and fall. With reference to curve <b>166</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, for a tank that is resonant at 128 MHz, an ideal response would be one that had infinite attenuation at 128 MHz, but had zero attenuation at low frequencies below 1 KHz. Obviously, this is not possible given the space limitations and the realities of the parasitic losses within components. In other words, it is not possible (other than at cryogenic temperatures) to build an inductor that has zero internal resistance. On the other hand, it is not possible to build a perfect (ideal) capacitor either. Capacitors have internal resistance known as equivalent series resistance and also have small amounts of inductance. Accordingly, the practical realization of a circuit, to accomplish the purposes of the present invention, is a challenging one.</p>
    <p num="p-0101">The performance of the circuit is directly related to the efficiency of both the inductor and the capacitor; the less efficient each component is, the more heat loss that results, and this can be expressed by the addition of resistor elements to the ideal circuit diagram. The effect of lower Q in the tank circuit is to broaden the resonance peak about the resonance frequency. By deliberately using a low Q capacitor, one can broaden the resonance such that a high impedance (high attenuation) is presented at multiple MRI RF frequencies, for example 64 MHz and 128 MHz.</p>
    <p num="p-0102">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, one can see curve <b>164</b> wherein a low resistive loss high Q inductor has been used in combination with a relatively high ESR low Q capacitor. This has a very desirable effect in that at very low frequencies, the impedance of the tank circuit <b>146</b> is essentially zero ohms (or zero dB loss). This means that biologic frequencies are not undesirably attenuated. However, one can see that the 3 db bandwidth is much larger. This is desirable as it will block multiple RF frequencies. As one goes even higher in frequency, curve <b>164</b> will desirably attenuate other high frequency EMI signals, such as those from cellular telephones, microwave ovens and the like. Accordingly, it is often desirable that very low loss inductors be used in combination with relatively high loss (and/or high inductance) capacitors to achieve a medium or lower Q band stop filter. Again referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, one can see that if the Q of the overall circuit or of the individual components becomes too low, then we have a serious degradation in the overall attenuation of the band stop filter at the MRI pulse frequencies. Accordingly, a careful balance between component design and tank circuit Q must be achieved.</p>
    <p num="p-0103">Referring once again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, one can also increase the value of R<sub>C </sub>by adding a separate discrete component in series with the capacitor element. For example, one could install a small capacitor chip that had a very low equivalent series resistance and place it in series with a resistor chip. This would be done to deliberately raise the value of R<sub>C </sub>in the circuit as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. By carefully adjusting this value of R<sub>C</sub>, one could then achieve the ideal curve <b>164</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0104"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is a tracing of an actual patient X-ray. This particular patient required both a cardiac pacemaker <b>100</b>C and an implantable cardioverter defibrillator <b>1001</b>. The corresponding implantable lead wire system <b>104</b>, as one can see, makes for a very complicated antenna and loop coupling situation. The reader is referred to the article entitled, “Estimation of Effective Lead Loop Area for Implantable Pulse Generator and Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators” provided by the AAMI Pacemaker EMC Task Force.</p>
    <p num="p-0105">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, one can see that from the pacemaker <b>100</b>C, there is an electrode in both the right atrium and in the right ventricle. Both these involve a TIP and RING electrode. In the industry, this is known as a dual chamber bipolar lead wire system. Accordingly, the band stop filters <b>146</b> of the present invention would need to be placed at least in the distal TIP in the right atrium and the distal TIP in the right ventricle from the cardiac pacemaker. One can also see that the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) <b>1001</b> is implanted directly into the right ventricle. Its shocking TIP and perhaps its super vena cava (SVC) shock coil would also require a band stop filters of the present invention so that MRI exposure cannot induce excessive currents into the associated lead wire system (S). Modern implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) incorporate both pacing and cardioverting (shock) features. Accordingly, it is becoming quite rare for a patient to have a lead wire layout as shown in the X-ray of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. However, the number of electrodes remain the same. There are also newer combined pacemaker/ICD systems which include biventricular pacemaking (pacing of the left ventricle). These systems can have as many as 9 to even 12 lead wires.</p>
    <p num="p-0106"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is a line drawing of an actual patient cardiac X-ray of one of the newer bi-ventricular lead wire systems with various types of electrode TIPS shown. The new bi-ventricular systems are being used to treat congestive heart failure, and make it possible to implant leads outside of the left ventricle. This makes for a very efficient pacing system; however, the implantable lead wire system <b>104</b> is quite complex. When a lead wire system <b>104</b>, such as those described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>, are exposed to a time varying electromagnetic field, electric currents can be induced into such lead wire systems. For the bi-ventricular system, band stop filters <b>146</b> would be required at each of the three distal TIPs and optionally at RING and SVC locations.</p>
    <p num="p-0107"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> illustrates a single chamber bipolar cardiac pacemaker lead wire showing the distal TIP <b>142</b> and the distal RING <b>144</b> electrodes. This is a spiral wound system where the RING coil <b>104</b> is wrapped around the TIP coil <b>104</b>′. There are other types of pacemaker lead wire systems in which these two leads lay parallel to one another (known as a bifilar lead system).</p>
    <p num="p-0108"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> is a schematic illustration of the area <b>27</b>-<b>27</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>. In the area of the distal TIP <b>142</b> and RING <b>144</b> electrodes, band stop filters <b>146</b> and <b>146</b>′ have been placed in series with each of the respective TIP and RING circuits. Accordingly, at MRI pulsed frequencies, an open circuit will be presented thereby stopping the flow of undesirable RF current.</p>
    <p num="p-0109">Although several embodiments of the invention have been described in detail, for purposes of illustration, various modifications of each may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not to be limited, except as by the appended claims.</p>
