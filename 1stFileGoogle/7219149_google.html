The terminals can use different protocols and typically incorporate card readers for completing financial or other types of transactions typically involving credit, debit, ATM or similar cards. The terminal adapter provides reliable and secure communication using a network based in part on the Internet as a primary form of communication. The terminal adapter also provides a secondary communication path in the event of a failure of the primary communication path, as well as automatic recognition of different terminal protocols, various security functions, error detection, and other network administration functions to ensure a flexible system and efficient transaction processing system."><meta name="DC.date" content="2007-5-15"

content="A terminal adapter, along with a value added network, is disclosed that interworks a plurality of terminals with a processing host to accomplish transaction processing. The terminals can use different protocols and typically incorporate card readers for completing financial or other types of transactions typically involving credit, debit, ATM or similar cards. The terminal adapter provides reliable and secure communication using a network based in part on the Internet as a primary form of communication. The terminal adapter also provides a secondary communication path in the event of a failure of the primary communication path, as well as automatic recognition of different terminal protocols, various security functions, error detection, and other network administration functions to ensure a flexible system and efficient transaction processing system."/><meta property="og:title" content="Patent US7219149 - Versatile terminal adapter and network for transaction processing"/><meta property="og:type" content="book"/><meta property="og:site_name" content="Google Books"/><meta property="og:image" content="http://www.google.com/patents?id=&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1"/><link rel="image_src" href="http://www.google.com/patents?id=&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1"/><script>(function(){try{var aa=function(a,b,c,d){d=d||{};d._sn=["cfg",b,c].join(".");window.gbar.logger.ml(a,d)};var g=window.gbar=window.gbar||{},l=window.gbar.i=window.gbar.i||{},m={},n;function _tvn(a,b){var c=parseInt(a,10);return isNaN(c)?b:c}function _tvf(a,b){var c=parseFloat(a);return isNaN(c)?b:c}function _tvv(a){return!!a}function p(a,b,c){(c||g)[a]=b}g.bv={n:_tvn("2",0),r:"",f:".67.",e:"0",m:_tvn("0",1)};

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0002">This invention generally relates to terminal adapters for terminals originating financial transactions, including credit/debit card readers, automatic teller machines, and point of sale terminals. Specifically, terminals using various access protocols interact with a transaction oriented value added network using a versatile terminal adapter facilitating interaction of the terminal with a host processor, wherein the host is also connected to the network. In one embodiment, the terminal adapter uses a wide area network, such as the Internet, as a primary means of accessing the value added network, and uses dial-up telephone service as a secondary means of accessing the value added network in the event of failure of the primary communication means. A network operations center manages the transaction oriented value added network for optimal performance.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">Electronic real-time transaction processing is common in many industries, including retail sales, inventory control, and healthcare. Businesses utilize devices such as card readers, including those reading magnetically encoded cards, to increase productivity and accuracy of various types of transactions. A common application is the use of credit cards for purchasing goods and services in retail sales. Many retailers have deployed automated card readers to facilitate credit and debit card authorization processing by store personnel. Not only do automated card readers provide greater accuracy than manually keying information at time of purchase, they offer greater speed, convenience, and accuracy. Today, it is common for each point-of-sale (POS) terminal to have an integrated card reader or have the terminal connected to a nearby card reader.</p>
    <p num="p-0004">Typically, a card reader communicates with a host financial transaction processor using a dedicated phone line. The card reader incorporates a standard modem implemented by a single, low-cost integrated circuit based on modem standards such as V.22, V.22 bis, or V.34. The card reader dials a programmed telephone number (usually local or toll-free) and establishes a telephone connection via a network with the host processor. The card reader transmits the transaction information including the card number, a transaction number, and purchase amount to a host. The host processor accepts or declines the transaction and responds by returning an authorization number. This type of transaction typically occurs quickly as it is desirable to minimize delay and increase customer satisfaction.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">Many businesses have a single point-of-sale terminal, and thus require a phone line for handling card authorizations. This is usually in addition to a voice telephone line, used by the business, since the phone line is usually dedicated for the card reader. If the telephone line is shared with a telephone for voice communication, then operation becomes inconvenient, often resulting in delaying card authorizations or voice calls. For businesses having multiple POS terminals, a plurality of telephone lines are dedicated to the card readers, often on a shared basis. While sharing telephone lines among card readers allows some cost savings, this still may result in delays for a given card reader, depending on the current card authorization volume and the number of telephone lines. For a growing business with an increasing volume of card transactions or increase in the number of card readers, constantly monitoring and determining when to add new phone lines is difficult and distracting to the core business functions of the retailer. However, use of dedicated phone lines typically does provide a high degree of reliability and security.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">Many businesses now have Internet access to supplement various business functions. Internet access is often provided to various workers at personal computers using an internal local area network (LAN) providing gateway access to an Internet Service Provider (ISP). The physical communication facility between the LAN and the ISP may be of various types, including digital private line, optical fiber, ISDN, DSL, cable modem, wireless, satellite, etc. Typically, digital access arrangements provide higher data communication speeds compared to dial-up connections. Using a LAN to access the Internet allows multiple users to access the Internet at the same time. While simultaneous usage may slow down response times, one user does not ‘block’ access by another, as is the case when a single telephone line is shared by multiple users or devices. Further, the cost of accessing the Internet does not necessarily require additional fees for each simultaneous user accessing the Internet. In contrast, simultaneous access via telephone lines requires a plurality of telephone lines, each of which has a discrete incremental cost.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">If retailers could configure their card readers to utilize the Internet for accessing the host processor, the telephone lines dedicated for the card readers would not be required, thus reducing costs for the retailers. However, the use of separate telephone lines does provide the advantage of a reliable and redundant communication architecture. Replacing all the telephone lines with a single Internet access arrangement provides a single point of communication failure rendering all the card readers in the retailer's location non-functional if Internet access is unavailable. The potential for lost profits, even for a relatively short outage, can more than justify the higher cost of using separate telephone lines. Consequently, it would be desirable to have the advantages of Internet access while retaining the reliability and security of a dial-up connection.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">U.S. Pat. No. 5,526,409 discloses the use of a second telephone line that can be used as a secondary means of communication in the event the primary telephone line or modem is inoperable. However, using a single telephone line as the primary communication facility limits the data communication speed for transmitting data and limits the destination to a single host. Nor does the patent disclose automatically switching to the second telephone line or automatically switching back to the primary telephone line.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">U.S. Pat. No. 5,778,173 discloses using the Internet by a personal computer to facilitate a financial transaction, such as a purchase. However, the complete transaction is not carried out using the Internet; a portion of the transaction conveying sensitive information is sent using a modem on a dial-up telephone connection. This arrangement still requires a dedicated phone line for each terminal and increases cost.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">Therefore, what is needed is a system for using existing card reader terminals for accessing a host financial processor using an inexpensive, reliable, and secure transaction processing network while providing backup communication to ensure reliable and secure transaction processing.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0011">Generally described, the present invention interworks a terminal, typically incorporating a magnetic card reader, with a host processor by using a terminal adapter operating in conjunction with a network.

Further, although the principles of the present invention are illustrated using certain types of embodiments, communication infrastructures, and categories of transaction types, it will be readily appreciated that other communication networks or devices could incorporate the principles of the present invention for a variety of transaction types.</p>
    <heading>SYSTEM OVERVIEW</heading> <p num="p-0034">A system perspective of one embodiment of the invention is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the terminals of system <b>1</b> are typically located on the premises of a business, such as a retail store, bank, merchant, etc. although it is not restricted to commercial sales applications. A common example is a card reader <b>2</b> located in a retail store, which can be a credit card reader, debit card reader, or any other type of magnetic card reader, optical card reader, or ‘smart’ card reader. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the card reader <b>2</b> is illustrated as directly connected to the Terminal Adapter. The connection between the card reader and the Terminal Adapter can use a variety of connection means, and frequently incorporates an RJ-11 telephone-type jack based on a Plain Old Telephone (POTS) interface. Specifically, the card reader expects to interface with the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), which the Terminal Adapter emulates.</p>
    <p num="p-0035"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also illustrates a plurality of card readers <b>4</b>, which can be of the same type as the previous card reader <b>2</b>, but which are connected to a multi-card reader controller <b>6</b>. The controller <b>6</b> aggregates a plurality of card readers and multiplexes their transactions onto a single communication facility. In this illustration, the controller <b>6</b> is connected to the Terminal Adapter <b>14</b>. The interface presented by the Terminal Adapter <b>14</b> to the card reader <b>2</b> could be the same interface presented by the Terminal Adapter <b>14</b> to the multi-card-reader controller <b>6</b>. These are but two of many arrangements that may be used to connect a terminal to the Terminal Adapter. For example, one embodiment of the Terminal Adapter connects several identical card readers <b>2</b>, one terminal to each interface of the Terminal Adapter <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0036">The terminal is not restricted to being a card reader, but may be a more sophisticated device, such as an Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) <b>8</b>. This type of terminal performs financial transactions, although the nature of the transaction may be more complicated or varied than that of a credit card authorization associated with the previously identified card readers <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>. The ATM <b>8</b> is illustrated as directly connected to the Terminal Adapter <b>14</b> and the ATM and Terminal adapter can be co-located together or remotely located from each other. Again, various communication arrangements may be used to effect the communication between the ATM terminal and Terminal Adapter <b>14</b> including the use of multi-terminal controllers <b>6</b> previously disclosed.</p>
    <p num="p-0037">Finally, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also illustrates a personal computer (PC) based Point-of-Sale (POS) terminal <b>10</b> having an integrated card reader <b>11</b> accessing the Terminal Adapter <b>14</b> via a modem <b>12</b>. The POS terminal is typically a personal computer adapted for POS applications using standard operating software, such as the Microsoft Windows™ operating system and controls the modem using one of several command languages, such as the Hayes™ compatible modem command or XON/XOFF commands. Those skilled in the art will recognize that alternative configurations are possible. For example, the POS terminal <b>10</b> could interface with the Terminal Adapter <b>14</b> using a USB cable connected to USB ports, a serial RS-232, or RS-422 interface. Alternatively, the modem functions, or subset thereof, may exist in the POS terminal or in the Terminal Adapter as a virtual device driver. If the modem functionality is integrated into the Terminal Adapter, it could be a ‘software’ modem or virtual modem. Specifically, driver software emulating a modem's command interface in the Terminal Adapter allows the POS terminal to interact with the Terminal Adapter as if there were an actual hardware modem connected to the POS' serial interface. The POS terminal issues standard modem commands via the serial interface that are, in turn, processed by the Terminal Adapter emulation software. Further, the functionality of the Terminal Adapter can be integrated into the personal computer or the POS terminal by defining a ‘softmodem’ or virtual modem. Alternatively, the softmodem could be implemented in a client-server system comprising terminals and a server.</p>
    <p num="p-0038">Other variations are possible, including the Terminal Adapter providing interfaces incorporating a poll select asynchronous packet based protocol, such as the X3.28-1976 ISO protocol, X.25, frame relay, or bisync protocol to interface with other types of terminals. Further, the invention is not limited to card reading or POS terminals, but includes terminals conducting transactions based on other inputs, including badge readers, OCR scanners, RF identifier tag readers, sensors, special purpose personal computers, computers processing manual keyboard input, or any other type of transaction-oriented processing device. Additionally, the card reader need not be synonymous with the terminal or incorporated in the terminal, and instead, the terminal can be considered to have, or comprise, a card reader so long as the terminal, such as the POS embodiment, is in communication with a card reader or similar functioning input device. Although a preferred embodiment of the present invention is directed to financial transactions, the principles of the present invention could apply to transactions of a non-financial nature, such as telemetry, alarm, maintenance, health care, pharmacy, or other applications typically involving card readers for ‘card swipe’ transaction processing.</p>
    <p num="p-0039">The Terminal Adapter <b>14</b> can be considered as having a ‘front end’ comprising the terminal interfaces <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>10</b>. The front end of the Terminal Adapter can be configured in a variety of ways, including interfacing a single terminal or a plurality of terminals. If a plurality of devices are interfaced, then the interfaces may be identical (e.g., all POTS based), all different (e.g., a POTS and RS-232 serial interface), or a hybrid combination (e.g., two POTS interfaces and two RS-232 interfaces). In one embodiment, four POTS type interfaces are provided and in another embodiment, two POTS type interfaces and two asynchronous RS-232 interfaces are provided. Obviously, other combinations of interfaces on the front end are possible and are dictated primarily by commercial business motivations, capacity, and cost concerns.</p>
    <p num="p-0040">The Terminal Adapter <b>14</b> can also be considered as having a ‘back end’ comprising network interfaces interconnecting with network communication facilities. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the Terminal Adapter <b>14</b> has two network interfaces on the back end. One interface <b>16</b> is an Ethernet interface; typically connecting to a LAN <b>18</b> and designated the primary interface. This interface could be a 10BaseT type of Ethernet access, although those skilled in the art will readily recognize other types of LAN/MAN access standards could be used such as FDDI, token ring, token bus, 802.11x, etc. The LAN <b>18</b> facilitates interconnection <b>26</b> with the Internet <b>20</b>, since the Terminal Adapter may not always be in close proximity to the interface to the Internet interface. For example, a store operating multiple sales stations may have a Terminal Adapter located in the store connected via the primary interface <b>16</b> to the corporate LAN <b>18</b> that in turn then provides access to the Internet <b>20</b>. The LAN also isolates the Terminal Adapter from the various Internet access arrangements. For example, the Terminal Adapter <b>14</b> is isolated from changes or upgrades in the physical connection <b>26</b> to the Internet, whether it be DSL, wireless, T<b>1</b>, etc.</p>
    <p num="p-0041">The LAN <b>18</b> in turn interfaces to the Internet <b>20</b> using one of the variety of communication facilities <b>26</b>, including: DSL, T<b>1</b>, T<b>3</b>, dial-up, ISDN, optical fiber, cable modems, WiFi, satellite, etc. The Terminal Adapter accesses the Internet interface on the back end using either the PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet) protocol or the DHCP protocol when using Ethernet access. PPPoE and DHCP are well known approaches to achieve TCP/IP access to the Internet over Ethernet and are well known in the art of data communications. The primary interface <b>16</b> is preferably a high-speed interface, at least fast enough to accommodate the transaction volume of the plurality of terminals.</p>
    <p num="p-0042">The Terminal Adapter <b>14</b> may also have a secondary interface <b>22</b> on the back end illustrated by a connection to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). The second interface provides back up communication capability in the event the primary communication path is inoperable and typically operates at a slower speed than the primary interface. This secondary interface typically uses a telephone line and the Terminal Adapter typically incorporates an integrated modem and PPP access protocol. The PPP is well known in the area of data communications for obtaining TCP/IP access to the Internet over dial-up. The PSTN is noted for its reliability and ubiquitous availability, although dial-up access speed is limited. However, it is usually the case that a business location will have a telephone line for dial-up access for voice that can intermittently be used for dial-up access to an ISP, whereas alternative access methods (such as DSL) are not nearly as common. However, the Terminal Adapter <b>14</b> could incorporate such alternative access arrangements for the secondary interface, including: DSL, ISDN, frame relay, X.25, or some other communication protocol for the secondary interface. The secondary interface could even be the same type as the primary interface. Typically, the secondary interface is based on modems providing speeds of 28.8 Kbps or 56 Kbps (e.g., V.34 or V.90), although other rates could be used.</p>
    <p num="p-0043">The Terminal Adapter of this embodiment relies on connectivity to the PSTN for secondary access in the situation where the primary communication path is not functional in two ways. First, a preferred embodiment uses a facility <b>30</b> to access the Internet <b>20</b> to provide an alternative route to the Network <b>33</b> so that the same set of services are provided. A second embodiment incorporates a facility <b>32</b> directly connecting the Transaction Processor <b>36</b>. In this embodiment, the Transaction Processor <b>36</b> could implement the processes for providing the same value added services as provided by the aforementioned infrastructure <b>28</b>, or alternatively, the Financial Transaction Processor may not provide the additional services and allow the secondary communication path to have a reduced level of functionality, while still providing connectivity. This may be an acceptable business alternative, since transaction applications using a point-to-point POTS connection between the Terminal Adapter and Transaction Processor may find it acceptable to operate without all the value added services on an interim basis.</p>
    <p num="p-0044">The Internet <b>20</b> provides a communication infrastructure for transporting information and provides a set of well-known services using the TCP/IP protocol stack. However, the needs of the terminals to perform financial transactions (or, other applications as previously noted) may not fully be served by the data communication services provided by the Internet. For this reason, various service extensions are required. These Value Added Services <b>28</b> are provided by various Nodes connected to the Internet operating an additional protocol on top of the TCP/IP stack. Together, the Internet and the Nodes provide enhanced services and comprise the Network <b>33</b>. Although the Internet may be associated with one embodiment, the Value Added Service Network could be comprised of various Nodes operating on top of other networks such as WANs, LANs, or virtual private networks based on a variety of technologies. The value added services provided by the Network provide additional security, reliability, and flexibility to facilitate other functions that will be described in further detail. This architecture is based on the concept of protocol layers and is well known in the art of data communications.</p>
    <p num="p-0045"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> further expands on one possible embodiment of the Internet <b>20</b> and Value Added Services <b>28</b> that comprise the Value Added Network <b>33</b>. As is well known, the “Internet” is not a single network, but a collection of networks operating in a cohesive manner. This is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by depicting the Internet <b>20</b> as two interconnected Internet Service Providers <b>27</b>. In practice, there are literally thousands of such networks comprising the “Internet.” The services provided by the Internet use the TCP/IP protocol and are well known, but may not be sufficient in terms of reliability and security for transaction processing. Consequently, Nodes <b>25</b> are defined providing these additional functions in the Network.</p>
    <p num="p-0046">The Nodes <b>25</b> are connected to the Internet and may be directly interconnected as well (not shown). While three Nodes are illustrated, in practice there may be many more, deployed in diverse geographic areas, replicated for redundancy, and interconnected for reliability. Further, some Nodes <b>25</b> may be collocated or integrated with other equipment, such as the Transaction Host Processors <b>36</b> or Internet routers, LANS, gateways, bridges or PBX's.</p>
    <p num="p-0047">There are three types of Nodes that typically implement the value added services and these are the Client Node <b>25</b> <i>a, </i>the Core Node <b>25</b> <i>b, </i>and the Service Node <b>25</b> <i>c. </i>The Client Node <b>25</b> <i>a </i>interfaces with the Terminal Adapter, typically using the transport capabilities of the Internet. Although not illustrated, it is possible that the Terminal Adapter could directly connect to the Client Node <b>25</b> <i>a </i>using any number of communication facilities. This would represent an embodiment where the Client Node and Internet router functionality are integrated. The Client Node <b>25</b> <i>a </i>recognizes the Terminal Adapter <b>14</b> and performs synchronization, security, authentication, and error detection functions in addition to relaying and/or interworking information to the Core Node <b>25</b> <i>b. </i>The Core Node is not always required, but if present, it relays information across the same or different ISP providers <b>27</b>. The Core Node <b>25</b> <i>b </i>may relay information to other Core Nodes or to a Service Node <b>25</b> <i>c </i>as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. When the Core Node routes to another Core Node, it can route the transactions to the least busy Core Node, or reroute to an alternative Node in case of a Node failure. The Service Node <b>25</b> <i>c </i>interfaces with the Transaction Host Processor (“Host”) <b>36</b> using any number of point-to-point facilities <b>34</b>. The Service Node converts the protocols used when receiving transaction from another Node to the protocol used in communicating with the Host <b>36</b>. In general, many of the services and features the Terminal Adapter provides with respect to a terminal can be provided by a Service Node to a Host Processor. Thus, for example, a Host Processor could initiate a transaction to another Host. Typically, the connection <b>34</b> from the Service Node to the Host is a high-speed digital facility capable of multiplexing significant numbers of transactions.</p>
    <p num="p-0048">Since reliability is a major concern in financial and other types of transactions, the Nodes <b>25</b> are typically replicated in diverse locations. For example, the Service Node is duplicated (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) in a diverse geographical location and also connected to the Host processor so that the Host can continue to communicate to an alternative Service Node if one Service Node or communication path fails. The Service Nodes may be load balanced (e.g., each typically providing 50% of the total transaction traffic to the Host) or configured with one Node as a hot standby (providing 100% of the transaction capacity, but switchable to the other Node when required). Similarly, each Service Node is typically connected to a plurality of Core Nodes. Those skilled in the art of network architecture will recognize the various arrangements that can be used for providing reliable access between the Host and the Terminal Adapter. Further, the Host may be replicated in a geographic diverse location for redundancy and reliability reasons.</p>
    <p num="p-0049"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also illustrates a Network Operations Center (NOC) <b>29</b> connected to the various Nodes <b>25</b>. The NOC <b>29</b> administers and manages the operation of the Nodes and Terminal Adapters with respect to the Network. With respect to the Nodes, the NOC receives measurements, alarm information, traffic statistics, load levels, and similar information and acts accordingly. For example, if a Node is not functioning correctly, adjacent Nodes will reroute around the non-functioning Node. The NOC becomes aware of the status of the non-functioning Node and can monitor the status of the Node while the problem is investigated and corrected. With respect to Terminal Adapters, the NOC is also aware of their operation and maintains a profile for each Terminal Adapter <b>14</b> and its corresponding Client Node <b>25</b> <i>a. </i>This allows the NOC to know the current network conditions and operating status of each element, including both Nodes and Terminal Adapters.</p>
    <p num="p-0050">The NOC can further communicate indirectly to the Terminal Adapter by sending management messages relayed by the appropriate Node by piggybacking messages with the parameter file fetch response. The NOC (via the Network) can send a command to reset the Terminal Adapter, direct the Terminal Adapter to switch from its primary communication path to its secondary communication path, or switch to a different Client Node.</p>
    <p num="h-0007">Normal Operation</p>
    <p num="p-0051">The normal operation of the Terminal Adapter is typically divided into two phases: pre-transaction processing and transaction processing transfer. Several functions must be accomplished in the pre-transaction processing phase in order to communicate transactions in the data transfer phase. In this context, ‘pre-transaction processing’ refers to actions occurring prior to the processing of terminal originated transactions. As will be discovered, the Terminal Adapter uses the transaction protocol procedures to bootstrap itself in order to subsequently process transactions from the terminal. Thus, transaction messaging is used between the Terminal Adapter and the Network in the ‘pre transaction processing’ phase.</p>
    <p num="p-0052">Because various aspects of the pre-transaction processing and transaction processing phase generally rely on data that is hardcoded into the Terminal Adapter, this data is briefly discussed. In other embodiments, such as the softmodem incorporated into a PC, the PC manufacturer obviously does not hardcode these values into the PC's firmware. In these embodiments, these values are programmed into the device manually or loaded by reading a file.</p>
    <p num="p-0053">Embedded Data</p>
    <p num="p-0054">One type of data manufactured in the firmware of each Terminal Adapter of one embodiment is a Terminal Adapter Identifier value that uniquely identifies the device. This value may in the format of: &lt;manufacturer id&gt; &lt;model number&gt; &lt;serial number&gt; &lt;suffix&gt;. This structure forms a 24 byte identifier, although other structures and values may be used to achieve a unique identifier programmed into the Terminal Adapter. For example, the MAC address (associated with the Ethernet network interface) could be concatenated with the serial number and used as an identifier. The Terminal Adapter Identifier is typically sent in all messages to identify the particular Terminal Adapter to the Network and allows in part, the Network and NOC to maintain status and service profile information for each Terminal Adapter.</p>
    <p num="p-0055">Another instance of data programmed into the Terminal Adapter of one embodiment is a secret key used in encryption and authentication. The secret key value is not communicated over the interface, but used both by the Terminal Adapter and the Network to encrypt information that is communicated over the interface. As is well known, the use of encryption also facilitates authentication of a particular Terminal Adapter. Authentication can be accomplished by the Terminal Adapter and Network encrypting a common data value, exchanging and then comparing the result. Only if the Terminal Adapter has the correct secret key will its encrypted value match the Network's value. As for using the secret key for encrypting transactions, encryption is accomplished using a key derived from the secret key, the session token and the transaction counter. In this manner, if an unauthorized user cracks a message, the secret key is not revealed, and hence other messages are not compromised.</p>
    <p num="p-0056">The Terminal Adapter of one embodiment also stores a default Configuration Service Name that describes the parameter file version currently held in non-volatile memory. In this embodiment a value is programmed into the Terminal Adapter describing the parameter file version initially present at power up, but then a dynamically determined value is obtained from the Network and supercedes the default value.</p>
    <p num="p-0057">Another instance of data programmed into the Terminal Adapter of one embodiment is a default Service Name. The Service Name is a default URL of a server providing ‘bootstrap’ address information, typically in the form of a set of Client Nodes IP addresses that the Terminal Adapter uses to interact with for transactions and management functions (e.g., parameter downloading). Usually, a Terminal Adapter uses a single address for these functions, but for various reasons including reliability, alternative values are provided.</p>
    <p num="p-0058">These values are programmed into the Terminal Adapter as default values. In many cases, the default values are typically augmented with dynamically determined values provided by the Network as part of the bootstrap process. The dynamically obtained values do not erase the default values (recall that the default values are hardcoded into the Terminal Adapter), but the Terminal Adapter stores both and knows by the presence of the dynamic values that the default values have been superceded.</p>
    <p num="p-0059">Pre-Transaction Processing Phase</p>
    <p num="p-0060">Upon power up, the Terminal Adapter generally executes several related procedures. In one embodiment, these are: Service Discovery, Synchronization and Authentication, Parameter Downloading, and Software Downloading. All are executed upon initially powering up the Terminal Adapter, but thereafter, the procedures may be invoked separately. Upon initial powering up, the Terminal Adapter of this embodiment first invokes a Service Discovery process to obtain a list of IP addresses that correspond to Client Nodes. This is accomplished by sending a Service Discovery request using the service name address that is permanently encoded into the Terminal Adapter.</p>
    <p num="p-0061">The Terminal Adapter of this embodiment then synchronizes and authenticates itself to the Network. These procedures occur together, so that authentication follows whenever synchronization occurs. Thus, ‘synchronization’ implies synchronization and authorization wherever context dictates such. Synchronization is generally required prior to sending transaction requests, and occurs frequently after the Terminal Adapter has initially powered up. For example, if the Terminal Adapter has been idle for a long period, re-synchronization may be required. Synchronization is discussed in detail in conjunction with the normal transaction transfer, so that this explanation can focus on the initial power up functions.</p>
    <p num="p-0062">After synchronization, the Terminal Adapter of this embodiment selects one of the IP addresses obtained using service discovery and uses it to initiate a parameter download using a transaction request. As discussed subsequently, this is of the form known as a ‘simple’ transaction request. The parameter file contains various configuration and address information to facilitate operation of the Terminal Adapter. The parameters may indicate, in part: where transactions should be sent to, primary and secondary communication path information, and where to obtain new software applications for software downloads. The Terminal Adapter typically downloads a parameter file by indicating its current parameter file version to the Network. This is an implicit request to the Network to indicate whether a more current version exists. Upon initial powering up, this value indicated by the Terminal Adapter is typically the default Configuration Service Name encoded into the Terminal Adapter. When the Network receives the default Configuration Service Name, it knows to route the request to a specified process server and a configuration version number of zero indicates that the Terminal Adapter is requesting an initial parameter download. The Network responds by sending the current name of the parameter file version along with the parameter data.</p>
    <p num="p-0063">Next, the Terminal Adapter of this embodiment examines certain parameters in the parameter file to determine whether a software download should occur. Software download refers to downloading new application code (binary image file) for execution. The Terminal Adapter examines the binary image name of the most recent executable file as indicated by the Network in the parameter file and compares it with the current value stored in memory. If the Terminal Adapter finds a different executable file indicated compared to what is stored in default memory (which is likely the case upon initial powering up), the Terminal Adapter fetches the new executable file. The location to fetch the executed file from is typically indicated by an address in the parameter file. After the Terminal Adapter loads and executes the current application, it is ready to process transactions from a terminal. Thus, the transaction processing phase is ready to start.</p>
    <p num="p-0064">Transaction Processing Phase</p>
    <p num="p-0065">Prior to sending a transaction, the Terminal Adapter is typically synchronized and authenticated to the Network. This generally occurs during initial power up, but may be required again. Resynchronization occurs frequently and is considered normal operating procedure. Synchronization facilitates orderly transaction processing between the Network (specifically, the Client Node) and the Terminal Adapter, as well as enhancing the security of the transaction by exchanging a new session token. Resynchronization may be required if errors occur when the Terminal Adapter switches from the primary to secondary communication path, or when the Terminal Adapter switches from one Client Node to another. Authentication is required to ensure the Network is communicating with a trusted entity and to pass encryption parameters (e.g., a session token, as discussed subsequently) to the Terminal Adapter.</p>
    <p num="p-0066">In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the Terminal Adapter <b>301</b> first opens a TCP connection with the Network <b>303</b> in step <b>300</b>. The Terminal Adapter sends a synchronization request at step <b>302</b> and includes a transaction counter (TC) in the header of the message. Thereafter in subsequent transactions, the Network will expect the transaction counter to be incremented over the current value each time a transaction is sent. If the Network receives an unexpected value, an error code is returned to the Terminal Adapter and the Terminal Adapter is required to re-synchronize its transaction counter. Re-synchronization is required under various conditions, including: the Terminal Adapter being idle for a long period, switching from primary to secondary communication paths, or being unable to complete a transaction.</p>
    <p num="p-0067">The Network records the TC value and computes a Message Digest. A message digest is a condensed text string that has been distilled from the contents of a text message where its value is derived using a one-way hash function and is used to create a digital signature. The Network may use a particular form known as a Message Digest 5 (MD5) based on a Random Value (RV) and the Transaction Counter (TC). This is returned in a Synchronization Response at step <b>304</b> that signifies synchronization has occurred and that the Terminal Adapter should authenticate itself.</p>
    <p num="p-0068">The Terminal Adapter responds by formulating a Message Digest type 5 (MD5) based on a secret key (PUC) and the transaction counter (TC) in step <b>306</b> and sending it to the Network. The Network compares this value with its previously computed value, and assuming a match, returns a response in step <b>308</b> indicating authentication has successfully occurred and includes a session token (ST). The session token is encrypted using the Message Digest and is used by the Terminal Adapter to derive the key used for subsequent encryption/decryption in the data transfer phase. Finally, when completed, the Terminal Adapter may close the TCP connection in step <b>310</b>. Alternatively, the Terminal Adapter may leave the TCP connection open and avoid the additional steps of opening a TCP connection prior to entering a subsequent data transfer phase.</p>
    <p num="p-0069">There are alternative security and authentication means that could be used to authenticate and encrypt information, including other public and private key schemes such as RSA, PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), etc. Those skilled in the art will recognize that a variety of message types, formats, and encryption techniques could be used to accomplish the function of synchronizing and authenticating the Terminal Adapter and Network, but these are all within the principles of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0070">The Transaction Processing Phase is used to convey transactions initiating from the terminal, and in one embodiment, there are two methods to accomplish this: simple transactions and session transactions. The simple transaction is composed of a single request-response pair of messages. These are often used in credit card or ATM based transactions where a single message pair is sufficient to complete the transaction. The process is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0071">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the Terminal Adapter <b>400</b> communicates with the Network <b>402</b>, typically with a Client Node <b>25</b> <i>a. </i>The Network <b>402</b> also communicates with the Host <b>404</b>, which is the Financial Transaction Processor <b>36</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0072">The Terminal Adapter must open a TCP connection in step <b>406</b> if one has not already been opened. After that, a Simple Request <b>408</b> is sent to the Network, which then routes the message to the appropriate Host in step <b>410</b>. The Host processes the transaction <b>411</b> and responds in step <b>412</b>. The Network <b>402</b> receives the response and forwards it in step <b>414</b> to the Terminal Adapter <b>400</b>. The Terminal Adapter extracts the response <b>416</b> and sends the response to the Terminal (not shown). If there are additional transactions that can use the same TCP connection, then the process repeats at step <b>418</b>. If there are no further transactions, the Terminal Adapter will close the idle TCP connection at step <b>422</b> and any additional transactions at step <b>420</b> will result in re-opening a TCP connection at step <b>406</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0073">The other method for sending a transaction in this embodiment is using the Session Transaction. The Session Transaction is used for more complex transactions, such as settlement activities occurring at the end of day. For example, in some business implementations the POS terminal retains data for the financial transactions during the day and must send summary information to the Host for end-of-day settlements. A Session Transaction is composed of multiple request-response pairs and is more appropriate than the single request-response for transferring lengthy transactions. The Session Transaction is composed of multiple request-response pairs that are guaranteed to be delivered in sequential order to a Host on the same logical connection. When a Session Transaction is initiated, the Client Node initiates a session with the appropriate Service Node and the Service Node responds with session context information, such as address and port information. This allows the Client Node to map subsequent message associated with the session. If transaction data is provided by the terminal, the Client Node includes the data in the session initiation message, and the Service Node forwards this to the Host. The session context also enables the terminal adapter to continue a session using a different Client Node in the event that the initial Client Node becomes unavailable. This process is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0074"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the Terminal Adapter <b>500</b> communicating with the Network <b>502</b>, which in turn, communicates with the Host <b>504</b>. The Terminal Adapter must open a TCP connection in step <b>506</b> if one has not already been opened. Then, the Terminal Adapter communicates an Initiate Session request at step <b>508</b> to the Network, along with transaction data. The Network routes the message to the appropriate Host at step <b>510</b>. Specifically, the Client Node receives and relays the message to the Service Node, which then relays the message to the Host. The Host processes the transaction data at step <b>512</b> and conveys the response <b>514</b> to the Network and then conveyed again <b>516</b> to the Terminal Adapter. At this point, the Terminal Adapter in step <b>518</b> is prepared to send transaction data and the Network has established internal session tables for mapping subsequent terminal messages to a specified session and host. The Transaction Data is formulated at step <b>520</b> and a Session Transaction request is sent to the Network at step <b>522</b>, which then routes the request <b>524</b> to the Host, which processes the transaction <b>526</b>. The response <b>528</b> is conveyed to the Network and back <b>530</b> to the Terminal Adapter that extracts the response data <b>532</b>. If additional transactions are desired, the process repeats at step <b>531</b>. Once all the transaction request-response messages are conveyed, the Terminal Adapter then formats a Terminate Session request <b>534</b> and sends it to the Network at step <b>536</b>. If transaction data is included, the Network forwards it to the Host <b>538</b> and processes the message <b>540</b>. The Host sends a response <b>542</b> that is forwarded by the Network to the Terminal Adapter <b>544</b> in the Terminate Session message closing the session <b>546</b>. Once completed, the TCP connection can be closed <b>548</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0075">Both transaction forms have common aspects. First, transaction messages in either form incorporate a Terminal Adapter Identification Number. This may be the value hardcoded into the Terminal Adapter or, in the case of a PC executing software emulating a terminal adapter, the value can be programmed into the device. The Terminal Adapter Identification Number uniquely identifies the device connected to the Network <b>33</b>. This unique value allows the Network to maintain information for each Terminal Adapter using the Network. If an error condition exists the Network will be able to correlate the condition to a particular device and take action as necessary. This may include, for example, notifying appropriate service personnel to investigate a problem, such as a defective Terminal Adapter. Further, statistics regarding each transaction can be maintained and recorded for a given Terminal Adapter, allowing value added information to be mined from periodic reports.</p>
    <p num="p-0076">Second, both types of messages utilize error detection using well-known techniques, such as cyclic redundancy codes (CRC). This allows easy detection of errors in a transaction detectable by the Network, Host, or Terminal Adapter and ensures only uncorrupted data is processed.</p>
    <p num="p-0077">Further, both transaction forms utilize encryption based on a secret key that is programmed into the Terminal Adapter at the time of manufacture. The encryption schemes are based on the 3DES, AES, or any other scheme well known in the art. The 3DES and AES schemes encrypt multiples of 8 or 16 bytes cipher texts respectively, and when the cipher text is not a multiple of the block size, then the cipher text is zero padded to the appropriate length. The encryption key may be generated based on running MD5 on the concatenated value of the private key (known to the Terminal Adapter), the transaction counter, and the session token.</p>
    <p num="p-0078">Additionally, both transaction forms indicate a service name that is used by the Network to determine the appropriate host for processing the transaction. The Service Name is derived from the parameter download and is used by the Network to identify a particular Service Node to then deliver the transaction to the appropriate host.</p>
    <p num="p-0079">Those skilled in the art will recognize that the message formats for conveying this information can be of various formats. In one embodiment, messages indicate a packet type with values defined for session request/responses and simple transaction request/responses. A variety of encoding and structures can be used to convey the above information as well as encode the information.</p>
    <p num="p-0080">The above capabilities for communicating transactions between the Terminal, Network, and Host ensure that:
</p> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0080">only trusted entities are allowed to initiate a transaction with the Network;</li> <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0081">transactions are recognized in an orderly manner by the various entities;</li> <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0082">transactions are error checked at various points to ensure no errors occur during communication;</li> <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0083">transactions are encrypted prior to delivery to the Network to ensure unauthorized recipients cannot understand the contents; and</li> <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0084">Terminal Adapters are uniquely identified to allow correlation of transaction related events with a specific user of the Network.</li> </ul> <p num="p-0081">The system in which the Terminal Adapter operates can also be viewed with respect to the protocol stacks. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a protocol stack <b>650</b> is implemented in the card reader <b>2</b> comprising a POS application <b>651</b>, which is typically programmed at time of manufacturing. This application uses the services of a financial transaction protocol <b>652</b> such as the VISA-II (a.k.a. VISA-2) protocol to transmit credit card authorizations. This in turn, relies on a telephone protocol <b>653</b> that comprises the physical, modem and traditional dial-up procedures to communicate over a phone line <b>654</b> to the Terminal Adapter <b>14</b>. The Terminal Adapter containing protocol stack <b>656</b> receives the information over the telephone cable <b>654</b>, decodes the information using a corresponding telephone protocol <b>655</b>, and relays <b>657</b> the financial transaction protocol information over the backside interface. This ‘backside’ interface uses the value added services layer <b>658</b> to provide a secure and robust transmission of data to the host <b>636</b>. The value added services layer <b>658</b> uses the TCP/IP protocol layer <b>659</b> and incorporates the aforementioned authentication, synchronization, and encryption procedures for sending transactions. The transactions are communicated using the TCP/IP over Ethernet requiring the use of the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet protocol layer <b>660</b>. The LAN is typically a 10BaseT Ethernet connected via the Internet.</p>
    <p num="p-0082">Not all the protocol stacks for all the physical elements are illustrated, as they are not required to illustrate the principles of the present invention. For example, the Ethernet/Internet bridging the LAN and providing Internet access is not illustrated as it is transparent to the value added services layer and higher layers. Further, only one Value Added Service Node in the Network <b>33</b> is illustrated by the protocol stack <b>662</b>. This Node is a combination Client Node and Service Node as it interfaces both to the Terminal Adapter and the Host. In practice, a separate protocol stack for a Client Node and a Service Node would typically exist, communicating with each other using the Internet or other facilities. Those skilled in the art will recognize many other variations as well.</p>
    <p num="p-0083">The Value Added Service Node receives data via the lower layer <b>665</b>, processed by the TCP/IP layer <b>664</b> and then processed by the added services layer <b>663</b>. If acceptable, the data is relayed by the financial transaction protocol layer <b>666</b> back down a TCP/IP layer <b>667</b> and a physical layer <b>668</b>, which can be based on a variety of protocols (e.g., T<b>1</b>, DSL, etc.). The relaying layer <b>666</b> in the Node may or may not convert the financial protocol to another variant as required by the Host. The data continues via the physical facility <b>669</b> and then to the Financial Transaction Host <b>636</b> that implements a protocol stack <b>674</b> comprising a physical layer <b>670</b>, TCP/IP layer <b>671</b>, a financial transaction protocol <b>672</b>, and a POS application.</p>
    <p num="p-0084">In this architecture, the two POS applications <b>651</b>, <b>673</b> communicate in a client-server fashion, as does the value added services protocol layer <b>658</b> in the Terminal Adapter with the value added services protocol layer <b>663</b> in the Value Added Service Node <b>25</b>. This type of modeling of protocol layers is well known in the art and indicates information that is transparently conveyed by a lower layer that provides services to the higher layers. The value added services layer typically is in communication with an internal management application executing in the Terminal Adapter and communicating with the NOC (not shown). This allows the value added services layer to respond to actions and events outside the direct scope of the value added services protocol itself.</p>
    <p num="p-0085">For example, one service provided by the value added services layer <b>658</b> is data reliability. The management process in the Terminal Adapter detects a failure in the primary communication path from the backend of the Terminal Adapter. The failure detected on the backend of the primary network interface can be any type of failure in the Ethernet physical layer <b>660</b> (assuming Ethernet access for the primary communication path), the TCP/IP layer <b>659</b>, the added services layer <b>658</b>, or the PPP layer <b>666</b> (assuming dial-up access is used for the primary communication path). For example, a physical cut in the Ethernet would result in a loss of electrical signals at the physical layer <b>660</b>. A physical cable cut would also result in a failure at the TCP/IP layer <b>659</b>, since no frames could be transmitted. Other failures could be solely at the TCP/IP layer, such as the failure to resolve an address request (e.g., URL), or failure to receive a response at the TCP/IP level. A failure at the added services layer <b>658</b> could occur if there was a catastrophic failure of the Services Node <b>25</b>, which would leave the lower layers functional from the Terminal Adapter's perspective. For whatever reason a failure is detected, the management process, directs the value added services layer <b>658</b> to establish secondary communication, redirects any subsequently received terminal transaction requests to the secondary communication path, and resumes the transaction processing. During a failure on the primary communication path, the Terminal Adapter returns an error to the terminal (which depends on the terminal interface). Typically, the terminal reattempts initiating the transactions and the Terminal Adapter typically has established the secondary communication path by this time.</p>
    <p num="p-0086">Another service provided by the Terminal Adapter's value added services layer <b>658</b> in conjunction with the Value Added Services Node <b>25</b> may be service discovery and transaction synchronization. Service discovery allows the Terminal Adapter to obtain addresses used to then discover the locations of the appropriate host to which transactions are directed. In this embodiment, an address and port location is provided to address transactions, but other addressing information could be used in other implementations. In conventional systems, the Card Reader <b>2</b> is typically programmed with a telephone number establishing a direct connection to a host. Thus, each terminal is programmed with a destination address of the Host. In the present system, the Terminal Adapter determines the appropriate Host to relay the financial transaction information based on information provided by the Network <b>33</b>. Further services may include security features that involve a Terminal Adapter to first synchronize using a transaction counter prior to communication of transactions. Further, the Terminal Adapter may identify itself using a unique programmed identification number to the Network <b>33</b>. Finally, the Terminal Adapter may authenticate itself using a Message Digest. These activities ensure that Network is communicating with a known, trusted entity in a coordinated manner.</p>
    <p num="p-0087">The Terminal Adapter may also provide some value added functions separate from the data transfer capabilities of the value added service layer. These can be viewed as management oriented functions and augment the functionality of the Terminal Adapter. For example, automatic configuration of the transaction protocol used by the card reader <b>2</b> allows a variety of terminals to interface with the Terminal Adapter. The card readers <b>2</b> are typically programmed with a pre-defined credit card authorization protocol, such as Visa-II, and rely on the recipient (typically the host, via the PSTN) to know, a priori, which protocol is used. The Terminal Adapter <b>14</b> can work with a variety of terminals and is programmed to automatically detect and determine which financial protocol to use and the address to which the transaction is to be directed. Thus, the auto configuration capability provides a versatile Terminal Adapter.</p>
    <p num="p-0088">Finally, the value added services layer in conjunction with the management application handles the downloading of new software and parameters. This ensures that when new value added network services are deployed requiring a corresponding enhancement in the software in the Terminal Adapter, this can be accomplished without having to physically replace the Terminal Adapter, replace an EPROM chip, or otherwise require manual intervention. This function allows the Network to remotely write parameters to the Terminal Adapter and maintain status information as well.</p>
    <p num="h-0008">Hardware Overview</p>
    <p num="p-0089">One embodiment of the principles of the current invention is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, which discloses the hardware configuration of the Terminal Adapter <b>14</b>. The Terminal Adapter is comprised of various readily available integrated circuits. Turning to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the Terminal Adapter <b>700</b> comprises a ‘front end’ <b>706</b>, which refers to the terminal interfaces and users inputs/outputs, as well as a ‘back end’ <b>708</b>, which refers to the network interfaces.</p>
    <p num="p-0090">The Terminal Adapter uses a microprocessor <b>702</b> as the main controller. Although the embodiment discloses a microprocessor, other variations such as single chip microcomputers or programmable controllers could be used. The microprocessor uses an Input/Output bus to control the various ‘front end’ interfaces. These may include a series of LED indicators <b>710</b> that indicates the overall status of the Terminal Adapter, network interface status, and terminal interface status. Alternatively, LCD or other types of displays or visual indicators may be used to reflect the status, using, for example, text or icons. The status indicators indicate whether the primary or secondary network interface is currently in use, modem carriers status, and other diagnostic related indicators.</p>
    <p num="p-0091">The Console RS-232 interface <b>712</b> allows a local terminal to connect to the Terminal Adapter and facilitates programming the Terminal Adapter, indicating configuration changes, performing management functions, etc. The four POTS interfaces <b>714</b> are used to interface to the terminals using a standard RJ-11 telephone connector.</p>
    <p num="p-0092">The microprocessor I/O bus also communicates with the network interfaces <b>708</b>. This typically is the same I/O bus as used for communicating with the terminal interfaces, but it is represented as two separate busses for clarity. The network interfaces may comprise an Ethernet Interface <b>724</b>, which uses a standard 10BaseT protocol, and this is used to convey the primary communication path. The Terminal Adapter may also incorporate another POTS interface <b>722</b> for conveying the secondary communication path as a backup network interface. In one embodiment, the Ethernet interface <b>724</b> may be optional as the telephone interface <b>722</b> may be used for conveying both the primary and secondary communication paths. Regardless of the configuration, the network interface provides connectivity for both the primary and secondary communication paths.</p>
    <p num="p-0093">The microprocessor <b>702</b> also communicates with memory in the form of RAM <b>716</b>, ROM <b>718</b>, and non-volatile RAM <b>720</b> (e.g., ‘flash memory’). In other embodiments, the ROM and limited RAM could be integrated in the microprocessor as commonly embodied with single chip microcomputers.</p>
    <p num="p-0094">Finally, a power supply <b>704</b> is present and this may incorporate a battery backup for saving data in the case of a temporary power outage. A watchdog timer <b>726</b> may be incorporated for resetting the Terminal Adapter in case of a lockup. A Manual Reset push button <b>728</b> provides another form for resetting the Terminal Adapter.</p>
    <p num="h-0009">Software Overview</p>
    <p num="p-0095">The software components associated with the hardware components are illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The software architecture of the system <b>800</b> involves a real-time operating system <b>802</b> interacting with a TCP/IP protocol stack <b>804</b>, value added services <b>832</b> and a transaction protocol handler, which in this embodiment, comprises the VISA terminal interface <b>844</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0096">The TCP/IP stack comprises various well-known protocol handlers, such as PPPoE (point-to-point protocol over Ethernet) <b>806</b>, PPP (point-to-point protocol) <b>808</b>, and DHCP (dynamic host configuration protocol) <b>810</b>. In addition, the IP (Internet protocol), ICMP (Internet control message protocol), and DNS (domain name server) protocols <b>812</b> are present, as well as the UDP/TCP (user datagram protocol/transmission control protocol) <b>814</b>, and the 802.3 Ethernet drivers <b>818</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0097">The TCP/IP stack <b>804</b> interacts with the Network Interface Card <b>826</b> that is the primary network interface using the Ethernet transceiver <b>828</b> that connects to an RJ-45 connector <b>830</b>. The TCP/IP stack <b>804</b> also interacts with the secondary network interact <b>820</b> that incorporates a modem driver <b>822</b> connected to an RJ-11 connector <b>824</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0098">The Real Time Operating System <b>802</b> also interacts with various Value Added Services <b>832</b> that may be implemented via modules for conveying payload data <b>836</b>, encrypting data <b>834</b>, exchanging security keys <b>838</b>, downloading software <b>840</b>, and effecting service discovery <b>842</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0099">Finally, the Real Time Operating System <b>802</b> also interacts with the Terminal Interface <b>844</b> comprising the software modules for a financial protocol handler <b>846</b>, character handler <b>848</b>, and modem handler <b>850</b>. The Terminal Interface <b>844</b> then interacts with a POS interface <b>852</b> that multiplexes and formats the data to a modem standard <b>854</b> to one of the four RJ-11 connectors <b>856</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0100"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> illustrate the principles of the current invention as embodied in a Terminal Adapter, but other embodiments exist. As previously indicated, the Terminal Adapter <b>14</b> is involved with communication with the Network <b>33</b>, specifically the Nodes <b>25</b> or in other cases, indirectly with the NOC. Thus, the Nodes embody the inventive principles as well. The Nodes can be computer servers with large amounts of memory, parallel processing, and hundreds of I/O ports and operating using a variety of operating systems, including UNIX, Linux, and Windows. The associated hardware and software structure may vary from that disclosed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0101">Another embodiment is a variation of the Terminal Adapter <b>14</b> based on a personal computer. While the Terminal Adapter embodied in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> is a special purpose computer equipped with special purpose application software, a general-purpose personal computer could have software installed for accomplishing the same functions. Personal computers frequently incorporate many of the hardware and software components illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> and commonly incorporate a modem and/or an Ethernet Network Interface Card (NIC) for providing Internet access. The personal computer would similarly implement PPPoE or DHCP for Internet access over the Ethernet, and PPP over a dial-up connection to an ISP using the modem. Further, many of the software capabilities (e.g., the TCP/IP stack and modem interfaces) are already present in Internet enabled personal computers. These frequently use a Microsoft Windows™ operating system, providing a well-known software platform for software development. Although a PC is a common embodiment for the Terminal Adapter functions, other embodiments are possible, such as installing the software in a minicomputer, or a server associated with a client-server implementation, where the server utilizes other operating systems, such as UNIX™ or LINUX™.</p>
    <p num="p-0102">Another embodiment is possible where the personal computer is configured solely with a modem and dial-up capabilities, without Internet access. In this case, the connectivity from the personal computer uses a telephone line for both the primary and secondary communication means, but a different ISP is used and/or Client Node may be involved when dialing a secondary telephone number.</p>
    <p num="p-0103">The software for such an embodiment may be loaded into the memory of the personal computer, including downloading the software from a web site on the Internet or uploading the application from a removable media (e.g., floppy disk, tape, CD, etc.).</p>
    <p num="p-0104">In yet another embodiment, an API (application programming interface) library is provided allowing a third party to develop a system incorporating the value added functions according to the principles of the present invention. In this instance, the capabilities of the application are defined by the developer and loaded for execution on the PC.</p>
    <p num="p-0105">The flexibility of the above embodiments is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> with respect to how various value added functions can be developed. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, two embodiments illustrate how PC currently can access the Internet via an Ethernet and/or a dial-up connection. Specifically, in Alternative 1 <b>900</b>, the PC is executing a POS application <b>902</b> that uses the services of the Operation System <b>904</b>. The Operating System may be any of the common operating systems found on PCs. In turn, the Operating System <b>904</b> uses devices drivers to interact with hardware interfaces. One device driver <b>906</b> allows interaction with a modem <b>910</b> that connects to a telephone line <b>916</b> as is well known in the art. The other device driver <b>908</b> interacts with a Network Interface Card (NIC) that is connected to an Ethernet <b>914</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0106">An alternative embodiment is illustrated in Alternative 2 <b>920</b> that similarly incorporates a POS application <b>902</b>, Operating System <b>904</b>, and device drivers <b>924</b>, <b>926</b>. However, these device drivers interact with interfaces on the PC. Specifically, one device driver <b>924</b> interacts with a serial RS-232 interface connected to a modem <b>930</b>. The other device driver <b>926</b> interacts with a USB (Universal Serial Bus) connected to a NIC <b>928</b>. In this embodiment, the hardware for interacting with the Ethernet and telephone line are external to the PC and connect via well know serial interfaces.</p>
    <p num="p-0107">These systems can be readily adapted by loading appropriate software (i.e., a “softmodem”) to incorporate some of the functionality of the Terminal Adapter. This allows the hardware of an existing PC configuration to be adapted to interact with the Network to receive the value added services. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, one embodiment is illustrated whereby the modem and NIC are integrated into the PC (corresponding to Alternative 1 <b>900</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>).</p>
    <p num="p-0108">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, the PC <b>900</b> still incorporates the same POS application <b>902</b> and Operating System <b>904</b>. Minimal changes, if any, are required to use the software enhancement <b>956</b>. Once the softmodem <b>956</b> is loaded, it creates a virtual serial port that receives and sends data to the POS application and Operating System. In essence, the POS application sends data to the software as if it were another serial interface as illustrated via logical path <b>950</b>. The softmodem recognizes various modem commands and data, and after processing, uses the Operating System to interact with the device drivers. Specifically, the softmodem interacts via a logical path <b>952</b> with the device driver <b>906</b> connected to the internal modem <b>910</b> and interacts via a logical path <b>954</b> with the device driver <b>908</b> connected to the NIC <b>912</b>. The modem <b>910</b> and NIC <b>912</b> are connected to a telephone line <b>916</b> and Ethernet <b>914</b> respectively. In this manner, the softmodem can use the NIC <b>912</b> for conveying a primary communication path using the Ethernet and the modem <b>910</b> for conveying a secondary communication path using the telephone line.</p>
    <p num="p-0109">An alternative embodiment utilizing a softmodem is feasible even if the PC only has an integrated modem, without a NIC accessing an Ethernet. Similar to the Terminal Adapter having only a telephone interface as a network connection, the PC softmodem can still initiate a secondary communication path using the modem to dial a second telephone number. One advantage of this embodiment is that value added services of the Network can be gained by adapting existing PCs without requiring additional hardware. Some of the above value added services are now examined in detail as they pertain to the Terminal Adapter embodiment. As indicated above, the principles of the present inventions are not limited to the Terminal Adapter embodiment.</p>
    <p num="h-0010">Secondary Communication Path</p>
    <p num="p-0110">The switch from the primary communication path to a secondary communication path is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Specifically, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a flowchart depicting detecting an error associated with the primary communication path, switching to a secondary communication path, and restoring the primary communication path upon determination that the primary communication path is functioning.</p>
    <p num="p-0111">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the process starts at step <b>1000</b>. The Terminal Adapter is processing transactions normally using the primary communication path associated with the Ethernet based network interface at step <b>1002</b>. The system monitors for failures, errors, or anomalies associated with the primary communication path at step <b>1004</b>. The errors may be of different types. For example, an error could occur at the financial transaction protocol level <b>1006</b> as a result of incorrect structure or data. The error could be based at the TCP/IP level <b>1008</b> as a result of a failure to receive a response to a message. The error could be based on a physical layer error <b>1010</b> as a result of a cut cable. Obviously, a cut cable may trigger errors at other layers. For whatever reason the data cannot be reliably transmitted, the system flow controls the terminals <b>1012</b> while it determines whether the secondary communication path is configured <b>1014</b>. If not, then no further action can be taken <b>1018</b>. However, under normal conditions, there will be configuration data in the parameter file to configure the secondary communication path. The system retrieves the data, including the telephone number <b>1016</b> and originates a secondary communication path using the PPP protocol over a dial-up telephone connection <b>1020</b>. Once established, the terminal transaction processing can resume <b>1022</b>. The system also indicates the communication path status via the front panel LEDs <b>1024</b> indicating the secondary communication path is active.</p>
    <p num="p-0112">The sending of transactions using the secondary communication path is accomplished by altering the routing table for the IP address used to send the transaction. In normal operation, the Terminal Adapter routes the IP address to send a transaction over the primary communication path using the Ethernet network interface (in the embodiment where there are two network interfaces) using the PPPoE or DHCP protocol. Rerouting is accomplished by ‘pointing’ an IP address to the secondary communication path using the telephone based network interface and the PPP protocol.</p>
    <p num="p-0113">The system periodically monitors the condition that triggered the switchover at step <b>1026</b>. This typically involves sending a ‘probe’ message over the primary communication path using the Ethernet based network interface. The system has more than one IP address that it obtained via service discovery. While one address is used for transaction processing, the other is used to probe the primary connection. The probe is accomplished by setting up internal TCP/IP tables (ARP and routes) so that probe messages destined for an address not currently used for transaction processing are routed to the primary (Ethernet) interface.</p>
    <p num="p-0114">Based on the response or lack thereof from a probe message, the Terminal Adapter may determine that transaction processing should continue at step <b>1022</b> using the secondary communication path. If however at step <b>1026</b>, it is determined that the primary communication path has been restored and is reliable, the transactions are moved to the primary communication path at step <b>1028</b> by ‘repointing’ the IP address to route the data over the Ethernet based network interface. The secondary communication path using the telephone connection can then be terminated <b>1030</b> and the probe messaging can be terminated.</p>
    <p num="p-0115">In this manner, the Terminal Adapter can provide reliable, redundant transaction processing when a failure occurs associated with the primary communication path.</p>
    <p num="p-0116"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates the protocol structure when the Terminal Adapter is using the secondary communication path. The communication between the card reader and the Terminal Adapter is not directly impacted. Thus, the protocol stack in the card reader <b>1170</b> interacts with the peer protocol stack in the Terminal Adapter <b>1175</b> in the same manner as normal operation (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Similarly, the interaction of the peer protocol stacks in the Node <b>1187</b> and the Financial Transaction Processor Host <b>1189</b> is the same. The main difference during use of the secondary communication path is in the communication between the back end of the Terminal Adaptor and the Value Added Client/Services Node (specifically, the left protocol stack of the Node representing the Client Node in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>).</p>
    <p num="p-0117">When the Terminal Adapter receives a message from a terminal, the message is passed down through the value added services layer <b>1177</b> via the TCP/IP layer <b>1178</b>, but now uses a PPP connection over a telephone layer <b>1179</b>. Because the secondary communication path is a telephone (dial-up) connection <b>1180</b>, PPP is used since it is a common method of conveying TCP/IP over a dial-up connection. The telephone connection interacts with the telephone network to complete the call to an ISP. The telephone network and ISP are shown as a combined entity <b>1181</b>, though those skilled in the art will realize that there is a conversion at some point from a physical telephone connection <b>1180</b> to another type of physical connection <b>1182</b>. This conversion is performed transparently to the Node, and the only requirement is that the physical layer <b>1183</b> in the Node corresponds to the protocol used by the Internet provider <b>1181</b>. Once the message is in the Node, the information flows up from the physical layer <b>1183</b> to the TCP/IP layer <b>1184</b>, but in this case the PPP protocol is not likely to be used, since it is not likely that a dial-up connection is used between the Node and the Internet. The added services layer <b>1185</b> ensures that transactions are seamlessly continued using the secondary communication path using the aforementioned security, authentication, and encryption procedures. The data is relayed to the financial transaction protocol layer <b>1186</b> where it continues on its way to the Host.</p>
    <p num="p-0118">In this situation, the Services Node (again represented as a combined Client/Service Node) may be a physically different node than used in conjunction with the primary communication. Further, the Client Node may detect the existence of a new connection and notify the NOC of the situation. In this manner, the NOC is able to detect when a given Terminal Adapter is operating in backup mode. Additionally, different or additional Core Nodes may be used to route the Transaction to the Host.</p>
    <p num="p-0119">At this point, the Terminal Adapter indicates the change in status of the primary communication path operation via LEDs or other form of visual indications. LEDs are one embodiment for providing users with a visual indication of the status of the primary and/or secondary communication path. The terminal also updates a status indication associated with each communication path. This status indication may be used by the Terminal Adapter to direct transactions to the primary or secondary communication path.</p>
    <p num="p-0120">During the time in which the secondary communication path is utilized the Terminal Adapter is also sending ‘probe’ messages over the primary communication path to determine whether the connection is available. The criteria used to determine whether it is available may vary. For example, the Terminal Adapter may have an error counter within a moving window for determining that the primary communication path is unacceptable for conveying transactions. In this situation, the probe messages may result in responses that are monitored for errors. Alternatively, the error causing the switchover may be a total lack of operation on the primary path and any response to a probe message may indicate that the primary communication path is available. Once the primary path is restored, the Terminal Adapter communicates the transaction using the primary communication path and the secondary path is terminated. The change in status is reflected in the LEDs and internal tables as appropriate.</p>
    <p num="p-0121">In some installations, the Terminal Adapter may access the Network with the primary communication path associated with a dial-up network connection. In this case, there is still a form of secondary communication path, but this relies on a dial-up connection using the same telephone line, but to a different telephone number. In this circumstance, the secondary communication path does not provide communication when certain faults occur (e.g., a cut telephone line). However, faults frequently occur in the ISP and are more likely than a failure of the telephone line or telephone network. In this situation, an alternative dial-up connection can be established to an alternative access point of the same ISP or to an alternative ISP. In this manner, when the Terminal Adapter dials a second back up telephone number, it bypasses the original fault. This could result in an alternative Client Node serving the Terminal Adapter. Another embodiment involves the Terminal Adapter establishing a direct dial-up connection to the Client Node.</p>
    <p num="p-0122">When dial-up is used for both primary and secondary communication paths (i.e., the primary and second communication paths use a common network interface), the Terminal Adapter is unable to determine when the primary communication path is restored. This is because the ‘probe’ messages cannot be sent out, since the phone line is dedicated for backup access.</p>
    <p num="p-0123">The NOC becomes aware when the Terminal Adapter is operating using the secondary communication path, and monitors the various conditions, including the event causing switchover on behalf of the Terminal Adapter. For example, if a link between the ISP and Client Node fails, the Terminal would switch to the secondary communication path, bypassing the failed link. The NOC is aware of the link failure, and when the link is restored, the NOC directs the Terminal Adapter to terminate the secondary communication path and reinitiate communication using the primary communication path. There are a variety of techniques for effecting NOC to Terminal Adapter communication and one approach involves using the capabilities of downloading new configuration parameters and code discussed herein.</p>
    <p num="h-0011">Automatic Protocol Configuration</p>
    <p num="p-0124"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> illustrates one embodiment of the Terminal Adapter determining the appropriate protocol to use for a given terminal and the host to which the transaction should be sent. Terminals may use a variety of protocols, but typically use an industry standard or proprietary protocol for card authorizations. Common industry protocols include VISA-I and VISA-II for card readers and ATM machines, as well as internationally recognized protocols, such as ISO 8583.</p>
    <p num="p-0125">At a high level, two techniques are generally relevant to determining the terminal protocol, the appropriate transaction type message, and the service name (address) associated with the transaction. These techniques are parsing and telephone number mapping. How these are used, depend in part, on the Host capabilities. Specifically, some Hosts may only recognize simple transaction types. In this case, each terminal accessing that Host is presumed to only require simple transaction type messages. Consequently, every message is mapped to a simple transaction message once the destination host is determined. Other Hosts may recognize and require both simple and session transactions. In this case, the Terminal Adapter must select the appropriate transaction request message when conveying a terminal transaction. Since most transactions are of the simple type, the Terminal Adapter in some instances presumes simple transactions are used, unless exception processing indicates a session transaction should be used.</p>
    <p num="p-0126">In one embodiment, the Terminal Adapter and Host only sends/accepts simple transactions. The Terminal Adapter only has to recognize the protocol type (e.g., VISA-I or VISA-II) and the destination Host. One method for the Terminal Adapter to determine the protocol used by the Terminal is based on the telephone number dialed by the terminal. For example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, the card reader <b>2</b> is programmed to dial a defined number. The Terminal Adapter processes the dialed number using table <b>1290</b>. Table <b>1290</b> contains a column <b>1291</b> for each defined telephone number, a column for the associated protocol type <b>1224</b> and a column for the appropriate service name <b>1293</b>. In this example, a geographical area may be served by two host processors as identified by the names ‘fubar.1’ and ‘fubar.2’. Each service name can be associated with either the VISA-I or the VISA-II protocol. Thus, there are four telephone numbers <b>1294</b>, <b>1295</b>, <b>1296</b>, <b>1297</b> that are entered into the table; one for every combination. For example, dialing 404-555-1235 <b>1295</b> will result in the Terminal Adapter using the VISA-2 protocol and addressing the request to the ‘fubar.1’ host.</p>
    <p num="p-0127">The Terminal Adapter must still parse the message to extract the relevant information and copy this into a simple transaction request message. This message is sent to the Client Node in the Network using routing tables to route the message to a specific Service Node. In this manner, the Terminal Adapter can easily automatically configure itself to use the appropriate protocol and select a host on the dialed number. Once at the Service Node, the transaction is then routed to the appropriate Host.</p>
    <p num="p-0128">Another method wherein the Terminal Adapter determines the appropriate Terminal protocol is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>. This method is based on defined parsing rules and presumes the terminal and host can send/receive either simple transactions or session transactions. Typically, the vast majority of transactions are simple transactions with only a few instances requiring session transactions. When a terminal establishes a connection with the Terminal Adapter (e.g., dials a telephone number and an active connection is established), the Terminal Adapter <b>14</b> sends an “ENQ” or Enquiry message <b>1298</b> to the Terminal. The Terminal will respond by sending a message <b>1299</b> that includes a predefined ASCII string. Based on the type of protocol implemented in the terminal, the message string will have certain characteristics. For example, the message string will be one of several lengths with certain values at the beginning and/or end. For example, one rule is:</p>
    <p num="h-0012">(STARTS-WITH(“T.”) OR STARTS-WITH(“E.”)) AND LEN(32) AND ENDS-WITH(“98”).</p>
    <p num="p-0129">This rule examines the message from the terminal and determines the starting ASCII character, the length, and the last two characters. If the conditions match, then a table lookup indicates the protocol type, message type, and host address. In this case, the Terminal Adapter maps a message starting with an ASCII “T.” or “E.” that is 32 bytes long and ends with an ASCII “98” to a Session Initiate transaction request message <b>1289</b> using the “fubar.1” service name. This requires the Terminal Adapter to implement more sophisticated parsing rules to recognize every type of message for every type of protocol that can be received. One approach to simplify the parsing rules is to presume every terminal message maps to a simple transaction type unless the format indicates otherwise in some manner. In this case, exception processing can be used to simplify the parsing rules.</p>
    <p num="p-0130"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref> illustrates the processing of the parsing rules of one embodiment in further detail. The process starts in step <b>1220</b> with retrieving the parsing rules <b>1221</b>. There are rules to recognize various messages, and a first rule is selected in step <b>1222</b>. The start of the string is tested for validity <b>1224</b> and if no match, the next rule is applied <b>1225</b> and the process starts over. Otherwise, the end of the string is tested for validity <b>1226</b> and if so, it is tested for a match <b>1227</b>. If no match, then the next rule is applied <b>1225</b> and the process repeats. Otherwise, the length is tested for validity <b>1228</b> and if a match occurs <b>1229</b>, then the message is recognized <b>1231</b> and the process is completed <b>1233</b>, otherwise the next rule is applied <b>1225</b> and the process repeats. If no matches occur or the string is found invalid, and there are no more rules <b>1230</b>, then the message is not recognized <b>1232</b> and an error exists. The parsing for the string is completed at step <b>1233</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0131">While this approach requires a rule for every message, it does offer certain advantages over the telephone mapping approach. Specifically, it does not require administration of different telephone numbers in the card readers in order to direct transactions to different locations. However, using either technique, the Terminal Adapter can automatically recognize a plurality of protocols used by different terminals, and determine the appropriate message type and service host.
</p> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0136">Service Discovery, Parameter and Software Download</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p num="p-0132">The concepts of service discovery, parameter download, and software download are closely related. Service discovery is the process by which the terminal adapter discovers the IP addresses for Nodes that can provide further information, such as the parameter file. Parameter file downloading involves receiving a file containing configuration parameters. A configuration version number describes this file. The software download allows new software to be downloaded into the Terminal Adapter and uses address and other parameters obtained in the parameter file. All three procedures rely on the Terminal Adapter interacting with a Network, but with different degrees of autonomy.</p>
    <p num="p-0133">Downloading parameters or software into the Terminal Adapter facilitates remote correction of software bugs as well as software deployment to interact with new services with the Network. Terminal Adapters can be updated without requiring manual replacement of Terminal Adapters, or manual replacement of a portion of memory chips, such as one or more read-only-memory (ROM) chips in the Terminal Adapters, or manual loading of new software. Updating can be done remotely, at convenient times, with minimal cost and interruption in service. The updating of software is controlled in part by the NOC. The NOC is the portion of the Network that maintains tables associating each Terminal Adapter with its parameters.</p>
    <p num="p-0134">The Terminal Adapter boot software of one embodiment comprises two separate programs referred to as DLM (Download Program Manager) and DLP (Downloaded Program). The Terminal Adapter may be factory programmed with the DLM only, and the DLP may be downloaded from the Network after the Terminal Adapter is installed in the client's premises. The DLP is typically stored in non-volatile memory, but in case of a failure of the non-volatile memory, the hardcoded DLM allows recovery. In addition to the DLM, every Terminal Adapter is generally factory programmed with various parameters to allow it to initially connect to the Network. As previously discussed, these parameters typically include: the Terminal Adapter Identification Number, the secret or private encryption key, and the Configuration Service Name. These parameters (except for the Configuration Service Name) can be superceded by obtaining dynamically obtained values, though doing so does not erase the programmed values. For example, the Terminal Adapter knows that absent a dynamically obtained Service Name stored in non-volatile memory, the default, programmed value is to be used.</p>
    <p num="p-0135">The purpose of the DLM is to download and run the latest version of firmware (DLP) that is stored in non-volatile memory. The basic operation of the DLM of one embodiment is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> and described in the following steps starting from a system reset or initial powering up.</p>
    <p num="p-0136">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, the process begins with powering up the Terminal Adapter <b>1350</b>, which is the same as resetting the unit. Upon the very first time of being powered up, there are no dynamic parameters stored in flash (non-volatile) memory. Thus, only the default programmed values exists. Using the Service Discovery procedure <b>1352</b> and the default Configuration Service Name, the Terminal Adapter obtains at least one TCP/IP address for a Client Node to interact with. In step <b>1353</b>, a TCP connection is established using the Ethernet to access the Network, or using PPP over a dial-up telephone line. The Terminal Adapter is programmed with a default parameter file version (specifically, version zero, indicating a default parameter file is present and signifying that all the parameters are default values). In step <b>1354</b>, the Terminal Adapter fetches the parameter data from the Configuration Server. This is done by the Terminal Adapter (specifically, the DLM) indicating its parameter file version number to the Network, and the Network responding with a more recent version followed by the parameter file. The Network will only send the parameter data if the Terminal Adapter parameter file version is not the same as the version value stored in the server database. In this example, the Network knows that the version sent by the Terminal Adapter (version zero) indicates a default parameter is present in the Terminal Adapter, indicating that no prior parameter downloads have occurred.</p>
    <p num="p-0137">If the Terminal Adapter already has the current version, the Network will return the same parameter file version number. This informs the Terminal Adapter that it has the latest parameter file and reduces unnecessary transmission of network data. If the Terminal Adapter previously had downloaded parameters, but these were corrupted, the parameters can be requested from the server by sending a version number zero in the packet. Any received data is saved to non-volatile flash memory in step <b>1356</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0138">Next, at step <b>1358</b>, the Terminal Adapter of this embodiment (using the DLM) checks the current DLP version indicated in the parameter file and compares it against the version that it is currently executing. It further checks to ensure the data is not corrupted (i.e., free from errors as detected by a cyclic redundancy check or similar mechanism). If present and uncorrupted, the DLM skips to executing the DLP application in step <b>1368</b>, which then completes the process at step <b>1370</b>. If instead, the DLP version is not current, then step <b>1360</b> is performed to obtain the must current version. The Terminal Adapter retrieves an address from the parameter file and connects to the IP address for the purpose of performing a file transfer using FTP at step <b>1360</b>. The Terminal Adapter then downloads the more recent DLP program at step <b>1362</b>. If the download is not correct, at step <b>1364</b>, then it resets itself at step <b>1366</b> and repeats the process. If the download is correct at step <b>1364</b>, then the new DLP program is executed at step <b>1368</b> and the process is completed at step <b>1370</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0139">The DLP program is the main application program running on the Terminal Adapter and performs the financial transaction processing and interworking. It uses the same parameters (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>) as used by the DLM. The DLP can, however, have a different Service Name based on a dynamically obtained value, as the DLM process uses the value hard coded in the firmware. Advantageously, the DLP periodically checks if there is a more current parameter file, and if any parameters have changed or a new DLP is needed, the DLP performs a reset and the process repeats as described above. Thus, the DLM only performs one parameter file fetch, obtains the DLP, and then executes the DLP. The DLP then periodically performs the parameter file fetch. Only if the DLP resets the Terminal Adapter does the DLM execute itself. However, in this case, the DLM will observer that various dynamically assigned parameters are present in flash memory and it will utilize those values over the embedded values, skipping some of the above identified steps.</p>
    <p num="p-0140">Thus, obtaining new parameters and new application code are closely related, but the capability exists to download new parameters without having to download new application code. Once the DLP is executing, it will periodically check with the Network to determine whether it has the most current parameter file version. The Network responds by downloading a new parameter file when a newer parameter version is appropriate. One parameter in the file is an indication of a new DLP, which triggers the DLP to initiate a file transfer. In this manner, the Network can control the loading of new parameters and software.</p>
    <p num="p-0141">The contents of the parameter file of one embodiment are illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>. The first parameter in the file is Configuration Version <b>1300</b>. This value indicates the current parameter file version the Terminal Adapter should have stored in memory. This could incorporate a timestamp to signify the last version obtained. The Terminal Adapter periodically queries the Network as to what is the current version that the Terminal Adapter should be executing. If the Network requires downloading a new parameter file, it returns the current version present in the Terminal Adapter. Otherwise, the NOC returns a more recent parameter file version value as well as the full parameter file. In addition, the NOC can append management commands to control the Terminal Adapter indicating it to reset or switch communication paths.</p>
    <p num="p-0142">The frequency with which the Terminal Adapter checks the Configuration Version <b>1300</b> is determined by the Configuration Fetch Interval <b>1301</b>, typically expressed in seconds. This parameter is set to have the Terminal Adapter check its parameter file version every hour or so, although greater or lesser time intervals may be used. Because the downloading of new code suspends the normal operation of the Terminal Adapter, the Terminal Adapter may forego a periodic download, particularly if there are financial transactions underway. The “Maximum Skip Configuration Register” <b>1302</b> indicates the maximum number of times the Terminal Adapter may skip requesting the current parameter version. This value should not be exceeded by the Terminal Adapter regardless of the number of pending transactions.</p>
    <p num="p-0143">The periodic checking for a new parameter file version also functions as a ‘heartbeat’ indication from the Terminal Adapter to the Network. The Node receiving the parameter file request forwards the indication to the NOC, allowing the NOC to update its status tables for that Terminal Adapter. Thus, the receipt of a parameter file request by a Terminal Adapter indicates to the NOC that the Terminal Adapter is functioning. If the terminal has not requested its current parameter file version and the maximum skip interval is exceeded and has not initiated any transactions, then the NOC knows the Terminal Adapter is not functioning. In such a situation, the NOC can initiate another process, such as issuing a notification to a predefined destination in a predefined manner for that Terminal Adapter. For example, the notification may be an e-mail to a network administrator associated with the business entity operating the Terminal Adapter identifying the malfunctioning Terminal Adapter. Alternatively, the NOC could initiate a page, a pre-recorded telephone call, or send an alarm message to a system, file, terminal or printer in the NOC. In this manner, the NOC can proactively react to a non-functioning Terminal Adapter. Similarly, the Network may also monitor transaction usage, errors, or other conditions and report these to the NOC, which initiates a similar notification.</p>
    <p num="p-0144">If software download is required based on an updated binary image name (DLP version number), the Terminal Adapter will initiate the request using File Transfer Protocol (FTP), a well known means for transferring files over the Internet. The address for making the request is obtained from the parameter file as well as required identification and security information. The FTP information <b>1330</b> comprises a URL, Port number, User Name, and Password.</p>
    <p num="p-0145">The User Name identifies the Terminal Adapter, and an alternative embodiment could use the Terminal Adapter Identification Number. The Password data authenticates the user as being authorized to receive the binary DLP file.</p>
    <p num="p-0146">Since FTP information is transferred without being encrypted using a TCP/IP connection to the Terminal Adapter, other embodiments are disclosed providing greater security. One approach is to communicate a ‘challenge’ based on a random value to the Terminal Adapter. The Terminal Adapter concatenates the challenge value with its secret key and computes a Message Digest 5 value to determine a password. The Terminal Adapter sends this value to the Network that has compared a similar value based on the Network's knowledge of the Terminal Adapter's secret key. If the two values match, the Terminal Adapter is authenticated.</p>
    <p num="p-0147">Another variation to ensure secure file transfer is to use the secure data transfer service of the Network. Specifically, a Session Transaction is used to communicate the file in an encrypted manner. The Terminal Adapter and Network use the same encryption methods as for passing transactions originating from a terminal to a host. Various authentication and encryption schemes can be used to effect the file transfer to an authenticated Terminal Adapter, such as using secure FTP procedures.</p>
    <p num="p-0148">The parameter file of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref> also includes other parameters, including communication parameter information <b>1303</b>, binary file characteristics <b>1304</b>, service discovery information <b>1305</b>, primary communication information <b>1307</b>, and backup communication information <b>1309</b>. The communication parameters <b>1303</b> indicate the type of ‘backend’ interface currently used by the Terminal Adapter (e.g., Ethernet, secondary ISP, etc.). This value is included by the Terminal Adapter with every parameter file fetch request and indicates to the Network the current network interface used by the Terminal Adapter. In this manner, the Network is able to monitor the communication path status of each Terminal Adapter.</p>
    <p num="p-0149">Other information includes the binary image file (DLP program) characteristics <b>1304</b> including the name, size and error checking information that the Terminal Adapter should be currently using. The Service Discovery information <b>1305</b> indicates to the Terminal Adapter where terminal transactions should be directed to, typically in the form of a URL. In turn, the Client Node in the Network maps the host name to a URL, which in turn is resolved using the DNS service into an IP address. In this manner, the actual IP addresses are ‘hidden’ from the Terminal Adapter, allowing Network changes in address to transparently occur. This could be similarly accomplished by providing the Terminal Adapter a URL, but if the terminal indicated a single URL, then all traffic would be routed to that single point of interconnection. Since the Client Node maps the service to a URL, the Client Node may select one of several URLs based on geographic location, load capacity (e.g., transaction processing capacity), or other network management aspects. In this manner, diverse Host processors connected to separate Service Nodes may be used to provide seamless transaction services to the Terminal Adapter. Further, this approach never ‘exposes’ the host network addresses and thus provides added security and flexibility.</p>
    <p num="p-0150">The parameter file also contains primary communication path information <b>1307</b> including the telephone number of the primary ISP and any associated modem commands (this is only required if primary access is via dial-up), identification and password information. Additional control information regarding the PPP settings is included. Similarly, secondary or backup communication path information <b>1309</b> is provided.</p>
    <p num="h-0013">Illustration of Operation</p>
    <p num="p-0151">The overall operation of the system is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, which is one embodiment and illustrates a subset of the elements that may be involved during normal operation.</p>
    <p num="p-0152">A card reader <b>2</b> is plugged into a Terminal Adapter <b>14</b> wherein the Terminal Adapter has access to the Internet <b>26</b> via a primary communication interface <b>16</b>. The Terminal Adapter also has a secondary communication interface <b>22</b> using a POTS telephone line <b>19</b> <i>a </i>connected to the Telephone Network <b>24</b>. The Terminal Adapter is powered on and determines that it does not have a current application program loaded. It examines its default Service Discovery Address information, which is programmed into the Terminal Adapter at time of manufacture, and it uses this information to fetch an updated Service Discovery Address. The Terminal Adapter then uses this information to synchronize and authenticate itself to the Network. After this has occurred, it uses a simple transaction to obtain a dynamically determined service name that it queries to obtain a current parameter file setting. One parameter in the file indicates the current software code that should be present and the Terminal Adapter determines whether it should initiate a file transfer to obtain the current software. It then downloads the information using the FTP address information in the parameter file.</p>
    <p num="p-0153">Once this is accomplished, the Terminal Adapter is prepared to handle terminal transactions. It synchronizes its transaction counter (if required) with the Client Node <b>25</b> <i>a </i>and is authenticated by the Client Node using the aforementioned techniques. The authentication procedures also provide a session token to the Terminal Adapter allowing proper encrypting and decrypting of transactional information. Once completed, the Terminal Adapter is ready to process transactions from the Card Reader <b>2</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0154">In this illustration, upon detecting a card swipe, the Card Reader <b>2</b> initiates a phone call and the Terminal Adapter emulates the necessary telephone signals so that a connection is established between the card reader and Terminal Adapter. From the card reader's perspective, it appears to have established a telephone call. The Terminal Adapter queries the Card Reader using an ENQ (e.g., ASCII ENQ character) message to solicit a response message. Upon receipt of the response message, the Terminal Adapter parses the message and selects the appropriate protocol for interacting with the Card Reader. The Terminal Adapter also selects an appropriate service name that identifies a destination Host processor and transaction type, which is a simple transaction type in this illustration.</p>
    <p num="p-0155">Continuing the illustration, the Terminal Adapter maps the transaction to a simple transaction protocol on an established TCP/IP connection and sends the message to the Client Node <b>25</b> <i>a. </i>The Client Node processes the transaction to ensure that the transaction is allowed, synchronized, authorized, error free, and determines the appropriate Node to which to forward the request to. This decision is based on the host name selected by the Terminal Adapter in the simple transaction protocol. The Client Node selects a route to forward the transaction based on, in part, the service name, link capacity, configuration, and processor loading. Assuming it is forwarded directly to a Service Node <b>25</b> <i>b</i>, the Service Node <b>25</b> <i>b </i>then forwards the transaction to the Financial Transaction Processor <b>36</b> according to the protocol used to interconnect the Host <b>36</b> and the Service Node <b>25</b> <i>b</i>. The Host and Service Node are directly connected via a private line <b>34</b>. The message typically is decrypted prior to communication to the Host. The Host receives the card authorization request, responds, and the response is returned to the Service Node that typically encrypts the information and routes the response back to the Client Node <b>25</b> <i>a, </i>then to the Terminal Adapter <b>14</b>, and then the card reader <b>2</b>. This illustrates some aspects of a normal card authorization procedure.</p>
    <p num="p-0156">Assuming now a failure associated with the Internet access on the primary communication path using the primary network interface <b>16</b> (e.g., the connection has broken), the Terminal Adapter recognizes the failure by various means (e.g., lack of response at TCP/IP layer or loss of electrical signals at the physical layer). The Terminal Adapter retrieves the secondary communication path parameters from its parameter file in non-volatile memory, and initiates a dial-up connection to the ISP using the telephone number as well as appropriate identification and password information. Referencing <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the dial-up connection travels from the telephone line <b>19</b> <i>a </i>through the telephone network <b>24</b> and then via an alternative connection <b>19</b> <i>b </i>to the Client Node <b>25</b> <i>a. </i>The Client Node reached may be the same or different from the one previously associated with the primary communication path. The Terminal Adapter must resynchronize the transaction counter, identify and authenticate itself before proceeding with transaction processing. The Terminal Adapter also updates its internal communication path status table and LED status indicators accordingly. Since the Client Node is aware of the establishment of the secondary communication path, it notifies the NOC 29 of the failure. The NOC then updates its status tables and then notifies the appropriate systems and/or personnel that the primary connection has malfunctioned.</p>
    <p num="p-0157">Periodically, the Terminal Adapter sends a ‘probe’ message over the Ethernet interface using the primary communication path to determine if it is functional. In this illustration, the Terminal Adapter uses an Ethernet access to the Internet in conjunction with the primary communication path and dial-up access to the Internet in conjunction with the secondary communication path. Because separate physical access methods are used, the Terminal Adapter can send a ‘probe’ message to determine whether Internet access using the Ethernet access approach is restored while using the dial-up access for completing transactions.</p>
    <p num="p-0158">This scheme must be modified if a single telephone line is used to establish a first connection using a first telephone number for the primary communication path and a second connection using a second telephone number for the secondary communication path. That is because the primary communication path cannot convey a probe message while the telephone line is used to support the secondary communication line. Of course, more sophisticated telephony services such as ISDN allow two connections to exist on one telephone line, as do other telephony based services. Typically, only one communication path can be operational using a single telephone line and the NOC will indicate in response to a parameter file version request that the problem causing the primary communication path to be inoperable has been corrected and that the Terminal Adapter should switch back to using the primary communication path.</p>
    <p num="p-0159">If a response is received on the primary communication path access using the Ethernet, this indicates the communication path is restored. The Terminal Adapter switches back to conveying transactions on the primary connection. Of course, prior to conveying transaction requests, the Terminal Adapter must first synchronize and authenticate itself on the primary communication path. Correspondingly, the NOC is aware of when the switchback occurs. The Terminal Adapter also updates its communication status visually using LEDs, in order to facilitate local diagnosing of communication status. The Terminal Adapter updates its operational status tables regarding the primary and secondary communication paths.</p>
    <p num="p-0160">Periodically, the Terminal Adapter <b>14</b> requests from the Client Node <b>25</b> <i>a </i>what parameter file version it should be executing. This is accomplished using a simple transaction request message that includes the Terminal Adapter's identification number and communication path status. The Client Node forwards this message to the NOC. As a result, the NOC is now aware of the operational status of the Terminal Adapter. The NOC responds to the Client Node with a parameter file version number, and the Client Node forwards the parameter file version number to the Terminal Adapter. Assuming that the version number in the response matches the version number in the Terminal Adapter, the Terminal Adapter continues operating normally. If the NOC responded with a newer version number, it would indicate that at least one parameter in the file had changes and would send the parameter file as well. The Terminal Adapter would examine the parameter file, and if the DLP binary image name was different, the Terminal Adapter would fetch the current software, load it, and then execute it.</p>
    <p num="p-0161">In this manner, the Terminal Adapter is able to automatically interconnect a variety of Terminal Types, which may implement various protocols based on the destination host. The Terminal Adapter in conjunction with the Network ensures a reliable and secure communication capability is provided between the Terminal and Host. Should the primary communication path fail, the Terminal Adapter uses a secondary communication path, and automatically restores the primary communication path when available. The NOC is aware of the operational status of each Terminal Adapter, and provides alarm notifications as appropriate. Further, by the Client Node mapping the service name associated with transaction requests to a particular Service Node, the Network is able to route traffic to a selected Host based on various conditions. In this manner, the Terminal Adapter operating in conjunction with the Nodes <b>25</b> is able to provide a versatile and flexible transaction oriented network service.</p>
