    <p>This application is a Continuation of PCT/JP97/03505 filed Oct. 1, 1997.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention relates to an air conditioner for a vehicle, which is used in a vehicle having, as a power source for driving the vehicle, an engine or both an engine and an electric motor.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading> <p>In recent years, a hybrid car has been proposed in which an electric motor which electrically produces driving force is provided in addition to an engine which produces driving force by combusting fuel such as gasoline. In this hybrid car, even if the engine is stopped, the electric motor is driven by electric power supplied from a battery, which has been previously charged or which is charged by power generated by the engine during traveling, so as to drive the hybrid car.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, even in an air conditioner provided in this type of hybrid car, it is necessary that a compressor be driven when air-conditioning the vehicle interior. For this reason, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 6-286459, the engine is started by operating a switch of an air conditioner when the engine is stopped, and a compressor is driven by the driving force of the engine.</p>
    <p>As a result, a motor used only for driving a compressor of an air conditioner becomes unnecessary, and the air conditioner can be operated without using the driving force of an electric motor or the electric power of a battery to operate the electric motor.</p>
    <p>However, in the above-described structure, it is necessary that the engine be started when operating the air conditioner. As a result, there exist drawbacks in that the driving force of the engine is used only for driving the compressor, which results in deterioration in fuel consumption, and the efficiency of utilization of power is also extremely low.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, in view of the above-described circumstances, an object of the present invention is to provide an air conditioner for a vehicle, which allows air conditioning by efficiently utilizing the driving force of an engine or the driving force of an engine and an electric motor without providing driving means used only for driving a compressor.</p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention is an air conditioner for a hybrid car, which is provided in a hybrid car equipped with an engine and an electric motor for running and which air conditions a vehicle interior by a refrigerating cycle formed to include a compressor and an evaporator and also by circulation of engine cooling water to heat dissipation means for heating, comprising: heat exchange means provided in the refrigerating cycle to cool water; heat storage means in which one of cooling heat of water cooled by said heat exchange means and heating heat of water heated by cooling the engine is accumulated; heat dissipation means for cooling, which cools air to be blown out into the vehicle interior by water to be supplied, as a refrigerant, from said heat storage means; a first circulating passage which circulates, to said heat storage means, engine cooling water circulated between the engine and said heat dissipation means for heating; a second circulating passage which circulates water, serving as a refrigerant, between said heat storage means, said heat dissipation means for cooling, and said heat exchange means; and switching means in which one of said first and second circulating passages is selected by switching and one of heat storage and heat dissipation for said heat storage means is carried out by water circulated through one of said first and second circulating passages.</p>
    <p>As a result, when the engine is driven during cooling, the compressor is driven by the driving force of the engine to allow cooling. At this time, water is cooled by the refrigerating cycle and cooling heat of the water is accumulated in the heat storage means. Subsequently, while the engine is stopped or when the vehicle is being run by the driving of an electric motor, water is circulated from the heat storage means to the heat dissipation means for cooling so as to allow cooling of the air to be blown out into a vehicle interior.</p>
    <p>Further, during heating, cooling water heated by the engine when being driven is used to allow heating, and the heat of the cooling water is accumulated in the heat storage means. Further, when the engine is stopped, water is circulated from the heat storage means to the heat dissipation means for heating so as to allow heating of the air to be blown out into the vehicle interior.</p>
    <p>The switching means effects switching between storage of cooling heat and storage of heating heat by the heat storage means.</p>
    <p>As a result, it is possible to heat and cool the vehicle interior without driving the compressor and it is not necessary that the engine be started to drive the compressor. For this reason, deterioration of fuel consumption can be prevented. Further, driving means such as a motor for driving the compressor while the engine is stopped becomes unnecessary.</p>
    <p>By providing both the water cooling cycle and the water heating cycle, heating and cooling can be carried out according to a vehicle occupant's preference. Further, it is also possible to heat the vehicle interior while carrying out dehumidification, without operating the compressor.</p>
    <p>The determination as to whether the heat storage means is used as a heat source for heating or a heat source for cooling may be made in accordance with the operating state of the air conditioner or environmental conditions such as the outside air temperature, the vehicle-interior temperature, and the like. For example, when the cooling operation is carried out by the air conditioner, there is a high possibility of the cooling operation being continuously carried out. For this reason, the operation may be switched to the second circulating means so that the heat storage means serves as the heat source for cooling. Further, when the outside air temperature is low in the winter or the like, there is a high possibility the heating operation will be carried out, and therefore, the first circulating means may be used to allow the circulation of water (engine cooling water), serving as a refrigerant, to the heat storage means.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, not only the heat storage means, but the heat dissipation means for heating and the heat dissipation means for cooling may be used in common with each other. In this case, during heat storage, only the circulating means needs to be switched between heating and cooling, and at the time of heat dissipation (heating or cooling), water serving as a refrigerant only needs to be supplied from the heat storage means to the heat dissipation means. As a result, heating or cooling can be carried out in accordance with the heat accumulated in the heat storage means. Accordingly, the structures of the water cooling cycle and the water heating cycle can be simplified.</p>
    <p>Further, the present invention is an air conditioner for a hybrid car, which is provided in a hybrid car equipped with an engine and an electric motor for running and which air conditions a vehicle interior by a refrigerating cycle formed to include a compressor and an evaporator, comprising: driving shafts provided respectively in the engine and in the electric motor; an output shaft connected to the driving shafts of the engine and the electric motor and rotated synchronously with a driving source which is one of the engine and the electric motor; load reduction means for reducing the driving load of said output shaft which rotates integrally with the driving shaft of the engine when the electric motor is driven; and driving force transmitting means which connects said output shaft and the driving shaft of the compressor to transmit the driving force of said output shaft to the compressor.</p>
    <p>According to the above-described structure, when the electric motor is driven, a load for rotating the driving shaft of the engine connected to the output shaft of the electric motor is reduced by the driving load reduction means and the compressor is driven by remaining power.</p>
    <p>In the present invention as described above, the above-described load reduction means is valve opening means for opening a valve while the engine is stopped.</p>
    <p>Generally, when the driving shaft of the engine in a stopped state is rotated, air within a cylinder of the engine must be compressed, and therefore, a driving load is extremely high. Accordingly, in order to rotate the driving shaft of the engine, an extremely large driving force is required. On the other hand, so long as the driving load reduction means operates so as to, for example, open a valve which allows air supply and exhaust for a cylinder of the engine or open a throttle valve which opens and closes a passage of air to be supplied into the cylinder of the engine, compression of air within the cylinder of the engine or increase in air-intake resistance can be prevented, thereby allowing reduction of a load for rotating the driving shaft.</p>
    <p>As described above, so long as the load for rotating the output shaft when the engine is stopped is reduced by the driving load reduction means, the compressor can be driven by using the driving force of the electric motor. In this case, in the same way as the aforementioned, it is not necessary to provide driving means used only for driving the compressor and it is also not necessary to start the engine to drive the compressor. For this reason, consumption of fuel caused by driving the engine can be restrained.</p>
    <p>Moreover, the present invention is an air conditioner for a hybrid car, which is provided in a hybrid car equipped with an engine and an electric motor for running and which air conditions a vehicle interior by a refrigerating cycle formed to include a compressor and an evaporator, comprising: an auxiliary-machine motor which drives a plurality of auxiliary machines provided in the hybrid car; second driving force transmitting means which can transmit the driving force of the engine and the driving force of said auxiliary-machine motor to the plurality of auxiliary machines and also to the driving shaft of the compressor; driving force interrupting means which separates the driving shaft of the engine and said second driving force transmitting means from each other; and control means which separates the driving shaft of the engine and said second driving force transmitting means from each other by said driving force interrupting means when the engine is stopped and allows the plurality of auxiliary machines including the compressor to be driven by said auxiliary-machine motor.</p>
    <p>As a result, when the engine is driven, the driving force of the engine is transmitted by the second driving force transmitting means to auxiliary machines including the compressor. Further, when the engine has been stopped, the driving shaft of the engine and the second driving force transmitting means are separated from each other by the driving force interrupting means and the compressor is driven by the driving force of the auxiliary-machine motor.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, when the engine is stopped, the compressor can be driven by the auxiliary-machine motor in the same way as in other auxiliary machines provided in the hybrid car, and when the engine is being driven, the auxiliary machines including the compressor can be driven by the driving force of the engine.</p>

    <heading>BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading> <p>An air conditioner for a vehicle according to the present invention will be hereinafter described in detail with reference to the attached drawings.</p>
    <p>(First Embodiment)</p>
    <p>FIG. 1 shows a schematic structure of an air conditioner for a vehicle (hereinafter referred to as “air conditioner <b>10</b>”) applied to a first embodiment. FIG. 2 schematically shows a portion of a hybrid car <b>12</b>, which is an example of a vehicle equipped with the air conditioner <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 2, the hybrid car <b>12</b> equipped with the air conditioner <b>10</b> includes, as a power source for traveling, an electric motor <b>16</b> in addition to an engine <b>14</b>. The electric motor <b>16</b> and the engine <b>14</b> are each connected to an output shaft <b>18</b> directly or indirectly. In FIG. 2, as an example, the output shaft <b>18</b> is connected to the electric motor <b>16</b> so that a driving shaft of the electric motor <b>16</b> becomes the output shaft <b>18</b>, and a driving shaft <b>14</b>A of the engine <b>14</b> is connected to the output shaft <b>18</b>. As a result, the output shaft <b>18</b> is driven to rotate by the engine <b>14</b> or the electric motor <b>16</b>. The electric motor <b>16</b> is driven by electric power supplied from, for example, a previously charged battery (not shown) mounted before traveling.</p>
    <p>The hybrid car <b>12</b> is provided with the compressor <b>20</b> disposed adjacent to the engine <b>14</b>. A pulley <b>22</b> is mounted to a driving shaft <b>20</b>A of the compressor <b>20</b> and an endless V belt <b>26</b> is entrained between the pulley <b>22</b> and a pulley <b>24</b> mounted to the driving shaft <b>14</b>A of the engine <b>14</b>. When the engine <b>14</b> is started, driving force is transmitted via the V belt <b>26</b> to the compressor <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 1, in the air conditioner <b>10</b>, a refrigerating cycle is formed by a circulating passage of a refrigerant including the compressor <b>20</b>, a capacitor <b>28</b>, and an evaporator <b>30</b>. A refrigerant liquefied by being compressed by the compressor <b>20</b> is supplied to the evaporator <b>30</b>, and when the refrigerant is decompressed to be vaporized, air to be blown out into a vehicle interior is cooled.</p>
    <p>The pressure of the refrigerant supplied to the evaporator <b>30</b> is adjusted by controlling the capacity of the compressor <b>20</b>. Further, water in the cooled air is applied to the evaporator <b>30</b> by dew condensation, and in the air conditioner <b>10</b>, not only at the time of a cooling operation, but also at the time of a heating operation, a dehumidifying operation can be effected by operating the compressor <b>20</b> at a predetermined capacity.</p>
    <p>The evaporator <b>30</b> is provided within an air-conditioning duct <b>32</b>. The air-conditioning duct <b>32</b> is provided with blower fans <b>34</b>. Outside air or air within a vehicle interior is sucked into the air-conditioning duct <b>32</b> and is blown toward the evaporator <b>30</b>, and the blown air is cooled by the evaporator <b>30</b> which is cooled by the circulating refrigerant, thereby allowing dehumidification.</p>
    <p>The air-conditioning duct <b>32</b> is provided with a heat-regenerative radiator (hereinafter referred to as “radiator <b>36</b>”) and a heater core <b>38</b>, which are disposed adjacent to the evaporator <b>30</b>. Air passing through the evaporator <b>30</b> further passes through the radiator <b>36</b> and the heater core <b>38</b> and is blown out from a blowout hole (not shown) into the vehicle interior.</p>
    <p>A pair of hot-water pipes <b>40</b>A and <b>40</b>B are connected to the heater core <b>38</b> between the engine <b>14</b> and the heater core <b>38</b>. An electrically operated pump <b>42</b> is provided at an intermediate portion of one hot-water pipe <b>40</b>A. Driving the electrically operated pump <b>42</b> allows cooling water for the engine <b>14</b> to be supplied to the heater core <b>38</b>. The heater core <b>38</b> heats air passing through the heater core <b>38</b> with the cooling water serving as a refrigerant (the cooling water will be hereinafter referred to as “water refrigerant”).</p>
    <p>The other hot-water pipe <b>40</b>B connected to the heater core <b>38</b> is branched off by a pair of branch pipes <b>44</b>A and <b>44</b>B. These branch pipes <b>44</b>A, <b>44</b>B are respectively provided with passage switching valves <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> in a pair. A heat storage tank <b>50</b> is connected to and between these passage switching valves <b>46</b> and <b>48</b>. With the heat storage tank <b>50</b> communicating with the hot-water pipe <b>40</b>B via the branch pipes <b>44</b>A and <b>44</b>B due to the operation of the passage switching valves <b>46</b> and <b>48</b>, a water refrigerant circulated while being heated by the engine <b>14</b> is supplied to the heat storage tank <b>50</b>.</p>
    <p>The heat storage tank <b>50</b> is filled with a heat accumulating material surrounded by a heat insulating material. With the water refrigerant circulated between the heat storage tank <b>50</b> and the engine <b>14</b> passing through the heat storage tank <b>50</b>, the heat accumulating material is heated by the water refrigerant. The heat storage tank <b>50</b> is maintained with the temperature of the heat accumulating material being kept by the heat insulating material. Further, when, while the engine <b>14</b> is stopped, the electrically operated pump <b>42</b> is operated to allow the water refrigerant to be supplied to the heat core <b>38</b> to pass through the heat storage tank <b>50</b>, the water refrigerant is heated due to heat exchange effected between the water refrigerant and the heat accumulating material. As a result, a water heating cycle is formed in which, even when the engine <b>14</b> is in a stopped state, air passing through the heater core <b>38</b> is heated to allow the vehicle interior to be heated.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, a water-refrigerant heat exchanger <b>52</b> is mounted between the evaporator <b>30</b> and the compressor <b>20</b>, which form the refrigerating cycle. The water-refrigerant heat exchanger <b>52</b> is cooled in such a manner that a refrigerant passing through the evaporator <b>30</b> is supplied to the water-refrigerant heat exchanger <b>52</b> and is further decompressed.</p>
    <p>A pair of cold-water pipes <b>54</b>A and <b>54</b>B are connected to the radiator <b>36</b>. One cold-water pipe <b>54</b>B is connected to the water-refrigerant heat exchanger <b>52</b>. The other cold-water pipe <b>54</b>B is connected to the passage switching valve <b>48</b> and an electrically operated pump <b>56</b> is mounted at an intermediate portion of the other cold-water pipe <b>54</b>B. Further, the water-refrigerant heat exchanger <b>52</b> is connected to the passage switching valve <b>46</b> by a cold-water pipe <b>54</b>C. When the passage is switched to the heat storage tank <b>50</b> by the passage switching valves <b>46</b> and <b>48</b>, a circulating passage for circulating the water refrigerant between the heat storage tank <b>50</b>, the water-refrigerant heat exchanger <b>52</b>, and the radiator <b>36</b> is formed.</p>
    <p>As a result, when the electrically operated pump <b>56</b> is operated to allow circulation of the water refrigerant, and the water refrigerant passes through the water-refrigerant heat exchanger <b>52</b>, the cooled water refrigerant is supplied to the heat storage tank <b>50</b>. The heat storage tank <b>50</b> allows the heat accumulating material to be cooled when the water refrigerant passes through the heat storage tank <b>50</b>. Further, when the water refrigerant passing through the heat storage tank <b>50</b> is supplied to the radiator <b>36</b> by the operation of the electrically operated pump <b>56</b>, the water refrigerant is cooled by the heat accumulating material within the heat storage tank <b>50</b>. As a result, a water cooling cycle is formed in such a manner that the water refrigerant cooled in the heat storage tank <b>50</b> is supplied to the radiator <b>36</b> and air within the air-conditioning duct <b>32</b>, passing through the radiator <b>36</b>, is cooled.</p>
    <p>The air conditioner <b>10</b> includes an air-conditioner ECU <b>60</b> which controls air conditioning. The air-conditioner ECU <b>60</b> has a general structure in which, by controlling each operation of the compressor <b>20</b>, the blower fans <b>34</b>, and the like in accordance with an operating state of an unillustrated operation panel (setting of an operating condition) while detecting the outside air temperature, the indoor air temperature, and the like, air for a cooling/heating operation or a dehumidifying operation is blown out into the vehicle interior and the vehicle interior is thereby maintained in a desired air-conditioned state. Detailed illustration and description of the structure of the air-conditioner ECU <b>60</b> will be omitted.</p>
    <p>The air conditioner <b>10</b> also includes a water-refrigerant control circuit <b>62</b>. The water-refrigerant control circuit <b>62</b> is connected to the air-conditioner ECU <b>60</b> and also to an engine ECU (not shown) for controlling the engine <b>14</b>. Further, the passage switching valves <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> and the electrically operated pumps <b>42</b> and <b>56</b> are each connected to the water-refrigerant control circuit <b>62</b>.</p>
    <p>Signals corresponding to an operating state of the air conditioner <b>10</b> and environmental conditions such as the outside air temperature, the indoor air temperature, and the like are inputted from the air-conditioner ECU <b>60</b> to the water-refrigerant control circuit <b>62</b>. Further, a signal which indicates an operating state of the engine <b>14</b> is inputted from the engine ECU. The water-refrigerant control circuit <b>62</b> controls the passage switching valves <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> and the electrically operated pumps <b>42</b> and <b>56</b> based on the various signals.</p>
    <p>Next, the operation of the first embodiment will be described with reference to the flow charts shown in FIGS. 3 and 4. These flow charts each show an example of the operation of the water-refrigerant control circuit <b>62</b>.</p>
    <p>The flow chart shown in FIG. 3 shows an example of heat storage processing for the heat storage tank <b>50</b>. In the first step <b>100</b>, it is ascertained whether the engine <b>14</b> has been started (switched on), i.e., whether the hybrid car <b>12</b> is traveling using the engine <b>14</b>. When it is determined that the engine <b>14</b> has been started, the process proceeds to step <b>102</b>. In step <b>102</b>, it is ascertained whether the air conditioner <b>10</b> is switched on.</p>
    <p>When the air conditioner <b>10</b> is switched on (when the decision of step <b>102</b> is affirmative), the process proceeds to step <b>104</b>, in which it is ascertained whether the air conditioner <b>10</b> is operating in a cooling mode or a heating mode. Further, when the air conditioner <b>10</b> is not switched on (when the decision of step <b>102</b> is negative), the process proceeds to step <b>106</b>, in which environmental conditions such as the outside air temperature are measured. In step <b>108</b>, it is determined from the measured environmental conditions such as the outside air temperature whether the possibility is of the air conditioner <b>10</b> being operated in a cooling mode or in a heating mode. For example, in the summer period in which the outside air temperature or the indoor temperature is high, there is a high possibility of the air conditioner <b>10</b> being operated in a cooling mode. In the winter period in which the outside air temperature or the indoor temperature is low, there is a high possibility of the air conditioner <b>10</b> being operated in a heating mode. Consequently, it can be determined whether the possibility is of the air conditioner <b>10</b> being operated in a cooling mode or in a heating mode from a determination about whether the outside air temperature or the indoor temperature exceeds a previously set value.</p>
    <p>As described above, when the air conditioner <b>10</b> is operated in the cooling mode (when the decision of step <b>104</b> is affirmative) or when there is a possibility of the air conditioner <b>10</b> being operated in the cooling mode (when the decision of step <b>108</b> is affirmative), the process proceeds to step <b>110</b>, in which, by operating the passage switching valves <b>46</b> and <b>48</b>, the heat storage tank <b>50</b> is connected to the cold-water pipes <b>54</b>B and <b>54</b>C and the electrically operated pump <b>56</b> is operated. As a result, circulation of the water refrigerant between the water-refrigerant heat exchanger <b>52</b> and the heat storage tank <b>50</b> is started.</p>
    <p>When the engine <b>14</b> has been started, the driving force of the engine <b>14</b> is transmitted via the V belt <b>26</b> to the compressor <b>20</b> and the driving shaft <b>20</b>A of the compressor <b>20</b> is thereby rotated. As a result, the refrigerant compressed and discharged from the compressor <b>20</b> is supplied to the water-refrigerant heat exchanger <b>36</b> and the water refrigerant circulated in the water- refrigerant heat exchanger <b>36</b> is cooled. The water refrigerant cooled by the water-refrigerant heat exchanger <b>36</b> is transferred to the heat storage tank <b>50</b> to cool the heat accumulating material within the heat storage tank <b>50</b>. As a result, heat for a cooling operation is stored in the heat storage tank <b>50</b>.</p>
    <p>When the air conditioner <b>10</b> is operated in the heating mode (when the decision of step <b>104</b> is negative) or when there is a possibility of the air conditioner <b>10</b> being operated in the heating mode (when the decision of step <b>108</b> is negative), the process proceeds to step <b>112</b>, in which by operating the passage switching valves <b>46</b> and <b>48</b>, the heat storage tank <b>50</b> is connected to the branch pipes <b>44</b>A and <b>44</b>B branched off from the hot-water pipe <b>40</b>B and the electrically operated pump <b>42</b> is operated. As a result, circulation of the water refrigerant heated by the engine <b>14</b> is started and the heated water refrigerant is supplied from the engine <b>14</b> to the heat storage tank <b>50</b>. When the water refrigerant placed in a high-temperature state by cooling the engine <b>14</b> passes through the heat storage tank <b>50</b> from the engine, the heat accumulating material in the heat storage tank <b>50</b> is heated to allow storage of heat for the heating operation.</p>
    <p>The heat storage operation in the heat storage tank <b>50</b> is continuously carried out until it is determined that the engine <b>14</b> has been stopped in step <b>114</b> or in step <b>116</b>. When the engine <b>14</b> is stopped, in step <b>118</b>, the passage switching valves <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> may be closed to prevent outflow of the water refrigerant from the heat storage tank <b>50</b>, and the like. Further, the time of completion of the heat storage operation in the heat storage tank <b>50</b> may be set, for example, for when the temperature of the heat accumulating material in the heat storage tank <b>50</b>, which is detected by a temperature sensor or the like, reaches a predetermined temperature, or when the change in the temperature is reduced to nothing.</p>
    <p>FIG. 4 shows an example in which the heat storage tank <b>50</b> is used as a heat source for heating or air-cooling. In the first step <b>120</b> in this flow chart, it is ascertained whether the air conditioner <b>10</b> is switched on. Further, in the subsequent step <b>122</b>, it is ascertained whether the engine <b>14</b> is started (switched on).</p>
    <p>When the engine <b>14</b> is started, a normal air-conditioning operation is allowed in which the heat of cooling water for the engine <b>14</b> and the compressor <b>20</b> to be driven by the engine <b>14</b> are used. Accordingly, when the decision of step <b>122</b> is affirmative, the process proceeds to step <b>124</b>, in which the normal operation of the air conditioner <b>10</b> is started.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, when the air conditioner <b>10</b> is switched on (when the decision of step <b>120</b> is affirmative) and when the engine <b>14</b> is in a stopped state (when the decision of step <b>122</b> is negative), the process proceeds to step <b>126</b>, in which it is ascertained whether the air conditioner <b>10</b> can be operated with the heat storage tank <b>50</b> serving as the heat source. When the operation mode of the air conditioner <b>10</b> and heat stored in the heat storage tank <b>50</b> coincide with each other, namely, when the air conditioner <b>10</b> is set in a cooling mode in a state in which heat for air-cooling is stored in the heat storage tank <b>50</b> and when the air conditioner <b>10</b> is set in a heating mode in a state in which heat for heating is stored in the heat storage tank <b>50</b>, the decision of step <b>126</b> is made affirmative, and the process proceeds to step <b>128</b>.</p>
    <p>When the air conditioner <b>10</b> is set in the heating mode and the heat source for heating is provided in the heat storage tank <b>50</b>, the decision of step <b>128</b> is made negative and the process proceeds to step <b>130</b>. As a result, the passage switching valves <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> are operated to allow connection between the heat storage tank <b>50</b> and each of the branch pipes <b>44</b>A and <b>44</b>B, and further, the electrically operated pump <b>42</b> is actuated to start circulation of the water refrigerant between the heat storage tank <b>50</b> and the heater core <b>38</b>. The circulated water refrigerant is heated by the heat accumulating material as it passes through the heat storage tank <b>50</b> and is transferred to the heater core <b>38</b>. The water refrigerant transferred to the heater core <b>38</b> heats air which passes through the heater core <b>38</b> within the air-conditioning duct <b>32</b>. As a result, heated air is blown out from the air-conditioning duct <b>32</b> to allow the vehicle interior to be heated.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, when the air conditioner <b>10</b> is set in the cooling mode, the decision of step <b>128</b> is affirmative and the process proceeds to step <b>132</b>. As a result, the passage switching valves <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> allow connection between the heat storage tank <b>50</b> and each of the cold-water pipes <b>54</b>B and <b>54</b>C, and further, the electrically operated pump <b>56</b> is actuated to start circulation of the water refrigerant between the heat storage tank <b>50</b> and the radiator <b>36</b>. The water refrigerant transferred from the heat storage tank <b>50</b> to the radiator <b>36</b> due to the operation of the electrically operated pump <b>56</b> is cooled by the heat accumulating material in the heat storage tank <b>50</b> as it passes through the heat storage tank <b>50</b> and is further transferred to the radiator <b>36</b>. The water refrigerant supplied to the radiator <b>36</b> allows the cooling of air passing through the radiator <b>36</b>. As a result, air cooled by the radiator <b>36</b> is blown out into the vehicle interior and air-cooling for the vehicle interior is achieved.</p>
    <p>The cooling or heating operation using the heat storage tank <b>50</b> is continuously carried out based on the confirmation that the air conditioner <b>10</b> was switched on in step <b>134</b> or in step <b>136</b>. When the air conditioner <b>10</b> is switched off, the process proceeds to step <b>138</b>, in which the process ends by the electrically operated pump <b>42</b> or the electrically operated pump <b>56</b> being stopped. When the flow chart is being executed, the water-refrigerant control circuit <b>62</b> monitors to determine whether the engine <b>14</b> has been started. When the engine <b>14</b> is started, heating and air-cooling with the heat storage tank <b>50</b> used as the heat source is stopped and the heat storage operation in the heat storage tank <b>50</b> is started again.</p>
    <p>As described above, the air conditioner <b>10</b> is constructed in such a manner that, when the engine <b>14</b> is started, heat for air conditioning is stored in the heat storage tank <b>50</b>, and when the air conditioner <b>10</b> is operated in the state in which the engine <b>14</b> has been stopped, cooling or heating for the vehicle interior is effected by the heat stored in the heat storage tank <b>50</b>. For this reason, even when the engine <b>14</b> is stopped, the vehicle interior is able to be air-conditioned. Further, it is not necessary to provide a power source used only for operating the compressor <b>20</b> which effects air conditioning for the vehicle interior when the engine <b>14</b> is in a stopped state, and there is no possibility of the electrically operated motor <b>16</b> being actuated to operate the compressor <b>20</b>. For this reason, no extra large load is applied to the battery.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, in the first embodiment, heat for cooling or heating is stored in the heat storage tank <b>50</b> by switching the circulating passage of the water refrigerant for the heat storage tank <b>50</b> by the passage switching valves <b>46</b> and <b>48</b>. However, separate heat storage tanks may be respectively provided for the heating and cooling operations. As a result, either of the cooling and heating operations can be selected irrespective of environmental conditions and the like, so as to allow air conditioning (cooling and heating) according to a vehicle occupant's preference.</p>
    <p>Further, the heat storage tank <b>50</b> is not limited to a structure which stores heat in the heat accumulating material. For example, a structure in which a heated or cooled water refrigerant is stored and the stored water refrigerant is released as occasion demands may be used. Further, there can also be used other various structures which each allow efficient heat storage and heat dissipation.</p>
    <p>In the first embodiment, there was described a structure in which the water-refrigerant control circuit <b>62</b> is provided separately from the air-conditioner ECU <b>60</b>, but the air-conditioner <b>60</b> may be provided to serve as the water-refrigerant control circuit <b>62</b>.</p>
    <p>(Second Embodiment)</p>
    <p>Next, a second embodiment of the present invention will be described.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 5, an air conditioner <b>72</b> applied to the fourth embodiment allows heating by using heat of the engine <b>14</b> when the engine <b>14</b> is driven. Further, when the engine <b>14</b> is stopped, heating can be effected by using heat of the engine <b>14</b> stored in the heat storage tank <b>66</b> when the electrically operated pump <b>42</b> is actuated to drive the engine <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p>Further, the compressor <b>20</b> of the air conditioner <b>72</b> is rotated due to the driving force from the output shaft <b>18</b> to which the engine <b>14</b> and the electric motor <b>16</b> are each connected.</p>
    <p>An engine ECU <b>74</b> which controls the operation of the engine <b>14</b> is connected to the air-conditioner ECU <b>60</b>. The engine ECU <b>74</b> is generally structured to operate based on a conventional publicly-known engine control method to control the engine <b>14</b>. In the present embodiment, only the structure relating to the present invention will be described herein.</p>
    <p>A throttle valve <b>76</b> and a fuel injector <b>78</b> are each connected to the engine ECU <b>74</b>. The throttle valve <b>76</b> is operated in accordance with an operation of an accelerator pedal (not shown) and the fuel injector <b>78</b> is actuated in accordance with the opening of the throttle valve <b>76</b> and the operating state of the engine <b>14</b>. As a result, the proper amounts of both air and fuel are supplied to each cylinder of the engine <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p>The engine <b>14</b> is provided with valve opening means <b>84</b> which opens an intake valve <b>80</b> and an exhaust valve <b>82</b>. The valve opening means <b>84</b> is connected to the engine ECU <b>74</b>, and based on an operation signal from the engine ECU <b>74</b>, the valve opening means <b>84</b> opens the intake valve <b>80</b> and the exhaust valve <b>82</b>.</p>
    <p>Generally, when the intake valve <b>80</b> and the exhaust valve <b>82</b> are opened and the throttle valve <b>76</b> is brought into a full-open state, the intake/exhaust resistance when the piston is moving reciprocally in a cylinder is reduced in the engine <b>14</b>. As a result, the friction for rotating the driving shaft <b>14</b>A when the engine <b>14</b> is in a stopped state is reduced and the driving shaft <b>14</b>A of the engine <b>14</b> can be rotated by a small driving force.</p>
    <p>In the air conditioner <b>72</b> structured as described above, when the engine <b>14</b> is stopped at the time of the cooling or dehumidifying operation, and the cooling or dehumidifying operation is indicated while the electric motor <b>16</b> is being driven (cooling or dehumidification is set by an unillustrated operation panel), a valve opening signal is outputted to the engine ECU <b>74</b>. When the valve opening signal is inputted to the engine ECU <b>74</b>, the throttle valve <b>76</b> is brought into a full-open state and the intake valve <b>80</b> and the exhaust valve <b>82</b> are opened. At this time, the injection of fuel from the fuel injector <b>78</b> is, of course, prohibited. Further, the opening of the throttle valve <b>76</b>, the intake valve <b>80</b>, and the exhaust valve <b>82</b> may be carried out not only at the time of the operation of the air conditioner <b>72</b>, but also when the engine <b>14</b> is stopped or the electric motor <b>16</b> is being driven.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, the air conditioner <b>72</b> is operated in such a manner that the compressor <b>20</b> is rotated by the driving force of the electric motor <b>16</b>. At this time, no large friction for rotating the driving shaft <b>14</b>A of the engine <b>14</b> is applied to the electric motor <b>16</b>, and therefore, the compressor <b>20</b> can be driven.</p>
    <p>As described above, in the second embodiment as well, it is not necessary that the engine <b>14</b> be actuated when the air conditioner <b>72</b> is operated, thereby preventing deterioration of fuel consumption caused by starting the engine <b>14</b>. Further, it is also not necessary to provide driving means used only for driving the compressor <b>20</b> in a state in which the engine <b>14</b> is stopped, and therefore, there is no need of an increase in parts for operating the air conditioner <b>72</b>.</p>
    <p>Further, as a method for reducing the load of the electric motor <b>16</b>, there may be considered a method in which a clutch is provided between the driving shaft of the electric motor <b>16</b> and the driving shaft of the engine <b>14</b> to interrupt a large torque. However, the provision of such special parts is not necessary.</p>
    <p>(Third Embodiment)</p>
    <p>The method for driving the compressor <b>20</b> without starting the engine <b>14</b> while the engine <b>14</b> is stopped is not limited to the above-described first and second embodiments. A third embodiment will be hereinafter described with reference to FIG. <b>6</b>.</p>
    <p>Even in the case of a hybrid car, provision of a plurality of auxiliary machines such as a power steering pump is required, and even when the engine <b>14</b> has been stopped, it is necessary to drive these auxiliary machines. As shown in FIG. 6, the compressor <b>20</b> of the air conditioner <b>86</b> is, together with an alternator <b>88</b> and a power steering pump <b>90</b>, driven by the driving force of an auxiliary machine motor <b>92</b>.</p>
    <p>Namely, a V belt <b>94</b> is entrained between a pulley <b>92</b>A mounted to a driving shaft of the auxiliary machine motor <b>92</b>, a pulley <b>88</b>A mounted to a driving shaft of the alternator <b>88</b>, a pulley <b>90</b>A mounted to a driving shaft of the power steering pump, and a pulley <b>22</b> of the compressor <b>20</b>, and the compressor <b>20</b> is rotated by the driving force of the auxiliary machine motor <b>92</b>.</p>
    <p>In the above-described structure as well, even when the engine <b>14</b> has been stopped, the compressor <b>20</b> can be driven without starting the engine <b>14</b>. Further, a plurality of auxiliary machines are driven concurrently without providing driving means used only for driving the compressor <b>20</b>, and therefore, it is not necessary to provide separate driving means for driving not only the compressor <b>20</b> but also the auxiliary machines.</p>
    <p>Further, the alternator <b>88</b> is driven by the auxiliary machine motor <b>92</b> so as to allow the generation of a voltage different from that of the electric power for driving the electric motor <b>16</b>. Usually, the working voltage of the electric motor <b>16</b> is set at a high value (for example, about 288V) because the electric motor <b>16</b> requires a large driving force. For this reason, it is necessary that the electric motor <b>16</b> be transformed to a suitable voltage (for example, 12V) using a DC/DC converter or the like so as to operate devices such as the air-conditioner ECU <b>60</b> and the like. On the other hand, electric power of this voltage (12V) can be directly generated by providing the alternator <b>88</b>, and therefore, an effect that an expensive DC/DC converter becomes unnecessary is obtained, and further, reduction in cost of the parts used for a hybrid car can be achieved.</p>
    <p>(Fourth Embodiment)</p>
    <p>Next, an example of an air conditioner for a vehicle using the auxiliary machine motor <b>92</b> will be described, as a fourth embodiment, with reference to FIGS. 7A, <b>7</b>B, and <b>8</b>. It should be noted that the basic structure of the fourth embodiment is the same as that of the above-described third embodiment, and that the same members as those of the third embodiment will be denoted by the same reference numerals, and a description thereof will be omitted.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B, the pulley <b>22</b> is mounted to the driving shaft <b>20</b>A of the compressor <b>20</b> in an air conditioner <b>250</b>. The auxiliary machine motor <b>92</b> is provided in the vicinity of an engine <b>202</b>. A V belt <b>252</b> serving as a second driving force transmitting means is entrained between the pulley <b>92</b>A of the auxiliary machine motor <b>92</b>, the pulley <b>22</b> of the compressor <b>20</b>, and a pulley <b>230</b> mounted to a crank shaft <b>228</b> of the engine <b>202</b>.</p>
    <p>Further, the air conditioner <b>250</b> includes a water pump <b>254</b> mounted to the engine <b>202</b> in place of the electrically operated pump <b>42</b>. When the water pump <b>254</b> is driven, cooling water for the engine <b>202</b> is supplied to the heater core <b>38</b> so as to allow the vehicle interior to be heated.</p>
    <p>The V belt <b>252</b> is also entrained onto a pulley <b>256</b> mounted to a driving shaft <b>254</b>A of the water pump <b>254</b>, and the water pump <b>254</b> can be driven by the driving force of the engine <b>202</b> or the driving force of the auxiliary machine motor <b>92</b>. Meanwhile, other auxiliary machines such as the power steering pump <b>90</b> and the like (not shown in FIG. 7A) are also connected to the auxiliary machine motor <b>92</b>, and when the pulley <b>92</b>A is rotated by the driving force of the engine <b>202</b>, the rotating force is also transmitted to these other auxiliary machines.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, as shown in FIG. 7A, a crank clutch <b>258</b> serving as driving force interruption means is provided in the crank shaft <b>228</b> and a compressor clutch <b>260</b> is provided in the driving shaft <b>20</b>A of the compressor <b>20</b>. The crank clutch <b>258</b> separates the crank shaft <b>228</b> of the engine <b>202</b> and the pulley <b>230</b> from each other enabling the crank shaft <b>228</b> and the pulley <b>230</b> to be relatively rotatable. Further, the compressor clutch <b>260</b> separates the driving shaft <b>20</b>A of the compressor <b>20</b> and the pulley <b>22</b> from each other enabling the driving shaft <b>20</b>A and the pulley <b>22</b> to be relatively rotatable.</p>
    <p>The crank clutch <b>258</b> and the compressor clutch <b>260</b> are each connected to an air-conditioner ECU <b>238</b>, and the auxiliary machine motor <b>92</b> can also be driven by being controlled by the air-conditioner ECU <b>238</b>.</p>
    <p>The air-conditioner ECU <b>238</b> is provided to control the auxiliary machine motor <b>92</b>, the crank clutch <b>258</b>, and the compressor clutch <b>260</b> in accordance with the operating state of the air conditioner <b>250</b> and the operating state of the engine <b>202</b>.</p>
    <p>Next, with reference to the flow chart shown in FIG. 8, the switching of a driving source such as the compressor <b>20</b> when the air conditioner <b>250</b> is operated will be described.</p>
    <p>In the flow chart, first, in step <b>150</b>, it is ascertained whether the engine <b>202</b> is started (switched on). When the engine <b>202</b> is switched on (when the decision of step <b>150</b> is affirmative), the process proceeds to step <b>152</b>, in which the crank clutch <b>258</b> is switched on (is connected) and the auxiliary machine motor <b>92</b> is stopped (is switched off). As a result, the V belt <b>252</b> is driven to rotate by the driving force of the engine <b>202</b> and other auxiliary machines connected to the water pump <b>254</b> or the auxiliary machine motor <b>92</b> are driven by the driving force of the engine <b>202</b>.</p>
    <p>In the subsequent step <b>154</b>, it is ascertained whether the air conditioner <b>250</b> has been switched on, namely, whether the compressor <b>20</b> need to be driven. Here, when the air conditioner <b>250</b> has been switched on and the compressor <b>20</b> needs to be driven (when the decision of step <b>154</b> is affirmative), the process proceeds to step <b>156</b>, in which the compressor clutch <b>260</b> is switched on. As a result, the driving force of the engine <b>202</b> is transmitted to the compressor <b>20</b> and the compressor <b>20</b> is thereby driven by the driving force of the engine <b>202</b>.</p>
    <p>Further, when the air conditioner <b>250</b> has not been switched on, namely, when the compressor <b>20</b> does not need to be driven (when the decision of step <b>154</b> is negative), the process proceeds to step <b>158</b>, in which the compressor clutch <b>260</b> is switched off. As a result, the compressor <b>20</b> is not driven and the water pump <b>254</b> is driven, and therefore, heating is made possible. Further, other auxiliary machines connected to the auxiliary machine motor <b>92</b> are also driven by the driving force of the engine <b>202</b>.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, when the engine <b>202</b> has been stopped (when the decision of step <b>150</b> is negative), the process proceeds to step <b>160</b>, in which the crank clutch <b>258</b> is switched off and the crank shaft <b>228</b> and the pulley <b>230</b> are separated from each other.</p>
    <p>In the subsequent step <b>162</b>, it is ascertained whether the air conditioner <b>250</b> has been switched on. When the air conditioner <b>250</b> has been switched on (when the decision of step <b>162</b> is affirmative), the process proceeds to step <b>164</b>, in which the compressor clutch <b>260</b> is switched on and the auxiliary machine motor <b>92</b> is driven (switched on). As a result, the driving force of the auxiliary machine motor <b>92</b> is transmitted to the compressor <b>20</b> and also to the water pump <b>254</b> and the air conditioner <b>250</b> is operated by the driving force of the auxiliary machine motor <b>92</b>.</p>
    <p>Further, when the air conditioner <b>250</b> has not been switched on (when the decision of step <b>162</b> is negative), the process proceeds to step <b>166</b>, in which the compressor clutch <b>260</b> is switched off. In the subsequent step <b>168</b>, it is ascertained whether the heating operation is being effected, i.e., whether the heating operation is to be effected.</p>
    <p>When the heating operation is effected (when the decision of step <b>168</b> is affirmative), the process proceeds to step <b>170</b>, in which the auxiliary machine motor <b>92</b> is driven. As a result, the driving force of the auxiliary machine motor <b>92</b> is transmitted via the V belt <b>252</b> to the water pump <b>254</b> and cooling water of the engine <b>202</b> is supplied to the heater core <b>38</b>. At this time, the crank clutch <b>258</b> and the compressor clutch <b>260</b> are each switched off, and therefore, there is no possibility of an unnecessary load being applied to the auxiliary machine motor <b>92</b>.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, when the heating for the vehicle interior is not effected (when the decision of step <b>168</b> is negative), the process proceeds to step <b>172</b>, in which the auxiliary machine motor <b>92</b> is left stopped. At this time, if it is necessary to operate other auxiliary machines connected to the auxiliary machine motor <b>92</b>, the auxiliary machine motor <b>92</b> may be operated.</p>
    <p>As described above, in the air conditioner <b>250</b> applied to the fifth embodiment as well, it is not necessary to use a motor used only for driving the compressor <b>20</b> and also not necessary to start the engine <b>202</b>, thereby preventing deterioration of fuel consumption which is caused due to the engine <b>202</b> driving the compressor <b>20</b>. Further, it is not necessary to provide the electrically operated pump <b>42</b> which is used to supply cooling water to the heater core <b>38</b> for the heating operation, and therefore, reduction in the number of parts and reduction in costs can be achieved.</p>
    <p>Further, even if a hybrid car is temporarily stopped by reason of waiting for a traffic light or loading and unloading, and further, the engine <b>202</b> is stopped, air conditioning for the vehicle interior by the auxiliary machine motor <b>92</b> becomes possible.</p>
    <p>In recent years, it has become possible for the engine to be stopped when a vehicle stops temporarily (short-time stopping) from the standpoint of fuel problems or environmental issues. However, even in this case, it is not necessary to stop the air conditioning for the vehicle interior. The same is not limited to the hybrid car, and can also be applied to a general vehicle having no electric motor serving as a driving source for a running operation.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the transmission of driving force to the compressor <b>20</b> and the switching of a driving source are not limited to the aforementioned. For example, as shown in FIG. 7C, with the double pulley clutch <b>206</b> being used in the driving shaft <b>20</b>A of the compressor <b>20</b>, a V belt <b>262</b> may be entrained between the pulley <b>216</b> and the pulley <b>92</b>A of the auxiliary machine motor <b>92</b> and a V belt <b>264</b> may be entrained between the other pulley <b>218</b>, a pulley <b>230</b>, and a pulley <b>256</b>.</p>
    <p>As a result, when the air conditioner <b>250</b> is operated, it suffices that the double pulley clutch <b>206</b> be switched on at the time of operation (including a heating operation) of the air conditioner <b>250</b> using the auxiliary machine motor <b>92</b>. Further, when the air conditioner <b>250</b> is not operated, so long as the double pulley clutch <b>206</b> is switched off, only the other auxiliary machines can be driven by the auxiliary machine motor <b>92</b> as occasion demands.</p>
    <p>Further, in the sixth embodiment, the air-conditioner ECU <b>238</b> is used as the control means. However, the crank clutch <b>258</b>, the compressor clutch <b>260</b>, and the auxiliary machine motor may be each controlled by the engine ECU. Alternatively, a controller used only for these devices may be provided.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, in each embodiment of the present invention, the description given was that for a hybrid car, but the present invention can also be applied to vehicles of various structures, each traveling by the driving force of an engine without using an electric motor. In a vehicle which travels using an engine as a driving source, a so-called economy running system has been proposed in which the engine is stopped when the vehicle stops so as to improve fuel consumption and also inhibit emission of exhaust gas. In the case of using the economy running system, when the engine is stopped, driving of the compressor is also stopped. At this time, when the present invention is applied, the vehicle interior can be maintained in a comfortable air-conditioned state without stopping air conditioning in the vehicle interior.</p>
    <p>In this case, for example, an alternator/starter motor can be used in place of the electric motor. The alternator/starter motor operates as a starter motor at the time of starting the engine, and during the operation of the engine, it operates as an alternator which generates power by the driving force of the engine.</p>
    <p>As a result, when the engine is operated to allow a running operation, air conditioning for the vehicle interior can be carried out by driving the compressor while effecting power generation/charging by the alternator/starter motor.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, when driving of the engine is stopped by stopping the vehicle, the engine and the alternator/starter motor are separated from each other and the alternator/starter motor is driven as the electric motor. As a result, the driving force of the alternator/starter motor is transmitted to the compressor without being transmitted to the engine, thereby allowing air conditioning for the vehicle interior using the compressor.</p>
    <p>As a result, even when the engine <b>14</b> is in a stopped state, air conditioning for the vehicle interior can be effected by driving the compressor <b>20</b>.</p>
    <heading>INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading> <p>The above-described present invention allows air-cooling and heating in which the power of an engine is efficiently utilized. Further, the present invention also allows the driving of a compressor by an electric motor without starting an engine and is useful as an air conditioner not only for a vehicle which travels by the driving force of the engine, but also for a hybrid car which travels by the driving force of the electric motor in addition to that of the engine.</p>
