<heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading> <p num="p-0002">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/682,740, filed May 19, 2005.</p>
<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading> <p num="p-0003">Generally, the present invention relates to a phased array antenna system. Specifically, the present invention pertains to a phased array antenna that provides input protection from transient signals. More specifically, the present invention relates to a phased array antenna system that provides input protection that has sharp limiting characteristics, and a high limiting threshold. Particularly, the present invention pertains to a phased array antenna that isolates an element transmission line or connection line from the antenna element itself. More particularly, the present invention is directed toward a phased array antenna having a phasing circuit configured to maintain a desired phase delay over a wide bandwidth of received signals.</p>
  <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading> <p num="p-0004">Input protection devices commonly found on antennas are configured to prevent unwanted transient signals, such as current spikes, from propagating through the supporting circuitry attached to the output of the antenna. These transient signal spikes may be caused by various phenomena including static electricity, noise, or may result from the presence of a large transmitted signal. However, to attenuate these transients, various limiting systems have been utilized, but suffer from inadequate performance or create unwanted characteristics that impede the antenna's overall performance.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">One such limiting system utilizes a pair of parallel, oppositely connected, signal diodes as a limiting circuit to achieve input protection for the remaining portion of an antenna's supporting circuitry. Because the diodes conduct some amount of current between their on and off states, the system provides “soft” limiting. Furthermore, when the diodes conduct signals that are below the threshold values established by the diodes, unwanted distortion of the received signal generally results. Additionally, if multiple signals are detected by the antenna, intermodulation distortion, or IMD, may occur due to the design of the limiting network. Furthermore, the low voltage threshold of the diodes results in the possibility that a large out-of-band signal may drive the diodes into their limiting region. As a result, IMD may be induced in the desired in-band signals being received by the antenna. To overcome the low voltage threshold, inherent with the parallel diode limiting circuit, several diodes are typically arranged in series in each parallel leg of the limiting circuit, thereby increasing the overall threshold voltage of the limiting system. However, while the threshold voltage of the system is increased, thereby reducing the amount of distortion that may be induced into the system, the limiting characteristics of the system are further degraded or “softened.” As such, there is a trade-off between having high limiting thresholds, and “hard” limiting, with the selection of one characteristic resulting in the degradation of the other.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">Another commonly used limiting circuit which provides input protection for active antennas utilizes series connected zener diodes, with their anodes coupled together, or with their cathodes coupled together. Because zener diodes, when reverse biased, have a threshold voltage much greater than conventional diodes, the limiting network overcomes the problems of low threshold voltage associated with the previously discussed system. However, this limiting network reduces the performance of the antenna to which the limiting network is coupled due to the zener's high capacitance, and slow switching action between the forward biased zener diode's on and off states. Additionally, the capacitance of the zener diode increases greatly in a non-linear manner as the applied voltage from the signal increases, resulting in IMD and other distortion forms being introduced into the antenna network. Also because of the slow switching action between the on and off states of the forward biased zener diode, distortion of a received signal can also result after a transient signal has decayed after being limited by the system.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">Phasing networks or circuits used in conjunction with a phased array antenna system are used to establish a directional receiving pattern. Of primary importance are the location of nulls in the antenna's receiving pattern, and the orientation of the null in a desired direction. As a result, the phase array antenna is insensitive to signals arriving at the antenna in the direction of the null, while the remaining portion of the antenna's receiving pattern continues to be sensitive to transmitted signals. To achieve the delay necessary to create a directional receiving pattern, one or more delay lines, each typically comprising a specific length of coaxial cable of a length corresponding to a desired phase delay are used. However, because these delay lines are frequency dependant, the amount of phase delay provided changes as the signal frequency detected by the antenna array is altered. As such, when it is desired that the antenna system be responsive to signals of a new frequency, the delay provided by the delay lines changes. Thus, the null created in a first direction according to the delay provided by the original delay line is altered because the amount of phase delay provided by the delay line has changed due to the new operating frequency of the antenna system.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">Therefore, there is a need for a limiting circuit for use with an active antenna that provides sharp limiting action to received signals, while having a high limiting threshold characteristic. Additionally, there is a need for a limiting circuit that can be formed from a small number of components to provide reduced cost and manufacture. Furthermore, there is a need for an isolation circuit that provides isolation between the antenna element and any cable, such as an element transmission line, coupled to the output of an antenna unit. There is yet a further need for a phasing circuit for a phased array antenna system that is frequency independent, and that maintains a null in a desired direction over a wide bandwidth of received signals.</p>
  <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0009">It is thus an object of the present invention to provide a phased array antenna system which provides input protection from transient signals.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">It is another object of the present invention to provide a phased array antenna system, as above, which provides sharper limiting to transient signals than prior art phased array antenna systems.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">It is still another object of the present invention to provide a phased array antenna system which provides a desired phase delay over a wide bandwidth of received signals.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">It is still yet another object of the present invention to provide a phased array antenna system that isolates a transmission line from the dipole elements of the antenna system.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">These and other objects of the present invention, as well as the advantages thereof over existing prior art forms, which will become apparent from the description to follow, are accomplished by the improvements hereinafter described and claimed.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">In general, a phased array antenna system generating a directional null includes an antenna array having a plurality of spaced antenna units. The spaced antenna units each receive transmitted signals in a null direction. In addition, a transmission line is provided for each said antenna unit, and is used to couple a phasing circuit to the antenna array so as to receive said transmitted signals from said antenna array. The phasing circuit includes a delay line in at least one of said transmission lines. Coupled to the output of one and another transmission lines is a first combiner. The first combiner is configured to combine the received signals into a first output signal. Coupled to the output of the other two transmission lines is a second combiner that is configured to combine said received signals into a second output signal. A generally frequency independent phase inverter receives the second output signal from the second combiner, where the second output signal is phase shifted by 180 degrees. Furthermore, a third combiner is configured to receive the first output signal from the first combiner and the phase shifted second output signal from the phase inverter. The amount of delay provided by each delay line is configured such that the first and second output signals are cancelled by said third combiner, thereby generating the directional null.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a limiting circuit for a phased array antenna unit includes a capacitor and a zener diode coupled in parallel with the capacitor. A first diode is arranged in series with the parallely arranged zener diode and capacitor. Also in a parallel arrangement with the combination of the zener diode, the capacitor, and the first diode is a second diode.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, an isolation circuit for isolating an antenna of a phased array antenna unit from a feed line includes a transformer. The transformer includes a first winding and a second winding, such that the first winding is adapted to be coupled to the antenna, while the secondary winding is adapted to be coupled to the feed line. Also coupled to the transformer is a network of inductors, each of which are selected so as to provide an impedance that is generally frequency independent.</p>
  <p num="p-0017">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a phased array antenna system generating a directional null includes an antenna array having at least two spaced antenna units each receiving transmitted signals in a null direction. Coupled to each antenna unit is a transmission line that are each coupled to a phasing circuit to receive said transmitted signals from said antenna array. The antenna array includes a delay line in at least one of said transmission lines. Additionally, a phase inverter is coupled to the output of the delay line, wherein the phase inverter is generally frequency independent, and shifts the output of said phase inverter by 180 degrees of phase shift. Coupled to the output of the transmission line lacking a delay line is a combiner that is also coupled to the output of the phase inverter. The phase inverter provides an amount of delay, such that the transmitted signals received by the phasing circuit are cancelled at the output of the combiner, thus generating the directional null.</p>
  <p num="p-0018">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a method for canceling a transmitted signal to generate a directional null includes receiving a transmitted signal at a plurality of antenna units. The signals are received so that each antenna unit receives an individual transmitted signal with a delay corresponding to the relative position of each antenna unit. Next, each of the received signals are delayed by a predetermined amount. Once delayed, the signals are combined into a first group and a second group, wherein the signals of the first and second groups are equal in magnitude and delay. The first group of signals are inverted by 180 degrees of phase shift, wherein the phase shift is independent of the frequency of the signals of the first group. Finally, the inverted first group of signals are combined with the non-inverted second group of signals, whereby the transmitted signal received at the receiving step is cancelled, thus generating the directional null.</p>
  <p num="p-0019">A preferred exemplary phased array antenna system incorporating the concepts of the present invention is shown by way of example in the accompanying drawings without attempting to show all the various forms and modifications in which the invention might be embodied, the invention being measured by the appended claims and not by the details of the specification.</p>

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>PREFERRED EMBODIMENT FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0023">A phased array antenna system is generally designated by the numeral <b>10</b>, as shown in the drawings. Antenna system <b>10</b> includes an active antenna unit <b>11</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which includes a dipole antenna <b>12</b> and resistor <b>13</b> connected between the dipole feed point terminals. Coupled to the output of dipole antenna <b>12</b> is a resonant tuning circuit <b>14</b>. The resonant tuning circuit <b>14</b> contains a plurality of capacitors <b>16</b>, and a plurality of inductors <b>18</b> arranged in parallel. Additionally, a resistor <b>19</b> may also be provided in series with one or more of the parallel inductors <b>18</b>, as shown. The resonant tuning circuit <b>14</b> may be user configurable, via one or more jumpers <b>20</b>, to provide desired tuning to further complement the operating frequency range of the dipole antenna <b>12</b>. However, it should also be appreciated that the resonant circuit <b>14</b> may include a tuning circuit that cannot be adjusted by the user. Coupled to the output of the resonant tuning circuit <b>14</b> is a limiting circuit <b>22</b>. It should be appreciated that the dipole antenna <b>12</b> may be comprised of antenna elements that are short, and therefore have minimal mutual coupling.</p>
  <p num="p-0024">Limiting circuit <b>22</b> provides phased array antenna system <b>10</b> with input protection from electrical transients that may result from various sources, including but not limited to, electro-static discharge (ESD) or high power signals that are received by antenna unit <b>11</b>. Limiting circuit <b>22</b> includes a capacitor <b>24</b> that couples the output of resonant tuning circuit <b>14</b> to legs <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> of the limiting circuit <b>22</b>, which are in a parallel configuration with each other. Leg <b>26</b> includes a diode <b>30</b>, which may be in the form of a fast signal diode, however any other type of suitable diode having fast switching characteristics may be utilized. In series with diode <b>30</b> and coupled to the cathode of diode <b>30</b> is a capacitor <b>32</b> and a zener diode <b>34</b>. Capacitor <b>32</b> and diode <b>34</b> are in parallel with each other, with the cathode of the zener diode <b>34</b> coupled to the cathode of diode <b>30</b>. As a result of the configuration of capacitor <b>32</b> and zener diode <b>34</b>, a voltage source, having a supply voltage equal to the zener voltage of zener diode <b>34</b> is effectively created when a large signal is present. Leg <b>28</b> includes a diode <b>36</b> that may comprise a fast signal diode, however any other type of suitable diode having fast switching characteristics may be utilized. The utilization of fast signal diodes <b>30</b> and <b>36</b>, in combination with zener diode <b>34</b>, provide sharp limiting while simultaneously providing a higher limiting threshold to incoming signals than would be otherwise achievable. It should also be appreciated that the voltage supply embodied by the combination of the zener diode <b>34</b> and capacitor <b>32</b> may also be achieved by other methods, including but not limited to a DC power source or a voltage divider. Finally the output of the limiting circuit <b>22</b> is coupled to a source follower <b>50</b> via a capacitor <b>38</b> and resistor <b>40</b>, which will be hereinafter discussed.</p>
  <p num="p-0025">Briefly, during the operation of the limiting circuit <b>22</b>, after antenna unit <b>11</b> has received an initial number of cycles of a received signal, capacitor <b>32</b> will charge to a predetermined DC voltage. The capacitor <b>32</b>, once charged, holds the zener diode <b>34</b> at its zener voltage during the negative cycles of the received signal. Thus, diode <b>30</b> will not be forward biased until the anode of diode <b>30</b> is greater than the threshold voltage of diode <b>30</b> plus the zener voltage selected for zener diode <b>34</b>. Additionally, if a signal having a magnitude greater than that of the zener voltage of zener diode <b>34</b> is received, the magnitude of such signal is limited to a maximum peak to peak voltage that is equal to that of the zener voltage of zener diode <b>34</b>. Correspondingly, if a signal having a magnitude less than the zener voltage of zener diode <b>34</b> is received, the magnitude of such received signal is not limited, and can freely pass through the limiting circuit <b>22</b> without attenuation. For example, if zener diode <b>34</b> is configured to have a zener voltage of 7V, then a received signal having a peak to peak amplitude of 10V would be limited to a peak to peak voltage of 7V. Alternatively, if zener diode <b>34</b> is configured to have a zener voltage of 7V, then a received signal having a peak to peak amplitude of 5V would not be limited by the limiting circuit <b>22</b>, and would freely pass without attenuation to the source follower <b>50</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0026">Source follower <b>50</b> has a voltage gain of less than unity, and is utilized to transform the high impedance of dipole antenna <b>12</b> to a lower impedance, which is seen by the load that may be coupled to the output of the antenna unit <b>11</b>, such as a receiving unit (not shown) or a phasing circuit <b>200</b>, which will be discussed later. In addition, the source follower <b>50</b> provides a much higher impedance seen by the antenna. Because the impedance of the source follower <b>50</b> seen by dipole antenna <b>12</b> is higher than the impedance of the dipole antenna <b>12</b>, the ability of dipole antenna <b>12</b> to induce current or signals into the following circuitry is facilitated. Additionally, the source follower <b>50</b> serves to provide a stable and fixed impedance to drive an attached load.</p>
  <p num="p-0027">Source follower <b>50</b> includes a transistor <b>52</b> and a transistor <b>54</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, may comprise n-type JFETs (Junction Field Effect Transistors). However, it is also contemplated that p-type JFET transistors may be utilized to comprise transistors <b>52</b> and <b>54</b>. In addition, a single JFET could be used. Also, other types of buffer circuits, such as an emitter follower using a bipolar transistor could be used. The gates of the transistor <b>52</b> and transistor <b>54</b> are coupled to node <b>56</b> where a biasing voltage is established by a resistor <b>58</b>. Transistor <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> are also coupled together via their source and drain connections via nodes <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>. Node <b>62</b> is coupled to node <b>64</b> via a series connected inductor <b>66</b> and resistor <b>68</b>. A resistor <b>70</b> separates node <b>60</b> from node <b>72</b>. A diode <b>74</b> is connected to between node <b>72</b> and a node <b>76</b>, whereby diode <b>74</b> is oriented with its cathode coupled to node <b>72</b> and its anode coupled to node <b>76</b>. Additionally, a diode <b>78</b> is also coupled with its cathode tied to node <b>76</b> and its anode coupled to node <b>64</b>. A capacitor <b>80</b> and a capacitor <b>82</b> that are in a parallel arrangement are tied to node <b>72</b> and to node <b>64</b>. A capacitor <b>86</b> is also used to couple node <b>76</b> to the input of the isolation circuit <b>100</b> which will be discussed later.</p>
  <p num="p-0028">Isolation circuit <b>100</b> is provided to isolate any connection used to couple the antenna unit <b>11</b> to other components. Specifically, isolation circuit <b>100</b> isolates the dipole antenna <b>12</b> from the cables used to connect antenna unit <b>11</b> to another component, such as the phasing circuit <b>200</b>, to be discussed. Additionally, the isolation circuit <b>100</b> ensures that the impedance of the conductors in a cable, such as a coaxial cable, used to couple the antenna unit <b>11</b> to a desired load, have equal impedances to ground. For example, if the impedance to ground for each of the conductors of a cable is not kept equal, a common mode current will be caused to occur on the cable. As a result, the cable will effectively become part of the antenna, thereby altering the physical properties and performance characteristics of the antenna. Because precise balancing of each of the conductors of the feed line are needed for optimal operation of the phased array antenna system <b>10</b>, the isolation circuit <b>100</b> serves to electrically separate the cable from the dipole antenna <b>12</b>. To achieve this isolation, isolation circuit <b>100</b> creates a high impedance path for the common mode current, while simultaneously maintaining the required low impedance to the desired differential signals. The output isolation circuit <b>100</b> is also capable of operating over a wide bandwidth or frequency range.</p>
  <p num="p-0029">Specifically, isolation circuit <b>100</b> includes a transformer <b>102</b> having a winding <b>104</b> and a winding <b>106</b> that are constructed, such that, the capacitive coupling between windings <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> is reduced. It should also be appreciated that the ratio between winding <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> may be 1 to 1 and is configured to provide balancing and isolation for the antenna and any load coupled to the antenna unit <b>11</b>. In one embodiment, transformer <b>102</b> may be configured such that windings <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> are constructed by making windings <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> on a binocular (2 hole) core. In addition, each winding <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> is enclosed in a tube constructed from material sold under the trademark TEFLON. As a result, this embodiment of transformer <b>102</b> allows the capacitance between the windings <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> to be reduced.</p>
  <p num="p-0030">Winding <b>104</b> of transformer <b>102</b> is coupled to capacitor <b>86</b> and to node <b>64</b>, provided in source follower <b>50</b>. Correspondingly, winding <b>106</b> is coupled to a node <b>110</b> and a capacitor <b>112</b> that is tied to a node <b>114</b>. An inductor <b>116</b> is coupled between node <b>64</b> and node <b>114</b>, and serves to isolate dipole antenna <b>12</b> from the output of the isolation circuit <b>100</b>. Another inductor <b>118</b> is also coupled between node <b>72</b> and node <b>110</b>. In addition, the inductance values and inductor types for inductors <b>116</b> and/or <b>118</b>, may be selected such that the shunt reactance of the inductors <b>116</b> and/or <b>118</b> approximately cancels the shunt reactance of transformer <b>102</b> over a wide frequency range. As a result, isolation circuit <b>100</b> achieves a high impedance over a wide frequency range. It should be appreciated that inductors <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> may comprise a choke or other inductor having the characteristics of a high impedance over a wide bandwidth or frequency range. It is also contemplated that isolation circuit <b>100</b> be configured, such that, the amount of capacitive reactance between windings <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> of transformer <b>102</b>, be of a value complementary to the reactance values of inductor <b>116</b> and/or <b>118</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0031">A connector <b>120</b> is provided by the present system <b>10</b> to allow signals passing through the antenna unit <b>11</b> to be transferred from the antenna unit <b>11</b>. Specifically, connector <b>120</b> is a two (2) conductor connector allowing node <b>110</b> and node <b>114</b> of the antenna unit <b>11</b> to be individually connected to an element transmission line <b>202</b>. It should be appreciated that connector <b>120</b> may comprise a coaxial-type connector or other suitable connector type.</p>
  <p num="p-0032">Element transmission line <b>202</b> is used to couple the active antenna <b>11</b> to a phasing circuit <b>200</b>. One end of the element transmission line <b>202</b> is coupled to connector <b>120</b> of antenna unit <b>11</b>, while the other end of element transmission line <b>202</b> is coupled to a connector <b>120</b> provided by the phasing circuit <b>200</b>, which will be hereinafter discussed. The element transmission line <b>202</b> typically comprises a coaxial cable, however any other suitable multi-conductor line may be used.</p>
  <p num="p-0033"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows a block diagram of a phasing circuit <b>200</b> in accordance with the concepts of the present antenna system <b>10</b>. The phasing circuit <b>200</b> is designed to create a directional antenna pattern, especially to generate nulls, or areas in the receiving pattern of an antenna that are not sensitive to transmitted signals. As a result, a directional antenna is created. The phased array antenna of present invention <b>10</b> includes an antenna array <b>201</b> comprising four (4) active antenna units <b>11</b>A, <b>11</b>B, <b>11</b>C, and <b>11</b>D which are coupled to the phasing circuit <b>200</b>, as discussed below. A directional antenna pattern, including directional nulls, is generated by phasing circuit <b>200</b> by delaying each signal received by the individual antenna units <b>11</b>A-D by a predetermined amount. Thus, when each of the four (4) signals received in the null region of the antenna array <b>201</b>, and processed in a manner to be described are combined the signal is effectively cancelled. As such, only signals arriving at the antenna units <b>11</b>A-D in a direction not defined by a null are passed through the phasing circuit <b>200</b> and into an attached load, such as a receiver.</p>
  <p num="p-0034">Phasing circuit <b>200</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is coupled to four (4) antenna units <b>11</b>A-D which are functionally equivalent to antenna unit <b>11</b> discussed with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Furthermore, the following discussion is based on an antenna configuration, wherein antenna array <b>201</b> comprising antenna units <b>11</b>A-D are arranged in a manner shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. In addition, the direction of a signal received (RS) by antenna units <b>11</b>A-D, and the direction of the desired null (ND), all of which are referenced with respect to antenna unit <b>11</b>C, are as indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. As such, the received signal (RS) arriving at antenna unit <b>11</b>C experiences zero (0) signal delay, while antenna units <b>11</b>B and <b>11</b>D experiences a delay of S, and antenna unit <b>11</b>A experiences a delay of 2 S, being the amount of phase delay caused in a received signal due to the physical distance between the antenna units <b>11</b>A-D comprising antenna array <b>201</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0035">Each antenna unit <b>11</b>A-D is coupled to the phasing circuit <b>200</b> via an element transmission line <b>202</b> using suitable connectors <b>120</b> as previously discussed, with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Specifically, each of the four (4) element transmission lines <b>202</b> have equal lengths, and each of the four (4) element transmission lines <b>202</b> are terminated in its characteristic impedance. As a result, each of the four (4) element transmission lines <b>202</b> provide an equal amount of phase delay to signals they carry. It is also contemplated that element transmission lines <b>202</b> may be comprised of different lengths, provided that the amount of phase delay provided by the lengths of delay lines <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, and <b>214</b> are appropriately adjusted for the phase delay created by element transmission lines <b>202</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0036">Antenna unit <b>11</b>A is coupled via element transmission line <b>202</b> and connectors <b>120</b> to a variable attenuator <b>204</b> of phasing circuit <b>200</b>. The variable attenuator <b>204</b> allows for the compensation of delay line attenuation caused in portions of the phasing circuit <b>200</b>, and other variations that may affect signals received by each of the antenna elements <b>11</b>A-D. Antenna unit <b>11</b>B is coupled via element transmission line <b>202</b> and connector <b>120</b> to a delay line <b>208</b> of phasing circuit <b>200</b>. Delay line <b>208</b> typically includes a coaxial cable of a specific length corresponding to the desired amount of delay that is needed to be applied to the signal received by antenna unit <b>11</b>B to generate a null in the direction of ND shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. For example, a delay of S may be created by selecting a suitable length for delay line <b>208</b>. Antenna unit <b>11</b>C is also coupled via element transmission line <b>202</b> and connectors <b>120</b> to delay line <b>210</b> of phasing circuit <b>200</b>. Delay line <b>210</b> typically includes a coaxial cable of a specific length corresponding to the desired amount of delay that is needed to be applied to the signal received by antenna unit <b>11</b>C to generate a null in the direction of ND shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. For example, a delay of 2 S may be created by selecting a suitable length for delay line <b>210</b>. Furthermore, output of delay line <b>210</b> is coupled to a variable attenuator <b>212</b>, which allows a user to adjust the amount of compensation needed to overcome the attenuation of phase inverter <b>220</b>, which will be discussed later, and to adjust for other variations that may affect signals received by each of the antenna elements <b>11</b>A-D. It is also contemplated that an attenuator may be placed at other points in the circuit, such as at the output of combiner <b>218</b>, at the output of phase inverter <b>220</b>, or at the input of combiner <b>218</b>, in place of attenuator <b>212</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0037">Additionally, antenna unit <b>11</b>D is coupled via element transmission line <b>202</b> and connectors <b>120</b> to delay line <b>214</b> of phasing circuit <b>200</b>. Delay line <b>214</b> typically includes a coaxial cable of a specific length corresponding to the desired amount of delay that is needed to be applied to the signal received by antenna unit <b>11</b>D to generate a null in the direction of ND shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. For example, a delay of S may be created by selecting a suitable length for delay line <b>214</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0038">With delay now referenced to the input of phasing circuit <b>200</b> from antenna unit <b>11</b>C, and assuming a signal arriving from the null direction ND, the output signal of attenuator <b>204</b> having a 2 S delay (due to the physical separation of antenna units <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>C), and the output signal of attenuator <b>212</b>, after being delayed by 2 S by delay line <b>210</b>, is passed to combiner <b>216</b>. Further, output signals of delay line <b>208</b> having a 2 S delay (due to the physical separation of antenna units <b>11</b>B and <b>11</b>C causing a delay of S, and delay line <b>208</b> causing a further delay of S), and delay line <b>214</b> having a 2 S delay (due to the physical separation of antenna units <b>11</b>D and <b>11</b>C causing a delay of S, and delay line <b>214</b> causing a further delay of S), corresponding to antenna units <b>11</b>B and <b>11</b>D respectively, are coupled to a combiner <b>218</b>. Combiners <b>216</b> and <b>218</b> combine the signals supplied to their inputs. With the magnitude of any of the four (4) signals from antenna units <b>11</b>A-D being regarded as a reference of one, the output of combiner <b>216</b> is a signal with a magnitude of two (2) having a delay of 2 S, and the output of combiner <b>218</b> is a signal with a magnitude of two (2) with a delay of 2 S. Specifically, combiners <b>216</b> and <b>218</b> are configured such that they provide a constant impedance load for attenuators <b>204</b> and <b>212</b>, and delay lines <b>208</b> and <b>214</b>. It should also be appreciated that combiners <b>216</b>, and <b>218</b> may comprise a magic tee, a zero degree hybrid combiner, an in-phase hybrid combiner, or the like. The output of the combiner <b>218</b> is coupled to a phase inverter <b>220</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0039">Phase inverter <b>220</b> inverts signals from combiner <b>218</b> by 180 degrees of phase shift, regardless of the signal frequency. Thus, the signal provided by combiner <b>218</b> is inverted, such that the signal has a magnitude of 2 and a delay of 2 S and shifted by 180 degrees of phase shift. Additionally, the phase inverter <b>220</b> can perform this phase shift over a wide bandwidth or frequency range of signals output from the combiner <b>218</b>. The output of the phase inverter <b>220</b>, and combiner <b>216</b> are coupled into a combiner <b>222</b>. The combiner <b>222</b> is functionally equivalent to combiners <b>216</b> and <b>218</b>. As such, combiner <b>222</b> combines the out inverted signal from phase inverter <b>220</b> with the output signal from combiner <b>216</b>. As a result, the signals are cancelled resulting in a null in the direction of ND as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. Finally, the output of the combiner <b>222</b> is coupled to a transformer <b>224</b>. Transformer <b>224</b> typically is comprised of an impedance matching transformer, used to match the impedance of a load (not shown), with that of phasing circuit <b>200</b>. The output of transformer <b>224</b> is then typically coupled with a load, such as a receiver, via a feedline (not shown), typically comprising a coaxial cable. It should also be appreciated that the combiners <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, and <b>220</b> may be impedance matched to that of the delay lines <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, and <b>214</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0040">Returning to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, other aspects of phasing circuit <b>200</b> will now be discussed below. In particular, phasing circuit <b>200</b> is coupled to antenna units <b>11</b>A-D, via element transmission lines <b>202</b> and suitable connectors <b>120</b> as previously discussed. Element transmission lines <b>202</b> allow the phasing circuit <b>200</b> to obtain signals received by each of the four (4) antenna units <b>11</b>A-D of antenna array <b>201</b> as previously described with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. The four (4) signals obtained by each of the four antenna units <b>11</b>A-D are transferred through the element transmission lines to a set of relays <b>226</b>, which route the received signals to specific portions of the phasing circuit <b>200</b> to be discussed. When the relays <b>226</b>A, <b>226</b>B, and <b>226</b>C are in a first position the signal from antenna unit <b>11</b>A is coupled to attenuator <b>204</b>. The attenuator <b>204</b> allows the phasing circuit <b>200</b> to compensate for any attenuation caused by the delay line <b>208</b>, and any other variations within the phasing circuit <b>200</b>. Further, the signals from antenna units <b>11</b>B-D are coupled to delay line <b>208</b>, delay line <b>210</b>, and delay line <b>214</b>, respectively. Delay lines <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, and <b>214</b> serve to provide a predetermined amount of time delay to the signals received by antenna units <b>11</b>B-D. This time delay allows the present system <b>10</b> to generate a null in the selected direction ND. The output of delay line <b>208</b> and delay line <b>214</b> are coupled to combiner <b>218</b>, where the incoming signals are summed together. Correspondingly, the output of delay line <b>210</b> after being processed by the attenuator <b>212</b> is coupled to combiner <b>216</b>, where the signal is combined with the output of attenuator <b>204</b>. After the signals of combiner <b>218</b> have been combined, the phase angle of the output signal is inverted by 180 degrees by phase inverter <b>220</b>. Phase inverter <b>220</b> may include an inverting transformer with a 1 to 1 winding ratio. Next, the output of phase inverter <b>220</b> and the output of the combiner <b>216</b> are combined by combiner <b>222</b>. The output of combiner <b>222</b> causes the signals from combiner <b>116</b> and phase inverter <b>220</b> to be cancelled. It should be appreciated that combiners <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, and <b>222</b> may be in the form of a magic tee, a zero degree hybrid, or an in-phase hybrid. Additionally, combiners <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, and <b>222</b> may include transformers with a 1 to 1 winding ratio. The output signal of combiner <b>222</b> is passed through transformer <b>224</b>, which provides impedance matching for a load, such as a receiver, connected via a feedline, such as a coaxial cable (not shown). Connector <b>120</b> is provided to facilitate the connection of such feedline to the output of phasing circuit <b>200</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0041">It should also be appreciated that the antenna pattern, including the direction in which the null is provided in the receiving pattern of the antenna unit array <b>201</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> may be moved by activating relays <b>226</b>A, <b>226</b>B, and <b>226</b>C in a specific manner. By setting relay <b>226</b>A to a second position, the pattern is reversed, such that the null direction is moved to antenna unit <b>11</b>A as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. Thus, signals approaching antenna array <b>201</b> from the direction of antenna unit <b>11</b>A are cancelled by phasing circuit <b>200</b>. Furthermore, by actuating relays <b>226</b>B and <b>226</b>C to move to a second position, the null can be rotated by ninety (90) degrees to provide cancellation of a received signal that approaches antenna array <b>201</b> from the direction of either antenna unit <b>11</b>B or <b>11</b>D, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0042">It will, therefore, be appreciated that one advantage of one or more embodiments of the present antenna system is that the limiting circuit provides sharp limiting with a high limiting threshold to signals received by an antenna unit. Still another advantage of the present invention, is that the limiting circuit includes a limited number of components, thereby reducing cost of manufacture, while increasing the reliability of its operation. Yet another advantage of the present antenna system is that an isolation circuit is utilized to provide isolation between the dipole antenna and any element transmission line coupled to the antenna unit. Another advantage of the present antenna system is that the antenna receiving pattern can have a null fixed in a desired direction, that does not vary in direction over a wide range of operating frequencies.</p>
