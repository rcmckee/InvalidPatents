The circuit includes a flat source of white noise and a CMOS amplifier circuit compensated in the high frequency range. A low-frequency cut-off is selected to maintain high band-width yet eliminate the 1/f amplifier noise tail. A CMOS comparator with a 10 nanosecond rise time converts the analog signal to a binary one. A shift register converts the serial signal to a 4-bit parallel one at a sample rate selected at the knee of the serial dependence curve. Two levels of XOR defect correction produce a BRS at 20 kHZ, which is converted to a 4-bit parallel word, latched and buffered. The entire circuit is powered from the data pins of the parallel port. A device driver interface in the computer operates the RNG. The randomness defects with various levels of correction and sample rates are calculated and the RNG is optimized before manufacture."><meta name="DC.date" content="2004-7-13" scheme="issued"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:3423683" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:3445591" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:3582882" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:3612845" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:3614399" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:3706941" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:3725677" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:3758873" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:3790768" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:3866029" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:3866128" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4176399" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4183088" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4247946" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4339697" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4355366" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4395703" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4433413" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4499551" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4513386" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4527798" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4529870" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4545024" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4578598" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4611183" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4667301" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4799259" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4800590" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4810975" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4811247" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4819818" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4853884" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4855690" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4858122" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4977596" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5007087" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5117380" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5193198" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5214396" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5214761" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5239494" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5317528" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5510698" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5745571" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5825880" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:6070178" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:6195669" scheme="references"><meta name="citation_reference" content="Agnew; Random Sources for Cryptographic Systems; Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Advances in Cryptology-EUROCRYPT &#39;87; Springer-Verlag, Berlin; 1987; pp. 77-81."><meta name="citation_reference" content="Al-Bayati et al.; Novel Design of a Simple and Accurate White Gaussian Noise Generator; Int.

The circuit includes a flat source of white noise and a CMOS amplifier circuit compensated in the high frequency range. A low-frequency cut-off is selected to maintain high band-width yet eliminate the 1/f amplifier noise tail. A CMOS comparator with a 10 nanosecond rise time converts the analog signal to a binary one. A shift register converts the serial signal to a 4-bit parallel one at a sample rate selected at the knee of the serial dependence curve. Two levels of XOR defect correction produce a BRS at 20 kHZ, which is converted to a 4-bit parallel word, latched and buffered. The entire circuit is powered from the data pins of the parallel port. A device driver interface in the computer operates the RNG. The randomness defects with various levels of correction and sample rates are calculated and the RNG is optimized before manufacture.</div>

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>The invention in general relates to random number generators, and more particularly to a random number generator that generates true binary random sequences.</p>
    <p>2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p>It has become widely recognized that random number generators are fundamentally important in the computer age. See Stephen K. Park and Keith W. Miller, “Random Number Generators: Good Ones Are Hard To Find”, in <i>Computing Practices</i>, October 1988, V. 31, No. 10, pp. 1192-1201. Random number generators may be divided into two types: true random number generators, which generate numbers from a non-deterministic source, and pseudorandom number generators, which generate numbers from a deterministic algorithm. A high quality random number generator is necessary for functions from Monte Carlo-based studies used in computer modeling of the global economy, to cryptography, to parapsychological studies, to marketing research, to lottery games. Thus, it is not surprising that the literature reveals hundreds of random number generators. See, for example, the following U.S. Pat. No. 3,423,683 issued to E. S. Kelsey et al.; No. 3,445,591 issued to D. R. Koehler et al.; No. 3,612,845 issued to Reed C. Lawlor; No. 3,706,941 issued to Charles E. Cohn; No. 3,725,677 issued to Reed C. Lawlor; No. 3,758,873 issued to Herbert E. Miller; No. 4,183,088 issued to Robert E. Simmons; No. 4,395,703 issued to Gerald V. Piosenka; No. 4,513,386 issued to Sydney Glazer; 4,578,598 issued to Mark E. Faulaber; No. 4,858,122 issued to William Kreisner; and No. 5,239,494 issued to Edmund C. Golbeck; and the following papers: Masatugu Isida and Hiroji Ikeda, “Random Number Generator” in <i>Proceedings of the Institute of Statistical Mechanics</i>, 1956, pp. 119-126; Helmut Schmidt, “A Quantum Mechanical Random Number Generator for PSI Tests” in The Journal of Parapsychology, circa 1972, pp. 219-224; and Teruyuki Izimi, “Universal Random Signal Generator”, in <i>Electrical Engineering in Japan</i>, Vol. 99, No. 4, 1979, pp. 124-130. Yet, there are few “random number generators” on the market today that actually produce random numbers. High quality true random number generators are still in the realm of large-budget projects at major research institutions.</p>
    <p>A random number generator (RNG) that interfaces directly with a computer would be of particular value since random numbers are often used in conjunction with a computer, and a direct interface allows a researcher or other computer user to simply call up the number generator and use the numbers it produces within the context of their program. See for example, James H. Macomber and Charles S. White, “An n-Dimensional Uniform Random Number Generator Suitable for IBM-Compatible Microcomputers”, in <i>Interfaces</i>, Vol. 20, No. 3, May-June 1990, pp. 49-59. Because the most common computers today are digital, RNG's that interface with computers generally generate a binary random sequence (BRS) rather than a sequence of analog or floating point numbers, which BRS's may be used as generated, converted to uniform distributed numbers, converted to Gaussian distributed numbers or converted to any other type of distribution. Many computer programs that utilize random numbers are statistical in nature; that is, they depend on large numbers of events which are averaged in some manner to reach a valid conclusion. For this to be accomplished over reasonable time periods, these programs require that large quantities of binary bits or random numbers be generated in short periods. True random number generators usually trade off speed for randomness, thus are relatively slow. As a result, at this time it appears that the available random number generators that interface directly with computers are all software-based, pseudorandom number generators. See, Macomber and White, supra; Niederreiter, supra; and Park and Miller, supra.</p>
    <p>While pseudorandom number generators are suitably fast for a computer, they cannot generate a true random number because they are generated by algorithms which are deterministic, i.e. they are totally predictable given knowledge of the algorithm used. In addition, most pseudorandom number generators used with computers produce number sequences which fail even moderately stringent statistical randomness tests. It is known that to generate a true random number, one must start with a non-deterministic signal, such as white noise generated by a resistor, diode, or other electronic device, the time between radioactive particle decay, the locations of detected photo-events, or other signal source that is essentially random because it is based on quantum mechanics or other statistically random process. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,176,399 issued to Jean-Claude Hoffmann et al., and the following papers: G. B. Agnew, “Random Sources For Cryptographic Systems”, in <i>Lecture Notes in Computer Science</i>-<i>Advances in Cryptology</i>-<i>Eurocrypt</i>'87, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1987, pp. 77-81; and Anthony J. Martino and G. Michael Morris, “Optical Random Number Generator Based On Photoevent Locations”, in <i>Applied Optics</i>, Vol. 30, No. 8, 10 March 1991, pp. 981-989. We have referred to these signals as “essentially” random, because even these non-deterministic sources exhibit some defects because they are generated with macroscopic, real world devices.</p>
    <p>It is known that the randomness in such non-deterministic signals can be improved by digital processing. See for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,545,024 issued to David P. Maher et al., and the paper: Helmut Schmidt, “Quantum-Mechanical Random-Number Generator”, in <i>Journal of Applied Physics</i>, Vol. 41, No. 2, February 1970, pp. 462-468. In particular it is known to improve randomness by using EXCLUSIVE OR X(OR) gates to discard certain bits. See, U.S. Pat. No. 4,355,366 issued to Sigmund N. Porter. It is also known to use comparators or other electronic devices to convert analog noise signals to binary signals. See, U.S. Pat. No. 4,545,024 cited above and H. Sutcliffe, “Noise-spectrum Measurement at Subaudio Frequencies”, in Proceedings of the IEEE, Vol. 112, No. 2, February 1965, pp. 301-309.</p>
    <p>Despite the fact that all of the above has been known for many years, a practical, inexpensive, fast, high-quality true random number generator that interfaces directly with a computer is not presently available. In fact, some authorities maintain that such a device is not practically possible. See, Harald Niederreiter, <i>Random Number Generation and Quasi</i>-<i>Monte Carlo Methods</i>, Chapter 7, section 7.2, p. 164, Society For Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Philadelphia 1992; and Aaldert Compagner, “Definitions of Randomness”, <i>American Journal of Physics</i>, Vol. 59, No. 8, August 1991, pp. 700-705, at page 702. As a result, “random number generators” used with computers today are pseudo-random number generators.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention solves the above problems by providing a true random number generator (RNG) in which the defects in randomness in the sequence generated are so small that one would have to run a test for trillions of years to demonstrate the defects with 95% confidence level. The random number generator plugs into the parallel port of any personal computer and is directly accessed via device driver software installed in the computer. The RNG is as easy to use as a printer, modem, or any other peripheral and is fast, producing a binary random sequence (BRS) of up to 10,000 bits per second, or 20,000 bits per second if a number of defects that could be demonstrated in several years at 95% confidence level is acceptable. Moreover, the device is inexpensive, costing little more than a modem or word-processing software.</p>
    <p>The random number generator according to the invention amplifies the analog signal from a non-deterministic signal generator, passes it through a comparator to create a binary signal, which is sampled and stored in a shift register to create a digital signal. The randomness is then improved by using two levels of EXCLUSIVE OR (XOR) correction gates.</p>
    <p>The source of the non-deterministic signal is preferably the thermal noise of a resistor, which has an essentially flat average amplitude versus frequency spectrum. The amplifier that amplifies the signal is a low-noise amplifier, so that the amplifier noise, which is not flat, contributes one-third or less of the total noise, preferably 25% or less. Prior to passing through the comparator, the signal is processed in several novel ways to improve its ability to generate random numbers. As is common in the amplifier art, the 1/F low-frequency tail of the amplifier noise is cut off with a high pass filter. However, the cut-off is made at a relatively low 100 Hertz (Hz) to include as much of the white noise spectrum as possible. That is, since the optimum spectrum from which to generate a random number is a white noise spectrum containing all frequencies, utilizing a relatively low high-pass filter decreases the defects in the final random number sequence. Further, the high frequency fall off that is common to op amps due to gain-bandwidth product limitations, is compensated for. Starting with a low-noise amplifier and compensating for the high frequency fall off helps keep the signal coming into the comparator essentially flat, preferably within ±0.25 db, over a wide bandwidth, preferably about 100 Hz to 100 kiloHerz (KHz). The comparator itself is a very high speed comparator, which retains the bandwidth of the analog section. The comparator offset is adjusted, preferably using a selectable resistor, so that there is a nearly equal number of high and low bits generated by the comparator. Thus, the binary signal produced by the comparator is a stable, highly random signal.</p>
    <p>The sampling frequency is selected to be the optimum frequency to produce a high frequency stream of highly random binary bits. The sampling period is preferably selected to be at the knee of the serial dependence versus delay time curve, sometimes called the auto-correlation function. In the preferred embodiment of the invention this is 12.5 microseconds, which results in a bit stream at a frequency of 80,000 bits per second. Two levels of correction with the XOR gates decreases the defects in randomness to the extremely low levels mentioned above, and reduces the frequency to the 20,000 bits per second mentioned above. A third level of XOR function may be accomplished by software in the computer, reducing the bit rate to 10,000 per second.</p>
    <p>It has been discovered that the randomness of an RNG producing a binary random sequence according to the invention can be predicted by the equations:</p>
    <p>
      <maths> <formula-text> <i>B</i> <sub>2</sub> <i>*=−SD</i>(<b>1</b>); and  (1)</formula-text> </maths> </p>
    <p>
      <maths> <formula-text> <i>SD</i>(<b>1</b>)*≦<i>SD</i>(<b>1</b>)<sup>2</sup> <i>+SD</i>(<b>2</b>)<sup>2</sup> <i>,SD</i>(<b>2</b>)*≦<i>SD</i>(<b>1</b>)<sup>2 </sup> <i>+SD</i>(<b>4</b>)<sup>2</sup>,  (2)</formula-text> </maths> </p>
    <p>where SD(t) is the serial dependence as a function time, SD(<b>1</b>) indicates the first order serial dependence, that is the serial dependence at the first sample period, SD(<b>2</b>) second order serial dependence, etc., and B<sub>2 </sub>is the fractional bias in the 1, 0 probability given by the equation:</p>
    <p>
      <maths> <formula-text> <i>B</i> <sub>2</sub>=[N(<b>1</b>)−0.5N]/0.5N,  (3)</formula-text> </maths> </p>
    <p>where N(<b>1</b>) is the number of 1's in a binary random sequence of length N. In equations (1) and (2) the star, *, indicates the statistic at the output of each level of XOR error correction while the unstarred values are those at the input of the error correction level. These equations were used to determine the number of levels of correction that were required to produce a stream of random numbers in which any lack of randomness could be detected given the measured amount of statistical defect at the XOR's input. Thus, the use of equations 1 through 3 permit the design of the RNG to be optimized: enough randomness defect correction can be applied to remove any possibility of detecting non-randomness, but not excessive correction that would slow the device and add to its manufacturing cost.</p>
    <p>The 20 kHertz stream of random bits is preferably converted into a 4-bit word with a shift register, latched, then sent to a buffer which isolates the random number generator from cable transients. An interrupt is generated when a 4-bit number is ready. A device driver in the computer recognizes the interrupt, reads the number and stores it in a memory buffer for use on demand by the user.</p>
    <p>The entire random number generator is preferably mounted on a single small printed circuit board (PCB) which is adapted to be connected to and powered by the conventional parallel port of any personal computer. The power is taken off selected pins, preferably the 8-bit date output, of the parallel port while the ground is connected to the parallel port ground pins. The device driver installed in the computer simply applies the appropriate high signals to the selected pins to power the RNG. A negative voltage for the analog noise generator circuit is provided by charge pumps. Special circuits protect the RNG if the wrong voltages are applied to critical pins.</p>
    <p>The RNG is isolated from external sources of non-randomness. As indicated above, the output drivers of the RNG are isolated from the random number generator itself to prevent any loading or interference output on the lines from feeding back into the RNG. The analog noise generator, the comparator, and the digital portions of the circuit have separate power supplies. All power supplies are filtered to remove transients.</p>
    <p>A low amplitude portion of the circuitry is isolated from the normal amplitude circuitry and shielded to protect it from any external EMI or ESI source. The shield preferably comprises a ground plane on the PCB surrounding the low amplitude circuit, except for a small channel through which traces to the digital circuit pass, and a metal enclosure that encloses both sides of the board and bolts to the PCB with a flange on the enclosure contacting the ground plane. The flange also eliminates the effect of fringing through the thickness of the circuit board.</p>
    <p>The device driver in the computer finds and tests the installed RNG each time the computer is turned on.</p>

Module <b>1102</b> includes a housing <b>1110</b> and a circuit <b>100</b> mounted on a circuit board <b>800</b> that is enclosed in housing <b>1110</b>. It should be understood that the specific random number generator systems and circuits shown in the figures and described herein, are exemplary. That is, they are intended to show preferred examples of the invention so that those skilled in the art can fully understand and implement it. They are not intended to limit the invention to the specific examples described and shown.</p>
    <p>In this disclosure the term “number” in the context of a random number generator means any signal that can be used to generate a binary or other number. That is, as known in the art of random number generators, the randomness may be in a sequence of binary signals, a Gaussian or any other distribution of signals, a sequence of signals representing a number between zero and one, a sequence of signals representing a decimal number, or in any other form that includes the desired randomness. In other terms, in this disclosure, random number generator, or RNG, means any device that produces a signal that can be converted to a random or pseudorandom sequence of such numbers. The term specifically includes generators of binary random sequences, or BRS's, but is not limited to such RNGs. The term “a parameter related to X”, where X is some property of a system, includes the property; for example, the phrase, “a parameter related to the delay time”, includes the delay time as well as other related parameters, such as sample rate.</p>
    <p>A block diagram of a preferred embodiment of RNG circuit <b>100</b> is shown in FIG. <b>1</b>. RNG circuit <b>100</b> includes input/output port J<b>2</b>, charge pumps <b>104</b> and <b>105</b>, analog noise generator <b>108</b>, a high frequency compensator and analog to binary converter <b>110</b>, clock <b>112</b>, which includes oscillator <b>114</b> and divider <b>116</b>, shift register <b>118</b>, randomness defect reducer <b>120</b>, shift register <b>122</b>, latch <b>124</b>, buffer <b>126</b>, connector/jumper <b>128</b>, capacitors <b>131</b>-<b>134</b>, and resistors <b>140</b>-<b>145</b>. The RNG circuit <b>100</b> can be divided into a low amplitude portion <b>101</b> that includes analog noise generator <b>108</b>, and a normal amplitude portion <b>109</b> that includes the rest of the circuit <b>100</b>. Here “low amplitude portion” means that portion of the circuitry in which the amplitude, i.e. voltage level, of the noise signal is below about 0.1 volts peak to peak.</p>
    <p>Input/output port J<b>2</b> is preferably a conventional DB-<b>25</b>, right-angle, PCB mount, female connector, and the numbers <b>2</b>-<b>15</b> and <b>18</b>-<b>25</b> next to the input lines <b>150</b>-<b>158</b> and output lines <b>160</b>-<b>164</b> indicate the pin numbers of the connector. Pins <b>5</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>6</b> provide positive voltage power sources for the various components of the RNG circuit <b>100</b>, and pins <b>18</b>-<b>25</b> are the ground pins of the connector and provide the ground connection to the various components; ground in this disclosure is shown by three lines such as at <b>159</b>. Note that pin <b>6</b> provides the power to multiple components of the digital circuit, i.e. divider <b>116</b>, shift register <b>118</b>, randomness defect reducer <b>120</b>, shift register <b>122</b>, latch <b>124</b>, and buffer <b>126</b> via line <b>168</b>, while the analog noise generator <b>108</b> and the high frequency compensator and analog to binary converter <b>110</b> have separate power sources, i.e. pins <b>4</b> and <b>9</b> and pins <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, respectively. The interrupt signal from the RNG circuit <b>100</b> is applied to pin <b>10</b>, and a sequence of four-bit random words is applied to pins <b>11</b>-<b>15</b> by RNG circuit <b>100</b>.</p>
    <p>Charge pumps <b>104</b> and <b>105</b> provide a voltage of opposite sign to the voltage on pins <b>2</b>-<b>9</b> of connector J<b>2</b>, that is, a negative voltage. Thus they are labeled −VA and −VB, respectively. The negative voltage is necessary to run analog noise generator circuit <b>108</b>. Pin <b>5</b> of connector J<b>2</b> is connected to charge pump <b>104</b>, and pin <b>6</b> is connected to charge pump <b>105</b>. A 40 kHz clock pulse is applied to both of the charge pumps via line <b>170</b> from divider <b>116</b>. Each of the charge pumps <b>104</b> and <b>105</b> apply the negative voltage to analog noise generator <b>108</b> via lines <b>171</b> and <b>172</b>, respectively. Pins <b>4</b> and <b>9</b> of connector J<b>2</b> connect to analog noise generator <b>108</b>, the output of which is applied to high frequency compensator and analog to binary converter <b>110</b> via line <b>174</b>. Pins <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> of connector J<b>2</b> connect to high frequency compensator and analog to binary converter <b>110</b>, the output of which is applied to shift register <b>118</b> through capacitor <b>132</b>. The node <b>176</b> between capacitor <b>132</b> and shift register <b>118</b> is connected to power source line <b>168</b> through resistor <b>142</b> and to ground through resistor <b>143</b>. Pin <b>7</b> of connector J<b>2</b> is connected to oscillator <b>114</b>, and the output of the oscillator is applied to divider <b>116</b> through capacitor <b>131</b>. The node <b>178</b> between capacitor <b>131</b> and divider <b>116</b> is connected to power source line <b>168</b> through resistor <b>141</b> and to ground through resistor <b>140</b>. As indicated above, line <b>170</b> from divider <b>116</b> provides a 40 kHz clock pulse; line <b>180</b> provides an 80 kHz clock pulse. Lines <b>170</b> and <b>180</b> connect to the two inputs of connector/jumper <b>128</b>. The output <b>182</b> of connector/jumper <b>128</b> connects to divider <b>116</b> and to shift register <b>118</b>. Divider <b>116</b> also applies a clock signal to shift register <b>122</b> via line <b>183</b>, and another clock signal to latch <b>124</b> and buffer <b>126</b> via line <b>184</b>. Shift register <b>118</b> applies four bits to randomness defect reducer <b>120</b> via lines <b>185</b>, and randomness defect reducer <b>120</b> applies one bit to shift register <b>122</b> via line <b>186</b>. Shift register <b>122</b> applies four bits to latch <b>124</b> via lines <b>188</b>, and latch <b>124</b> applies four bits to buffer via lines <b>190</b>. Line <b>158</b> from pin <b>6</b> of connector J<b>2</b> is connected to power line <b>168</b> through resistor <b>144</b> and to buffer power line <b>192</b> through resistor <b>145</b>. Power line <b>168</b> is connected to ground through capacitor <b>133</b>, and buffer power line <b>192</b> is connected to ground via capacitor <b>134</b>. Capacitor <b>133</b> and resistor <b>145</b> filter the power to buffer <b>126</b> while capacitor <b>134</b> and resistor <b>144</b> filter the power to the other digital components. The filtering for buffer <b>126</b> is separate from the filtering of the other components to isolate the buffer. Resistors <b>142</b> and <b>143</b> and capacitor <b>132</b> couple the AC signal on node <b>175</b> to an average voltage on node <b>176</b> that is at the midpoint “between the rails” of the electronic components of shift register <b>118</b>. As is known in the art, “between the rails” means between the high and low voltages at which the components are being operated. Likewise resistors <b>140</b> and <b>141</b> and capacitor <b>131</b> couple the AC signal on node <b>177</b> to an average voltage on node <b>178</b> that is at the midpoint between the rails of the electronic components of divider <b>116</b>.</p>
    <p>The detailed electrical circuits of the charge pumps <b>104</b> and <b>105</b>, the analog noise generator <b>108</b>, the high frequency compensator and analog to binary converter <b>110</b>, the clock <b>112</b>, the shift registers <b>118</b> and <b>122</b>, the randomness defect reducer <b>120</b>, the latch <b>124</b>, and the buffer <b>126</b> are given in FIGS. <b>2</b> through <b>7</b>. The physical layout of the circuits on a circuit board <b>800</b> is shown in FIG. 8, a shield <b>900</b> that shields the low amplitude portion <b>101</b> of the circuitry <b>100</b> is shown in FIGS. 9 and 10, and the manner in which the circuit <b>100</b> on circuit board <b>800</b> fits within housing <b>1110</b> and is connected to the rest of the system <b>1100</b> is shown in FIG. <b>11</b>. FIG. 15 shows a portion of another embodiment of an RNG system <b>1500</b> in which the RNG circuit <b>100</b> is mounted on an add-on board <b>1502</b> for mounting within the case of a personal computer <b>1104</b>. FIG. 16 shows a portion of a third embodiment of an RNG system <b>1600</b> in which the circuit <b>100</b> is mounted directly on the motherboard of a PC <b>1104</b>.</p>
    <p>In the circuit <b>100</b> of the embodiment of FIG. 1, a resistor <b>300</b> (FIG. 3) is ultimately the source of the essentially random pulses that produce the random numbers, and a set of three EXCLUSIVE OR X(OR) gates <b>120</b> (FIG. 7) correct for randomness defects. FIG. 17 shows an alternative embodiment of an RNG circuit <b>1700</b> in which an intrinsically random quantum source <b>1702</b> provides the true random pulses that produce the random numbers, and a divider <b>1710</b> transforms the pulse sequence into a sequence with random transition timing and equal 1,0 probability. As will be clear from the following description, the RNG according to the invention may be implemented in other ways, other sources of random pulses and other randomness defect correctors may be used, and those shown may be used in other combinations. The examples just summarized are intended to illustrate the invention sufficiently that those skilled in the art may practice it either as shown or in many other ways.</p>
    <p>2. Detailed Description</p>
    <p>FIG. 2 is a detailed circuit diagram of the charge pump <b>105</b> utilized in the preferred embodiment of the invention. Charge pump <b>105</b> includes integrated circuit IC<b>5</b>, capacitors <b>210</b>-<b>213</b>, and resistors <b>220</b> and <b>222</b>. Charge pump <b>105</b> could also be considered to include other elements, such as capacitor <b>310</b> in FIG. 3; however, capacitor <b>310</b> has been made a part of analog noise generator <b>108</b> so that the circuits for the two charge pumps <b>104</b> and <b>105</b> are identical, which simplifies the discussion. Thus, it should be understood that, in the present disclosure, whether a particular component is included in one subcircuit rather than another is often a matter of convenience.</p>
    <p>Integrated circuit IC<b>5</b> preferably is a CD74HC4053E triple 2-channel analog multiplexer available from Harris Semiconductor. This is a CMOS low-power chip, which allows the system to be run off the power available on the parallel port <b>1150</b> of a computer. For this and the other integrated circuits shown in the drawings, the pins are shown as lines connected to the rectangle representing the IC, or a triangle representing a portion of an IC, and the numbers next to the lines indicate the pin numbers. A + sign next to a capacitor indicates that the capacitor is preferably a polarized capacitor and designates the positive side of the capacitor. Pins <b>1</b> and <b>7</b> of IC<b>5</b> are connected together, to ground through capacitor <b>212</b>, and to line <b>172</b>. Pins <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>, and <b>11</b> are connected together and to clock line <b>170</b> through capacitor <b>213</b> and resistor <b>222</b> in parallel. Pins <b>16</b>, <b>12</b>, and <b>5</b> are connected together, to ground through capacitor <b>210</b>, and to the No. <b>5</b> pin of connector J<b>2</b> through resistor <b>220</b>. Pins <b>14</b> and <b>4</b> are connected together and to pin <b>15</b> through capacitor <b>211</b>. Pins <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>8</b>, and <b>13</b> are connected to ground.</p>
    <p>Charge pump <b>104</b> is identical to charge pump <b>105</b>. As indicated in FIG. 1, it is connected to pin <b>5</b> rather than pin <b>8</b> of connector J<b>2</b>, and its output is connected to analog noise generator <b>108</b> is via line <b>171</b> instead of line <b>172</b>. Two charge pumps are used because of limited current available on the pins of connectors J<b>2</b>. As known in the electronics art, charge pumps are used to produce a negative voltage from a positive one. The charge pumps operate by a positive charge being placed on the + side of capacitor <b>211</b> in one half-clock-cycle, which attracts a negative charge to the opposite side. This negative charge is transferred to output pins <b>1</b> and <b>7</b> and accumulates on the negative side of capacitor <b>212</b> on the next half-clock-cycle. Capacitor <b>210</b> and resistor <b>220</b> form a filter circuit for filtering transients and noise on the power supply pin <b>5</b> of connector J<b>2</b>. Similarly, as will be seen below, each of the other connections to the power supply pins <b>2</b> through <b>9</b> of connector J<b>2</b> has such a filter circuit to isolate the circuit <b>100</b> from transients. The circuit formed by capacitor <b>213</b> and resistor <b>222</b> couples the clock signal into the charge pump and also limits the current in the circuit and protects the circuit if the wrong voltage is placed on any of the pins <b>5</b> through <b>8</b> of connector J<b>2</b>. It is noted that the charge pumps run off of an external clock, unlike some commercially available charge pumps. While the RNG circuit <b>100</b> according to the invention is powered by the data lines of a parallel port <b>1150</b> and a pair of charge pumps <b>104</b> and <b>105</b>, other power sources may be used. The control lines of the parallel port <b>1150</b> may also be used as a power source. In some embodiments the preferred power source is a power supply separate from that of computer <b>1105</b>, such as a battery together with a voltage regulator. Such an independent power supply is preferred when the random number generator is used for cryptographic purposes.</p>
    <p>The negative voltage produced by the charge pumps is used by the analog noise generator circuit <b>108</b>. Turning to FIG. 3, the preferred embodiment of the detailed circuit for analog noise generator <b>108</b> is shown.

Pin <b>4</b> of IC <b>2</b>, the V− supply, is connected to ground through capacitor <b>316</b> and to node <b>351</b> through resistor <b>336</b>. Pin <b>8</b> of IC<b>2</b>, the V+ supply, is connected to node <b>350</b> through resistor <b>333</b> and to ground through capacitor <b>315</b>. The output of op amp <b>304</b>, pin I of IC<b>2</b>, is connected to the non-inverting input of op amp <b>305</b>, pin <b>5</b> of IC<b>2</b>, through capacitor <b>317</b>. Pin <b>5</b> of IC<b>2</b> is also connected to ground through resistor <b>339</b>. The inverting input of op amp <b>305</b>, pin <b>5</b> of IC<b>2</b>, is connected to its output, pin <b>7</b> of IC<b>2</b>, through resistor <b>341</b>, and to ground through resistor <b>340</b>. Op amp <b>305</b> also has connections to V+ (pin <b>8</b>) and V− (pin <b>4</b>), but as is conventional in electronic notation, these are not shown again. The output of op amp <b>305</b>, pin <b>7</b> of IC<b>2</b>, is connected to the non-inverting input of op amp <b>306</b>, pin <b>3</b> of IC<b>1</b>.

The output of op amp <b>307</b>, pin <b>7</b> of IC<b>1</b>, is connected to line <b>174</b> which is the output to the high frequency compensator and analog to binary converter <b>110</b> (FIG. <b>4</b>).</p>
    <p>Capacitors <b>310</b>-<b>313</b>, <b>315</b>, <b>316</b> and <b>320</b> are power supply filter capacitors. The power supply is unregulated, since the voltage and current overhead of a regulator would greatly reduce the power available through connector J<b>2</b>. Capacitors <b>317</b> and <b>319</b> are high pass filters which remove the input offset voltages which could drive the system to saturation if amplified. Each of amplifiers <b>303</b>-<b>307</b> has a pair of resistors, such as resistors <b>334</b> and <b>335</b> associated with op amp <b>303</b>, which form a voltage divider that determines the gain of the amplifier. The gain of amplifiers <b>303</b>-<b>307</b> are approximately 3.8, 6.6, 6.6., 6.6, and 6, respectively. The TL06X integrated circuits, where X is 0, 1, 2, and 4, are very low power amplifiers that permit the circuit to be run off the parallel port <b>1150</b>. Other amplifiers that could be used include the National Semiconductor LF44Y op amp, where Y=1, 2, or 4 and the Burr-Brown AD548 and AD648 single and dual op amps. The use of one or more of these op amps or equivalent op amps in the amplification function is a feature of the invention. Less than a milliamp is pulled from each power supply pin of connector J<b>2</b>. Resistor <b>300</b> is the noise generating resistor. The noise of resistor <b>300</b> and the noise of amplifier <b>303</b> add to generate the total noise input to the series of amplifiers <b>304</b>-<b>307</b>. The resistor noise is essentially flat, that is, flat within ±0.1 db from about 1 Hz to several hundred kHz, while the noise of the amplifier follows a typical 1/f curve at low frequencies. The amplifier <b>303</b> contributes about 25% of the total noise. It is a feature of the invention that the amplifier <b>303</b> contributes only up to one-third of the total noise output on pin <b>6</b>. The output signal at <b>174</b> is, on the average, essentially within ±1 db from about 100 Hz to about 120 kHz and about 1.8 volts peak to peak.</p>
    <p>FIG. 4 shows the detailed circuit diagram for the high frequency compensator and analog to binary converter <b>110</b>. Circuit <b>110</b> includes integrated circuit IC<b>4</b>, enclosed by the dotted line in FIG. 4, capacitors <b>410</b>-<b>412</b>, and resistors <b>420</b>-<b>424</b>. Integrated circuit IC<b>4</b> is preferably a CD74HCU04E hex inverter available from Harris Semiconductor. Input line <b>174</b> is connected to node <b>405</b> through capacitor <b>410</b> and resistor <b>420</b> in parallel, and node <b>405</b> is connected to pin <b>1</b> of IC<b>4</b> through capacitor <b>411</b>. Pin <b>1</b> of IC<b>4</b> is connected to pin <b>2</b> through resistor <b>421</b>, and to one of pin <b>7</b> or pin <b>14</b> of IC<b>4</b> through resistor <b>422</b>. The choice of whether it is connected to pin <b>7</b> or pin <b>14</b> of IC<b>4</b> depends on whether the internal reference is offset low or high. Pin <b>7</b> is connected to ground. Pin <b>2</b> is also connected to pin <b>3</b>, pin <b>4</b> is connected to pin <b>5</b>, pin <b>6</b> to pin <b>13</b>, pin <b>12</b> to pin <b>11</b>, and pin <b>10</b> to pin <b>9</b>. Pin <b>14</b> of IC <b>4</b> is connected to ground through capacitor <b>412</b>, to the No. <b>2</b> pin of connector J<b>2</b> through resistor <b>423</b> and to the No. <b>3</b> pin of connector J<b>2</b> through resistor <b>324</b>. The latter connection provides the Vcc connection of IC <b>4</b>. As before, the pin <b>14</b> and pin <b>7</b> connections also represent the connections of each of the six inverters in IC<b>4</b> to Vcc and ground. In this configuration, the six inverters of IC<b>4</b> are linked output to input in series. The output of the sixth inverter on pin <b>8</b> of IC<b>4</b> provides the output of analog to binary converter <b>110</b> on line <b>175</b>.</p>
    <p>The XHCU04 IC, where X is 54 or 74, is a low-power CMOS chip that has very fast operating speed. While the chip is termed a hex inverter, in the configuration shown in FIG. 4 the first inverter provides a linear amplifier <b>417</b> and the last five provide a comparator <b>440</b>. The first inverter <b>417</b> and the circuitry to the left of it in FIG. 4 comprise a high frequency compensator <b>430</b>. The compensator <b>430</b> is part of the analog circuit. The output signal on pin <b>2</b> of IC<b>4</b> is an analog signal that goes both above and below a reference voltage that is internal to IC<b>4</b>. Comparator <b>440</b> provides the analog to binary conversion for the RNG. Comparator <b>440</b> compares the voltage on its input, pin <b>3</b> of IC<b>4</b>, with the internal reference voltage and produces a “high” output if the input signal is above the reference and a “low” output if the signal is below the reference voltage. Preferably, the “high” output is a positive voltage between about 1.8 volts and 3.5 volts, and the “low” output is zero voltage. Since each of the five comparator stages also amplifies the output signal, it can also be viewed as a fast, low-power, CMOS amplifier <b>440</b>. The use of the XHCU04 chip as a comparator to create a binary signal from the analog signal is a feature of the invention. Its use ultimately permits a high output bit rate while using only the power from the parallel port <b>1150</b>. Each inverter in the series in effect speeds up the transitions between the “high” state and “low” state. Thus all five inverters are used to provide as fast a transition as possible. The intrinsic bias level of the CMOS inverters is caused to appear as the average level at pin <b>2</b> because of the negative feedback loop provided by resistor <b>421</b>. Precise trimming of this bias is accomplished by selecting resistor <b>422</b> so that the output of the analog to binary converter <b>110</b> has a balanced 1/0 probability.</p>
    <p>The series impedance of resistor <b>420</b> and capacitor <b>411</b> determine the high pass cut-off frequency according to the formula fc =1/2πRC. The selection of this frequency is also a feature of the invention. In the preferred embodiment, the cut-off frequency is approximately 36 Hertz. It is known to use high pass filters to cut off the low frequency 1/f tail in amplifiers. However, the inventor has recognized that cutting off any of the band-width of the circuit <b>100</b> introduces defects in the randomness of the sequence generated by the circuit.</p>
    <p>The parallel impedance of resistor <b>420</b> and capacitor <b>410</b> produces a high frequency pole which compensates for a high frequency drop off in the incoming signal, which drop off is typical of amplifiers. The effect of compensation on the output at pin <b>2</b> of IC <b>4</b> is shown in FIG. <b>13</b>. The output at pin <b>2</b> in microvolts per root-Hertz is shown for the uncompensated and compensated outputs. Actual measured values are given as solid dots and the theoretical values are shown as solid lines. The high frequency pole alters the signal so that at pin <b>2</b> of IC<b>4</b> the −3 db point goes out to about 170 kHz.</p>
    <p>Turning to FIG. 5, the oscillator circuit <b>114</b> is shown. Oscillator <b>114</b> includes integrated circuit IC<b>10</b>, enclosed by the dotted line in FIG. 5, resonator <b>505</b>, capacitors <b>510</b>-<b>512</b>, and resistors <b>520</b>-<b>522</b>. Integrated circuit IC<b>10</b> is also preferably a CD74HCU04E hex inverter available from Harris Semiconductor. Four of the six inverters in IC<b>10</b> are not used in this application, and their inputs, pins <b>1</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>5</b> and <b>9</b>, are connected to ground. Pin <b>11</b> of IC<b>10</b> is connected to pin <b>10</b> through resistor <b>521</b>, and pin <b>10</b> is connected to pin <b>13</b>. Pins <b>10</b> and <b>13</b> are also connected to node <b>507</b> through resistor <b>520</b>. Resonator <b>505</b> is connected between pin <b>11</b> and node <b>507</b>. Pin <b>11</b> is also connected to ground through capacitor <b>510</b>, and node <b>507</b> is connected to ground through capacitor <b>511</b>. Pin <b>14</b> is connected to the No. <b>7</b> pin of connector J<b>2</b> through resistor <b>522</b> and to ground through capacitor <b>512</b>, which again represents the VCC and ground connections of all the inverters in the integrated circuit. Pin <b>12</b> provides the output of oscillator <b>114</b> on line <b>177</b>. Resonator <b>505</b> is preferably a 640 kHz ceramic resonator available from Panasonic.</p>
    <p>FIG. 6 shows the detailed circuit diagram of divider <b>116</b>. Divider <b>116</b> comprises integrated circuit IC<b>9</b>, which is preferably a 74HC393 dual 4-bit binary counter available from Harris Semiconductor. Other components of the circuit of FIG.1 are also shown in FIG. 6 for ease of reference. Connector/jumper <b>128</b> is preferably a Berg <b>3</b> pin connector together with a Berg jumper. Pin <b>1</b> of IC<b>9</b> is connected to node <b>178</b>, which carries the output signal from oscillator <b>114</b>. Pins <b>2</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>12</b> are grounded. Pin <b>14</b> is connected to the power source line <b>168</b>. Pin <b>13</b> is connected to the output line <b>182</b> of connector/jumper <b>128</b>. Pin <b>8</b> provides the clock output signal to latch <b>124</b> and buffer <b>126</b> on line <b>184</b>. Pin <b>5</b> is connected to one input, pin <b>20</b>, of connector/jumper <b>128</b>, and pin <b>6</b> is connected to the other input, pin <b>10</b>, of the jumper and also provides the 40 kHz clock signal on line <b>170</b>. Pin <b>10</b> is connected to the line <b>183</b> which provides the clock signal to shift register <b>122</b>. As is known in the art, the symbols on the inside of the rectangle <b>116</b> representing IC<b>9</b> are the signals on the respective pins. These are shown for IC<b>9</b> and for other integrated circuits discussed below to assist those skilled in the art to more easily understand the functions of these circuits.</p>
    <p>As indicated above, the basic clock cycles originate from a ceramic resonator <b>505</b> which resonates at 640 khz. Both IC<b>10</b> and IC<b>9</b> are CMOS integrated circuits. Capacitor <b>131</b> and resistors <b>140</b> and <b>141</b> couple the output of oscillator <b>114</b> to the clock input of IC<b>9</b> at an average voltage midway between the rails of IC<b>9</b>. IC<b>9</b> contains two independent four-stage binary counters. The output of the first counter provides an output cycle on pin <b>5</b> for every eight cycles of resonator <b>505</b> to produce the 80 kHz clock signal and an output cycle on pin <b>6</b> for every sixteen cycles of resonator <b>505</b> to produce the 40 kHz clock signal. Whichever signal is selected by connector/jumper <b>128</b>, is fed back into the second binary counter via pin <b>13</b>. The second binary counter provides an output cycle on pin <b>10</b> for every four cycles on pin <b>13</b>, which output cycle clocks shift register <b>122</b>, and an output cycle on pin <b>8</b> for every sixteen cycle on pin <b>13</b>, which cycle drives the interrupt buffer in IC<b>13</b> (FIG. 7) and clocks the latch IC<b>12</b> (FIG. <b>7</b>).</p>
    <p>The remainder of the normal amplitude portion <b>109</b> of RNG circuit <b>100</b> is shown in FIG. <b>7</b>. This portion of the circuit <b>100</b> includes shift register <b>118</b>, randomness defect reducer <b>120</b>, shift register <b>122</b>, latch <b>124</b>, and buffer <b>126</b>. Other elements of the circuit of FIG. 1 are also shown in FIG. 7 for ease of reference. Shift register <b>118</b> preferably comprises an integrated circuit IC<b>7</b> and shift register <b>122</b> is preferably an integrated circuit IC<b>1</b> <b>1</b>, both of which are preferably a CD74HC16<b>4</b>E, a serial-in/parallel-out shift register available from Harris Semiconductor. In the configuration shown, both are essentially serial-to-parallel converters. Randomness defect reducer <b>120</b> is preferably an integrated circuit IC<b>8</b>, which is preferably a CD74HC86E, a quad 2-input EXCLUSIVE OR gate available from Harris Semiconductor. Latch <b>124</b> is preferably an integrated circuit IC<b>12</b>, which is preferably a CD74HC175E quad D-type flip-flop with clear, and is also available from Harris Semiconductor. Buffer <b>126</b> is preferably an integrated circuit IC<b>13</b>, which is preferably a CD74HC14E hex inverting Schmidt trigger available from Harris Semiconductor.</p>
    <p>Pin <b>1</b> of IC<b>7</b> is connected to node <b>176</b> which carries the output signal from analog to binary converter <b>110</b>. Pins <b>14</b>, <b>9</b> and <b>2</b> are connected together and to the power source line <b>168</b>. Pin <b>8</b> is connected to the output of connector/jumper <b>128</b> via line <b>182</b>, and pin <b>7</b> is grounded. Pins <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b> of IC <b>7</b> provide the 4-bit output of shift register <b>118</b> and are connected to pins <b>13</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>10</b>, and <b>9</b>, respectively, of IC<b>8</b>, which are the inputs to XOR gates <b>710</b> and <b>712</b>. Pin <b>14</b> of IC<b>8</b> is connected to power source line <b>168</b>, and pin <b>7</b> is grounded. Pins <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> are also connected to line <b>168</b>, which holds one XOR gate in IC<b>8</b>, which gate is not used, in a static state when the circuit is on. Pins <b>11</b> and <b>8</b>, which are the outputs of XOR gates <b>710</b> and <b>712</b>, respectively, are connected to pins <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, which are the inputs of XOR gate <b>714</b>. Pin <b>6</b> of IC <b>8</b> is the output of XOR gate <b>714</b> and randomness defect reducer <b>120</b> and is connected to pin <b>1</b>, the data input, of IC<b>11</b>. Pins <b>14</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>9</b> of IC<b>11</b> are connected to power source line <b>168</b>, and pin <b>7</b> is grounded. Pin <b>8</b>, the clock input, is connected to pin <b>10</b> of divider <b>116</b> via line <b>183</b>. Pins <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b> provide the outputs of shift register <b>122</b> on which the 4-bit output word of the RNG circuit <b>100</b> is output to pins <b>5</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>12</b>, respectively, of latch <b>124</b>, IC<b>12</b>. Pins <b>1</b> and <b>16</b> of IC<b>12</b> are connected to the power source line <b>168</b>, and pin <b>8</b> is grounded. Pin <b>9</b>, the clock input of IC<b>12</b>, is connected to pin <b>8</b> of IC<b>9</b> via line <b>184</b>. Pins <b>6</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>10</b> of IC<b>12</b> provide the latched output of IC<b>12</b> and are connected to pins <b>5</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>1</b>, and <b>13</b> of buffer <b>126</b>, IC<b>13</b>, respectively. Pin <b>14</b> of IC<b>13</b> is connected to power line <b>192</b> and pin <b>7</b> is grounded. As usual, these connections to interrupt signal driver <b>721</b> reflect the same connections to interrupt signal driver <b>720</b> and the bit drivers <b>722</b> through <b>725</b>. Pin <b>11</b> of IC<b>13</b>, the input to the interrupt circuit comprising drivers <b>720</b> and <b>721</b>, is connected to the clock output pin <b>8</b> of IC<b>9</b> via line <b>184</b>. Pin <b>8</b> of IC<b>13</b> provides the interrupt signal and is connected to the No. <b>10</b> pin of connector J<b>2</b>. Pins <b>6</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>12</b> of IC<b>13</b> provide the outputs for the four bits of the random sequence word output by RNG circuit <b>100</b> and are connected to the No. <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, and <b>15</b> pins of connector J<b>2</b>, respectively.</p>
    <p>Capacitor <b>132</b> and resistors <b>140</b> and <b>142</b> AC couple the output of IC<b>4</b> (FIG. 4) to the DATA input of IC<b>7</b> (FIG. 7) at an average voltage midway between the rails of IC<b>7</b>. The signal into the clock input, pin <b>8</b>, of IC<b>7</b> is 80 khz if the jumper <b>129</b> of connector/jumper <b>128</b> is in the position shown by the solid line in FIGS. 1 and 6, and is 40 kHz if the jumper <b>129</b>′ is in the position shown by the dotted line.</p>
    <p>The selection of the clock frequency of the shift register <b>118</b>, and thus the sampling frequency of the RNG circuit <b>100</b> is a feature of the invention. The selection of this frequency may be understood more easily by reference to FIG. 14, which shows the logarithm of the absolute value of the measured serial dependence of the adjusted output of analog to binary converter at node <b>176</b> as a function of the delay time between samples in microseconds. As can be seen from the figures, the serial dependence curve at high sample rates, i.e. low delay times, is an essentially logarithimically decreasing curve approximated by line <b>14</b>A. At low sample rates, the serial dependence goes essentially flat, as approximated by line <b>14</b>B. The logarithimically decreasing line arises from the transfer function of the analog circuitry and the nature of the statistics, while the flat, horizontal line is a result of using limited, real components to build the circuit. The dots show the measured values for the preferred embodiment of the invention, which values may depart significantly from the limiting lines <b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B for individual measurement, but overall will be below the limiting curves. A knee is formed in the measured curve at approximately the point where lines <b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B meet. It is a feature of the invention that the sampling frequency is selected to be at or below this knee, i.e. at or below the point of intersection of the logarithimically decreasing statistical curve and the essentially flat real curve, which point of intersection for the circuit <b>100</b> is at a delay time of approximately 12.5 microseconds as indicated by line <b>14</b>C. This delay time converted to sampling frequency gives 80 kHertz. This sampling frequency is optimum because, if a faster sampling frequency is chosen, the serial dependence, and thus the defectiveness in randomness, increases dramatically. If the sampling frequency is chosen to be lower, a lower bit rate is produced with little gain in randomness. For some applications, choosing a sampling frequency about 25% higher than the knee will not produce an unacceptable increase in randomness defects. However, beyond this point, the limiting curve <b>14</b>A increases dramatically above line <b>14</b>B, and therefore indicates significant defects in randomness. Thus, in the preferred embodiment, the sampling rate is chosen to be from a non-zero value that is suitably fast for the computer <b>1104</b> up to a rate that is 125% of the rate at the knee.</p>
    <p>Some computers, especially older, slower ones, cannot easily accept and process random bits at the 20 kHz rate. Thus, the preferred embodiment of the invention provides the option of placing the jumper <b>129</b> in the position <b>129</b>′ in FIGS. 1 and 6, and thus choosing an output bit rate of 10 kHz.</p>
    <p>Assuming a clock rate or 80 kHz is selected, 20,000 times a second, four bits will be clocked into shift register <b>118</b>. These four bits are output to randomness defect reducer <b>120</b>. It is a feature of the invention that randomness defect reducer <b>120</b> comprises two levels of EXCLUSIVE OR functions. A third level is optional; this would reduce the randomness defects even more, but would reduce the rate of production of bits in the random sequence. As will be discussed in detail below, an equation devised by the inventor was used to predict that only two levels of defect correction will provide a random sequence that is acceptable for most users of the RNG. As is known in the art, in an XOR operation the output is “low” when both inputs are either both “high” or both “low”, and the output is “high” when the two inputs are opposite. In the first level of XOR function, the bits on pins <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> of shift register <b>118</b> are XOR'd by gate <b>710</b> and the bits on pins <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> of shift register <b>118</b> are XOR'd by gate <b>712</b>. In the second level of XOR function, the outputs of gates <b>710</b> and <b>712</b> are XOR'd. If the clock input on pin <b>8</b> of shift register <b>118</b> is 80 kHz, a defect-reduced binary random sequence (BRS) at 20,000 bits per second will be produced at pin <b>6</b> of IC<b>8</b>, and if the clock pulse input on pin <b>8</b> of shift register <b>118</b> is 40 kHz, a defect-reduced BRS at 10,000 bits per second will be produced at pin <b>6</b> of IC<b>8</b>.</p>
    <p>The binary random sequence output at pin <b>6</b> of IC<b>8</b> is formatted for transfer to the computer <b>1104</b> (FIG. 11) in shift register <b>122</b>, latch <b>124</b>, and buffer <b>126</b>. Shift register <b>122</b> forms the sequence into 4-bit nibbles, which are latched in latch <b>124</b>. Buffer <b>126</b> isolates the signals on pins <b>10</b>-<b>13</b>, and <b>15</b> of connector J<b>2</b> from the rest of the circuit <b>100</b> and provides the power to drive the capacitance of the parallel connection to computer <b>1104</b>. As indicated above, every sixteen clock cycle on line <b>182</b>, an interrupt signal is generated on pin <b>8</b> of IC<b>9</b> (FIG. <b>6</b>), which signal is buffered in two stages by inverters <b>720</b> and <b>721</b> and output on the No. <b>10</b> pin of connector J<b>2</b>; each time the interrupt signal occurs, a latched signal on the No. <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, and <b>15</b> pins is ready for computer <b>1104</b>.</p>

Preferably, the capacitors discussed above are of the following types and values: capacitor <b>314</b> is a 100 picofarad, 2%, silver-mica capacitor; capacitors <b>131</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>213</b>, <b>510</b> and <b>511</b> are 470 picofarad, 10%, ceramic capacitors; capacitors <b>317</b> and <b>319</b> are 0.10 microfarad, 10%, ceramic capacitors; capacitor <b>411</b> is a 0.22 microfarad, 10% ceramic capacitor; capacitors <b>210</b> and <b>512</b> are 0.47 microfarad, 20%, tantalum, polarized capacitors; capacitors <b>133</b>,<b>134</b>, <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>310</b>-<b>313</b>, <b>315</b>, <b>316</b>, <b>318</b>, <b>320</b>, and <b>412</b> are 4.7 microfarad, 20%, tantalum, polarized capacitors; and capacitor <b>410</b> is a 100 picofarad, 10%, ceramic capacitor.</p>
    <p>FIG. 8 shows the physical layout of RNG circuit <b>100</b> on printed circuit board (PCB) <b>800</b>. This figure is not intended to show the details of the circuit precisely, nor is it intended to be in scale, but is only intended to show the general layout so that several features of the invention become clear. In addition to the various circuit components already discussed, the PCB includes traces <b>801</b>, which are shown in dashed outline to indicate that they are physically on the reverse side of the circuit board from the component side that is uppermost in the figure. The integrated circuits IC<b>1</b> through IC<b>13</b> are shown approximately in the positions they are located on PCB <b>800</b> so that the relative locations of the various portions of the circuit can be seen. Importantly, the low amplitude <b>101</b> of the circuit <b>100</b> is separate from the normal amplitude portion <b>109</b>. On the reverse side, the low amplitude portion is nearly surrounded by a ground plane <b>802</b>, which is broken only in a small channel <b>804</b> through which traces <b>806</b> pass to connect to the normal amplitude portion <b>109</b> of circuit <b>100</b>. Four holes <b>820</b> are formed in PCB board to pass bolts <b>910</b> (FIG. <b>9</b>).</p>
    <p>As will be seen below, these features facilitate the shielding of low amplitude portion <b>101</b>. Connector J<b>2</b> is located at one end <b>812</b> of circuit board <b>802</b>, which facilitates a simple connection of the circuit <b>100</b> to a computer <b>1104</b> (FIG. <b>11</b>). Circuit board <b>800</b> and traces <b>801</b> are made of conventional materials as is known in the art.</p>
    <p>FIG. 9 shows the analog end <b>814</b> of PCB <b>800</b> with the cover portions of electromagnetic interference (EMI) shield <b>900</b> about to be bolted in place. Shield <b>900</b> preferably includes a component side cover <b>902</b>, a solder side cover <b>904</b>, four bolts <b>910</b>, four nuts <b>912</b>, and ground plane <b>802</b> (FIG. <b>8</b>). Preferably, the component side cover <b>902</b> is deeper than the solder side cover <b>904</b> to provide room for the components. Preferably, component side cover <b>902</b> is about 0.30 inches deep and the solder side cover <b>904</b> is about 0.090 inches deep. Both covers include a flange <b>920</b> and <b>921</b> which has four holes <b>924</b> formed in it. The holes <b>924</b> pass bolts <b>910</b>. Flanges <b>920</b> and <b>921</b> also intercept any EMI that could otherwise fringe through the gap <b>1010</b> (FIG. 10) between the covers <b>902</b> and <b>904</b> due to the thickness of circuit board <b>800</b>. The circuit board <b>800</b> is thin, preferably about 0.062 inches thick. Preferably, each of flanges <b>920</b> and <b>921</b> are about 0.25 inches wide. Covers <b>902</b> and <b>904</b> are preferably stamped from about 0.025 inch thick steel or other suitable ferromagnetic material. Bolts <b>910</b> and nuts <b>912</b> are also made of a ferromagnetic material. FIG. 10 shows a cross-section through lines <b>10</b>—<b>10</b> in FIG. 9, which passes through the flanges <b>920</b> and <b>921</b> of covers <b>902</b> and <b>904</b>. As can be seen in this figure, flange <b>921</b> includes a dimpled portion <b>1020</b> which is offset from the rest of flange <b>921</b> in a direction away from the open side <b>930</b> of cover <b>904</b>. Dimpled portion <b>1020</b> forms a channel <b>1022</b> between the flange <b>921</b> and PCB <b>800</b> through which traces <b>801</b> pass. The offset of dimpled portion <b>1020</b> is preferably about 0.015 inches. When covers <b>902</b> and <b>904</b> are firmly bolted in place about low amplitude portion <b>101</b> of circuit <b>100</b>, both covers <b>902</b> and <b>904</b> are grounded to ground plane <b>802</b>. As described above, shield <b>900</b> protects the low amplitude portion <b>101</b> of circuit <b>100</b> from both electrostatic and electromagnetic interference.</p>
    <p>FIG. 11 shows a preferred embodiment of a complete random number generator system <b>1100</b> according to the invention. It includes an electronic module <b>1102</b>, a computer <b>1104</b> which includes software for interfacing with module <b>1102</b>, and a connecting cable <b>1106</b>. Module <b>1102</b> includes a housing <b>1110</b> and circuit <b>100</b> mounted on a circuit board <b>800</b>, the latter two of which have just been discussed in detail. Housing <b>1110</b> includes a box-like housing body <b>1112</b>, end plates <b>1114</b> and <b>1115</b>, and four bolts <b>1116</b>. Housing body <b>1112</b> is a molded rectangular cylinder having open ends <b>1118</b>, grooves <b>1122</b> within which the side ends <b>1123</b> of PCB <b>800</b> slide, and threaded bores <b>1124</b>. Plates <b>1114</b> and <b>1115</b> are shaped to cover the ends <b>1118</b> and <b>1119</b> of housing body <b>1112</b> and each have two holes <b>1130</b> passing bolts <b>1116</b>. Plate <b>1114</b> has an opening <b>1132</b> shaped to accept the distal end <b>1133</b> of connector <b>102</b> including a pair of bolts <b>1134</b>, each of which includes an enlarged head having a threaded bore <b>1136</b>. Module <b>1102</b> is assembled by attaching plate <b>1115</b> to end <b>1119</b> of housing body <b>1112</b> using bolts, such as <b>1116</b>, inserting the end <b>1133</b> of connector <b>102</b> through opening <b>1132</b>, screwing bolts <b>1134</b> into threaded bores (not shown) in connector <b>102</b> to attach plate <b>1114</b> to the connector <b>102</b>, slipping PCB <b>800</b> into grooves <b>1122</b> until plate <b>1114</b> is flush against the end <b>1118</b> of housing body <b>1112</b>, inserting bolts <b>1116</b> through holes <b>1130</b>, and screwing them into bores <b>1124</b> to close the end <b>1118</b> of housing body <b>1112</b> and secure the plate <b>1114</b> to the housing body. Housing body <b>1112</b> and end plates <b>1114</b> and <b>1115</b> are preferably made of aluminum or other easily moldable material, though any suitable metal or other material may be used.</p>
    <p>Connecting cable <b>1106</b> includes a wire cable portion <b>1140</b> and a pair of connectors, <b>1142</b> and <b>1169</b>, one attached to either end of cable portion <b>1140</b>. Connector <b>1142</b> has a distal engaging portion <b>1144</b> with <b>25</b> pins (not shown) that fit into female pin receptacles <b>1145</b> in connector <b>102</b>. Connector <b>1142</b> also includes threaded rods <b>1146</b> which screw into bores <b>1136</b> in the heads of bolts <b>1134</b> to secure the connector <b>1142</b> to mating connector <b>102</b>. The connectors <b>102</b> and <b>1142</b> are conventional and their design and operation are well-known to anyone familiar with personal computers, thus they need not be discussed in greater detail. In fact, it is a feature of the invention that RNG module <b>1102</b> may be connected to any personal computer <b>1104</b> using the standard parallel port connecting cable <b>1106</b>.</p>
    <p>In the preferred embodiment, computer <b>1104</b> is a conventional personal computer, such as any IBM compatible PC, but also may be an Apple brand computer, a work station, a mini-computer, a main frame computer, or any other computer capable of interacting with a peripheral. In FIG. 11, computer <b>1104</b> is shown with its case <b>1190</b> partially cut away to expose internal components. As known in the art, PC <b>1104</b> includes parallel port <b>1150</b>, an input means, which is typically a keyboard <b>1160</b>, but also may be a modem or other device, an output means, which typically is a display <b>1162</b>, but also may be a printer, modem, or other device, a memory <b>1163</b>, which typically includes a RAM <b>1164</b>, a hard disk <b>1165</b>, and a floppy disk <b>1166</b>, a central processing unit (CPU) <b>1168</b>, and a motherboard <b>1170</b> that typically includes a self-contained memory <b>1620</b> (FIG. 16) called a bios. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 11, parallel port <b>1150</b> provides a power source for the random noise generator circuit <b>100</b>. As known in the art, ultimately, the power comes from an AC source or a battery (not shown). Since PC's are well-known, there is no need to discuss the details further.</p>
    <p>Memory <b>1163</b> includes software that is designed to interface with RNG module <b>1102</b> to operate it, retrieve the sequences of bits generated by it, and to make them available to applications programs. A functional block diagram illustrating an example of such software is shown in FIG. <b>12</b>A. This illustration is of a device driver, which is a type of software well-known in the computer art. The device driver software <b>1200</b> includes two parts: an interrupt handler portion <b>1202</b> and a command processor portion <b>1204</b>. The two portions interact via a memory buffer <b>1206</b>, which the software <b>1200</b> sets up in the computer memory <b>1163</b> to store the random sequence of bits produced by RNG module <b>1102</b>, and another portion <b>1208</b> of the memory <b>1163</b> in which functional test data is stored. Memory buffer <b>1206</b> is preferably set up in RAM <b>1164</b>. The interrupt handler software also interacts with RNG module <b>1102</b>, while the command processor software <b>1204</b> interacts with the computer I/O system <b>1220</b>, which generally is part of the operating system of the computer, and one or more applications programs <b>1222</b> which provide the interface to the RNG user. In FIG. 12A data flow paths are indicated by double-lined arrows, such as <b>1212</b> while program calls are indicated by single-line arrows, such as <b>1214</b>.</p>
    <p>The flow chart for the preferred embodiment of the interrupt handler portion <b>1202</b> of the software <b>1200</b> is shown at the left in FIG. 12A within the interrupt handler box <b>1202</b>. As discussed above, when RNG module <b>1102</b> has a four-bit word ready for transmission, it provides an interrupt on pin <b>10</b> of parallel port <b>1150</b>. Upon receipt of this interrupt, the interrupt handler software <b>1202</b> reads the data from the RNG module, then packs it into a 16 bit word, which is then stored in memory buffer <b>1206</b>, if the memory buffer is not full. The word is also added to the test data which is stored at a designated location in the memory <b>1163</b>. The interrupt is then dismissed.</p>
    <p>The command processor software <b>1204</b> comprises five functions: an initialization routine <b>1224</b>, an open file enable interrupt function <b>1225</b>, a read data routine <b>1226</b>, a write mode function <b>1227</b>, and a close file disable interrupt function <b>1228</b>. The details of the initialization routine <b>1204</b> are given in FIGS. 12B and 12C, while the details of the other functions are given in FIG. <b>12</b>D. The initialization routine <b>1224</b> is called from the I/O system software <b>1220</b> on bootup of the computer <b>1104</b>. The “open file” enable interrupt is called from the applications program <b>1222</b>, usually when the applications program is opened, though it may be called only when a random number generator function is activated in the applications program. The read data function <b>1226</b> is called from the applications program when the applications program requires a sequence of random numbers or some other form of a random sequence, or when the applications program asks for test data. At that time the read data function <b>1226</b> provides a random sequence from memory buffer <b>1206</b> in the operating mode format set up with the write mode function <b>1227</b> or test data if the applications program is calling for such. The write mode function <b>1227</b> receives a call from the applications program when the user opens the set-up function of the applications program. The “close file” function is called from the applications program, usually when the program is exited, but may be called when the random number generator function of the applications program is exited.</p>
    <p>Turning to FIGS. 12B and 12C, a flow chart of the preferred embodiment of the initialization routine <b>1224</b> is shown. This embodiment is for an IBM compatible PC. As is normal for device drivers, the initialization routine is entered each time the computer <b>1104</b> is booted up. Both a 386/486/Pentium version of the device driver, hereinafter referred to as the “386” version, and an 8086/286 version of the device driver are included on the disk from which the software is installed, and the install program determines the type of CPU and loads the proper device driver. Steps <b>1230</b> and <b>1231</b> check to make sure that a version of the device driver that the computer can handle is installed. In step <b>1230</b> the software interrogates the CPU and checks to see if it is a <b>8086</b> or <b>286</b> processor, and if not, loads the device driver and shows the “driver loaded” message on the display in step <b>1233</b>. If the CPU is a <b>8086</b> or <b>286</b>, then there could be a compatibility problem, so the program goes to step <b>1231</b> to see if the <b>386</b> version of the driver is installed. If it is, the software provides an error return and does not load the driver, since an <b>8086</b> or <b>286</b> cannot handle the <b>386</b> version of the driver. If it is not, then the program completes step <b>1233</b> and proceeds to step <b>1234</b>. In the install program, the user has the option of bypassing the auto detect logic (see below) and direct the driver to utilize a specific port and interrupt number by including this information in a DEVICE command. If the user has chosen this alternative, step <b>1234</b> passes the program control to step <b>1236</b> in which the port and interrupt number specified by the user are set up. The program control then proceeds to FIG. 12C at the point “B”.</p>
    <p>If the user has not specified a particular port and interrupt number, an auto-detect routine <b>1237</b> is entered. This routine automatically locates the port to which the module <b>1102</b> is connected and the interrupt it is using, provided the port is one of the three standard printer ports, i.e. device codes <b>3</b>BC, <b>378</b>, or <b>278</b>, and the interrupt is one of the standard printer interrupts, i.e. INT <b>5</b> or INT <b>7</b>. If no interrupt is detected, the device driver <b>1200</b> will operate in polling mode, which is a standard no interrupt mode. In step <b>1238</b> the software finds the number of parallel ports installed, turns on the power to each, and waits for 1 second to allow the RNG module <b>1102</b> to warm up. Then, in step <b>1239</b>, the data rate and serial correlation on each port is measured in polling mode. In step <b>1240</b>, the software then rejects ports with a data rate of less than 9200 bits per second or with a serial correlation, X<sup>2</sup>, of less than 0.0002 or greater than 6.553. The software does this step three times to try to get good serial correlation. If no port passes these tests, then in step <b>1242</b> an error message is displayed and the driver is unloaded. If a port does pass the test, then the device code of the port that passed is set up in step <b>1244</b>; if more than one port passes then the ports are listed in the order <b>3</b>BC, <b>378</b>, and <b>278</b>, and the last port on the list is used, since the <b>278</b> port usually will avoid conflicts best with software systems such as WINDOWS™, and the <b>378</b> is next best. The program control then passes to the steps shown in FIG. 12C at point “A”.</p>
    <p>In step <b>1246</b> temporary interrupt handlers for INT <b>5</b> and INT <b>7</b> are set up and the interrupts are enabled. The temporary interrupt handlers are designed to properly count the transitions so that the following test works. The program pauses for a quarter second in step <b>1247</b> and then counts the transitions seen in poll mode and the transitions seen by the temporary INT <b>5</b> handler and the temporary INT <b>7</b> handler. Then, in step <b>1249</b>, the temporary interrupt handlers are disabled and the normal interrupt handlers for INT <b>5</b> and INT <b>7</b> are restored. At the same time the number of transitions seen on each of the temporary interrupts are compared to the number of transitions seen in poll mode. If the number of transitions seen by the temporary INT <b>5</b> handler is within ±20 counts of the number of transitions seen in poll mode, the program control goes to the right at decision tree <b>1250</b> and the interrupt number is set to <b>5</b> in step <b>1256</b>. If the number of transitions seen by the temporary INT <b>5</b> handler is not within ±20 counts of the number of transitions seen in poll mode, the program control goes down in step <b>1250</b>. In step <b>1252</b>, if the number of transitions seen by the temporary INT <b>7</b> handler is within ±20 counts of the number of transitions seen in poll mode, the program control goes to the right and the interrupt number is set to 7 in step <b>1256</b>. If the number of transitions seen by the temporary INT <b>7</b> handler is not within ±20 counts of the number of transitions seen in poll mode, the program control goes down to step <b>1253</b> where the mode is set to polling mode, with no interrupts used. From steps <b>1256</b> and <b>1257</b>, or if the device code was set by the user (FIG. <b>12</b>B), then, in step <b>1259</b>, the interrupt vector is set to the handler actually used. From both steps <b>1253</b> and <b>1259</b>, the program proceeds to set up the amount of memory needed by the selected driver's resident routines, including setting up the memory buffer <b>1206</b>, and the program control then returns to the disk operating system (DOS).</p>
    <p>A flow chart of the preferred routine <b>1260</b> for performing the open file, read data, write mode, and close file functions, i.e. functions <b>1225</b>-<b>1228</b> in FIG. 12A, is shown in FIG. <b>12</b>D. In step <b>1261</b> the routine checks to see if an open file call is being placed by the applications program <b>1222</b>, and if so, it proceeds to step <b>1262</b> where it clears the memory buffer <b>1206</b> and test data buffer <b>1208</b>, then to step <b>1263</b> where it enables the interrupt and then program control returns to where it left the operating system or applications program. If no open file call is being made made, then the program control passes to step <b>1264</b>, where the routine checks to see if a close file call is being made by the applications program <b>1222</b>. If so, the program control goes to step <b>1265</b> where it disables the interrupt then returns to the operating or applications program.</p>
    <p>If no close file call is being made from the applications program <b>1222</b>, then the program control passes through to step <b>1267</b> where the routine <b>1260</b> checks to see if a write mode call has been made from the applications program <b>1222</b>. If so, the routine goes to step <b>1268</b> where it accepts a mode setup command from the applications program and sets the operating mode. Modes available by use of a mode operating command are: uniform 16-bit mode, uniform 32-bit mode, normal-signed mode, normal-unsigned mode, basic hex mode, and validity check mode. The uniform 16-bit mode provides uniformly distributed floating point numbers between 0 and +1; 1.0 is not included in this range. Each number is a six-digit number preceded by a decimal point and followed by a newline character. Not all 6 digits are significant because the values are derived from 16-bit integers. Uniform 32-bit mode is the same as uniform 16-bit mode except the numbers are derived from 32-bit integers and nine digits are returned for each value. Normal-signed mode returns normally distributed values based on 32-bit integers. The range is arbitrarily limited to ±8.0 standard deviations, though this limit would not be reached in normal use. Each value is followed by a newline character. The normal-unsigned mode is the same as normal-signed except the values are normally distributed between 0 and +8.0. Basic hex mode returns a stream of ASCII hex digits, each representing a 4-bit random integer. No decimal points or newline characters are appended. Validity check mode runs a basic validity check on the bit stream received from the RNG module <b>1102</b>. Each time this command is called, the device driver <b>1200</b> returns to the applications program <b>1222</b> a line of text containing: the bit count, i.e. the number of bits received since the last call; the number of excess 1's; and the first order serial correlation in parts per million. The default mode is signed normal mode. The device driver will normally reset to the default mode each time it is opened, i.e. each time the computer is turned on. However, an additional “hard” mode setup command overrides this reset function and prevents resetting of the mode to the default mode when the device driver is opened. If this hard mode command is called, the device driver opens in the last requested operating mode each time the computer is turned on.</p>
    <p>After the operating mode is set, the program returns to the applications program or operating system. If no write mode call is being made, the routine <b>1260</b> goes to step <b>1270</b> in which it checks to see if a read data call is being made. If no call for data is being made, the program control returns to the applications program or operating system. If a read data call is being made, the routine <b>1260</b> checks in step <b>1272</b> to see if there is data in the memory buffer <b>1206</b>, and if there isn't cycles through step <b>1274</b> back to step <b>1272</b> for a tenth of a second. If there is still no data in buffer <b>1206</b>, an error message is returned to the calling program, and program control returns to the applications program or operating system. If there is data in buffer <b>1206</b>, the routine <b>1260</b> gets the data word or words. The applications program may request a single word at a time or a specified number of words. The routine then proceeds to step <b>1280</b> where it checks to see if the mode set in step <b>1268</b> requires a normal distribution. If so, it proceeds to step <b>1282</b> where the data number is converted to normal distribution. After conversion, or if no normal distribution is required, the routine goes to step <b>1284</b> where the data is arranged in the output format as specified above. The data is then returned to the calling program in step <b>1286</b>, and the program control returns to the operating system <b>1220</b> or applications program <b>1222</b>. If the applications program <b>1222</b> requests data at a rate lower than the rate at which the RNG module <b>1102</b> provides the data, i.e. at a rate lower than the 10,000 bits per second or 20,000 bits per second selectable with connector/jumper <b>128</b>, the extra samples are discarded. If the applications program <b>1222</b> requests data at a higher rate, the driver will cause the applications program to wait until the data becomes available.</p>
    <p>As can be seen from the above, the applications program <b>1222</b> communicates with the RNG module <b>1102</b> via the device driver. The device driver software <b>1200</b> is preferably part of the operating system of the computer and is typically stored on the hard disk <b>1165</b>. As indicated above, the device driver software is initiated along with the operating system each time the computer <b>1104</b> is turned on. Thus, once the module <b>1102</b> is connected to the parallel port and the device driver is installed, the RNG system <b>1100</b> for the most part operates transparently.</p>
    <p>The above-described interface software <b>1200</b> illustrates but one of many device driver interfaces that may be devised. For example, one skilled in the art will recognize that the device driver can be designed to offer options of returning the random sequence in other modes than those discussed above. As known in the art, an almost limitless number of different distributions can be devised. The application program to which the binary random sequence is sent may use the sequence in many ways. It can use the bits directly as provided or convert it to another form not provided by the device driver.</p>
    <p>The use of a device driver as the interface is a feature of the invention. It permits the RNG module <b>1102</b> to be tested automatically each time the computer <b>1104</b> is turned on, and allows the applications to be set up in a format computer users are familiar with, such as pop-up menus, icons, mice, etc. Many other interfaces with the circuit <b>100</b> are possible. For example, the interface may be incorporated into an application program, a program intermediate between operating system programs and applications, such as Windows™, a program placed in a bios <b>1620</b> on a memory board <b>1600</b> (FIG. <b>16</b>), wired into firmware, or designed in any other way that computer peripherals may be interfaced with. Interfaces other than a device driver may also be used. For example, the interface may be in a terminate-and-stay-resident program, commonly called a TSR, or may be in some portion of the operating system other than a device driver.</p>
    <p>The software that is provided with the RNG system <b>1100</b> also includes a test program that tests the following properties of the system: the data rate; which interrupts are in use, if any; whether the module <b>1102</b> is activating more than 1 interrupt; whether the interrupt occurs on the rising or falling edge of the clock, which affects the amount of time available to process an interrupt; the one/zero balance of the output data; the bit serial correlation of the output data, providing first order through the eight order results; “monkey” tests; and entropy tests. The test program also provides a graphic display of the number distribution.</p>
    <p>It is a feature of the invention that the RNG module <b>1102</b> connects directly to the parallel port <b>1150</b> of a computer <b>1104</b>. No separate power supply and associated power cord is required. This greatly simplifies the installation and use of the module <b>1102</b>. Once installed, the hardware becomes transparent, and the user is aware of it only through the interface software. However, other ways of incorporating the hardware into a computer system may be used. Two alternative embodiments are shown in FIGS. 15 and 16. In FIG. 15, the RNG circuit <b>1510</b> is mounted on an add-on board <b>1502</b> that installs in case <b>1190</b> of computer <b>1104</b>. As known in the PC art, in this embodiment, connector <b>1510</b> replaces connector J<b>2</b> of the embodiment of FIG. <b>1</b> and plugs directly into the bus of the computer <b>1104</b>. In this embodiment, the power source for RNG circuit <b>1510</b> comprises certain ones of pins <b>1520</b> that connect to the power bus. The circuit <b>1510</b> may be the same as the circuit of the embodiment of FIG. 1, except since the power supply will usually come directly from the computer power supply through pins <b>1520</b>, the low power components may be replaced by equivalent components that use more power, and the digital circuits that directly interface with the bus will be designed to transfer words of 16, 32 or more bits in length, as is well-known to one skilled in the computer art. Circuit <b>1510</b> also contains an analog portion <b>1501</b> and a digital portion <b>1509</b>, and the analog portion is shielded with shield <b>1530</b>. In the embodiment of FIG. 16, the RNG circuit <b>1610</b> is mounted on the motherboard <b>1600</b> of a PC. The circuit <b>1610</b> is equivalent to the circuit <b>1510</b> of the previous embodiment, including an analog portion <b>1601</b> protected by shield <b>1630</b>, and a digital portion <b>1609</b>. However, in this embodiment, digital portion <b>1609</b> is fabricated on a single integrated circuit chip <b>1609</b>, and the power source of the RNG circuit <b>1610</b> comprises the motherboard power source, i.e. power connectors, such as <b>1630</b>, which connect to a regulated DC power source (not shown) as known in the art.</p>
    <p>FIG. 17 shows a partially block diagram of an alternative preferred embodiment of an RNG circuit <b>1700</b> that can replace a portion of either circuit <b>100</b> in the embodiment of FIG.1, circuit <b>1510</b> of the embodiment of FIG. 15, or circuit <b>1610</b> of the embodiment of FIG. <b>16</b>. RNG circuit <b>1700</b> includes a source <b>1702</b> of intrinsically random pulses caused by quantum events, a signal conditioner <b>1704</b>, and a randomness defect reducer <b>1706</b>. In the preferred embodiment the intrinsically random quantum source <b>1702</b> comprises a nuclear source <b>1703</b> and a nuclear decay detector <b>1708</b> that is adjacent to nuclear source <b>1703</b>. However, it also could be any other intrinsically random quantum source, such as a quantum noise in a stream of photons. Nuclear source <b>1703</b> preferably is similar to the americium source used in smoke detectors. Since the output of quantum source <b>1702</b> is a pulse, an analog to binary converter is not necessary in this embodiment. Signal conditioner <b>1704</b> transforms the pulse <b>1720</b> output by source <b>1702</b> to a signal that is of essentially the same voltage as the signal on output <b>175</b> of analog to binary converter of the embodiment of FIG. <b>1</b>. In the RNG circuit <b>1700</b>, a different randomness defect reducer <b>1706</b> is used. In this embodiment, randomness defect reducer <b>1706</b> preferably comprises a 74HC74 divider <b>1710</b> available from Harris Semiconductor. As in the embodiment of FIG. 1, the signal at line <b>1775</b> is adjusted by capacitor <b>1731</b> and resistors <b>1740</b> and <b>1741</b>. Line <b>1775</b> is connected to node <b>1776</b> through capacitor <b>1731</b>. Node <b>1776</b> is connected to ground through resistor <b>1740</b>, to power source line <b>1768</b>, which is equivalent to line <b>168</b> in FIG. 1, through resistor <b>1741</b>, and to pin <b>3</b> of divider <b>1710</b>, which is the data input to divider <b>1710</b>. Power source line <b>1768</b> is also connected to pins <b>1</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>10</b>-<b>14</b> of divider <b>1710</b>. Pin <b>7</b> of divider <b>1710</b> is grounded and pins <b>6</b> and <b>2</b> are connected. Preferably, capacitor <b>1731</b> and resistors <b>1740</b> and <b>1741</b> have the same values as capacitor <b>131</b> and resistors <b>140</b> and <b>141</b>, respectively, of the embodiment of FIG. <b>1</b>.</p>
    <p>In the above configuration, the 74HC74 chip becomes a divide by 2 divider. The output may be provided to pin <b>1</b> of a shift register such as IC<b>11</b> in FIG. 7, and the rest of the circuit <b>1700</b> is then the same as the rest of circuit <b>100</b> shown in FIGS. 1 and 7. The use of a divider as a randomness defect reducer is particularly effective in combination with random signal sources that derive from discrete random events, such as nuclear decay, since such a divider reduces the one/zero bias, which is the principal source of randomness defects in such discrete event sources. However, it also may be used with sources such as the white noise resistor <b>300</b> of the embodiment of FIG. <b>1</b>. In this case the divider is configured to switch on positive transitions.</p>
    <p>A key factor in the development of the invention, was the discovery of the ability to predict the randomness quality of the RNG system <b>1100</b>. How this is done may perhaps be understood best by starting with fundamental principals of statistics related to binary random sequences (BRS). A BRS can be described statistically by two fundamental properties: 1) SD(t), the serial dependence as a function of delay time, that is, the dependence of the value for a binary pulse on the values of the binary pulses adjacent to it in a serial sequence as a function of the time between pulses; and 2) p(x), where x=0 or 1, the average probability of a “0” or “1” occurring in the BRS.</p>
    <p>A truly random sequence is defined by SD(t)=0 for all t and p(<b>1</b>)=0.50 as N→∞, where N=the number of bits. In practical terms, N cannot be infinite so, a real BRS is instead defined in terms of probability confidence levels. Every real system used to generate random numbers has physical constraints which create imperfections which, without correction, produce an unacceptable level of defect in the BRS statistics. The primary defects can be accounted for as defects in the SD(t) and in a derived measure related to p(<b>1</b>) and given in equation (3) above, i.e.:</p>
    <p>
      <maths> <formula-text> <i>B</i> <sub>2</sub>=[N(<b>1</b>)−0.5N]/0.5N,  (3)</formula-text> </maths> </p>
    <p>where N(<b>1</b>) is the number of 1's in a binary random sequence of length N. B<sub>2 </sub>is a fractional expression of the excess 1's in the sequence. B<sub>2 </sub>varies between −1 for a BRS of all 0's and +1 for a BRS of all 1's. with B<sub>2</sub>=0 being the same condition as p(<b>1</b>)=0.5.</p>
    <p>It was recognized that if the defects in a real system could be reduced in a predictable manner so as to produce a BRS having statistics suitable for any particular application, then optimum RNG's could be developed, which had acceptable levels of defects for the application, and which were as fast as possible for the application. It is also important to be able to predict the BRS statistics from quickly measurable parameters to avoid the years of verification testing that would otherwise be necessary. It was further recognized that defects could be reduced by using one or more levels of XOR operations, where, in each level, non-overlapping pairs of consecutive bits in the BRS are taken as the inputs of the XOR to produce a single output bit in a new sequence, BRS*, having half the bit rate as the original sequence. The new sequence may be treated in the same way to produce a further sequence, BRS**, at one-fourth the bit rate as the original rate. The output statistics from each level of XOR operation are related to the statistics of the input sequence by the equations:</p>
    <p>
      <maths> <formula-text> <i>B</i> <sub>2</sub> <i>*=−SD</i>(<b>1</b>); and  (1)</formula-text> </maths> </p>
    <p>
      <maths> <formula-text> <i>SD</i>(<b>1</b>)*≦<i>SD</i>(<b>1</b>)<sup>2</sup> <i>+SD</i>(<b>2</b>)<sup>2</sup> <i>, SD</i>(<b>2</b>)*≦<i>SD</i>(<b>1</b>)<sup>2</sup> <i>+SD</i>(<b>4</b>)<sup>2</sup>,  (2)</formula-text> </maths> </p>
    <p>where the star, *, indicates the statistic at the output of each level of XOR error correction while the unstarred values are those at the input of the error correction level, SD(t) is the serial dependence as a function time, SD(<b>1</b>) indicates the first order serial dependence, that is, the serial dependence at the first sample period, SD(<b>2</b>) the second order serial dependence, etc. Equations (1) and (2) are applicable for small B<sub>2 </sub>and SD(t), i.e. B<sub>2</sub>SD(t) &lt;0.01. As both B<sub>2 </sub>and SD(t) near their maxima, more complex equations apply.</p>
    <p>Another point in these design equations is that the square of B<sub>2 </sub>for the original BRS, i.e. B<sub>2</sub> <sup>2</sup>, is a component of SD(t). If SD(t)′ is the serial dependence with B<sub>2</sub>=0, then</p>
    <p>
      <maths> <formula-text> <i>SD</i>(<i>t</i>)=<i>SD</i>(<i>t</i>)′+B<sub>2</sub> <sup>2</sup>.  (4)</formula-text> </maths> </p>
    <p>From the above it is seen that B<sub>2</sub> <sup>2 </sup>must be kept low, or at least less than or equal to SD(t)′.</p>
    <p>Using equations (1) and (2) and measured values of SD(t) for a real system, one may calculate the final output statistics for a two-level XOR defect reducer. For the embodiment of the invention shown in FIG. <b>1</b> and described in connection with FIGS. 2-11, |B<sub>2</sub>|≦0.002 and |SD(t)|≦0.0004 if t≧SP, where SP=one sample period, i.e. 12.5 microseconds for the embodiment described. For this embodiment, B<sub>2 </sub>is suitably small, since |B<sub>2</sub> <sup>2</sup>|≦0.000004, and thus it contributes only about 1% of SD(t). Putting these values into equations (1) and (2), one obtains: At 1st level XOR output <b>711</b> or <b>713</b>: B<sub>2</sub>* ≦0.0004; SD(t≧25 microseconds)*≦3.2×10<sup>−7</sup>. At the second level output <b>715</b>, i |B**|≦3.2×10<sup>−7</sup>, SD(t≧50 microseconds)**≦2.05×10<sup>−13</sup>. At 20,000 bits per second, it would take, on the average, about 50 years for a defect to show up in the 1/0 balance with a 95% confidence level, while a defect in SD(t) could never be detected.</p>
    <p>The above discussion leads to the process for making an RNG shown in FIG. <b>18</b>. In step <b>1806</b> a prototype RNG is designed and built. This prototype need only include the portions of the circuit up to the output which produces the binary pulse, such as up to node <b>176</b> in FIG. 1, though the whole circuit may be built to be sure that any interactions between parts are accounted for. In step <b>1807</b>, B<sub>2 </sub>is measured on the prototype at node <b>176</b> or other output of interest and is easily reduced below 0.005 by trimming. In step <b>1808</b>, SD(t) is then measured at analog to binary output <b>176</b> at several sample rates, as shown in FIG. 14, for example. Then, using the measured values of SD(t) and equations (1) and (2), in step <b>1810</b>, the predicted SD(t) is calculated for one or more levels of defect correction, and preferably also as a function of delay time or sample rate, or at least for several different sample rates. Then, in step <b>1812</b>, the results are analyzed and a sample rate and level of defect correction, or just one of the foregoing in a simplified process, are selected. In step <b>1814</b>, the complete random noise generator is fabricated with the selected sample rate and level of defect correction. Finally, in step <b>1816</b>, the measurements in step <b>1808</b> are repeated to verify the integrity of the process.</p>
    <p>The above process was used to fabricate the RNG system <b>1100</b>. As suggested above, variations of this process are at once evident. Indicators of the amount of defects in a system may be used other than SD(t) and B<sub>2</sub>. As suggested above, statistics may be used to derive such other indicators. Or one of the parameters, such as the sample rate or the level of defect correction, may be fixed at a value that is known to be desirable in the RNG to be fabricated, and the process may then be simplified since not as many parameters need to be measured and calculated.</p>
    <p>A feature of the invention is that it provides a random number generator that produces a random sequence of bits in which the defects in randomness are so small that they cannot be detected with a 95% confidence level over trillions of years of continuous testing, a time period that is longer than the presently believed age of the universe.</p>
    <p>Another feature that permits the low randomness defects is that 8 separate power sources are used, i.e. pins <b>2</b> through <b>9</b> of the parallel port <b>1150</b>, and each power source is separately filtered; for example, the filtering of the power from pin <b>5</b> of connector J<b>2</b> is via resistor <b>220</b> and capacitor <b>210</b> in FIG. 2, while the filtering of the power from pin <b>4</b> of connector J<b>2</b> is via resistor <b>344</b> and capacitor <b>318</b> in FIG. <b>3</b>. This prevents correlations between different parts of the circuit from occurring.</p>
    <p>A further feature of the invention is that it provides a high-quality random number generator that runs on very low power. The circuit <b>100</b> uses voltages of between 2.7 and 5 volts, draws less than a milliamp from each of the eight parallel port <b>1150</b> pins which supply the power, and draws a total power of about 12 mlliwatts. A key factor in this is the use of only 74HC series logic chips, which are high-speed, low-power, CMOS integrated circuits. A related feature is that the power required by RNG circuit <b>100</b> is so low that it can be provided by the data lines <b>2</b>-<b>9</b> of the parallel port <b>1150</b> of a computer <b>1104</b>. A further related feature is that the negative voltage for the low amplitude portion <b>101</b> of the RNG circuit is provided by a charge pump.</p>
    <p>Another feature of the invention is that, even with such low power, the amplifier <b>380</b> according to the invention has low internal noise and a wide band width. One factor that contributes to this is the use of a high-impedance FET input which reduces the chance of randomness-defects-producing interference from external sources. The noise of the amplifier in analog noise generator represents only about 25% of the total amplified noise. The use of either the TL06X series operational amplifiers, where X=0, 1, 2, or 4, the National Semiconductor LF44Y op amps, where Y is 1, 2, or 4, or the Burr-Brown AD548 and AD648 single and dual op amps is an important factor in this feature.</p>
    <p>Another feature of the invention is the high speed at low power of the comparator <b>440</b> in analog to binary converter <b>110</b>. The comparator <b>440</b>, as configured herein, is a high-speed CMOS amplifier that is capable of producing a logic transition in 10 nanoseconds, or only 20 nanoseconds to complete a cycle. This maintains the high band-width necessary to reduce randomness defects. It also is an important contributor to a related feature, i.e. that the RNG produces a sequence of high-quality random bits at high speed.</p>
    <p>A further feature of the invention is that the RNG module <b>1102</b> and the software to operate it are relatively inexpensive. Prior art RNG's of comparable quality are hundreds of times more expensive.</p>
    <p>There has been described a novel random number generator which is inexpensive, is interfaced directly with a personal computer, and which has many other advantages. It is evident that, now that the invention has been fully disclosed, those skilled in the art may now make numerous uses and modifications of the specific embodiment described, without departing from the inventive concepts. For example, now that it is seen that an inexpensive random number generator may be made by judicious selection of electronic components combined with frequency compensation, selection of the optimum sampling frequency, and randomness defect correction, one or more of these factors may be eliminated by increasing the contribution of one of the other factors, such as another level of defect correction, or by willingness to accept somewhat more defectiveness. The invention may be interfaced with any computer, not just a personal computer, and may be interfaced with the computer using a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program or a portion of the operating system, other than the device driver described. Other true random signal sources may be used. Or equivalent components or circuits can be substituted for the various components and circuits described. Additional features may be added. A greater or lesser number of parts may be used. Consequently, the invention is to be construed as embracing each and every novel feature and novel combination of features present in and/or possessed by the random number generator described.</p>
