<heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading> <p num="p-0002">This application claims the benefit of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/134,534 filed May 20, 2005, which issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7,231,744 on Jun. 19, 2007, which claimed the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/586,692 filed Jul. 8, 2004.</p>
  <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">A. Field of the Invention</p>
  <p num="p-0004">The field of the present invention relates generally to wall and roof systems, particularly metal roof installations, that are configured to facilitate air circulation between layers of the wall and/or roof and vent the heated air therefrom. More particularly, this invention relates to such vented roof and wall systems that are configured to reduce the heat transfer into the structure from the roof and wall. Even more particularly, this invention is further configured to provide environmental benefits, such as improved interior air circulation and the production of hot water and electricity.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">B. Background</p>
  <p num="p-0006">Many structures utilize metal roof systems to protect the interior of the structure from exposure to the elements, including sun, rain, snow and the like. Metal roofs are beneficially utilized on metal, brick, wood and various other structures. Generally, the structure is built with interior columns that support a series of rafters or beams attached at the top of the columns. The roof rafters or beams are typically attached in a sloped manner with a ridge at the top or, particularly with commercial buildings, at one end of the structure to provide positive downward drainage. Spanning the rafters or beams are a series of light gauge metal Z-shaped or C-shaped structural members commonly referred to as purlins. The purlins generally run perpendicular to the rafters or beams and are configured to be in a spaced apart relationship to each other provide structural support for the overlying metal roof system.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">One well known and commonly utilized metal roof system for sloped roofs comprises a decking attached to the purlins and a plurality of metal panels attached to the decking with a thermal barrier disposed between the decking and the metal panels. The decking material is attached with screws or bolts directly to the purlins that are attached to the roof rafters or beams. Most often, but not exclusively, the decking consists of a plurality of wooden panels, such as plywood, spaced side-by-side on top of the purlins. In many areas of the United States, the thermal and waterproof barrier is placed over the decking material to resist the flow of water, either from rain or snow, into the structure and to provide some degree of insulating effect for the interior of the structure. One common type of thermal barrier comprises roofing (i.e, felt) paper with a plastic covering over the roofing paper. The uppermost part of the roof, the metal panels, are attached to the decking on top of the thermal barrier. A very common type of metal panel utilized for metal roofs is the corrugated steel sheet having a plurality of spaced apart and parallel, alternating ribs and valleys. One type of such system is referred to as standing seem metal roofing, which utilizes metal roof panels having a standing rib on one side of the roof panel and a hook rib on the opposite side of the panel. The hook rib of one panel is placed over the standing rib of the adjacent panel and a machine is utilized to seam or join together the two adjacent panels by jointly folding over the hook rib and standing rib. Although the rib configuration (i.e., the shape and size) varies considerably among the many manufacturers of corrugated panels, the valleys are generally flat to form a lower plane that is spaced apart from the top of the ribs. Threaded screws are typically used to attach the metal panels to the underlying decking.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">The above-described roofing system is generally sufficient to obtain a relatively strong, lightweight and weather resistant roof to protect the interior and building components of a structure. A common and well known problem with all metal roofs, however, results from the high thermal conductivity of the metal material used for the roofing. During cold weather or when snow is on the roof, the metal roof components will contract. When there is sunshine, even during cold days, the sun will heat up the upper metal panels and the air trapped between the metal panels and the decking. The heretofore standard configuration for metal roofs results in thermal expansion and contraction (i.e., thermal flexing) of the roof in response to temperature changes during the day and through the seasons. In areas of the United States where colder temperatures and/or snow conditions are common in the winter months, the thermal flexing of the roofing material is even more pronounced (particularly on the side of the roof that faces the sun). One well known result of this thermal flexing is that the threaded metal screws will back partially or completely out from the decking to which they were attached. The heating and cooling of the interior of the structure worsens this problem by creating back pressure that helps work the screw out. In addition to the obvious problem of reducing the structural integrity of the roof system, the backing out of the screws creates a conduit for moisture to enter into the space between the metal panels and the decking. Once moisture enters this area, it begins to result in the rotting of the thermal barrier and then the underlying decking, thereby damaging the roof and necessitating expensive repairs and/or retrofitting of the roof. Even without the backing out problem, moisture can build-up in between the metal panels and the decking due to the “sweating” of the metal panels from the temperature fluctuations of the air trapped therein.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">Builders of structures having metal roofs have long known of the benefits of installing a vent along the roof ridge to vent out air from the attic or interior of the structure. Early vents were as simple as an open slot running along the entire length of the ridge. Later vents were developed to allow air to escape but prevent moisture and other elements from entering the interior of the structure. The ridge vents allow air to vent from the structure by convection airflow and by suction from wind blowing across the roof. Air vents added to the eave (or soffit) of the structure improved airflow by providing passive ventilation through the introduction of fresh ambient air into the attic or interior. As stale, hot air is withdrawn from the structure by convection and/or wind suction at the ridge vent, fresh ambient air is drawn into the attic or structure at the eave vent.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">Other inventors have developed a variety of systems for the convection of air from structures having metal roofs. For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 5,765,329 to Huang describes roof venting system for metal roofs using two sets of corrugated metal sheets with spacers between the sheets to vent hot air to the atmosphere through a plurality of apertures in the corrugated sheets for improved heat radiation, heat insulation and the withdrawal of gasses from the interior space of the building. U.S. Pat. No. 5,826,383 to Garrison describes a roof venting system that utilizes ridge venting and eave venting to vent hot air from the interior of the building while preventing water, debris and pests from entering the interior of the building. U.S. Pat. No. 5,561,953 to Rotter describes a roof ridge ventilation system for metal roofs to allow vapors inside the building to vent out through an air permeable, resilient member located at the roof ridge. U.S. Pat. No. 5,367,848 to McConnohie describes a bracket for use to attach a new metal roof over the ribbed panels of an existing corrugated metal roof.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">A metal roof system configured to solve the thermal flexing problems described above is set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 6,401,412 to Cooper (the '412 patent), one of the present inventors. The disclosure of the '412 patent is incorporated herein by this reference. In summary, the roof system described in the '412 patent comprises a lower wooden decking layer, an upper metal panel layer and a spacer disposed between the decking and metal panels. In certain parts of the United States it is advantageous to include a thermal barrier layer between the decking and the spacers to further protect the decking. The decking is generally attached to the roof rafters, or to purlins attached to the roof rafters, with the use of screws and the like, as are suitable for securely fastening the decking to the structure. Typically, the decking is made from a plurality of plywood panels laid side-by-side across the entire roof of the structure. The metal panels can comprise a plurality of corrugated metal sheets joined together side-by-side across the roof (i.e., standing seam roof system) and attached to the spacers on the decking utilizing metal screws or other fastening devices for securely fastening the metal panels to the spacer. The metal panels are joined to the spacers at the flat valleys.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">In the preferred embodiment of the invention described in the '412 patent, the spacer comprises a shaped member, such as a z-shaped purlin, configured to have a generally planar top section to abut the planar surface formed by the flat valleys of the metal panels, a generally flat bottom section to abut the planar surface of the decking and a center section that vertically disposes the top and bottom sections in a spaced apart relationship. The bottom section of the spacer attaches to the decking or the rafters or purlins under the decking using the appropriate wood or metal screws. The metal panels attach to the top section of the spacer at the flat valley portions of the metal panels using metal screws or the like. The center section of the spacer includes one or more openings therein to form an airflow cavity between the decking and the metal panels. In the preferred embodiment, the center section has a plurality of openings sized and configured so as to not substantially reduce the strength and carrying capability of the spacer.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">Although the roof system of the '412 patent works well to increase air flow beneath the metal roof panels and reduce the effect of thermal changes on the roof system, an improved venting system that cooperates with such a roof installation is needed to further facilitate the circulation of air so as to better obtain the benefits therefrom. As well known in the art, many commercial roofs are configured to be generally flat, as opposed to the typical home roof having a centrally disposed ridge, with only a slight degree of incline from the top or high end to the bottom or low end. Most commercial roofs have a parapet wall around the outer edges of the roof that has one or more drainage openings therein on at least the sides and the lower end to drain water off the roof, generally to the ground below. Typically, the metal roof of commercial buildings extends from parapet to parapet.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">As is well known in the building and roofing industries, many modern buildings are constructed with materials and are configured in a manner that is designed to provide environmental benefits for operation and use of the building. In fact, many buildings are evaluated on the environmental friendliness of the completed structure. With regard to roof systems, many building contractors and owners desire to have a “green roof” that, in addition to satisfying the usual structure protection requirements, utilizes improved materials and systems to reduce the cost of using the building (i.e., lower electricity consumption by reducing the requirements to heat and/or cool the building interior), which also benefits the environment through reduced generation of electricity by fossil fuels or other means. Examples of such materials and systems are well known and include the use of metal (i.e., recyclable) roof panels or shingles, solar panels mounted to the roof so as to directly produce electricity, roof mounted solar heated piping systems to produce hot water for pools and hot water supply systems, and roof coverings, coatings or insulation to better insulate the roof and reduce the summer heating or winter cooling effect thereon. Metal roofs also have the advantage of a relatively high strength-to-weight ratio, which reduce the stresses on the other structure components and allows metal roofing to be used to cover old roofing materials, which reduces the need to remove the old materials and dispose of them in landfills and other disposal sites. Piping systems are also known to divert heated water through the floor of the structure so as to reduce the need to heat the structure or cool water through the floor to reduce the need to cool the structure. To assist in characterizing and evaluating the environmental performance of different structures, the United States Green Building Council (the “USGBC”) developed a rating system to compare the environmental, economic, health and productivity performance of a “green building” to a conventional building. With this rating system, known as the Leadership in Energy &amp; Environmental Design or (“LEED”), a building is evaluated with a checklist that allows the building to earn points or credits for meeting specific identified performance criteria and obtain a Leed certification level (i.e., silver, gold or platinum levels). In addition to the use of “green” materials and systems resulting in reduced operating costs for the building, a higher rating level can affect the availability of grants and/or other funding for the building. In general, the use of metal for the roof is known to contribute points toward the certification of a building as “green” under the above-mentioned standards.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">In addition to providing a building that is more economical to operate, building contractors and owners generally desire to provide a structure that is healthy to live or work in. Unfortunately, for many people the interior of their home or office may not be that healthy of an environment due to the circulation of air through the building that carries dust, pollen or other allergens or pollutants. For these people specifically, and others in general, the interior air of the building in which they live or work is known to cause breathing, allergy and other health problems that can substantially reduce the quality and enjoyment of their lives. To address this concern, a number of homes, office buildings and other structures have been built with or modified to incorporate air filtration systems that are configured to remove or at least substantially reduce the dust, allergens, pollutants and other materials in the air being circulated in the building. A variety of different air filtration devices, including filter systems having HEPA or similar filters, are well known for use in cleaning the interior air of a building. Generally, these devices are placed in the stream of air coming into the building to remove the dust, allergens, pollutants or other materials therein so that a substantially clean stream of air can be circulated inside the building.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">One area of the building that has been generally not addressed with regard to improved environmental performance is the exterior wall. Although a variety of exterior wall materials have been developed to provide long life and, to some extent, reduce the heat transfer into the building, wall systems have not changed much over the years. Despite the fact that much of a building's exposure to the elements along the walls of the building, specific systems for reducing the heat transfer into the building through the wall are not generally commercially available.</p>
  <p num="p-0017">What is needed, therefore, is an improved venting system for roof installations, particularly metal roof installations, and for walls that tie into such roof systems, particularly those utilized on commercial buildings and the like. It is particularly desirable to provide a venting system for roofs and walls that is configured to cooperate with an air circulating/venting system, such as that described in the '412 patent or which is otherwise utilized. The preferred venting system should be configured to more beneficially vent the air from between an upper layer of roofing material and the lower layer of roofing materials, such as between metal roof panels and the underlying wood sheathing, and from between an outer wall layer and an inner wall layer. The system should be relatively simple to install and not add substantially to the cost of the typical roof and wall systems. In an even more preferred system, a vented roof and wall system is desired that utilizes the vented air for purposes of improving the air circulated to the interior of the building, providing hot water for use in or around the building and to provide a source of electricity for the building.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0018">The improved vented wall and roof system of the present invention provides the benefits and solves the problems identified above. That is to say, the present invention discloses a wall and roof venting system for metal and other types of roof installations, that can be utilized with roofs having an air circulation system incorporated therein, such as that described in the '412 patent, and which is effective at venting air from the roof system. The venting system of the present invention is adaptable to new wall and roof installations and is both relatively simple and economical to install. In one configuration, the wall and roof venting system better vents the heated air from between the outer and inner wall layers and from between the upper and lower roof layers to reduce the problems that are known to be associated with thermal flexing. In the preferred embodiment, the wall and roof system is configured to utilize the vented air for purposes of supplying a better quality (i.e., cleaner/filtered) air to the interior of the building, providing heated air that assists in warming water passing through a roof piping system, which is preferably configured to also be heated by the sun, to supply hot water for use in or near the building, and generating electricity for use in or near the building. In a preferred configuration, due to the known air circulation that results, the upper roof layer is a metal panel or shingle system and the lower layer is a wood sheathing, such as plywood or the like, that is separated by a plurality of generally Z-shaped spacers. Alternatively, various other materials can be utilized for the upper and/or lower roof layers. In a preferred configuration of the wall system, the outer siding layer is separated from the sheathing by a plurality of generally Z-shaped spacers. In the preferred configurations for both the wall and roof systems, a radiant barrier is disposed between the upper/outer and lower/inner layers.</p>
  <p num="p-0019">In one general aspect of the present invention, the roof venting system is configured for a roof having a top end, a lower end, a first side and a second side with a lower roof layer, an upper roof layer and one or more spacers, such as the Z-shaped members disclosed in the '412 patent, disposed between and interconnecting the lower roof layer and the upper roof layer. The spacers configured to maintain the upper roof layer in spaced apart relation to the lower roof layer and provide an air flow channel therebetween. A gap is provided in the upper roof layer generally at or near the top end of the roof for placement of a roof vent component. As set forth below, the roof vent component is generally configured to beneficially disperse and/or utilize the vented air that flows upward from the bottom end of the roof toward the top end of the roof through the air flow channel. In one configuration, the roof vent component comprises a vent support member enclosing the gap and one or more vents attached to the vent support member for venting the vented air to the environment from the air flow channel. One or more fans can be installed on the upper roof layer, generally near the bottom end of the roof and in fluid flow communication with the air flow channel, to discharge outside air into the air flow channel. In the preferred embodiment, the roof vent component comprises a roof piping system having one or more pipes that configured to receive water from a source of water, such as a municipal water supply or a well. The roof piping system is placed in fluid communication with the air flow channel so that the vented air will pass across the pipes. Preferably, the roof piping system is particularly configured to facilitate the transfer heat from the vented air to the water in the pipes to produce hot water for use in the structure or elsewhere. The roof piping system can discharge the hot water to one or more storage tanks and/or to a floor piping system to heat the floor and, therefore, the interior of the structure. Also in the preferred embodiment, the roof has a translucent section configured to allow heat from the sun to heat the pipes of the piping system and the water carried thereby. A water filtration apparatus is hydraulically interconnected with the piping system to filter and/or treat the water before and/or after it is heated in the piping system. In one embodiment, the vented air is vented out vents after heating the pipes in the piping system. In the preferred embodiment, a vent collector at the top end of the roof is configured to direct the vented air into a duct system for distribution as interior air. Preferably, the vented air is filtered by an air filter apparatus prior to distribution as interior air. For use in the winter, the heated air is directed into the structure's interior to heat the interior. In the summer or warmer months, the vented air is cooled by an air cooling apparatus prior to distribution as interior air. In another embodiment, the roof vent system includes an electrical generating apparatus in fluid flow communication with the vented air.</p>
  <p num="p-0020">In another general aspect of the present invention, a wall venting system is provided that, preferably, discharges vented air flowing therethrough into the roof venting system for discharge or use thereby. In one embodiment, the wall venting system comprises an inner wall layer and an outer wall layer that are maintained in spaced apart relation by a plurality of wall spacers disposed therebetween to define a wall air flow channel. In the preferred embodiment, the wall spacers are generally Z-shaped members that have holes therein to allow the vented air to flow from the bottom of the wall to the top of the wall. The exterior air enters the wall air flow channel at or near the bottom of the wall through a wall intake vent. The vented air flowing through the wall air flow channel can be discharged out the top of the wall or directed into the roof air flow channel to be beneficially dispersed or utilized by the roof vent component.</p>
  <p num="p-0021">In yet another general aspect of the present invention, either or both the roof and wall air flow channels are provided with a rigid member that defines an inner air flow channel and an outer flow channel. Air convection through both of the inner and outer air flow channels further reduces the amount of heat transfer from the exterior of the roof or wall to the interior of the building. The dual air flow channels can be provided by utilizing a single roof or wall spacer with the rigid member being disposed between pairs of adjacent spacers or they can be provided by utilizing a first spacer between the rigid member and the inner layer and a second spacer between the rigid member and the outer layer of the roof or wall. If desired, a vane apparatus can be utilized to generate electricity in response to the flow of air through one or more channels. Alternatively, flowing water from a source of water can be utilized to rotate the vane apparatus and generate electricity.</p>
  <p num="p-0022">Accordingly, the primary objective of the present invention is to provide a wall and roof venting system that provides the advantages discussed above and overcomes the disadvantages and limitations associated with presently available wall and roof venting systems.</p>
  <p num="p-0023">It is also an important objective of the present invention to provide an effective and economical wall and roof venting system for use with metal and other roof installations that is adaptable to those installations which are utilizing a roof air circulation system, such as that described in the '412 patent.</p>
  <p num="p-0024">It is also an important objective of the present invention to provide a wall and roof venting system that improves the environmental, economic, health and productivity performance of the building as a whole so as to provide a more “green” building than is obtainable with conventional wall and roof systems.</p>
  <p num="p-0025">It is also an important objective of the present invention to provide a wall and roof venting system for metal and other roofs that is reasonably straightforward and economical to install.</p>
  <p num="p-0026">It is also an important objective of the present invention to provide a wall and roof venting system that is configured to direct the vented air for use with systems that provide clean and/or cool air to the interior of the building, hot water for use in the building and/or electricity for use in the building.</p>
  <p num="p-0027">It is also an important objective of the present invention to provide a roof venting system that comprises an air flow channel disposed between an upper roof layer and a lower roof layer with a fluid piping system disposed in the air flow channel and configured such that the vent air heats the fluid in the pipes, a thermally translucent section in the upper roof layer disposed generally above the fluid piping system to heat the fluid in the piping system, an air filtration system to filter the vented air before discharging the air into the interior of the building, a cooling system to cool the air prior to discharge into the building and/or an electrical production mechanism to utilize the thermal properties of the vented air to produce electricity.</p>
  <p num="p-0028">It is also an important objective of the present invention to provide a wall and roof venting system that comprises an air flow channel disposed between an inner and outer wall layer, separated by a plurality of spacer members, that connects to an air flow channel disposed between an upper roof layer and a lower roof layer, also separated by a plurality of spacer members, so as to receive air into the wall system and vent heated air out of the roof system so as to reduce heat transfer into the building, thereby providing a generally more environmentally friendly or “green” building.</p>
  <p num="p-0029">The above and other objectives of the present invention will be explained in greater detail by reference to the attached figures and the description of the preferred embodiment which follows.

In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>, venting system <b>10</b> is configured for metal roof <b>12</b> and is shown in use on a commercial building having high or top end <b>14</b>, an opposite low or bottom end <b>16</b> and opposing first side <b>18</b> and second side <b>20</b>. A portion of the building's wall, referred to as the parapet <b>22</b>, is disposed around the outer periphery of the building and extends above the roof. Upper roof layer <b>24</b>, which in the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref> is comprised of a series of adjacent metal roof panels having a plurality of ribs <b>26</b> and valleys <b>28</b> between the ribs <b>26</b>, is disposed in spaced apart relation above lower roof layer <b>30</b>, which in the configuration shown is comprised of a plurality of plywood wood sheathing members. As well known by those skilled in the art, lower roof layer <b>30</b> is fixedly attached to the roof supporting structure, such as rafters or purlins attached to rafters (not shown). To obtain the most benefits from the present invention, venting system <b>10</b> is generally disposed at or near top end <b>14</b> of roof <b>12</b>. As described in the '412 patent, a plurality of roof spacers <b>32</b>, such as z-shaped members having holes <b>34</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) in the vertical portion thereof, are disposed between and generally interconnect lower roof layer <b>30</b> and upper roof layer <b>24</b> to maintain the two layers in a spaced apart relation and to provide an air flow channel <b>36</b> therebetween which allows air to flow upward (i.e., generally from bottom end <b>16</b> to top end <b>14</b>) between the lower <b>30</b> and upper <b>24</b> roof layers. In prior art roof installations, the metal panels or other members of upper roof layer <b>24</b> extend all the way to parapet <b>22</b> at top end <b>14</b> of the building. In the present invention, upper roof layer <b>24</b> does not extend the entirely to parapet <b>22</b>, thereby providing a gap <b>38</b> between upper roof layer <b>24</b> and parapet <b>22</b> at top end <b>14</b>. As shown in the figures and described in detail below, a roof vent component is generally disposed in gap <b>38</b> and configured to beneficially handle (i.e., vent) or utilize the vented air in air flow channel <b>36</b> to provide the improved roof venting system <b>10</b> of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0044">As best shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in one configuration of venting system <b>10</b> the roof vent component comprises a vent support member <b>40</b> positioned in gap <b>38</b> between the end of upper roof layer <b>24</b> and the parapet <b>22</b> at top end <b>14</b>. In a preferred embodiment, vent support member <b>40</b> is an elongated section of sheet metal that extends along the entire length (i.e., generally from first side <b>18</b> to second side <b>20</b>) of top end <b>14</b> of roof <b>12</b> and which comprises an overlap section <b>42</b>, a first upstanding section <b>44</b>, a center section <b>46</b> and a second upstanding section <b>48</b>. In the preferred embodiment overlap section <b>42</b> is generally planar, however other non-planar configurations can also be utilized, and configured to extend over the end of upper roof layer <b>24</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a sufficient distance to provide support therefor and reduce the likelihood of water intrusion underneath. First upstanding section <b>44</b> is a short generally vertical section that interconnects overlap section <b>42</b> with center section <b>46</b>. Center section <b>46</b> interconnects first upstanding section <b>44</b> and second upstanding section <b>48</b> and is configured to support vent pipe <b>50</b>. Second upstanding section <b>48</b> is disposed in a generally vertical configuration or perpendicular to center section <b>46</b> and disposed in a generally abutting relationship with parapet <b>22</b>. Although a preferred embodiment of vent support member <b>40</b> is configured as described above, those skilled in the art will recognize that numerous other configurations for vent support member <b>40</b> are also possible. In one configuration, overlap section <b>42</b> is of sufficient length to provide a twelve inch overlap, center section <b>46</b> is four inches long and second upstanding section <b>48</b> is six inches high. In a preferred embodiment of venting system <b>10</b> of the present invention, a connecting member <b>52</b>, such as a nail or screw, is used to secure second upstanding section <b>48</b> to parapet <b>22</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0045">To prevent water or debris from getting between second upstanding section <b>48</b> and parapet <b>22</b>, the preferred embodiment of the present invention also utilizes a flashing member <b>54</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, that is attached to parapet <b>22</b> and extends over the top of second upstanding member <b>48</b>. Various glues or other adhesives can be utilized to attach the upper end of flashing member <b>54</b> to the parapet <b>22</b>. Preferably, flashing member <b>52</b> is configured to extend generally downward so as to prevent water or debris from getting between second upstanding section <b>48</b> and parapet <b>22</b>. Flashing member <b>54</b> can be configured with one or more angles, as shown, to provide the desired coverage. In one embodiment, the upper end of flashing member <b>54</b> extends partially into parapet <b>22</b> to provide a more secure attachment to parapet <b>22</b>. To prevent water or debris from entering into roof installation <b>12</b> beneath overlap section <b>42</b>, a waterproof barrier or other device can be utilized at the end of overlap section <b>42</b>. In addition, it may be preferable to utilize one or more securing mechanisms, such as screws, rivets or other connectors, to secure overlap section <b>42</b> to upper roof layer <b>24</b> at or near the end at top end <b>14</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0046">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, because the ribs <b>26</b> of the roof panels that make up upper roof layer <b>24</b> run generally perpendicular to overlap section <b>42</b> and are displace approximately two inches above the valley <b>28</b> of the metal panel, a plurality of small openings <b>56</b> will result. Each opening <b>56</b> will be framed by overlap section <b>42</b> on the top, a pair of generally parallel ribs <b>26</b> on the sides and the valley <b>28</b> between the pair of ribs <b>26</b> on the bottom. To prevent water or debris from getting into the roof installation <b>12</b>, it will generally be necessary to block of each of openings <b>56</b> with a small section of sheet metal or other material (not shown).</p>
  <p num="p-0047">Positioned on center section <b>46</b> at various intervals along the length of vent support member <b>40</b> between first side <b>18</b> and second side <b>20</b> are a plurality of vents <b>50</b> to vent air away from inside roof installation <b>12</b> (i.e., that air which flows in air flow channel <b>36</b> between lower roof layer <b>30</b> and upper roof layer <b>24</b> through the openings <b>14</b> in spacers <b>32</b>) in the embodiment of the air circulation system described in the '412 patent. Generally, vents <b>50</b> will be disposed above gap <b>38</b> to vent air therefrom. In one configuration, vents <b>50</b> comprise a small section of cylindrical tubular pipe approximately 6 inches high and approximately 2½ inches in diameter. As those skilled in the art will readily know, other configurations for vents <b>50</b> are also possible. As also known to those skilled in the art, it is generally best for vent <b>50</b> to be at least minimally angled at the point where vent <b>50</b> attaches to center section <b>46</b> of vent support member <b>40</b>. To prevent water, debris or pests from entering roof installation <b>12</b>, vent <b>50</b> can be provided with a screen cover <b>58</b> and a flapper-type of mechanism <b>60</b> that maintains the vent in a closed condition unless air is being discharged from venting system <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0048">To facilitate the flow of vent air in air flow channel <b>36</b> in roof installation <b>12</b> and the discharge of the vented air to the roof vent component (i.e., vent support <b>40</b> and vents <b>50</b>) of venting system <b>10</b>, the preferred embodiment of venting system <b>10</b> includes at least one fan or other air blowing mechanism <b>62</b> located on upper roof layer <b>24</b> near bottom end <b>16</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A hole (not shown) can be cut into the valley <b>28</b> of the one or more roof panels that make up upper roof layer <b>24</b> to allow the fans to be in fluid-flow communication with air flow channel <b>36</b> between the wood sheathing of lower roof layer <b>30</b> and the metal panels of upper layer <b>24</b>. Fan <b>62</b> is configured to pull air into the roof installation <b>12</b> from the atmosphere and discharge air into air flow channel <b>36</b> so as to cause air to flow out vents <b>50</b> located near top end <b>14</b>. An example fan <b>62</b> is a 800 cfm solar powered air pulling fan that has a motor disposed inside a fan housing positioned on upper roof layer <b>24</b> which is connected to a source of electrical power, such as one or more solar panels or the building electrical system. Preferably, fan <b>62</b> includes a light sensitive switch that is configured to activate fan <b>62</b> in the sunlight and deactivate it at night (to prevent moist night air from being pulled into roof installation <b>12</b>). Alternatively, fan <b>62</b> can include other timing mechanisms. As stated above, depending on the size of the building and the need to vent air from roof installation <b>12</b>, venting system <b>10</b> can comprise a plurality of such fans <b>62</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0049">The preferred embodiment of the roof system <b>10</b> of the present invention is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 6</figref>. As set forth in more detail below, in this embodiment, roof <b>12</b> is particularly configured for improved environmental, health and economic purposes by including systems to generate hot water, cleaner interior air, cool interior air and/or electricity. Roof <b>12</b> includes a facia member <b>66</b> at the bottom end thereof that includes an intake vent <b>68</b> in the eave for air flow into air flow channel <b>36</b>. In a first configuration of this embodiment, the roof vent component comprises a liquid flow piping system <b>70</b> having an inlet <b>72</b> connected to a supply of water, shown schematically as <b>74</b> and can comprise a municipal water system or a well, and an outlet <b>76</b> that is connected to a hot water distribution system in the structure or a liquid storage unit <b>77</b>, such as a hot water heater tank located in the structure (as shown) or a tank or other storage unit outside the structure. Piping system <b>70</b> is disposed in air flow channel <b>36</b>, preferably in gap <b>38</b> at or near top end <b>14</b> of roof <b>12</b>, such that the vented air, shown as <b>78</b>, will flow over and across piping system <b>70</b>. The water flowing in piping system <b>70</b>, shown as <b>80</b>, will typically be ambient or cold water. As described above and in the '412 patent, the vented air <b>78</b> will be substantially warm or hot and conductively transfer some of its heat to the water <b>80</b> flowing in piping system <b>70</b>. To assist in this transfer, it is preferred that the pipes <b>82</b> that make up piping system <b>70</b> be manufactured out of materials that are somewhat conducive to the heat transfer between the vented air <b>78</b> and water <b>80</b>. As well known in the art, certain metals, such as copper and aluminum, certain thermoplastics, glass and other materials are well suited to the efficient transfer of heat from vented air <b>78</b> to water <b>80</b>. Various configurations for pipes <b>82</b> in piping system <b>70</b> can be utilized to accomplish the desired results of the present invention. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, piping system <b>70</b> can comprise a first curvilinear section <b>84</b> and a second straight section <b>86</b> to provide additional flow path for water <b>80</b> to pass through to obtain the desired warming. Alternatively, piping system <b>70</b> can comprise either curvilinear section <b>84</b> or straight section <b>86</b> or one or more of each. Piping system <b>70</b> can also be configured in separate, interconnected segments for ease of and/or reduced cost of installation. In one configuration, pipe <b>82</b> used for curvilinear section <b>84</b> can have a diameter of two to four inches and pipe <b>82</b> used for straight section <b>86</b> can have a diameter of three to four inches. Numerous other configurations for piping system <b>70</b> are suitable for use with the venting system <b>10</b> of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0050">In use with the venting configuration shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>, the hot vented air <b>78</b> will flow through air flow channel <b>36</b> from bottom end <b>16</b> to top end <b>14</b>, assisted by fans <b>62</b> if desired, and pass across pipes <b>82</b> of piping system <b>70</b> to heat the water <b>80</b> passing through pipes <b>82</b>, which will be discharged through outlet <b>76</b> for use in the structure (if desired), and then be vented to the environment through vents <b>50</b> on vent support member <b>40</b>. As set forth in more detail below, water <b>80</b> discharged through outlet <b>76</b> may be too hot for regular home hot water uses, such as washing, showering and the like. If so, the water <b>80</b> discharged from piping system <b>70</b> should either be allowed to sit in a tank, such as tank <b>77</b>, or be mixed with cold or cool water until cooled sufficiently for the typical home uses. For commercial buildings, including multiple unit dwellings and manufacturing plants, the heated water <b>80</b> from piping system <b>70</b> may be able to be utilized without such storage or mixing. As an example, laundries, restaurants and other facilities that utilize significant amounts of hot water may be able to benefit greatly from this supply of hot water <b>80</b>. As will be recognized by those skilled in the art, the venting system <b>10</b> described above and hereinafter will be able to substantially reduce the costs associated with providing heated water for the building owner or operator of the facilities used therein.</p>
  <p num="p-0051">For improved hot water production, the roof vent component of the roof venting system <b>10</b> of the present invention further comprises a thermally translucent section, shown as <b>88</b>, disposed generally above piping system <b>70</b> so as to allow sunlight to contact pipes <b>82</b> of piping system <b>70</b>. In a preferred embodiment, upper roof layer <b>24</b> ends before top end <b>14</b> and translucent section <b>88</b> covers gap <b>38</b> in which piping system <b>70</b> is positioned. Translucent section <b>88</b> can be made out of a variety of materials, such as glass, tempered glass and plexiglass, that allow a substantial amount of the sun's solar heating therethrough so as to provide additional heat, in addition to that from vented air <b>78</b>, to warm the water <b>80</b> flowing through piping system <b>70</b>. To facilitate this heating, it is preferred that pipes <b>70</b> be made out of materials that best transfer heat or be coated with material to facilitate such heat transfer. As an example, black PVC pipe or copper pipe painted black can be utilized for pipes <b>82</b>. As another example, piping system <b>70</b> can comprise various new composite or other materials, such as the crossed-linked polyethylene material Aquapex® from Uponor Wirsbo. As will be recognized by those skilled in the art, care must be taken to select materials for piping system <b>70</b> and translucent section <b>88</b> that will provide long life, generally resistant to weather and sunlight, are suitable for use above the house and will not easily break or shatter upon contact (i.e., a baseball against translucent section <b>88</b>). In a preferred embodiment of this configuration, translucent section <b>88</b> extends from first side <b>18</b> to second side <b>20</b> of the roof <b>12</b> and is sufficiently wide to substantially expose all of gap <b>38</b> and/or piping system <b>70</b> therein to sunlight. In one configuration of the present invention, a residential home would have a width of two feet and a commercial installation would have a width of four feet. The material utilized for translucent section <b>88</b> can be approximately ¼″ to ⅜″ thick. As is understood by those skilled in the art, the dimensions of translucent section <b>88</b> can be substantially varied and still accomplish the objectives of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">To improve the operating life of piping system <b>88</b> and the quality of water provided to the homeowner, manufacturer or other owner/operator of the structure on which venting system <b>10</b> of the present invention is utilized, a water filtration apparatus <b>90</b> is included therewith. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, water filtration apparatus <b>90</b> can be disposed between the source of water <b>74</b> and inlet <b>72</b> so as to provide suitably pure water for the water <b>80</b> in piping system <b>70</b> to reduce the likelihood or prevent corrosion of pipes <b>82</b>. As known to those skilled in the art, however, it is generally not necessary or even desirable to utilize perfectly pure water, which under certain circumstances can actually increase the rate of corrosion of pipes <b>82</b>. In an alternative configuration, water filtration apparatus <b>90</b> is located after outlet <b>76</b> to filter the water exiting piping system <b>70</b> before it is used in the structure or stored in tank <b>77</b>. Various types of filtration apparatuses are suitable for water filtration apparatus <b>90</b> of the present invention, including reverse osmosis, ultra violet light, chemical and other filtering systems. In addition, water filtration apparatus <b>90</b> can comprise or include a water softener mechanism that reduces corrosion and the likelihood of calcium buildup in piping system <b>70</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0053">As discussed above, water <b>80</b> from outlet <b>76</b> can be utilized for the typical home hot water uses, such as showering, baths, cleaning and the like, or utilized for various commercial purposes, including laundry facilities, dish washing, equipment cleaning, processing and the like. A known use for water <b>80</b> from venting system <b>10</b> is to pass the water through a floor piping system <b>92</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As known in the art, floor piping system <b>92</b> comprises a plurality of floor pipes <b>94</b>, such as the crossed-linked polyethylene material described above, embedded in the floor <b>96</b> of the structure. Hot water passing through the pipes <b>94</b> heat the floor and radiates up through the floor, warming the interior of the structure. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, floor piping system <b>92</b> can be divided into one or more sections to allow the user to control the heating of the floor in various rooms or sections of the structure and to avoid excessive heat loss from having to travel the entire length of pipes <b>94</b>. Floor piping system <b>92</b> can be connected to a environmental control system to facilitate this control. Typical floor heating systems use hot water from the hot water heater or other conventional hot water supply systems. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, floor piping system <b>92</b> receives hot water <b>80</b> from piping system <b>70</b>, thereby substantially reducing the cost of producing the water necessary to effectively heat floor <b>96</b> and the interior of the structure. As such, the venting system <b>10</b> of the present invention will provide an additional environmental benefit of lowering the usage of natural gas, electricity or other fuel source for heating the water for floor piping system <b>92</b>. An additional benefit, achievable with floor heating systems in general is that they reduce the amount of dirt, dust, allergens or other materials in the interior air of the building by reducing or even eliminating the need for hot blowing air to heat the structure. In the warmer, summer months the floor piping system <b>92</b> can be used to pass cool water through floor <b>96</b> to assist in cooling the interior of the structure.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">If a conventional heating system is utilized (i.e., no floor heating system or in addition thereto), then venting system <b>10</b> of the present invention can be utilized to provide the heated air for heating the interior of the structure. In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the roof vent component of venting system <b>10</b> is a vent collector <b>98</b>, which can be configured as or incorporated in the “Boston Ridge” arrangement shown, at the top end <b>14</b> of roof <b>12</b> that is configured to receive vented air <b>78</b> from air flow channel <b>36</b> after it passes around piping system <b>70</b> in gap <b>38</b> and warms the pipes <b>82</b> therein (for use as described above). In this configuration, the vent support member <b>40</b> and vents <b>50</b> described above are not utilized to vent vented air <b>78</b> from air flow channel <b>36</b>. Instead, vent collector <b>98</b> distributes vented air <b>78</b> to a duct system <b>100</b> in the structure so that it may distribute interior air <b>102</b> inside the structure and warm the interior thereof. Use of venting system <b>10</b> in this manner will substantially reduce the cost and environmental impact of having to heat air for circulation inside the structure by reducing or eliminating the need to utilize a separate space heating system. If no cooling system, as explained below, is utilized with venting system <b>10</b>, then it is preferred that vent collector <b>98</b> include valve <b>104</b>, such as a thermostatically controlled flapper valve having a fan (i.e., 45 cfm fan), to allow vented air <b>78</b> to be vented outside of the structure when the vented air <b>78</b> is not desired or needed for heating the interior of the structure, such as during the summer months. In an alternative embodiment, not shown, vent system <b>10</b> includes both the vent support member <b>40</b> and vents <b>50</b> configuration described above and vent collector <b>98</b> and a control system to allow the owner/occupier of the structure to choose between venting vented air <b>78</b> out vents <b>50</b> or use vented air <b>78</b> for heating the interior of the structure. In another alternative embodiment, also not shown, venting system <b>10</b> utilizes the heated air supply system described above without the hot water configuration (i.e., piping system <b>70</b>). As will be recognized by those skilled in the art, a “greener” roof system and a more environmentally friendly overall structure can be obtained by utilizing both the heated air and hot water configurations of venting system <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0055">To improve the quality of interior air <b>102</b> going inside the structure, the preferred embodiment of venting system <b>10</b> of the present invention includes an air filter apparatus <b>106</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>. In the configuration shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, air filter apparatus <b>106</b> is disposed in duct system <b>100</b> after vented air <b>78</b> is discharged from vent collector <b>98</b>. As known to those skilled in the art, air filter apparatus <b>106</b> can be located elsewhere in venting system <b>10</b>. For instance, air filter apparatus <b>106</b> can be located in vent collector <b>98</b>, gap <b>38</b> or (as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) in air flow channel <b>36</b> to filter vented air as it moves through venting system <b>10</b>. Various types of devices are suitable for air filter apparatus <b>106</b>, including dry air filters such as HEPA filtration and micron filter devices, and various liquid filtration devices. In addition, air filter apparatus <b>36</b> can include an ultraviolet light system, such as those well known in the art, to remove bacteria from vented air <b>78</b> before it is discharged as interior air <b>102</b>. Preferably, air filter apparatus <b>106</b> is located and configured so the owner, user or occupant of the structure can replace any replaceable components thereof without any undue difficulty. With air filter apparatus <b>106</b> in place, the warm interior air <b>102</b> being vented into the structure through duct system <b>100</b> will be somewhat to substantially better than most present systems for providing warm air to the interior of a structure. Because of venting system <b>10</b>, this warm, healthier interior air <b>102</b> can be provided with substantially less cost and use of fuel and other environmental resources than present systems.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">For use during the warmer summer months, venting system <b>10</b> can comprise an air cooling apparatus <b>108</b> disposed between vent collector <b>98</b> and the interior of the structure to convert the hot, dry vented air <b>78</b> into a cool interior air <b>102</b>. Numerous air cooling devices are suitable for use for air cooling apparatus <b>108</b>. Conventional coolant-type air cooling apparatuses <b>108</b> can be utilized for venting system <b>10</b>. Alternatively, cooling apparatus <b>108</b> can comprise various concepts from the recently developed magnetic refrigerator technology that utilize a variety of alloys, such as a gadolinium-germanium-silicon alloy with a small amount of iron supplement added, to cool vented air <b>78</b> prior to entering the interior of the building. Various other types of air cooling systems can be utilized for air cooling apparatus <b>108</b>. One type of cooling device that works particularly well with venting system <b>10</b> of the present invention is an evaporative air type of cooling system which passes the air to be cooled through wetted filters, thereby cooling the air. The typical roof type of evaporative air cooling system utilizes a square or rectangular shaped housing having four wettable pads on the sides thereof, a water distribution mechanism to spray or drip water onto the pads and a fan to draw outside air into the housing through the pads. As the air passes through the pads it is cooled by contact with the water in the pads. In the present invention, the air to be cooled is the vented air <b>78</b>. Air cooling apparatus can comprise one or more pads that are connected to a source of water to wet the pads and cool vented air <b>78</b> as it passes therethrough before being discharged from duct system <b>100</b> as interior air <b>102</b>. As is well known, the evaporative air type of air cooling apparatus <b>108</b> is most efficient when hot, dry air is passed through the wetted pads. In fact, this type of system is known not to work too well when the air to be cooled is humid. In the present invention, the vented air <b>78</b> passing through air flow channel <b>36</b> will be generally hot and dry, making it very suitable for use with an evaporative air cooling configuration as air cooling apparatus <b>108</b>. The moisture formed because of the heat/cool of the day/night will be taken out from under upper roof layer <b>24</b>, particularly when upper roof layer <b>24</b> is made from metal panels or shingles. As a result, roof venting system <b>10</b> will be in effect funneling hot, dry air to the evaporative cooling unit for cooling prior to entering the structure as interior air <b>102</b>. The thermostatically controlled valve <b>104</b> facilitates the evacuation of the moisture laden air during the morning hours as the vented air <b>78</b> in air flow channel <b>36</b> begins to heat up. In a preferred embodiment, a solar powered fan is utilized with air cooling apparatus <b>108</b> to drive the vented air <b>78</b> through the pads or other cooling members of air cooling apparatus <b>108</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0057">In another embodiment of the present invention, venting system <b>10</b> also comprises a electrical generating apparatus <b>110</b> that is configured to utilize the hot, dry vented air <b>78</b> to generate electricity therefrom. Electrical generating apparatus <b>110</b> can comprise a thermoacoustic engine to convert the heat from vented air <b>78</b> into acoustic power for a heat-driven electrical generator. The use of resonant macrosonic synthesis or RMS technology to convert harmonic sound waves into energy for operation of compressors, pumps, refrigeration, comfort air conditioning and as a natural gas converter for processing natural fuels into electrical power is still in its infancy stages. Likewise with the use of traveling-wave thermoacoustic heat engines. However, a number of such devices and uses for such devices have been developed by the Los Alamos National Laboratory and others. As this technology further develops, it may be able to be efficiently incorporated into the venting system of the present invention so as to improve the “green” quality thereof. To facilitate such use, the air can be further heated by an additional heating apparatus (not shown), such as a laser equipped space heater or like device that, preferably, uses a low amount of energy itself.</p>
  <p num="p-0058">In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, roof venting system <b>10</b> comprises the use of roof vent components piping system <b>70</b>, translucent section <b>88</b>, water filtration apparatus <b>90</b>, floor piping system <b>92</b>, vent collector <b>98</b>, air filter apparatus <b>106</b> and air cooling apparatus <b>108</b>. Although various specific examples of these components are described above, those skilled in the art will readily recognize that equivalent function configurations or devices can be readily substituted into venting system <b>10</b> to obtain the benefits thereof. Venting system <b>10</b> of the present invention can be incorporated into the construction of a new structure or it can be retrofitted onto an existing structure (i.e., when it is necessary to repair or replace the structure's roof). Depending on the structure and the energy and hot water usage of the owner or occupant thereof, it may be economically beneficial to replace an existing roof, even if the existing roof is not in need of replacement. If retrofitting or placement of venting system <b>10</b> on the structure's roof is not able to be done, then the benefits of the venting system <b>10</b> of the present invention can be obtained by placing a secondary structure off from the main structure and incorporating the features of the present invention on the secondary structure. The basic configuration of the venting system <b>10</b> on the secondary structure would be the same as that described above, except that the hot water, warm air or cool air is transferred to the primary structure where it is used therein or thereby. In a preferred embodiment of this configuration, storage tank <b>77</b> could be larger (i.e., a 500 gallon tank) and placed at least partially in the ground where it will be insulated against temperature loss. In addition, if desired, an on-demand hot water heater can be included as a back-up to the system described above.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">In use, the embodiment of roof venting system <b>10</b> described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 6</figref> provides an improved environmental, economic and health system for owners and occupiers of a structure. Air flows under the eave at bottom end <b>16</b> of roof <b>12</b> and through the intake vent <b>68</b> into air flow channel <b>36</b> disposed between lower roof layer <b>30</b> and upper roof layer <b>24</b>. The vented air <b>78</b> will flow up towards top end <b>14</b> and pass across piping system <b>70</b>, heating the water <b>80</b> flowing in pipes <b>82</b> thereof. Sunlight through translucent section <b>88</b> will further heat the water <b>80</b> flowing in piping system <b>70</b>. Preferably, the water is filtered through water filtration apparatus <b>90</b> to remove impurities which can harm piping system <b>70</b> and/or to provide relatively pure water for use in the structure (i.e., showering, etc.). The heated water <b>80</b> can be used for a variety of household and commercial purposes, including washing, cleaning and the like. In the preferred embodiment, vented air <b>78</b> will then flow into vent collector <b>98</b> and be directed towards duct system <b>100</b>. Air filter apparatus <b>106</b> will filter the air prior to being discharged through duct system as interior air <b>102</b>, thereby improving the quality of air inside the structure. The interior air <b>102</b> can be heated air to warm the interior of the structure or venting system <b>10</b> can include an air cooling apparatus <b>108</b> to cool interior air <b>102</b> and, therefore, the interior of the structure. The air cooling apparatus <b>106</b> can include a solar powered fan to drive vented air <b>78</b> therethrough to the cool interior air <b>102</b>. If desired, one or more storage tanks <b>77</b> can be utilized to store hot water until it is needed in the structure. To improve the ability of the tank <b>77</b> to maintain the temperature of the water, it can be partially or completely buried in the ground or otherwise insulated. If desired, the structure can include a floor piping system <b>92</b> that receives hot water <b>80</b> from venting system <b>10</b> so as to heat the interior space of the structure. During warm summer months, floor piping system <b>92</b> can receive cool or cold water to help in cooling the interior of the structure.</p>
  <p num="p-0060">An alternative configuration for a vented wall and roof system is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 through 11</figref>. In these figures, the benefits of the providing an air flow channel <b>36</b> for the roof of a building are also applied to the building's exterior walls. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the vented wall and roof system, collectively identified as <b>120</b>, comprises lower roof layer <b>30</b>, upper roof layer <b>24</b> and a plurality of roof spacers <b>32</b> disposed therebetween to define air flow channel <b>36</b> through which vented air <b>78</b> flows to vented ridge <b>98</b> where the air is vented to the atmosphere and/or utilized as described above. In one embodiment, lower roof layer <b>30</b> is wooden and comprises an OSB (oriented strand board) sheathing or plywood material. In a preferred configuration, due to the heat convection properties, upper roof layer <b>24</b> comprises a plurality of metal roof sheets (i.e., standing seam) or like material. Alternatively, various other materials, including non-metal materials such as composition and like materials, can be utilized for upper roof layer <b>24</b>. In one preferred configuration, spacers <b>32</b> comprises a metal, generally Z-shaped component having a plurality of holes <b>34</b>, such as one and one-half inch diameter holes three inches on-center, disposed therein to allow vented air <b>78</b> to flow through air channel <b>36</b>. As set forth above, various other shapes and materials can be utilized for spacers <b>32</b> and different configurations and spacing for holes <b>34</b>. In this embodiment, the roof also includes a radiant barrier <b>122</b> disposed between the spacer <b>32</b> and the lower roof layer <b>32</b>. In a preferred configuration, the radiant barrier <b>122</b> is selected to assist in blocking heat from the vented air <b>78</b> flowing through air channel <b>36</b> from transferring through lower roof layer <b>32</b> into the attic area <b>124</b> of the building and to provide a fireproof layer. Materials suitable for radiant barrier <b>122</b> are generally well known in the industry.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">The vented wall and roof system <b>120</b> also comprises the generally vertical, planar building wall <b>126</b>, on which is attached an inner wall layer <b>128</b>, which can comprise a wood layer such as OSB sheathing or plywood. A wall radiant barrier <b>130</b> is placed over the inner wall layer <b>128</b> to, as generally with roof radiant barrier <b>122</b> for the roof, assist in preventing heat transfer into the interior of the building and to provide a fireproof layer. If desired, wall radiant barrier <b>130</b> can be the same or similar material as utilized for roof radiant barrier <b>122</b>. The outer wall layer <b>132</b> can comprise metal, wood or composite siding sufficient to cover and protect the exterior of the building. Disposed between the inner wall layer <b>128</b> and outer wall layer <b>132</b>, and generally horizontally extending (i.e., perpendicular to the vertical wall <b>126</b>), are a plurality of wall spacers <b>134</b> that define wall air flow channel <b>136</b> between inner <b>128</b> and outer <b>132</b> wall layers. Wall spacers <b>134</b> are configured to maintain the outer wall layer <b>132</b> in spaced apart relation to the inner wall layer <b>128</b>. As with the roof systems described above, in a preferred configuration wall spacers <b>134</b> comprise a metal, generally Z-shaped component having a plurality of holes therein (i.e., one and one-half inch diameter holes three inches on-center) to allow the vented air <b>78</b> to flow through the wall air flow channel <b>136</b> defined between the inner <b>128</b> and outer <b>132</b> wall layers. As with spacers <b>32</b>, wall spacers <b>134</b> can be made into a variety of shapes and out of a variety of different materials and holes <b>34</b> can have different configurations and spacing.</p>
  <p num="p-0062">The wall system of vented wall and roof system <b>120</b> also comprises a wall intake vent <b>138</b> for receiving exterior air, shown as <b>140</b>, from the exterior of the building into wall air flow channel <b>136</b>. In a preferred embodiment, wall intake vent <b>138</b> comprises a screen cover and/or a flapper valve mechanism (not specifically shown) to keep debris, bugs and small animals from entering into wall air flow channel <b>136</b>. In one configuration, the vented wall and roof system <b>12</b> comprises a plurality of wall intake vents <b>138</b> disposed near the bottom of wall <b>126</b> (i.e., near foundation <b>142</b>) and spaced apart approximately every ten feet or so to facilitate the entry of exterior air <b>140</b> into wall air flow channel <b>136</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, exterior air <b>140</b> flows into wall intake vents <b>138</b> and then the vented air <b>78</b> flows upward through wall air flow channel <b>136</b> between inner <b>128</b> and outer <b>132</b> wall layers, into roof air flow channel <b>36</b> between upper <b>24</b> and lower <b>30</b> roof layers and then into vented ridge <b>98</b> where vented air <b>78</b> is vented to the atmosphere (alternatively, the vented air can be filtered and/or otherwise treated for use as interior air <b>102</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0063">In an alternative configuration for the wall or roof systems of the vented wall and roof system <b>120</b>, a rigid or semi-rigid layer of reflective foam board insulation can be utilized in place of the lower roof layer <b>30</b> and roof radiant barrier <b>122</b> and/or in place of the inner wall layer <b>128</b> and wall radiant barrier <b>130</b>. An example of such materials is Astro-Board from RaTech Industries and Astro-Foil® from Pactiv Corp. Various other similarly configured materials can be used for the combined lower roof layer <b>30</b> and roof radiant barrier <b>122</b> and/or the combined inner wall layer <b>128</b> and wall radiant barrier <b>130</b> and, as such, are also suitable for use with vented wall and roof system <b>120</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0064">The vented wall and roof system <b>120</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is believed to be capable of venting approximately 70% or more of the heat that would otherwise be directed against the roof layer of a roof system not having the venting capabilities of the present invention (i.e., utilizing a two inch high Z-shaped spacers <b>32</b> and <b>134</b>). The embodiments of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> are believed to improve the heat dissipating capabilities of the vented wall and roof system <b>120</b> of the present invention, such that upwards of 90% or more of the heat would be vented through vented ridge <b>98</b>. Although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> refer to the components of the roof system and are provided with reference numerals that correspond thereto, those skilled in the art will readily understand that the description provided herein is equally as applicable to the corresponding components of the wall system and, therefore, the following discussion is intended to apply to both the roof and wall systems.</p>
  <p num="p-0065">In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the wall and/or roof systems comprise a larger sized spacer <b>32</b> (i.e., a four inch spacer instead of a two inch spacer) that, at least nominally, provides a larger air flow channel. Welded on or otherwise attached at or near the center of the various spacers <b>32</b> are brackets <b>144</b>, such as L-shaped angle irons, that are configured to support the ends of a generally rigid member, such as rigid insulation barrier <b>146</b>, to define an outer air channel <b>148</b> and an inner air channel <b>150</b> through which flows an outer vented air flow <b>152</b> and an inner vented air flow <b>154</b>, respectively. Various other apparatuses or devices can be utilized to support the rigid member <b>146</b> in a manner that defines the outer <b>148</b> and inner <b>150</b> air channels to direct the air flows <b>152</b>/<b>154</b> upward along wall <b>126</b> and/or along the roof installation <b>12</b>. To ensure the integrity of the air channels <b>148</b>/<b>150</b>, it is preferred that the ends of rigid member <b>146</b> are substantially sealed to prevent air flow, and therefore heat transfer, between the channels <b>148</b>/<b>150</b>. In a preferred embodiment, this can be achieved by the use of an aluminum tape or the like (which is preferred to reduce the risk of fire transfer between the two channels) that is applied to the ends of rigid member <b>146</b> where they join spacer <b>32</b>, such as at brackets <b>144</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the ends of rigid member <b>146</b> can be joined directly to spacer <b>32</b> without the use of brackets <b>144</b> using various mechanisms or devices readily known to those skilled in the art. In addition, although not shown, the system of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> can also include the roof radiant barrier <b>122</b> and/or wall radiant barrier <b>130</b> as described above.</p>
  <p num="p-0066">In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the rigid member <b>146</b> (i.e., rigid insulation barrier) is supported in spaced apart relation above lower roof layer <b>30</b> on a plurality of lower space members <b>32</b> <i>b </i>and upper roof layer <b>24</b> is supported in spaced apart relation above rigid member <b>146</b> to define outer air channel <b>148</b> and lower air channel <b>150</b>. As with the above embodiments, both upper <b>32</b> <i>a </i>and lower <b>32</b> <i>b </i>spacer members have a plurality of holes <b>34</b> therein to allow vented air <b>78</b> to flow therethrough. Like the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the use of multiple air channels through which vented air <b>78</b> passes is believed to substantially reduce the amount of heat that would be otherwise transferred into the attic area <b>124</b> of the building.</p>
  <p num="p-0067">The embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows an alternative configuration for the vented wall and roof system <b>120</b> of the present invention. In this particular embodiment, one of the air flow channels (in the figure, the outer air channel <b>148</b>) is utilized to carry water or air in a downward direction, shown as arrow <b>156</b>, so as to turn a vane-like apparatus <b>158</b> to generate electricity. In the embodiment shown, a water storage tank or other source of water <b>160</b> transfers water through discharge pipe <b>162</b> into the portion of outer air channel <b>148</b> having the vane-like apparatus <b>158</b>. Water flows down through the outer air channel, turns the vane-like apparatus and generates electricity. Preferably, it will generally not be necessary or perhaps even advisable to convert all of the outer air channels <b>148</b> to this use. Instead, it will typically only be necessary to convert a few of such channels for use to generate electricity. Water in the tank <b>160</b> can be that which is for use in the building, water previously used in the building or it can be a rainwater collection tank to collect rainwater for this use. This type of system will be particularly beneficial for use in multi-story buildings. In addition to the water flow system shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the vane apparatus <b>158</b> can also be placed in an air channel <b>148</b>/<b>150</b> such that it is rotated by the flow of air therethrough as a result of the standard venting operations described herein. To better facilitate the generation of electricity, one or more sections of the channels <b>148</b>/<b>150</b> that are designated for this use can be somewhat narrowed to increase the velocity of the vented air <b>78</b> past the vane apparatus <b>158</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0068">Although shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> as being hydraulically connected to the roof venting system, the wall venting system can also be utilized without being connected to the roof, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The roof can be provided with the venting system <b>10</b> described above, with its own intake of exterior air <b>140</b>, and the wall <b>126</b> can be provided with a similarly configured, but hydraulically separate, wall venting system (such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). In such a configuration, exterior air <b>140</b> would enter into the roof air flow channel <b>36</b> through the intake vent <b>68</b> at facia member <b>66</b> and exterior air <b>140</b> would enter into the wall air flow channel <b>136</b> at wall intake vent <b>138</b> generally at or near the bottom end <b>164</b> of wall <b>126</b>. The vented air <b>78</b> from the roof system could be vented to the environment at ridge vent <b>98</b> or reused as described above. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the vented air <b>78</b> in wall air flow channel <b>136</b> is discharged through a discharge vent <b>166</b> at or near the top end <b>168</b> of wall <b>126</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in contrast, the discharge vent <b>166</b> provides the connection between the wall air flow channel <b>136</b> and roof air flow channel <b>36</b> so the vented air can be used in the building or discharged from ridge vent <b>98</b> as described above for the roof venting system <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0069">The vented wall and roof system <b>120</b> of the present invention is particularly beneficial for buildings having metal roofs and walls, although those buildings having roofs and walls made out of other materials, including composite materials, will also benefit from the present system <b>120</b>. Typically, the benefits of the convection of the heated air upward through an air flow channel <b>36</b> in the roof benefits from the slope of the roof, with an increasing slope generally producing improved convection results. Because many metal roofs tend to have a low slope or pitch, suction fans or the like (particularly a small solar fan) can be utilized to pull air through air flow channel <b>36</b> to improve the flow of vented air <b>78</b> therein.</p>
  <p num="p-0070">While there are shown and described herein certain specific alternative forms of the invention, it will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention is not so limited, but is susceptible to various modifications and rearrangements in design and materials without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. In particular, it should be noted that the present invention is subject to modification with regard to the dimensional relationships set forth herein and modifications in assembly, materials, size, shape, and use. For instance, as is readily understood by those skilled in the art, there are numerous components described herein that can be replaced with equivalent functioning components to accomplish the objectives of the present invention.</p>
