    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>The present invention relates in general to operating devices for operating automotive doors, and more particularly to operating devices of a type which opens and closes an automotive pivotal door.</p>
    <p>2. Description of the Related art</p>
    <p>In order to clarify the task of the present invention, some known operating devices for automotive pivotal doors will be briefly described before commencing the detailed explanation of the present invention.</p>
    <p>Japanese Utility Model First Provisional Publication 6-71852 shows an operating device for a pivotal back door of a motor vehicle. The operating device generally comprises an electric motor which is mounted on a body of the vehicle, a pinion which is driven by the motor, a sector gear which is meshed with the pinion and pivotally held by the vehicle body and a rod member which has one end pivotally connected to the sector gear and the other pivotally connected to the pivotal back door. Upon operation of the electric motor, the pinion pivots the sector gear in one or the other direction thereby to push or pull the pivotal back door through the rod member. With this, the pivotal back door is swung toward an open or close position. For the pivotal movement of the rod member relative to both the sector gear and the pivotal back door, there are employed ball-joints respectively.</p>
    <p>Japanese Patent First Provisional Publication 9-125820 shows a so-called semi-automatic operating device for an automotive door. That is, when, due to manual handling by an operator, the door is moved slightly toward an open or close position, the operating device senses the movement and then moves the door in the desired direction by force of an electric motor. The publication further shows a technique that avoids or lessens a shock which would be sensed by the operator when the door operation switches from the manual handling to the auto-driving. More specifically, by the technique, only when the moving speed of the door in the manual driving is within a predetermined range, the auto-driving follows. Thus, when the movement of the door by the manual handling is excessively high in speed at the beginning of door operation, the auto-driving for the door does not take place. That is, in this case, opening or closing of the door is entirely carried out by manual labor.</p>
    <p>However, due to their inherent constructions, even the above-mentioned known operating devices have failed to provide users with a satisfaction. That is, in the former device, usage of the ball-joints brings about a complicated and costly construction, and in the latter device, even if the movement of the door by the manual handling is adequately slow, the auto-driving for the door suddenly takes place when the manual movement is kept for over a certain time, which produces a certain shock sensed by the operator.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an operating device for an automotive door, which is free of the above-mentioned drawbacks.</p>
    <p>According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an operating device for operating a pivotal door, which comprises an electric motor of reversible type; a speed reduction device driven by the motor, the speed reduction device having an output part formed into an output gear; a rack member having a toothed side edge meshed with the output gear, so that upon energization of the motor, the rack member is moved axially; a motion transmitting member having one end pivotally connected to one end of the rack member and the other end connected to the pivotal door; and a structure which permits a swing movement of the rack member about an axis of the output gear when an external force is applied to the rack member in a direction to swing the same during the axial movement of the rack member.</p>
    <p>According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided an operating device for use in a motor vehicle having a pivotal door which is pivotally connected at its upper end to a rear end of a roof of the vehicle. The operating device operates the pivotal door and comprises an electric motor of reversible type mounted on the rear end portion of the roof; a speed reduction device connected to and driven by the motor, the speed reduction device having an output part formed into an output gear; a rack member having a toothed side edge meshed with the output gear, so that upon energization of the motor, the rack member is moved axially; a motion transmitting member having one end pivotally connected to one end of the rack member and the other end connected to the pivotal door; a holding member for holding the rack member permitting the axial movement of the rack member relative thereto, the holding member being held by the speed reduction device in a manner to be pivotal about the axis of the output gear; two rollers rotatably connected to the holding member, each roller putting thereon the other side edge of the rack member; a cover member connected to the holding member to define therebetween a space through which the rack member axially moves; an outer slider of plastics disposed between the rack member and the cover member to smooth the axial movement of the rack member relative to the cover member; an inner slider of plastics disposed between the rack member and the holding member to smooth the axial movement of the rack member relative to the holding member; and a biasing member held by the holding member to bias the rack member toward the output gear to assure the meshed engagement between the rack member and the output gear.</p>
    <p>According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided an operating device for use in a motor vehicle having a pivotal door which is pivotally connected at its upper end to a rear end of a roof of the vehicle. The operating device operates the pivotal door and comprises an electric motor of reversible type mounted on the rear end portion of the roof; a speed reduction device connected to and driven by the motor, the speed reduction device having an output part formed into an output gear; a rack member having a toothed side edge meshed with the output gear, so that upon energization of the motor, the rack member is moved axially; a motion transmitting member having one end pivotally connected to one end of the rack member and the other end connected to the pivotal door; a single roller rotatably connected to a case of the speed reduction device to put thereon the other side edge of the rack member, the roller being arranged to permit a pivotal movement of the rack member about the axis of the output gear; a cover member connected to the case of the speed reduction device to define therebetween a space through which the rack member axially moves; an outer slider of plastics disposed between the rack member and the cover member to smooth the axial movement of the rack member relative to the cover member; an inner slider of plastics disposed between the rack member and the case of the speed reduction device to smooth the axial movement of the rack member relative to the case; and a biasing member held by the case of the speed reduction device to bias the rack member toward the output gear to assure the meshed engagement between the rack member and the output gear.</p>

The lock device <b>5</b> is equipped with an electric actuator which can cancel the engagement between the lock device <b>5</b> and the striker upon being energized.</p>
    <p>A pair of gas-stays <b>6</b> are arranged between the vehicle body <b>1</b> and the back door <b>3</b>. Each gas-stay <b>6</b> has an upper end <b>6</b> <i>a </i>pivotally connected to the back door <b>3</b> and a lower end <b>6</b> <i>b </i>pivotally connected to the vehicle body <b>1</b>. Preferably, for the pivotal connection, ball-joints are used. Each gas-stay <b>6</b> contains therein a compressed gas by which a cylinder having the lower end <b>6</b> <i>b </i>and a piston rod having the upper end <b>6</b> <i>a </i>are biased in opposite directions, that is, in a direction to increase the length of the gas-stay <b>6</b>. During the pivotal movement of the back door <b>3</b>, the upper end <b>6</b> <i>a </i>of each gas-stay <b>6</b> turns about the hinge pin axis <b>4</b> <i>a </i>while describing an arc about the lower end <b>6</b> <i>b </i>that is pivotally connected to the vehicle body <b>1</b>. Thus, during the pivotal movement of the back door <b>3</b> between the full-close position “B” and the full-open position “A”s, each gas-stay <b>6</b> is subjected to a telescopic motion biasing the back door <b>3</b> in the opening direction or in the closing direction. It is to be noted that the neutral position “C” of the back door <b>3</b> is a position wherein the own weight of the back door <b>3</b> is balanced with the biasing force produced by the two gas-stays <b>6</b>. More specifically, when the back door <b>3</b> assumes a half-open position above the neutral position “C”, the gas-stays <b>6</b> function to bias the back door <b>3</b> toward the full-open position “A”, while, when the back door <b>3</b> assumes a half-open position below the neutral position “C”, the gas-stays <b>6</b> function to bias the back door <b>3</b> toward the full-close position “B”.</p>
    <p>Thus, in order to open the back door <b>3</b> which assumes the full-close position “B”, engaged engagement between the lock device <b>5</b> and the striker is cancelled first, and then a certain external force is applied to the back door <b>3</b> to lift up the same to a position just above the neutral position “C”. With this, the back door <b>3</b> is automatically lifted up to the full-open position “A” by the force of the gas-stays <b>6</b>.</p>
    <p>While, in order to close the back door <b>3</b> which assumes the full-open position “A”, a certain force is applied to the back door <b>3</b> to pivot down the same to a position just below the neutral position “C” against the force of the gas-stays <b>6</b>. With this, the back door <b>3</b> is automatically pivoted down to the full-close position “B” by the newly produced force of the gas-stays <b>6</b>.</p>
    <p>As will be described in detail hereinafter, due to provision of the gas-stays <b>6</b>, the operating device <b>8</b> of the invention for the back door <b>3</b> can function normally irrespective of a small driving force produced thereby.</p>
    <p>As is understood from FIGS. 1 and 2, on a rear end corner of a roof panel <b>7</b> of the vehicle body <b>1</b>, there is mounted the operating device <b>8</b> through brackets <b>8</b> <i>a</i>, which is the first embodiment of the present invention. Although not shown in the drawings, an interior trim is arranged beneath the roof panel <b>7</b> to conceal the operating device <b>8</b> from the interior of the vehicle body <b>1</b>.</p>
    <p>The operating device <b>8</b> comprises a reversible type electric motor <b>10</b> which is connected to a speed reduction device <b>11</b> mounted on the brackets <b>8</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p>As is seen from FIG. 8, within a case <b>11</b> <i>a </i>of the speed reduction device <b>11</b>, there are mounted various parts of the device <b>11</b>. That is, a larger diameter first gear <b>11</b> <i>b </i>is meshed with a pinion <b>10</b> <i>a </i>driven by the motor <b>10</b>. A smaller diameter gear part <b>11</b> <i>b</i>′ of the first gear <b>11</b> <i>b </i>is meshed with an input gear <b>11</b> <i>c</i>′ of an electromagnetic clutch <b>11</b> <i>c </i>which functions to break and connect a torque transmission from the motor <b>10</b>. An output gear <b>11</b> <i>c</i>″ of the clutch <b>11</b> <i>c </i>is meshed with a larger diameter second gear <b>11</b> <i>e</i>. An input gear <b>11</b> <i>d</i>′ of a rotary encoder <b>11</b> <i>d </i>is engaged with the second gear <b>11</b> <i>e</i>, which produces a pulse signal representing the rotation manner of the second gear <b>11</b> <i>e</i>, that is, the moving manner of the back door <b>3</b>. A smaller diameter gear part <b>11</b> <i>e</i>′ of the second gear <b>11</b> <i>e </i>is meshed with a larger diameter gear part of a pinion <b>13</b>. The pinion <b>13</b> is provided with an output gear <b>13</b> <i>a </i>which is projected outward from the case <b>11</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p>The rotary encoder <b>11</b> <i>d </i>thus detects the number of rotation of the output gear <b>13</b> <i>a</i>, which is used for controlling the operating device <b>8</b>. Since the input gear <b>11</b> <i>d</i>′ of the rotary encoder <b>11</b> <i>d </i>is arranged to rotate with the output gear <b>11</b> <i>c</i>″ of the electromagnetic clutch <b>11</b> <i>c</i>, the rotary encoder <b>11</b> <i>d </i>can sense the rotation of the output gear <b>13</b> <i>a </i>caused by a manual handling to the back door <b>3</b>. That is, under such movement of the back door <b>3</b> by the manual handling, the clutch <b>11</b> <i>c </i>breaks the torque transmission from the motor <b>10</b> to the output gear <b>11</b> <i>c</i>″ permitting a free rotation of the output gear <b>11</b> <i>c″. </i> </p>
    <p>Referring back to FIG. 2, the operating device <b>8</b> further comprises a rack member <b>14</b> which is meshed at its tooth portion <b>14</b> <i>a </i>with the above-mentioned output gear <b>13</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p>As is seen from FIGS. 3 and 5, the rack member <b>14</b> is longitudinally slidably held by a holding member <b>15</b>. The holding member <b>15</b> is held by the case <b>11</b> <i>a </i>of the speed reduction device <b>11</b> in a manner to be swingable about the axis of the output gear <b>13</b> <i>a</i>. That is, as is seen from FIG. 5, the holding member <b>15</b> has an opening <b>15</b> <i>b </i>which is rotatably received on an annular projection <b>11</b> <i>a</i>′ of the case <b>11</b> <i>a </i>through an annular bearing member <b>12</b>. A leading end of a shaft <b>13</b> <i>b </i>for the pinion <b>13</b> (and thus for the output gear <b>13</b> <i>a</i>) passes through the annular projection <b>11</b> <i>b</i>. Thus, the holding member <b>15</b> can swing about the annular projection <b>11</b> <i>b</i>, that is, about the axis of the outer gear <b>13</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p>As is seen from FIGS. 2 and 5, the holding member <b>15</b> is concealed by a cover member <b>16</b>.</p>
    <p>As is seen from FIGS. 9 and 10, the holding member <b>15</b> is provided at its lower portion with two spaced rollers <b>17</b> which support thereon a lower edge <b>14</b> <i>b </i>of the rack member <b>14</b>. The two rollers <b>17</b> are spaced from the output gear <b>13</b> <i>a </i>by the same distance. Each roller <b>17</b> is rotatably disposed on a roller pin <b>17</b> <i>a </i>fixed to the holding member <b>15</b>.</p>
    <p>As is seen from FIGS. 3 and 5, the cover member <b>16</b> has an upper portion bolted to holding member <b>15</b> and a lower portion fixed to leading ends of the roller pins <b>17</b> <i>a</i>. Thus, the holding member <b>15</b>, the two rollers <b>17</b> and the cover member <b>16</b> constitute a unit which is swingable about the axis of the output gear <b>13</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p>As is seen from FIG. 5, an outer slider <b>18</b> of polyacetal resin is disposed between the rack member <b>14</b> and the cover member <b>16</b> to smooth the movement of the rack member <b>14</b> relative to the cover member <b>16</b>. As is seen from FIGS. 5 and 10, an inner slider <b>19</b> of polyacetal resin, which has an oval-ring shape, is disposed between the holding member <b>15</b> and the rack member <b>14</b> to smooth the movement of the rack member <b>14</b> relative to the holding member <b>15</b>.</p>
    <p>As is seen from FIGS. 5, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>, the holding member <b>15</b> is formed, at the portion where the oval-ring shaped inner slider <b>19</b> is arranged, with a recess <b>15</b> <i>a </i>which has a biasing member <b>20</b> of rubber press-fitted therein. Due to provision of the biasing member <b>20</b>, the rack member <b>14</b> is constantly biased toward the rollers <b>17</b>, so that the tooth portion <b>14</b> <i>a </i>of the rack member <b>14</b> is appropriately meshed with the output gear <b>13</b> <i>a </i>of the speed reduction device <b>11</b>. If desired, in place of the rubber-made biasing member <b>20</b>, other member, such as a coil spring, a plate spring or the like may be used.</p>
    <p>As is seen from FIGS. 2 and 3, to a right end <b>14</b> <i>c </i>of the rack member <b>14</b>, there is secured a connecting member <b>14</b> <i>d </i>which, as is seen from FIG. 4, can be projected at its right end to the outside of the vehicle body through an opening <b>2</b> <i>a </i>formed in the vehicle body <b>1</b>. The right end of the connecting member <b>14</b> <i>d </i>is pivotally connected to a leading end of an arm member <b>3</b> <i>a </i>through a pivot pin <b>14</b> <i>e</i>. The arm member <b>3</b> <i>a </i>is secured at its base portion to an upper side portion of the back door <b>3</b>. If desired, the connecting member <b>14</b> <i>d </i>may be integral with the rack member <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p>The motor <b>10</b> and the speed reduction device <b>11</b> constitute a drive unit “U”.</p>
    <p>As is seen from FIG. 7, the operating device <b>8</b> has a generally L-shaped structure when viewed from the top of the vehicle body <b>1</b>. That is, the rack member <b>14</b> extends in the fore-and-aft direction of the vehicle body <b>1</b>, and the electric motor <b>10</b> is arranged to extend perpendicular to the rack member <b>14</b>. Thus, because of the L-shaped structure, the operating device <b>8</b> can be neatly arranged on a rear corner of the roof panel <b>7</b>, as shown. That is, the bulky drive unit “U” including the rack member <b>14</b>, the motor <b>10</b> and the speed reduction device <b>11</b> can be positioned away from a passenger's head “H”, and thus the passenger room can be provided with a satisfied head clearance.</p>
    <p>In the following, operation of the operating device <b>8</b> of the first embodiment will be described with reference to the drawings.</p>
    <p>For ease of understanding, the description will be commenced with respect to the full-close position “B” of the back door <b>3</b>, which is shown by a solid line in FIG. <b>1</b>. In this condition, the lock device <b>5</b> is engaged with the striker and the operating device <b>8</b> assumes such a condition as shown in FIG. 3, that is, a condition wherein the rack member <b>14</b> assumes its frontmost position.</p>
    <p>When now a manual control switch <b>24</b> (see FIG. 16) is actuated in a normal direction, that is, a direction to open the back door <b>3</b>, the actuator cancels the engagement of the lock device <b>5</b> with the striker and at the same time, the electric motor <b>10</b> of the operating device <b>8</b> is rotated in a normal direction and thus the output gear <b>13</b> of the speed reduction device <b>11</b> is rotated in a counterclockwise direction in FIG. <b>3</b>. Upon this, the rack member <b>14</b> is slid rearward that is rightward in FIG. <b>3</b>. Thus, finally, the back door <b>3</b> is pushed up to the full-open position “A”, as shown in FIG. <b>4</b>. During this opening movement of the back door <b>3</b>, the operating device <b>8</b> can reduce its output force at the time when the back door <b>3</b> comes to the neutral position “C” (see FIG. 1) due to the above-mentioned function of the gas-stays <b>6</b>.</p>
    <p>During the rearward movement of the rack member <b>14</b>, the pivot pin <b>14</b> <i>e </i>of the connecting member <b>14</b> <i>d </i>is forced to make a swing movement about the hinge pin axis <b>4</b> <i>a</i>, which applies a certain force to the rack member <b>14</b> in a direction to swing the same. Thus, the rack member <b>14</b> is swung together with the holding member <b>15</b> about the axis of the output gear <b>13</b> <i>a </i>during the rearward movement of the rack member <b>14</b>. That is, the rack member <b>14</b> and the holding member <b>15</b> are forced to swing about the axis of the output gear <b>13</b> <i>a </i>relative to the case <b>11</b> <i>a </i>of the speed reduction device <b>11</b>.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, during the rearward movement of the rack member <b>14</b>, the right end <b>14</b> <i>c </i>of the rack member <b>14</b> can swing to smoothly follow the swinging movement of the pivot pin <b>14</b> <i>e </i>to which the arm member <b>3</b> <i>a </i>of the back door <b>3</b> is pivotally connected. In the illustrated first embodiment, the holding member <b>15</b> is swung by an angle of about 10 degrees when the back door <b>3</b> is pivoted from the full-close position “B” to the full-open position “A”. It is to be noted that the maximum inclination of the rack member <b>14</b> corresponds to the inclination of an imaginary tangential line that contacts both a pitch circle of the output gear <b>13</b> <i>a </i>and a locus described by the pivot pin <b>14</b> <i>e. </i> </p>
    <p>As is seen from FIG. 4, when the back door <b>3</b> assumes the full-open position “A”, the rack member <b>14</b> assumes its rearmost position.</p>
    <p>When, now, the manual control switch is actuated in a reverse direction, that is a direction to close the back door <b>3</b>, the electric motor <b>10</b> is rotated in a reverse direction. With this, the rack member <b>14</b> is slid forward that is leftward in FIG. 4, pulling the back door <b>3</b> toward the full-close position “B” and finally to the full-close position “B”. Upon this, the lock device <b>5</b> of the door <b>3</b> becomes engaged with the striker thereby latching the back door <b>3</b> at the full-close position “B”.</p>
    <p>During the forward movement, the rack member <b>14</b> is forced to swing together with the holding member <b>15</b>, like in the manner as is described hereinabove.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIGS. 11 to <b>15</b>, there is shown an operating device <b>28</b> of a second embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p>Since the operating device of the second embodiment is similar to that of the above-mentioned first embodiment, only parts and portions which are different from those of the first embodiment will be described in the following. Similar parts and portions are denoted by the same numerals as those in the first embodiment.</p>
    <p>As is seen from FIGS. 11 and 12, like in the first embodiment, on a rear end corner of a roof panel <b>7</b>, there is mounted the operating device <b>28</b> of the second embodiment.</p>
    <p>As is seen from FIGS. 11, <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>, in this second embodiment, there is no member corresponding to the holding member <b>15</b> used in the first embodiment. That is, only one roller <b>37</b> is employed for supporting thereon the lower edge <b>14</b> <i>a </i>of the rack member <b>14</b>. The roller <b>37</b> is rotatably held by a fixed cover member <b>36</b> which is bolted at its upper portions to the case <b>11</b> <i>a </i>of the speed reduction device <b>11</b>. As is best shown in FIG. 13, the roller pin <b>37</b> <i>a </i>for the roller <b>37</b> extends between the case <b>11</b> <i>a </i>and the cover member <b>36</b>.</p>
    <p>It is thus to be noted that unlike the cover member <b>16</b> of the first embodiment, the cover member <b>36</b> of the second embodiment is not swingable about the axis of the output gear <b>13</b> <i>a</i>. However, due to the nature of a so-called one point support effected by the roller <b>37</b>, the rack member <b>14</b> can swing on the roller <b>37</b> using the same as a fulcrum.</p>
    <p>As is seen from FIG. 13, an outer slider <b>38</b> of polyacetal resin is disposed between the rack member <b>14</b> and the cover member <b>36</b> to smooth the movement of the rack member <b>14</b>. As is seen from FIGS. 13 and 15, and an inner slider <b>39</b> of polyacetal resin, which has an oval-ring shape, is disposed between the case <b>11</b> <i>a </i>and the rack member <b>14</b> for smoothing the movement of the rack member <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p>As is seen from FIGS. 13 and 15, the case <b>11</b> <i>a </i>is formed, at the portion where the oval-ring shaped inner slider <b>39</b> is arranged, with a recess <b>11</b> <i>f </i>which has a pressing member <b>40</b> of rubber press-fitted therein. Due to provision of the pressing member <b>40</b>, the rack member <b>14</b> is constantly biased toward the roller <b>37</b>, so that the tooth portion <b>14</b> <i>a </i>of the rack member <b>14</b> is appropriately meshed with the output gear <b>13</b> <i>a </i>of the speed reduction device <b>11</b>. If desired, in place of the rubber-made pressing member <b>40</b>, other member, such as a coil spring, a plate spring or the like may be used.</p>
    <p>In the following, operation of the operating device <b>28</b> of the second embodiment will be described with reference to the drawings, particularly FIGS. 11 and 12.</p>
    <p>When the back door <b>3</b> assumes the full-close position “B” as shown in FIG. 11, the rack member <b>14</b> assumes its frontmost position.</p>
    <p>When now a manual control switch is actuated in a normal direction, the electric motor <b>10</b> is rotated and thus the rack member <b>14</b> is slid rearward that is rightward in FIG. <b>11</b>. Thus, finally, the back door <b>3</b> is pushed up to the full-open position “A”, as shown in FIG. <b>12</b>. During this opening movement of the back door <b>3</b>, the operating device <b>28</b> can reduce its output force at the time when the back door <b>3</b> comes to the neutral position “C” (see FIG. 1) due to the above-mentioned function of the gas-stays <b>6</b>.</p>
    <p>During the rearward movement of the rack member <b>14</b>, the pivot pin <b>14</b> <i>e </i>of the connecting member <b>14</b> <i>d </i>is forced to make a swing movement about the hinge pin axis <b>4</b> <i>a</i>, like in the case of the above-mentioned first embodiment. Thus, the rack member <b>14</b> is swung on the roller <b>37</b> using the same as a fulcrum, during the rearward movement of the rack member <b>14</b>. That is, the rack member <b>14</b> is forced to swing on the roller <b>37</b> relative to the case <b>11</b> <i>a </i>of the speed reduction device <b>11</b>.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, during the rearward movement of the rack member <b>14</b>, the right end <b>14</b> <i>c </i>of the rack member <b>14</b> can swing to smoothly follow the swinging movement of the pivot pin <b>14</b> <i>e </i>to which the arm member <b>3</b> <i>a </i>of the back door <b>3</b> is pivotally connected. Similar to the case of the first embodiment, the rack member <b>14</b> can swing by an angle of about 10 degrees when the back door <b>3</b> is pivoted form the full-close position “B” to the full-open position “A”.</p>
    <p>Since a reverse operation effected when the back door <b>3</b> is pivoted from the full-open position “A” to the full-close position “B” is substantially the same as the above-mentioned operation except for the moving direction of the parts, description of such reverse operation will be omitted.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 16, there is shown a block diagram of a control system for controlling the above-mentioned operating device <b>8</b> or <b>28</b>. Denoted by numeral <b>25</b> is control unit of the system, which is a microcomputer comprising generally CPU, RAM, ROM and input and output interfaces.</p>
    <p>Denoted by numeral <b>24</b> is a manual control switch <b>24</b> which is arranged in the vicinity of a driver's seat or a position near the back door <b>3</b>. The switch <b>24</b> comprises a switch circuit <b>24</b> <i>a </i>for opening the back door <b>3</b> and another switch circuit <b>24</b> <i>b </i>for closing the back door <b>3</b>. Denoted by numeral <b>26</b> is a battery which is a power source. The rotary encoder <b>11</b> <i>d </i>detects the movement of the back door <b>3</b> by counting pulses produced by a pulse generator which is driven by the input gear <b>11</b> <i>d</i>′ (see FIG. 8) when the back door <b>3</b> pivots.</p>
    <p>The control unit <b>25</b> comprises a main control section <b>27</b> which controls the output in accordance with instruction signals applied thereto from the manual control switch <b>24</b> and the rotary encoder <b>11</b> <i>d</i>. At an input side of the main control section <b>27</b>, there is arranged a calculation section <b>128</b> which processes the pulse signals from the rotary encoder <b>11</b> <i>d </i>and feed the processed signals to the main control section <b>27</b>. At an output side of the main control section <b>27</b>, there are arranged a speed control section <b>29</b>, a door opening driving section <b>30</b> and a door closing driving section <b>31</b> which control the motor <b>10</b> in accordance with output signals from the main control section <b>27</b>, and a clutch driving section <b>32</b> which controls the electromagnetic clutch <b>11</b> <i>c </i>(see FIG. 8) in accordance with an output signal from the main control section <b>27</b>. That is, the manual control switch <b>24</b> and the rotary encoder <b>11</b> <i>d </i>are devices which generate information signals applied to an input part of the control unit <b>25</b>, and the motor <b>10</b> and the electromagnetic clutch <b>11</b> <i>c </i>are devices which are controlled by instruction signals issued from the control unit <b>25</b>. The battery <b>26</b> is arranged to energize the control unit <b>25</b> and the motor <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>The rotary encoder <b>11</b> <i>d </i>is constructed to generate two types of pulse signals whose phases are different from each other by 90 degrees. By processing these signals, the calculation section <b>128</b> calculates various data of the back door <b>3</b> which will be described in the following.</p>
    <p>Under pivoting of the back door <b>3</b>, the rotary encoder <b>11</b> <i>d </i>generates the pulse signals that are applied to the calculation section <b>128</b> of the control unit <b>25</b>. In the calculation section <b>128</b>, the pulse signals from the rotary encoder <b>11</b> <i>d </i>are processed to calculate the position, moved distance, moving speed, acceleration and moving direction of the back door <b>3</b>. These data are led into the main control section <b>27</b>. The moving speed and the acceleration of the back door <b>3</b> are derived by applying primary and secondary differentiation to the moved distance with time respectively. Thus, the rotary encoder <b>11</b> <i>d </i>and the calculation section <b>128</b> constitute a section which comprises a speed detecting means and an acceleration detecting means.</p>
    <p>From the main control section <b>27</b>, there is issued a drive control signal to either one of the door opening driving section <b>30</b> and the door closing driving section <b>31</b> to cause the section <b>30</b> or <b>31</b> to output a drive current having a decided flow direction. After being modified by an instruction signal from the speed control section <b>29</b>, the drive current is applied to the electric motor <b>10</b>. At the same time, from the main control section <b>27</b>, there is also issued a drive signal to the clutch driving section <b>32</b>, and from the clutch driving section <b>32</b>, there is issued a driving current to the electromagnetic clutch <b>11</b> <i>c </i>to drive the same.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 17, there is shown a flowchart of programmed operation steps which are executed in the control unit <b>25</b> for controlling the pivoting movement of the back door <b>3</b> in a direction to close the same. More specifically, the flowchart shows the control of the back door <b>3</b> from the time when the door <b>3</b> in a larger open position is pushed down by the manual handling to the time when the door <b>3</b> is brought to the full-close position “B” by the auto-driving.</p>
    <p>At step S<b>1</b>, judgement is carried out as to whether the back door <b>3</b> is being pivoted in the closing direction or not. If YES, that is, when the back door <b>3</b> is being pivoted in the closing direction, the operation flow goes to step S<b>2</b>. The YES judgment at step S<b>1</b> is actually provided when, with both the door opening driving section <b>30</b> and the door closing driving section <b>31</b> being kept inoperative, the rotary encoder <b>11</b> <i>d </i>senses a given degree of the moved distance of the back door <b>3</b>.</p>
    <p>If NO at step S<b>1</b>, that is, when the back door <b>3</b> is not being pivoted downward, the operation flow goes back to START.</p>
    <p>At step S<b>2</b>, judgement is carried out as to whether or not the back door <b>3</b> under closing pivoting has come to a position below the neutral position “C”. If YES, that is, when the back door <b>3</b> has come to such a lower position through the neutral position “C”, the operation flow goes to END. That is, when the back door <b>3</b> comes down to such a lower position below the neutral position “C”, the door <b>3</b> would be automatically pivoted down to the full-close position “B” due to the biasing force composed of the own weight of the back door <b>3</b> and the biasing force produced by the gas-stays <b>6</b>. Thus, in this case, there is no need of using a power of the operating device <b>8</b> (or <b>28</b>) for moving down the back door <b>3</b> to the full-close position “B”.</p>
    <p>If NO at step S<b>2</b>, that is, when the back door <b>3</b> is still at a position above the neutral position “C”, the operation flow goes to step S<b>3</b>.</p>
    <p>At this step S<b>3</b>, judgement is carried out as to whether the downward pivoting of the back door <b>3</b> is under acceleration or not. If YES, that is, when the downward pivoting of the back door <b>3</b> is under acceleration, the operation flow goes back to START. The YES judgement at step S<b>3</b> is actually provided when the acceleration derived by the calculation section <b>128</b> of the control unit <b>25</b> shows a positive value, that is, in a condition wherein the back door <b>3</b> is being pivoted downward manually by an operator. If, under this condition, the manual downward pivoting of the door <b>3</b> starts to be assisted by the power of the operating device <b>8</b> (or <b>28</b>), uncomfortable shock would be applied to the operator. Thus, if the downward pivoting of the back door <b>3</b> is under acceleration, the auto-driving for the door <b>3</b> by the operating device <b>8</b> (or <b>28</b>) is not induced. In other words, the auto-driving for the door <b>3</b> takes place only when the downward pivoting of the door <b>3</b> shows no acceleration, that is, in a condition wherein the operator is forced to temporarily remove his or her door moving force at the time when the door <b>3</b> comes down to a position near the neutral position “C”. That is, at such time, the operator is forced to change the door gripping manner in which his or her hand grasps the lower end of the back door <b>3</b>. When the auto-driving by the operating device <b>8</b> (or <b>28</b>) is commenced at such time, no shock is applied to the operator. For achieving this advantage, the step S<b>3</b> is provided.</p>
    <p>If NO at step <b>53</b>, that is, when the downward pivoting of the back door <b>3</b> is not under acceleration, the operation flow goes to step S<b>4</b>.</p>
    <p>At this step S<b>4</b>, judgment is carried out as to whether the moving speed of the back door <b>3</b> is within a given range or not. If YES, that is, when the door moving speed is within the given range, the operation flow goes to step S<b>5</b>. The YES judgment as step S<b>4</b> is actually provided when the moving speed derived by the calculating section <b>128</b> of the control unit <b>25</b> is within a certain range, that is, in a condition wherein the moving speed is lower than a higher given speed that does not provide the operator with a marked shock upon switching to the auto-driving and higher than a lower given speed that is provided by the manual handling of the door <b>3</b> by the operator.</p>
    <p>If NO at step S<b>4</b>, that is, when the moving speed of the back door <b>3</b> is not within the given range, the operation flow goes back to START.</p>
    <p>At step S<b>5</b>, the electric motor <b>10</b> is energized and then the operation flow goes to step S<b>6</b> to engage the electromagnetic clutch <b>11</b> <i>c</i>. That is, in this operating order, the motor <b>10</b> has already rotated when the clutch <b>11</b> <i>c </i>begins to engage. Thus, the torque of the motor <b>10</b> is smoothly transmitted to the rack member <b>14</b> of the operating device <b>8</b> (or <b>28</b>) upon switching from the manual handling of the back door <b>3</b> to the auto-driving of the same. Due to the steps of S<b>5</b> and S<b>6</b>, the pivoting of the back door <b>3</b> toward the full-close position “B” is carried out by the force produced by the operating device <b>8</b> (or <b>28</b>). The moving speed of the back door <b>3</b> at this time is set higher than the higher given speed provided at the step S<b>4</b>, so that the switching from the manual handling to the auto-driving produces substantially no shock.</p>
    <p>After the step S<b>6</b>, the operation flow goes to step S<b>7</b>. At this step S<b>7</b>, judgment is carried out as to whether or not the back door <b>3</b> has come down to a given position at which braking of the downward pivoting of the door <b>3</b> should start. If NO, that is, when the back door <b>3</b> has not come to the given position yet, the operation flow goes back to the front of the step S<b>7</b>, and the judgement work is repeated until the back door <b>3</b> comes to the given position. The given position is derived by processing the information signal from the rotary encoder <b>11</b> <i>d </i>by the calculation section <b>128</b>.</p>
    <p>If YES at step S<b>7</b>, that is, when the back door <b>3</b> has come down to the given position, the operation flow goes to step S<b>8</b> to brake the downward movement of the back door <b>3</b>. Actually, the rotation of the motor <b>10</b> is braked. With this, the downward movement of the door <b>3</b> is decelerated. Then, the operation flow goes to step S<b>9</b>.</p>
    <p>At step S<b>9</b>, judgement is carried out as to whether the back door <b>3</b> has come down to the full-close position “B” or not. If NO, that is, when the back door <b>3</b> has not come to the full-close position “B” yet, the operation flow goes back to the front of the step S<b>9</b> and the judgement work is repeated until the back door <b>3</b> comes to the full-close position “B”. Like in the step S<b>7</b>, the full-close position “B” is derived by processing the information signal from the rotary encoder <b>11</b> <i>d </i>by the calculation section <b>128</b>.</p>
    <p>If YES at step S<b>9</b>, that is, when the back door <b>3</b> has come to the full-close position “B”, the operation flow goes to step S<b>10</b> to disengage the electromagnetic clutch <b>11</b> <i>c </i>and then to step S<b>11</b> to deenergize the motor <b>10</b>. That is, upon receiving OFF signal from the main control section <b>27</b> (see FIG. <b>16</b>), the clutch driving section <b>32</b> forces the clutch <b>11</b> <i>c </i>to take its OFF or disengaged condition and upon receiving a stop signal from the main control section <b>27</b>, the door closing driving section <b>31</b> forces the motor <b>10</b> to take its OFF condition.</p>
    <p>With the above-mentioned steps, the back door <b>3</b> is finally pivoted to the full-close position “B”. Actually, when the door <b>3</b> comes to the full-close position “B”, the lock device <b>5</b> (see FIG. 1) becomes engaged with the striker to latch the door <b>3</b> in the full-close position “B”.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 18, there is shown a flowchart for controlling the pivoting movement of the back door <b>3</b> in a direction to open the same. That is, the flowchart shows the control of the back door <b>3</b> from the time when the door <b>3</b> in a smaller open position is pulled up by the manual handling to the time when the door <b>3</b> is brought to the full-open position “A” by the auto-driving.</p>
    <p>As step S<b>11</b>, judgement is carried out as to whether the back <b>3</b> is being pivoted in the opening direction or not. If YES, that is, the back door <b>3</b> is being pivoted in the opening direction, the operation flow goes to step S<b>12</b>. If NO at step S<b>11</b>, that is, when the back door <b>3</b> is not being pivoted upward, the operation flow goes back to START.</p>
    <p>At step S<b>12</b>, judgement is carried out as to whether or not the back door <b>3</b> under opening pivoting has come to a position above the neutral position “C”. If YES, that is, when the back door <b>3</b> has come to such a higher position through the neutral position “C”, the operation flow goes to END. That is, when the back door <b>3</b> comes up to such a higher position above the neutral position “C”, the door <b>3</b> would be automatically pivoted up to the full-open position “A” due to the biasing force produced by the gas-stays <b>6</b> against the weight of the door <b>3</b>. Thus, in this case, there is no need of using a power of the operating device <b>8</b> (or <b>28</b>) for moving up the back door <b>3</b> to the full-open position “A”.</p>
    <p>If NO at step S<b>12</b>, that is, when the back door <b>3</b> is still at a position below the neutral position “C”, the operation flow goes to step S<b>13</b>.</p>
    <p>At this step S<b>13</b>, judgement is carried out as to whether the upward pivoting of the back door <b>3</b> is under acceleration or not. If YES, that is, when the upward pivoting of the back door <b>3</b> is under acceleration, the operation flow goes back to START. The YES judgement at step S<b>13</b> is actually provided in a condition wherein the back door <b>3</b> is being pivoted upward manually by the operator. If, under this condition, the manual upward pivoting of the door <b>3</b> starts to be assisted by the power of the operating device <b>8</b> (or <b>28</b>), a certain shock would be applied to the operator. Thus, if the upward pivoting of the door <b>3</b> is under acceleration, the auto-driving for the door <b>3</b> by the operating device <b>8</b> (or <b>28</b>) is not induced. In other words, the auto-driving for the door <b>3</b> takes place only when the upward pivoting of the door <b>3</b> shows no acceleration, that is, in a condition wherein the operator is forced to temporarily remove his or her door moving force at the time when the door <b>3</b> comes up to a position near the neutral position “C”. That is, at such time, the operator is forced to change the door gripping manner in which his or her hand grasps the lower end of the back door <b>3</b>. When the auto-driving the operating device <b>8</b> (or <b>28</b>) is commenced at such time, no shock is applied to the operator. For achieving this advantage, the step S<b>13</b> is provided.</p>
    <p>If NO at step S<b>13</b>, that is, when the upward pivoting of the back door <b>3</b> is not under acceleration, the operation flow goes to step S<b>14</b>.</p>
    <p>At this step S<b>14</b>, judgement is carried out as to whether the moving speed of the back door <b>3</b> is within a given range or not. If YES, that is, when the door moving speed is within the given range, the operation flow goes to step S<b>15</b>. The YES judgement is actually provided in a condition wherein the moving speed is lower than a higher given speed that does not provide the operator with a marked shock upon switching to the auto-driving and higher than a lower given speed that is provided by the manual handling of the door <b>3</b> by the operator.</p>
    <p>If NO at step S<b>14</b>, that is, when the moving speed of the back door <b>3</b> is not within the given range, the operation flow goes back to START.</p>
    <p>At step S<b>15</b>, the electric motor <b>10</b> is energized and then at step S<b>16</b>, the electromagnetic clutch <b>11</b> <i>c </i>is engaged. Thus, the pivoting of the back door <b>3</b> toward the full-open position “A” is carried out by the force produced by the operating device <b>8</b> (or <b>28</b>). The moving speed of the back door <b>3</b> at this time is set higher than the higher given speed provided at the step S<b>14</b>, so that the switching from the manual handling to the auto-driving produces substantially no shock.</p>
    <p>After the step S<b>16</b>, the operation flow goes to step S<b>17</b>. At this step S<b>17</b>, judgment is carried out as to whether or not the back door <b>3</b> has comes up to a given position at which braking of the upward pivoting of the door <b>3</b> should start. If NO, that is, when the back door <b>3</b> has not come to the given position yet, the operation flow goes back to the front of the step S<b>17</b>, and the judgment work is repeated until the back door <b>3</b> comes to the given position.</p>
    <p>If YES at step S<b>17</b>, that is, when the back door <b>3</b> has come up to the given position, the operation flow goes to step S<b>18</b> to brake the upward movement of the back door <b>3</b>. Actually, the rotation of the motor <b>10</b> is braked. With this, the upward movement of the door is decelerated. Then, the operation flow goes to step S<b>19</b>.</p>
    <p>At step S<b>19</b>, judgment is carried out as to whether the back door <b>3</b> has come up to the full-open position “A” or not. If NO, that is, when the back door <b>3</b> has not come to the fully-open position “A” yet, the operation flow goes back to the front of the step S<b>19</b> and the judgement work is repeated until the back door <b>3</b> comes to the full-open position “A”.</p>
    <p>If YES at step S<b>19</b>, that is, when the back door <b>3</b> has come to the full-open position “A”, the operation flow goes to step S<b>20</b> to disengage the electromagnetic clutch <b>11</b> <i>c </i>and then to step S<b>21</b> to deenergize the motor <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>With the above-mentioned steps, the back door <b>3</b> is finally pivoted to the full-open position “A”.</p>
