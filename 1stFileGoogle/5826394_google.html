Each face preferably has a wall with a particular thickness. An opening is provided in at least a particular one of the faces, and preferably in all six (6) faces. A hollow beam (e.g. a rectangular prism) preferably has six (6) perpendicular faces. Each face is preferably defined by a wall with a particular thickness. An opening is provided in at least a particular one of the faces, and preferably in the four (4) faces defining a closed loop, in the beam. Substantially parallel snaps extend from the other two (2) beam walls and have at their outer ends portions shaped to facilitate insertion of such snaps into the opening in the particular face of the block, retention of the snaps by the inner surface of the face defining the opening and removal of the snaps from the opening. Such portions are shaped for the beams to be pulled, peeled or bent from the block. When the block has an opening in each of its six (6) faces, snaps from six (6) different beams can extend into the six (6) different openings in six (6) different directions in the block without any interference in the block from the snaps in the six (6) beams. In this way, complex structures can be formed from the blocks and the beams. Other structures such as vehicle ramps, building roofs, awnings and corbels can be disposed in a cooperative relationship with a structure formed from the blocks and the beams.</div>

    <p>This invention relates to building blocks and building beams forming a basic structure for forming complex edifices. The invention particularly relates to building blocks and building beams which can be assembled easily by children in toy systems to form complex structures.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>A considerable number of toy systems are now being marketed for use by children to build complex structures. The systems employ building blocks which are assembled by the children to form the structures. The building blocks in such toy systems have a number of significant disadvantages. They are expensive, not capable of being easily manipulated by the children using such blocks and relatively complicated. For example, such systems often require a number of different types of blocks to form a proper structure of any creativity. This is particularly true when the structure is extended in a number of different directions.</p>
    <p>The building blocks of the prior art are also disadvantageous in that they have odd shapes. This prevents the building blocks from having a uniform disposition on a support surface such as a table or a floor and complicates the ability of children to form creative structures from the blocks. It also complicates the ability of the children to stack the blocks compactly in an enclosure such as a box when the blocks are not being used.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>This invention provides a system which overcomes the disadvantages of the systems of the prior art. For example, the system of this invention provides a single type of coupling block and a single type of beam to form complex structures involving some creativity. Furthermore, a single coupling block can operate in conjunction with a number of beams, all of the same construction, to extend the structure in six different directions along three perpendicular axes. The coupling block and the beam can be easily coupled to each other and also can be easily separated from each other. However, when the coupling block and the beam are coupled to each other, a strong and effective interrelationship exists between them.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of the invention, a hollow block (e.g. rectangular prism) preferably has six (6) perpendicular faces. Each face preferably has a wall with a particular thickness. An opening is provided in at least a particular one of the faces, and preferably in all six (6) faces. A hollow beam (e.g. a rectangular prism) preferably has six (6) perpendicular faces. Each face is defined by a wall with a particular thickness.</p>
    <p>An opening is provided in at least a particular one of the faces, and preferably in the four (4) faces defining a closed loop, in the beam. Substantially parallel snaps extend from the other two (2) beam walls and have at their outer ends portions (which may be considered as "detents") shaped to facilitate insertion of such snaps into the opening in the particular face of the block, retention of the snaps by the inner surface of the face defining the opening and removal of the snaps from the opening. Such portions are shaped for the beams to be pulled, peeled or bent from the block.</p>
    <p>When the block has an opening in each of its six (6) faces, snaps from six (6) different beams can extend into the six (6) different openings in six (6) different directions in the block without any interference in the block from the snaps in the six (6) beams. In this way, complex structures can be formed from the blocks and the beams. Other structures such as vehicle ramps, building roofs, awnings and corbels can be disposed in cooperative relationship with structure formed from the blocks and the beams.</p>
    <p>Since the block and the beam have the shapes of rectangular prisms, they have a uniform disposition on a support surface such as a floor or a table. Furthermore, since the block preferably has six (6) faces all of substantially identical construction, children can easily assemble the snaps at either of the opposite ends of the beam into the opening in any one of the faces in the block without affecting the relationship between the block and the beam when other beams are attached to other faces of the block.</p>
    <p>The blocks and the beams also have other advantages. Only blocks and beams are required to construct complex structures. This is in contrast to the prior art where a number of different types of members are required to construct complex structures. Furthermore, the blocks in the system of this invention constitute female members. This provides for a universality in the use of the blocks. When the blocks have openings in all six (6) of their faces, any of the faces can be coupled to one of the beams. This enhances the universality in the usage of the system in constructing creative structures of some complexity.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>In one embodiment of the invention, a hollow block generally indicated at 10 (FIGS. 1 and 2) is provided. The block 10 may be made from a suitable thermoplastic material such as an acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS). The block may preferably be in the form of a rectangular prism with six (6) substantially identical faces 12. Each of the faces 12 may have a configuration of a square with a suitable length such as approximately twenty millimeters (20 mm) for each side of the square, a thickness of approximately two millimeters (2 mm) and a centrally disposed square opening 14 of approximately twelve millimeters (12 mm) for each side of the opening.</p>
    <p>Openings 14 are preferably provided in each of the faces 12. It will be appreciated, however, that the opening 14 may be provided in any number of the faces from one (1) to six (6). A number of the blocks 10 may be provided with the openings 14 in only a limited number of the faces 12. Of course, limiting the number of the faces 12 with the openings 14 in the blocks 10 limits the utility which can be provided for the blocks. Grooves 16 may be provided in the faces 12 for decorative purposes.</p>
    <p>The blocks 10 may be formed in two sections respectively designated as 10a and 10b. The sections 10a and 10b may be identical although this is not a requirement. Each of the sections 10a and 10b may be provided with pegs 18 at a pair of diagonally opposite ends of such section. Each of the sections 10a and 10b may also be provided with sockets 20 at the other pair of the diagonally opposite ends of such section. The pegs 18 on each of the sections 10a and 10b are adapted to fit snugly in the sockets 20 in the other one of the sections 10a and 10b. The sections 10a and 10b may then be joined to each other as by brazing or locally heating the pegs 18 and 20 to a temperature for melting and fusing the pegs and the sockets or they may be joined by any other method well known in the art. Alternatively, the pegs 18 may be provided in the section 10a and the sockets 20 may be provided in the other section 10b.</p>
    <p>A beam generally indicated at 22 (FIGS. 3 and 4) is adapted to be used in conjunction with the block 10. The beam 22 may be made from a suitable thermoplastic material such as an acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS). The beam may preferably be in the form of a rectangular prism with four (4) substantially identical faces 24 defining a rectangle in section and with two substantially identical end faces 26 in opposed relationship at the opposite ends of the faces 24.</p>
    <p>The beam 22 may also be formed in two sections 22a and 22b in a manner similar to the formation of the block 10. For example, each of the beam sections 22a and 22b may be provided with diametrically disposed pegs 23 for each of the sections 22a and 22b and with a pair of diametrically disposed sockets 25 for receiving the pegs 23 in the other one of the beam sections 22a and 22b. After the pegs 23 in each of the sections 22a and 22b have been press fitted into the sockets 25 in the other one of the sections 22a and 22b, the two sections may be attached to each other as by brazing or by heating the pegs 23 and the sockets 25 to melt and fuse the pegs and the sockets or by any other suitable method well known in the prior art. Alternatively, the pegs 23 may be provided in the beam section 22a and the sockets 25 may be provided in the beam section 22b.</p>
    <p>Each of the faces 24 may have a plurality of face sections 24a, 24b, etc. and a plurality of openings 28a, 28b, etc., respectively corresponding to the openings 14 in the faces 12 of the block 10. Each of the openings 28a, 28b, etc. is respectively provided in one of the face sections 24a, 24b, etc. Each of the openings 28a, 28b, etc. in the beam 22 may be substantially identical to the openings 14 in the block 10. Although seven (7) openings are shown in each of the faces 24, the number of openings in each face 24 may be different from seven (7) without departing from the scope of the invention. Furthermore, the openings 28 do not have to be provided in every face. For example, the openings 28 may be provided in only one (1) of the faces 24 without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
    <p>Snaps generally indicated at 30 are preferably provided in the two (2) end faces 26. Preferably two (2) snaps 30 extend from each of the end faces 26. The snaps 30 on each of the end faces 26 are substantially identical and are substantially parallel to each other. Each of the snaps 30 has at its outer end a portion which may be considered as a detent 32 (FIGS. 5 and 6). Each detent 32 has a first portion 34 which progressively increases in thickness with progressive distances from the end faces 26. Each of the detents 32 has a second portion 36 which progressively decreases in thickness with progressive distances from the end faces 26. The first detent portion 34 and the second detent portion 36 have a common boundary 38 at the positions of their maximum thicknesses. As will be seen, the detent portions 32 and 34 of each snap 30 have a bulbous shape.</p>
    <p>The snaps 30 are constructed to be inserted into the openings 14 in the block 10. The progressive increase in thickness of the detent portion 36 facilitates this insertion. When the snaps 30 have been inserted into one of the openings 14, the detent portions 34 and 36 are disposed internally of the internal surface of the face 12 defining such opening. The snaps 30 may also be removed easily from the opening 14 in the face 12 by pulling the snaps outwardly from the opening. This is indicated by an arrow 37 in FIG. 7. The progressive increase in the thickness of the detent portions 34 in the snaps 30 facilitates the removal of the snaps from the opening 14.</p>
    <p>At the positions of the detent portions 34 and 36 in each snap 30, the snap is provided with a rounded surface 39 at the opposite ends of the snap. The rounded surface 39 on each snap 30 provides for the removal of each snap from the opening 14 in the face 12 of the block 10 by bending the snap from the opening. This may be seen from FIG. 9 where the snaps 30 on one of the beams 22 have been partially bent out of the opening 14. The direction of such bending is indicated by an arrow 41 in FIG. 9. As will be appreciated, the detent portions 34 also facilitate the bending action to remove the snaps 30 from the opening 14. This bending is indicated by an arrow 43 in FIG. 8. This bending is in a direction perpendicular to the bending shown in FIG. 9. This may be seen from FIG. 8 which shows the snap 30 partially removed from the opening 14 in the block 10 as a result of the bending of the beam 22 in the direction 43.</p>
    <p>It should be appreciated that the beam 22 does not have to be coupled to one of the openings 14 in the block 10. The beam 22 can also be coupled to one of the openings 28 in another one of the beams 22. However, the coupling of two (2) beams can occur in only one of four (4) different directions because the snaps 30 are disposed on the beams in the other two (2) directions. However, the coupling of one of the beams 22 and one of the blocks 10 can occur in any of six (6) different directions. It will thus be seen that a coupling of one of the beams 22 to one of the blocks 10 is preferable to a coupling of two (2) beams.</p>
    <p>FIG. 10 shows a miniramp generally indicated at 50. As will be seen, the miniramp 50 has an inclined surface 52 and has a pair of snaps 54 near one lateral end of the miniramp 50 and has a pair of snaps 56 near the other lateral end of the miniramp. The snaps 54 and 56 correspond in construction to the snaps 30. The snaps in each pair have the same spacing as the snaps 30 on one of the end faces 26 in the beam 22.</p>
    <p>An opening 58 corresponding in construction and dimensions to the opening 14 in the block 10 is provided between the snaps 54 and the adjacent lateral extremity of the miniramp 50. In like manner, an opening 60 is provided between the snaps 54 and 56 but adjacent to the snaps 56. Two of the miniramps 50 can be illustratively coupled to each other to form a roof by disposing the snaps 54 in a first one of the miniramps in the opening 60 in the other miniramp and by disposing the snaps 56 in the other miniramp in the opening 58 in the first one of the miniramps.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 12, the miniramp 50 may be coupled to a structure, generally indicated at 52, formed from a plurality of the blocks 10 and a plurality of the beams 22 so as to define a ramp 70 leading into the structure. When children are engaged in creative play, vehicles may be moved along the ramp 54 by the children into and out of the structure. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 12, two (2) miniramps 50 may be used as roof overhangs 62 for the structure 52 in addition to the use of an additional one of the miniramps as the ramp 70. The snaps 30 from one of the beams 22 may be inserted into the miniramp 50 when the miniramp is used as the roof overhang 62.</p>
    <p>The structure 52 shown in FIG. 12 includes a plurality of corbels. One of the corbels is shown in FIG. 11 and is generally indicated at 72. Each of the corbels 72 is disposed to provide support to the structure 52 in FIG. 12. Each of the corbels 72 includes a pair of snaps 74 having the same construction and disposition relative to each other as the snaps 30 in the beam 22. As will be seen, the snaps 74 are disposed in one of the openings 28 in one of the blocks 10.</p>
    <p>The blocks 10 and the beams 22 have certain important advantages when used in a co-operative relationship. The blocks 10 preferably have six (6) identical faces 12 and preferably have identical openings 14 in the different faces. Because of this, all of the faces 12 in the block 10 are female. The beams 22 can be considered as being partially female and partially male. The male members in the beam 22 constitute the snaps 30.</p>
    <p>The snaps 30 can be disposed in any of the openings 14 in the blocks 12 without interfering with the snaps in any of the other openings in such blocks. When the snaps 30 from different ones of the beams 22 are in all of the six (6) openings 14 in the block 10, the beams 22 including the snaps extend outwardly from the block 10 in six (6) different directions. This provides for the extension of the structure, such as the structure 52, in six (6) different directions. The snaps 30 in the beams 22 can also be disposed in the openings 28 in others of the beams 22.</p>
    <p>When the snaps 30 in one of the beams 22 have been inserted into the opening 14 in the block 10, they can be removed from the openings by pulling (FIG. 7) the snaps out of the openings or by bending (FIGS. 8 and 9) the snaps from the openings in either of two (2) different rotary directions displaced by 90° from each other. This provides for a relatively simple coupling and decoupling of the blocks 10 and the beams 22.</p>
    <p>The blocks 10 and the beams 22 have a uniform disposition on a support surface such as a table or a floor. This simplifies the ability of children to form creative structures from the blocks 10 and the beams. It also facilitates the ability to stack the blocks 10 and the beams 22 compactly in an enclosure such as a box when the blocks and the beams are not being used.</p>
    <p>Although this invention has been disclosed and illustrated with reference to particular embodiments, the principles involved are susceptible for use in numerous other embodiments which will be apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art. The invention is, therefore, to be limited only as indicated by the scope of the appended claims.</p>
