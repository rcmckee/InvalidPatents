    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Power operated fastener driving devices are in widespread use in the construction and building trades and typically include a power operated driving mechanism mounted within a housing that powers the driving movement of a drive element slidably mounted within a drive track that extends through a nose piece mounted to the housing. Typically when the driving mechanism is actuated, the drive element moves in a fastener driving direction through a drive stroke and then moves in the opposite direction through a return stroke during one cycle of operation. A trigger mechanism that is movable through an actuation stroke is commonly provided on the exterior of the housing to initiate an operating cycle.</p>
    <p>A magazine assembly mounted to the housing supplies a series of fasteners to the drive track through a lateral opening in the same and the leading fastener in the drive track is driven outwardly of the drive track into a workpiece by the driving movement of the drive element when the driving mechanism is actuated. Typically a spring biased fastener feeding device advances the fasteners through the magazine toward and into the drive track.</p>
    <p>Power operated fastener driving devices typically include a trip assembly mounted on the nosepiece and operatively associated with the trigger mechanism to prevent the driving mechanism from being actuated when the nosepiece is not in contact with a workpiece.</p>
    <p>Often the trip assemblies of fastener driving devices include adjustable mechanisms that can be adjusted manually to control the depth to which a fastener is driven into the workpiece. A safety trip assembly including a manual adjustment mechanism is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,209,770.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 12, a workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b>A of the safety trip assembly <b>60</b>A according to the prior art has a distal end <b>78</b>A, a proximal end <b>88</b>A, and a fixed locking structure <b>70</b>A between the ends <b>78</b>A and <b>88</b>A. A movable locking member <b>74</b>A releasably engages the fixed locking structure <b>70</b>A to retain the workpiece engaging portion at a desired position of extension. A retaining projection <b>89</b>A is integrally cast on the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b>A near the distal end <b>88</b>A. The retaining projection <b>89</b>A engages the movable locking member <b>74</b>A at a fully extended position of the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b>A to define a maximum longitudinal length of the safety trip assembly <b>60</b>A (as defined by the position of the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b>A). The safety trip assembly <b>60</b>A is biased toward and into an extended position by a spring <b>101</b>A. The retaining projection <b>89</b>A prevents removal of the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b>A from the safety trip assembly <b>60</b>A. The retaining projection <b>89</b>A also prevents the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b>A from falling or dropping out of the safety trip assembly if the movable locking member <b>74</b>A is depressed so that it is released from locking engagement relation with the fixed locking structure <b>70</b>A and held in such relation while the fastener driving tool is in a position with the nosepiece assembly facing down. As a result, heretofore the movable workpiece engaging portion of the prior art discussed above is a permanent part of the safety trip assembly.</p>
    <p>While the prior art described above has worked extremely well for its intended use, more recently a need has developed for a more flexible and modular tool.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention provides a safety trip assembly that includes a workpiece engaging portion that can be moved in the longitudinal direction of the safety trip assembly to adjust the longitudinal length of the safety trip assembly and also to remove the workpiece engaging portion from the safety trip assembly for exchanging the workpiece engaging portion with another workpiece engaging member.</p>
    <p>According to one aspect of the invention, a fastener driving tool for driving fasteners into a workpiece includes a housing assembly including a nosepiece assembly defining a longitudinally-extending fastener drive track. A fastener driving mechanism is carried internally of the housing assembly and constructed and arranged to drive a fastener through the fastener drive track and into a workpiece when the fastener drive mechanism is selectively activated by a user. A manually actuatable trigger mechanism is constructed and arranged to activate the fastener driving mechanism when manually actuated by a user.</p>
    <p>A safety trip assembly includes a trigger enabling portion and a workpiece engaging portion slidably mounted to the trigger enabling portion for rectilinear sliding movement in a longitudinal direction relative to the trigger enabling portion. A manually operable locking mechanism includes a manually-operable, movable locking member mounted to the trigger enabling portion for movement between a locking position and a releasing position, the movable locking member in the locking position thereof engaging the workpiece engaging portion to releasably couple the workpiece engaging portion to the trigger enabling portion and thereby fix a longitudinal length of the safety trip assembly, the movable locking member in the releasing position thereof being disengaged from the workpiece engaging portion to enable the workpiece engaging portion to be slid rectilinearly in the longitudinal direction relative to the trigger enabling portion for adjusting the longitudinal length of the safety trip assembly and for removing the workpiece engaging portion from the safety trip assembly.</p>
    <p>A spring biases the movable locking member into the locking position, the spring permitting the movable locking member to be manually moved to the releasing position against the biasing force by a user's hand engaging the movable locking member to move the movable locking member from the locking position to the releasing position and to automatically return to the locking position when the movable locking member is disengaged by the user's hand.</p>
    <p>According to another aspect of the invention, the workpiece engaging portion is removable from the safety trip assembly. A workpiece engaging portion according to this aspect of the invention includes a positioning mechanism having an opening locating structure and a guiding structure. The opening locating structure is movably connected to the safety trip assembly and is adapted to extend into the opening to align the nosepiece assembly with respect to the opening. The opening locating structure is movable relative to the safety trip assembly between an extended position by a first biasing spring to facilitate locating of the opening, and movable to a retracted position when the opening locating structure is pressed against the workpiece. The guiding structure is movably connected to the nosepiece assembly and is biased by a second spring to extend forwardly to guide the fastener in the drive track.</p>
    <p>In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a method is provided for exchanging different workpiece engaging portions of a safety trip assembly in a fastener driving tool for driving fasteners into a workpiece, the safety trip assembly including a trigger enabling portion and a workpiece engaging portion, the workpiece engaging portion slidably mounted to the trigger enabling portion for movement in a longitudinal direction relative to the trigger enabling portion, the safety trip assembly being movable when the workpiece engaging portion is releasably coupled to the trigger enabling portion between an extended position and a retracted position whereby the trigger enabling portion enables the trigger mechanism to activate the fastener driving mechanism when manually actuated by a user when the safety trip assembly is in the retracted position and disables the trigger mechanism when the safety trip assembly is not in the retracted position.</p>
    <p>The method includes manually engaging and moving a manually-operable, movable locking member mounted to the trigger enabling portion against a biasing of a spring from a locking position wherein the locking member lockingly engages a first workpiece engaging portion to releasably couple the first workpiece engaging portion to the trigger enabling portion to a releasing position wherein the locking member is disengaged from the first workpiece engaging portion. While the locking member is in the releasing position thereof, the first workpiece engaging portion is moved relative to the trigger enabling portion until the first workpiece engaging portion is removed from the safety trip assembly, and a second workpiece engaging portion different from the first workpiece engaging portion is moved relative to the trigger enabling portion so that the second workpiece engaging portion is mounted to the trigger enabling portion. The locking member is manually released to allow the spring to bias the movable locking member from the releasing position back into the locking position to thereby lockingly engage the second workpiece engaging portion.</p>
    <p>Other aspects of the invention will be appreciated from the following description and appended claims.</p>

The actuating valve <b>36</b> is actuated by a trigger mechanism <b>37</b>. The structure and operation of the trigger mechanism <b>37</b> is described in detail in the '842 patent. The structure and operation of the trigger mechanism is discussed below in relation to the operation of the present invention.</p>
    <p>Means are provided within the housing structure <b>16</b> to affect the return stroke of the piston <b>30</b>. For example, such means may be in the form of a conventional plenum chamber return system such as that disclosed in the 096 patent.</p>
    <p>A fastener driving element <b>38</b> is suitably connected to the piston <b>30</b> and is slidably mounted within the fastener driving track <b>28</b> formed in the nosepiece assembly <b>18</b>. The fastener magazine assembly <b>14</b> is operable to receive a supply of fasteners <b>40</b> at a first end (not shown) and to feed the leading fastener out a second end <b>44</b> thereof through a lateral opening <b>46</b> (best seen in the cross-section of FIG. 2) in the nosepiece assembly <b>18</b> into the fastener driving track <b>28</b> to be driven therefrom by the fastener driving element <b>38</b> in a conventional manner.</p>
    <p>The manner in which the fasteners <b>40</b> are supplied to the drive track <b>28</b> is conventional and is best appreciated from the cross-sectional view of FIG. <b>2</b> and the structure of the fastener magazine assembly <b>14</b> is best appreciated from the cross-sectional view of the same shown in FIG. <b>3</b>.</p>
    <p>The fastener magazine assembly <b>14</b> includes an inner portion <b>48</b> that defines a fastener supply channel <b>50</b> that is in communication with the lateral opening <b>46</b>. The fastener magazine assembly <b>14</b> is constructed and arranged to hold a supply of fasteners <b>40</b> within the fastener supply channel <b>50</b> in an operative orientation for feeding the fasteners <b>40</b> from the fastener supply channel <b>50</b> through the lateral opening <b>46</b> and into the fastener driving track <b>28</b>. A fastener feeding mechanism <b>52</b> is provided as part of the fastener magazine assembly <b>14</b>. The fastener feeding mechanism <b>52</b> is spring biased in a conventional manner to move toward the second end of the magazine assembly so that when the mechanism <b>52</b> is positioned behind a supply of fasteners <b>40</b> disposed within the supply channel <b>50</b> the fastener feeding mechanism <b>52</b> biasingly engages the same to urge the fasteners <b>40</b> toward and into the fastener driving track <b>28</b> in a well known manner.</p>
    <p>The present invention is not primarily concerned with the structure and operation of the fastener driving mechanism <b>26</b>, with the structure of the housing assembly <b>12</b> or with the structure of the nosepiece assembly <b>18</b>, all of which may be conventional. The focus of the present invention is, rather, the structure and operation of a safety trip assembly that acts as a safety to prevent the fastener driving mechanism <b>26</b> from being actuated until the nosepiece assembly <b>18</b> is pressed against a workpiece and the manner in which the safety trip assembly functions to control the depth to which a fastener is driven into the workpiece.</p>
    <p>The structure of the safety trip assembly <b>60</b> is best appreciated from FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>4</b>-<b>7</b>. The safety trip assembly <b>60</b> includes a trigger enabling portion <b>62</b> and a workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b> that is releasably coupled to the trigger enabling portion <b>62</b> by a releasable coupling mechanism <b>66</b>. The safety trip assembly <b>60</b> is coupled to the housing assembly <b>12</b> for longitudinal movement with respect to the nosepiece assembly <b>18</b> between an extended position and a retracted position. When the safety trip assembly <b>60</b> is in the retracted position, the trigger enabling portion <b>62</b> conditions the trigger mechanism <b>37</b> and places it in an active state or condition so that manual movement of the trigger mechanism <b>37</b> thereafter through its actuation stroke will actuate the fastener driving mechanism <b>26</b>. When the safety trip assembly <b>60</b> is in the extended position, the trigger enabling portion <b>62</b> disables the trigger mechanism <b>37</b> to prevent the fastener driving tool <b>10</b> from being accidentally actuated if the trigger mechanism is moved through its actuation stroke.</p>
    <p>The releasable coupling mechanism <b>66</b> allows the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b> to be uncoupled from the trigger enabling portion <b>62</b> to permit adjustment of the longitudinal length of safety trip assembly <b>60</b>. The releasable coupling mechanism <b>66</b> includes a manually operable locking mechanism <b>68</b> that is carried by the trigger enabling portion and a fixed locking structure <b>70</b> that is formed on the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b> of the safety trip assembly <b>60</b>.</p>
    <p>The manually operable locking mechanism <b>68</b> includes a locking member mounting structure <b>72</b> that is rigidly attached to the trigger enabling portion <b>62</b> and a manually-operable, movable locking member <b>74</b> movably mounted in the locking member mounting structure <b>72</b> for movement with respect thereto between a locking position and a releasing position. The locking member mounting structure <b>72</b> is positioned adjacent the fixed locking structure <b>70</b> on the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b> so that when the movable locking member <b>74</b> is in its locking position, it engages the fixed locking structure <b>70</b> so that the movable locking member <b>74</b> and the fixed locking structure <b>70</b> are interlocked to prevent relative movement between the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b> and the trigger enabling portion <b>62</b>. When the movable locking member <b>74</b> is moved to its releasing position, the locking member <b>74</b> disengages from and releases the fixed locking structure <b>70</b> to permit relative movement between the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b> and the trigger enabling portion <b>62</b> of the safety trip assembly <b>60</b>. As will become apparent, the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b> can be selectively repositioned with respect to the trigger enabling portion <b>62</b> of the safety trip assembly <b>60</b> to vary the depth to which a fastener is driven.</p>
    <p>The manner in which the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b> and the trigger enabling portion <b>62</b> of the safety trip assembly <b>60</b> are mounted on the nosepiece assembly <b>18</b> and the manner in which the movable locking member <b>74</b> is releasably engaged with the fixed locking structure <b>70</b> on the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b> can best be appreciated from FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>6</b>-<b>8</b>.</p>
    <p>The workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b> and the trigger enabling portion <b>62</b> of the safety trip assembly <b>60</b> are each integral structures preferably made of steel or other metal of suitable strength. As shown in FIG. 6, rearwardly extending wall structures <b>76</b> integrally formed on a distal end <b>78</b> of the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b> partially surround a distal end portion <b>80</b> of the nosepiece assembly <b>18</b> to movably mount the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b> of the safety trip assembly <b>60</b> on the nosepiece assembly <b>18</b> to allow longitudinal movement of the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b> with respect to the nosepiece assembly <b>18</b> of the housing assembly <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p>The locking member mounting structure <b>72</b> is an integral structure preferably made of steel, although other metals of suitable strength could also be used in the construction. A proximal end <b>82</b> of the trigger enabling portion <b>62</b> is rigidly attached to the locking member mounting structure <b>72</b> and the locking member mounting structure <b>72</b> is in turn movably coupled to the nosepiece assembly <b>18</b> for limited movement in the longitudinal direction of the locking member mounting structure <b>72</b> with respect to the nosepiece assembly <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p>The manner in which the locking member mounting structure <b>72</b> is coupled to the nosepiece assembly <b>18</b> can be appreciated from FIGS. 7 and 8. More specifically, integral bracket structures <b>84</b> on the locking member mounting structure <b>72</b> are engaged with integral, longitudinally extending wall portions <b>86</b> formed on a central portion of the nosepiece assembly <b>18</b>. A proximal end <b>88</b> of the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b> extends between the locking member mounting structure <b>72</b> and the nosepiece assembly <b>18</b> in a position to engage the movable locking member <b>74</b>.</p>
    <p>The movable locking member <b>74</b> is an integral structure preferably made of steel, although a high strength molded plastic or other material of suitable strength could also be used in the construction. As best appreciated from FIGS. 2 and 7, the movable locking member <b>74</b> is provided with a series of continuous transversely extending teeth <b>90</b> and grooves <b>92</b> provided on angled, longitudinally extending wall portions <b>93</b>, <b>95</b>, respectively, of the locking member <b>74</b> that engage similarly constructed integral transversely extending teeth <b>94</b> and grooves <b>96</b> formed on an angled, longitudinally extending wall structure <b>98</b> of the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b>. It can be appreciated that in the exemplary embodiment of the fastener driving tool <b>10</b> shown in the figures, the teeth and grooves <b>94</b>, <b>96</b> on the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b> of the safety trip assembly <b>60</b> constitute the fixed locking structure <b>70</b> thereof.</p>
    <p>The teeth and grooves <b>90</b>, <b>92</b> on the movable locking member <b>74</b> are normally biased into releasable locking engagement with the teeth and grooves <b>94</b>, <b>96</b> on the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b> by a locking member biasing mechanism <b>100</b> which can be a conventional coil spring as shown in FIGS. 7 and 8. The locking member biasing mechanism <b>100</b> biases the movable locking member <b>74</b> toward and into its locking position to prevent relative movement between the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b> and the trigger enabling portion <b>62</b> of the safety trip assembly <b>60</b>. The movable locking member <b>74</b> and the locking member biasing mechanism <b>100</b> are constructed and arranged to permit the user to move the movable locking member <b>74</b> manually against the biasing force of the locking member biasing mechanism <b>100</b> from the locking position to the releasing position and to allow the movable locking member <b>74</b> to return to its locking position under the biasing force when the user releases the movable locking member. As will become apparent, when the movable locking member <b>74</b> is in its releasing position, the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b> can be moved longitudinally with respect to the trigger enabling portion <b>62</b> to adjust fastener drive depth.</p>
    <p>The safety trip assembly <b>60</b> is normally biased toward and into its extended position by a conventional coil spring <b>101</b> that is mounted between the nosepiece assembly <b>18</b> and the locking member mounting structure <b>72</b> of the releasable coupling mechanism <b>66</b>.</p>
    <p>The releasable coupling mechanism <b>66</b> of the safety trip assembly <b>60</b> can be manually adjusted simply and easily without the use of hand tools to control the depth to which the fastener driving device <b>10</b> drives a fastener into a workpiece by moving the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b> of the safety trip assembly <b>60</b> relative to the trigger enabling portion <b>62</b> thereof. To adjust the safety trip assembly <b>60</b>, the user (with the fastener driving tool <b>10</b> preferably disconnected from a source of pressurized air to assure user safety) presses an end portion <b>126</b> of the movable locking member <b>74</b> with a thumb or finger to move the member <b>74</b> from its locking position to its releasing position. While manually holding the movable locking member <b>74</b> in its releasing position, the user moves the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b> of the safety trip assembly <b>60</b> toward or away from the trigger enabling portion <b>62</b> thereof. When the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b> is in the desired position relative to the trigger enabling portion <b>62</b>, the user releases the movable locking member <b>74</b> and allows the locking member biasing mechanism <b>100</b> to automatically move the movable locking member <b>74</b> toward its locking position. It can be understood that the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b> may have to be moved slightly toward or away from the trigger enabling portion <b>62</b> to allow the transversely extending teeth <b>90</b> and grooves <b>92</b> on the movable locking member <b>74</b> to align with the transversely extending teeth <b>94</b> and grooves <b>96</b> on the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b>. It can be appreciated, therefore, that the teeth and grooves <b>90</b>, <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>96</b> cooperate to define a plurality of operative or indexed locking positions of the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b> with respect to the trigger enabling portion <b>62</b>.</p>
    <p>The workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b> may optionally be provided with a series of numbered, transversely extending measuring lines that can be aligned with suitable pointing structure on the locking member mounting structure <b>72</b> to indicate to the user the depth to which the nail will be driven with respect to the top surface of the workpiece.</p>
    <p>The operation of the device <b>10</b> to drive a nail is entirely conventional and will be known to those skilled in the art, but will be discussed briefly to help illustrate the operation of the releasable coupling mechanism <b>66</b> of the safety trip assembly <b>60</b> and the trip lock member <b>104</b>.</p>
    <p>To drive a fastener into a workpiece, the fasteners are first loaded into the fastener magazine assembly <b>14</b> in a conventional manner. More specifically, fasteners in, for example, conventional stick form are inserted in the fastener feeding channel <b>50</b> from the first end <b>42</b> of the magazine behind the fastener feeding mechanism <b>52</b>. The fastener feeding mechanism <b>52</b> is then pulled rearwardly within the magazine toward the first end <b>42</b> until it is positioned behind the supply of fasteners <b>40</b>. With reference to FIG. 3, it can be understood that the fastener feeding mechanism <b>52</b> is provided with a feeder mechanism blade <b>121</b> and that the blade <b>121</b> and leg structure <b>120</b> are integral parts of a single pivotable fastener engaging and pushing structure, generally designated <b>123</b>, that is preferably made of metal and is pivotally mounted on a body portion <b>125</b> (preferably made of plastic) of the fastener feeding mechanism <b>52</b>. The pivotable pushing and engaging structure <b>123</b> is spring biased in a conventional manner in a generally transverse direction toward a longitudinally extending wall portion <b>127</b> of the fastener magazine assembly but can be pivoted against the spring bias toward the body portion of the fastener feeding mechanism <b>52</b> to allow the fastener feeding mechanism <b>52</b> to be pulled rearwardly past a package of fasteners <b>40</b> in the magazine assembly in a conventional manner to allow the fastener feeding mechanism <b>52</b> to be positioned rearwardly of the fasteners while the magazine is being loaded.</p>
    <p>When the fastener magazine assembly <b>14</b> is loaded, a supply of fasteners is disposed within the fastener supply channel <b>50</b> and the fastener feeding mechanism <b>52</b> is positioned behind the supply of fasteners to push the same toward the fastener driving track <b>28</b>. The fastener driving tool <b>10</b> is then connected to a source of pressurized air.</p>
    <p>The user, holding the tool <b>10</b> by the handle grip portion <b>22</b> places the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b> of the safety trip assembly <b>60</b> on the workpiece at the location where the fastener is to be driven. The user pushes the housing assembly <b>12</b> toward the workpiece which causes the safety trip assembly <b>60</b> to move from its extended position against the spring bias of the coil spring <b>101</b> to its retracted position. The retracted position is realized when an edge portion <b>130</b> of the trigger enabling portion <b>62</b> contacts and is stopped against a surface <b>132</b> on the nosepiece assembly <b>18</b>. As the trigger enabling portion <b>62</b> moves into its retracted position, a free end <b>134</b> thereof moves a lever arm <b>136</b> pivotally mounted on a trigger member <b>138</b> of the trigger mechanism <b>37</b> to place the trigger mechanism <b>37</b> in an activated condition so that pivotal movement of the trigger member <b>138</b> by the user thereafter will depress a valve stem <b>141</b> on the actuating valve <b>36</b> to actuate the fastener driving mechanism <b>26</b> to drive the leading fastener.</p>
    <p>It can be appreciated that the fastener driving element <b>38</b> is normally in its raised position which allows the leading fastener in the fastener magazine assembly <b>14</b> to move through the lateral opening in the nosepiece assembly into the fastener driving track <b>28</b>. It can also be understood that prior to actuating the fastener driving element <b>38</b>, the head of the second fastener immediately adjacent the leading fastener is supported by surfaces <b>139</b> in the magazine assembly while the head of the leading fastener is unsupported within the fastener driving track <b>28</b>.</p>
    <p>The downward movement of the piston <b>30</b> through its drive stroke carries the fastener driving element <b>38</b> to its lowermost position. When the fastener driving element <b>38</b> is in its lowermost position, the distal end thereof typically extends slightly out of the drive track so the distal driving surface of the driving element <b>38</b> is positioned about one quarter inch (typically) beyond the end of the drive track <b>28</b> and this defines the point at which the fastener driving element <b>38</b> stops driving the fastener <b>40</b> toward and into the workpiece. One skilled in the art will understand that the driving element <b>38</b> extends beyond the end of the track <b>28</b> to compensate for a reaction force that occurs during actuation which tends to move the housing assembly and associated structures away from the workpiece and to provide the ability to countersink the fastener if desired. It will be understood that the distance between the end of the nosepiece assembly <b>18</b> (which defines the distal end of the drive track <b>28</b>) and the surface of the workpiece determines the depth to which a fastener is driven into the workpiece and that the position of the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b> relative to the trigger enabling portion <b>62</b> determines this distance.</p>
    <p>More specifically, the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b> can be adjusted by appropriate manipulation of the releasable coupling mechanism <b>66</b> to position the end of the drive track <b>28</b> against the workpiece when the safety trip assembly <b>60</b> is in the retracted position to drive the fastener so that is it flush (or counter sunk, depending on the nature of the material of the workpiece) or can be moved outwardly from the trigger enabling portion <b>62</b> into any one of a multiplicity of adjusted operating positions to hold the end of the drive track <b>28</b> in spaced relation to the workpiece surface to partially drive the nail into the workpiece a desired predetermined distance.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIGS. 10 and 11, an embodiment of an alternate preferred workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b>B for use with a safety trip assembly <b>60</b>B of the fastener driving tool <b>10</b> according to the present invention includes a positioning mechanism constructed and arranged to position the nosepiece assembly into an opening in a first workpiece such that the fastener is driven through the opening to fasten the first workpiece to a second workpiece. The positioning mechanism includes an opening locating structure <b>61</b> movably connected to the safety trip assembly <b>60</b>B and adapted to extend into the opening to align the nosepiece assembly with respect to the opening. The opening locating structure <b>61</b> is movable relative to the safety trip assembly <b>60</b>B between an extended position by a first biasing spring <b>63</b> to facilitate locating of the opening, and movable to a retracted position when the opening locating structure <b>61</b> is pressed against the first workpiece. The positioning mechanism further includes a guiding structure <b>65</b> movably connected to the nosepiece assembly, the guiding structure <b>65</b> being biased by a second spring <b>67</b> to extend forwardly to guide the fastener in the drive track <b>28</b>. The workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b>B of FIGS. 10 and 11 that is usable with the present invention is disclosed in more detail in commonly assigned, co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 10/244,597, filed Sep. 17, 2002, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. It should be appreciated that other workpiece engaging portions can also be employed, and the ease of removability of the workpiece engaging portion enables the same tool to be readilly adapted for different applications.</p>
    <p>It also enables quick replacement of a damaged workpiece engaging portion with a new one. As shown in FIG. 10, the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b>B does not include a retaining projection near its proximal end <b>88</b>B. The workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b>B is removable from the safety trip assembly <b>601</b> and may be exchanged with another workpiece engaging portion, such as the workpiece engaging portion <b>64</b>. The fastener driving tool <b>10</b> may then be used with different workpiece engaging portions, which increases the versatility of the fastener driving tool <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>It can be understood that the embodiments of the fastener driving tool <b>10</b> shown and described are exemplary only and not intended to limit the scope of the invention. It will be understood, for example, that the trigger mechanism <b>37</b> and the safety trip assembly <b>60</b> cooperate to actuate the actuating valve <b>36</b> and begin the drive cycle regardless of whether the safety trip assembly <b>60</b> is moved to its retracted position first and the trigger member is moved rearwardly to its actuated position thereafter or whether the trigger member is moved rearwardly to its actuated position and then the safety trip assembly <b>60</b>, <b>60</b>B is moved to its retracted position thereafter. It can be understood that it is within the scope of the present invention to provide a manual actuating mechanism that incorporates the releasable coupling mechanism <b>66</b> that requires a particular sequence of movements as, for example, an initial movement of the safety trip assembly <b>60</b>, <b>60</b>B into its operative position and then the digital movement of the trigger member to its actuated position.</p>
    <p>One skilled in the art will understand that a releasable coupling mechanism constructed according to the principles of the present invention can be incorporated into a wide range of safety trip assemblies that can be used on a wide range of power operated fastener driving devices.</p>
    <p>It can also be appreciated that the type of fastener driven by the tool <b>10</b> and the size thereof can vary widely. It is also understood that the manner in which the fasteners are releasably secured to one another is entirely conventional. The fasteners <b>40</b> shown are flathead nails that are packaged in straight stick form and may be of the type which include notched heads enabling the shanks of the nails to be disposed in a shank-to-shank abutting stick and secured thereto by a pair of wires suitably welded to one side of the shanks. It will be understood that the invention has wide applicability in power operated fastener driving devices that include straight magazines and pushers or other conventional feeding mechanisms that are movably mounted within the magazine. It will also be understood that while the present device is particularly useful in large size pneumatic fastener driving devices, the invention can be applied to devices where fastener drivers are of a lesser size. It can also be understood that the invention is not restricted to pneumatically powered devices and can be included in other power operated devices of the fluid pressure operated type including those powered by internal combustion. The driver may also be driven electromagnetically in other embodiments of the invention.</p>
