    <heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading> <p>This is a continuation-in-part of co-pending application titled “Improved Security Infusion Pump With Bar Code Reader,” Ser. No. 09/452,488, filed Dec. 1, 1999, relied upon for priority and incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention relates to an intravenous (IV) infusion pump used in a health care facility such as a hospital, the pump is designed to provide enhanced monitoring and record keeping of infusion pump operations and operational characteristics, such as settings, parameters, conditions or states, through a hospital information management system (HIMS).</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>In hospitals there is a need to accurately monitor the administration of medications to patients. Presently systems for administration of IV medications to a patient in a hospital vary from hospital to hospital in certain specific aspects. However, many basic procedures and practices are similar in a significant number of hospitals for the administration of medications. For example, the administration of medication to a patient originate with prescribed medications ordered by a doctor. The doctor's order is provided to a pharmacy where a trained pharmacist will obtain and prepare the ordered medication. In the case of medications to be administered orally (as with pills), intramuscularly (as with a needle and syringe) or intravenously (as with a mixture of medication in a diluent) the pharmacist may provide the medication for delivery to the patient's nurse with appropriate instructions for administering the medication to the patient according to the doctor's order.</p>
    <p>In the case of pills or injections, the pharmacist delivers the pills or a vile for the injection with instructions for the quantity or the amount to be administered.</p>
    <p>In the case of an IV medication, the pharmacist prepares an IV solution according to the doctor's order. Typically the resulting IV solution is prepared in a sterile bag in the form of a diluent and the active medication. Often the diluent includes glucose in water for hydrating and nourishing the patient. Other medications may also be included as may facilitate medical treatment.</p>
    <p>In the case of a blood product that requires IV administration, the doctor's order is usually be provided to a hospital lab. Where the hospital lab prepares a blood product for administration to a patient. The blood product will typically be provided in a sterile IV hanging bag.</p>
    <p>A prepared IV medication solution or blood product is labeled; identifying the patient, identifying the medication (or the blood product) and indicating the appropriate administration instructions according to the Doctor's order. The non-IV medication, the IV medication or the blood product is then delivered to the hospital floor where the patient is residing. Typically all medication goes to a nurses's station on the designated floor and the nurse assigned to the patient administers and documents the administration of the medication.</p>
    <p>In the past, monitoring each step of the process from the doctor's order to the pharmacist, to preparation of the medication, to the laboratory preparation of the blood product and to the administration to the patient was by handwritten or typed documentation. The doctor, the pharmacy, the lab and the nurse who actually administers the medication to the patient made separate entries.</p>
    <p>The record of medication administration to the patient by the nurse might be a single entry on the patient's chart at the time the medication is given. In the case of oral or intra muscular medications, this record might be sufficient. In the case of an IV medication the administering event actually occurs over an extended period of time during which numerous situations could interfere with complete administration of the medication to the patient and the single event entry may be inadequate.</p>
    <p>Modem hospitals have developed central systems using sophisticated computer equipment to help keep track of patients and to monitor the health care services provided to them. These systems including central computer monitoring are sometimes known as Hospital Information Management Systems (HIMS). Typically a patient is given a unique patient identification number when admitted to the hospital. This number is placed on the patient's chart and often on a patient ID bracelet. Selected information known at the time of patient admission to the hospital, for example, information relevant to the patient, the patient's physician, the method of payment or insurance coverage, the patient's condition, initial diagnosis, intended treatment and etc. can be entered into the HIMS at the admissions desk. Other information that might become known or that subsequently becomes relevant during the hospital stay might also be entered into a properly programed HIMS. The HIMS presents possibilities for allowing beneficial information retrieval by authorized healthcare providers in the hospital, whether it be the attending physician, the ER doctors, “on call” physicians, nurses, pharmacist, lab technicians and etc. Portions of the information that is relevant to financial operations such as cost of medications, supplies and special services associated with the patient's care can also be stored and coded for the particular patient and accessed by billing clerks, insurance administrators, and account coordinators, under appropriate access codes or other procedures for maintaining patient privacy.</p>
    <p>Much of the patient information is currently typed into the computer through network computer terminals wired to the HIMS. It is difficult to keep certain types of information current, particularly specific patient care information from the patient's hospital room chart. The lag time between providing the care or medication to the patient, writing it on the chart and then entering the charted information into the HIMS at a designated network computer or a data entry terminal often entails a significant delay. Also, appropriately tracking the hospital's inventory and patient use of medications and controlled substances such as addictive drugs is not as current or as accurate as might be hoped.</p>
    <p>Modern healthcare, particularly in hospitals, clinics and other healthcare institutions, has improved and benefited significantly from the development and use of medical infusion pumps to enhance patient care. For example, parenteral infusion and, in particular, intravenous infusion directly into the patient's circulatory system, can be advantageous. Therapeutic fluids, drugs, medications, pharmacological fluids, hydrating fluids, sucrose fluids, nutrient fluids, or other therapeutic fluids can generally be infused using disposable cassette pumps and peristaltic pumps. Syringe pumps can also be used in some instances. Particularly, it is advantageous to provide different kinds of controlled infusion including rate controlled infusion, periodic infusion, and bolus dosage infusion, all depending upon the medication, the patient, the patient's condition and any of a number of other healthcare considerations.</p>
    <p>In institutional healthcare facilities, such as major hospitals, large clinics and other large medical facilities, prescribed medications are prepared in a facility pharmacy by a staff pharmacist or a team of pharmacists, according to a doctor's order. Detailed instructions for the administration of the drug may also be provided with the prescribed medication to nurses or other highly trained medical professionals according to the doctor's order and according to professional knowledge of the pharmacist with respect to pharmacological protocol for the medication, therapeutic fluids or mixtures of drugs involved. The medication is received by a nurse or a medical professional in an appropriate container prepared by the pharmacist to be delivered to the patient's room and accordingly administered to the patient. For purposes of accurate infusion, rather than merely using a timed drip-type infusion mechanism, infusion pumps are beneficially used. Based upon the prescribed medication, the protocol for administering the modern infusion therapeutic fluid may include carefully controlled infusion rates. Modem infusion pumps maybe adjustably configured by the person administering the infusion to deliver the fluid according to the doctor's and/or pharmacist's instructions.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>A wireless communication system from an IV medication infusion pump to a hospital information management system (HIMS) is disclosed. The system includes an IV pump having pump operation circuitry for monitoring preselected characteristics of pump operation indicative of IV administration of medication to a patient. A transmitter is connected to the pump operation circuitry for transmitting a wireless pump signal representing the preselected pump operation characteristics. The wireless pump transmitter communicates with a hospital information management system (HIMS). The HIMS includes a receiver capable of receiving the pump signal representing the pump operation characteristics and also includes a computer processor capable of storing and displaying the pump operation characteristics represented by the received wireless pump signal.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p>A wireless communication system <b>9</b> is shown schematically in FIG. 1, permitting wireless signal communication from an IV medication infusion pump <b>10</b> to a health care facility information center such as a hospital information management system (HIMS) <b>60</b>. The system includes at least one IV pump <b>10</b> having pump operation circuitry <b>41</b> and circuitry <b>43</b> for monitoring preselected characteristics <b>15</b> of pump operation indicative of IV administration <b>18</b> of medication to a patient <b>20</b>. A transmitter <b>45</b> is connected to the IV pump operation circuitry <b>41</b> for transmitting a wireless pump signal <b>49</b> representing the preselected pump operation characteristics <b>15</b>. Such pump operation characteristics might include any one or more of pump settings, parameters, conditions, states or changes thereof The wireless pump transmitter <b>45</b> wirelessly transmits the pump operation characteristics <b>15</b> to the HIMS <b>60</b>. The HIMS includes a receiver <b>61</b> capable of receiving the pump signal <b>49</b> representing the pump operation characteristics <b>15</b>. The HIMS may also include a computer processor <b>57</b> capable of storing and displaying at <b>63</b> the pump operation characteristics <b>15</b> represented by the received wireless pump signal <b>49</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 1 also depicts an embodiment comprising a plurality of IV pumps <b>10</b>, <b>10</b> <i>b</i>, <b>10</b> <i>c</i>, <b>10</b> <i>d</i>, and . . . <b>10</b> <i>z </i>providing IV medication infusion to a plurality of patients <b>20</b>, <b>20</b> <i>b</i>, <b>20</b> <i>c</i>, <b>20</b> <i>d</i>, and . . . <b>20</b> <i>y</i>. It will be understood from the disclosure that any number of pumps <b>10</b> may be included in the hospital system for IV infusion to any number of patients <b>20</b>. Also more than one pump may be provided for any one of the patients. Each of the wireless infusion pumps shall be identified with a unique pump ID such as an identification code, a wireless signal identifier or a digital “address.” Similarly, each patient is individually identified with a patient ID for proper security and tracking in the HIMS. Thus each of the plurality of IV pumps can wirelessly communicate with the HIMS and the information regarding the particular pump can be identified and information from the pump regarding the particular patient to whom the identified pump is infusing can be properly identified and tracked in the HIMS. The separate signals are schematically represented as wireless signals <b>49</b>, <b>49</b> <i>b</i>, <b>49</b> <i>c</i>, <b>49</b> <i>d</i>, and . . . <b>49</b> <i>z </i>from each pump to the receiver <b>61</b> of the HIMS <b>60</b>. In the embodiment depicted the wireless signal is depicted as being transmitted for a radio frequency (RF) signal from an antenna <b>47</b> <i>b </i>at the pump <b>10</b> to an RF antenna <b>63</b> at he HIMS. It will be understood from the disclosure that while an RF wireless signal is advantageously contemplated as the best mode of the invention, other wireless signals such as infrared (IR), laser beam, ultrasonic might be used according to some of the aspects of the invention.</p>
    <p>FIG. 2 shows a schematic perspective view of an infusion pump <b>10</b> according to one aspect of the present invention. In this embodiment the pumping device <b>10</b> and its various components are generally enclosed within a housing <b>11</b>. The pumping device works together with a medicinal fluid <b>17</b> to be pumped provided from a container <b>12</b> that may be a medical bottle or disposable fluid bag or other container capable of holding the required medicinal fluid and appropriately interfacing with the pumping device <b>10</b> to provide the fluid to the patient. Fluid <b>17</b> from the container <b>12</b> is provided through input tube <b>14</b> that may be appropriate plastic or medical grade PVC or silicon tubing. Although a cassette pump is depicted in FIG. 1, it will be understood that principles of wireless transmission of pumping information from an IV pump to an HIMS, according to the present invention, may similarly be applicable to a peristaltic pump or other appropriate infusion pumps or alternative modes of IV pumping. The tubing <b>14</b> carries the fluid into the pumping device through access opening <b>16</b> that may lead to a disposable pumping cassette as set forth and described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,302,093 and 5,554,013 incorporated by reference herein or alternatively, may be engaged in a peristaltic pumping mechanism such as the linear peristaltic pumping mechanism as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,660,529 and 5,888,052, also incorporated herein by reference. As the fluid <b>17</b> is actively moved through the pump <b>10</b>, it is carried through an IV tubing <b>18</b> to a patient <b>20</b>, schematically represented by arrow <b>20</b> in FIG. <b>2</b>. Control of the pumping rate, pumping volume, pumping time and safety limitations is generally addressed through a control panel <b>22</b>. The control panel <b>22</b>, in FIG. 2, is hingably connected and swings open as indicated by a broken arrow at hinge <b>24</b>. This allows the pump to accept an administration set attached by tube <b>14</b> to IV container <b>12</b>(or in the case if a peristaltic pump, openable to accept and engage the tubing <b>14</b> directly into the peristaltic pumping mechanism). The pump door hinged at <b>24</b> is released using a release lever <b>26</b>. The entire IV pumping mechanism is shown attached through a pole clamp <b>28</b> to a pump mounting pole <b>29</b>. Other modes of supporting the pump can be used. The pump is provided with power, preferably electrical power, schematically represented as an electrical plug <b>30</b>. Other types or sources of power, such as battery power may be used. For example, a battery back-up system might be appropriately included within the pump for maintaining operations and/or for maintaining stored data or transmitting an alarm condition signal, transmitting pump operational information, operational log data or other data stored at the IV pump <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>The IV pump <b>10</b> is provided with a visual display panel <b>34</b> that is conveniently and advantageously formed on the control panel <b>22</b>. This control panel <b>22</b> is provided with a visual display panel <b>34</b> to visually show selectably entered adjustable pump operational characteristics and characteristics . For example, but without limiting the nature of the display panel <b>34</b> to a particular configuration, separate displays or sectioned display areas might include infusion rate display <b>36</b>, volume to be delivered display <b>38</b> and program infusion data display <b>40</b>. Monitoring circuitry <b>41</b> is provided connected to the pump operation circuitry <b>43</b>. The monitoring circuitry <b>41</b> may provide information for the program infusion display <b>40</b> and also for wireless transmission to the HIMS <b>60</b>. The program infusion data display <b>40</b> may include capabilities for displaying entered data and for displaying current operational data, including nurse identification and/or number display <b>42</b>, a unique patient identification name and/or number display <b>44</b>, a drug name or other identification display <b>46</b>, a dosage display <b>48</b>, a rate display <b>50</b>, a running time display <b>52</b>, total volume of infusion display <b>54</b> and possibly other displays such as alarm display <b>53</b>. For example, an alarm may be displayed upon detecting air in the line or occlusion limitations or other conditions, may be beneficially displayed or otherwise signaled to the operator. The monitoring circuitry <b>41</b> also provides the entered data and the current operating data to a wireless transmitter <b>45</b> for wireless transmission to an HIMS <b>60</b> (shown schematically as a remote computer terminal including wireless receiver unit <b>61</b>, a CPU <b>57</b> and display <b>55</b> such as a CRT screen. A data input unit <b>59</b>, such as a keyboard, a mouse, or another data entry device may also be connected to the HIMS <b>60</b>.</p>
    <p>For purposes of operating the pump according to the present invention, a power switch or power button <b>56</b> is provided on the control panel <b>22</b> and also a plurality of infusion data input controls <b>58</b>, schematically represented as buttons <b>58</b>, are provided for manually entering rate, entering volume to be delivered, for accessing a menu of drugs and options, and for toggling or otherwise selecting between various menu items, as well as for entering available menu items. These menu items will typically include available drug information, rates and dosage and other pump control information in order to effectuate programing of onboard pump control software or circuitry <b>43</b>. Menu items may be selected using a toggle or other mechanism and may be appropriately entered into the pump control software or circuitry for operating the pumping mechanism.</p>
    <p>With the understanding that any of a variety of possible types of IV pumps may be used in the present invention, the inventive wireless communication system according to one embodiment can include an IV pump <b>10</b> having pump operation circuitry <b>41</b> and circuitry <b>43</b> for monitoring preselected characteristics of pump operation. It will be understood from this disclosure that the operation circuitry and the monitoring circuitry may be separate electrically connected circuitry or software or integrally formed as unitary circuitry or software. The pump operational characteristics <b>15</b> such as parameters and states selected to be monitored may be those that are specifically indicative of IV administration of medication to a patient <b>20</b>. A transmitter <b>45</b> is connected to the pump <b>10</b>, as for example through the monitoring circuitry <b>41</b>, for transmitting a wireless pump signal <b>49</b> representing the preselected pump operation characteristics . The wireless pump transmitter <b>45</b> communicates with a hospital information management system (HIMS) <b>60</b>. The HIMS <b>60</b> includes a receiver <b>61</b> capable of receiving the pump signal <b>49</b> representing the pump operation characteristics and also includes a computer processor <b>57</b> capable of storing and displaying the pump operation characteristics on a display <b>55</b> represented by the wireless pump signal <b>49</b> received as through receiver antenna <b>63</b>.</p>
    <p>In another combination of elements depicted in FIG. 2 to demonstrate an alternative embodiment, an IV medication infusion pump <b>10</b> is provided for use with a hospital information management system <b>60</b> (HIMS), having a doctor's order <b>82</b> transmitter <b>83</b> capable of manually receiving an input doctor's order <b>82</b>, as by a keyboard <b>85</b>, for patient medication to be administered with an IV pump <b>10</b>. The doctor's transmitter <b>83</b> is capable of wirelessly transmitting a wireless signal <b>87</b> representing the input doctor's order <b>82</b>. The hospital wireless communications system <b>9</b>, having the IV pump <b>10</b> with wireless transmitter <b>45</b> and a receiver <b>61</b> at the HIMS <b>60</b>, is thus expanded, according to this alternative embodiment to receive a wireless signal <b>87</b> representing the doctor's order <b>82</b> for IV medication <b>17</b> for a patient <b>20</b>. The doctor's order transmitter <b>83</b> provides a wireless signal representing the input doctor's order for patient medication that is to be administered intravenously, namely using the IV pump <b>10</b>. In one such embodiment the doctor's order signal <b>87</b> is received at receiver <b>61</b> by the HIMS <b>60</b> for storage and/or for comparison to the actual operation characteristics as represented by the signal <b>49</b> transmitted from the IV pump <b>10</b>. The storage and comparison may be carried out using an appropriate CPU <b>57</b>. The pump <b>10</b> may also be provided with wireless signal receiver <b>51</b> to receive the doctor's order wireless signal <b>87</b> directly. Alternatively, the HIMS may also be provided with a transmitter <b>65</b> to provide to the IV pump <b>10</b>, a HIMS wireless signal <b>67</b> that may include a retransmission of the doctor's order wireless signal <b>87</b>, selected portions of the instructional content of the doctor's order <b>82</b>, or other data or instructions such as instructions input at keyboard <b>59</b> or stored at CPU <b>57</b>. The receiver at the IV pump <b>10</b> is capable of receiving such data or instructions for entry into the IV pump controls <b>43</b>. At the pump data or instructions entry and pump activation will be according to appropriate safeguard, such as verification by the nurse or other health care professional responsible for the particular hospital patient. Other possible components of the system <b>9</b> might also be capable of communication with the HIMS using wireless signals.</p>
    <p>In another combination of elements demonstrating yet another alternative embodiment, a pharmacy receiver <b>88</b> may also be provided that is capable of receiving a wireless signal representing the doctor's order for medication. The wireless signals <b>87</b> may be communicated directly between the doctor transmitter <b>83</b> and a pharmacy receiver <b>88</b>, or between the doctor transmitter <b>83</b> and the IV pump <b>10</b>. The pharmacy receiver may comprise a transceiver to communicate directly with the IV pump via wireless signal <b>91</b> or with the HIMS via wireless signal <b>89</b>. The IV pump <b>10</b> may wirelessly communicate with the HIMS <b>60</b> and the HIMS <b>60</b> may wirelessly communicate with the IV pump, with the pharmacy <b>88</b>, or with the doctor's transmitter <b>83</b>. Alternatively, all of the individual components could wirelessly communicate with the HIMS <b>60</b> where the information could be re-transmitted to any of the other system components intend to receive the wireless signal representing selected information. In this alternative embodiment, the pharmacy receiver <b>88</b> includes apparatus <b>84</b>, such as a computer terminal <b>84</b>, for providing the order for patient medication in human readable form for the preparation of ordered patient medication for IV pump administration. The medication is provided by the pharmacist to a nurses' station according to the doctor's orders for proper administration to a patient receiving care from nurses who will be operating the IV pump. In this alternative embodiment and in addition to the wireless signal transmitter <b>45</b>, the IV pump <b>10</b> also has a receiver <b>51</b> for receiving the wireless signal indicating the doctor's order. The signal indicating the doctor's order to the IV pump <b>10</b> may be a direct signal <b>87</b> <i>i </i>from the doctor's order transmitter <b>83</b> or it may be a signal <b>91</b> from the pharmacy transmitter <b>88</b> or it may be a re-transmission signal <b>67</b> from the HIMS <b>60</b>. In each case where a wireless signal transmitter and receiver is provided, there maybe separate transmitters and receivers electronically inter-connected, or there may be a combination transmitter and receiver unit known as a transceiver.</p>
    <p>Referring to the schematic flow diagram of FIG. 3, further combinations of inventive features may be understood. In this schematic the IV pump <b>10</b> for administering IV medication to a patient and for pump operation data transmission to a hospital information system HIMS <b>60</b>, are depicted among other components in a flow diagram. Medication is ordered, prepared and delivered to a patient in a hospital or other institutional health care facility. The wireless communication signal <b>49</b> from the IV pump <b>10</b> to the HIMS <b>60</b> is depicted as dashed lines with the arrowhead directed toward the HIMS. The HIMS <b>60</b> might likewise communicate with the IV pump <b>10</b> along the dashed line as indicated by the arrowhead <b>67</b> pointing toward the IV pump. As will be discussed more fully below, the wireless communication between the IV pump <b>10</b> and the HIMS <b>60</b> might alternatively be in the form of a signal <b>49</b> <i>a </i>from the IV pump <b>10</b> to a nurse's hand-held communication unit <b>98</b>, and a retransmission signal <b>49</b> <i>b </i>from the hand-held unit <b>98</b> to the HIMS <b>60</b>, as depicted with dotted lines in FIG. <b>3</b>. Similarly, the HIMS <b>60</b> may communicate to the IV pump with a transmission signal <b>67</b> <i>a </i>to the nurse's hand-held communication unit <b>98</b> and the retransmission signal <b>67</b> <i>b </i>from the hand-held communication unit <b>98</b> to the IV pump <b>10</b>. It maybe understood that the doctor's transmitter and the nurses hand-held unit may be the same or similar type of wireless communication devices used for different purposes at different parts of the system by different professional healthcare givers.</p>
    <p>To understand how the IV pump communication with HIMS may fit in the entire IV medication delivery process and system <b>9</b>, we may look at the doctor's initiation of the patient order <b>82</b>. This order may be communicated via wireless transmitter <b>83</b>. A wireless signal from the doctor's transmitter <b>83</b> may be received directly by the IV pump <b>10</b> as indicated by dashed line <b>87</b>i. Alternatively, the doctor's order may be wirelessly transmitted and received by the pharmacy transceiver <b>88</b>, as indicated by dashed line signal <b>87</b>ii. In the case where the doctor's order requires blood products or other laboratory prepared IV solutions, the doctor's order may be transmitted to and received by a laboratory receiver or transceiver <b>93</b> via wireless signal <b>87</b>iii. Alternatively, the doctor's transmitter <b>83</b> may provide a signal <b>87</b>iv to be received by the HIMS transceiver <b>61</b>. The HIMS may be used to re-transmit the doctor's order with or without appropriate modifications such as additional instructional information to the pharmacy via wireless signal <b>95</b> or to the laboratory <b>93</b> via wireless signal <b>97</b>. The pharmacy <b>88</b> or the lab <b>93</b> may be provided with a transceiver such that medication orders received in the pharmacy <b>88</b> or received in the lab <b>93</b>, whether received from the HIMS or from the doctor's order transmitter <b>83</b> or otherwise, may be then appropriately prepared for administration to the intended and properly identified patient <b>20</b>. The doctor's order, with additional instruction from the pharmacy as appropriate for a particular medication preparation or for a particular patient, may be transmitted via a wireless signal, wireless signal <b>91</b> in the case of the pharmacy and wireless signal <b>99</b> in the case of the lab, to the IV pump <b>10</b>. The prepared medication or the prepared blood product or other laboratory IV solution container is then physically provided to the nurse's station for delivery to the pumping unit at the patient's hospital room, as indicated by the solid line and direction arrow head to block <b>81</b> in FIG. <b>3</b>. The prepared IV medication container or prepared blood product container <b>12</b> is then appropriately attached to the IV pump <b>10</b>. The IV pump <b>10</b> may receive a wireless signal indicating the appropriate instruction pumping characteristics for the IV fluid container that is connected to the IV pump <b>10</b> for the identified patient <b>20</b>. Such infusion data and pumping characteristics will nevertheless need to be validated by the nurse in order to maintain the integrity of the system. For example, the nurse may enter the information from the IV fluid container identifying the medication, may also identify the patient, and may provide the nurse's identification consistent with authorization to administer medications to the patient. The pump operation data may be downloaded from the doctor's order, from the pharmacy instructions or from the HIMS <b>60</b>. For purposes of central administration control, the doctor's order and/or the pharmacy instructions may be wirelessly received at the HIMS and such order and instructions may be checked and corroborated with patient information and/ or medical information stored in the HIMS for purposes of confirming proper administration to the patient. In that embodiment, the nurse may activate wireless downloading of pump operation data from the HIMS <b>60</b> to IV pump <b>10</b>, as, for example, by wireless signal <b>67</b>.</p>
    <p>It will be noted in FIG. 3 that the inventive wireless IV pump system works with and as a compliment to other health-care services provided to the patient and managed with a hospital information management system. For example, the patient admissions information <b>19</b> may be provided directly to the HIMS. Also, where the pharmacy prepares oral, topical or intramuscular medications, those medications may be delivered to a nurse's station as indicated by solid arrow to block <b>27</b> and the oral, topical or intramuscular medication may be recorded and administered to the patient as indicated by solid arrow to block <b>31</b>. The patient outcome may be further monitored appropriately as with a patient's written chart <b>33</b> and that information may be conveyed to the HIMS, as indicated by arrow <b>35</b>. In this manner, the HIMS <b>60</b> may receive information from any combination of various elements, or from all of the various elements of the patient health-care system <b>9</b>. The information maybe appropriately used in providing billing data at block <b>21</b>, providing a patient history file at block <b>23</b> and/or providing a medication administration record (MAR) at block <b>25</b>.</p>
    <p>In FIG. 3 a nurse's hand-held communication unit <b>98</b> is also shown in the phantom lines, for purposes of indicating yet another alternative embodiment of the system. Additional aspects of this alternative embodiment may also be understood, with reference also to FIG. <b>4</b>. The nurse may use a hand-held communication unit <b>98</b> to manually enter information from a label on an IV container. The nurse may transmit the instructional data to the IV pump and upon confirming that the patient, medication and pumping data match, the nurse may initiate IV pumping. Alternatively a hand-held communication unit <b>98</b> specially adapted with bar code reading capabilities may be used to scan an IV container bar code information. Further alternatively, the nurse may receive a pharmacy medication instruction signal wirelessly and/or a doctor's order signal wirelessly by which the patient medication can be compared to the label on the physical IV container of fluid. As a further alternative, the nurse may enter an appropriate patient and IV medication identification into the hand-held communications unit <b>98</b> and this identification may be wirelessly transmitted to access the HIMS for receiving from the HIMS such information and instructions for IV pump administration of the identified IV medication to the identified patient. Those pump characteristics maybe transmitted to the hand-held unit via signal <b>67</b> <i>a </i>and retransmitted to the IV pump from the hand-held communications unit via wireless signal <b>67</b> <i>b</i>. Again upon confirming the information loaded into the IV pump, the nurse may activate pumping operations.</p>
    <p>The hand-held communications unit <b>98</b> can similarly be used by the nurse to receive a wireless signal from the IV pump, indicating the IV pump operation characteristics at any point in time. The nurse may choose to poll any given IV pump as by using individual pump identification codes or addresses. Alternatively, the entire operation log for IV pump operation characteristics over a period of time might be uploaded to the handheld unit <b>98</b> on the command of the nurse. The pump operation characteristics, received by wireless signal <b>49</b> <i>a</i>, can then be retransmitted to the HIMS as by a wireless signal <b>49</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
    <p>This alternative embodiment may be more fully understood with reference to FIG. 4 in which only the nurse's hand-held communication unit <b>98</b>, the HIMS <b>60</b> and the IV pump <b>10</b> are depicted as an alternative inventive subcombination of the invention. In this subcombination, the information from the IV pump is transmitted via wireless signal <b>49</b> <i>a </i>and is received by the hand-held unit <b>98</b>. The information may be displayed to the nurse and the nurse may retransmit the received information via signal <b>49</b> <i>b </i>to the HIMS <b>60</b>. Similarly, the nurse may wish to compare the current pump operation characteristics <b>15</b>, represented and received as wireless signal <b>49</b> <i>a</i>, with the desired pump operation characteristics received from the HIMS. The nurse may do this by way of activating and receiving a wireless signal <b>67</b> <i>a </i>from the HIMS to the hand-held unit <b>98</b>. Thus in certain appropriate situations, the HIMS operational instructions represented by signal <b>67</b> <i>a </i>may be transmitted by the hand-held unit activated by the nurse as a wireless signal <b>67</b> <i>b </i>to the IV pump <b>10</b>. Where a plurality of IV pumps <b>10</b>, <b>10</b> <i>b</i>, <b>10</b> <i>c</i>, <b>10</b> <i>d</i>, and <b>10</b> <i>z </i>may be present pump identification codes may be used to access only the desired pump. The IV pump id would likely be readable from the pump itself so that there is no doubt that the proper pump at the identified patient's bedside is being accessed and /or programmed for infusion operation by the nurse.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5 schematically depicts an enhanced security operating sequence for operating an IV pump with wireless signal transmitter <b>10</b> as well as the nurse's hand-held wireless signal transmitter <b>98</b>. In this method, a nurse brings up a patient's medication administration record (MAR) on the hand-held unit <b>98</b> at step <b>69</b>. The nurse then confirms that the infusion data and IV pump operating characteristics are appropriate for the MAR information for the identified patient at step <b>71</b>. Where the characteristics are appropriate, data is communicated to the HIMS at step <b>73</b> and the nurse activates the read-wireless data menu on the IV pump at step <b>75</b>. With the read-wireless data menu item activated, the infusion data and characteristics are transmitted to the pump via wireless signal, according to step <b>77</b> in FIG. <b>5</b>. With the infusion pump characteristics thus entered wirelessly into the infusion pump, the nurse may validate that the data received by the IV pump is correct. This may be done by observing the pump display <b>40</b>. Upon validating the accuracy of the entry, the beginning of infusion may be authorized at step <b>79</b>.</p>
    <p>In each embodiment the IV pump has at least one transmitter for transmitting at least one wireless signal to the HIMS. The transmitter is operatively connected to certain pump operation circuitry for monitoring preselected pump operations and for transmitting a wireless signal representing such preselected pump operational characteristics indicative of IV administration of the patient medication to a patient. The HIMS is provided with a wireless signal receiver capable of receiving the signals from the IV pump transmitter.</p>
    <p>While the IV pump <b>10</b> is operating, the operational characteristics <b>15</b> of the pump may be monitored with appropriately connected circuitry, software or a combination of circuitry and software all referred to herein as circuitry <b>41</b>. The monitoring maybe done continuously, at regular intervals, at predetermined irregular intervals, or upon the occurrence of predetermined events, or upon the occurrence of any event that changes the state of the pump. By way of example, such state change events could include starting or stopping, changing of infusion rate, activation of an alarm, or approaching a predetermined time in advance of an anticipated event. The information regarding the pump operation is transmitted by the wireless pump transmitter to the HIMS wireless signal receiver. Again information acceptance, storage, comparison and/or etc., may be performed by HIMS programs or circuitry. Information wirelessly transmitted to the HIMS by the pump transmitter may include other information such as medication name, patient ID, and nurse ID when available in addition to operational characteristics . Also, pump alarm conditions, malfunction conditions, and maintenance conditions may also be transmitted.</p>
    <p>End of infusion warnings may be advantageously signaled according to one alternative inventive aspect of the invention. For certain types of medication such as antibiotics, causative medications, vasoactive medications and anti-blood clotting medications, the end of infusion warnings will desirably be programmed or programmable to occur with sufficient lead time for the HIMS to “notify” the pharmacist to prepare the next medical solution and have it delivered to the patient's IV pump before the current bag is completely emptied. Other information such as administrative information including for example specific pump ID, pump location and hours of operation, and any maintenance reports may also be transmitted to the HIMS via wireless signal transmission. For example spaced apart HIMS receiver nodes with known locations throughout the hospital or health care facility may receive signals from the plurality of IV pumps and by pump ID codes and signal strength and/or signal direction means the location of the pumps within the facility may be determined.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment the pump may also be capable of downloading the pump operation log (Op log). For example, the Op log may be transmitted to the HIMS at each nurse shift change, at regular timed intervals, or upon receipt of a HIMS inquiry signal transmitted to the IV pump.</p>
    <p>Wireless communication between the doctor's order transmitter <b>83</b>, the pharmacy transmitter <b>88</b>, and the IV pump transmitter <b>45</b> or between any combination or from all of the components may also facilitate medical administration to a patient in a hospital or other institution or health-care facility.</p>
    <p>A computer processor <b>57</b> of the HIMS <b>60</b> may be provided that is capable of storing the information represented by the received signals. The HIMS <b>60</b> may also include software or circuitry that is capable of comparing doctor's order for patient medication with pharmacy instructions and/or capable of comparing the doctor's order or the pharmacy instructions with the wirelessly transmitted IV pump characteristics indicative of the actual delivery of medication to the patient. The HIMS may be programmed for comparing the doctor's order to the actual pump operation delivery characteristics. The comparison may for example, confirm successful doctor ordered delivery or it might determine that delivery was not completed as instructed. According to yet another alternative configuration of the invention, the HIMS will be able to display, in human readable form, the order, the pump operation characteristics and the results of the comparison indicative of successful completion of administration of this ordered medication to the patient or otherwise. The HIMS can be useful to communicate the information to billing at <b>21</b>, to patient history files at <b>23</b>, and to a medication administration record (MAR) at <b>25</b> for monitoring safe and secure records of medications, especially controlled substances. In yet other possible combinations with the present invention the type of blood product to be infused might be compared to patient blood type information in the HIMS or patient allergies to medications to be infused might be compared to HIMS records for the patient.</p>
    <p>In yet another embodiment the pharmacist's instructions in bar code format may be scanned into the IV pump from a bar coded IV bag, bottle, syringe or other container labeled by the pharmacist and scanned with a bar code scanner connected with the IV pump. The bar code scanning capability may be selectively activated by an authorized nurse or other authorized healthcare professional. Upon activation, the nurse is prompted to scan a nurse's ID, which ID includes a special authorized user code. If the authorization code is present, then the pump prompts the nurse to scan in the patient's ID. When the patient ID is properly scanned, then the nurse is prompted to scan information from the pharmaceutical fluid container, whether a bag, a bottle, a syringe or another container. Upon reading information from the label of the container of medicinal fluid, pump control software displays an appropriate display of the name of the drug identified by the bar code label. The software may further capture the drug name, the concentration, concentration volume, volume to be delivered and infusion rate, if not calculated. All of these operation characteristics might be selected for wireless transmission to the HIMS. If all of the required infusion information is validated by the nurse, then the infusion maybe initiated according to the accurately scanned infusion information such as the volume to be delivered and infusion rate that is read directly from the infusion information bar code label on the fluid container and into a control program of the infusion pump. If any of the required information cannot be accurately validated by the nurse, then the scan mode is exited and the nurse must manually input the required data and infusion rates into the pump software control program using control panel buttons, toggles and displays. Any portion or all of the pump operation activity may be transmitted wirelessly to the HIMS or it may be stored in the a pump operation log that may subsequently be transmitted via wireless signal to the HIMS. Any or all of this information might be selected for transmission to the HIMS for storage or for comparison to the doctor's order. If there is a mismatch, an alarm or warning might be issued to the appropriate personnel or directly to the IV pump.</p>
    <p>According to the alternative embodiment shown in phantom lines at <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> in FIG. 2, the pump housing <b>11</b> also carries an operably connected bar code scanner <b>62</b>, having a scanner window <b>64</b> depicted on the side of the pumping housing <b>11</b>, it being understood that the scanner window <b>64</b> might also be in another position or otherwise directed for usefulness of the pump, however in the embodiment depicted where a plurality of pumps <b>10</b> might be stacked one on top of the other, attached through pole clamps <b>28</b> to a pole <b>29</b>, it is preferred to provide the scanning window <b>64</b> facing toward a side or toward the front. The side being advantageous as a position for the bar code scanning window because of the effective use of the front panel <b>22</b> for display and manual programming.</p>
    <p>The bar code scanner <b>62</b> is useful with a container <b>12</b>, having a pharmacist prepare therapeutic fluids <b>70</b> therein. The container is provided with a bar code label <b>66</b> and preferably also a human readable printed infusion data label <b>68</b> corresponding to the bar code information on bar code label <b>66</b>. The operator may activate the scanning mode by using menu and cursor keys to activate a menu item. The pump will prompt the user to provide certain required security information, such as including a scan of a nurse's ID badge or card. A nurse's ID badge will preferably have a unique identification code number and also an appropriate authorization code. Only with the authorization code and the nurse's ID can the scanning mode be continued. Subsequent to scanning in the nurse's ID, a unique patient ID must be scanned, as from a patient wrist band or a patient ID card, having a bar code to uniquely identify the patient by name and/or by patient number. After the nurse's ID and the patient's ID are appropriately scanned and confirmed, as by using the “E” or “enter” button <b>100</b> or other appropriate confirmation, then the bar code label <b>66</b> of the medication container <b>12</b> can also be scanned. The bar code label on the medication container <b>12</b> is prepared by a pharmacist that also prepares the medication <b>17</b>. The infusion information may include the unique patient identification field <b>72</b>, the drug name or identification <b>74</b>, a dosage <b>76</b>, a rate <b>78</b> and other infusion information <b>80</b>, as may be appropriate. For purposes of further confirmation, all the requisite information may also be printed in a human readable label <b>68</b> corresponding to the bar code fields that are scanned for convenience and accuracy.</p>
    <p>FIG. 6 is a schematic flow diagram of the operation of one alternative embodiment of a wireless signal transmitter pump in a system for improved accuracy and security using wireless signal transmission to a HIMS. In this flow diagram, the initial step is for the doctor to make an order for medication as at step <b>100</b>. The order for the medication goes to a qualified pharmacist and, in particular, a pharmacist who prepares medications for the institution at which the infusion will be administered as indicated by arrow <b>102</b>. In step <b>104</b> the pharmacist receives the order and validates the acceptability of the medication ordered for a particular patient. If, for any of a number of reasons, the pharmacist believes that the medication is not acceptably written by the doctor, then the pharmacist sends the order back to the doctor, as indicated by arrow <b>106</b>, so that the order may be rewritten to be acceptable to the pharmacist. In the event that the order is acceptable, then the pharmacist moves to the next step, as indicated by arrow <b>108</b>, to step <b>110</b> for the preparation of the medication according to the doctor's written order. Immediately upon preparing the medication per the doctor's order, the pharmacist then moves to the next step, as indicated by process arrow <b>112</b>, to step <b>114</b>, where the pharmacist prepares a label <b>116</b> for the medication. With additional information available to the pharmacist through the healthcare facility's admission records as stored in the HIMS, the prepared labels may also include the patient's name, the patient's identification number, as assigned in the admissions procedure. The label includes the drug name, according to the preparation made by the pharmacist, the concentration, the concentration volume, the volume to be delivered and the infusion rate, if not calculated. The patient's height and weight may also be provided or other appropriate infusion data, if it is applicable to the therapy anticipated by the infusion. Referring again to FIG. 2, the pharmacist may be provided with a wireless transmitter <b>88</b> connected to an input <b>91</b> and keyboard <b>93</b> terminal by which the information for the medication is entered into the terminal <b>91</b> and transmitted via transmitter <b>88</b> to the HIMS <b>60</b> receiver <b>61</b>. The pharmacist may prepare human readable labels and may also be provided with bar code specifications, to provide labels bar code readable by the infusion pump.</p>
    <p>The pharmacist then releases the container <b>12</b> of the medication <b>70</b> and transmits the medication data to the HIMS. The medication itself is then delivered at <b>118</b> to a nursing unit appropriately assigned to the identified patient <b>20</b>, as indicated at step <b>120</b>. The assigned nurse or other authorized healthcare professional then carries the medication container <b>12</b> to the patient's room, bedside and infusion pump where the medication data including pump operating instructions are input into the pump control circuitry, as indicated by arrow <b>122</b>. The nurse or other authorized healthcare professional might scan the infusion information into the pump where a bar code scanner is available, or might input the infusion data manually, or might activate wirelessly transmission of IV information to the IV pump as indicated by decision box <b>124</b>. The pharmacist may wirelessly transmit the medical information to the HIMS. In the embodiment where the IV pump is also provided with a wireless receiver (or a transceiver), the data may be transmitted to the IV pump directly from the doctor, the pharmacist, the HIMS or from the nurse's handheld communication unit. This provides the healthcare institution with the options to instruct authorized personnel to input the data manually, to provide bar code labels to allow the data to be scanned in for improved administration capabilities provided by the bar code scanner or to download the medication instructions from the HIMS. In any event, the nurse validates the input data as it is displayed at the pump before initiating pumping.</p>
    <p>The healthcare institution may phase in the use of the wireless pump communication capabilities, or alternatively, may determine appropriate criteria for internal purposes for wireless transmission of certain types of infusion medications, scanning other types of data and/or manually inputting other data. The infusion pump may be provided with recording capabilities such as computer chip memory, so that appropriate infusion data is recorded in an operation log (Op log) reviewable for administration purposes, for quality control purposes and, importantly, for purposes of the physician's review to determine appropriate continued or future treatment or medications for the patient. The recorded pump information may be wirelessly transmitted to HIMS. If the manual input mode is selected as indicated by arrow <b>126</b>, then the nurse enters the infusion data from the control panel <b>22</b>, as indicated by action block <b>128</b>. When the automatic infusion data entry is determined to be appropriate, as indicated by arrow <b>130</b>, the nurse then prepares the pump for input data or for wireless transmission input, as indicated at step <b>132</b>.</p>
    <p>Preparation of the pump for bar code input or wireless input includes not only turning the pump on, as with a power button <b>56</b>, but also setting the pump for the automatic bar code scanning mode or wireless receiving mode. This may be done from a menu or otherwise depending upon the pump controls. When the pump is determined to be in the scan mode, as indicated by arrow <b>134</b>, the nurse will be prompted to scan in a nurse's ID with a bar code on an ID tag (also made with a compatible bar code labeling system for use with the bar code module used in the device). Advantageously, all authorized healthcare professionals employed by the healthcare facility with qualifications for establishing an infusion to a patient, will be provided with an identification tag, badge, card or other coded identifier having a specialized authorization code. If the authorization code is present, the automatic bar code scanner may be initialized for establishing infusion data for a patient, as indicated by block <b>138</b>. If the authorization code is not present or if the nurse does not scan in an appropriate ID, then the automatic system requires the nurse to exit the scan mode, as indicated by arrow <b>140</b>. If infusion continues to be desired after the scan mode is exited, then the nurse decides, at block <b>142</b>, whether to move to the manual input mode, as indicated by arrow <b>144</b>, thus moving the nurse back to block <b>128</b> for manually inputting data into the pump, or to start over with the scan mode initialization.</p>
    <p>If the nurse's ID is properly entered at <b>136</b> and if the authorization code is present in the entered ID, as indicated by <b>138</b>, then the control software allows the nurse to proceed, as indicated by arrow <b>146</b>. The nurse is prompted to scan in the patient's ID, at step <b>148</b>. The patient's ID may appropriately be established with a wristband having a bar code for the patient's ID set forth thereon, or alternatively, where the patient's care limits the availability of using the wrist band for scanning purposes, the patient's ID may be on a patient card, a patient badge, or on the patient's chart, or other bedside available bar code so that proper patient identification is securely established. According to a preferred security check, a patient ID must be scanned in order for the automatic bar code scanning mode to continue. If the patient's ID is not scanned, as indicated by arrow <b>152</b>, the nurse is then returned to decide whether to manually input the data into the pump, as at decision block <b>142</b> and manual input block <b>128</b>, as described above.</p>
    <p>If the patient ID is scanned, as indicated with arrow <b>154</b>, the nurse will be prompted to either scan in the infusion information from the container, as set forth in action block <b>156</b>, or receive a wireless signal from the HIMS. The scanning of the information from the container would involve scanning the bag, bottle, syringe or other medication container past the bar code scanner window <b>64</b> with an appropriate confirmation that the scanning was completed, as by an audible sound signal, a visual signal or both. If the container information is readably scanned from the container, then the process would move forward, as indicated by arrow <b>158</b>. If not, then, as indicated by return arrow <b>160</b>, the nurse would be again returned to decision block <b>142</b> and manual input action block <b>128</b>.</p>
    <p>In the event that all the infusion data can be appropriately validated by the nurse or healthcare professional at the pump, as set forth in step <b>168</b>. If the nurse cannot validate the input or any aspect of the input, then the system returns the nurse, as indicated by line <b>170</b>, to exit the scan mode at <b>142</b> and to either move to the manual input <b>128</b> or otherwise correct the situation. Assuming the nurse can validate the accuracy of all the required input data as automatically downloaded, then the nurse initiates the infusion, as indicated by arrow <b>172</b> and action step <b>174</b>.</p>
    <p>A wireless communication system from an IV medication infusion pump to a hospital information management system (HIMS) is provided including a medication order transmitter capable of receiving input of a doctor's order for patient medication to be administered with an IV pump. The IV pump is uniquely capable of wireless transmission of a first signal representing the input doctor's order for patient medication that is to be administered intravenously, namely using the IV pump. A pharmacist receiver is provided that is capable of receiving the first signal representing the doctor's order for medication and having circuitry for providing the order for patient medication in human readable form for the preparation of ordered patient medication for IV pump administration. The medication according to the doctor's orders as may be enhanced or supplemented by the pharmacist for proper administration to the patient are provided to the IV pump. The IV pump having a receiver for receiving the first signal indicating the doctors order, also has a transmitter for transmitting a wireless signal that might be designated a second signal for discussion purposes. The transmitter is operatively connected to certain pump operation circuitry for monitoring preselected pump operations and for transmitting such a second wireless signal representing preselected pump operation characteristics indicative of IV administration of the patient medication to a patient. A hospital information management system is provided with a signal receiver capable of receiving the first and second signals. A computer component of the HIMS that is capable of storing the information represented by the received signals is also provided with software or circuitry that is capable of comparing doctor's order for patient medication with the IV pump characteristics indicative of delivery of medication to the patient. The HIMS is thus programmed for comparing the doctor's order to the actual pump operation delivery characteristics . The comparison may for example, confirm successful doctor ordered delivery or it might determine that delivery was not completed as instructed. The HIMS will be able to display the order, the pump operation characteristics and the results of the comparison indicative of successful completion of administration of said ordered medication to said patient or otherwise.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment the pumping instructions in bar code format may be scanned into the IV pump from a bar coded IV bag, bottle, syringe or other container labeled by the pharmacist and scanned with a bar code scanner connected with the IV pump.</p>
    <p>Thus, what has been disclosed is a system and medical infusion pump with bar code reading and wireless communication capabilities, to provide pump operation characteristics to an HIMS in a hospital or other healthcare institution or facility. The medical infusion pump with the bar code reader, the wireless signal transmitter and the HIMS capable of receiving, storing and displaying information derived from the operation characteristics also forms a part of a patient care system. The patient care system provides for an authorized pharmacist to prepare and label infusion fluids including medicines, drugs, and other pharmacological infusion products to be infused to patients upon doctor's orders. The labeling information may include patient ID, patient height, patient weight, drug information and drug administration dosage and rate information. The patient's doctor orders medicines directly from the pharmacist and the pharmacist prepares the infusion fluid and labels the container from which the fluid will be infused to the patient. The pump is provided with operation parameter monitoring circuitry connected to a wireless transmitter by which the characteristics are transmitted to the HIMS. The authorized healthcare professional such as the nurse must scan in their own personal ID and an authorization code to indicate their authorization to administer medicines to the patient. The authorized user confirms the accuracy of the pump operational instructions prior to administration of the medicine to the patient. Thus only an authorized healthcare giver such as an identified nurse is permitted to activate the pump for operating according to information loaded into the pump control circuitry or software after confirming that the patient information as well as the drug administration information as it is displayed at the pump. In any event whether the IV pump is instructed to operate wirelessly, with a bar code scanner, manually or otherwise, the wireless transmission of IV pump operation characteristics to the HIMS is advantageous to the patient and to the hospital for increasing the security, efficiency and effectiveness of health care provided to patients requiring IV medications and treatments.</p>
    <p>Other alterations and modifications of the invention will likewise become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the present disclosure, and it is intended that the scope of the invention disclosed herein be limited only by the broadest interpretation of the appended claims to which the inventors are legally entitled.</p>
