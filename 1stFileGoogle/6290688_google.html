    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>This invention relates to medical connectors used in the treatment of the injured or sick, and in particular to a connector for introducing medication into a patient in a safe, convenient way.</p>
    <p>2. Background Discussion</p>
    <p>It is a common practice in treating patients, particularly patients who must be cared for under emergency conditions, with medication introduced into the patient intravenously. An intravenous solution, commonly referred to as parenteral liquid, is fed from a container holding this liquid. The liquid flows through tubing into a needle which has been inserted into the patient's vein, The needle is taped securely to the patient's body and is not likely to pull loose if the patient moves. Medication needed to sustain the life of the patient, for example, drugs which maintain the blood pressure of the patient at the desired level, are added to the parenteral liquid. The conventional practice is to introduce the medication through a second needle inserted into a sealed entry port in the tubing through which the parenteral liquid flows.</p>
    <p>One problem with this conventional practice is that the needle may be pulled loose from the sealed port relatively easily. Such accidental removal of the needle from the sealed port can have very serious consequences and could even lead to the death of the patient. Although many hospitals require nurses to tape the needle securely to the tubing, this is not always done, because taping is a burdensome and time consuming task.</p>
    <p>A second problem with the conventional practice is needle sticks. From time to time a nurse in attempting to insert the needle into the sealed entry port will accidentally stick himself or herself with the needle. This often occurs under emergency conditions when the nurse is under pressure to complete this task as quickly as possible. Not only is the accomplishment of the task delayed, but the nurse must stop working and have a blood test performed. Such a test is needed in case the nurse becomes infected, because the hospital will be responsible financially. Consequently, needle sticks not only result in increased hospital cost, but are a possible life treating event to the nurse.</p>
    <p>A third problem with the conventional practice is infection. All too often a patient's life is seriously endangered by bacteria gaining entry into a patient's blood stream and infecting the patient. In a vast number of cases it is unknown how the bacteria gain entry. We have observed conditions in hospitals and identified that one likely way the bacteria gain entry is by contamination of the needle inserted into the sealed entry port. This happens when the nurse notices that the needle has been pulled loose and simply reinserts it even though it may now have on its surface bacteria picked up by direct contact with, for example, the patient's bedding. Another possible way that bacteria may gain entry into the patient's blood stream is through contamination of the tape used to hold the needle to the connector.</p>
    <heading>MAJOR FEATURES OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The problems discussed above present a serious health hazard to patients and their nurses. The present invention eliminates these problems and provides a medical connector which is both safe and convenient to use.</p>
    <p>There are several features of this invention which contribute to its safety and convenience, no single one of which is solely responsible for these desirable attributes. Many of these features were present in our experimental versions of the invention, which were improved after testing. Without limiting the scope of this invention as expressed by the claims, its more prominent features will now be discussed briefly. After considering this discussion, and particularly after reading the section of this application entitled DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING, one will understand how the features of this invention provide the attributes of safey and convenience.</p>
    <p>One safety feature of this invention is the use of a cap member to enclose the needle to be inserted into the sealed entry port structure. This cap member fits snugly over the entry port structure, connecting with the port structure in a male-female mating relationship. The needle pierces the seal when the cap member is seated on the port structure. This needle is housed deep within a cavity in the cap member that terminates in an open mouth into which the sealed end of the port structure fits. This open mouth is narrow in width so that the finger of the nurse or patient cannot fit into the cavity and contact the needle. Since the needle is so mounted within the cap member, the likelihood of bacterial contamination is avoided or reduced and the nurse is protected against accidental needle sticks.</p>
    <p>A second safety feature is provided by the wall design of the cap member and port structure. These walls are of preferably cylindrical configuration and engage each other like a telescope. The interior surface of the wall of the cap member slides over the exterior surface of the wall of the mating port structure, with these walls engaging each other to guide the needle into the center of the seal. This ensures that the needle does not scrape against the inside surface of the wall of the port structure. Particles scraped from this wall could make their way into the patient's blood stream and result in death. This potentially lethal condition is inherent in the design of conventional devices. But the connector of this invention, with the guideway wall design of the cap member and port structure, ensures that the needle is directed into the center of the seal so that it avoids scraping against the inside surface of the wall of the port structure. This guideway wall design also permits the nurse quickly to connect the cap member to the port structure. This makes the connector of this invention not only more convenient to use, but in emergencies, enables the nurse to administer medication to a patient faster than with conventional devices and doing it without the danger of needle sticks.</p>
    <p>A third safety feature of the invention is that a locking mechanism detachably secures the cap member to the port structure. Because of this feature, movement of the patient does not result in accidental removal of the needle from the seal. Although many different types of locking mechanisms may be employed, the preferred one provides a sound upon locking engagement of the cap member and port structure. We have devised such a locking mechanism which produces a sound such as a “click.” This “click” is an audible signal which tells the nurse that the cap member is locked safely to the port structure and cannot be accidentally jarred loose by movement of the patient.</p>
    <p>Several embodiments of the invention illustrating all the features of this invention will now be discussed in detail. These embodiments show the invention being used for administering medication intravenously to a patient. This invention may also be used to administer medication to a patient in other ways, for example, intracranially or intraperitonially.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING</heading> <heading>Conventional Connector System</heading> <p>As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the current way of intravenously introducing parenteral liquid into a patient is by the conventional feeding system <b>10</b>. This feeding system <b>10</b> includes a container <b>12</b> for the parenteral liquid, a tube <b>14</b> extending from the container and connected to a Y or “piggyback” connector <b>16</b>, and a tube <b>18</b> from the piggyback connector to a needle (not shown) inserted into a vein of the patient. The needle is taped to the patient so that movement of the patient will not result in the needle being pulled from the patient's vein.</p>
    <p>As best illustrated in FIG. 2, medication from the container <b>20</b> is introduced through the piggyback connector <b>16</b> into the parenteral liquid flowing through the feeding system <b>10</b>. This piggyback connector <b>16</b> consists of two tubular conduits <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> which merge into a third tubular conduit <b>26</b>. The tubing <b>14</b> from the container <b>12</b> of parenteral liquid is inserted into the inlet port <b>28</b> of the conduit <b>22</b> and secured in position, for example, by an adhesive which bonds the external surface of this tube to the internal wall surface of the conduit. There is a stop <b>30</b> which limits the extent to which this tube <b>14</b> can be inserted into the conduit. In a similar fashion, the tube <b>18</b> is secured to. the outlet port <b>32</b> of the piggyback connector. This tube <b>18</b> is inserted into the outlet port <b>32</b> until it abuts a stop <b>34</b> in the internal wall of the conduit. This tube <b>18</b> is secured by an adhesive to the internal wall of the conduit <b>26</b>.</p>
    <p>The sealed entry port structure of the conventional feeding system <b>10</b> is provided by the branch conduit <b>24</b> which has a standard latex rubber seal <b>36</b> at its inlet port <b>38</b> to seal this port. Consequently, bacteria cannot enter the piggyback connector <b>16</b> via the inlet port <b>38</b> because of the seal <b>36</b>. This seal <b>36</b> is of conventional design and includes coaxial annular aprons <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> which fit over the conduit wall <b>24</b> <i>a </i>and grip the external and internal wall surfaces to hold the seal securely to the conduit <b>24</b>. A suitable seal may be obtained from the West Company of Phoenixville, Pa.</p>
    <p>The medication is introduced into the parenteral liquid flowing through the piggyback connector <b>16</b> by a needle <b>44</b> which is inserted through the central part of the seal <b>36</b> into the branch conduit <b>24</b>. This needle <b>44</b> is connected by a suitable connector <b>46</b> to a tube <b>48</b> which is connected to the container <b>20</b> (FIG. 1) for the medication. As parenteral liquid flows through the piggyback connector <b>16</b> into the inlet port <b>28</b> and out the outlet port <b>32</b>, the medication is drawn into this stream of liquid, flowing from the container <b>20</b> via the tube <b>48</b> and through the open tip or end <b>44</b> <i>a </i>of the needle <b>44</b> into the parenteral liquid.</p>
    <p>After studying FIGS. 1 and 2, the several problems associated with the conventional practice can now be more fully understood. If the patient moves, for example, rolls or moves his or her arm, the needle <b>44</b> may be pulled from the seal <b>36</b>. If this occurs, the latex seal <b>36</b> has sufficient resiliency to close off the hole in the seal produced by the needle <b>44</b>. The parenteral liquid will continue to flow into the patient's system, but the necessary medication is no longer being introduced into it. The consequences of this condition are very grave and, if this condition is unnoticed by the nurse, it could result in the death of the patient or serious complications in the patient's treatment. Even if the nurse notices that the needle <b>44</b> has been removed from the seal <b>36</b> and reinserts it into the seal, it is possible that the needle has been contaminated with bacteria. The use of such a contaminated needle <b>44</b> is unacceptable, but nevertheless this sometimes happens. The needle <b>44</b> may be taped to the conduit <b>24</b>, and many hospitals instruct nurses to do this. When this task is done, the needle <b>44</b> is secured, but cannot be conveniently removed and then reinserted. And even when taping the needle <b>44</b>, if this is not done carefully, the needle may still be contaminated by the nurse touching the needle or the tape being contaminated. Also, because the nurse holds the conduit <b>24</b> with one hand while inserting the needle <b>44</b>, the nurse may accidentally stick the needle directly into the hand holding this conduit, or stick the needle through the conduit wall <b>24</b> <i>a </i>into this hand.</p>
    <p>These problems associated with the conventional practice are eliminated by the several different embodiments of this invention disclosed hereinafter.</p>
    <heading>First Embodiment of the Invention</heading> <p>As illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4, the first embodiment of this invention, connector <b>49</b>, employs a cap member <b>50</b> housing deep within the needle <b>44</b>. As will be discussed in greater detail hereinafter, the cap member <b>50</b> is secured by a slip-on/twist lock type of locking mechanism to the piggyback connector <b>16</b> so that movement of the patient does not result in the needle <b>44</b> being pulled from the seal <b>36</b>. The parenteral liquid is introduced via the conduit <b>24</b>, and the conduit <b>22</b> carries the seal <b>36</b> that covers the inlet port <b>28</b>. In this embodiment, this sealed conduit <b>28</b> constitutes the entry port structure <b>27</b>. The cap member <b>50</b> is detachably secured to th entry port structure <b>27</b>, with the needle <b>44</b> penetrating the center of the seal <b>36</b> when the cap member <b>50</b> mates with the port structure <b>27</b>.</p>
    <p>The cap member <b>50</b> comprises a cylindrical connector section <b>56</b> having a hollow interior forming the chamber or cavity <b>52</b> housing the needle <b>44</b>. This needle <b>44</b> is disposed lengthwise along the longitudinal axis of the cavity <b>52</b> and is centrally located. The cavity <b>52</b> has an open mouth <b>52</b> <i>a </i>which allows the cap member to be seated over the port structure <b>27</b>. The mouth <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, however, is constricted so that, as illustrated in FIG. 4<i>a</i>, it prevents the little finger of a typical adult user from being inserted into the cavity <b>52</b>. The tip or end <b>44</b> <i>a </i>of the needle is safely displaced inwardly from the open mouth <b>52</b> <i>a </i>so that even if the user intentionally inserted his or her finger into the open mouth, the tip of the needle would not stick this finger. Typically, the open mouth <b>52</b> <i>a </i>has a maximum width of no greater than about one centimeter, and the minimum distance between the mouth <b>52</b> <i>a </i>and the tip <b>44</b> <i>a </i>is about one centimeter.</p>
    <p>The locking mechanism includes the threads <b>69</b> <i>a </i>formed in the end <b>54</b> of the interior cavity wall <b>55</b> and the threads <b>69</b> <i>b </i>in the exterior wall of the conduit <b>22</b>. These threads <b>69</b> <i>a </i>and <b>69</b> <i>b </i>engage upon connection of the cap member <b>50</b> to the port structure <b>27</b> by screwing the cap member to the conduit <b>22</b>. The top of the cap member <b>50</b> has a pair of outwardly extending wings <b>58</b> which facilitate screwing the cap member <b>50</b> to the conduit <b>22</b>. As this is done, the interior wall <b>55</b>, sliding over the exterior surface of the conduit <b>22</b>, guides the needle <b>44</b> so that it penetrates the center of the seal <b>36</b>. To further ensure that the needle <b>44</b> penetrates the center of the seal <b>36</b>, the threads <b>69</b> <i>b </i>could be lowered further beneath the seal so that the cap member would fit telescopically over the conduit <b>22</b> and then be screwed into position. Thus, the cap member <b>50</b>, serving as the female component, and conduit <b>22</b>, serving as the male component, mate in a male-female relationship, with the needle <b>44</b> always being housed safely within the center of the cavity in an unexposed condition and positioned to pierce the center of the seal <b>36</b>.</p>
    <p>A spindle <b>59</b> is provided to enable the cap member <b>50</b> to be screwed onto the port structure <b>27</b> without twisting the tube <b>48</b>. This spindle <b>59</b> is received within an opening <b>61</b> within the cap member <b>50</b>. The body of the spindle <b>59</b> has a cylindrical neck section with a groove <b>63</b> in an end which protrudes from the opening <b>61</b>. The cylindrical body expands outwardly slightly to provide a shoulder <b>65</b> which engages a stop <b>66</b> when the spindle <b>59</b> is placed in the opening, and a TRU seal C-ring <b>67</b> is received in the groove <b>63</b> to hold the spindle in position but allowing the cap member to revolve about the spindle as it is screwed onto the port structure <b>27</b>.</p>
    <p>Along the longitudinal axis of the spindle <b>59</b> is a passageway <b>60</b>. The tube <b>48</b> from the container <b>20</b> holding the medication is inserted into the one end <b>60</b> <i>a </i>of the passageway <b>60</b> and is bonded to the internal surface of this passageway, for example, by means of an adhesive. The other end <b>60</b> <i>b </i>of the passageway terminates in a threaded connector section <b>62</b> to which the needle <b>44</b> is secured. This needle has an adapter <b>64</b> which has an internal thread which engages the threads of the connector section <b>62</b>. The needle <b>44</b> extends outwardly from this adapter <b>64</b>. Thus, the needle <b>44</b> is held secure to the piggyback connector <b>16</b>, penetrating the center of the seal <b>56</b> with its point <b>44</b> <i>a </i>safely displaced away from the inside wall <b>55</b> of the conduit <b>22</b>.</p>
    <p>This connector <b>49</b> embodies many of the features of this invention. For example, the cap member <b>50</b> safely houses the needle <b>44</b>, and the threads on the guiding walls provide means for detachably securing the cap member to the port structure without taping. But it has several components, and therefore is costly to manufacture, it is time consuming to screw the cap member <b>50</b> to the port structure, and it does not provide an audible signal when the cap member is safety secured to the port structure. This later feature is provided by the second and third embodiments of this invention.</p>
    <heading>Second Embodiment of the Invention</heading> <p>The second embodiment of the present invention, connector <b>71</b>, is shown in FIGS. 5 and 6. In this embodiment a cap member <b>70</b>, similar to cap member <b>50</b>, is simply snapped onto the piggyback connector <b>16</b>. The snap-on type locking mechanism of this connector <b>71</b> is easier to use and less costly to manufacture than the slip-on/twist type of the first embodiment.</p>
    <p>In this embodiment, the cap member <b>70</b> includes a hollow cylindrical element <b>72</b> which carries on its exterior two clips <b>74</b> which have catch tips <b>76</b> that snap into a groove <b>78</b> in the external wall of the conduit <b>22</b>. The clips <b>74</b> are mounted by hinges <b>75</b> to the element <b>72</b>, and are integral with the element <b>72</b>. A plug assembly <b>80</b> carries the tubing <b>48</b> and the needle <b>44</b>, which is mounted on an adapter <b>64</b> such as shown in FIG. <b>4</b>. This plug assembly <b>80</b> is glued or otherwise bonded to the open end of the cylindrical member <b>72</b>. The cap member <b>70</b>, including clips <b>74</b> and hinges <b>75</b>, are molded from the same material, for example, nylon, which is a material having the desired resiliency.</p>
    <p>To attach the cap member <b>70</b>, one simply slips the member <b>70</b> over the conduit <b>22</b>. The clips <b>74</b> bend outwardly slightly and, when the catch tips <b>76</b> of the clips are opposite the groove <b>78</b>, thus clips snap in place as shown in solid lines in FIG. <b>6</b>. The centrally mounted needle <b>44</b> is guided into the center of the seal <b>36</b> by the cap member <b>70</b>, which, like a telescope, slides over the tubular conduit <b>22</b>. There is shoulder <b>82</b> which serves as a stop to limit the movement of the cap member <b>70</b>. This shoulder <b>82</b> brings the catch tips <b>76</b> of the clips into registration with the groove <b>78</b>. The hinges <b>75</b>, being of the same material as the clips <b>74</b>, provide an internal bias or spring action due to the resiliency of the material from which these clips and hinges are made. Consequently, the clips <b>74</b> snap into a locking position, locking the cap member to the conduit <b>22</b> when the catch tips <b>76</b> are in registration with the groove <b>78</b>. To release the cap member from the piggyback connector <b>16</b>, the clips <b>74</b> are simply depressed and the cap member <b>70</b> is removed.</p>
    <p>One of the features of the slip-on type locking mechanism is that with one simple inwardly push the needle <b>44</b> is inserted directly into the center of the seal <b>36</b> and the cap member is locked to the port structure. Another feature of this connector <b>71</b> is that when the tips <b>76</b> of the clips snap into the groove <b>78</b> a “click” sound is made by the tips striking the body of the cap member. With repeated use, however, the hinges <b>75</b>, due to internal stress produced in the nylon material, loose some of their spring action. Consequently, the tips <b>76</b> are not held with sufficient force in the groove <b>78</b>, nor do they strike the body of the cap member to produce the desired “click” sound. Moreover, the material will eventually crack along the flex line of the hinge and a break will occur. The reliability of this connector <b>71</b> is substantially improved by the third embodiment, of this invention which employs a unique locking mechanism.</p>
    <heading>Third Embodiment of the Invention</heading> <p>As shown in FIG. 7, the third embodiment of this invention, connector <b>90</b>, includes a sealed port structure <b>91</b> and a cap member <b>92</b> having a locking mechanism <b>94</b> for detachably securing the cap member <b>92</b> to the port structure <b>91</b>. The cap member <b>92</b> is similar to the cap members of the other embodiments and houses within its cavity <b>92</b> <i>a </i>(FIG. 8) the needle <b>44</b>. The cavity <b>92</b> <i>a </i>has a tapered side wall <b>93</b> to better direct the needle <b>44</b> into the center of the seal <b>36</b>.</p>
    <p>The port structure <b>91</b> is a tubular conduit <b>102</b> having, at one end, a reduced diameter nipple <b>104</b> over which the seal <b>36</b> fits and, at the other end, a tapered barrel <b>103</b>. The seal <b>36</b> is of the same type employed in conventional devices such as shown in FIG. <b>2</b>. Material is removed from the barrel <b>103</b> to reduce cost. This results in the formation of flutes <b>103</b> <i>a </i>in the barrel <b>103</b>. At the base of the barrel <b>103</b>, adjacent the end of the port structure <b>91</b>, is an annular, disk-like piece which provides a lip <b>106</b>. When the cap member <b>92</b> is placed over the port structure <b>91</b>, a handle <b>96</b>, which is a component of the locking mechanism <b>94</b>, engages this lip <b>106</b>. The handle <b>96</b> is hinged to the body <b>98</b> of the cap member by a two component hinge <b>100</b>.</p>
    <p>As best shown in FIGS. 14 and 15, a hook <b>114</b> is one component of the hinge <b>100</b> and the other component of the hinge is a crossrod <b>108</b> (FIG. 18) carried by the handle <b>96</b>. The hook <b>114</b> projects outwardly from the body <b>98</b> of the cap member and has adjacent to it a ramp <b>116</b>, which as shown in FIG. 18, holds the crossrod <b>108</b> when the handle <b>96</b> is attached to the body of the cap member. A section of the crossrod <b>108</b> is cut away to provide a miter slot <b>118</b> which engages the ramp <b>116</b>.</p>
    <p>The handle <b>96</b> is best shown in FIGS. 12 and 13. It has a pair of spaced apart plates <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> extending downwardly from the underside of the handle and the crossrod <b>108</b> is disposed between these plates, with the opposed ends of the crossrod being integral with the plates. Opposite the crossrod <b>108</b> and parallel to it is a third plate <b>120</b>, which is integral with the underside of the handle <b>96</b> and is at a right angle to and connects with the forward ends of the plates <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>. Disposed on the underside of the handle <b>96</b> between the catch tip <b>122</b> and the plate <b>120</b> is a clapper bar <b>126</b>. The clapper bar <b>126</b> produces the “click” sound when it strikes the body <b>98</b> of the cap member. This clapper bar <b>126</b> extends away from the plate <b>120</b> at a right angle and is integral, at one end of the handle, with the catch tip <b>122</b> and, at its opposite end, with the plate <b>120</b>. The leading edge <b>124</b> of the catch tip <b>122</b> is beveled to facilitate the slippage of this tip up and over the lip <b>106</b> which is also beveled. At the point where the clapper bar <b>126</b> merges with the inside of the catch tip <b>122</b>, there is a notch <b>128</b>, which, as shown in FIG. 10, receives the lip <b>106</b> when the handle <b>96</b> is in the locking position. At the rearend of the handle <b>96</b> is a leaf spring <b>130</b> which has one end free and its opposed end integral with the handle <b>96</b>. At the free end of the leaf spring <b>130</b> are two spaced apart tracks <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> (FIG. <b>12</b>). When the handle <b>96</b> is attached to the body of the cap member as shown in FIGS. 8 through 10, a finger <b>136</b> on the body <b>98</b> of the cap member is received within the channel <b>138</b> between the tracks <b>132</b> and <b>134</b>. On the underside of the handle <b>96</b> are two downwardly projecting reinforcing strips <b>140</b> and <b>142</b> (FIG. 12) which provide structural rigidity to the handle.</p>
    <p>The way in which the handle <b>96</b> is pivotably connected to the cap member <b>92</b> by the two component hinge <b>100</b> is illustrated by FIGS. 16 through 19. To attach this handle <b>96</b> to the body <b>98</b> of the cap member, first one positions the handle over the body of the cap member opposite the hook <b>114</b> and then moves the handle into contact with the cap member so that the crossrod <b>108</b> touches the rearend of the ramp <b>116</b>. The spring <b>130</b> is depressed at this time. Next, the handle <b>96</b> is moved towards the left, as shown in FIG. 17, with the crossrod <b>108</b> sliding up the ramp <b>116</b> until it engages the leading edge <b>140</b> of the hook <b>114</b>. The dimension between the edge <b>142</b> of the ramp <b>116</b> and the edge <b>140</b> of the hook <b>114</b> is less than the diameter of the crossrod <b>108</b>. Consequently, the hook <b>114</b> must flex slightly upwardly in a counterclockwise direction, as viewed in FIG. 17, until the crossrod <b>108</b> clears the edge <b>142</b> of the ramp and snaps into the position shown in FIG. <b>18</b>. The hook <b>114</b> thus returns to the unflexed condition shown in FIG. 18, wrapping around the crossrod <b>108</b>. The miter slot <b>118</b> then engages the edge <b>142</b> of the ramp, with this edge abutting the junction <b>118</b> <i>a </i>of the slot <b>118</b> (FIG. <b>18</b>). The ramp <b>116</b> thus holds the crossrod <b>108</b> in position, preventing the handle from becoming dislodged from the hook <b>114</b> and preventing the handle <b>96</b> from tilting to-and-fro about its longitudinal axis. When the handle <b>96</b> is so mounted to the body <b>98</b> of the cap member, the finger <b>136</b> slips into the channel <b>138</b> between the tracks <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> and holds the rearend of the handle so that it does not tend to move laterally. The handle <b>96</b> is, however, free to pivot about the hinge <b>100</b>.</p>
    <p>Unlike the hinges <b>75</b> of the second embodiment of this invention, the two component hinge <b>100</b> does not break due to fatigue. Thus, in accordance with one feature of connector <b>90</b>, the handle <b>96</b> may be moved between a locked position (FIG. 10) and unlocked position (FIG. 8) as often as one wishes without breaking. At the same time, the handle <b>96</b>, coating with the body <b>98</b> of the cap member <b>92</b>, generates a “click” sound when the cap member is locked to the port structure <b>91</b>. This “click” sound, as best illustrated in FIGS. 9 and 10, occurs when the handle <b>96</b> moves between the flexed position shown in FIG. <b>9</b> and the locked position shown in FIG. <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>The connector <b>90</b> is highly reliable under actual hospital working conditions, and the way connector <b>90</b> is used is best shown in FIGS. 8 through 10<i>a</i>. First, the nurse inserts the end of the port structure carrying the seal <b>36</b> into the open mouth <b>93</b> of the cap member <b>92</b> to bring the lip <b>106</b> into engagement with the catch tip <b>122</b> of the handle <b>96</b> as shown in FIG. <b>8</b>. As this is done, the tapered side wall <b>93</b> of the cap member and the tapered barrel <b>103</b> slide along each other to direct the needle <b>44</b> into the center of the seal <b>36</b>. Simultaneously, the beveled edge <b>124</b> of the catch tip rides over the beveled lip <b>106</b> until the lip just engages the underside edge of this tip as shown in FIG. <b>9</b>. This causes the handle <b>96</b> to rotate in a clockwise direction as viewed in FIG. 9, with the crossroad <b>108</b> turning while in the grasp of the hook <b>114</b>. There is enough clearance between the miter slot <b>118</b> and the edge <b>142</b> of the ramp to allow the crossrod to turn sufficiently so the catch tip <b>122</b> clears the lip <b>106</b>. Thus the handle <b>96</b> pivots about the hinge <b>100</b>, depressing the spring <b>130</b>. With the handle <b>96</b> and lip <b>106</b> in this position and the spring <b>130</b> depressed, as soon as the lip <b>106</b> clears the edge of the catch tip <b>122</b>, the spring rotates the handle in a counterclockwise direction, moving it to the position shown in FIG. 10 with ample force so that the clapper bar <b>126</b> strikes the body <b>98</b> of the cap member to produce the “click” sound. This “click” sound is the audible signal which the nurse may rely upon to indicate that the cap member <b>96</b> is locked to the port structure <b>91</b>. Under certain hospital conditions, particularly in the intensive care unit where there is not a great deal of light, this is an important feature because it provides additional assurances that the cap member <b>92</b> is locked to the port structure <b>91</b>,</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 10, with the handle <b>96</b> in this locked position, the needle <b>44</b> has penetrated the central portion of the seal <b>36</b>, directed by the tappered sidewalls of the cavity <b>92</b> <i>a </i>and the barrel <b>103</b>. Medication now flows through the connector <b>90</b> into the patient. Note, the handle <b>96</b> is not depressed as the cap member <b>92</b> is slid over the port structure <b>91</b>. To remove the cap member <b>92</b>, the handle <b>96</b> is depressed, moving it to the position shown in FIG. 10<i>a</i>. With the handle <b>96</b> in this position, the cap member <b>92</b> is pulled off the port structure <b>91</b>.</p>
    <p>Except for the seal <b>36</b>, the connector <b>90</b> is made entirely of a transparent plastic. The use of a transparent plastic is preferred because this allows the nurse to see that the needle <b>44</b> is correctly inserted into the seal <b>36</b>, and thus provides additional safety. Also, the use of plastic makes the connector <b>90</b> a low cost, disposable item. The plastic most suitable is a polycarbonate made by Cyrolite Industries in Azusa, Calif. sold under the tradename Cyrolite. This plastic, which is commonly employed to make medical devices, has been approved for such uses by the United States Federal Drug Administration.</p>
    <p>The connector <b>90</b> is particularly adapted to be used in a variety of different applications. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 20, it may be connected directly in line with a container <b>144</b> of medication to be supplied intravenously to a patient. In this instance, the cap member <b>92</b> has a tube <b>146</b> extending from it which has at its one end a male component <b>148</b> of a conventional luer lock connector. This male component <b>148</b> engages and locks with a mating female luer component <b>150</b> attached to the end of a line <b>146</b> extending from the container <b>144</b>. In a similar manner, the port structure <b>91</b> has extending from it a tube <b>154</b> which has at its end a female luer component <b>158</b> of a second luer lock connector. The male component <b>156</b> of this second luer lock connector is attached to the end of a tube <b>160</b> that is connected to a needle inserted into the vein of the patient. The luer lock connectors may be obtained from Burron Medical, Inc. in Bethlehem, Pa.</p>
    <p>FIG. 21 illustrates the connector <b>90</b> integrated into a conventional piggyback connector <b>162</b>. The branch line <b>164</b> from the piggyback connector <b>162</b> has attached to it and integral therewith the port structure <b>91</b> including the lip <b>106</b> that engages the catch tip <b>122</b> of the locking mechanism <b>94</b>. Thus, a conventional feeding system <b>10</b> employing a piggyback connector may be modified by simply including a lip <b>106</b> adjacent the seal <b>36</b>. This lip <b>106</b> will then serve as the site for detachably connecting the cap member <b>92</b> to the piggyback connector <b>162</b>.</p>
    <p>The connector <b>90</b>, as shown in FIG. 22, also lends itself to be used with central venous catheters which are inserted into the chest of the patient. Frequently, patients under home care use such catheters, and consequently, even simpler and safer devices and techniques must be employed. However, a serious problem with such catheters is the way the ends of the lumens or tubes <b>166</b> and <b>168</b> extending from the patient are sealed. Presently, the ends of these tubes <b>166</b> and <b>168</b> are sealed using conventional luer locks. When it is time for the patient or the nurse to introduce medication into the catheter, an intermediate portion of the tubes <b>166</b> and <b>168</b> must be clamped while being connected to the source of medication so that air is not drawn into the blood stream of the patient. Any large intake of air into the patient's blood stream will seriously injure or even kill the patient. With children, even a small amount of air may be fatal. That is why clamps are used to close off the tubes <b>166</b> and <b>168</b> until the connection is made with the source of medication. This results in the tubes <b>166</b> and <b>168</b> wearing out, requiring that they be repaired. Not only is this a dangerous system, but it is extremely inconvenient for the patient or nurse to use.</p>
    <p>As illustrated in FIG. 22, the connector system <b>90</b> overcomes these difficulties by simply having at each of the respective ends of the tubes <b>166</b> and <b>168</b> port structures <b>91</b>. When the patient needs medication, he or she simply connects two of the cap members <b>92</b> to the respective port structures <b>91</b>, and when finished, disconnects the cap members. The medication is fed by the needles <b>44</b> through the seals <b>36</b> and into the respective tubes <b>166</b> and <b>168</b>. The cap members <b>92</b>, when detached, withdraw the needles <b>44</b> from the seals <b>36</b>, which are self sealing. Thus, the nurse does not need to clamp off the tubes <b>166</b> and <b>168</b> nor is periodic repair of the tubes required. Since the seal <b>36</b> is self-sealing, upon removal of the cap member <b>92</b> there is no danger of air being drawn through the port structure <b>91</b> into the patient's blood stream. Consequently, connector <b>90</b> is both safer and more convenient to use than the conventional central venous catheters.</p>
    <p>The connector <b>90</b> is also adapted to be used repeatedly without damaging the seal <b>36</b>. Thus it is even more suitable for such applications as illustrated in FIG. 22 than conventional devices, because of the accuracy with which the needle <b>44</b> may be repeatedly directed into the center of the seal <b>36</b>. When the needle <b>44</b> is repeatedly stuck into and withdrawn from the seal <b>36</b>, the seal will have numerous holes in it and begin to develop a “swiss cheese” like appearance. Eventually, a core is cut away from the seal by several of these holes interconnecting, rendering the seal useless because it is no longer self-sealing. Consequently, the seal would have a very short life. By carefully controlling the dimensions of the molds used to make connector <b>90</b>, the cap member <b>92</b> and port structure <b>91</b> will be precision made parts. Consequently, with repeated use, the needle <b>44</b> will essentially always penetrate the same hole in the seal <b>36</b>, thus avoiding the “coring” problem.</p>
    <heading>Fourth Embodiment of the Invention</heading> <p>The fourth embodiment of this invention, the connector <b>170</b>, is illustrated by FIGS. 23 and 24. In connector <b>170</b> the port structure <b>172</b> is similar to that shown in the other embodiments except it has a pair of pins on opposite sides of its body <b>178</b> which co-act with J-type slits <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> in the sidewall of a cap member <b>183</b> housing the needle <b>44</b>. These J-type slits <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> are opposed to each other and provide a guideway for the pins <b>174</b> and <b>176</b> which slide along these slits as the port structure <b>172</b> matingly engages the cap member <b>183</b>.</p>
    <p>To use this connector system <b>170</b>, the nurse aligns the port structure <b>172</b> with the open mouth <b>183</b> <i>a </i>of the cap member so that the pins <b>174</b> and <b>176</b> are in alignment with the entryway to the J-type slits <b>180</b> and <b>182</b>. Then the nurse pushes the port structure <b>172</b> into the open mouth <b>183</b> <i>a</i>, sliding the port structure into the cavity within the cap member <b>183</b>. The pins <b>174</b> and <b>176</b> first engage the entryway of the J-type slits <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> and then slide along the slits until they reach the base of the slits. At this point, the nurse twists or rotates the cap member <b>183</b> and port structure <b>172</b> in counter-rotating directions so that the pins <b>174</b> and <b>176</b> will then slide respectively into the hooks <b>180</b> <i>a </i>and <b>182</b> <i>a </i>of the slits and be secured. This embodiment does not provide an audible signal upon locking the cap member <b>183</b> to the port structure <b>172</b>, but is very economical to manufacture.</p>
    <heading>Function of the Cap Member and Port Structure</heading> <p>As will be appreciated from the above description, the cap member provides several functions in a single structure. (We will no longer refer by number to any one of the components of the invention since we are now discussing in general how the cap member and port structure function to provide the attributes of safety and convenience.) First, the cap member surrounds the needle and provides a housing in which the needle is lodged safely so that needle sticks are avoided. Second, because the needle is so lodged within the housing, if the nurse did, for example, lay the cap member on the patient's bed, the needle would not come into direct contact with the bedding which might be infested with harmful bacteria. Thus, this arrangement of the needle deep within the cavity in the cap member provides protection for the patient against bacterial contamination and protection for the nurse against accidental needle sticks.</p>
    <p>The port structure also provides more than one function. First, it serves as the site to attach the cap member, and, by means of a simple locking element such as a lip, thread, groove, pin or the like, provides an economical way to modify the conventional piggyback connector so that it may be used with the cap member. Second, the combination of a self-sealing seal and adjacent element that locks with the cap member provides a simple way to modify connectors so that they have enhanced safely and convenience.</p>
    <p>The cap member and port structure function in combination to direct the needle into the center of the seal, lock these pieces together, and enable quick connection. The nurse or patient simply aligns the sealed end of the port structure with the open mouth of the cap member and pushes the two pieces together. The internal wall of the cap member and the exterior wall of the port structure engage to align the two pieces so that their respective axes coincide, guiding the needle into the center of the seal as they are pushed together. Consequently, the needle does not scrape the inside wall of the port structure so that particles of plastic are not introduced into the patient's blood stream and the coring problem is virtually eliminated. The cap member and port structure each carry elements of a locking mechanism which engage and lock the pieces together when the needle has pierced the seal, preventing accidental disconnect. Although other geometric forms may be employed, quick connection is facilitated by the cylindrical configuration of the walls of the cap member and port structure and the circular open mouth of the cavity. In particular, the first through third embodiments of this invention are very quickly connected because no extra step is required to align the cap member and port structure. All that the nurse need do is insert the port structure into the open mouth without any special concern for their relative positions, and, when using the second and third embodiments, simply push these two pieces together until the locking mechanism engages. When using the first or fourth embodiments, the extra step of rotating the two pieces relative to each other is required to engage the locking mechanism. When using the forth embodiment, the pins must also first be aligned with the entryways to the J-slits prior to pushing the port structure into the cavity in the cap member.</p>
    <p>Because of the features embodied in the cap member and port structure, this invention may be used under normal hospital conditions without creating any additional work for the nurse, while substantially reducing the likelihood of harm to the patient due to carelessness and protecting the nurse against infection and making his or her job easier and faster.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY</heading> <p>In summary: Our connector is safe because (a) the needle is recessed deeply within the cap member and, therefore, is not likely to be contaminated by bacteria, (b) the cap member and port structure upon engagement guide the needle into the center of the seal, avoiding scraping particles from the inside wall of the port structure, (c) the cap member, housing the needle safely within it, protects the nurse against needle sticks, and (d) the locking of the cap member and port structure together prevents accidental disconnects and (e) the “click” signals the nurse when the connector system is locked securely in position. Our connector is convenient to use because (a) the walls of the cap member and port structure, interacting with each other, provide a guideway for quick connection, (b) the locking mechanism eliminates the burdensome and time consuming task of taping, and (c) the connector is very simple to use so that it is ideal for home care of patients.</p>
