    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading> <p num="p-0002">This invention relates to a Fischer-Tropsch synthesis process using microchannel technology, and a novel catalyst and microchannel reactor. The catalyst and reactor are useful in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis processes.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">The Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reaction involves converting a reactant composition comprising H<sub>2 </sub>and CO in the presence of a catalyst to aliphatic hydrocarbon products. The reactant composition may comprise the product stream from another reaction process such as steam reforming (product stream H<sub>2</sub>/CO˜3), partial oxidation (product stream H<sub>2</sub>/CO˜2), autothermal reforming (product stream H<sub>2</sub>/CO˜2.5), CO<sub>2 </sub>reforming (H<sub>2</sub>/CO˜1), coal gasification (product stream H<sub>2</sub>/CO˜1), and combinations thereof. The aliphatic hydrocarbon products may range from methane to paraffinic waxes of up to 100 carbon atoms or more.</p>
    <p num="p-0004">Conventional reactors such as tubular fixed bed reactors and slurry reactors have various problems in heat and mass transfer resulting in limitations of choice of process conditions for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reactions. Hot spots in the fixed bed reactors significantly promote methane formation, reduce the heavy hydrocarbon selectivity and deactivate the catalyst. On the other hand, strong mass transfer resistance inherent in a catalyst suspended in a slurry system generally reduces the effective reaction rate and also causes difficulty in separation of catalysts from the products. This invention provides a solution to these problems.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">This invention relates to a process for conducting a Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reaction in a microchannel reactor wherein the one-pass conversion of CO within the reactor is enhanced and the selectivity to methane is reduced. With the inventive process the tendency to form hot spots in the microchannel reactor is reduced. This reduction in the tendency to form hot spots is believed to be due, at least in part, to the fact that the microchannel reactor provides enhanced heat transfer characteristics and more precise control of temperatures and residence times as compared to prior art processes wherein microchannel reactors are not used. With this process, it is possible to obtain relatively high levels of conversion of the CO and high levels of selectivity to the desired product (e.g., hydrocarbons in the middle distillate range) as compared to such prior art. A novel catalyst as well as a novel microchannel reactor design are provided.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0006">This invention relates to a process for converting a reactant composition comprising H<sub>2 </sub>and CO to a product comprising at least one aliphatic hydrocarbon having at least about 5 carbon atoms, the process comprising: flowing the reactant composition through a microchannel reactor in contact with a Fischer-Tropsch catalyst to convert the reactant composition to the product, the microchannel reactor comprising a plurality of process microchannels containing the catalyst; transferring heat from the process microchannels to a heat exchanger; and removing the product from the microchannel reactor; the process producing at least about 0.5 gram of aliphatic hydrocarbon having at least about 5 carbon atoms per gram of catalyst per hour; the selectivity to methane in the product being less than about 25%.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">In one embodiment, the heat exchanger comprises a plurality of heat exchange channels adjacent to the process microchannels. In one embodiment, the heat exchange channels are microchannels.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">In one embodiment, the invention relates to a catalyst comprising Co supported on alumina, the loading of Co being at least about 25% by weight, the Co dispersion being at least about 3%. This catalyst may further comprise Re, Ru or a mixture thereof.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">In one embodiment, the invention relates to a catalyst, the catalyst comprising Co and a support, the catalyst being made by the steps of: (A) impregnating the support with a composition comprising Co to provide an intermediate catalytic product; (B) calcining the intermediate catalytic product formed in step (A); (C) impregnating the calcined intermediate product formed in step(B) with a composition comprising Co to provide another intermediate catalytic product; and (D) calcining the another intermediate catalytic product formed in step (C) to form the catalyst, the catalyst having a Co loading of at least about 25% by weight. The composition comprising Co used in step (A) may be the same as or it may be different than the composition comprising Co used in step (C). The support may comprise alumina.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">In one embodiment, the invention relates to a microchannel reactor, comprising: at least one process microchannel, the process microchannel having an entrance and an exit; and at least one heat exchange zone adjacent to the process microchannel, the heat exchange zone comprising a plurality of heat exchange channels, the heat exchange channels extending lengthwise at right angles relative to the lengthwise direction of the process microchannel; the heat exchange zone extending lengthwise in the same direction as the process microchannel and being positioned near the process microchannel entrance; the length of the heat exchange zone being less than the length of the process microchannel; the width of the process microchannel at or near the process microchannel exit being greater than the width of the process microchannel at or near the process microchannel entrance. In one embodiment, the at least one heat exchange zone comprises a first heat exchange zone and a second heat exchange zone, the length of the second heat exchange zone being less than the length of the first heat exchange zone.</p>

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0027">The term “microchannel” refers to a channel having at least one internal dimension of height or width of up to about 10 millimeters (mm), and in one embodiment up to about 5 mm, and in one embodiment up to about 2 mm, and in one embodiment up to about 1 mm. The flow of fluid through the microchannel may proceed along the length of the microchannel normal to the height and width of the microchannel. An example of a microchannel that may be used with the inventive process as a process microchannel and/or a heat exchange microchannel is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The microchannel <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has a height (h), width (w) and length (l). Fluid flows through the microchannel <b>10</b> along the length of the microchannel in the direction indicated by arrows <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. The height (h) or width (w) of the microchannel may be in the range of about 0.05 to about 10 mm, and in one embodiment about 0.05 to about 5 mm, and in one embodiment about 0.05 to about 2 mm, and in one embodiment about 0.05 to about 1.5 mm, and in one embodiment about 0.05 to about 1 mm, and in one embodiment about 0.05 to about 0.75 mm, and in one embodiment about 0.05 to about 0.5 mm. The other dimension of height or width may be of any dimension, for example, up to about 3 meters, and in one embodiment about 0.01 to about 3 meters, and in one embodiment about 0.1 to about 3 meters. The length (l) of the microchannel may be of any dimension, for example, up to about 10 meters, and in one embodiment about 0.2 to about 10 meters, and in one embodiment from about 0.2 to about 6 meters, and in one embodiment from 0.2 to about 3 meters. Although the microchannel <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has a cross section that is rectangular, it is to be understood that the microchannel may have a cross section having any shape, for example, a square, circle, semi-circle, trapezoid, etc. The shape and/or size of the cross section of the microchannel may vary over its length. For example, the height or width may taper from a relatively large dimension to a relatively small dimension, or vice versa, over the length of the microchannel.</p>
    <p num="p-0028">The term “adjacent” when referring to the position of one channel relative to the position of another channel means directly adjacent such that a wall separates the two channels. This wall may vary in thickness. However, “adjacent” channels are not separated by an intervening channel that would interfere with heat transfer between the channels. In one embodiment, one channel may be adjacent to another channel over only part of the dimension of the another channel. For example, a process microchannel may be longer than and extend beyond one or more adjacent heat exchange channels.</p>
    <p num="p-0029">The term “fluid” refers to a gas, a liquid, or a gas or a liquid containing dispersed solids or liquid droplets.</p>
    <p num="p-0030">The term “contact time” refers to the volume of the reaction zone within the microchannel reactor divided by the volumetric feed flow rate of the reactant composition at a temperature of ° C. and a pressure of one atmosphere.</p>
    <p num="p-0031">The term “residence time” refers to the internal volume of a space (e.g., the reaction zone within a microchannel reactor) occupied by a fluid flowing through the space divided by the average volumetric flowrate for the fluid flowing through the space at the temperature and pressure being used.</p>
    <p num="p-0032">The term “reaction zone” refers to the space within the process microchannels wherein the reactants contact the catalyst.</p>
    <p num="p-0033">The term “conversion of CO” refers to the CO mole change between the reactant composition and product divided by the moles of CO in the reactant composition.</p>
    <p num="p-0034">The term “selectivity to methane” refers to the moles of methane in the product divided by the moles of methane plus two times the number of moles of C<sub>2 </sub>hydrocarbons in the product, plus three times the number of moles of C<sub>3 </sub>hydrocarbons in the product, plus four times the number of moles of C<sub>4 </sub>hydrocarbons in the product, etc., until all of the moles of hydrocarbons in the product have been included.</p>
    <p num="p-0035">The term “one-pass conversion of CO” refers to the conversion of CO after one pass through the microchannel reactor employed with the inventive process.</p>
    <p num="p-0036">The term “yield of product” refers to conversion of CO multiplied by selectivity to the indicated product(s).</p>
    <p num="p-0037">The term “metal dispersion” refers to the percent of catalytically active metal atoms and promoter atoms on the surface of the catalyst as compared to the total number of metal atoms in the catalyst as measured by hydrogen chemisorption which is described in “Heterogeneous Catalysis in Industrial Practice,” 2<sup>nd </sup>ed., Charles N. Satterfield, p. 139, McGraw Hill (1996), which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <p num="p-0038">In the expression “about 0.5 gram of aliphatic hydrocarbon having at least about 5 carbon atoms per gram of catalyst per hour” the weight or number of grams of catalyst refers to the total weight of the catalyst consisting of the catalytic metal (e.g., Co) or oxide thereof, optional co-catalyst (e.g., Re or Ru), and/or promoter (e.g., Na, K, etc.) as well as the weight of any support (e.g., alumina). However, if the catalyst is supported on an engineered support structure such as a foam, felt, wad or fin, the weight of such engineered support structure is not included in the calculation of the weight or number of grams of catalyst. Similarly, if the catalyst is adhered to the microchannel walls, the weight of the microchannel walls is not included in the calculation.</p>
    <p num="p-0039">The term “Co loading” refers to the weight of the Co in the catalyst divided by the total weight of the catalyst, that is, the total weight of the Co plus any co-catalyst or promoter as well as the support. If the catalyst is supported on an engineered support structure such as a foam, felt, wad or fin, the weight of such engineered support structure is not included in the calculation. Similarly, if the catalyst is adhered to the microchannel walls, the weight of the microchannel walls is not included in the calculation.</p>
    <p num="p-0040">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the process may be conducted using microchannel reactor <b>100</b> which includes microchannel reactor core <b>102</b>, reactant header <b>104</b>, product footer <b>106</b>, heat exchange header <b>108</b> and heat exchange footer <b>110</b>. The microchannel reactor core <b>102</b> contains a plurality of process microchannels and a plurality of heat exchange channels adjacent to the process microchannels. The heat exchange channels may be microchannels. The process microchannels and heat exchange channels may be aligned in layers, one above the other, or side by side. A Fischer-Tropsch catalyst is contained within the process microchannels. The process header <b>104</b> provides a passageway for fluid to flow into the process microchannels with an even or substantially even distribution of flow to the process microchannels. The process footer <b>106</b> provides a passageway for fluid to flow from the process microchannels in a rapid manner with a relatively high rate of flow. The reactant composition flows into the microchannel reactor <b>100</b> through the reactant header <b>104</b>, as indicated by directional arrow <b>112</b>. The reactant composition may be preheated prior to entering the reactant header <b>104</b>. The reactant composition flows through the process microchannels in the microchannel reactor core <b>102</b> in contact with the catalyst and reacts to form the desired product. In one embodiment, the flow of reactant composition and product through the reactor core <b>102</b> is in a vertical direction, from the top of the reactor core <b>102</b> to its bottom. The product, and in one embodiment unreacted components from the reactant composition, flow from the reactor core <b>102</b> through the product footer <b>106</b>, and out of product footer <b>106</b>, as indicated by directional arrow <b>114</b>. Although an advantage of the inventive process is that a high level of conversion of CO may be obtained with one pass through the process microchannels, in one embodiment, unreacted components from the reactant composition or a portion thereof may be recycled back through the process microchannels in contact with the catalyst. The unreacted components of the reactant composition being recycled through the process microchannels may be recycled any number of times, for example, one, two, three, four times, etc. A heat exchange fluid flows into heat exchange header <b>108</b>, as indicated by directional arrow <b>116</b>, and from heat exchange header <b>108</b> through the heat exchange channels in microchannel reactor core <b>102</b> to heat exchange footer <b>110</b>, and out of heat exchange footer <b>110</b>, as indicated by directional arrow <b>118</b>.

The median particle diameter may be in the range of about 1 to about 1000 μm, and in one embodiment about 10 to about 500 μm, and the length of each process microchannel may be in the range of up to about 500 cm, and in one embodiment about 10 to about 500 cm, and in one embodiment about 50 to about 300 cm.</p>
    <p num="p-0066">The catalyst may be supported on a porous support structure such as a foam, felt, wad or a combination thereof. The term “foam” is used herein to refer to a structure with continuous walls defining pores throughout the structure. The term “felt” is used herein to refer to a structure of fibers with interstitial spaces therebetween. The term “wad” is used herein to refer to a structure of tangled strands, like steel wool. The catalyst may be supported on a honeycomb structure.</p>
    <p num="p-0067">The catalyst may be supported on a flow-by support structure such as a felt with an adjacent gap, a foam with an adjacent gap, a fin structure with gaps, a washcoat on any inserted substrate, or a gauze that is parallel to the flow direction with a corresponding gap for flow. An example of a flow-by structure is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the catalyst <b>300</b> is contained within process microchannel <b>302</b>. An open passage way <b>304</b> permits the flow of fluid through the process microchannel <b>302</b> in contact with the catalyst <b>300</b> as indicated by arrows <b>306</b> and <b>308</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0068">The catalyst may be supported on a flow-through support structure such as a foam, wad, pellet, powder, or gauze. An example of a flow-through structure is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the flow-through catalyst <b>310</b> is contained within process microchannel <b>312</b> and the fluid flows through the catalyst <b>310</b> as indicated by arrows <b>314</b> and <b>316</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0069">The support structure for a flow-through catalyst may be formed from a material comprising silica gel, foamed copper, sintered stainless steel fiber, steel wool, alumina, poly(methyl methacrylate), polysulfonate, poly(tetrafluoroethylene), iron, nickel sponge, nylon, polyvinylidene difluoride, polypropylene, polyethylene, polyethylene ethylketone, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetate, polyacrylate, polymethylmethacrylate, polystyrene, polyphenylene sulfide, polysulfone, polybutylene, or a combination of two or more thereof. In one embodiment, the support structure may be made of a heat conducting material, such as a metal, to enhance the transfer of heat away from the catalyst.</p>
    <p num="p-0070">The catalyst may be directly washcoated on the interior walls of the process microchannels, grown on the walls from solution, or coated in situ on a fin structure. The catalyst may be in the form of a single piece of porous contiguous material, or many pieces in physical contact. In one embodiment, the catalyst may be comprised of a contiguous material and has a contiguous porosity such that molecules can diffuse through the catalyst. In this embodiment, the fluids flow through the catalyst rather than around it. In one embodiment, the cross-sectional area of the catalyst occupies about 1 to about 99%, and in one embodiment about 10 to about 95% of the cross-sectional area of the process microchannels. The catalyst may have a surface area, as measured by BET, of greater than about 0.5 m<sup>2</sup>/g, and in one embodiment greater than about 2 m<sup>2</sup>/g.</p>
    <p num="p-0071">The catalyst may comprise a porous support, an interfacial layer on the porous support, and a catalyst material on the interfacial layer. The interfacial layer may be solution deposited on the support or it may be deposited by chemical vapor deposition or physical vapor deposition. In one embodiment the catalyst has a porous support, a buffer layer, an interfacial layer, and a catalyst material. Any of the foregoing layers may be continuous or discontinuous as in the form of spots or dots, or in the form of a layer with gaps or holes.</p>
    <p num="p-0072">The porous support may have a porosity of at least about 5% as measured by mercury porosimetry and an average pore size (sum of pore diameters divided by number of pores) of about 1 to about 1000 μm. The porous support may be a porous ceramic or a metal foam. Other porous supports that may be used include carbides, nitrides, and composite materials. The porous support may have a porosity of about 30% to about 99%, and in one embodiment about 60% to about 98%. The porous support may be in the form of a foam, felt, wad, or a combination thereof. The open cells of the metal foam may range from about 20 pores per inch (ppi) to about 3000 ppi, and in one embodiment about 20 to about 1000 ppi, and in one embodiment about 40 to about 120 ppi. The term “ppi” refers to the largest number of pores per inch (in isotropic materials the direction of the measurement is irrelevant; however, in anisotropic materials, the measurement is done in the direction that maximizes pore number).</p>
    <p num="p-0073">The buffer layer, when present, may have a different composition and/or density than both the porous support and the interfacial layers, and in one embodiment has a coefficient of thermal expansion that is intermediate the thermal expansion coefficients of the porous support and the interfacial layer. The buffer layer may be a metal oxide or metal carbide. The buffer layer may be comprised of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, or combination thereof. The Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>may be α-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, γ-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>or a combination thereof. α-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>provides the advantage of excellent resistance to oxygen diffusion. The buffer layer may be formed of two or more compositionally different sublayers. For example, when the porous support is metal, for example a stainless steel foam, a buffer layer formed of two compositionally different sub-layers may be used. The first sublayer (in contact with the porous support) may be TiO<sub>2</sub>. The second sublayer may be α-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>which is placed upon the TiO<sub>2</sub>. In one embodiment, the α-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>sublayer is a dense layer that provides protection of the underlying metal surface. A less dense, high surface area interfacial layer such as alumina may then be deposited as support for a catalytically active layer.</p>
    <p num="p-0074">The porous support may have a thermal coefficient of expansion different from that of the interfacial layer. In such a case a buffer layer may be needed to transition between the two coefficients of thermal expansion. The thermal expansion coefficient of the buffer layer can be tailored by controlling its composition to obtain an expansion coefficient that is compatible with the expansion coefficients of the porous support and interfacial layers. The buffer layer should be free of openings and pin holes to provide superior protection of the underlying support. The buffer layer may be nonporous. The buffer layer may have a thickness that is less than one half of the average pore size of the porous support. The buffer layer may have a thickness of about 0.05 to about 10 μm, and in one embodiment about 0.05 to about 5 μm.</p>
    <p num="p-0075">In one embodiment of the invention, adequate adhesion and chemical stability may be obtained without a buffer layer. In this embodiment the buffer layer may be omitted.</p>
    <p num="p-0076">The interfacial layer may comprise nitrides, carbides, sulfides, halides, metal oxides, carbon, or a combination thereof. The interfacial layer provides high surface area and/or provides a desirable catalyst-support interaction for supported catalysts. The interfacial layer may be comprised of any material that is conventionally used as a catalyst support. The interfacial layer may be comprised of a metal oxide. Examples of metal oxides that may be used include γ-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, tungsten oxide, magnesium oxide, vanadium oxide, chromium oxide, manganese oxide, iron oxide, nickel oxide, cobalt oxide, copper oxide, zinc oxide, molybdenum oxide, tin oxide, calcium oxide, aluminum oxide, lanthanum series oxide(s), zeolite(s) and combinations thereof. The interfacial layer may serve as a catalytically active layer without any further catalytically active material deposited thereon. Usually, however, the interfacial layer is used in combination with a catalytically active layer. The interfacial layer may also be formed of two or more compositionally different sublayers. The interfacial layer may have a thickness that is less than one half of the average pore size of the porous support. The interfacial layer thickness may range from about 0.5 to about 100 μm, and in one embodiment from about 1 to about 50 μm. The interfacial layer may be either crystalline or amorphous. The interfacial layer may have a BET surface area of at least about 1 m<sup>2</sup>/g.</p>
    <p num="p-0077">The catalyst may be deposited on the interfacial layer. Alternatively, the catalyst material may be simultaneously deposited with the interfacial layer. The catalyst layer may be intimately dispersed on the interfacial layer. That the catalyst layer is“dispersed on” or “deposited on” the interfacial layer includes the conventional understanding that microscopic catalyst particles are dispersed: on the support layer (i.e., interfacial layer) surface, in crevices in the support layer, and in open pores in the support layer.</p>

The process microchannel has a height of 0.51 mm, a width of 0.7 cm, and a length of 5.1 cm. The process microchannel contains 0.2 gram of a Co/Re catalyst which is supported on Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The Co/Re molar ratio is 21. The catalyst is prepared using a multi-impregnation method to achieve a 30% by weight loading of Co, and a 4.5% by weight loading of Re. The metal dispersion in the catalyst is 5.4%. The catalyst is in the form of particulate solids having a particle size in the range of 177–250 microns. The solids are packed in the process microchannel. The process microchannel is cooled with an adjacent heat exchanger to the extent that the temperature gradient within the catalyst is less than 5° C.</p>
