    <p>This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/267,018, filed Feb. 7, 2001, titled “Lighted Patio Umbrella Apparatus;” and of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/335,933, filed Nov. 2, 2001, titled “Outdoor Lighting Systems with Cold Cathode Tubes.”</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>The present invention relates in general to patio umbrellas, and in particular, to an improved patio umbrella with integral lighting system and other modular electronic systems and components.</p>
    <p>2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p>There has been a recent increase in the interest in entertaining in a lawn and garden environment. Patio furniture is quite popular and useful for outdoor entertaining, especially in portions of the country that have warmer climates. However, the sun often presents an impediment to such outdoor entertaining. Consequently, sales have increased for relatively large patio and table umbrellas for use in shielding or shading table areas and people sitting around the tables from direct exposure to the sunlight. Given the relatively high degree of interest in patio umbrellas, it is likely that improved umbrellas, or umbrellas with enhanced functions, will be well received in the marketplace.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>It is one objective of the present invention to provide a lawn or patio umbrella with an integral lighting system that utilizes cold cathode tubes, light emitting diodes (LED's), or florescent lights, to provide relatively bright outdoor light for reading and other activities that require relatively high light intensities.</p>
    <p>It is another objective of the present invention to provide an a lawn or patio umbrella with an integral lighting system that utilizes cold cathode tubes, LED's, or florescent lights, to provide relatively bright outdoor light, and its own rechargeable power supply, including solar cells.</p>
    <p>It is yet another objective of the present invention to provide a lawn or patio umbrella with an integral lighting system that utilizes cold cathode tubes, LED's, or florescent lights, to provide relatively bright outdoor light, and a motorized retraction system that aids in opening and closing the umbrella.</p>
    <p>It is yet another objective of the present invention to provide a lawn or patio umbrella with an integral lighting system that utilizes cold cathode tubes, LED's, or florescent lights, to provide relatively bright outdoor light, and a cooling system, such as one that utilizes electric fans or misting systems.</p>
    <p>It is yet another objective of the present invention to provide a modular, electrically powered lawn or patio umbrella in which lighting systems, such as those utilizing cold cathode tubes, LED's, or florescent lights; cooling systems, such as those utilizing electric fans or misting systems; and motorized retraction systems; can be selectively interchanged.</p>
    <p>The above objects are achieved, for example, by integrating a rechargeable power system, a lighting system, a motorized retraction system, and/or a cooling system into a relatively large patio umbrella. The resulting umbrella does not have to be connected to a household electrical system, is a relatively low power consuming device, does not generate much heat, provides a high amount of light intensity, reduces the overall energy consumption of outdoor lighting, allows for fewer batteries to be utilized in each lighting fixture, allows for easier recharging of the batteries due to the lower power requirements, and allows the utilization of smaller photovoltaic solar cells.</p>
    <p>In the embodiment that utilizes a cold cathode tube, one additional advantage is that the cold cathode tube may be operated at multiple voltage levels to provide differing amounts of light output. In one particular embodiment, a wireless receiver and transmitter pair may be utilized to allow an operator to use a wireless command signal to change the operating state of the lighting system, such as switching the system between an on and off condition, and switching the system between varying levels of light output. Accordingly, an operator may intensify the light output from the lighting system through use of a wireless handheld transmitter when he wants additional light from a particular umbrella.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Referring to FIG. 1 in the drawings, one embodiment of an umbrella apparatus according to the present invention is illustrated. Umbrella apparatus <b>11</b> includes an umbrella portion <b>13</b> and a hollow tubular pole portion <b>15</b>. Pole portion <b>15</b> is coupled to and supports umbrella portion <b>13</b>. Umbrella portion <b>13</b> is preferably retractable and may be moved between a raised, or expanded open position, which is shown; and a lowered, or retracted, closed position in which umbrella portion is collapsed down about pole portion <b>15</b>, as is conventional. A flexible canopy <b>17</b> is attached to and covers umbrella portion <b>15</b>. Canopy <b>17</b> is supported by a plurality of rib members <b>19</b>, <b>21</b>, <b>23</b>, and <b>25</b>. Rib members <b>19</b>, <b>21</b>, <b>23</b>, and <b>25</b> are preferably hingedly coupled to pole portion <b>15</b> at an upper portion of pole portion <b>15</b>. An integral lighting system <b>26</b> is carried by at least one of rib members <b>19</b>, <b>21</b>, <b>23</b>, or <b>25</b>. Lighting system <b>26</b> provides high intensity light to umbrella apparatus <b>11</b> and the surrounding area. In the embodiment of FIG. 1, lighting system <b>26</b> preferably utilizes a cold cathode tube which will be described in greater detail herein.</p>
    <p>Umbrella apparatus <b>11</b> may include a base member adapted to receive pole portion <b>15</b> and to support umbrella apparatus <b>11</b> in a generally upright position. Although not shown in the embodiment FIG. 1, other embodiments of the present invention depict a variety of conventional and novel base members, any of which may be utilized with the embodiment of FIG. <b>1</b>. It should be understood that in all of the embodiments of the present invention discussed herein, umbrella apparatus <b>11</b> may be used with little or no base member whatsoever, provided there is a table or some other support structure, including the ground, which may be adapted to receive pole portion <b>15</b>. For example, many patio tables are designed with central apertures to receive, support, and stabilize relatively large umbrellas. In some cases, the patio tables eliminate the need for a base member all together.</p>
    <p>In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention, light system <b>26</b> includes a plurality of light strands <b>27</b>, <b>29</b>, <b>31</b>, and <b>33</b> attached to rib members <b>19</b>, <b>21</b>, <b>23</b>, and <b>25</b>. Each light strand <b>27</b>, <b>29</b>, <b>31</b>, and <b>33</b> includes electrical wiring <b>39</b> which conductively connects a plurality of small cold cathode tube light bulbs together for providing the high intensity light under canopy <b>17</b> and in the area surrounding umbrella apparatus <b>11</b>. A wiring ring <b>37</b> secures and locates electrical wiring <b>39</b> of light strands <b>27</b>, <b>29</b>, <b>31</b>, and <b>33</b>, so that electrical wiring <b>39</b> may be passed through the hollow interior of pole portion <b>15</b> to a power source, as will be described in detail below.</p>
    <p>Umbrella apparatus <b>11</b> includes an optional opening and closing system <b>40</b> that aids in expanding umbrella portion <b>13</b> into the open condition and retracting umbrella portion <b>13</b> into the closed condition. Opening and closing system <b>40</b> includes a cable system <b>41</b>, a gear and pulley system <b>43</b> housed in a crank case <b>44</b>, and a manual crank <b>45</b>. Crank case <b>44</b> is preferably located on pole portion <b>15</b> such that crank case <b>44</b> is accessible when umbrella portion <b>13</b> is in the fully retracted position against pole portion <b>15</b>. Cable system <b>41</b> is coupled between rib members <b>19</b>, <b>21</b>, <b>23</b>, and <b>25</b> and gear and pulley system <b>43</b>, and is preferably disposed within the hollow interior of pole portion <b>15</b>. Manual crank <b>45</b> is coupled to gear and pulley system <b>43</b> so as to allow manual opening and closing of umbrella portion <b>13</b>.</p>
    <p>Opening and closing system <b>40</b> may be automated by the inclusion of an electric screw driver motor <b>49</b>, or other similar relatively small diameter motor assembly, and one or more operational switches <b>47</b>. Motor <b>49</b> is preferably disposed within the hollow interior of pole portion <b>15</b> and is coupled to gear and pulley system <b>43</b>. Operational switches <b>47</b> are preferably carried by crank case <b>44</b>, and include one or more switches for controlling the operation of motor <b>49</b>. With the inclusion of motor <b>49</b>, a user may expand and retract umbrella portion <b>13</b> simply by pressing the appropriate operational switch <b>47</b>. This feature is particularly advantageous when used with large umbrellas which may be relatively heavy and awkward to operate, or when the user lacks sufficient strength to expand or retract umbrella portion <b>13</b>.</p>
    <p>Umbrella apparatus <b>11</b> includes a power system <b>50</b> having a power source <b>55</b>. In this embodiment, power source <b>55</b> is preferably disposed in the hollow interior of pole portion <b>15</b> at a lower extremity and comprises one or more rechargeable batteries <b>55</b> <i>a</i>. A releasable end cap <b>57</b> having integral ground connectors is provided at the lowermost portion of pole portion <b>15</b> to complete the electrical circuit of power system <b>50</b> and to allow access to rechargeable batteries <b>55</b> <i>a</i>, as rechargeable batteries <b>55</b> <i>a </i>may have to be periodically replaced. Power system <b>50</b> provides electrical power to lighting system <b>26</b> and opening and closing system <b>40</b>. An external power system charger <b>51</b> is electrically coupled to power system <b>50</b> to aid in repeatedly charging rechargeable batteries <b>55</b> <i>a</i>. As is shown in FIG. 1, an external adapter <b>60</b> may be provided. External adapter <b>60</b> includes a relatively small plug <b>59</b> that is adapted to be conductively received by external power system charger <b>51</b>, an extension cord <b>61</b>, an electrical transformer <b>63</b>, and terminals <b>65</b> that allow transformer <b>63</b> to be plugged into a conventional AC wall outlet. This allows power system charger <b>51</b> to receive power directly from a conventional AC wall outlet in order to recharge rechargeable batteries <b>55</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p>In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, an alternative power system charger <b>62</b> may be provided. Alternate power system charger <b>62</b> includes at least one solar cell <b>35</b> carried by an upper cap portion <b>64</b>. Solar cells <b>35</b> are conductively coupled to power system charger <b>51</b> via wires (not shown) that pass through the hollow interior of pole portion <b>15</b>, thereby allowing solar cells <b>35</b> to provide an electrical charge to recharge rechargeable batteries <b>55</b> <i>a</i>, provided sunlight falls upon solar cells <b>35</b>. Because solar cells <b>35</b> provide continuous recharging throughout the daylight hours, the amount and frequency of charging power system <b>50</b> with external power system charger <b>60</b> may be minimized. It is important to note that locating alternate power system charger <b>62</b> atop umbrella portion <b>13</b> is unique and. advantageous, particularly when alternate power system charger <b>62</b> includes solar cells <b>35</b> or other types of solar energy collectors. Such location limits the visibility of alternate power system charger <b>62</b> and ensures that solar energy collection is maximized.</p>
    <p>The embodiment depicted in FIG. 1 is advantageous over the prior art in that it provides a number of useful functions. Umbrella apparatus <b>11</b> is lighted by lighting system <b>26</b> which does not require continuous access to a conventional AC wall outlet, while providing high intensity light. This allows umbrella apparatus <b>11</b> to be placed in a relatively remote lawn or garden locations that are away from, or substantially removed from, conventional AC power outlets. During daylight hours, solar cells <b>35</b> provide a continuous trickle charge to recharge rechargeable batteries <b>55</b> <i>a</i>, thereby reducing the need for and frequency of use of external power system charger <b>60</b>. However, when an electrical charge is needed, external power system charger <b>60</b> may be utilized to directly charge power system charger <b>51</b>. Of course, a conventional extension cord may be used, thereby eliminating the need to move umbrella apparatus <b>11</b> from its remote location to a location near an AC power outlet.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIGS. 2A-2C in the drawings, another embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. In this embodiment, an umbrella apparatus <b>111</b> includes an umbrella portion <b>113</b>, a pole portion <b>115</b>, a stand portion <b>118</b>, and a base portion <b>120</b> adapted to house a rechargeable power system <b>151</b>.

    <p>Although FIGS. 6-9 depict power units with a single electrical system, it should be understood that in alternative embodiments, one could mix and match these electrical subassemblies such that a single power unit provides electrical power to two or more subassemblies. For example, an umbrella apparatus may include a lighting system and either one or both of the cooling systems described above. Alternatively, an umbrella apparatus may include a lighting system, a cooling system, and an automated opening and closing system as described herein. In this manner, the umbrella apparatus of the present invention is modular such that the different subsystems can be easily mixed and matched.</p>
    <p>This modularity allows one to manufacture and sell aftermarket kits which can be installed and interchanged by the umbrella owners. Such kits may include a power unit and one or more of the subsystems, such as a lighting system and/or a cooling system and/or an automated opening and closing system. Because the power unit is relatively self-contained, little interaction is required to attach the power unit to an umbrella apparatus. Alternatively, this modularity in design facilitates the mass manufacture of umbrellas, allowing the electrical system to be manufactured by one factory, and the umbrella systems, which do not include electrical systems, to be manufactured by a different factory. The parts can then be brought together in an assembly area and assembled together.</p>

    <p>Referring now to FIG. 10 in the drawings, a schematic of the cold cathode tube lighting system of the present invention is illustrated. The invention is to utilize in combination a cold cathode lamp, a power inverter which supplies alternating current to the cold cathode lamp, a rechargeable DC battery pack, and a solar collector. This is depicted in simplified form in FIG. <b>10</b>. This may be utilized in any outdoor application in which there is no easy or convenient access to household power. The system is entirely self contained and does not require any household power for operation, or charging. As is shown, the cold cathode tube lighting system <b>3000</b> includes a cold cathode lamp <b>3001</b> that is supplied with AC power from a power inverter <b>3007</b>. A DC battery pack <b>3003</b> includes rechargeable batteries that supply DC current to power inverter <b>3007</b>. A solar collector <b>3005</b> is provided to recharge the batteries contained within DC power pack <b>3003</b>.</p>
    <p>A cold cathode tube is a lamp that produces light by the passage of an electric current through a vapor or gas maintained within a tube. A cold cathode tube does not require any heating above ambient temperature to produce light. The tube is phosphor coated on its inner surface, and thus may emit various colored light. In most cases, cold cathode tube lamps are low-pressure mercury vapor lamps. Such lamps use a 253.7 nanometer ultraviolet emission from mercury vapor excited by an electrical discharge through the lamp to charge the phosphors maintained on the wall of the lamp.</p>
    <p>The optimum operating temperature for cold cathode tube is approximately 40 degrees Celsius, although Applicant believes that these lamps can be produced in a manner to reliably provide outdoor lighting in temperatures as cold as 15 degrees Fahrenheit. While the cold cathode tube does not require heating, the output of the lamp does vary based upon the ambient temperature. At room temperature, the initial output of a lamp is only about seventy percent of its steady state value at 40 degrees Celsius. In contrast, its output is only 25 percent when the lamp is started at zero degrees Celsius. Cold starts do require additional voltage from the power source to ensure reliable operation. However, the number of lamp “starts” has no adverse effect on the lamp. This is not true for fluorescent lamps, which degrade over time due to the number of “starts.” Cold cathode tubes may be utilized to supply a white light output.</p>
    <p>In the preferred embodiment, a cold cathode tube manufactured by Nanjing Lampus Electronics Company, Ltd. is utilized. Specifically, a lamp type CFL-20 is utilized. This has an inner diameter of 1.5 millimeters. The tube length is variable, and may be anywhere in the range of 50 millimeters to 30 millimeters in overall length. The tube is adapted to operate on four milliamps of tube current. The tube voltage is in the range of 200 to 750 Volts. The average brightness of this particular tube is 40,000 cd/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
    <p>Another advantage of cold cathode tubes is that the tubes can be very thin in diameter. For example, in the preferred implementation, the cold cathode tube may be one or two millimeters in diameter. A cold cathode tube can be bent into any shape and can be formed in very long lengths, such as several feet long. Thus, cold cathode tubes provide greater light output per foot versus conventional lighting.</p>
    <p>Another significant advantage of cold cathode tubes it that they have relatively long lamp life. It is not unusual to have lamp lives which are thirty to forty thousand hours of use. In other words, these cold cathode tubes have, for all practical purposes, an infinite life span.</p>
    <p>They are low power devices. They do not generate a lot of heat. They provide high lumen output. For these reasons, fewer batteries are needed to drive the cold cathode ray tube, and smaller solar cell panels may be utilized to recharge the batteries. In other words, relatively small form factors can be achieved because the solar cells, the batteries, and the bulbs can be relatively small in size.</p>
    <p>The present invention can be implemented on a small, medium, or large scale so the solar cell panels and batteries may be moved up in size to either provide greater light output or to provide for a longer useful life.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the present invention may be considered to satisfy three separate and distinct outdoor lighting applications, all of which may be incorporated into the umbrella apparatus of the present invention.</p>
    <p>The first application is that of a “special purpose light,” or “ask light,” such as for security applications. These special purpose lights would provide very light output, for a relatively short duration. One example would be the utilization of the cold cathode ray tube to provide extremely high light output for a very small area for a very short time, all in response to detection of motion in a particular area. For example, a system can be configured to detect motion in a doorway, motion in a yard, motion in a driveway, or the like. The brightness can be provided which can be far in excess of 40,000 cd/m<sup>2</sup>. For example, 100,000 to 200,000 cd/ m<sup>2 </sup>may be provided for a very small area for a very short duration. For example, the duration may be a few minutes to ten minutes.</p>
    <p>The second application requires a medium amount of light output, but requires longer periods of operation or wider areas of coverage. For example, the light assembly provided with the umbrella provides a relatively high light output, such as in the range of 20,000 to 100,000 cd/m<sup>2</sup>, in order to allow one to read, play games, operate a computer, or do needlework under the umbrella. Preferably, the battery pack and associated solar panel is sufficient to allow the system to operate continuously for a time interval in the range of 8-12 hours. Additionally, and preferably, the solar panel should be of the size and output which is sufficient to fully recharge the battery pack during the daylight hours.</p>
    <p>A third application requires a lower level of light intensity. A good example would be lawn, patio, walkway, or landscape lighting. One does not ordinarily expect to be able to read or do intricate work under this type of lighting. In contrast, all that is expected is that a reasonable amount of light be provided to allow one to walk safely through an area. This type of task may require brightness in the range of 6,000 cd/m<sup>2 </sup>to 60,000 cd/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 11 in the drawings, a block diagram representation of the application of the present invention to a lawn lighting scenario is illustrated. In this scenario, a plurality of solar panels <b>4001</b>, <b>4003</b>, <b>4005</b>, and <b>4007</b> are connected together in series. Preferably, solar panels <b>4001</b>, <b>4003</b>, <b>4005</b>, and <b>4007</b> are manufactured by Siemens and comprise mono-crystal solar panels, each providing 1.5 Volts. The total current for the array of solar panels is about 80 milliamps. The current from solar panels <b>4001</b>, <b>4003</b>, <b>4005</b>, and <b>4007</b> is passed through a diode <b>4009</b> and then to a battery pack <b>4011</b>. Battery pack <b>4011</b> includes a plurality of batteries <b>4013</b>, <b>4015</b>, and <b>4017</b>, for example three AA batteries. In alternative embodiments, as few as two batteries may be used. As is shown, each battery is a 1.2 Volt Nickel Cadmium battery. They collectively provide 700 milliamp hours of power.</p>
    <p>The output of DC battery pack <b>4011</b> is provided as an input to an inverter <b>4019</b>. Inverter <b>4019</b> receives 4.8 Volts DC in and produces as an output of 800 Volts rms AC at 40 Hertz. The total current of the output is 4-6 milliamps.</p>
    <p>This is provided to the cathode of a cold cathode ray tube lamp <b>4021</b>. The current passes through the vapor maintained within cold cathode ray tube lamp <b>4021</b> and causes electrons to be stripped from the gas. These electrons collide with the phosphorus coating on the interior surface of cold cathode ray tube lamp <b>4021</b>, thereby emitting light.</p>
    <p>Although the invention has been described with reference to a particular embodiment, this description is not meant to be construed in a limiting sense. Various modifications of the disclosed embodiments as well as alternative embodiments of the invention will become apparent to persons skilled in the art upon reference to the description of the invention. It is therefore contemplated that the appended claims will cover any such modifications or embodiments that fall within the scope of the invention.</p>
