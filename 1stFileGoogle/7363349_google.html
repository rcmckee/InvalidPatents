The gateway server is communicatively connected to the access client through a network. The gateway server provides a presentation service (PS) and a real-time service (RTS), which cooperate with the access client to retrieve data from a data store and then provide the retrieved data to a user's remote communication device. More particularly, when a user wishes to retrieve data from the data store or to send data to the data store, the user establishes a communication connection between his or her remote communication device and the gateway server, and then requests the desired data from the gateway server. In response, the gateway server sends a command to the access client, instructing it to retrieve the requested data. The access client retrieves the requested data from the data store, and returns the retrieved data to the gateway server. The gateway server then relays the requested information back to the user's remote communication device.</div>

    <p num="p-0002">This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. § 119 to provisional U.S. Application Ser. No. 60/444,213, filed Jan. 31, 2003, entitled “Asynchronous Real-Time Retrieval Of Data,” which application is incorporated entirely herein by reference.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">The present invention relates to the asynchronous real-time retrieval of data. Various aspects of the present invention are particularly applicable to the asynchronous real-time retrieval of data from a corporate database to a remote device, such as a wireless telephone or personal digital assistant.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0004">Recently, digital information has become more and more important to people of all walks of life. As the importance of digital information has increased, the need for convenient remote access to a variety of types of digital information has increased as well. For example, traveling businessmen may desire continual access to information contained in electronic spreadsheets, attorneys may desire access to word processing documents from a client's location, and students may want to send or retrieve electronic mail while in school.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">In order to address this need, many communication service providers allow their customers to access remote digital information through a communication network. For example, a wireless telephone service provider may allow its customers to use their wireless telephones or other communication devices to send and receive retrieve electronic mail, retrieve image information from a network, obtain contact information from a centralized database, or the like. Similarly, some companies have established remote high-speed Internet connections, both wired and wireless, at public locations such as restaurants, hotels, and airports, which can be accessed by a customer's computer.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">While communication service providers have created an infrastructure that potentially allows their customers remote access to digital information, many practical issues still prevent this infrastructure from being fully utilized. For example, some customers seek to access digital information stored behind a barrier, such as digital information stored in their employer's database and protected by a firewall. With this arrangement, if the employer's network did not support an access tool allowing external connections through the firewall then a customer would be prevented from accessing the desired digital information through the communication service provider's network. These access tools include, for example, the use of a virtual private network (VPN) or similar techniques for enabling secure and authenticated connections from devices not directly connected to the employer's network. Moreover, even if the employer's network supported such a tool, the customer's communication device could still not access the data if the user's device itself was not configured to support that tool.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">In other situations, a customer may attempt to use an unsuitable communication device to retrieve data. For example, a user may attempt to employ a personal digital assistant or wireless telephone with a relatively simple browser to retrieve a Web page with a large amount of image or audio data. Before the large amount of data can be fully retrieved, the personal digital assistant or wireless telephone may “time out” and sever the connection. Alternately or additionally, the user may seek to download more data than the personal digital assistant or wireless telephone may store.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY</heading> <p num="p-0008">Advantageously, various examples of the invention allow a user to more conveniently send data to and retrieve data from a remote data store using a remote communication device. With different aspects of the invention, a data retrieval system includes an inbox (IB) server, referred to hereafter more generally as a “gateway server,” and a desktop access client (DAC), referred to hereafter more generally simply as an access client. The gateway server is communicatively connected to the access client through a network. The gateway server provides a presentation service (PS) and a real-time service (RTS), which cooperate with the access client to retrieve data from a data store and then provide the retrieved data to a user's remote communication device using a presentation protocol appropriate to the device's capabilities.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">With various implementations of the invention, the access client will create a connection to the gateway server. When the user wishes to retrieve data from the data store or to send data to the data store, the user establishes a communication connection between his or her remote communication device and the gateway server, and then requests the desired data from the gateway server. In response, the gateway server sends a command to the access client, instructing it to retrieve the requested data. The access client retrieves the requested data from the data store, and returns the retrieved data to the gateway server. The gateway server then relays the requested information back to the user's remote communication device through the presentation server using a presentation protocol appropriate to the device's capabilities.</p>

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading> <p num="h-0006">Overview</p>
    <p num="p-0015"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a schematic block diagram of a data retrieval system <b>100</b> according to various embodiments of the invention. The retrieval system <b>100</b> allows for the retrieval of data, such as data from a corporate data store, to a remote device. As seen in this figure, the data retrieval system <b>100</b> includes at least one gateway (IB) server <b>101</b> and an access client (DAC) <b>103</b>. In the illustrated example, the access client <b>103</b> is hosted by a user's computer <b>105</b>. The computer <b>105</b> is located in, for example, a corporate network environment <b>107</b> that includes the data store <b>109</b> from which data is to be retrieved. The data store <b>109</b> may be any type of data store, such as a database that organizes data, a server device that provides services to one or more client devices or a combination of the two. The data store <b>109</b> may be, for example, a Lotus Domino server or a Microsoft Exchange server that manages a variety of data including electronic mail messages, calendar information, contact information and the like. The corporate network environment <b>107</b> may also include a firewall <b>111</b> or other barrier for preventing unwanted access to the corporate network environment <b>107</b>. The data store <b>109</b> may also be a publicly available data store, such as, for example, a Yahoo email server or the like. Still further, the data store may be a generic IMAP or POP3 mail store, or even a store employing a desired file system, such as the NTFS file system.</p>
    <p num="p-0016">As shown in this figure, the gateway server <b>101</b> is communicatively connected to the access client <b>103</b> through a network <b>113</b>, such as a wide-area network. The network <b>113</b> may be a publicly accessible network, such as the Internet. Alternately, the network may be a private network (often referred to as an intranet), or a combination of public and private networks. The gateway server <b>101</b> provides a presentation service (PS) <b>115</b> and a real-time service (RTS) <b>117</b>, each of which will be explained in detail below. The presentation service <b>115</b> and the real-time service <b>117</b> of the gateway server <b>101</b> cooperate with the access client <b>103</b> to retrieve data from the data store <b>109</b> and then provide the retrieved data to the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0017">More particularly, the access client <b>103</b> creates a connection <b>121</b> (which may be, for example, a persistent connection) to the gateway server <b>101</b> through the firewall <b>111</b>. The access client <b>103</b> then lies dormant until it receives commands from the gateway server <b>101</b> to retrieve data from the gateway server <b>101</b> or to provide data to the gateway server <b>101</b>. When the user wishes to retrieve data from the data store <b>109</b> to the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> (or, alternately, to send data from the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> to the data store <b>109</b>), the user establishes a communication connection <b>123</b> between the remote communication device <b>119</b> with the gateway server <b>101</b>. Through the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>, the user then requests the desired data from the gateway server <b>101</b>. In response, the gateway server <b>101</b> sends a command over the connection <b>121</b> to the access client <b>103</b>, instructing the access client <b>103</b> to retrieve the requested data. In response, the access client <b>103</b> retrieves the requested data from the data store <b>109</b>, and returns the retrieved data to the gateway server <b>101</b>. The gateway server <b>101</b> then relays the requested information back to the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>. This process, together with the components of the system <b>100</b>, will be discussed in more detail below.</p>
    <p num="h-0007">Operating Environment</p>
    <p num="p-0018">As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, the gateway server <b>101</b> may be implemented using one or more computing devices, such as a programmable computer that may be programmed to send, retrieve and store the data files that make up electronic messages. This type of computer can be embodied by, for example, an electronic mail account server. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows one example of such a programmable computer system <b>201</b> capable of retrieving and caching electronic mail data files from one or more outside electronic mail accounts. The computer system <b>201</b> includes a processing unit <b>203</b>, a system memory <b>205</b>, and a system bus <b>207</b> that couples various system components, including the system memory <b>105</b>, to the processing unit <b>203</b>. The system memory <b>205</b> may include a read-only memory (ROM) <b>209</b> and a random access memory (RAM) <b>211</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0019">A basic input/output system <b>213</b> (BIOS), containing the routines that help to transfer information between elements within the computer system <b>201</b>, such as during startup, may be stored in the read-only memory (ROM) <b>209</b>. If the computer system <b>201</b> is embodied by a personal computer, it may further include a hard disk drive <b>215</b> for reading from and writing to a hard disk (not shown), a magnetic disk drive <b>217</b> for reading from or writing to a removable magnetic disk (not shown), an optical disk drive <b>219</b> for reading from or writing to a removable optical disk (not shown) such as a CD-ROM or other optical media, or a memory card <b>221</b>, such as a flash memory card.</p>
    <p num="p-0020">A number of program modules may be stored on the ROM <b>209</b>, the hard disk drive <b>215</b>, the magnetic disk drive <b>217</b>, and the optical disk drive <b>219</b>. A user may enter commands and information into the computer system <b>201</b> through an input device <b>223</b>, such as a keyboard, a pointing device, a touch screen, a microphone, a joystick or any other suitable interface device. Of course, the computer system <b>201</b> may employ a variety of different input devices <b>223</b>, as is known in the art. An output device <b>225</b>, such as a monitor or other type of display device, is also included to convey information from the computer system <b>201</b> to the user. As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, a variety of output devices <b>225</b>, such as speakers and printers, may alternately or additionally be included in the computer system <b>201</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0021">In order to access electronic mail accounts, the computer system <b>201</b> preferably is capable of operating in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as the remote computer <b>227</b>. The computer system <b>201</b> may be connectable to the remote computer <b>227</b> through a local area network (LAN) <b>229</b> or a wide area network (WAN), such as the Internet. When used in a networking environment, the computer system <b>201</b> may be connected to the network through an interface <b>228</b>, such as a wireless transceiver, a modem, an Ethernet connection, or any other suitable interface. While the interface <b>228</b> is illustrated as an internal interface in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it may alternately be an external interface as is well known in the art. Of course, it will be appreciated that the network connections described above are exemplary, and other means of establishing a communications link with other computers may be used.</p>
    <p num="h-0008">Use of the Presentation Service and the Real-Time Service</p>
    <p num="p-0022">With various embodiments of the invention, the data retrieved from the data store <b>109</b> may be requested and received over a wide area network, such as the Internet. This type of communication medium is relatively unpredictable, however, and the existing level of traffic over the network may affect the speed at which the real-time service <b>117</b> receives requested data. Further, a request for data from the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> will not typically specify the size of the requested data. For example, a user may employ the remote communication device <b>119</b> to request his or her most recent email message from the data store <b>109</b> without knowing the size of the message. Accordingly, when the presentation service <b>115</b> receives a request for data from the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>, the presentation service <b>115</b> typically cannot ascertain when it will receive the requested data from the access client <b>103</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0023">This uncertainty presents a problem in that the presentation service <b>115</b> cannot determine in advance how long to maintain the connection <b>123</b> to the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>. Typically, the remote communication device <b>119</b> will maintain an idle connection for only a preset time period before severing the connection. Thus, in some situations, the time between when the presentation service <b>115</b> requests the data from the real-time service <b>117</b> and when the presentation service <b>115</b> receives the requested data in reply may be longer than the amount of time that the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> will wait for a reply from the presentation service <b>115</b> before severing the connection <b>123</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0024">In addition, the communications network supporting the communication device also may implement timeout procedures that are configured separately and independently from either the remote communications device <b>119</b> or the gateway server <b>101</b>. These procedures may be used by communications service providers to prevent idle connections from consuming network resources that might otherwise be allocated to active connections. Thus, the communications network itself may timeout and sever the connection <b>123</b> to the gateway server <b>101</b> before a reply from the presentation service <b>115</b> has been received.</p>
    <p num="p-0025">Moreover, different types of remote communication devices <b>119</b> will have different waiting periods before severing an idle connection (that is, a connection where data is not being exchanged). More particularly, some types of remote communication devices <b>119</b> may employ a relatively sophisticated communication software application that will maintain an idle connection for several minutes. For example, if the remote communication device <b>119</b> is a laptop personal computer, it may use a version of the Microsoft Internet Explorer browser to communicate with the presentation service <b>115</b>. This type of communication software application is typically configured to receive rich data with graphics and colors, and thus will wait a relatively long time for a reply from the presentation service <b>115</b> before “timing out” and severing the connection <b>123</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0026">On the other hand, a less sophisticated remote communication device <b>119</b> may employ a communication software application intended to receive only very simple data and that will only briefly maintain an idle connection. For example, a wireless telephone may communicate with the presentation service <b>115</b> using a streamlined browser that receives only text data and is designed to be navigated with a keypad. This type of simply communication software application will typically wait only a relatively short period of time for a reply from the presentation service <b>115</b> before timing out and severing the connection <b>123</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0027">To address this discrepancy between different types of remote communication devices <b>119</b> and their different supporting communications networks, the gateway server <b>101</b> according to various embodiments of the invention may employ both the presentation service <b>115</b> and the real-time service <b>117</b>. More particularly, with various embodiments of the invention, the real-time service <b>117</b> maintains the connection <b>121</b>, which may be a persistent connection, to the access client <b>103</b>. The presentation service <b>115</b> then manages the connection <b>123</b> with various remote communication devices <b>119</b> through various communications networks. Thus, the presentation service <b>115</b> and the real-time service <b>117</b> cooperate together to provide asynchronous retrieval of data from the data store <b>109</b> to the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>. That is, the timing of communications between the real-time service <b>117</b> and the data store <b>109</b> (through the access client <b>103</b>) is independent of the timing of communications between the presentation service <b>115</b> and a user's remote communication device <b>119</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0028">According to various embodiments of the invention, the connection <b>121</b>, the connection <b>123</b>, or both may be encrypted. For example, the connection <b>121</b>, the connection <b>123</b>, or both may be encrypted using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. The encryption may be on a connection-by-connection basis. Thus, the connection <b>121</b> may be encrypted using one set of encryption information shared between the access client <b>103</b> and the real-time service <b>117</b>, while the connection <b>123</b> may be encrypted using another set of encryption information shared between the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> and the presentation service <b>115</b>. Alternately, with various embodiments of the invention, the connections <b>121</b> and <b>123</b> may be commonly encrypted “end-to-end,” using encryption information shared between the user's remove communication device <b>119</b> and the access client <b>103</b>.</p>
    <p num="h-0009">Asynchronous Retrieval of Data</p>
    <p num="p-0029">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3D</figref>, these figures illustrate a flowchart for one process that may occur according to various embodiments of the invention when the user desires to send data to or retrieve data from the data store <b>109</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, in order to employ the system <b>100</b>, a user first installs the access client <b>103</b> on a computer that has access to the data store <b>109</b> (that is, on the computer <b>105</b>) in step <b>301</b>. For example, if the data store <b>109</b> is a Microsoft Exchange server that manages the user's electronic mail messages, the user will install the access client <b>103</b> on a computer that has access to the user's electronic mail account on the data store <b>109</b>. As part of the installation process for some embodiments of the invention, the user may submit authentication information. This authentication information then later can be used to authenticate the user's identity when the user attempts to retrieve data to or send data from the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0030">In many situations, the user will employ the system <b>100</b> to send or receive electronic mail messages or other data from a data store <b>109</b> maintained by the user's employer. Accordingly, the data store <b>109</b> is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as being within a corporate network environment <b>107</b>, which may be behind the firewall <b>111</b>, as previously noted. In these situations, the computer <b>105</b> may be the user's personal work computer that is also within the corporate network environment <b>107</b> and behind the firewall <b>111</b>, and thus has easy access to the data store <b>109</b>. It should be appreciated, however, that various embodiments of the invention may be employed to retrieve data from or send data to a data store <b>109</b> located within any computing environment. Also, any computing device having the desired access to the data store <b>109</b> may serve as the computer <b>105</b>. Further, as will be explained in detail below, a user may employ multiple access clients <b>103</b> on different computers <b>105</b> to retrieve data from or send data to the data store <b>109</b>, and multiple users may employ a shared access client <b>103</b> on a single computer <b>105</b> to retrieve data from or send data to the data store <b>109</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0031">It should be appreciated that, while the access client <b>103</b> is described in the illustrated embodiment as a client hosted on a single computer <b>105</b>, various alternate embodiments of the invention may employ any configuration for the access client <b>103</b>. For example, the access client <b>103</b> may itself be implemented by a “server” computer that servers other computers in a network. Thus, the access client <b>103</b> may provide access to the data store <b>109</b> for more than one user. Further, the access client <b>103</b> may provide centralized management and administration tools that enable a system administrator (e.g., a system administrator for the data store <b>109</b>) to manage and control utilization of the access client <b>109</b> by individual users by e.g., selecting them from a directory or company address list. Moreover, the access client <b>103</b> may thus be implemented on a server that performs other functions, which may or may not be related to the operation of the access client <b>103</b>. For example, the access client <b>103</b> may be implemented on a public email server, such as a Yahoo or Hotmail email server, or on a private email server. Still further, with different embodiments of the invention, the operation of the access client <b>103</b> may be distributed among a plurality of computers <b>105</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0032">Returning now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, once the access client <b>103</b> has been installed on the computer <b>105</b> in step <b>301</b>, the access client <b>103</b> establishes a secure communication connection to the gateway server <b>101</b> in step <b>303</b>. More particularly, the access client <b>103</b> establishes a secure connection <b>121</b> with the real-time service <b>117</b> hosted by the gateway server <b>101</b>. An entry for the connection, referred to as a real-time session, also is created in the directory <b>127</b>. The directory <b>127</b> may be, for example, an Oracle database or other suitable database, or a Novell directory or other suitable directory. The entry for the connection <b>121</b> identifies both the user and the gateway server <b>101</b> hosting the real-time service <b>117</b> to which the connection <b>121</b> is made.</p>
    <p num="p-0033">According to various embodiments of the invention, the connection <b>121</b> may be a persistent connection that is maintained as long as both the access client <b>103</b> and the real-time service <b>117</b> are operating to provide service to a user. With still other embodiments of the invention, however, the connection <b>121</b> may be established on an as-instructed or periodic basis. Thus, various embodiments of the invention may employ heuristics to determine when the access client <b>103</b> establishes the connection <b>121</b> with the real-time service <b>117</b>. These heuristics may determine, for example, that the access client <b>103</b> will connect every minute (or some other time period) if it services a user (or users) who have not frequently retrieved data from the data store <b>109</b>. These heuristics may also determine that the access client <b>103</b> will persistently maintain connection <b>121</b> if it services a user (or users) who have frequently retrieved data from the data store <b>109</b>. Still further, various embodiments of the invention may employ these heuristics only under certain conditions, such as when network traffic for the network carrying the connection <b>121</b> increases above a threshold level, or when the real-time service <b>117</b> reaches some threshold of simultaneous connections <b>121</b> with multiple access clients <b>103</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0034">In order to subsequently retrieve data from the data store <b>109</b> to the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> (or to send data from the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> to the data store <b>109</b>), the user connects to the gateway server <b>101</b> through the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> in step <b>305</b>. More particularly, the user establishes the communication connection <b>123</b> from the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> to the presentation service <b>115</b> hosted by the gateway server <b>101</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0035">As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, in addition to personally initiating a connection with the gateway server <b>101</b> and requesting data from the data store <b>109</b>, one or more software applications running on the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> may also initiate the connection <b>123</b> to the presentation service <b>115</b> hosted by gateway server <b>101</b> on the user's behalf. Depending upon the purpose and needs of the particular software application, the software application can initiate the connection <b>123</b> on a periodic, scheduled, or event-driven basis and make one or more data requests asking to retrieve data from or sending data to the data store <b>109</b>. This approach relieves the user of the need to pro-actively initiate all connections and data requests or transfers and greatly improves the overall user experience.</p>
    <p num="p-0036">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> is a wireless communication device that exchanges data or voice information over a wide-area wireless telephone communication network <b>125</b>. For example, the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> may be a wireless telephone, or a personal digital assistant (PDA) or portable computer equipped with a wireless communication unit, such as a PCMCIA card like the Sierra Wireless AirCard®. With still other embodiments of the invention, however, the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> may be connected to the gateway server <b>101</b> through any suitable connection, including a public communication network such as the Internet. For example, the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> may alternately be connected to the gateway server <b>101</b> using a wired connection, such as a conventional “dial-up” or DSL telephone connection, a high-speed broadband connection provided by a cable television service provider, or even an optical connection. Further, the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> may be connected to the gateway server <b>101</b> through another communication device, such as a public Internet kiosk. Thus, rather than connecting to the gateway server <b>101</b> over the wireless network <b>125</b>, the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> may connect to the gateway server <b>101</b> over any suitable medium, including a wireless communication network, a wired communication network or a composite wired and wireless communication network.</p>
    <p num="p-0037">Similarly, the connection <b>121</b> between the access client <b>103</b> and the real-time service <b>117</b> can be made over any suitable medium. In the illustrated embodiment, the connection <b>121</b> is established over a public, wide-area communication network, such as the Internet. With alternate embodiments of the invention, however, the connection <b>121</b> may be the established over, for example, a private communication network, such as a private wireless telephone communication network. Thus, the connection <b>121</b> also may be established over a wireless communication network, a wired communication network, or a composite wired/wireless communication network.</p>
    <p num="p-0038">As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, a variety of communication techniques and protocols have been developed for exchanging data between devices. For example, communications over both high and low bandwidth connections may be made using well-known extensible markup language protocols, such as the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) protocol, the Extensible Markup Language (XML) or the Synchronization Markup Language (SyncML) or other messaging-centric protocols such as the Post Office Protocol (POP) or the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP). Similarly, communications over lower-bandwidth wireless connections (such as wireless telephone connections) may be made using the well-known Wireless Markup Language (WML) protocol. Any suitable protocol, including any of these known protocols, may be used to exchange data between the remote communication device <b>119</b> and the presentation service <b>115</b>, and between the access client <b>103</b> and the real-time service <b>117</b>. Thus, communications over the connection <b>121</b> between the access client <b>103</b> and the gateway server <b>101</b> may be made using HTML or XML pages, while communications over the connection <b>123</b> between the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> and the gateway server <b>101</b> may be made using HTML, XML, SyncML, or WML pages, or other protocols including, but not limited to, IMAP and POP3. Because the equipment and procedures for communicating data between devices using these protocols are well-known in the art, they will not be described in further detail here.</p>
    <p num="p-0039">Returning now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the user authenticates his or her identity for the presentation service <b>115</b> in step <b>307</b>. For example, the presentation service <b>115</b> may transmit one or more authentication inquiries to the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>. These inquiries, which may be contained on a single markup language page, may ask the user for a username and password. In response, the user transmits the requested authentication information back to the presentation service <b>115</b>. Of course, the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> may alternately or additionally provide one or more software applications for managing and presenting data, which includes user interface elements for collecting, storing, and submitting authentication information to the presentation service <b>115</b> without requiring the user to manually reenter the authentication information for each session with the presentation service <b>115</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0040">When the user wishes to retrieve data from the data store <b>109</b>, the user sends a request for the desired data over the connection <b>123</b> to the presentation service <b>115</b> in step <b>309</b>. For example, the user may request the header information for the most recent <b>10</b> electronic mail messages in the user's electronic mail account on the data store <b>109</b>. This request can be made using any suitable technique. For example, once the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> has established the connection <b>123</b> with the presentation service <b>115</b>, the presentation service <b>115</b> may transmit WML pages with prompts to the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>. These pages may, for example, contain a list of possible information that can be requested by the user. After the user selects the prompts corresponding to the desired information, the selected prompts are transmitted back to the presentation service <b>115</b> as a request for the desired data. Of course, still other techniques for retrieved desired information from the data store <b>109</b> may be employed, including techniques where data is retrieved automatically by an application on the remote communication device <b>119</b> without requiring the user's intervention, as previously noted.</p>
    <p num="p-0041">In step <b>311</b>, the presentation service <b>115</b> establishes a presentation session for the connection <b>123</b> with the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>. The presentation service <b>115</b> thus associates all subsequent communications related to the request for the desired data with the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>. For example, the presentation session may be an entry in memory, such as a data table, associating the user's username and password with a presentation session value. The presentation session may also identify a location in memory, cache <b>1151</b>, at which the desired data will be stored upon retrieval, and a flag indicating if the desired data as been stored to the cache <b>1151</b>. The use of the presentation session to retrieve data from the data store <b>109</b> to the remote communication device <b>119</b> will be discussed in further detail below.</p>
    <p num="p-0042">In step <b>313</b>, the presentation service <b>115</b> checks to see if the desired information has already been cached in the cache <b>1151</b>. As will be discussed in detail below, if the presentation service <b>115</b> determines that it already has cached the desired information then, in step <b>315</b>, the presentation service <b>115</b> immediately retrieves the desired information from the cache <b>1151</b> and returns the desired information to the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>. When the request for the desired data is initially made to the presentation service <b>115</b>, however, the desired data probably will not have already been cached by the presentation service <b>115</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0043">Accordingly, when the desired data is not currently in the cache <b>1151</b>, a request for the desired data is sent from the presentation service <b>115</b> to the real-time service <b>117</b> in step <b>317</b>. In response, the real-time service <b>117</b> issues a command over the connection <b>121</b> to the access client <b>103</b> in step <b>319</b>, instructing the access client <b>103</b> to retrieve the desired information from the data store <b>109</b>. Upon receiving the command from the real-time service <b>117</b>, the access client <b>103</b> retrieves the desired data from the data store <b>109</b> in step <b>321</b>. Then, in step <b>323</b>, the access client <b>103</b> returns the retrieved data to the real-time service <b>117</b>, which in turn provides the retrieved data to the presentation service <b>115</b> in step <b>325</b>. The presentation service <b>115</b> then stores the retrieved data in the cache <b>1151</b> in step <b>327</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0044">In step <b>329</b>, the presentation service <b>115</b> determines if the request for the data is still pending from the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>. That is, the presentation service <b>115</b> determines if the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> is still maintaining the connection <b>123</b> in wait for the desired data. If the request is still pending, then the retrieved data is provided to the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> in step <b>331</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0045">Thus, if the desired data can be retrieved by the gateway server <b>101</b> from the data store <b>109</b> within the idle time of the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>, then the desired data can be immediately provided to the user. In many situations, however, the gateway server <b>101</b> will not be able to retrieve the desired data before the idle time for the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> expires and the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> terminates the connection <b>123</b>. As will be discussed in more detail below, the presentation service <b>115</b> addresses these situations by responding to the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> before its idle time expires.</p>
    <p num="p-0046">More particularly, if the desired data is not retrieved before the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> terminates the connection <b>123</b>, then the presentation service <b>115</b> will send a message to the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> instructing the user (or the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>) to resubmit the request for the desired data. This response may be repeated until the desired data is retrieved from the data store <b>109</b> and stored in the cache <b>1151</b>. By using the presentations session to associate these subsequent requests with the initial request for the desired data, the desired data can be transmitted to the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> once it has been stored in the cache <b>1151</b>. That is, the desired data stored in the cache <b>1151</b> can be transmitted to the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> in response to an existing request for the data (i.e., over the existing connection <b>123</b>) or when the request is resubmitted to the presentation service <b>115</b>. Accordingly, desired data can be retrieved from the data store <b>109</b> on a real-time basis, regardless of the disparity between the idle time of the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> and the time required to obtain the desired data from the data store <b>109</b>.</p>
    <p num="h-0010">Communication with the Remote Communication Device</p>
    <p num="p-0047">As previously noted, the presentation service <b>115</b> manages communications with the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>, to ensure that the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> does not time out without receiving a reply to its request for data. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4E</figref> illustrate a flowchart showing one method that may be employed by the presentation service <b>115</b> according to various embodiments of the invention to reliably communicate with the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0048">As previously noted, in step <b>309</b> of the flowchart shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3D</figref>, the user sends the presentation service <b>115</b> a request for desired data from the data store <b>109</b>. In step <b>401</b>, the presentation service <b>115</b> determines if the request is a new request for the desired data, or if it is a resubmission of an earlier request for the desired data. If the request is a new request for the desired data, the presentation service <b>115</b> creates a presentation session in step <b>403</b>, and then passes the request along to the real-time service <b>117</b> to retrieve the desired data from the data store <b>109</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0049">According to various embodiments of the invention, the process of creating the presentation session in step <b>403</b> includes designating the cache <b>1151</b> to be used for caching information relating to the request for the desired data from the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>. As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill, the presentation service <b>115</b> may employ any memory resource available to the gateway server <b>101</b>. Because the requested data will be stored in the cache <b>1151</b> for immediate transmission to the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>, however, a memory resource that can be quickly accessed to provide the requested data to the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> may conveniently be used for the cache <b>1151</b>. With various embodiments of the invention, the cache <b>1151</b> may be encrypted or unencrypted.</p>
    <p num="p-0050">The process of creating the presentation session in step <b>401</b> also includes designating identification information identifying the presentation session. This identification information is then provided to the real-time service <b>117</b> with the request for the desired information. When the real-time service <b>117</b> then returns the retrieved data retrieved from the data store <b>109</b>, it also provides the corresponding presentation session identification information. Using this returned presentation session identification information, the presentation service <b>115</b> stores the retrieved data in the cache <b>1151</b> associated with the presentation session. It should be appreciated that any suitable identification information may be used to identify the presentation session for the data request. For example, the identification information may be a specific code or password. Alternately, with some embodiments of the invention, the identification information may be the memory address of the location of the cache <b>1151</b> for the presentation session.</p>
    <p num="p-0051">In step <b>405</b>, the presentation service <b>115</b> also initiates a timer <b>1153</b> for the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> corresponding to the presentation session. As will be discussed in more detail below, the timer <b>1153</b> will be used to predict when the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> will time out and sever the connection <b>123</b> to the presentation service <b>115</b>. Further, in step <b>407</b>, the presentation service <b>115</b> determines device type information for the device <b>119</b> that has requested the data. That is, the presentation service <b>115</b> determines information about the type of device making the request that will allow the presentation service <b>115</b> to identify operational characteristics for the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0052">With some implementations of the invention, the presentation service <b>115</b> may determine only a general category into which the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> can be classified. For example, with some embodiments of the invention, the presentation service <b>115</b> may determine whether the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> is employing WML, HTML, SyncML, IMAP or POP or the like to communicate. If the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> is using HTML, the presentation service <b>115</b> then determines if the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> is a personal computer or a personal digital assistant (PDA). Thus, if the user is employing, for example, a Toshiba PocketPC® PDA device to access the presentation service <b>115</b>, the presentation service <b>115</b> may categorize that device as a personal digital assistant HTML device.</p>
    <p num="p-0053">Still other embodiments of the invention, however, may determine different or more detailed information regarding the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>. For example, with some embodiments of the invention, the presentation service <b>115</b> may determine the specific browser (or other communication software) being used by the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> to communicate with the presentation service <b>115</b>, particular settings for that communication software, or any other information that might be useful to determine how the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> will communicate with the presentation service <b>115</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0054">With some embodiments of the invention, this device type information may conventionally be provided by the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> when it initiates the connection <b>123</b>. For example, if the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> sends a request for data using an HTML page, that page may conventionally include information that the presentation service <b>115</b> can use to determine the type of browser that the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> is employing to communicate with the presentation service <b>115</b>. Alternate embodiments of the invention, however, may employ alternate techniques to provide the device type information to the presentation service <b>115</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0055">For example, with some implementations of the invention, the user may specify the device type information for the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> when the user installs the access client <b>103</b> on the computer <b>105</b>. Alternately or additionally, the user may specify the device type information using a survey or questionnaire page (such as a HTML page) provided to the access client <b>103</b> or to the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>. Once the user has specified the device type information with the questionnaire page, the gateway server <b>101</b> may generate and place a cookie on the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>. When the user then employs the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> to request data from the presentation service <b>115</b> thereafter, the presentation service <b>115</b> can solicit the device type information from the cookie on the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> in reply. Of course, still other techniques for determining the device type information will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, and may be used with various embodiments of the invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0056">Once the presentation service <b>115</b> has determined the device type information for the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> in step <b>407</b>, the presentation service <b>115</b> employs that device type information to determine the communication characteristics of the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> in step <b>409</b>. Among various communication characteristics that may be identified by the presentation service <b>115</b>, the presentation service <b>115</b> determines how long the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> will wait for a reply to the request from the presentation service <b>115</b> before severing the connection <b>123</b>. That is, the presentation service <b>115</b> uses the device type information for the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> to determine the idle time of the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0057">For example, as previously noted, with the illustrated embodiment of the invention the presentation service <b>115</b> may determine if the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> is using WML or HTML to communicate and, if the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> is using HTML, whether the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> is a personal computer or a personal digital assistant. If the presentation service <b>115</b> determines that the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> is using WML to communicate, then the remote device <b>119</b> is probably a wireless telephone using a simple browser software application. Accordingly, the presentation service <b>115</b> may determine that the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> will only wait a small period of time (for example, 5 seconds) after submitting the request to receive a reply from the presentation service <b>115</b> before severing the connection <b>123</b>. On the other hand, if the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> is a personal computer employing HTML to communicate, then the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> is probably using a sophisticated browser software application, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer. The presentation service <b>115</b> may therefore determine that the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> will wait for a relatively long period of time (for example, two minutes) to receive a reply from the presentation service <b>115</b> before severing the connection.</p>
    <p num="p-0058">Various embodiments of the invention may employ different types of device type information to determine the device communication characteristics, as explained in detail above. Accordingly, different embodiments of the invention may also determine different types of device communication characteristics from the device type information. For example, if the presentation service <b>115</b> employs device type information that only identifies the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> as one of three broad categories of devices (e.g., a WML device, an HTML personal digital assistant device or an HTML personal computer device), then the presentation service <b>115</b> may correspondingly identify only one of three broad types of device communication characteristics. For example, it may determine that all WML devices will wait only 5 seconds for a reply, all HTML personal digital assistant devices will wait only 90 seconds for a reply, and that all HTML personal computer devices will wait only 2 minutes for a reply, regardless of the specific configuration of any particular device.</p>
    <p num="p-0059">If, however, the presentation service <b>115</b> employs more detailed device type information, such as the particular browser being used by the remote communication device <b>119</b>, then the presentation service <b>115</b> may correspondingly employ more specific device communication characteristics information. For example, the presentation service <b>115</b> may determine that a device <b>119</b> using the Microsoft Internet Explorer, Version 6.0, will wait only three minutes for a reply from the presentation service <b>115</b> before severing the connection <b>123</b>, while a device using a Sony-Ericsson browser for wireless GSM telephones will wait only 45 seconds for a reply from the presentation service <b>115</b> before severing the connection <b>123</b>. As will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, the level of detail of the device characteristics information may depend upon the level of detail of the device type information obtained by the presentation service <b>115</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0060">With various embodiments of the invention, the presentation service <b>115</b> may obtain the device characteristics information from, for example, a look-up table such as the device characteristics table <b>1155</b>. The table <b>1155</b> may be populated using any conventional technique. For example, the device characteristics in the table <b>1155</b> may be populated when the server is initialized. Alternately, the gateway server <b>101</b> may populate the table <b>1155</b> by seeking the appropriate device characteristics information from a remote source, such as, for example, the Internet, for each new type of remote communication device <b>119</b> that is employed by a user.</p>
    <p num="p-0061">In the illustrated embodiment, the table <b>1155</b> is a component of the presentation service <b>115</b>, in order to allow the presentation service <b>115</b> to more quickly retrieve the device characteristics information. Alternate embodiments of the invention, however, may have the table <b>1155</b> located in the real-time service <b>117</b>, an independent database directly or indirectly accessible by the presentation service <b>115</b>, or even in the access client <b>103</b>. Still other embodiments of the invention may employ other techniques to determine the device characteristics information. For example, if the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> provides a cookie to the presentation service <b>115</b> with the device type information, as discussed above, this cookie may also include the device characteristics information for the device <b>119</b>. Further, with various embodiments of the invention, the use of the device information to determine the device characteristics information may be omitted entirely. Instead, for example, with these embodiments of the invention the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> may provide the appropriate device characteristics information directly to the presentation service <b>115</b> when making a request for data.</p>
    <p num="p-0062">It should also be appreciated that, in addition to the idle time for the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>, the device characteristics information may include other data as desired. For example, the device characteristics information may identify a particular data format employed by the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>, a transmission speed for transmitting the retrieved data to the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>, or other useful information corresponding to the device type of the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0063">Returning now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, when the presentation service <b>115</b> has determined the device characteristics for the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>, the presentation service <b>115</b> sets a threshold for the timer <b>1153</b> in step <b>411</b> using the determined device characteristic information for the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>. More particularly, the presentation service <b>115</b> sets a value for the timer <b>1153</b> at which the presentation service <b>115</b> will generate and send a reply to the request for data from the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>. The threshold value is selected to allow the presentation service <b>115</b> time to reply to the user's remote communication device's request for data before the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> times out and severs the connection <b>123</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0064">As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, the specific threshold set for a timer <b>115</b> can be predicated upon a variety of factors, including the amount of time necessary to prepare and send a suitable reply. Thus, if a device <b>119</b> is using a sophisticated browser that requires a complex reply (including, for example, graphics), then the threshold may be set to allow more time for a reply than when the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> is using a simple browser that requires only a text reply.</p>
    <p num="p-0065">For example, if the presentation service <b>115</b> has determined that the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> is using a simple browser and will wait only 5 seconds for a reply before severing the connection <b>123</b>, then the presentation service <b>115</b> may set the threshold for the timer <b>1153</b> to be 3 seconds, allowing 2 seconds to generate and send the reply message. If, however, the presentation service <b>115</b> has determined that the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> is using a sophisticated browser and will wait two minutes for a reply before severing the connection <b>123</b>, then the presentation service <b>115</b> may set the threshold for the timer <b>1153</b> to be 1 minute, 50 seconds, thereby allowing more time (i.e., 10 seconds) to prepare and send a more complex reply before the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> times out and severs the connection <b>123</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0066">With various embodiments of the invention, still other factors can be taken into account when determining the threshold value for the time <b>1153</b>, including, for example, current traffic conditions for the network <b>125</b> and the degree of reliability desired for the connection <b>123</b>. Alternately, a single threshold value can be designated for each category of device type. Thus, for example, all communication devices <b>119</b> using WML may have a first threshold value for the timer <b>1153</b>, all communication devices <b>119</b> that are HTML-using personal digital assistant devices can have a second threshold value for the timer <b>1153</b>, and all communication devices <b>119</b> that are HTML-using personal computers can have a third threshold value for the timer <b>1153</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0067">Of course, with still other embodiments of the invention, a single time period can be used to determine the timer threshold value for all types of communication devices <b>119</b>, regardless of their individual device communication characteristics. For example, the timer threshold value can be set for all types of devices so that the presentation service <b>115</b> employs only a single time period for all types of devices. With these embodiments of the invention, the determination of both the device type information and the corresponding device characteristics information may be omitted.</p>
    <p num="p-0068">It should also be noted that, while steps <b>401</b>-<b>411</b> have been described above as being in a specific order, other embodiments of the invention may order these steps in any desired manner. For example, some embodiments of the invention may set the threshold value and initiate the timer <b>1153</b> before relaying the request for data to the real-time service <b>117</b>. Alternately, some embodiments of the invention may relay the request for data to the real-time service <b>117</b> before determining the threshold value and initiating the timer <b>1153</b>. Still further, with some embodiments of the invention, the presentation service <b>115</b> may set the threshold value for the timer <b>1153</b> before initiating the timer <b>1153</b>, while, with still other embodiments of the invention, the timer <b>1153</b> can be started before the threshold value for the timer <b>1153</b> is determined. Moreover, for example, with some embodiments of the invention, the presentation service <b>115</b> may designate the cache <b>1151</b> after the request for data has been relayed to the real-time service <b>117</b>, before the request for data has been relayed to the real-time service <b>117</b>, before the timer <b>1153</b> has been set, or after the timer <b>1153</b> has been set.</p>
    <p num="p-0069">In any case, once the threshold value for the timer <b>1153</b> has been set and the request for data relayed to the real-time service <b>117</b>, the presentation service <b>115</b> then monitors the real-time service <b>117</b> in step <b>413</b> for a reply containing the retrieved data and the identification information identifying the presentation session corresponding to the request for the retrieved data. If a reply is not received, then in step <b>415</b> the presentation service <b>115</b> determines if the timer <b>1153</b> has reached its threshold value. If the timer <b>1153</b> has not reached its threshold value, then the presentation service <b>115</b> continues to monitors the real-time service <b>117</b> for a reply with the requested data. If, however, the timer <b>1153</b> has reached its threshold value, then the presentation service <b>115</b> sends a reply to the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> in step <b>417</b>, indicating that the desired data has not yet been retrieved from the data store <b>109</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0070">More particularly, when the presentation service <b>115</b> determines that the threshold value has been reached, it formulates and sends a reply to the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> indicating that the desired data has not yet been retrieved. It should be appreciated that any suitable type of reply message may be employed by various embodiments of the invention. For example, with some embodiments of the invention, the reply message may be a page (such as an HTML or WML page) that displays a message to the user stating that the desired data has not yet been retrieved. With some embodiments of the invention, the reply message may additionally prompt the user to manually resubmit the request for the desired data. Thus, the reply message may display an invitation to the user to resubmit the request, along with a command prompt to resubmit the request. When the user activates the command prompt, associated software code in the reply page will instruct the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> to resubmit the request. Such automatic reply operations are well known, and thus will not be discussed in further detail. With still other embodiments of the invention, however, the reply message may simply include software instructing the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> to automatically resubmit the request of the desired data. With these embodiments of the invention, the reply message may thus omit displaying a message to the user.</p>
    <p num="p-0071">For various embodiments of the invention, the reply message will also include presentation session identification data identifying the presentation session associated with the request. This presentation session identification information may be the same presentation session identification information provided to the real-time service <b>117</b>, or it may be different from the presentation session identification information provided to the real-time service <b>117</b>. Also, while the presentation session information provided to the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> may conveniently be transmitted with the reply message, it may also be transmitted in a separate communication. For example, the presentation session identification may be provided to the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> immediately after the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> has submitted an initial request for desired information.</p>
    <p num="p-0072">In any case, when the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> resubmits the request for the desired information, the resubmitted request includes the presentation session information associated with the initial request for the desired data. Thus, when the resubmitted request is received by the presentation service <b>115</b>, the presentation service <b>115</b> determines that the request matches an existing presentation session in step <b>401</b>. The presentation service <b>115</b> then proceeds immediately to step <b>413</b> to determine if the desired data has been retrieved from the data store <b>109</b> and stored in the cache <b>1151</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0073">If the desired data has been retrieved and cached in cache <b>1151</b>, then the desired data is immediately returned to the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>, as noted above. If, however, the desired data has still not been cached in the cache <b>1151</b>, then the process of steps <b>401</b> and <b>413</b>-<b>417</b> are repeated until the desired data is retrieved from the data store <b>109</b>, stored in the cache <b>1151</b>, and then provided to the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> in step <b>419</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0074">It should be noted that, with the illustrated embodiment, the presentation service <b>115</b> translates the retrieved data into a format that can be processed by the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> before transmitting the retrieved data to the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>. It should also be appreciated, however, that this translation can be made at any point. For example, with some embodiments of the invention, the retrieved data can be translated into an appropriate format before it is stored in the cache <b>1151</b>, while with other embodiments of the invention the retrieved data may be translated into an appropriate format just before it is transmitted to the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>. With still other embodiments of the invention, however, the requested data may alternately or additionally be translated by the access client <b>103</b>, the real-time service <b>117</b>, the data store <b>109</b> or even the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> itself. Still further, the translation may even be performed by a combination of these components (including the presentation service <b>115</b>).</p>
    <p num="p-0075">The request for data may thus be submitted and resubmitted by the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> until the desired data is retrieved from the data store <b>109</b> by the real-time service <b>117</b> and stored in the cache <b>1151</b>. If there is an error in retrieving the desired data, then the real-time service <b>117</b> may generate an error message informing the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> that the data cannot be retrieved. With some embodiments of the invention, this error message may be stored in the cache <b>1151</b> instead of the desired data. When the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> then retrieves data from the cache <b>1151</b>, it will retrieve the error message informing the user that the desired data could not be successfully retrieved from the data store <b>109</b>. Still other embodiments of the invention, however, may relay the error message immediately after receiving the error message from the real-time service <b>117</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0076">With some embodiments of the invention, the presentation service <b>115</b>, the real-time service <b>117</b>, or both may “pre-fetch” data from the data store <b>109</b>. Thus, various embodiments of the invention may employ heuristics to predict how much data a user will request from the data store <b>109</b> base upon, e.g., the user's previous pattern of data retrieval. For example, some users will frequently retrieve new email messages from their email account. For such a user, the presentation service <b>115</b> (or the real-time service <b>117</b>) may independently periodically request all new email messages for the user from the data store <b>109</b>. Accordingly, when the user employs the remote communication device <b>119</b> to retrieve his or her new email messages, that data will already be stored in the cache <b>1151</b>. Still other users, however, may only occasionally request new email messages. For these users, the presentation service <b>115</b> (or the real-time service <b>117</b>) may not independently request new email messages from the data store <b>109</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0077">Similarly, some users will regularly request particular combinations of data. For example, some users will typically request retrieval of an email message, and then immediately request retrieval of any attachments to retrieved email messages. With these users, the presentation service <b>115</b> (or the real-time service <b>117</b>) may independently request attachment data with any requests to retrieve new email messages for the user from the data store <b>109</b>. Accordingly, when such a user then follows a request to retrieve a new email message with a request to retrieve attachment data for the retrieved email message, that attachment data will already be stored in the cache <b>1151</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0078">Of course, various embodiments of the invention may employ further heuristics instead of or in addition to heuristics relating to retrieval frequency or the type of data retrieved. Such heuristics may include, for example, the level of service subscribed to by a user, the size of the data typically retrieved, or any other desired heuristics evaluation. Also, in addition to storing independently retrieved data in the cache <b>1151</b>, various embodiments of the invention may also go ahead and forward the independently retrieved data to the remote communication device <b>119</b> without receiving an express request to retrieve that data.</p>
    <p num="h-0011">Communication with the Access Client</p>
    <p num="p-0079">As previously noted, the real-time service <b>117</b> retrieves the desired data from the data store <b>109</b> through the access client <b>103</b>. More particularly, when the real-time service <b>117</b> receives a request for data from the presentation service <b>115</b>, it relays that request to the access client <b>103</b>. Because the access client <b>103</b> is hosted on the computer <b>105</b> that has access to the data store <b>109</b>, the access client <b>103</b> can instruct the computer <b>105</b> to retrieve the desired data from the data store <b>109</b>. When the computer <b>105</b> has obtained the desired data from the data store <b>109</b>, the access client <b>103</b> returns the desired data to the real-time service <b>117</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0080">With some embodiments of the invention, the real-time service <b>117</b> may communicate with the access client <b>103</b> using conventional communication techniques available to the computer <b>105</b>, to thereby establish the connection <b>121</b>. In some situations, however, the computer <b>105</b> will be located in an environment shielded from unauthorized access by a barrier, such as the firewall <b>111</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In these situations, the barrier may prevent many types of conventional two-way communication between the computer <b>105</b> (and thus the access client <b>103</b>) and the real-time service <b>117</b>. With these embodiments of the invention, the real-time service <b>117</b> and the access client <b>103</b> may communicate using any suitable communication technique, such as the use of a virtual private network (VPN). In some situations, however, even if the barrier can be configured to allow for conventional two-way communication between the computer <b>105</b> and the real-time service <b>117</b>, the process of reconfiguring the barrier may be onerous, particularly if a large number of users are employing different computers <b>105</b> to retrieve data from a remote communication device.</p>
    <p num="p-0081">Accordingly, with various embodiments of the invention the real-time service <b>117</b> may employ a connection to the access client <b>103</b> through the network <b>113</b> that will pass through the firewall. As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, various firewall systems will typically allow one or more specific access points by which a computer, such as the computer <b>105</b>, may receive data from sources outside of the firewall. For example, conventional firewalls typically designate a port (sometimes identified as Port <b>80</b>) through which a computer may receive data from outside sources. The real-time service <b>117</b> according to various embodiments of the invention may thus use such an access port to employ a one-way communication connection with the access client <b>103</b> through this type of designated port.</p>
    <p num="p-0082">Using this one-way communication connection, hereafter referred to as the command channel, the real-time service <b>117</b> may send instructions to the access client <b>103</b>. More particularly, the real-time service <b>117</b> may send instructions commanding the access client <b>103</b> to retrieve and relay information, such as the desired information, back to the real-time service <b>117</b>. It also should be noted that the real-time service <b>117</b> may use the one-way command channel to instruct the access client <b>103</b> to retrieve information from a location other than the data source <b>109</b> as well. For example, a user may wish to add information, such as a new electronic mail message, to the data store <b>109</b> for storage or action. Upon receiving the new data from the user's remote communication device <b>119</b>, the presentation service <b>115</b> (through the real-time service <b>117</b>) may then instruct the access client <b>103</b> to retrieve the new data from the real-time service <b>117</b> for delivery to the data store <b>109</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0083">Thus, with various embodiments of the invention, the command channel may be used only to send commands from the gateway server <b>101</b> to the access client <b>103</b>. Because a command typically will be an instruction to take some action (e.g., retrieve headers for the first ten messages in the electronic mail folder “inbox” of the user, retrieve today's appointments from the electronic calendar for the user, perform a search for the text “Mike” in the electronic mail folder “contacts” of the user, etc.), the commands will usually be relatively small (e.g., less than 1 kB). As a result of their small size, multiple commands can be multiplexed on the command channel.</p>
    <p num="p-0084">In turn, the access client <b>103</b> can send data associated with the command to the real-time service <b>117</b> (or retrieve data associated with the command from the real-time service <b>117</b>) over one or more alternate connections, collectively referred to hereafter as data channels. For example, the commands may include a specific address to which the associated data should be posted (or from which the associated data should be retrieved). The command may also include a parameter that can subsequently be used by the access client <b>103</b> to identify that its response (either posting or retrieving data) is a reply to that specific command. Using this information, the access client <b>103</b> may then post data to the specified address (or retrieve data from the specified address) through a different socket from the socket used by the command channel. Similarly, the access client <b>103</b> may also post various commands to the real-time service <b>117</b>. These commands may, for example, relate to the authorization of additional users for the access client <b>103</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0085">Thus, a reply to a command from the real-time service <b>117</b> will not interfere with the access client's receipt of new commands from the real-time service <b>117</b>, or with the transmission of data associated with responses to earlier commands. Advantageously, this arrangement improves the performance by allowing data channels to be established on as-needed basis directly to the physical server currently serving the user's device Together, the command channel and the data channels provide the connection <b>121</b> that allows two-way communication between the real-time service <b>117</b> and the access client <b>103</b> through a barrier such as a firewall.</p>
    <p num="p-0086">For example, the real-time service <b>117</b> may command the access client <b>103</b> to retrieve the desired data from the data store <b>109</b>, and then post the retrieved data, along with the presentation session identification information corresponding to the request, back to a specific address. The address may be a universal resource location (URL) address for a location maintained by the real-time service <b>117</b>, thereby allowing the real-time service <b>117</b> to retrieve the desired data from the access client <b>103</b>. The instructions (or a preceding or subsequent instruction) may also command the access client <b>103</b> to take some action with respect to the new data, such as storing the new data in the data store <b>109</b> or sending the new data to another location.</p>
    <p num="p-0087">As previously noted, when the access client <b>103</b> establishes the persistent connection <b>121</b> with the real-time service <b>117</b>, the real-time service <b>117</b> creates a real-time session for that connection. The real-time session may be, for example, a data object containing any desired data about the user and the connection, such as the port of the computer <b>105</b> through which the connection <b>121</b> is established. With some embodiments of the invention, the real-time session may be stored in the directory <b>127</b>. Alternately, the real-time session may be stored in another suitable memory location.</p>
    <p num="p-0088">For various embodiments of the invention, a proxy service may be employed between the access client <b>103</b> and the real-time service <b>117</b> (e.g., in the public wide area network <b>113</b>). With this type of arrangement, the proxy service may close the connection <b>121</b> on its own accord after a predetermined amount of time without an exchange of data over the connection. Alternately or addition, other problems could occur relating to the proxy service, causing it to sever the connection <b>121</b>. It would therefore be beneficial for the access client <b>103</b> to be able to detect when the connection <b>121</b> is severed, so that it can reestablish the connection <b>121</b>. Conventional application programming interfaces for network communications, however, such as conventional application programming interfaces for communicating using TCP/IP, are typically not convenient for providing an application feedback when a network connection suddenly closes. Moreover, the real-time service <b>117</b> will not necessarily know that the connection <b>121</b> has been severed until, for example, it tries to write to the socket through which the connection <b>121</b> was established.</p>
    <p num="p-0089">Accordingly, with various examples of the invention, the real-time service <b>117</b> may regularly send “heartbeat” messages to the access client <b>103</b>. These heartbeats may be, for example, small groups of data packets that can be sent to continually maintain the one-way connection between the real-time service <b>117</b> and the access client <b>103</b>. By periodically trying to send these heartbeats, the real-time service <b>117</b> can immediately detect when the connection <b>121</b> has been severed. Thus, by maintaining a continuous connection between the real-time service <b>117</b> and the access client <b>103</b>, the real-time service <b>117</b> will be prepared to immediately process requests for desired data from the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> without having to initiate a new command channel for each new request.</p>
    <p num="p-0090">With some embodiments of the invention, the heartbeat may include data indicating to the access client <b>103</b> when the next heartbeat from the real-time service <b>117</b> should be received. If the access client <b>103</b> then does not receive the next heartbeat within the indicated time period (and any additional buffer period, as desired), then the access client <b>103</b> can conclude that the connection <b>121</b> is severed and needs to be reestablished. Also, because the heartbeat is generated by the real-time service <b>117</b>, the time value indicating the rate of the heartbeat can be controlled by the real-time service <b>117</b>. More particularly, the rate data for the heartbeats can be adjusted by the real-time service <b>117</b> based upon, for example, the amount of traffic being handled by the gateway server <b>101</b>. Thus, the heartbeat is dynamically schedulable.</p>
    <p num="p-0091">For some implementations of the invention, the scheduled rate of the heartbeat may be the same for every connection <b>121</b>. Alternate embodiments of the invention, however, may have two separate intervals for heartbeats. More particularly, some embodiments of the invention may have one heartbeat rate for active presentation sessions where a user is presently using a communication device <b>119</b> to communicate with the gateway server <b>101</b>, and another heartbeat rate for inactive sessions. This arrangement can provide a quicker connection error detection time for sessions where a user will notice when the connection <b>121</b> is erroneously severed, and a less resource intensive connection error detection time where a user will not immediately notice when the connection <b>121</b> has been erroneously severed.</p>
    <p num="h-0012">Multiple Use of the Access Client</p>
    <p num="p-0092">While the use of the access client <b>103</b> was described above with reference to a single access client <b>103</b> accessing the data store <b>109</b>, various embodiments of the invention may have multiple access clients <b>103</b> communicating with the gateway server <b>101</b>. That is, each of a plurality of users can maintain an access client <b>103</b> communication with the gateway server <b>101</b>. Moreover, a user can employ multiple access clients <b>103</b> to communicate with the gateway server <b>101</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0093">Additionally, various embodiments of the invention may allow a single access client <b>103</b> to service more than one user. For example, with these embodiments, when a user installs the access client <b>103</b> on the computer <b>105</b>, the access client <b>103</b> may inquire as to whether the user wants to delegate remote access to the user's data in the data store <b>109</b> through anyone else (i.e., another user employing a different access client <b>103</b>). If the user would like the ability to access desired data in the data store <b>109</b> through another user's access client <b>103</b>, then the access client <b>103</b> may facilitate that arrangement.</p>
    <p num="p-0094">For example, if the access client <b>103</b> is being employed in a corporate network environment as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the access client <b>103</b> may provide the user with a list of other persons having access to the corporate data store <b>109</b> (e.g., everyone in a corporate email server). When the user selects another person from the list, the access client <b>103</b> may, e.g., arrange for the selected person to receive an email reporting his or her selection (along with instructions on how to obtain and install an access client <b>103</b>, if necessary). The user's access client <b>103</b> may also convey an encrypted message to the selected person, either by electronic mail or by another transmission technique. The encrypted message contains the information necessary to obtain the user's access to the data store <b>109</b>. Thus, if the selected person agrees to provide access to the data store <b>109</b> for the user, the selected person's access client <b>103</b> can employ the access information contained in the encrypted message to obtain the user's access to the data store <b>109</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0095">Advantageously, with some of the embodiments of the invention described above that employ a one-way command channel, the one-way command channel can service multiple users of the access client <b>103</b>. More particularly, commands corresponding to different users may be multiplexed over the single command channel. With this arrangement, when the access client <b>103</b> establishes the connection <b>121</b> with the real-time service <b>117</b>, it identifies the users that it is serving to the real-time service <b>117</b>.</p>
    <p num="h-0013">Use of Multiple Gateway Servers</p>
    <p num="p-0096">While the previous discussion described the user of only a single gateway server <b>101</b> for ease of understanding, many implementations of the invention would employ multiple gateway servers <b>101</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, to both increase capacity and redundancy. For example, some embodiments of the invention may employ gateway servers <b>101</b> in an N+1 architecture, including as many gateway servers <b>101</b> as needed for a desired capacity, plus an extra gateway server <b>101</b> for redundancy.</p>
    <p num="p-0097">A conventional N-tier Web service system may typically have between one and four tiers, depending upon the purpose of the service. For example, a conventional Web service system may include a first-tier Web server, a second-tier application server, and then a third-tier database server. In general, a user may access such a Web service system by presenting the Web server tier with a request, which then flows to the application server, and onto the database server in a vertical manner. This type of conventional network will often include one or more load balancers that route incoming requests based upon the current use of each server (i.e., the load balancer will route incoming requests to servers that are less occupied).</p>
    <p num="p-0098">With various embodiments of the invention, however, each user has at least one access client <b>103</b> installed on a computer <b>105</b>, which in turn establishes a persistent connection to a gateway server <b>101</b>. Thus, when a user employs a remote communication device <b>119</b> to transmit a request to the data retrieval system <b>100</b>′, it would be more efficient to specifically route the request to the gateway server <b>101</b> that has already established a persistent connection <b>121</b> to the user's access client <b>103</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0099">Advantageously, various implementations of the invention may conveniently match a user's incoming request to send or retrieve data with the user's access client <b>103</b>. As noted above, when an access client <b>103</b> connects with a real-time service <b>117</b>, the real-time service <b>117</b> creates a real-time session for that connection. While a real-time session exists for a persistent connection <b>121</b>, it may exist across multiple requests from remote communication devices <b>119</b>. That is, when a request from a remote communication device <b>119</b> is received by the presentation service <b>115</b>, it can be mapped through a real-time session to the real-time service <b>117</b> maintaining the connection <b>121</b> to the user's access client <b>103</b>. Moreover, each time that the request is subsequently received from the remote communication device <b>119</b>, it can again be mapped back to the proper real-time service <b>117</b> through the real-time session. Thus, these embodiments of the invention provide a collocation process to collocate a user's presentation session, maintained by a presentation service <b>115</b>, with the user's real-time session corresponding to the persistent connection established between the user's access client <b>103</b> and a real-time service <b>117</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0100">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, with collocation, when an access client <b>103</b>A is turned on, it negotiates a secure connection to a real-time service <b>117</b> provided by a gateway server (e.g., the real-time service <b>117</b>A provided by gateway server <b>101</b>A). In the process of establishing this connection, information pertaining to the connection is stored in the directory <b>127</b>. For example, when a user USER<b>1</b> employs the access client <b>103</b>A, the real-time service <b>117</b> may note that USER<b>1</b> has established a connection from the access client <b>103</b>A to gateway server <b>101</b>A (or to real-time service <b>117</b>A). It should be noted that, with some embodiments of the invention, a user may delegate his or access to a data store (e.g., data store <b>109</b>A in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) to multiple access clients <b>103</b> as described above. If a user thereby is associated with connections to multiple real-time services <b>117</b>, then suitable heuristics may be employed to select one connection to a gateway server <b>101</b> that is preferable to the others for the purpose of collocating a presentation session with a real-time session.</p>
    <p num="p-0101">When a user subsequently employs a remote communication device <b>119</b> to, e.g., submit a request for data from the data store <b>109</b>, the presentation service <b>115</b> receiving the request will initially authenticate the request, as discussed in detail above. For example, as previously noted, the presentation service <b>115</b> may provide the user's remote communication device <b>119</b> with an authentication user interface requesting the user's name, password, etc. Once the remote communication device <b>119</b> (i.e., the user) has been authenticated, the presentation service <b>115</b> makes a query to its associated real-time service <b>117</b>, which in turn queries the directory <b>127</b> as to the gateway server <b>101</b> (or, alternately, the real-time service <b>117</b>) corresponding to the user. More specifically, the real-time service <b>117</b> may query to the directory <b>127</b> whether the user has established an existing connection <b>121</b> between an access client <b>103</b> and a gateway server <b>101</b>, and if such a connection <b>121</b> currently exists, which gateway server <b>101</b> is maintaining the connection <b>121</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0102">If, for example, a request for data from USER<b>1</b> is initially routed to gateway server <b>101</b>B, by querying the directory <b>127</b> the gateway server <b>101</b>B can determine that the user's access client <b>103</b> is currently connected to the gateway server <b>101</b>A (i.e., to the real-time service <b>117</b>A). Based upon this information, the presentation service <b>115</b>B generates a redirect response for the remote communication device <b>119</b>. The redirect response may be device specific, but may not require any special software. Instead, the response may be, for example, a conventional HTML, WML or HDML redirect command. The redirect response then causes the remote communication device <b>119</b> to issue its subsequent requests for the desired data specifically to the gateway server <b>101</b>A. More particularly, the redirect response may, for example, provide the remote communication device <b>119</b> with software instructions, such an HTTP “cookie.” These software instructions contain routing information (or, alternately, are themselves routing information) to be included in subsequent submissions of the request for the desired data.</p>
    <p num="p-0103">Accordingly, when the remote communication device <b>119</b> resubmits a request for desired information, the routing information can be used to route the request directly to the presentation service <b>115</b> associated with the real-time service <b>117</b> maintaining a connection to the user's access client <b>103</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a data retrieval system <b>100</b>′ according to various implementations of the invention may employ one or more load balancers <b>501</b>. These load balancers <b>501</b> route both incoming data retrieval requests and incoming data submission requests from remote communication devices <b>119</b> to a gateway server <b>101</b>. With these embodiments, when a load balancer receives a request, it first checks to determine if the request contains routing information, such as a cookie as described above. If the request does not contain routing information, then the load balancer <b>501</b> assigns the request to a gateway server <b>101</b> based upon the current load distribution of all of the gateway servers <b>101</b>, as known in the art. If, however, the load balance <b>501</b> determines that a request does contain routing information, then it routes the request to the gateway server <b>101</b> identified in the routing information.</p>
    <p num="p-0104">As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, with this arrangement each load balancer <b>501</b> may have a public network address, such as a public Internet protocol (IP) address. The gateway servers <b>101</b> behind the load balancers <b>501</b> may then have virtual network addresses that cannot be directly accessed from outside of the network. For these implementations of the invention, the routing information will provide the virtual network address for the desired gateway server <b>101</b>, and the load balancer <b>501</b> receiving a request containing the routing information can then map the request to the identified gateway server <b>101</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0105">With various examples of the invention, the redirect response may also contain additional “handoff” information to be inserted into the subsequent requests for the desired data. When the routed gateway server <b>101</b> then receives a subsequent request for the desired, it can determine from the handoff information that the request is a handoff from another gateway server <b>101</b>. The handoff information may also contain a time stamp, so that the routed gateway server <b>101</b> can confirm that the handoff was recent. Using this information, it will associate the request with a presentation session on the initial gateway server <b>101</b>. The routed gateway server <b>101</b> can thus collocate the presentation session from the presentation service <b>115</b> of the initial gateway server <b>101</b> to its own presentation service <b>115</b>, so that its own presentation service <b>115</b> returns the desired data to the remote communication device <b>119</b> when it is retrieved.</p>
    <p num="p-0106">According to still other embodiments of the invention, the routed gateway server <b>101</b> may use the handoff information to employ the authentication performed by the initial gateway server <b>101</b>, thereby avoiding requiring that the user reauthenticate himself or herself. Accordingly, for these embodiments, the handoff information may be encrypted, to prevent unauthorized users from creating false handoff information to avoid authentication. Of course, the handoff information may be encrypted even if the routed gateway server <b>101</b> does not employ the authentication performed by the initial gateway server <b>101</b>. Also, it should be noted that, with various embodiments of the invention, the collocation process can alternately be performed by the load balancers <b>501</b>, but this may require customized code.</p>
    <p num="p-0107">Thus, referring back to the above example for USER<b>1</b>, after a request for data from USER<b>1</b> is initially routed to gateway server <b>101</b>B, the gateway server <b>101</b>B may determine from a query to the directory <b>127</b> that the user's access client <b>103</b> is currently connected to the gateway server <b>101</b>A (i.e., to the real-time service <b>117</b>A). Accordingly, the gateway server <b>101</b>B provides a redirect response to the remote communication device <b>119</b>A with handoff information. The handoff information will include routing information, such as, e.g., a virtual network address, for the gateway server <b>101</b>A. The handoff information may also be encrypted, and may include a time stamp and, e.g., confirmation of USER<b>1</b>'s authentication. When USER<b>1</b> resubmits requests for the desired information, the new requests will include the handoff information. Accordingly, when the load balancer <b>501</b>A receives the resubmitted requests, it will route the requests to the gateway server <b>101</b>A for handling.</p>
    <p num="p-0108">As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, there may be some situations where this collocation process may not be employed. For example, a user may initially employ a first access client <b>103</b> to retrieve data. If that first access client <b>103</b> then fails before the data is retrieved, the user may be forced to employ a second delegated access client <b>103</b> to retrieve the information. In this scenario, it would not be desirable to reroute subsequent requests to another gateway server <b>101</b>, as the gateway server <b>101</b> corresponding to the first access client <b>103</b> may already have some or all of the requested data in the cache <b>1151</b>. Also, collocation may not be desirable when a user first signs up to the data retrieval system with the computer <b>105</b>, but does not have an access client <b>103</b> installed yet.</p>
    <p num="p-0109">It also should be appreciated that, with different embodiments of the invention, a separate locator service may perform one or more of the collocation functions instead of the presentation service <b>115</b>. For example, with some embodiments of the invention, a locator service may query the directory <b>127</b> to determine the gateway server <b>101</b> to which the user's access client <b>103</b> is currently connected, and then generate a corresponding redirect response for the remote communication device <b>119</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0110">Of course, various embodiments of the invention may alternately or additionally employ conventional remote call procedures to associate a presentation session maintained by a presentation service <b>115</b> on a gateway server <b>101</b> with a connection <b>121</b> maintained by a real-time service <b>117</b> on a different gateway server <b>101</b>. Such remote call procedures may be employed, for example, instead of the collocation process described above, or if the collocation process fails for some reason.</p>
    <p num="h-0014">Secure Communication between the Access Client and the Real-Time Server</p>
    <p num="p-0111">To establish a secure connection to a computer, a browser will typically use an encryption protocol, such as the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, which employs the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technique. With this protocol, encryption key certificates are preinstalled, and public key and private keys are used during a “handshake” process to negotiate a session key for the connection. With an SSL handshake, a third party cannot determine the session key, even if all of the exchanged data is intercepted. This type of protocol requires a great deal of resource overhead to begin, however, and requires a great deal of resource overhead to maintain. Moreover, with various examples of the invention, the presentation service <b>115</b> may be implemented using a conventional Web server, but the real-time service <b>117</b> may be implemented using a different type of server. With this arrangement, the real-time service <b>117</b> may use HTTP and/or HTTPS communications, but only to deliver messages through firewalls (e.g., for requests to Port <b>80</b>, which conventionally are passed by firewalls).</p>
    <p num="p-0112">Accordingly, it would be beneficial to allow the access client <b>103</b> and the real-time service <b>117</b> without maintaining an SSL session. Advantageously, various embodiments of the invention allow the access client <b>103</b> to communicate with the real-time service <b>117</b> without having to maintain an SSL session. According to these embodiments, the load balancers <b>501</b> also serve as encryption protocol terminators in addition to load balancers. That is, the load balancer may have SSL software or hardware (e.g., SSL accelerator cards) that handles SSL communications very quickly. When the load balancer passes a communication onto a gateway server <b>101</b>, the communication thus is decrypted to a regular HTTP format (i.e., the load balancer <b>501</b> decrypts the communication before passing it to the gateway server <b>101</b>). These specialized load balancers are known in the art and may be obtained from a variety of sources, and thus will not be discussed in further detail.</p>
    <p num="p-0113">When the access client <b>103</b> attempts to establish a connection to the real-time service <b>117</b>, it does not communicate directly with the real-time service <b>117</b>. Instead, the access client <b>103</b> initially transmits an encrypted message, such as a HTTPS message, through a load balancer <b>501</b> to a presentation server <b>115</b>. The HTTPS message is received at the load balancer <b>501</b>, which decrypts the message and routes the message to a presentation service <b>115</b> as a HTTP message. More particularly, the load balancer <b>501</b> routes the request to the presentation service <b>115</b> of a gateway server <b>101</b> according to its balancing algorithm (e.g., to the gateway server <b>101</b> that is the least busy). The presentation service <b>115</b> then calls into the real-time service <b>117</b> to report that the access client <b>103</b> will soon be providing a request to establish a connection.</p>
    <p num="p-0114">In response, the real-time service <b>117</b> creates an entry in a list of pending connections (e.g., a table of access clients <b>103</b> that will soon be connecting to the real-time service <b>117</b>). In response, a unique session encryption key is generated (e.g., a 128-bit key), which is unrelated to the initial SSL communication between the access client <b>103</b> and the load balancer <b>501</b>. Any desired encryption algorithm, such as RC4, may be used to generate the encryption key. The entry in the table will thus include the identity of the access client <b>103</b>, a public session identification and a private encryption key.</p>
    <p num="p-0115">The presentation service <b>115</b> then sends an HTTP reply that contains the address (such as a universal resource location (URL) address) corresponding to the real-time service <b>117</b> to which the access client <b>103</b> should connect. The reply also includes the public session identification and the private encryption key. The access client <b>103</b> can then transmit a message to the real-time service <b>117</b> using the address (e.g., using a URL of the form http://www.gateway.com/real-timeserver sessionID=xxxxxx). Using this arrangement, the message sent from the access client <b>103</b> to the real-time service <b>117</b> may be an unencrypted HTTP message, but the data in the message can be encrypted using the private encryption key. The real-time service <b>117</b> can then use the session identification in the message to locate the appropriate entry in the table with the corresponding private encryption key. The real-time service <b>117</b> will then decrypt the contents of the message with the private encryption key.</p>
    <p num="p-0116">Thus, the access client <b>103</b> and the real-time service <b>117</b> can communicate without maintaining an encryption session. Instead, the access client <b>103</b> and the real-time service <b>117</b> can use the public session identification and the private encryption key to securely communicate. Moreover, by handing off the connection directly to the real-time service <b>117</b>, these embodiments of the invention can avoid maximizing the limit of the load balancer <b>501</b>. Of course, with still other embodiments of the invention, the access client <b>103</b> and the real-time service <b>117</b> can securely communicate while maintaining an encryption session (such as a SSL encryption session), but also have the data exchanged over the secure connection separately encrypted. That is, the data exchanged over the secure connection may use different encryption information, as described in detail above, than the encryption information used to maintain the secure connection.</p>
    <heading>CONCLUSION</heading> <p num="p-0117">While the invention has been described with respect to specific examples including presently preferred modes of carrying out the invention, those skilled in the art will appreciate that there are numerous variations and permutations of the above described systems and techniques that fall within the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims.</p>
