  <p num="p-0027"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a sectional view schematically showing the interior of an automatic speed changing device according to a first embodiment of the present invention, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an exploded perspective view showing a second travel unit and a conversion unit shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0028">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the automatic speed changing device <b>100</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention comprises a hub unit <b>110</b>, a first travel unit <b>130</b>, the second travel unit <b>150</b>, and the conversion unit <b>170</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0029">First, the hub unit <b>110</b> comprises a hub shaft <b>112</b> and a hub shell <b>114</b>. The hub shaft <b>112</b> has both ends supported by a frame (not shown) and is formed with a sun gear <b>116</b> in the middle thereof. The hub shaft <b>112</b> with the sun gear <b>116</b> formed as such is enclosed with the hub shell <b>114</b>. The hub shell <b>114</b> takes a shape with both open ends. One side of the hub shell <b>114</b> is rotatably secured on the hub shaft <b>112</b> by means of a first conical nut <b>118</b>. An inner peripheral surface of the other side of the hub shell <b>114</b> is integrally formed with a first ratchet ring <b>122</b> that has a plurality of first ratchet recesses <b>120</b> radially formed along the inner peripheral surface of the hub shell <b>114</b>. Inside the first ratchet ring <b>122</b>, an inner gear <b>124</b> is formed radially along the inner peripheral surface of the hub shell <b>114</b>. The first and second travel units <b>130</b> and <b>150</b> and the conversion unit <b>170</b> are arranged in the hub unit <b>110</b> constructed as above.</p>
  <p num="p-0030">The first travel unit <b>130</b> comprises a driver <b>132</b> and a driven sprocket <b>134</b>. The driver <b>132</b> closes the other side of the hub shell <b>114</b> while being rotatably secured on the hub shaft <b>112</b> by means of a second conical nut <b>136</b>. At this time, the driven sprocket <b>134</b> for receiving power from a driving sprocket (not shown) is mounted on an outer peripheral surface of the other side of the driver <b>132</b> which is exposed to the exterior of the hub shell <b>114</b>. An annular receiving recess <b>138</b> is formed inside the driver <b>132</b> on a side of the driver <b>132</b> extending toward the interior of the hub shell <b>114</b>. At the same time, a plurality of first pawls <b>140</b> selectively coming into close contact with the first ratchet recesses <b>120</b> of the first ratchet ring <b>122</b> to rotate the hub shell <b>114</b> are mounted on an outer peripheral surface of the receiving recess <b>138</b>, and a plurality of second pawls <b>142</b> are mounted on an inner peripheral surface of the receiving recess <b>138</b>. Preferably, the first and second pawls <b>140</b> and <b>142</b> resiliently protrude due to snap rings fitted into recesses formed at the centers thereof. When one-way rotational force is transmitted to the first and second pawls <b>140</b> and <b>142</b>, they can transmit the rotational force while maintaining their protruding states. On the contrary, when reverse rotational force is transmitted thereto, the first and second pawls <b>140</b> and <b>142</b> slide at the first and second ratchet recesses <b>120</b> and <b>176</b>, respectively, and resiliently enter recesses formed at outer and inner peripheral surfaces of the driver <b>132</b> so that they cannot transmit the rotational force.</p>
  <p num="p-0031">The second travel unit <b>150</b> comprises a first carrier <b>152</b>, and a second carrier <b>154</b> formed integrally with the first carrier <b>152</b>. The first carrier <b>152</b> is placed within the hub shell <b>114</b> while an inner peripheral surface of the first carrier encloses the sun gear <b>116</b>. An outer peripheral surface of the first carrier <b>152</b> is positioned to be close to the inner gear <b>124</b>. That is, the first carrier <b>152</b> takes the shape of a ring. A plurality of planet gears <b>156</b> are rotatably arranged in a radial direction on the outer peripheral surface of the first carrier <b>152</b>. A first spring coupling recess <b>158</b> is formed at a position in the other side surface of the first carrier <b>152</b> on the other side of the plurality of planetary gears <b>156</b>. At this time, radially inward portions of the outer peripheral surfaces of the planetary gears <b>156</b> are engaged with the sun gear <b>116</b>, and radially outward portions of the outer peripheral surfaces of the planetary gears <b>156</b> are engaged with the inner gear <b>124</b>. The second carrier <b>154</b> extends from the other side surface of the first carrier <b>152</b> toward the interior of the receiving recess <b>138</b> of the driver <b>132</b> while surrounding the hub shaft <b>112</b>. An annular guide <b>160</b> is formed at a distal end of the second carrier <b>154</b> to have a diameter smaller than that of the second carrier <b>154</b>. A first key protrusion <b>162</b> radially protrudes from a portion of the guide <b>160</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0032">Meanwhile, the conversion unit <b>170</b> comprises a second ratchet ring <b>172</b> and a conversion spring <b>174</b>. A plurality of second ratchet recesses <b>176</b> selectively coming into close contact with the second pawls <b>142</b> are formed on an outer peripheral surface of the second ratchet ring <b>172</b>, and an inner peripheral surface of the second ratchet ring is fitted around an outer peripheral surface of the second carrier <b>154</b>. At this time, the inner peripheral surface of the second ratchet ring <b>172</b> is formed with a second key protrusion <b>178</b> that selectively comes into close contact with the first key protrusion <b>162</b> while revolving along the guide <b>160</b>. A second spring coupling recess <b>180</b> is formed in one side surface of the second ratchet ring <b>172</b> to correspond to the first spring coupling recess <b>158</b>. Meanwhile, one end of the conversion spring <b>174</b> is mounted in the first spring coupling recess <b>158</b> and the other end thereof is mounted in the second spring coupling recess <b>180</b> so that the conversion spring can surround the second carrier <b>154</b>. That is, the second pawls <b>142</b> of the rotating driver <b>132</b> rotate the second ratchet ring <b>172</b>, and the second key protrusion <b>178</b> of the rotating second ratchet ring <b>172</b> revolves around the guide <b>160</b> and comes into close contact with the first key protrusion <b>162</b>, thereby rotating the second and first carriers <b>154</b> and <b>152</b>.

  <p num="p-0035">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref> <i>a </i>to <b>3</b> <i>c</i>, pedals (not shown) of a bicycle are operated to drive the driving sprocket (not shown) that in turn rotates the driven sprocket <b>134</b> and the driver <b>132</b> connected thereto through a chain (not shown). When the driver <b>132</b> is rotated in such a manner, the first pawls <b>140</b> of the driver <b>132</b> come into close contact with the first ratchet recesses <b>120</b> of the first ratchet ring <b>122</b>, thereby rotating the hub shell <b>114</b>. Consequently, the bicycle travels at low speed.</p>
  <p num="p-0036">Meanwhile, while the first pawls <b>140</b> come into close contact with the first ratchet ring <b>122</b>, the second pawls <b>142</b> come into close contact with the second ratchet recesses <b>176</b> of the second ratchet ring <b>172</b>, thereby rotating the second ratchet ring <b>172</b>. When the second ratchet ring <b>172</b> is rotated in such a manner, the second key protrusion <b>178</b> formed on the inner peripheral surface of the second ratchet ring <b>172</b> revolves along the guide <b>160</b>, and the conversion spring <b>174</b> is compressed in one direction.

As the first carrier <b>152</b> is rotated in such a manner, the planetary gears <b>156</b> mounted on the first carrier <b>152</b> rapidly rotate the inner gear <b>124</b> of the hub shell <b>114</b> that is rotating around the sun gear <b>116</b>.

At this time, the compressed conversion spring <b>174</b> is released to rotate the second ratchet ring <b>172</b> clockwise.

  <p num="p-0039">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the automatic speed changing device <b>200</b> according to the second embodiment of the present invention comprises a hub unit <b>210</b>, a first travel unit <b>230</b>, the second travel unit <b>250</b>, and the conversion unit <b>270</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0040">First, the hub unit <b>210</b> comprises a hub shaft <b>212</b>, a hub shell <b>214</b> and a hub driving body <b>216</b>. The hub shaft <b>212</b> has both ends supported by a frame (not shown) and is formed with a sun gear <b>218</b> in the middle thereof. The hub shaft <b>212</b> with the sun gear <b>218</b> formed as such is enclosed with the hub shell <b>214</b>. The hub shell <b>214</b> takes a shape with both open ends. One side of the hub shell <b>214</b> is rotatably secured on the hub shaft <b>212</b> by means of a first conical nut <b>220</b>. An inner peripheral surface of the other side of the hub shell is integrally formed with a first ratchet ring <b>224</b> that has a plurality of first ratchet recesses <b>222</b> radially formed along the inner peripheral surface of the hub shell. Meanwhile, the hub driving body <b>216</b> takes the shape of an annular ring and is detachably mounted at one side of the first ratchet ring <b>224</b> formed on the inner peripheral surface of the hub shell <b>214</b>. An inner peripheral surface of the hub driving body <b>216</b> is formed with an inner gear <b>226</b> to be close to the first ratchet ring <b>224</b>. A second ratchet ring <b>228</b> with a plurality of second ratchet recesses <b>227</b> is integrally formed at one side of the inner gear <b>226</b>. At this time, the hub driving body <b>216</b> is fixed to the inner peripheral surface of the hub shell <b>214</b> by means of a retaining ring <b>229</b>. The inner gear <b>226</b> and the second ratchet ring <b>228</b> are formed to be stepped. The first and second travel units <b>230</b> and <b>250</b> and the conversion unit <b>270</b> are arranged in the hub unit <b>210</b> constructed as above.</p>
  <p num="p-0041">The first travel unit <b>230</b> comprises a driver <b>232</b> and a driven sprocket <b>234</b>. The driver <b>232</b> closes the other side of the hub shell <b>214</b> while being rotatably secured on the hub shaft <b>212</b> by means of a second conical nut <b>236</b>. At this time, the driven sprocket <b>124</b> for receiving power from a driving sprocket (not shown) is mounted on an outer peripheral surface of the other side of the driver <b>232</b> which is exposed to the exterior of the hub shell <b>214</b>. An annular receiving recess <b>238</b> is formed inside the driver <b>232</b> on a side of the driver <b>232</b> extending toward the interior of the hub shell <b>214</b>. At the same time, a plurality of first pawls <b>240</b> selectively coming into close contact with the second ratchet recesses <b>227</b> of the second ratchet ring <b>228</b> of the hub driving body <b>216</b> to rotate the hub shell <b>214</b> are mounted on an outer peripheral surface of the receiving recess <b>238</b>, and a plurality of second pawls <b>242</b> are mounted on an inner peripheral surface of the receiving recess <b>238</b>. Preferably, the first and second pawls <b>240</b> and <b>242</b> resiliently protrude due to snap rings fitted into recesses formed at the centers thereof. When one-way rotational force is transmitted to the first and second pawls <b>240</b> and <b>242</b>, they can transmit the rotational force while maintaining their protruding states. On the contrary, when reverse rotational force is transmitted thereto, the first and second pawls <b>240</b> and <b>242</b> slide at the second ratchet recesses <b>227</b> and third ratchet recesses <b>276</b>, respectively, and resiliently enter recesses formed at outer and inner peripheral surfaces of the driver <b>232</b> so that they cannot transmit the rotational force.</p>
  <p num="p-0042">The second travel unit <b>250</b> comprises a first carrier <b>252</b>, and a second carrier <b>254</b> formed integrally with the first carrier <b>252</b>. The first carrier <b>252</b> is placed within the hub shell <b>214</b> while an inner peripheral surface of the first carrier encloses the sun gear <b>218</b>. An outer peripheral surface of the first carrier <b>252</b> is positioned to be close to the inner gear <b>226</b>. That is, the first carrier <b>252</b> takes the shape of a ring and is placed on the inner peripheral surface of the hub driving body <b>216</b>. A plurality of planet gears <b>256</b> are rotatably arranged in a radial direction on the outer peripheral surface of the first carrier <b>252</b>. Third pawls <b>258</b> selectively coming into close contact with the first ratchet recesses <b>222</b> of the first ratchet ring <b>224</b> are formed on the outer peripheral surface of the first carrier <b>252</b> on one side of the plurality of planetary gears <b>256</b>. A first spring coupling recess <b>260</b> is formed at a position in the other side surface of the first carrier <b>252</b> on the other side of the plurality of planetary gears <b>258</b>. At this time, radially inward portions of the outer peripheral surfaces of the planetary gears <b>256</b> are engaged with the sun gear <b>218</b>, and radially outward portions of the outer peripheral surfaces of the planetary gears <b>256</b> are engaged with the inner gear <b>226</b> of the hub driving body <b>216</b>. The second carrier <b>254</b> extends from the other side surface of the first carrier <b>252</b> toward the interior of the receiving recess <b>238</b> of the driver <b>232</b> while surrounding the hub shaft <b>212</b>. An annular guide <b>262</b> is formed at a distal end of the second carrier <b>254</b> to have a diameter smaller than that of the second carrier <b>254</b>. A first key protrusion <b>264</b> radially protrudes from a portion of the guide <b>262</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0043">Meanwhile, the conversion unit <b>270</b> comprises a third ratchet ring <b>272</b> and a conversion spring <b>274</b>. The plurality of third ratchet recesses <b>276</b> selectively coming into close contact with the third pawls <b>242</b> are formed on an outer peripheral surface of the third ratchet ring <b>272</b>, and an inner peripheral surface of the third ratchet ring is fitted around an outer peripheral surface of the second carrier <b>254</b>. At this time, the inner peripheral surface of the third ratchet ring <b>276</b> is formed with a second key protrusion <b>278</b> that selectively comes into close contact with the first key protrusion <b>264</b> while revolving along the guide <b>262</b>. A second spring coupling recess <b>280</b> is formed in one side surface of the third ratchet ring <b>272</b> to correspond to the first spring coupling recess <b>260</b>. Meanwhile, one end of the conversion spring <b>274</b> is mounted in the first spring coupling recess <b>260</b> and the other end thereof is mounted in the second spring coupling recess <b>280</b> so that the conversion spring can surround the second carrier <b>254</b>. That is, the second pawls <b>242</b> of the rotating driver <b>232</b> rotate the third ratchet ring <b>272</b>, and the second key protrusion <b>278</b> of the rotating third ratchet ring <b>272</b> revolves around the guide <b>262</b> and comes into close contact with the first key protrusion <b>264</b>, thereby rotating the second and first carriers <b>254</b> and <b>252</b>. As a result, the planetary gears <b>256</b> are engaged with the inner gear <b>226</b> about the sun gear <b>218</b>, and the third pawls <b>258</b> are engaged with the first ratchet ring <b>224</b>, thereby rapidly rotating the hub shell <b>214</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0044">The operation of the speed changing device <b>200</b> according to the second embodiment of the present invention constructed as above will be briefly described below.</p>
  <p num="p-0045">Pedals (not shown) of a bicycle are operated to drive the driving sprocket (not shown) that in turn rotates the driven sprocket <b>234</b> and the driver <b>232</b> connected thereto through a chain (not shown). When the driver <b>232</b> is rotated in such a manner, the first pawls <b>240</b> of the driver <b>232</b> come into close contact with the second ratchet recesses <b>227</b> of the second ratchet ring <b>228</b>, thereby rotating the hub driving body <b>216</b> on the inner peripheral surface of the hub shell <b>214</b>. Accordingly, the inner gear <b>226</b> formed integrally with the hub driving body <b>216</b> is rotated while being engaged with the outer peripheral surfaces of the planetary gears <b>256</b> of the first carrier <b>252</b>, thereby rotting the first carrier <b>252</b>. Thereafter, the third pawls <b>258</b> provided at the first carrier <b>252</b> rotate the hub shell <b>214</b>. Consequently, the bicycle travels at low speed.</p>
  <p num="p-0046">Meanwhile, while the first pawls <b>240</b> come into close contact with the second ratchet ring <b>228</b>, the second pawls <b>242</b> come into close contact with the third ratchet recesses <b>276</b> of the third ratchet ring <b>272</b>, thereby rotating the third ratchet ring <b>272</b>. When the third ratchet ring <b>272</b> is rotated in such a manner, the second key protrusion <b>278</b> formed on the inner peripheral surface of the third ratchet ring <b>272</b> revolves along the guide <b>262</b>, and the conversion spring <b>274</b> is compressed in one direction. At this time, the second key protrusion <b>278</b> revolving along the guide <b>262</b> rotates counterclockwise and then comes into close contact with the first key protrusion <b>264</b> to rotate the second and first carriers <b>254</b> and <b>252</b>. As the first carrier <b>252</b> is rotated in such a manner, the third pawls <b>258</b> provided at the first carrier <b>252</b> rotate the hub shell <b>214</b> more rapidly. At this time, the first pawls <b>240</b> slide at the second ratchet recesses <b>227</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0047">On the other hand, when the pedals are not operated or the bicycle is stopped, the rotation of the driven sprocket <b>234</b> and the driver <b>232</b> is stopped. Accordingly, the rotation of the third ratchet ring <b>272</b> is also stopped. At this time, the compressed conversion spring <b>274</b> is released to rotate the third ratchet ring <b>272</b> clockwise. The third ratchet ring <b>272</b> stops the high-speed rotation of the second and first carriers <b>254</b> and <b>252</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0048">In the first and second embodiments of the present invention described above, the first spring coupling recesses <b>158</b> and <b>260</b> and the second spring coupling recesses <b>180</b> and <b>280</b> for supporting the conversion springs <b>174</b> and <b>274</b> may be excluded as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0049">Here, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an exploded perspective view showing another example of the second travel unit and the conversion unit of the automatic speed changing device according to the first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0050">In the first embodiment, when the second ratchet ring <b>172</b> which has been rotated by the driven sprocket <b>134</b> and the driver <b>132</b> is stopped, the second carrier <b>154</b> is not immediately stopped but rotates due to inertial force without the conversion spring <b>174</b> for returning the second ratchet ring <b>172</b> to the initial position. Therefore, it is possible to obtain the same effects as the conversion into the low-speed travel state through the return to the initial state where the second ratchet ring <b>172</b> beings to be driven.</p>
  <p num="p-0051">However, in the second embodiment, when the third ratchet ring <b>272</b> which has been rotated by the driven sprocket <b>234</b> and the driver <b>232</b> is stopped, the high-speed travel state is continuously maintained in the absence of the conversion spring <b>274</b> for returning the third ratchet ring <b>272</b> to the initial position. Only when the rotation of the hub shell <b>214</b> is finally stopped, it is possible to obtain the same effects as the conversion into the low-speed travel state through the return to the initial state where the third ratchet ring <b>272</b> begins to be driven.</p>
  <p num="p-0052"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>7</b> <i>b </i>are views schematically showing another example of the low- and high-speed travel states of the automatic speed changing device of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0053">In the first embodiment of the present invention, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>7</b> <i>a </i>and <b>7</b> <i>b</i>, two or more first key protrusions <b>162</b> may be formed equidistantly on the outer peripheral surface of the second carrier <b>154</b>, and two or more second key protrusions <b>178</b> may be formed equidistantly on the inner peripheral surface of the second ratchet ring <b>172</b>. An annular bush <b>190</b> may be further provided between the outer peripheral surface of the second carrier <b>154</b> and the inner peripheral surface of the second ratchet ring <b>172</b>. The bush <b>190</b> has inner key protrusions <b>191</b> corresponding to the first key protrusions <b>162</b> and outer key protrusions <b>192</b> corresponding to the second key protrusions <b>178</b>, which are formed equidistantly on an inner peripheral surface and an outer peripheral surface of the bush, respectively.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">That is, in case of the low-speed travel state, the hub shell <b>114</b> is rotated by the plurality of first pawls <b>140</b>. On the contrary, in case of the high-speed travel state, the rotational force is transmitted only by the single second key protrusion <b>178</b> formed at the second ratchet ring <b>172</b> and the single first key protrusion <b>162</b> formed at the second carrier <b>154</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> <i>b</i>. Thus, since large rotational force is exerted on the first and second key protrusions <b>162</b> and <b>178</b>, the first and second key protrusions <b>162</b> and <b>178</b> are easily damaged.</p>
  <p num="p-0055">If two or more first and second key protrusions <b>162</b> and <b>178</b> are simply formed at the second carrier <b>154</b> and the second ratchet ring <b>172</b> in order to prevent such a phenomenon, speed changing timing is shortened to below about the half of that obtained in the case where the single first key protrusion <b>162</b> and the single second key protrusion <b>178</b> are formed.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">To overcome this, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 10</figref>, the bush <b>190</b>, which has the two inner key protrusions <b>191</b> on the inner peripheral surface to correspond to the first key protrusions <b>162</b> and the two outer key protrusions <b>192</b> on the outer peripheral surface to correspond to the second key protrusions <b>178</b>, is further provided between the outer peripheral surface of the second carrier <b>154</b> and the inner peripheral surface of the second ratchet ring <b>172</b>, so that the rotational force is distributed and then transmitted by the two or more first and second key protrusions <b>162</b> and <b>178</b>. Thus, damage to the first and second key protrusions <b>162</b> and <b>178</b> can be prevented in advance.</p>
  <p num="p-0057">In addition, it is possible to obtain an excellent advantage in that speed changing timing from the low-speed travel state to the high-speed travel state (i.e., the time when the second carrier begins to be rotated by the second ratchet ring) can be easily controlled by properly adjusting the intervals and numbers of the inner and outer key protrusions <b>191</b> and <b>192</b> formed at the bush <b>190</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0058">Similarly, even in the second embodiment of the present invention, two or more first key protrusions <b>264</b> may be formed equidistantly on the outer peripheral surface of the second carrier <b>254</b>, and two or more second key protrusions <b>278</b> may be formed equidistantly on the inner peripheral surface of the third ratchet ring <b>272</b>. An annular bush <b>190</b> may be further provided between the outer peripheral surface of the second carrier <b>254</b> and the inner peripheral surface of the third ratchet ring <b>272</b>. The bush <b>190</b> has inner key protrusions <b>191</b> corresponding to the first key protrusions <b>264</b> and outer key protrusions <b>192</b> corresponding to the second key protrusions <b>278</b>, which are formed equidistantly on an inner peripheral surface and an outer peripheral surface of the bush, respectively. Accordingly, it is possible to obtain the same effects as the first embodiment described above.</p>

  <p num="p-0060">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 12</figref>, the automatic speed changing device <b>300</b> according to the third embodiment of the present invention comprises a hub unit <b>310</b>, a first travel unit <b>330</b>, a second travel unit <b>350</b>, and a conversion unit <b>370</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">First, the hub unit <b>310</b> comprises a hub shaft <b>312</b> and a hub shell <b>314</b>. The hub shaft <b>312</b> has both ends supported by a frame (not shown) and is formed with an outer gear <b>324</b> in an intermediate portion thereof. The hub shaft <b>312</b> with the outer gear <b>324</b> formed as such is enclosed with the hub shell <b>314</b>. The hub shell <b>314</b> takes a shape with both open ends. One side of the hub shell <b>314</b> is rotatably secured on the hub shaft <b>312</b> by means of a first conical nut <b>318</b>. An inner peripheral surface of an intermediate portion of the hub shell <b>314</b> is integrally formed with a third ratchet ring <b>372</b> that has a plurality of third ratchet recesses <b>376</b> radially formed along the inner peripheral surface of the hub shell <b>314</b>. An inner peripheral surface of the other side of the hub shell <b>314</b> is formed with two or more second key protrusions <b>378</b> radially along the inner peripheral surface of the hub shell <b>314</b>. The first and second travel units <b>330</b> and <b>350</b> and the conversion unit <b>370</b> are arranged in the hub unit <b>310</b> constructed as above.</p>
  <p num="p-0062">The first travel unit <b>330</b> comprises a driver <b>332</b> and a driven sprocket <b>334</b>. The driver <b>332</b> closes the other side of the hub shell <b>314</b> while being rotatably secured on the hub shaft <b>312</b> by means of a second conical nut <b>336</b>. At this time, the driven sprocket <b>334</b> for receiving power from a driving sprocket (not shown) is mounted on an outer peripheral surface of the other side of the driver <b>332</b> which is exposed to the exterior of the hub shell <b>314</b>. A plurality of second pawls <b>342</b> selectively coming into close contact with second ratchet recesses <b>327</b> of a second ratchet ring <b>328</b> to rotate a ring gear <b>354</b> are mounted on an outer peripheral surface of the driver <b>332</b> extending into the hub shell <b>314</b>.

Preferably, the first and second pawls <b>340</b> and <b>342</b> resiliently protrude beyond the outer peripheral surface of the driver <b>332</b> due to snap rings fitted into recesses formed at the centers thereof. When one-way rotational force is transmitted to the first and second pawls <b>340</b> and <b>342</b>, the first pawls <b>340</b> and the second pawls <b>342</b> can transmit the rotational force to the driver <b>332</b> and the ring gear <b>354</b>, respectively, while maintaining their protruding states.

Two or more first key protrusions <b>364</b> are formed equidistantly on an outer peripheral surface of the other side of the ring gear <b>354</b>, and the bush <b>390</b> is fitted between the first and second key protrusions <b>364</b> and <b>378</b>. At this time, the bush <b>390</b> has inner key protrusions <b>391</b> corresponding to the first key protrusions <b>364</b> and outer key protrusions <b>392</b> corresponding to the second key protrusion <b>378</b>, which are formed equidistantly on an inner peripheral surface and an outer peripheral surface of the bush, respectively. As the first key protrusions <b>364</b> are rotated together with the ring gear <b>354</b>, the first key protrusions <b>364</b> rotates the inner key protrusions <b>391</b> of the bush <b>390</b>, resulting in a predetermined amount of rotation. Thereafter, the outer key protrusions <b>392</b> of the bush <b>390</b> rotate the second key protrusions <b>378</b>. As a result, the hub shell <b>314</b> is rotated at high speed.</p>
  <p num="p-0065">The operation of the speed changing device <b>300</b> according to the third embodiment of the present invention constructed as above will be briefly described below.</p>
  <p num="p-0066">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 12</figref>, pedals (not shown) of a bicycle are operated to drive the driving sprocket (not shown) that in turn rotates the driven sprocket <b>334</b> connected thereto through a chain (not shown). The first pawls <b>340</b> of the driver <b>332</b> come into close contact with the first ratchet recesses <b>322</b> formed at the first ratchet ring <b>324</b> of the driven sprocket <b>334</b>, thereby rotating the driver <b>332</b>. If reverse rotational force is transmitted to the driven sprocket <b>334</b> in such a state, the first pawls <b>340</b> slide at the first ratchet recesses <b>322</b> so that the reverse rotational force cannot be transmitted to the driver. When the driver <b>322</b> is rotated in such a manner, the second pawls <b>342</b> of the driver <b>332</b> come into close contact with the second ratchet recesses <b>327</b> of the second ratchet ring <b>328</b>, thereby rotating the ring gear <b>354</b>. Accordingly, the inner gear <b>326</b> of the ring gear <b>354</b> rotates the planetary gears <b>356</b> engaged with the outer gear <b>324</b> so that the carrier <b>352</b> is rotated about the hub shaft <b>312</b>. The third pawls <b>358</b> provided at the carrier <b>352</b> come into close contact with the third ratchet recesses <b>376</b> formed at the third ratchet ring <b>372</b> of the hub shell <b>314</b>, thereby rotating the hub shell <b>314</b>. Consequently, the bicycle travels at low speed.</p>
  <p num="p-0067">Meanwhile, as the ring gear <b>354</b> is rotated, the planetary gears <b>356</b> are rotated, and at the same time, the first key protrusions <b>364</b> formed at the ring gear <b>354</b> revolve unitarily. Accordingly, after the first key protrusions <b>364</b> revolve through a predetermined angle, they come into contact with the inner key protrusions <b>391</b> of the bush <b>390</b>, thereby rotating the bush <b>390</b>. After the first key protrusions <b>364</b> further continue to revolve through a predetermined angle together with the bush <b>390</b>, the outer key protrusions <b>378</b> of the bush <b>390</b> come into contact with the second key protrusions <b>378</b> of the hub shell <b>314</b>, thereby rapidly rotating the hub shell <b>314</b>. At this time, if the ring gear <b>354</b> rotates the hub shell <b>314</b> at high speed, the third pawls <b>358</b> slide at the third ratchet recesses <b>376</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0068">On the contrary, when the pedals are not operated, the rotation of the driven sprocket <b>334</b> and the driver <b>332</b> is stopped, whereas the hub shell <b>314</b> continues to rotate until the bicycle is stopped. Therefore, the bush <b>390</b> interposed between the first and second key protrusions <b>364</b> and <b>378</b> returns to the low-speed travel state that is a state prior to an initial driving state.</p>
  <p num="p-0069">At this time, by properly adjusting the intervals and numbers of the inner and outer key protrusions <b>391</b> and <b>392</b> formed at the bush <b>390</b>, it is possible to obtain excellent advantages in that large rotational force is prevented from being locally exerted on the first and second key protrusions <b>364</b> and <b>378</b> to prevent the occurrence of damage to parts, and that speed changing timing from the low-speed travel state to the high-speed travel state (i.e., the time when the hub shell begins to be rotated at high speed by the ring gear) can be easily controlled.</p>
  <p num="p-0070">Although the first to third embodiments of the present invention have been described in connection with a bicycle, they can also be easily applied to general machines, including wheelchairs, toy cars using pedals and fishing reels, or industrial machines as well as gas valves, locks and the like in which speed is changed.</p>
  <p num="p-0071">Therefore, the automatic speed changing device of the present invention can positively change speed using mechanical elements, such as a sun gear and planetary gears, and pawls and ratchets, according to a predetermined amount of rotation without additional manipulations. Since the speed changing timing can be easily controlled according to the numbers and positions of key protrusions formed at a bush, the automatic speed changing device of the present invention can be widely applied to and conveniently used in the whole field of power transmission mechanisms.</p>
  <p num="p-0072">As described above, the automatic speed changing devices according to the first to third embodiments of the present invention allow speed to be automatically changed during travel of a bicycle rather than conventional speed changing through manipulation of a lever. Therefore, there are advantages in that convenience of users can be maximized, and production costs can be reduced and maintenance thereof can be easily performed due to the simple structure thereof.</p>
  <p num="p-0073">Although the present invention has been described in connection with the preferred embodiments of the present invention, it will be readily understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications and changes can be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention defined by the appended claims.</p>
