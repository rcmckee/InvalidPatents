    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0004">Many fibers are formed from naturally occurring polymers. Various processing operations can be required to convert these polymers into fibers. In some instances, the resulting fibers can be referred to as regenerated fibers.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">An important class of regenerated fibers includes fibers formed from cellulose. Cellulose is a significant component of plant matter, such as, for example, leaves, wood, bark, and cotton. Conventionally, a solution spinning process is used to form fibers from cellulose. A wet solution spinning process is used to form rayon fibers and lyocell fibers, while a dry solution spinning process is used to form acetate fibers. Rayon fibers and lyocell fibers often include cellulose having the same chemical structure as naturally occurring cellulose. However, cellulose included in these fibers often has a shorter molecular chain length relative to naturally occurring cellulose. Acetate fibers often include a chemically modified form of cellulose in which various hydroxyl groups are replaced by acetyl groups.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">Fibers formed from cellulose find numerous applications. For example, these fibers can be used to form knitted, woven, or non-woven fabrics, which can be incorporated in products such as apparel or footwear. Fabrics formed from these fibers are generally perceived as comfort fabrics due to their ability to take up moisture and their low retention of body heat. These properties make the fabrics desirable in warm weather by allowing a wearer to feel cooler. However, these same properties can make the fabrics undesirable in cold weather. In cold and damp weather, the fabrics can be particularly undesirable due to rapid removal of body heat when the fabrics are wet.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">It is against this background that a need arose to develop the cellulosic fibers described herein.</p>

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading> <p num="p-0022">Embodiments of the invention relate to fibers having enhanced reversible thermal properties and methods of forming such fibers. In particular, various embodiments of the invention relate to cellulosic fibers including phase change materials. Cellulosic fibers in accordance with various embodiments of the invention have the ability to absorb and release thermal energy under different environmental conditions. In addition, the cellulosic fibers can exhibit improved processability (e.g., during formation of the cellulosic fibers or a product made therefrom), improved mechanical properties, improved containment of a phase change material within the cellulosic fibers, and higher loading levels of the phase change material.</p>
    <p num="p-0023">Cellulosic fibers in accordance with various embodiments of the invention can provide an improved level of comfort when incorporated in products such as, for example, apparel or footwear. In particular, the cellulosic fibers can provide such improved level of comfort under different environmental conditions. The use of phase change materials allows the cellulosic fibers to exhibit “dynamic” heat retention rather than “static” heat retention. Heat retention typically refers to the ability of a material to retain heat (e.g., body heat). A low level of heat retention is often desired in warm weather, while a high level of heat retention is often desired in cold weather. Unlike conventional fibers formed from cellulose, cellulosic fibers in accordance with various embodiments of the invention can exhibit different levels of heat retention under changing environmental conditions. For example, the cellulosic fibers can exhibit a low level of heat retention in warm weather and a high level of heat retention in cold weather, thus maintaining a desired level of comfort under changing weather conditions.</p>
    <p num="p-0024">In conjunction with exhibiting “dynamic” heat retention, cellulosic fibers in accordance with various embodiments of the invention can exhibit a high level of moisture absorbency. Moisture absorbency typically refers to the ability of a material to absorb or take up moisture. In some instances, moisture absorbency can be expressed as a percentage weight gain resulting from absorbed moisture relative to a moisture-free weight of the material under a particular environmental condition (e.g., 21° C. and 65 percent relative humidity). Cellulosic fibers in accordance with various embodiments of the invention can exhibit moisture absorbency of at least 5 percent, such as, for example, from about 6 percent to about 15 percent, from about 6 percent to about 13 percent, or from about 11 percent to about 13 percent. A high level of moisture absorbency can serve to reduce the amount of skin moisture, such as, for example, due to perspiration. In addition, moisture absorbed by cellulosic fibers can enhance the heat conductivity of the cellulosic fibers. Thus, for example, when incorporated in apparel or footwear, the cellulosic fibers can serve to reduce the amount of skin moisture as well as lower skin temperature, thereby providing a higher level of comfort in warm weather. The use of phase change materials in the cellulosic fibers further enhances the level of comfort by absorbing or releasing thermal energy to maintain a comfortable skin temperature.</p>
    <p num="p-0025">A cellulosic fiber according to some embodiments of the invention can include a set of elongated members. As used herein, the term “set” refers to a collection of one or more elements. In some instances, the cellulosic fiber can include a fiber body formed of the set of elongated members. The fiber body is typically elongated and can have a length that is several times (e.g., 100 times or more) greater than its diameter. The fiber body can have any of various regular or irregular cross-sectional shapes, such as, for example, circular, indented, flower petal-shaped, multi-lobal, octagonal, oval, pentagonal, rectangular, serrated, square-shaped, trapezoidal, triangular, wedge-shaped, and so forth. Various elongated members of the set of elongated members can be coupled (e.g., bonded, combined, joined, or united) to one another to form a unitary fiber body.</p>
    <p num="p-0026">According to some embodiments of the invention, a cellulosic fiber can be formed of at least one elongated member that includes a temperature regulating material. Typically, the temperature regulating material includes one or more phase change materials to provide the cellulosic fiber with enhanced reversible thermal properties. For certain applications, a cellulosic fiber can be formed of various elongated members that can include the same cellulosic material or different cellulosic materials, and at least one elongated member has a temperature regulating material dispersed therein. It is contemplated that one or more elongated members can be formed from various other types of polymeric materials. Typically, the temperature regulating material is substantially uniformly dispersed within at least one elongated member. However, depending upon the particular characteristics desired for the cellulosic fiber, the dispersion of the temperature regulating material can be varied within one or more elongated members. Various elongated members can include the same temperature regulating material or different temperature regulating materials.</p>
    <p num="p-0027">Depending upon the particular application, a set of elongated members forming a cellulosic fiber can be arranged in one of various configurations. For example, the set of elongated members can include various elongated members arranged in a core-sheath configuration or an island-in-sea configuration. The elongated members can be arranged in other configurations, such as, for example, a matrix or checkerboard configuration, a segmented-pie configuration, a side-by-side configuration, a striped configuration, and so forth. In some instances, the elongated members can be arranged in a bundle form in which the elongated members are generally parallel with respect to one another. One or more elongated members can extend through at least a portion of a length of a fiber body, and, in some instances, the elongated members can be longitudinally co-extensive. For example, the cellulosic fiber can include an inner member that substantially extends through the length of the cellulosic fiber and includes a temperature regulating material. The extent to which the inner member extends through the cellulosic fiber can depend upon, for example, desired thermal regulating properties for the cellulosic fiber. In addition, other factors (e.g., desired mechanical properties or method of forming the cellulosic fiber) can play a role in determining this extent. Thus, in some instances, the inner member can extend through from about a half up to the entire length of the cellulosic fiber to provide desired thermal regulating properties. An outer member can surround the inner member and form an exterior of the cellulosic fiber.</p>
    <p num="p-0028">According to some embodiments of the invention, a cellulosic fiber can be between about 0.1 to about 1000 denier or between about 0.1 to about 100 denier. Typically, a cellulosic fiber according to some embodiments of the invention is between about 0.5 to about 15 denier, such as, for example, between about 1 to about 15 denier or between about 0.5 to about 10 denier. As one of ordinary skill in the art will understand, a denier typically refers to a measure of weight per unit length of a fiber and represents the number of grams per 9000 meters of the fiber.</p>
    <p num="p-0029">If desired, a cellulosic fiber according to some embodiments of the invention can be further processed to form one or more smaller denier fibers. For example, various elongated members forming the cellulosic fiber can be split apart or fibrillated to form two or more smaller denier fibers, and each smaller denier fiber can include one or more elongated members. It is contemplated that one or more elongated members (or a portion or portions thereof) forming the cellulosic fiber can be mechanically separated, pneumatically separated, dissolved, melted, or otherwise removed to yield one or more smaller denier fibers. Typically, at least one resulting smaller denier fiber includes a temperature regulating material to provide desired thermal regulating properties.</p>
    <p num="p-0030">Depending upon the particular application, a cellulosic fiber can also include one or more additives. An additive can be dispersed within one or more elongated members forming the cellulosic fiber. Examples of additives include water, surfactants, dispersants, anti-foam agents (e.g., silicone containing compounds and fluorine containing compounds), antioxidants (e.g., hindered phenols and phosphites), thermal stabilizers (e.g., phosphites, organophosphorous compounds, metal salts of organic carboxylic acids, and phenolic compounds), light or UV stabilizers (e.g., hydroxy benzoates, hindered hydroxy benzoates, and hindered amines), microwave absorbing additives (e.g., multifunctional primary alcohols, glycerine, and carbon), reinforcing fibers (e.g., carbon fibers, aramid fibers, and glass fibers), conductive fibers or particles (e.g., graphite or activated carbon fibers or particles), lubricants, process aids (e.g., metal salts of fatty acids, fatty acid esters, fatty acid ethers, fatty acid amides, sulfonamides, polysiloxanes, organophosphorous compounds, silicon containing compounds, fluorine containing compounds, and phenolic polyethers), fire retardants (e.g., halogenated compounds, phosphorous compounds, organophosphates, organobromides, alumina trihydrate, melamine derivatives, magnesium hydroxide, antimony compounds, antimony oxide, and boron compounds), anti-blocking additives (e.g., silica, talc, zeolites, metal carbonates, and organic polymers), anti-fogging additives (e.g., non-ionic surfactants, glycerol esters, polyglycerol esters, sorbitan esters and their ethoxylates, nonyl phenyl ethoxylates, and alcohol ethyoxylates), anti-static additives (e.g., non-ionics such as fatty acid esters, ethoxylated alkylamines, diethanolamides, and ethoxylated alcohol; anionics such as alkylsulfonates and alkylphosphates; cationics such as metal salts of chlorides, methosulfates or nitrates, and quaternary ammonium compounds; and amphoterics such as alkylbetaines), anti-microbials (e.g., arsenic compounds, sulfur, copper compounds, isothiazolins phthalamides, carbamates, silver base inorganic agents, silver zinc zeolites, silver copper zeolites, silver zeolites, metal oxides, and silicates), crosslinkers or controlled degradation agents (e.g., peroxides, azo compounds, silanes, isocyanates, and epoxies), colorants, pigments, dyes, fluorescent whitening agents or optical brighteners (e.g., bis-benzoxazoles, phenylcoumarins, and bis-(styryl)biphenyls), fillers (e.g., natural minerals and metals such as oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, sulfates, and silicates; talc; clay; wollastonite; graphite; carbon black; carbon fibers; glass fibers and beads; ceramic fibers and beads; metal fibers and beads; flours; and fibers of natural or synthetic origin such as fibers of wood, starch, or cellulose flours), coupling agents (e.g., silanes, titanates, zirconates, fatty acid salts, anhydrides, epoxies, and unsaturated polymeric acids), reinforcement agents, crystallization or nucleation agents (e.g., any material which increases or improves the crystallinity of a polymer, such as to improve rate or kinetics of crystal growth, number of crystals grown, or types of crystals grown), and so forth.</p>
    <p num="p-0031">According to some embodiments of the invention, certain treatments or coatings can be applied to a cellulosic fiber to impart additional properties such as, for example, stain resistance, water repellency, softer feel, and moisture management properties. Examples of treatments and coatings include Epic (available from Nextec Applications Inc., Vista, Calif.), Intera (available from Intera Technologies, Inc., Chattanooga, Tenn.), Zonyl Fabric Protectors (available from DuPont Inc., Wilmington, Del.), Scotchgard (available from 3M Co., Maplewood, Minn.), and so forth.</p>
    <p num="p-0032">The foregoing discussion provides a general overview of some embodiments of the invention. Attention now turns to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which illustrates a three-dimensional view of a cellulosic fiber <b>1</b> according to an embodiment of the invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0033">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the cellulosic fiber <b>1</b> is a mono-component fiber that includes a single elongated member <b>2</b>. The elongated member <b>2</b> is generally cylindrical and includes a cellulosic material <b>3</b> and a temperature regulating material <b>4</b> dispersed within the cellulosic material <b>3</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the temperature regulating material <b>4</b> can include various microcapsules containing a phase change material, and the microcapsules can be substantially uniformly dispersed throughout the elongated member <b>2</b>. While it may be desirable to have the microcapsules uniformly dispersed within the elongated member <b>2</b>, such configuration is not necessary in all applications. The cellulosic fiber <b>1</b> can include various percentages by weight of the cellulosic material <b>3</b> and the temperature regulating material <b>4</b> to provide desired thermal regulating properties, mechanical properties (e.g., ductility, tensile strength, and hardness), and moisture absorbency.</p>
    <p num="p-0034"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a three-dimensional view of another cellulosic fiber <b>5</b> according to an embodiment of the invention. As discussed for the cellulosic fiber <b>1</b>, the cellulosic fiber <b>5</b> is a mono-component fiber that includes a single elongated member <b>6</b>. The elongated member <b>6</b> is generally cylindrical and includes a cellulosic material <b>7</b> and a temperature regulating material <b>8</b> dispersed within the cellulosic material <b>7</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the temperature regulating material <b>8</b> can include a phase change material in a raw form (e.g., the phase change material is non-encapsulated, i.e., not micro- or macroencapsulated), and the phase change material can be substantially uniformly dispersed throughout the elongated member <b>6</b>. While it may be desirable to have the phase change material uniformly dispersed within the elongated member <b>6</b>, such configuration is not necessary in all applications. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the phase change material can form distinct domains that are dispersed within the elongated member <b>6</b>. The cellulosic fiber <b>5</b> can include various percentages by weight of the cellulosic material <b>7</b> and the temperature regulating material <b>8</b> to provide desired thermal regulating properties, mechanical properties, and moisture absorbency.</p>
    <p num="p-0035">Turning next to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, cross-sectional views of various cellulosic fibers <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>29</b>, and <b>34</b> are illustrated, according to an embodiment of the invention. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each cellulosic fiber (e.g., the cellulosic fiber <b>21</b>) is a multi-component component fiber that includes various distinct cross-sectional regions. These cross-sectional regions correspond to various elongated members (e.g., elongated members <b>39</b> and <b>40</b>) that form each cellulosic fiber.</p>
    <p num="p-0036">In the illustrated embodiment, each cellulosic fiber includes a first set of elongated members (shown shaded in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and a second set of elongated members (shown unshaded in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Here, the first set of elongated members can be formed from a cellulosic material that has a temperature regulating material dispersed therein. The second set of elongated members can be formed from the same cellulosic material or another cellulosic material having somewhat different properties. In general, various elongated members of the first set of elongated members can be formed from the same cellulosic material or different cellulosic materials. Similarly, various elongated members of the second set of elongated members can be formed from the same cellulosic material or different cellulosic materials. It is contemplated that one or more elongated members can be formed from various other types of polymeric materials.</p>
    <p num="p-0037">For certain applications, a temperature regulating material can be dispersed within a second set of elongated members. Different temperature regulating materials can be dispersed within the same elongated member or different elongated members. For example, a first temperature regulating material can be dispersed within a first set of elongated members, and a second temperature regulating material having somewhat different properties can be dispersed within a second set of elongated members. It is contemplated that one or more elongated members can be formed from a temperature regulating material that need not be dispersed within a cellulosic material or other polymeric material. For example, the temperature regulating material can include a polymeric phase change material that provides enhanced reversible thermal properties and that can be used to form a first set of elongated members. In this case, it may be desirable, but not required, that a second set of elongated members adequately surround the first set of elongated members to reduce or prevent loss or leakage of the temperature regulating material. Various elongated members can be formed from the same polymeric phase change material or different polymeric phase change materials.</p>
    <p num="p-0038">In the illustrated embodiment, each cellulosic fiber can include various percentages by weight of a first set of elongated members that include a temperature regulating material relative to a second set of elongated members. For example, when thermal regulating properties of a cellulosic fiber are a controlling consideration, a larger proportion of the cellulosic fiber can include a first set of elongated members that include a temperature regulating material. On the other hand, when mechanical properties and moisture absorbency of the cellulosic fiber are a controlling consideration, a larger proportion of the cellulosic fiber can include a second set of elongated members that need not include the temperature regulating material. Alternatively, when balancing thermal regulating properties and other properties of the cellulosic fiber, it can be desirable that the second set of elongated members include the same or a different temperature regulating material.</p>
    <p num="p-0039">For example, a cellulosic fiber in the illustrated embodiment can include from about 1 percent to about 99 percent by weight of a first set of elongated members. Typically, the cellulosic fiber includes from about 10 percent to about 90 percent by weight of the first set of elongated members. As an example, a cellulosic fiber can include 90 percent by weight of a first elongated member and 10 percent by weight of a second elongated member. For this example, the first elongated member can include 60 percent by weight of a temperature regulating material, such that the cellulosic fiber includes 54 percent by weight of the temperature regulating material. As another example, the cellulosic fiber can include up to about 50 percent by weight of the first elongated member, which in turn can include up to about 50 percent by weight of the temperature regulating material. Such weight percentages provide the cellulosic fiber with up to about 25 percent by weight of the temperature regulating material and provide effective thermal regulating properties, mechanical properties, and moisture absorbency for the cellulosic fiber. It is contemplated that a percentage by weight of an elongated member relative to a total weight of a cellulosic fiber can be varied, for example, by adjusting a cross-sectional area of the elongated member or by adjusting the extent to which the elongated member extends through a length of the cellulosic fiber.</p>
    <p num="p-0040">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, left-hand column <b>10</b> illustrates three cellulosic fibers <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, and <b>14</b>. The cellulosic fiber <b>12</b> includes various elongated members arranged in a segmented-pie configuration. In the illustrated embodiment, a first set of elongated members <b>15</b>, <b>15</b>′, <b>15</b>″, <b>15</b>′″, and <b>15</b>″″ and a second set of elongated members <b>16</b>, <b>16</b>′, <b>16</b>″, <b>16</b>′″, and <b>16</b>″″ are arranged in an alternating fashion and have cross-sections that are wedge-shaped. In general, the elongated members can have cross-sectional shapes and areas that are the same or different. While the cellulosic fiber <b>12</b> is illustrated with ten elongated members, it is contemplated that, in general, two or more elongated members can be arranged in a segmented-pie configuration, and at least one of the elongated members typically will include a temperature regulating material.</p>
    <p num="p-0041">The cellulosic fiber <b>13</b> includes various elongated members arranged in an island-in-sea configuration. In the illustrated embodiment, a first set of elongated members (e.g., elongated members <b>35</b>, <b>35</b>′, <b>35</b>″, and <b>35</b>′″) are positioned within and surrounded by a second elongated member <b>36</b>, thereby forming “islands” within a “sea.” Such configuration can serve to provide a more uniform distribution of a temperature regulating material within the cellulosic fiber <b>13</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the first set of elongated members have cross-sections that are trapezoidal. In general, the first set of elongated members can have cross-sectional shapes and areas that are the same or different. While the cellulosic fiber <b>13</b> is illustrated with seventeen elongated members positioned within and surrounded by the second elongated member <b>36</b>, it is contemplated that, in general, one or more elongated members can be positioned within and surrounded by the second elongated member <b>36</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0042">The cellulosic fiber <b>14</b> includes various elongated members arranged in a striped configuration. In the illustrated embodiment, a first set of elongated members <b>37</b>, <b>37</b>′, <b>37</b>″, <b>37</b>′″, and <b>37</b>″″ and a second set of elongated members <b>38</b>, <b>38</b>′, <b>38</b>″, and <b>38</b>′″ are arranged in an alternating fashion and are shaped as longitudinal slices of the cellulosic fiber <b>14</b>. In general, the elongated members can have cross-sectional shapes and areas that are the same or different. The cellulosic fiber <b>14</b> can be a self-crimping or self-texturing fiber and can impart loft, bulk, insulation, stretch, or other like properties. While the cellulosic fiber <b>14</b> is illustrated with nine elongated members, it is contemplated that, in general, two or more elongated members can be arranged in a striped configuration, and at least one of the elongated members typically will include a temperature regulating material.</p>
    <p num="p-0043">For the cellulosic fibers <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, one or more elongated members (e.g., the elongated member <b>15</b>) of a first set of elongated members can be partially surrounded by one or more adjacent elongated members (e.g., the elongated members <b>16</b> and <b>16</b>″″). When an elongated member including a phase change material is not completely surrounded, it may be desirable, but not required, that a containment structure (e.g., microcapsules) is used to contain the phase change material dispersed within the elongated member. In some instances, the cellulosic fibers <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, and <b>14</b> can be further processed to form one or more smaller denier fibers. Thus, for example, the elongated members forming the cellulosic fiber <b>12</b> can be split apart, or one or more elongated members (or a portion or portions thereof) can be dissolved, melted, or otherwise removed. A resulting smaller denier fiber can include, for example, the elongated members <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> coupled to one another.</p>

    <p num="p-0045">The cellulosic fiber <b>21</b> includes a first elongated member <b>39</b> positioned within and surrounded by a second elongated member <b>40</b>.

Here, the first elongated member <b>43</b> is formed as a core member that is eccentrically positioned within the second elongated member <b>44</b> that is formed as a sheath member. The cellulosic fiber <b>23</b> can include various percentages by weight of the core member and the sheath member to provide desired thermal regulating properties, mechanical properties, and moisture absorbency.</p>
    <p num="p-0048">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the cellulosic fiber <b>24</b> includes a first elongated member <b>45</b> positioned within and surrounded by a second elongated member <b>46</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the first elongated member <b>45</b> is formed as a core member that has a tri-lobal cross-sectional shape. This core member is concentrically positioned within the second elongated member <b>46</b> that is formed as a sheath member. The cellulosic fiber <b>24</b> can include various percentages by weight of the core member and the sheath member to provide desired thermal regulating properties, mechanical properties, and moisture absorbency.</p>
    <p num="p-0049">It is contemplated that, in general, a core member can have any of various regular or irregular cross-sectional shapes, such as, for example, circular, indented, flower petal-shaped, multi-lobal, octagonal, oval, pentagonal, rectangular, serrated, square-shaped, trapezoidal, triangular, wedge-shaped, and so forth. While the cellulosic fibers <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, and <b>24</b> are each illustrated with one core member positioned within and surrounded by a sheath member, it is contemplated that two or more core members can be positioned within and surrounded by a sheath member (e.g., in a manner similar to that illustrated for the cellulosic fiber <b>13</b>). These two or more core members can have cross-sectional shapes and areas that are the same or different. It is also contemplated that a cellulosic fiber can include three or more elongated members arranged in a core-sheath configuration, such that the elongated members are shaped as concentric or eccentric longitudinal slices of the cellulosic fiber. Thus, for example, the cellulosic fiber can include a core member positioned within and surrounded by a sheath member, which, in turn, is positioned within and surrounded by another sheath member.</p>
    <p num="p-0050">Right-hand column <b>30</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates five cellulosic fibers <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>29</b>, and <b>34</b>. In particular, the cellulosic fibers <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>29</b>, and <b>34</b> each includes various elongated members arranged in a side-by-side configuration.</p>
    <p num="p-0051">The cellulosic fiber <b>26</b> includes a first elongated member <b>47</b> positioned adjacent to and partially surrounded by a second elongated member <b>48</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the elongated members <b>47</b> and <b>48</b> have half-circular cross-sectional shapes. Here, the cellulosic fiber <b>26</b> can include about 50 percent by weight of the first elongated member <b>47</b> and about 50 percent by weight of the second elongated member <b>48</b>. The elongated members <b>47</b> and <b>48</b> also can be characterized as being arranged in a segmented-pie or a striped configuration.</p>
    <p num="p-0052">As discussed for the cellulosic fiber <b>26</b>, the cellulosic fiber <b>27</b> includes a first elongated member <b>49</b> positioned adjacent to and partially surrounded by a second elongated member <b>50</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the cellulosic fiber <b>27</b> can include about 20 percent by weight of the first elongated member <b>49</b> and about 80 percent by weight of the second elongated member <b>50</b>. The elongated members <b>49</b> and <b>50</b> also can be characterized as being arranged in a core-sheath configuration, such that the first elongated member <b>49</b> is eccentrically positioned with respect to and partially surrounded by the second elongated member <b>50</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0053">The cellulosic fibers <b>28</b> and <b>29</b> are examples of mixed-viscosity fibers. The cellulosic fibers <b>28</b> and <b>29</b> each includes a first elongated member <b>51</b> or <b>53</b> that has a temperature regulating material dispersed therein and is positioned adjacent to and partially surrounded by a second elongated member <b>52</b> or <b>54</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0054">A mixed-viscosity fiber can be considered to be a self-crimping or self-texturing fiber, such that the fiber's crimping or texturing can impart loft, bulk, insulation, stretch, or other like properties. Typically, a mixed-viscosity fiber includes various elongated members that are formed from different polymeric materials. The different polymeric materials used to form the mixed-viscosity fiber can include polymers with different viscosities, chemical structures, or molecular weights. When the mixed-viscosity fiber is drawn, uneven stresses can be created between various elongated members, and the mixed-viscosity fiber can crimp or bend. In some instances, the different polymeric materials used to form the mixed-viscosity fiber can include polymers having different degrees of crystallinity. For example, a first polymeric material used to form a first elongated member can have a lower degree of crystallinity than a second polymeric material used to form a second elongated member. When the mixed-viscosity fiber is drawn, the first and second polymeric materials can undergo different degrees of crystallization to “lock” an orientation and strength into the mixed-viscosity fiber. A sufficient degree of crystallization can be desired to prevent or reduce reorientation of the mixed-viscosity fiber during subsequent processing (e.g., heat treatment).</p>
    <p num="p-0055">For example, for the cellulosic fiber <b>28</b>, the first elongated member <b>51</b> can be formed from a first cellulosic material, and the second elongated member <b>52</b> can be formed from a second cellulosic material having somewhat different properties. It is contemplated that the first elongated member <b>51</b> and the second elongated member <b>52</b> can be formed from the same cellulosic material, and a temperature regulating material can be dispersed within the first elongated member <b>51</b> to impart self-crimping or self-texturing properties to the cellulosic fiber <b>28</b>.

    <p num="p-0064">As discussed previously, a cellulosic fiber according to some embodiments of the invention can include one or more temperature regulating materials. A temperature regulating material typically includes one or more phase change materials. In general, a phase change material can be any substance (or any mixture of substances) that has the capability of absorbing or releasing thermal energy to reduce or eliminate heat flow within a temperature stabilizing range. The temperature stabilizing range can include a particular transition temperature or a particular range of transition temperatures. A phase change material used in conjunction with various embodiments of the invention typically is capable of inhibiting a flow of thermal energy during a time when the phase change material is absorbing or releasing heat, typically as the phase change material undergoes a transition between two states (e.g., liquid and solid states, liquid and gaseous states, solid and gaseous states, or two solid states). This action is typically transient. In some instances, a phase change material can effectively inhibit a flow of thermal energy until a latent heat of the phase change material is absorbed or released during a heating or cooling process. Thermal energy can be stored or removed from a phase change material, and the phase change material typically can be effectively recharged by a source of heat or cold. By selecting an appropriate phase change material, a cellulosic fiber can be designed for use in any of various products.</p>
    <p num="p-0065">For certain applications, a phase change material can be a solid/solid phase change material. A solid/solid phase change material is a type of phase change material that undergoes a transition between two solid states (e.g., a crystalline or mesocrystalline phase transformation) and hence typically does not become a liquid during use.</p>
    <p num="p-0066">A phase change material can include a mixture of two or more substances. By selecting two or more different substances and forming a mixture, a temperature stabilizing range can be adjusted over a wide range for any particular application of a cellulosic fiber. In some instances, a mixture of two or more different substances can exhibit two or more distinct transition temperatures or a single modified transition temperature when incorporated in a cellulosic fiber.</p>
    <p num="p-0067">Phase change materials that can be used in conjunction with various embodiments of the invention include various organic and inorganic substances. Examples of phase change materials include hydrocarbons (e.g., straight-chain alkanes or paraffinic hydrocarbons, branched-chain alkanes, unsaturated hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, and alicyclic hydrocarbons), hydrated salts (e.g., calcium chloride hexahydrate, calcium bromide hexahydrate, magnesium nitrate hexahydrate, lithium nitrate trihydrate, potassium fluoride tetrahydrate, ammonium alum, magnesium chloride hexahydrate, sodium carbonate decahydrate, disodium phosphate dodecahydrate, sodium sulfate decahydrate, and sodium acetate trihydrate), waxes, oils, water, fatty acids, fatty acid esters, dibasic acids, dibasic esters, 1-halides, primary alcohols, secondary alcohols, tertiary alcohols, aromatic compounds, clathrates, semi-clathrates, gas clathrates, anhydrides (e.g., stearic anhydride), ethylene carbonate, polyhydric alcohols (e.g., 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propanediol, 2-hydroxymethyl-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol, pentaglycerine, tetramethylol ethane, neopentyl glycol, tetramethylol propane, 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol, monoaminopentaerythritol, diaminopentaerythritol, and tris(hydroxymethyl)acetic acid), polymers (e.g., polyethylene, polyethylene glycol, polyethylene oxide, polypropylene, polypropylene glycol, polytetramethylene glycol, polypropylene malonate, polyneopentyl glycol sebacate, polypentane glutarate, polyvinyl myristate, polyvinyl stearate, polyvinyl laurate, polyhexadecyl methacrylate, polyoctadecyl methacrylate, polyesters produced by polycondensation of glycols (or their derivatives) with diacids (or their derivatives), and copolymers, such as polyacrylate or poly(meth)acrylate with alkyl hydrocarbon side chain or with polyethylene glycol side chain and copolymers including polyethylene, polyethylene glycol, polyethylene oxide, polypropylene, polypropylene glycol, or polytetramethylene glycol), metals, and mixtures thereof.</p>
    <p num="p-0068">The selection of a phase change material is typically dependent upon a desired transition temperature or a desired application of a cellulosic fiber that includes the phase change material. For example, a phase change material having a transition temperature near room temperature or normal body temperature can be desirable for clothing applications. In particular, cellulosic fibers including such phase change material can be incorporated into apparel or footwear to maintain a comfortable skin temperature for a user.</p>
    <p num="p-0069">A phase change material according to some embodiments of the invention can have a transition temperature in the range of about −5° C. to about 125° C. For clothing applications, a phase change material typically has a transition temperature in the range of about 0° C. to about 50° C., such as, for example, from about 15° C. to about 45° C., from about 22° C. to about 40° C., or from about 22° C. to about 28° C.</p>
    <p num="p-0070">Particularly useful phase change materials include paraffinic hydrocarbons having from 10 to 44 carbon atoms (i.e., C<sub>10</sub>-C<sub>44 </sub>paraffinic hydrocarbons). Table 1 sets forth a list of C<sub>13</sub>-C<sub>28 </sub>paraffinic hydrocarbons that can be used as phase change materials in the cellulosic fibers described herein. The number of carbon atoms of a paraffinic hydrocarbon typically correlates with its melting point. For example, n-Octacosane, which includes 28 straight-chain carbon atoms per molecule, has a melting point of about 61.4° C. By comparison, n-Tridecane, which includes 13 straight-chain carbon atoms per molecule, has a melting point of about −5.5° C. n-Octadecane, which includes 18 straight-chain carbon atoms per molecule and has a melting point of about 28.2° C., can be particularly desirable for clothing applications.</p>

    <p num="p-0072">Other useful phase change materials include polymeric phase change materials having transition temperatures suitable for a desired application of the resulting cellulosic fibers. Thus, for clothing applications, a polymeric phase change material can have a transition temperature in the range of about 0° C. to about 50° C., such as, for example, from about 22° C. to about 40° C.</p>
    <p num="p-0073">A polymeric phase change material can include a polymer (or a mixture of polymers) having any of various chain structures and including one or more types of monomer units. In particular, a polymeric phase change material can include a linear polymer, a branched polymer (e.g., a star-branched polymer, a comb-branched polymer, or a dendritic-branched polymer), or a mixture thereof. For certain applications, a polymeric phase change material desirably includes a linear polymer or a polymer with a small amount of branching to allow for a greater density and a greater degree of ordered molecular packing and crystallization. Such greater degree of ordered molecular packing and crystallization can lead to a larger latent heat and a narrower temperature stabilizing range (e.g., a well-defined transition temperature). A polymeric phase change material can include a homopolymer, a copolymer (e.g., a terpolymer, a statistical copolymer, a random copolymer, an alternating copolymer, a periodic copolymer, a block copolymer, a radial copolymer, or a graft copolymer), or a mixture thereof. Properties of one or more types of monomer units forming a polymeric phase change material can affect a transition temperature of the polymeric phase change material. Accordingly, the selection of the monomer units can be dependent upon a desired transition temperature or a desired application of cellulosic fibers that include the polymeric phase change material. As one of ordinary skill in the art will understand, the reactivity and functionality of a polymer can be altered by addition or replacement of one or more functional groups, such as, for example, amines, amides, carboxyls, hydroxyls, esters, ethers, epoxides, anhydrides, isocyanates, silanes, ketones, aldehydes, and so forth. Also, a polymeric phase change material can include a polymer capable of crosslinking, entanglement, or hydrogen bonding in order to increase toughness or resistance to heat, moisture, or chemicals.</p>
    <p num="p-0074">As one of ordinary skill in the art will understand, some polymers can be provided in various forms having different molecular weights, since a molecular weight of a polymer can be determined by processing conditions used for forming the polymer. Accordingly, a polymeric phase change material can include a polymer (or a mixture of polymers) having a particular molecular weight or a particular range of molecular weights. As used herein, the term “molecular weight” can refer to a number average molecular weight or a weight average molecular weight of a polymer (or a mixture of polymers).</p>
    <p num="p-0075">For certain applications, a polymeric phase change material can be desirable as a result of having a higher molecular weight, larger molecular size, and higher viscosity relative to non-polymeric phase change materials such as, for example, paraffinic hydrocarbons. As a result of such properties, a polymeric phase change material can exhibit a lesser tendency to leak from a cellulosic fiber during fiber formation or during end use. For some embodiments of the invention, a polymeric phase change material can include polymers having a number average molecular weight in the range of about 400 to about 5,000,000, such as, for example, from about 2,000 to about 5,000,000, from about 8,000 to about 100,000, or from about 8,000 to about 15,000. As one of ordinary skill in the art will understand, a higher molecular weight for a polymer is typically associated with a lower acid number for the polymer. When incorporated within a cellulosic fiber having a core-sheath or island-in-sea configuration, a higher molecular weight or higher viscosity can serve to prevent a polymeric phase change material from flowing through a sheath member or a sea member forming an exterior of the cellulosic fiber. In addition to providing thermal regulating properties, a polymeric phase change material can provide improved mechanical properties when incorporated in cellulosic fibers in accordance with various embodiments of the invention. In some instances, a polymeric phase change material having a desired transition temperature can be mixed with a cellulosic material or,other polymeric material to form an elongated member. In other instances, a polymeric phase change material can provide adequate mechanical properties, such that it can be used to form an elongated member without requiring a cellulosic material or other polymeric material. Such configuration can allow for a higher loading level of the polymeric phase change material and improved thermal regulating properties.</p>
    <p num="p-0076">For example, polyethylene glycols can be used as phase change materials in some embodiments of the invention. The number average molecular weight of a polyethylene glycol typically correlates with its melting point. For example, polyethylene glycols having a number average molecular weight in the range of about 570 to about 630 (e.g., Carbowax™ 600, available from The Dow Chemical Company, Midland, Mich.) typically have a melting point in the range of about 20° C. to about 25° C., making them desirable for clothing applications. Other polyethylene glycols that can be useful at other temperature stabilizing ranges include polyethylene glycols having a number average molecular weight of about 400 and a melting point in the range of about 4° C. to about 8° C., polyethylene glycols having a number average molecular weight in the range of about 1,000 to about 1,500 and a melting point in the range of about 42° C. to about 48° C., and polyethylene glycols having a number average molecular weight of about 6,000 and a melting point in the range of about 56° C. to about 63° C. (e.g., Carbowax™ 400, 1500, and 6000, available from The Dow Chemical Company, Midland, Mich.).</p>
    <p num="p-0077">Additional useful phase change materials include polymeric phase change materials based on polyethylene glycols that are endcapped with fatty acids. For example, polyethylene glycol fatty acid diesters having a melting point in the range of about 22° C. to about 35° C. can be formed from polyethylene glycols having a number average molecular weight in the range of about 400 to about 600 that are endcapped with stearic acid or lauric acid. Further useful phase change materials include polymeric phase change materials based on tetramethylene glycol. For example, polytetramethylene glycols having a number average molecular weight in the range of about 1,000 to about 1,800 (e.g., Terathane® 1000 and 1800, available from DuPont Inc., Wilmington, Del.) typically have a melting point in the range of about 19° C. to about 36° C. Polyethylene oxides having a melting point in the range of about 60° C. to about 65° C. also can be used as phase change materials in some embodiments of the invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0078">For certain applications, polymeric phase change materials can include homopolymers having a melting point in the range of about 0° C. to about 50° C. that can be formed using conventional polymerization processes. Table 2 sets forth melting points of various homopolymers that can be formed from different types of monomer units.</p>

    <p num="p-0082">In some instances, a polymeric phase change material having a desired transition temperature can be formed by reacting a phase change material (e.g., a phase change material discussed above) with a polymer (or a mixture of polymers). Thus, for example, n-octadecylic acid (i.e., stearic acid) can be reacted or esterified with polyvinyl alcohol to yield polyvinyl stearate, or dodecanoic acid (i.e., lauric acid) can be reacted or esterified with polyvinyl alcohol to yield polyvinyl laurate. Various combinations of phase change materials (e.g., phase change materials with one or more functional groups such as amine, carboxyl, hydroxyl, epoxy, silane, sulfuric, and so forth) and polymers can be reacted to yield polymeric phase change materials having desired transition temperatures.</p>
    <p num="p-0083">Polymeric phase change materials having desired transition temperatures can be formed from various types of monomer units. For example, similar to polyoctadecyl methacrylate, a polymeric phase change material can be formed by polymerizing octadecyl methacrylate, which can be formed by esterification of octadecyl alcohol with methacrylic acid. Also, polymeric phase change materials can be formed by polymerizing a polymer (or a mixture of polymers). For example, poly-(polyethylene glycol) methacrylate, poly-(polyethylene glycol) acrylate, poly-(polytetramethylene glycol) methacrylate, and poly-(polytetramethylene glycol) acrylate can be formed by polymerizing polyethylene glycol methacrylate, polyethylene glycol acrylate, polytetramethylene glycol methacrylate, and polytetramethylene glycol acrylate, respectively. In this example, the monomer units can be formed by esterification of polyethylene glycol (or polytetramethylene glycol) with methacrylic acid (or acrylic acid). It is contemplated that polyglycols can be esterified with allyl alcohol or trans-esterified with vinyl acetate to form polyglycol vinyl ethers, which in turn can be polymerized to form poly-(polyglycol) vinyl ethers. In a similar manner, it is contemplated that polymeric phase change materials can be formed from homologues of polyglycols, such as, for example, ester or ether endcapped polyethylene glycols and polytetramethylene glycols.</p>
    <p num="p-0084">According to some embodiments of the invention, a temperature regulating material can include a phase change material in a raw form. During formation of a cellulosic fiber, a phase change material in a raw form can be provided as a solid in any of various forms (e.g., bulk form, powders, pellets, granules, flakes, and so forth) or as a liquid in any of various forms (e.g., molten form, dissolved in a solvent, and so forth).</p>
    <p num="p-0085">According to other embodiments of the invention, a temperature regulating material can include a containment structure that encapsulates, contains, surrounds, absorbs, or reacts with a phase change material. This containment structure can facilitate handling of the phase change material while also offering a degree of protection to the phase change material during formation of a cellulosic fiber or a product made therefrom (e.g., protection from solvents, high temperatures, or shear forces). Moreover, this containment structure can serve to reduce or prevent leakage of the phase change material from the cellulosic fiber during end use. According to some embodiments of the invention, use of a containment structure can be desirable, but not required, when an elongated member having a phase change material dispersed therein is not completely surrounded by another elongated member.</p>
    <p num="p-0086">For example, a temperature regulating material can include various microcapsules that contain a phase change material, and the microcapsules can be uniformly, or non-uniformly, dispersed within one or more elongated members forming a cellulosic fiber. The microcapsules can be formed as shells enclosing the phase change material and can include individual microcapsules formed in various regular or irregular shapes (e.g., spherical, ellipsoidal, and so forth) and sizes. The microcapsules can have shapes and sizes that are the same or different. According to some embodiments of the invention, microcapsules can have a maximum linear dimension (e.g., diameter) in the range of about 0.01 to about 100 microns. In some instances, the microcapsules can have a generally spherical shape and can have a maximum linear dimension in the range of about 0.5 to about 10 microns, such as, for example, from about 0.5 to about 3 microns. Other examples of a containment structure include silica particles (e.g., precipitated silica particles, fumed silica particles, and mixtures thereof), zeolite particles, carbon particles (e.g., graphite particles, activated carbon particles, and mixtures thereof), and absorbent materials (e.g., absorbent polymeric materials such as certain cellulosic materials, superabsorbent materials, poly(meth)acrylate materials, metal salts of poly(meth)acrylate materials, and mixtures thereof). For example, a temperature regulating material can include silica particles, zeolite particles, carbon particles, or an absorbent material impregnated with a phase change material.</p>
    <p num="p-0087">According to some embodiments of the invention, an elongated member forming a cellulosic fiber can include up to about 100 percent by weight of a temperature regulating material. Typically, an elongated member includes up to about 90 percent by weight of a temperature regulating material. Thus, for example, the elongated member can include up to about 50 percent or up to about 25 percent by weight of the temperature regulating material. For some embodiments of the invention, an elongated member can include from about 5 percent to about 70 percent by weight of a temperature regulating material. Thus, in one embodiment, an elongated member can include from about 5 percent to about 60 percent by weight of a temperature regulating material, and, in other embodiments, an elongated member can include from about 10 percent to about 30 percent or from about 15 percent to about 25 percent by weight of a temperature regulating material.</p>
    <p num="p-0088">As discussed previously, a cellulosic fiber according to some embodiments of the invention can include a set of elongated members. Various elongated members of the set of elongated members can be formed from the same cellulosic material or different cellulosic materials. In some instances, the set of elongated members can include a first set of elongated members formed from a first cellulosic material that has a temperature regulating material dispersed therein. In addition, the set of elongated members can include a second set of elongated members formed from a second cellulosic material. It is contemplated that the elongated members can be formed from the same cellulosic material, in which case the first and second cellulosic materials will be the same. It is also contemplated that the temperature regulating material can include a polymeric phase change material that provides adequate mechanical properties. In this case, the polymeric phase change material can be used to form the first set of elongated members without requiring the first cellulosic material.</p>
    <p num="p-0089">In general, a cellulosic material can include any cellulose-based polymer (or any mixture of cellulose-based polymers) that has the capability of being formed into an elongated member. A cellulosic material can include a cellulose-based polymer (or a mixture of cellulose-based polymers) having any of various chain structures and including one or more types of monomer units. In particular, a cellulose-based polymer can be a linear polymer or a branched polymer (e.g., star branched polymer, comb branched polymer, or dendritic branched polymer). A cellulose-based polymer can be a homopolymer or a copolymer (e.g., terpolymer, statistical copolymer, random copolymer, alternating copolymer, periodic copolymer, block copolymer, radial copolymer, or graft copolymer). As one of ordinary skill in the art will understand, the reactivity and functionality of a cellulose-based polymer can be altered by addition or replacement of a functional group such as, for example, amine, amide, carboxyl, hydroxyl, ester, ether, epoxide, anhydride, isocyanate, silane, ketone, and aldehyde. Also, a cellulose-based polymer can be capable of crosslinking, entanglement, or hydrogen bonding in order to increase its toughness or its resistance to heat, moisture, or chemicals.</p>
    <p num="p-0090">Examples of cellulose-based polymers that can be used to form an elongated member include cellulose and various modified forms of cellulose, such as, for example, cellulose esters (e.g., cellulose acetate, cellulose propionate, cellulose butyrate, cellulose phthalate, and cellulose trimellitate), cellulose nitrate, cellulose phosphate, cellulose ethers (e.g., methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, propyl cellulose, and butyl cellulose), other modified forms of cellulose (e.g., carboxy methyl cellulose, hydroxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and cyanoethyl cellulose), and salts or copolymers thereof. Cellulose typically corresponds to a linear homopolymer of D-glucose in which successive monomer units are linked by β-glucoside bonds from an anomeric carbon of one monomer unit to a C-4 hydroxyl group of another monomer unit. Other useful cellulose-based polymers include modified forms of cellulose in which, for example, a certain percentage of hydroxyl groups are replaced by various other types of functional groups. Cellulose acetate typically corresponds to a modified form of cellulose in which a certain percentage of hydroxyl groups are replaced by acetyl groups. The percentage of hydroxyl groups that are replaced can depend upon various processing conditions. In some instances, cellulose acetate can have at least about 92 percent of its hydroxyl groups replaced by acetyl groups, and, in other instances, cellulose acetate can have an average of at least about 2 acetyl groups per monomer unit. For certain applications, a cellulosic material can include cellulose-based polymers having an average molecular chain length in the range of about 300 to about 15,000 monomer units. Thus, in one embodiment, a cellulosic material can include cellulose-based polymers having an average molecular chain length in the range of about 10,000 to about 15,000 monomer units. In other embodiments, a cellulosic material can include cellulose-based polymers having an average molecular chain length in the range of about 300 to about 10,000, such as, for example, from about 300 to about 450 monomer units, from about 450 to about 750 monomer units, or from about 750 to about 10,000 monomer units.</p>
    <p num="p-0091">It is contemplated that one or more elongated members can be formed from various other types of polymeric materials. Thus, in some embodiments of the invention, an elongated member can be formed from any fiber-forming polymer (or any mixture of fiber-forming polymers). Examples polymers that can be used to form an elongated member include polyamides (e.g., Nylon 6, Nylon 6/6, Nylon 12, polyaspartic acid, polyglutamic acid, and so forth), polyamines, polyimides, polyacrylics (e.g., polyacrylamide, polyacrylonitrile, esters of methacrylic acid and acrylic acid, and so forth), polycarbonates (e.g., polybisphenol A carbonate, polypropylene carbonate, and so forth), polydienes (e.g., polybutadiene, polyisoprene, polynorbomene, and so forth), polyepoxides, polyesters (e.g., polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polytrimethylene terephthalate, polycaprolactone, polyglycolide, polylactide, polyhydroxybutyrate, polyhydroxyvalerate, polyethylene adipate, polybutylene adipate, polypropylene succinate, and so forth), polyethers (e.g., polyethylene glycol (polyethylene oxide), polybutylene glycol, polypropylene oxide, polyoxymethylene (paraformaldehyde), polytetramethylene ether (polytetrahydrofuran), polyepichlorohydrin, and so forth), polyfluorocarbons, formaldehyde polymers (e.g., urea-formaldehyde, melamine-formaldehyde, phenol formaldehyde, and so forth), natural polymers (e.g., chitosans, lignins, waxes, and so forth), polyolefins (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutylene, polybutene, polyoctene, and so forth), polyphenylenes (e.g., polyphenylene oxide, polyphenylene sulfide, polyphenylene ether sulfone, and so forth), silicon containing polymers (e.g., polydimethyl siloxane, polycarbomethyl silane, and so forth), polyurethanes, polyureas, polyvinyls (e.g., polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl alcohol, esters and ethers of polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetate, polystyrene, polymethylstyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl pryrrolidone, polymethyl vinyl ether, polyethyl vinyl ether, polyvinyl methyl ketone, and so forth), polyacetals, polyarylates, and copolymers (e.g., polyethylene-co-vinyl acetate, polyethylene-co-acrylic acid, polybutylene terephthalate-co-polyethylene terephthalate, polylauryllactam-block-polytetrahydrofuran, and so forth).</p>
    <p num="p-0092">According to some embodiments of the invention, one or more elongated members can be formed from a carrier polymeric material. A carrier polymeric material can serve as a carrier for a temperature regulating material as a cellulosic fiber is formed in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. A carrier polymeric material can include a polymer (or a mixture of polymers) that facilitates dispersing or incorporating a temperature regulating material within one or more elongated members. In addition, a carrier polymeric material can facilitate maintaining integrity of one or more elongated members during fiber formation and can provide enhanced mechanical properties to the resulting cellulosic fiber. Desirably, a carrier polymeric material can be selected to be sufficiently non-reactive with a temperature regulating material, such that a desired temperature stabilizing range is maintained when the temperature regulating material is dispersed within the carrier polymeric material.</p>
    <p num="p-0093">A carrier polymeric material can be used in conjunction with, or as an alternative to, a cellulosic material when forming one or more elongated members. In some instances, a carrier polymeric material can serve as a containment structure to facilitate handling of a phase change material while also offering a degree of protection to the phase change material during formation of a cellulosic fiber or a product made therefrom. During formation of a cellulosic fiber, a carrier polymeric material can be provided as a solid in any of various forms (e.g., bulk form, powders, pellets, granules, flakes, and so forth) and can have a temperature regulating material dispersed therein. Thus, for example, powders or pellets formed from the carrier polymeric material having the temperature regulating material dispersed therein can be mixed with a cellulosic material to form a blend, which is used to form one or more elongated members. It is contemplated that a carrier polymeric material can be provided as a liquid in any of various forms (e.g., molten form, dissolved in a solvent, and so forth) and can have a temperature regulating material dispersed therein. It is also contemplated that a cellulosic material can serve as a carrier polymeric material. For example, a cellulosic material having a temperature regulating material dispersed therein can be mixed with the same or a different cellulosic material to form a blend, which is used to form one or more elongated members.</p>
    <p num="p-0094">For certain applications, a carrier polymeric material can include a polymer (or a mixture of polymers) that is compatible or miscible with or has an affinity for a temperature regulating material. Such affinity can depend on a number of factors, such as, for example, similarity of solubility parameters, polarities, hydrophobic characteristics, or hydrophilic characteristics of the carrier polymeric material and the temperature regulating material. An affinity for a temperature regulating material can facilitate dispersion of the temperature regulating material in an intermediate molten, liquid, or dissolved form of a carrier polymeric material during formation of a cellulosic fiber. Ultimately, such affinity can facilitate incorporation of more uniform or greater amounts (e.g., higher loading levels) of a phase change material in the cellulosic fiber.</p>
    <p num="p-0095">For embodiments of the invention where a temperature regulating material includes a containment structure such as microcapsules, a carrier polymeric material can include a polymer (or a mixture of polymers) having an affinity for the containment structure in conjunction with, or as an alternative to, its affinity for a phase change material. For example, if the temperature regulating material includes various microcapsules containing the phase change material, a polymer (or a mixture of polymers) can be selected based on its affinity for the microcapsules (e.g., for a material of which the microcapsules are formed). In some instances, the carrier polymeric material can include the same or a similar polymer as one forming the microcapsules. Thus, for example, if the microcapsules include nylon shells, the carrier polymeric material can be selected to include nylon. Such affinity for the microcapsules can facilitate dispersion of the microcapsules containing the phase change material in an intermediate molten, liquid, or dissolved form of the carrier polymeric material and, thus, facilitates incorporation of more uniform or greater amounts of the phase change material in a cellulosic fiber.</p>
    <p num="p-0096">In some instances, a carrier polymeric material can include a polymer (or a mixture of polymers) that has a partial affinity for a temperature regulating material. For example, the carrier polymeric material can include a polymer (or a mixture of polymers) that is semi-miscible with the temperature regulating material. Such partial affinity can be adequate to facilitate dispersion of the temperature regulating material within the carrier polymeric material at higher temperatures and shear conditions. At lower temperatures and shear conditions, such partial affinity can allow the temperature regulating material to separate out. If a phase change material in a raw form is used, such partial affinity can lead to insolubilization of the phase change material and increased phase change material domain formation within the carrier polymeric material and within the resulting cellulosic fiber. Domain formation can lead to improved thermal regulating properties by facilitating transition of the phase change material between two states. In addition, domain formation can serve to reduce or prevent loss or leakage of the phase change material from the cellulosic fiber during fiber formation or during end use.</p>
    <p num="p-0097">For example, certain phase change materials such as paraffinic hydrocarbons can be compatible with polyolefins or copolymers of polyolefins at lower concentrations of the phase change materials or when the temperature is above a critical solution temperature. Thus, for example, mixing of a paraffinic hydrocarbon (or a mixture of paraffinic hydrocarbons) and polyethylene or polyethylene-co-vinyl acetate can be achieved at higher temperatures to produce a substantially homogenous blend that can be easily controlled, pumped, and processed in connection with fiber formation. Once the blend has cooled, the paraffinic hydrocarbon can become insoluble and can separate out into distinct domains within a solid material. These domains can allow for pure melting or crystallization of the paraffinic hydrocarbon for an improved thermal regulating property. In addition, these domains can serve to reduce or prevent loss or leakage of the paraffinic hydrocarbon. The solid material having the domains dispersed therein can be processed to form powders or pellets, which can be mixed with a cellulosic material to form a cellulosic fiber.</p>
    <p num="p-0098">According to some embodiments of the invention, a carrier polymeric material can include polyethylene-co-vinyl acetate having from about 5 percent to about 90 percent by weight of vinyl acetate, such as, for example, from about 5 percent to about 50 percent by weight of vinyl acetate or from about 18 percent to about 25 percent by weight of vinyl acetate. This content of vinyl acetate can allow for improved temperature miscibility control when mixing a paraffinic hydrocarbon and the polyethylene-co-vinyl acetate to form a blend. In particular, this vinyl acetate content can allow for excellent miscibility at higher temperatures, thus facilitating processing stability and control due to homogeneity of the blend. At lower temperatures (e.g., room temperature or normal commercial fabric use temperatures), the polyethylene-co-vinyl acetate is semi-miscible with the paraffinic hydrocarbon, thus allowing for separation and micro-domain formation of the paraffinic hydrocarbon.</p>
    <p num="p-0099">Other polymers that can be included in a carrier polymeric material include high-density polyethylenes having a melt index in the range of about 4 to about 36 g/10 min (e.g., high-density polyethylenes having melt indices of 4, 12, and 36 g/10 min, available from Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, Mo.), modified forms of high-density polyethylenes (e.g., Fusabondg® MB100D, available from DuPont Inc., Wilmington, Del.), and modified forms of ethylene propylene rubber (e.g., Fusabond® N MF416D, available from DuPont Inc., Wilmington, Del.). As one of ordinary skill in the art will understand, a melt index typically refers to a measure of the flow characteristics of a polymer (or a mixture of polymers) and inversely correlates with a molecular weight of the polymer (or the mixture of polymers). For polar phase change materials (e.g., polyethylene glycols, polytetramethylene glycols, and their homologues), a carrier polymeric material can include a polar polymer (or a mixture of polar polymers) to facilitate dispersion of the phase change materials. Thus, for example, the carrier polymeric material can include copolymers of polyesters, such as, for example, polybutylene terephthalate-block-polytetramethylene glycols (e.g., Hytrel® 3078, 5544, and 8238, available from DuPont Inc., Wilmington, Del.), and copolymers of polyamides, such as, for example, polyamide-block-polyethers (e.g., Pebax® 2533, 4033, 5533, 7033, MX 1205, and MH 1657, available from ATOFINA Chemicals, Inc., Philadelphia, Pa.).</p>
    <p num="p-0100">As discussed previously, a cellulosic material can serve as a carrier polymeric material in some embodiments of the invention. For example, certain phase change materials such as polyethylene glycols can be compatible with cellulose-based polymers in a solution. In particular, mixing of a polyethylene glycol (or a mixture of polyethylene glycols) and cellulose or cellulose acetate can be achieved to produce a substantially homogenous blend as described in the article of Guo et al., “Solution Miscibility and Phase-Change Behavior of a Polyethylene Gycol-Diacetate Cellulose Composite,” Journal of Applied Polymer Science, Vol. 88, 652-658 (2003), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The polyethylene glycol can form distinct domains within a resulting solid material and can undergo a transition between two solid states within these domains. The solid material having the domains dispersed therein can be processed to form powders or pellets, which can be mixed with a cellulosic material to form a cellulosic fiber.</p>
    <p num="p-0101">According to some embodiments of the invention, a carrier polymeric material can include a low molecular weight polymer (or a mixture of low molecular weight polymers). As discussed previously, some polymers can be provided in various forms having different molecular weights. Accordingly, a low molecular weight polymer can refer to a low molecular weight form of the polymer. For example, a polyethylene having a number average molecular weight of about 20,000 (or less) can be used as a low molecular weight polymer in an embodiment of the invention. A low molecular weight polymer typically has a low viscosity when heated to form a melt, which low viscosity can facilitate dispersion of a temperature regulating material in the melt. It is contemplated that a desired molecular weight or range of molecular weights of a low molecular weight polymer can depend upon the particular polymer selected (e.g., polyethylene) or upon the method or equipment used to disperse a temperature regulating material in a melt of the low molecular weight polymer.</p>
    <p num="p-0102">According to another embodiment of the invention, a carrier polymeric material can include a mixture of a low molecular weight polymer and a high molecular weight polymer. A high molecular weight polymer can refer to a high molecular weight form of the polymer. A high molecular weight polymer typically has enhanced mechanical properties but can have a high viscosity when heated to form a melt. In some instances, a low molecular weight polymer and a high molecular weight polymer can be selected to have an affinity for one another. Such affinity can facilitate forming a blend of the low molecular weight polymer, the high molecular weight polymer, and a temperature regulating material during fiber formation and can facilitate incorporation of more uniform or greater amounts of a phase change material in a cellulosic fiber. According to some embodiments of the invention, a low molecular weight polymer can serve as a compatibilizing link between a high molecular weight polymer and a temperature regulating material to facilitate incorporating the temperature regulating material in a cellulosic fiber.</p>
    <p num="p-0103">Cellulosic fibers in accordance with various embodiments of the invention can be formed using various methods, including, for example, a solution spinning process (wet or dry). In a solution spinning process, one or more cellulosic materials and one or more temperature regulating materials can be delivered to orifices of a spinneret. As one of ordinary skill in the art will understand, a spinneret typically refers to a portion of a fiber forming apparatus that delivers molten, liquid, or dissolved materials through orifices for extrusion into an outside environment. A spinneret typically includes from about 1 to about 500,000 orifices per meter of length of the spinneret. A spinneret can be implemented with holes drilled or etched through a plate or with any other structure capable of issuing desired fibers.</p>
    <p num="p-0104">A cellulosic material can be initially provided in any of various forms, such as, for example, sheets of cellulose, wood pulp, cotton linters, and other sources of substantially purified cellulose. Typically, a cellulosic material is dissolved in a solvent prior to passing through the orifices of the spinneret. In some instances, the cellulosic material can be processed (e.g., chemically treated) prior to dissolving the cellulosic material in the solvent. For example, the cellulosic material can be immersed in a basic solution (e.g., caustic soda), squeezed through rollers, and then shredded to form crumbs. The crumbs can then be treated with carbon disulfide to form cellulose xanthate. As another example, the cellulosic material can be mixed with a solution of glacial acetic acid, acetic anhydride, and a catalyst and then aged to form cellulose acetate, which can precipitate from the solution in the form of flakes.</p>
    <p num="p-0105">The composition of a solvent used to dissolve a cellulosic material can vary depending upon a desired application of the resulting cellulosic fibers. For example, crumbs of cellulose xanthate as discussed above can be dissolved in a basic solvent (e.g., caustic soda or 2.8 percent sodium hydroxide solution) to form a viscous solution. As another example, precipitated flakes of cellulose acetate as discussed above can be dissolved in acetone to form a viscous solution. Various other types of solvents can be used, such as, for example, a solution of amine oxide or a cuprammonium solution. In some instances, the resulting viscous solution can be filtered to remove any undissolved cellulosic material.</p>
    <p num="p-0106">During formation of cellulosic fibers, a temperature regulating material can be mixed with a cellulosic material to form a blend. As a result of mixing, the temperature regulating material can be dispersed within and at least partially enclosed by the cellulosic material. The temperature regulating material can be mixed with the cellulosic material at various stages of fiber formation. Typically, the temperature regulating material is mixed with the cellulosic material prior to passing through the orifices of the spinneret. In particular, the temperature regulating material can be mixed with the cellulosic material prior to or after dissolving the cellulosic material in a solvent. For example, the temperature regulating material can include microcapsules containing a phase change material, and the microcapsules can be dispersed in a viscous solution of the dissolved cellulosic material. In some instances, the temperature regulating material can be mixed with the viscous solution just prior to passing through the orifices of the spinneret.</p>
    <p num="p-0107">According to some embodiments of the invention, cellulosic fibers can be formed using a carrier polymeric material. For example, the cellulosic fibers can be formed using powders or pellets formed from the carrier polymeric material having a temperature regulating material dispersed therein. In some instances, the powders or pellets can be formed from a solidified melt mixture of the carrier polymeric material and the temperature regulating material. It is contemplated that the powders or pellets can be initially formed from the carrier polymeric material and can be impregnated or imbibed with the temperature regulating material. It is also contemplated that the powders or pellets can be formed from a dried solution of the carrier polymeric material and the temperature regulating material. During formation of the cellulosic fibers, the powders or pellets can be mixed with a cellulosic material to form a blend at various stages of fiber formation. Typically, the powders or pellets are mixed with the cellulosic material prior to passing through the orifices of the spinneret.</p>
    <p num="p-0108">For certain applications, cellulosic fibers can be formed as multi-component fibers. In particular, a first cellulosic material can be mixed with a temperature regulating material to form a blend. The blend and a second cellulosic material can be combined and directed through the orifices of the spinneret in a particular configuration to form respective elongated members of the cellulosic fibers. For example, the blend can be directed through the orifices to form core members or island members, while the second cellulosic material can be directed through the orifices to form sheath members or sea members. Prior to passing through the orifices, the first cellulosic material and the second cellulosic material can be dissolved in the same solvent or different solvents. Portions of the temperature regulating material that are not enclosed by the first cellulosic material can be enclosed by the second cellulosic material upon emerging from the spinneret to reduce or prevent loss or leakage of the temperature regulating material from the resulting cellulosic fibers. It is contemplated that the first cellulosic material need not be used for certain applications. For example, the temperature regulating material can include a polymeric phase change material having a desired transition temperature and providing adequate mechanical properties when incorporated in the cellulosic fibers. The polymeric phase change material and the second cellulosic material can be combined and directed through the orifices of the spinneret in a particular configuration to form respective elongated members of the cellulosic fibers. For example, the polymeric phase change material can be directed through the orifices to form core members or island members, while the second cellulosic material can be directed through the orifices to form sheath members or sea members.</p>
    <p num="p-0109">Upon emerging from the spinneret, one or more cellulosic materials typically solidify to form cellulosic fibers. In a wet solution spinning process, the spinneret can be submerged in a coagulation or spinning bath (e.g., a chemical bath), such that, upon exiting the spinneret, one or more cellulosic materials can precipitate and form solid cellulosic fibers. The composition of a spinning bath can vary depending upon a desired application of the resulting cellulosic fibers. For example, the spinning bath can be water, an acidic solution (e.g., a weak acid solution including sulfuric acid), or a solution of amine oxide. In a dry solution spinning process, one or more cellulosic materials can emerge from the spinneret in warm air and solidify due to a solvent (e.g., acetone) evaporating in the warm air.</p>
    <p num="p-0110">After emerging from the spinneret, cellulosic fibers can be drawn or stretched utilizing a godet or an aspirator. For example, cellulosic fibers emerging from the spinneret can form a vertically oriented curtain of downwardly moving cellulosic fibers that are drawn between variable speed godet rolls before being wound on a bobbin or cut into staple fiber. Cellulosic fibers emerging from the spinneret can also form a horizontally oriented curtain within a spinning bath and can be drawn between variable speed godet rolls. As another example, cellulosic fibers emerging from the spinneret can be at least partially quenched before entering a long, slot-shaped air aspirator positioned below the spinneret. The aspirator can introduce a rapid, downwardly moving air stream produced by compressed air from one or more air aspirating jets. The air stream can create a drawing force on the cellulosic fibers, causing them to be drawn between the spinneret and the air jet and attenuating the cellulosic fibers. During this portion of fiber formation, one or more cellulosic materials forming the cellulosic fibers can be solidifying. It is contemplated that drawing or stretching of cellulosic fibers can occur before or after drying the cellulosic fibers.</p>
    <p num="p-0111">Once formed, cellulosic fibers can be further processed for various fiber applications. In particular, cellulosic fibers in accordance with various embodiments of the invention can be used or incorporated in various products to provide thermal regulating properties to these products. For example, cellulosic fibers can be used in textiles (e.g., fabrics), apparel (e.g., outdoor clothing, drysuits, and protective suits), footwear (e.g., socks, boots, and insoles), medical products (e.g., thermal blankets, therapeutic pads, incontinent pads, and hot/cold packs), containers and packagings (e.g., beverage/food containers, food warmers, seat cushions, and circuit board laminates), buildings (e.g., insulation in walls or ceilings, wallpaper, curtain linings, pipe wraps, carpets, and tiles), appliances (e.g., insulation in house appliances), and other products (e.g., automotive lining material, furnishings, sleeping bags, and bedding).</p>
    <p num="p-0112">In some instances, cellulosic fibers can be subjected to, for example, woven, non-woven, knitting, or weaving processes to form various types of plaited, braided, twisted, felted, knitted, woven, or non-woven fabrics. For example, cellulosic fibers can be wound on a bobbin or spun into a yarn and then utilized in various conventional knitting or weaving processes. As another example, cellulosic fibers can be randomly laid on a forming surface (e.g., a moving conveyor screen belt such as a Fourdrinier wire) to form a continuous, non-woven web of cellulosic fibers. In some instances, cellulosic fibers can be cut into short staple fibers prior to forming the web. One potential advantage of employing staple fibers is that a more isotropic non-woven web can be formed, since the staple fibers can be oriented in the web more randomly than longer or uncut fibers (e.g., continuous fibers). The web can then be bonded using any conventional bonding process (e.g., a spunbond process) to form a stable, non-woven fabric for use in manufacturing various textiles. An example of a bonding process involves lifting the web from a moving conveyor screen belt and passing the web through two heated calender rolls. One, or both, of the rolls can be embossed to cause the web to be bonded in numerous spots. Air carded or spun-laid webs can be formed from cellulosic fibers in accordance with some embodiments of the invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0113">It is contemplated that fabrics can be formed from cellulosic fibers including two or more different temperature regulating materials. According to some embodiments of the invention, such combination of temperature regulating materials can exhibit two or more distinct transition temperatures. For example, a fabric for use in a glove can be formed from cellulosic fibers that each includes phase change materials A and B. Phase change material A can have a melting point of about 5° C., and phase change material B can have a melting point of about 75° C. This combination of phase change materials in the cellulosic fibers can provide the glove with improved thermal regulating properties in cold environments (e.g., outdoor use during winter conditions) as well as warm environments (e.g., when handling heated objects such as oven trays). In addition, fabrics can be formed from two or more types of cellulosic fibers that differ in some fashion (e.g., formed with different configurations or including different temperature regulating materials). For example, a fabric can be formed with a certain percentage of cellulosic fibers including phase change material A and a remaining percentage of cellulosic fibers including phase change material B. This combination of cellulosic fibers can provide the fabric with improved thermal regulating properties in different environments (e.g., cold and warm environments).</p>
    <p num="p-0114">At this point, one of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate a number of advantages associated with various embodiments of the invention. For example, cellulosic fibers in accordance with various embodiments of the invention can provide improved thermal regulating properties along with high moisture absorbency. Such combination of properties allows for an improved level of comfort when the cellulosic fibers are incorporated in products such as, for example, apparel or footwear. A cellulosic fiber in accordance with some embodiments of the invention can include a high loading level of a phase change material within a first set of elongated members. In some instances, such high loading level can be provided because a second set of elongated members can surround the first set of elongated members. The second set of elongated members can compensate for any deficiencies (e.g., mechanical or moisture absorbency deficiencies) of the first set of elongated members. Moreover, the second set of elongated members can include a cellulosic material selected to improve the cellulosic fiber's overall mechanical properties, moisture absorbency, and processability (e.g., by facilitating its formation via a solution spinning process). By surrounding the first set of elongated members, the second set of elongated members can serve to enclose the phase change material within the cellulosic fiber to reduce or prevent loss or leakage of the phase change material.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE </heading> <p num="p-0115">The following example is provided as a guide for a practitioner of ordinary skill in the art. The example should not be construed as limiting the invention, as the example merely provides specific methodology useful in understanding and practicing an embodiment of the invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0116">Three sets of cellulosic fibers were formed. A first set of cellulosic fibers was used as a control set. For the first set of cellulosic fibers, 8.00 g of N-methyl morpholine oxide solvent (97 percent NMMO, available from Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis.), 1.00 g of microcrystalline cellulose (available from Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis.), and 1.00 g of deionized water were combined in a 20 ml glass vial to yield a solution with 10 percent by weight of cellulose. The vial was placed in a 125° C. oven and periodically mixed until its contents were homogenously mixed. The contents were then poured into a preheated 10 ml syringe and slowly squeezed into a coagulation bath of warm, stirred water to form the first set of cellulosic fibers.</p>
    <p num="p-0117">For a second set of cellulosic fibers, 0.90 g of deionized water and 0.20 g of water-wetted microcapsules containing a phase change material (microencapsulated paraffin PCM, 120 J/g latent heat, 33° C. melting point, 50 percent microcapsules, available from Ciba Specialty Chemical Co., Bradford, United Kingdom) were combined in a 20 ml glass vial. Next, 8.00 g of N-methyl morpholine oxide solvent (97 percent NMMO, available from Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis.) and 0.90 g of microcrystalline cellulose (available from Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis.) were added to yield a solution with 10 percent by weight of solids. The solids included a 90/10 weight ratio of cellulose/microcapsules containing the phase change material. The vial was placed in a 125° C. oven and periodically mixed until its contents were homogenously mixed. The contents were then poured into a preheated 10 ml syringe and slowly squeezed into a coagulation bath of warm, stirred water to form lyocell-type cellulosic fibers with enhanced reversible thermal properties.</p>
    <p num="p-0118">For a third set of cellulosic fibers, 0.80 g of deionized water and 0.31 g of water-wetted microcapsules containing a phase change material (microencapsulated paraffin PCM, 154 J/g latent heat, 31° C. melting point, 32 percent microcapsules, available from J&amp;C Microchem Inc., Korea) were combined in a 20 ml glass vial. Next, 8.00 g of N-methyl morpholine oxide solvent (97 percent NMMO, available from Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis.) and 0.90 g of microcrystalline cellulose (available from Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis.) were added to yield a solution with 10 percent by weight of solids. The solids included a 90/10 weight ratio of cellulose/microcapsules containing the phase change material. The vial was placed in a 125° C. oven and periodically mixed until its contents were homogenously mixed. The contents were then poured into a preheated 10 ml syringe and slowly squeezed into a coagulation bath of warm, stirred water to form lyocell-type cellulosic fibers with enhanced reversible thermal properties.</p>
    <p num="p-0119">The three sets of cellulosic fibers were filtered and dried, and thermal measurements were made using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Table 4 sets forth results of these thermal measurements for the three sets of cellulosic fibers.</p>
