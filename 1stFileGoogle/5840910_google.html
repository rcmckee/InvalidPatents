    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading> <p>Novel pyridine derivatives exhibiting activity in treating or preventing peptic ulcers, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and methods of medical treatment are described.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading> <p>Duodenal and gastric ulcers, known collectively as peptic ulcers, are localized erosions of the mucous membrane of the duodenum or stomach, respectively, which expose the underlying layers of the gut wall to the acid secretions of the stomach and to the proteolytic enzyme pepsin. They are believed to be caused by autolysis which is caused by an imbalance between offensive factors, such as acid or pepsin and defensive factors, such as resistance of the mucous membrane, mucilage secretion, bloodstream or control of the duodenum. Peptic ulceration in the moat common disease of the gastro-intestinal tract and it is estimated that approximately 10 to 20% of the adult male population will experience at some time in their lives.</p>
    <p>Peptic ulcers are cured or prevented by medical treatment, in principle, and many pharmacotherapies have been suggested, some with high degrees of success.</p>
    <p>Clinically useful modialities include H-<sub>2</sub> -blockers, such as cimetidine and ranitidine, as anti-ulcer agents. It has been noted, more recently, that inhibitors of H<sup>+</sup> -K<sup>+</sup> -ATPase, an enzyme specifically present in the parietal cells of the stomach, can effectively inhibit the secretion of gastric acid in mammals, including man, therefore it has been expected that a new class of anti-ulcer agents from this viewpoint will come into existance. More specifically, a wide variety of compounds having a benzimidazole structure have been proposed. Among these compounds is Omeprazole, currently under active development, a the most promising compound; see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,337,257; 4,255,431; and 4,508,905. These patents describe compounds with a methoxy group in the 4-position of the pyridine ring. Omeprazole, having the formula: ##STR1## and further 2-(4-methoxyethoxypyridine-2-yl)-methylsulfinyl-5-methyl-1H-benzimidazole in the working examples thereof.</p>
    <p>Related benzyimidazole-type compounds having anti-ulcer activities are described in published application GB 2.134.523A. More specifically, compounds in which the 4-position of the pyridine ring is substituted with an alkoxyalkoxy group with each alkoxy group containing 1-2 carbons are described. Example 157 of this patent describes 2-(3,5-dimethyl-4-methoxyethoxypyridine-2-yl)methylsulfinyl-5-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole. Other substitutions on various positions of the benzyl and pyridine rings are also described.</p>
    <p>Biological tests reported in tables 4 and 5 of this published application report significant biological effects on gastric acid secretion, both in isolated cells and in laboratory animals, when the 4-position on the pyridine ring is substituted with a methoxy group.</p>
    <p>Additional benzimidazole-type compounds, in which the substituent at the 4-position on the pyridine ring is a benzyloxy group, are described in European patent application 0,167,943.</p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present inventors have discovered a class of novel compounds with a more excellent anti-ulcer activity than Omeprazole which is regarded, at the present time, as the most significant benzimidizole-type compound having anti-ulcer activity. As a result of intensive studies, it has been found that compounds represented by formula (I) are more potent in inhibiting gastric acid secretion in comparison with Omeprazole. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of this finding.</p>

    <heading>PHARMACOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT</heading> <heading>Inhibition Against the Activity of H<sup>+</sup> -K<sup>+</sup>  ATPase</heading> <p>(1) Preparation of H<sup>+</sup> -K<sup>+</sup>  ATPase</p>
    <p>Prepared from the fundic-glands of a fresh mucous membrane of a pig stomach according to a modified method of Saccomani al. (see Biochem. and Biophys. Acta, 464; 313 (1977)).</p>
    <p>(2) Measurement of the activity of H<sup>+</sup> -K<sup>+</sup>  ATPase</p>
    <p>The compound of the present invention was incubated at various concentration in a 40 mM Tris-HCl buffer solution having a pH of 7.40 together with H<sup>+</sup> -K<sup>+</sup>  ATPase and 10 μg/ml of a protein at 37° C. for 30 minutes, followed by the addition of 15 mM KCl. After 10 minutes, the ATPase reaction was initiated by the addition of 3 mM of MgCl<sub>2</sub> and ATP. After 10 minutes, the amount of the released inorganic phosphoric acid was determined according to the method of Yoda and Hokin (see Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com., 40, 880 (1970)).</p>
    <p>The test compound was used as a solution in methanol.</p>
    <p>The inhibitory effect was determined by subtracting the amount of the released inorganic acid observed with respect to the case wherein a solution of a test compound was added from that with respect to the control wherein only a solvent was added to determine a difference and dividing this difference by the latter amount and shown by percentage.

    <p>It is apparent from the results of the experiments that the compound of the present invention exhibits a high inhibitory effect on the activity of H<sup>+</sup> -K<sup>+</sup>  ATPase and is highly safe, so that it can effectively inhibit the secretion of an acid and is therefore effective in the therapy or prevention of human and animal peptic ulcer.</p>
    <p>Further, the compound of the present invention exhibits excellent recovery of the secretion of an acid and therefore is superior to the one of the prior art in this respect.</p>
    <p>Chronic gastric fistula dogs were used. The test compound was intraduodenally administered to each dog in an amount of 4 mg per kg. In 1, 24, 48 and 72 hours, respectively, from the time of administration, pentagastrin (6 micron grams per kg) was injected intramuscularly into the dog. Gastric acid secretion, determined and recovery thereof, was determined in terms of percent of the control response. Results from this test are shown in Table 3.</p>
    <p>From the results, it can be determined that within one hour from the intraduodenal administration the pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion was completely inhibited in both tests of compound 19 and Omeprazole. In the test, acid output with compound 19 was 61.9 percent and 121.5 percent in comparison with the control group after 24 and 48 hours, respectively. On the other hand, in the same test using Omeprazole, gastric acid secretion was 108.4 percent after 72 hours. With both compound 19 and Omeprazole, 48 hours and 72 hours were required for the acid secretion to recover, respectively.</p>
    <heading>PHARMACOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT 2</heading> <heading>Inhibitory Effect on Gastric Acid Secretion</heading> <p>Chronic gastric fistula dogs were used. Gastric acid secretion of each dog was stimulated by infusing 100 micron grams per kg per hour of histamine. After one hour of histamine infusion, each of the test compounds was administered intraduodenally to each dog, and after one hour of administration, the amount of gastric acid secretion of each test dog was determined. Results wore compared with the control group to which no test compound had been administered and are expressed in terms of percent inhibition.</p>
    <p>The inhibitory effect exhibited by the test compound on the histamine-stimulated gastric acid secretion of the chronic gastric fistula dogs is shown in Table 2. The values of ID 50, calculated from the dose-inhibition curve of the test compounds, are 59.9 micron grams per kg for compound 19 and 112.2 micron grams per kg for Omeprazole, demonstrating that compound 19 was two times more potent than Omeprazole. Compound 19 is shown in Table 1 of Experiment 1 and in working example 33 shown below.</p>

    <p>The results of the three pharmacological experiments an reported above demonstrate that the compound of the invention exhibits a significant inhibitory effect on the activity of H<sup>+</sup> -K<sup>+</sup> ATPase.</p>
    <p>Among these compounds, compound 19 of the invention unexpectedly has a more potent inhibitory activity on gastric acid secretion as compared with Omeprazole, which itself is highly inhibitory of gastric acid secretion along the compounds having a benzimidazole-type structure.</p>
    <p>Further, it should be noted that the compound of the present invention unexpectedly exhibits a faster recovery or resumption of gastric acid secretion than Omeprazole.</p>
    <p>At present, this H<sup>+</sup> -K<sup>+</sup> ATPase-inhibiting agent is believed to have a more potent inhibitory activity against gastric acid secretion than an H<sub>2</sub> -blocker compound, and thus, in the future, may be the drug of choice for the treatment of ulcers.</p>
    <p>But, while more potent inhibitory activity against gastric acid secretion in desirable, too long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion is not preferable for an anti-ulcer agent. For example, it gives rise to the proliferation of Enterochromaffin-like calls (ECL cell) and formation of carcinoid derived from hypergastrinemia; see "Digestion", vol. 35, suppl. 1, page 42 to 55 (1986); the increase in the gastric bacterial flora and endogenous production of N-nitro compounds; see "Brit. Med. J.", Vol. 289, page 717 (1984); and difficulty in determining the appropriate dosage regimen.</p>
    <p>Thus, an H<sup>+</sup> -K<sup>+</sup> ATPase-inhibitory agent which possesses an excellent recovery of gastric acid secretion is most preferred.</p>
    <p>No toxicological influence has been observed for compound 19 (working example 33), which in a representative compound of this invention, in beagle dogs to which it was orally administered at 10 mg/kg per day for one week, and in rate to which it was orally administered at 50 mg/kg per day for one week.</p>
    <p>Thus, compound 19, as representative of this invention, exhibits a significant inhibitory effect upon the activity of H<sup>+</sup> -K<sup>+</sup> ATPase coupled with the desirable property of excellent gastric acid secretion recovery.</p>
    <p>Compound 19, as representative of the compounds of this invention, is thus considered to be effective in the treatment or prevention of peptic ulcers (stomach ulcers and duodenal ulcers) in animals, including human.</p>
    <p>The compounds of the present invention are administered for the therapy or prevention of peptic ulcers either orally as powders, granules, capsules or syrup, or parenterally as an injection, or is an external preparation or drop, or as a suppository. Although the dose remarkably varies depending upon symptoms, age or kind of ulcer(s), it may be about 0.01 to 200 mg/kg, preferably 0.05 to 50 mg/kg, still preferably 0.1 to 10 mg/kg a day, and may be administered in a single dose or in divided doses, for example from 2 to 4 times a day.</p>
    <p>The drug may be formulated into pharmaceutical presentations using conventional formulation procedures. More specifically, a solid drug for oral application can be prepared by mixing in active principle with filler and, if necessary, binder, disintegrating agent, lubricant, coloring agent, corrigent or the like and converting the obtained mixture into a tablet, coated tablet, granule, powder or capsule.</p>
    <p>Examples of the filler include lactose, corn starch, sucrose, glucose, sorbitol, crystalline cellulose and silicon dioxide, while those of the binder include polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl ether, ethylcellulose, methylcellulose, acacia, tragacanth, gelatin, shellac, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylstarch and polyvinylpyrrolidone. Examples of the disintegrating agent include starch, agar, gelatin powder, crystalline cellulose, calcium carbonate, sodium hydrogencarbonate, calcium citrate, dextrin and pectin, while those of the lubricant include magnesium stearate, talc, polyethylene glycol, silica and hardened vegatable oils. The coloring agent may be any one which is permitted to be added to drugs. Examples of the corrigent include cacao powder, mentha herb, aromatic powder, mentha oil, borneol and powdered cinnamon bark. Of course, these tablets and granules may be, if necessary, coated with sugar, gelatin or the like.</p>
    <p>The injection can be prepared by mixing an active principle with pH adjusting agent, buffer, stabilizer, solubilizing agent or the like and treating the obtained mixture according to an ordinary process to obtain a subcutaneous, intramuscular for intravenous injection.</p>
