    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>This invention relates to methods and apparatuses for providing treatment or promoting health through the application of electromagnetic radiation or electric current to the body and in particular to methods and apparatuses for providing therapeutic treatment and promoting health of the body or for treating food, chemical, vitamin, mineral, metal, and biological sensitivities, through the application of electromagnetic radiation to the body in the form of signals of nonionizing, nonthermal, low energy, frequency specific electromagnetic radiation or low voltage alternating or direct current.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The development of an ohmmeter to define the electronic characteristics of acupuncture points began with the discoveries by Yoshio Nakatani in Japan (Nakatani, 1956) and J. E. H. Niboyet (Niboyet, 1958), Bratu (Bratu, 1960), Brunet (Brunet, 1959, 1960), Voll (Voll 1976-7, 1980, 1978, 1983) and Wing (Wing, 1977) in Europe. They discovered that the acupuncture points were characterized by a lower resistance than the surrounding skin.</p>
    <p>The measurement of the electrical properties of acupuncture points is based on scientific concepts and formulas (Reichmanis 1975, 1977, Tiller 1982, Chen 1996). The electrical properties of the skin and of the acupuncture points have been studied for years (Rosendal 1943, Nakatani 1956, Niboyet 1958, Lawler 1960, Zhu 1981, Tsuei 1996). Studies have shown that each acupuncture point has a lower resistance (higher conductance) than the surrounding skin. Commercial equipment has been developed to exploit the resistance properties of the acupuncture points (Saita 1973, Borsarello 1971, Tiller 1972, Matsumoto 1973, Voll 1978, Schimmel 1980).</p>
    <p>The commercial equipment used the results of research (Rosendal 1943, Nakatani 1956, Niboyet 1958, Tiller 1972, Tsuei 1996) to define the parameters of the resistance values. The research found that a healthy or balanced subject has an optimal resistance value of 100,000 ohms. Lower resistance values correlate with inflammation processes in the body and higher resistance values correlated with degenerative processes in the body (Tsuei 1996).</p>
    <p>Commercial equipment thus allows the operator to measure the resistance value at selected acupuncture points. It has been noted that if an operator places a substance near the subject, with all other variables unchanged, and repeats the measurement and the resistance value is balanced, then the substance is considered a source of balancing. If the resistance value was more unbalanced, then the substance is considered a source of provoking.</p>
    <p>The substance could be anything found in nature or manufactured, including food, chemical, animal dander, pollen, pharmaceutical drug, homeopathic remedy, herbal, vitamin, mineral or biological organism. Fritz-Albert Popp, a German physicist, has investigated the resonance frequencies of substances and their actions in biological self-regulation. The nervous and chemical systems of the body are recognized as important mechanisms for the self-regulation of the body. Popp and his associates have presented the concept of another bio-information mechanism where the changes in the coherent electromagnetic fields of localized tissue produce bio-photon emissions (Popp, 1979, Popp, 1983). Kuo-Gen Chen, a Professor of Physics at Soochow University in Taiwan, considers that the primary mechanism is the changes in the quantum states of the tissue (Chen, 1996). The interactions to stimuli are at the molecular level (Popp 1979, Popp, 1983, Becker 1990).</p>
    <p>A stimulus is anything that can produce a biological response or effect, a bioeffect, and can include any physiological or anatomical change from enzyme production to music to x-rays to emotions. All the bioeffects from electrical and magnetic energy are studied in the field of Bioelectromagnetics (BEM). An article from the National Institute of Health (NIH) summarizes the past research on BEM (Rubik, 1996). The report establishes that low energy signals produce a bioeffect (Tenforde 1987). The NIH articles states that in basic BEM research "Nonionizing, nonthermal exogenous EM fields exert measurable bioeffects in living organisms. In general, the organism's response to applied EM fields is highly frequency specific and the dose-response curve is nonlinear (i.e., application of an additional amount of the EM field does not elicit a response of equal magnitude; the response eventually diminishes no matter how additional EM stimuli are applied). Extremely weak EM fields may, at the proper frequency and site of application, produce large effects that are either clinically beneficial or harmful."</p>

The sequence of digital values is used to generate highly frequency specific, nonionizing, nonthermal low energy signals in the form of electromagnetic radiation or electric current to cause a positive health effect on the body of a subject. The signals include all those frequencies from direct current to infrared that are nonionizing as shown in Table 1 below.</p>

From Rubik, 1996.</pre>
    
    <p>The purpose of the signal is to resonate with the body at the cellular level. Studies have established that the body is changed by small amounts of electrical and magnetic energy that form a resonant signal with the body (Popp 1979, Rubik 1994).</p>
    <p>The source of the resonant signal is a series of digital zeros and ones and is called a product capsule. A product signal is generated based upon the product capsule. A "zero" value in the sequence of numbers comprising the product capsule, results in a zero amplitude wave at the corresponding point in the product signal. A "one" results in a non-zero voltage amplitude wave of a selected value, such as 5 volts, at the corresponding point in the product signal. A product capsule can be made that simulates the resonance of any product, where the sequence of zeros and ones in the capsule is selected by measuring the electrical resistance of an acupuncture point using a sample of the product and then finding a product capsule, by trial and error, that causes the same response in the subject.</p>
    <p>The process is like listening to a piano and making a digital circuit produce the same sound. The process is begun by measuring the base resistance reading at an acupuncture point or other test point or series of test points on the body of the person. Then a sample of a product is introduced to the person that changes the resistance readings. After the sample is removed, a product capsule is made of a specific sequence of binary zeros and ones so the sequence results in the generation of a product signal which causes the same changes in the resistance readings at the test points as the product. For certain preferred embodiments, the capsule will be ten bytes or eighty bits in length. For other preferred embodiments the capsule will be whatever length is required for the binary sequence which simulates the product. The sequence is set with a computer program that enables the change of each bit in a capsule.</p>
    <p>The dose or dilution is also managed as a capsule. The NIH stated that "the dose-response curve is nonlinear." In pharmaceuticals and homeopathics, the amount of the substance is important (Benveniste 1993). In pharmaceuticals, the amount is based on the mass of the body. In homeopathics, the amount is based on the resonant imbalance of the body. In homeopathics, the more diluted the substance, the more energetic the substance. A capsule is created for each desired dilution value.</p>
    <p>A Digital Conductance Meter Receiver, a DCMR, is attached to the serial port of a computer which contains the software to operate the apparatus of the present invention. The DCMR enables the computer to interface with an ohmmeter and the other components. The DCMR communicates with the ohmmeter by RF signal. The DCMR generates product signals based upon the product capsules selected from the product capsule library stored in the attached computer. The product signals are applied to the body of the subject by the DCMR through RF transmission from an internal antenna located in the DCMR, by an infrared transmitter connected to the DCMR, or by a wire which transmits a current to one or more pads on the desired area of application on the body of the subject. Alternatively, selected product capsules and dilution capsules are down loaded to a portable, hand held Personal Capsule Unit, a PCU, or to a portable, hand held Personal Tens Unit, a PTU, where they are used for remote generation and application of product signals to the subject, by RF transmission, infrared transmission, other electromagnetic signals, audio signals including musical signals, or electric current. Other optional components include a capsule imprinter unit for exposing substances to product signals and an affirm unit for producing an audio signal which comprises a message recorded by the subject played for one ear and a product signal for the other ear. An optional capsule generator unit can also provide greater flexibility and control in the frequency and intensity of product signals and in the construction of series of product signals.</p>
    <p>For certain preferred embodiments, the bits of the product capsule and the dilution capsule produce a changing voltage that produces a square wave with a modulated frequency. The body has components that are equivalent to an RC circuit (Tiller 1972, Chen 1996). The invention uses the RC characteristic of the body. Since the RC component has slow response, the signal resonates. The body receives the resonating signal of the capsules at the cellular level. The NIH article (Rubik 1996) presents research that proposes the cell membrane as the primary site of transduction of EM field bioeffects and states "Relevant mechanisms may include changes in cell-membrane binding and transport processes, displacement or deformation of polarized molecules, modifications in the conformation of biological water (i.e., water that comprises organisms), and others." Dumitrescu (Dumitrescu 1971) has stated that the change can be in the anatomy and physiology of the organs and tissues of the body.</p>
    <p>Capsules have been made by the present inventor for about 40,000 products. The capsules have been shown to produce a balance that may last for only a few seconds, may last for a longer period of time, or may be permanent.</p>
    <p>The various methods of application, which include an antenna, an infrared transmitter, a speaker, fiber optic cable or direct electrical contact allows the capsules to be applied at varying distances from the body and for varying durations.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p>The present invention provides for the application of a resonant electromagnetic signal or current to the human body or to a specific area of the body. The resonant signals are designed to cause a response effect in the body of the subject which is identical to or approximates the effect of a stimulus, which is referred to herein as a "product". For preferred embodiments, the simulated product will be a natural or manufactured substance such as a food, a chemical, animal dander, pollen, pharmaceutical drug, homeopathic remedy, herb, vitamin, mineral, or a biological organism. These signals are applied for a therapeutic treatment or for promoting health of the body. Examples of therapeutic treatment and health promoting purposes includes treatment of food, chemical, vitamin, a mineral, metal and biological sensitivities. Preferred embodiments utilize electromagnetic radiation signals or electric currents at frequencies and intensities which are non ionizing, non thermal and are frequency specific.</p>
    <p>An example of a product signal is shown in FIG. 1. For this example, the product signal 3 consists of a series of square waves 7 of uniform amplitude 4 and a wavelength 6. Voltage is represented on the vertical axis 1 and time/distance is represented by the horizontal axis 2.</p>
    <p>Other embodiments may utilize electromagnetic signals with different wave forms such as sinusoidal waves or triangular waves. In addition to varying the amplitude between zero volts and a pre-selected fixed positive voltage to correspond to the product capsule, the wavelength or frequency may also be varied as desired to provide a product signal which enhances the match of the response to the response of the simulated product.</p>
    <p>Other embodiments may also provide for the administration of electric current to a point of application, to illicit the desired response. These embodiments may utilize alternating current or direct current. FIG. 2 illustrates a typical direct current product signal 8. For these embodiments the maximum current 9 and the form of the current curve 10 can be varied to equate or approximate the product response for the product being simulated.</p>
    <p>Referring again to FIG. 1, for most preferred embodiments of the present invention a product signal is derived from a sequence of digital zeroes and ones, known as a product capsule. The digital values are manifested in the product signal as the amplitudes of a series of waves 7 which have a zero amplitude 11 or a pre-selected non-zero amplitude 12 depending upon whether the corresponding value in the product capsule sequence at the signal point 13 is zero or one. Alternatively, for other embodiments, the minimum signal voltage 14 can be a positive value or a negative value. Also, as indicated above, other wave forms can be used in half cycle or full cycle wave forms. For example, a product signal can be comprised of a series of half cycle or full cycle sinusoidal waves with either a zero amplitude or a pre-selected amplitude at each specific signal point depending upon whether the corresponding product capsule value is a zero or one at that signal point.</p>
    <p>For preferred embodiments product signals are generated as highly frequency specific, non ionizing, non thermal low energy signals in the form of electromagnetic radiation or electric current. For preferred embodiments, the signals include all electromagnetic radiation frequencies from very low frequency radiation to infrared that are nonionizing. Weakly ionizing frequencies may also be used for certain embodiments for specific treatment purposes. While strongly ionizing frequencies might be used to achieve certain specific purposes, the negative effects of such radiation is considered by the inventor to offset any possible benefit. DC current or AC current of a wide range of frequencies is also used for certain preferred embodiments. The product signal is selected to resonate with the body at the cellular level.</p>
    <p>A product signal can be generated which simulates the resonance effect of any product. The sequence of zeroes and ones in the product capsule for a particular product is selected by comparing the response of the body at selected points, typically acupoints, to the product signal being tested and the response at the same points of the product being simulated.</p>
    <p>For certain preferred embodiments, the process of determining a product capsule which can be used to generate a product signal which causes a body response which equals or approximates the response of the body to a specific substance or product begins with the measurement of the electrical resistance at selected test points, which are commonly acupoints. When a sample of the product to be simulated is introduced into the presence of a subject, changes in the resistance reading at one or more of the test points on the body of the subject will normally occur. After the sample of the product to be simulated is removed, trial product capsules are constructed from binary zeroes and ones from which product signals are generated and tested on a trial and error basis until a product capsule is found from which a product signal is generated which produces the same change in resistance at the test points as the substance which is to be simulated. For certain preferred embodiments, the product capsule will be ten bytes or eighty bytes in length. However, any length of signal can be used which results in a closer response match by a product signal as compared to the product. The sequence of zeroes and ones which comprises the product capsule is then input to a computer program that enables the generation on demand of a product signal in the form of an electromagnetic signal or electric current corresponding to the digital values of the product capsule.</p>
    <p>The dose or dilution of the product signal is also managed as a dilution capsule. A dilution capsule is created for each desired dilution value. For certain preferred embodiments, the dilution capsule is made up of the logarithm of the desired dilution value times the power of dilution. For example, for a homeopathic remedy with a desired dilution of 5x, the value is 5 and the power, x, is 10 which gives a result of 50. The log of 50 is 1.699.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 3, while certain embodiments incorporate computational capabilities which allow the apparatus of the present invention to stand alone, because of cost considerations most preferred embodiments rely on an interconnection 26 &amp; 40 with a personal computer, a PC 15, or a network. When a Personal Capsule Unit, a PCU 20 or a Personal Tens Unit, a PTU 21, is used, an interface with a computer 15 is needed only periodically to allow updates or changes in the product capsules and dilution capsules stored in the PCU or PTU. When neither a PCU or a PTU is utilized, an active interface with a computer is required for these preferred embodiments.</p>
    <p>Certain preferred embodiments use a product capsule and a dilution capsule together to produce a series of wave forms of changing voltage that is embodied in a product signal. Under certain preferred embodiments, the product signal is a series of square waves as illustrated in FIG. 1. The human body has electrical characteristics that result in a response to a electromagnetic signal, whether as electromagnetic radiation or as electric current, which is similar to that of a RC circuit. The present invention uses the RC characteristic of the body. Since the RC component slows the response to the product signal, the signal resonates. The body receives the resonating signal of the product capsules at the cellular level which leads to the therapeutic or health benefit effect.</p>
    <p>Preferred embodiments of the method of the present invention include the following steps. A product capsule is selected based on a particular therapy or benefit desired and a dilution capsule is selected to provide the desired strength of the product signal to be applied. The product capsule and the dilution capsule are used together to produce a product signal with the desired sequence of waves and the desired amplitude. This product signal is then applied to the body with the intent to produce a specific desired response.</p>
    <p>The initial step in certain preferred embodiments of the method of the present invention is to determine the electrical resistance of one or more selected acupoints or other specific application points, if the product signal is to be applied to a specific area of the body of the subject 18, or to determine the electrical resistance of a number of test points, if the product signal is to be applied generally to the entire body of the subject. Referring again to FIG. 3, this is accomplished for most embodiments through use of a specially designed hand held ohmmeter, referred to herein as a Digital Conductance Meter, a DCM 19, which measures the resistance at a test point 17 through a test probe 41 placed against the skin at the test point. A ground probe is generally grasped in the hand of the subject on the side of the subject's body opposite the test point. The resistance measurement 40 is then transmitted to a Digital Conductance Meter Receiver, a DCMR 16. For certain preferred embodiments, a Digital Conductance Meter Footpedal, a DCMF 30, is used by the operator to activate and deactivate the resistance measurement transmission to the DCMR as a resistance measurement is taken. The DCMF increases the ease of operation of the DCM by the operator and also makes it possible for the subject to make a resistance measurement on his own body and simultaneously transmit the measurement to the DCMR at a desired moment. The DCM transmits the resistance readings to the DCMR by air, wire or fiberoptic cable. For ease of operation, RF communication between the DCMF and the DCM, and between the DCM and the DCMR is utilized by most preferred embodiments. For the embodiment shown in FIG. 3, the DCMR receives the resistance readings and sends the data to the PC. Operating software in the PC provides storage of the resistance readings for comparison with the values after application of the product signal.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 3, the DCMR may also be periodically connected to an optional Personal Capsule Unit, a PCU 20, or an optional Personal Tens Unit, a PTU21. The PCU's and the PTU's are hand held, portable units used for the storage and subsequent remote administration of product signals to the body of a subject.</p>
    <p>The operating software contains the library of products and their corresponding product capsules. The dilution capsules are also contained in the operating software.</p>
    <p>The health care practitioner or other operator can select one or more product capsules and dilution capsules and the selected product capsules and dilution capsules are transmitted from the PC to the DCMR. The DCMR combines the product capsules and the dilution capsules in a manner determined by the operator and generates one or more product signals 28. The product signals may be generated as radio frequency signals 58 transmitted from a RF transmitter 42 in the DCMR. Certain preferred embodiments of the DCMR RF transmitter incorporate a special antenna specifically designed for optimum RF transmission of the product signals. Product signals may also be generated as infrared signals 47 from a separate infrared transmitter 27 connected by wire, fiber optic cable or RF communication with the DCMR. Similarly, a fiber optic applicator 43 may be used to administer a product signal in certain frequencies directly to a desired area of application on the body of the subject. Also, product signals may be applied directly to the body of the subject as a low voltage direct current 44 or a low voltage alternating current 45.</p>
    <p>For the embodiment shown in FIG. 3, product signals generated and transmitted by the DCMR are generated by the DCMR by utilizing product capsules and dilution capsules transmitted from the PC. Alternatively, for other preferred embodiments, one or more product capsules and one or more dilution capsules can be received by the DCMR from the PC and transmitted by the DCMR to a PCU where they are stored for later generation, transmission and administration of product signals to the body of a the subject. Referring to FIG. 4, product signals 25 may be generated, transmitted and applied by the PCU as RF 58, infrared 47, or other frequency waves or as direct current 44 or alternating current 45 in manners similar to that provided by direct application from the DCMR. Application of the PCU generated product signals can be by RF transmitter 42, wire 54 &amp; 55, separate connected infrared transmitter 27, or direct fiber optic cable 46 transmission. The storage of one or more product capsules and one or more dilution capsules in the PCU allows for remote and repetitive application of one or more desired product signals without an intervening interface with the DCMR and the PC. While the application of the desired product signal by a health practitioner can be readily accomplished by the embodiments shown in FIG. 3, for the subsequent repetitive application of product signals by the subject at times and locations desired by the subject or his health care practitioner, the small, portable PCU illustrated in FIG. 4 is needed.</p>
    <p>The PCU can also be used in conjunction with a Personal Tens Unit, a PTU 21, which is shown in FIG. 5, or the PTU can be connected directly to the DCMR as shown in FIG. 3. The PTU can be loaded with one or more product capsules and one or more dilution capsules either directly from the DCMR or from a PCU. The PTU is then used for the remote and repetitive generation, transmission and application of product signals in the form of direct current 44 or alternating current 45 at times and locations desired by the subject or his health care practitioner. The direct current or alternating current is typically transmitted by the PTU by wire 48 to electro pads 49 for tactile stimulation as shown in FIG. 5. The electric current generated by the PTU may follow a square wave pattern in a form similar to that shown in FIG. 1, or can be a half cycle or full cycle wave in a sinusoidal, triangular wave or other wave form or can follow a wave form similar to that shown in FIG. 2.</p>
    <p>Either or both the PCU and the PTU can be worn by the subject and can be programmed to administer one or more product signals at desired times with a desired number of repetitions. As with the DCMR, for preferred embodiments of the PCU, the frequency and the intensity of the product signal can be adjusted. Similarly, for preferred embodiments of the PTU, the frequency of the signal can be increased or decreased and the intensity of the product signal, and thus the applied current, can be increased or decreased as desired by the practitioner or the subject.</p>
    <p>Certain preferred embodiments also include a capsule imprinter unit, a CIU 23, as shown on FIG. 3. A capsule imprinter unit is used to apply one or more product signals to a selected substance. Referring to FIG. 6, the CIU has a well 50 where the selected substance 51 can be placed. The CIU is then connected to a DCMR or a PCU as shown in FIG. 3. Selected product capsules and dilution capsules 28 or selected product signals are transmitted by the DCMR or PCU to the CIU. The product signal is then applied to the substance in the well by antenna emission of the product signal or by passing the product signal through a coil surrounding the substance. A product signal can be reapplied to the substance as many times as desired or a series of product signals can be applied to the substance. The CUI may also contain two or more wells 50 as shown in FIG. 6, thereby providing for simultaneous or alternating application of the same or different product signals or series of product signals to one or more substances.</p>
    <p>Certain preferred embodiments of the CIU incorporate a wall transformer 52 as shown in FIG. 6. For certain preferred embodiments, a plurality of wells of varying sizes may be incorporated to accommodate varying quantities of the selected substances from as small as a fraction of a gram up to several grams or more. Certain embodiments of the CIU incorporate an output jack to which a conductor or fiberoptic cable is connected for transmitting product signals to an optional soft or hard coil that can accommodate a larger quantity of the substance to be imprinted. Some preferred embodiments also incorporate one or more high intensity Xenon or other types of strobe lights to excite the substance to be imprinted and to show operation. The flash duration, intensity and frequency can be fixed or adjustable.</p>
    <p>Referring again to FIG. 3, a Capsule Generator Unit, a CGU 22 may be utilized with embodiments which operate with one or more product capsules and one or more dilution capsules transmitted from the DCMR or from a PCU. For preferred embodiments the CGU is a signal generator using digital circuitry to produce a product signal in a desired wave form based on product capsules and dilution capsules received from the DCMR or PCU. For certain preferred embodiments the CGU will generate product signals with a frequency in the range of 0.001 Hz to 3.5 MHZ. The frequency of the product signals can be adjusted by the practitioner or the subject by controls on the CGU. Also, certain preferred embodiments of the CGU, multiple frequencies can be selected within the range of the generator and controls can be used to switch between the multiple selected frequencies or to program a switch as desired by the practitioner or the subject. This can be used to attempt to maximize a response by fine tuning the frequency or can be used to apply a product signal at a selected frequency and at a harmonic frequency, alternatively. Preferred embodiments of the CGU also incorporate a selector switch for selection of a square wave, sine wave, bi-polar square wave, triangular wave, digital square wave or other wave forms. Output gain or signal strength for the product signals can also be digitally adjusted by the user. Typically the frequency selection and signal intensity are controlled by a digital keypad on the CGU.</p>
    <p>Referring further to FIG. 3, preferred embodiments of the present invention may also incorporate an affirm unit 34. An affirm unit is preferably a small hand held device with a verbal message loaded on it by the user. The affirm unit generates a resonate signal from an audio message 32 which is recorded 33 by the user. Under certain preferred embodiments of the method of the present invention, the user selects an interval time and the affirm unit plays the verbal message repeatedly for the user at the interval selected. Under preferred embodiments, the message 35 is played at the normal frequency of the voice of the user on one speaker 37 and a different resonate frequency 36 in the other speaker 38.</p>
    <p>The operating software program which is loaded in the PC allows the user to select the product and dilution capsules and to output one or more product capsules, one or more dilution capsules to the DCMR.
