    <heading>RELATED APPLICATION</heading> <p num="P-00002">The present application is a divisional of application Ser. No. 09/058,547 filed on Apr. 10, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,369,709.</p>
    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="P-00003">The present invention relates to a library terminal which may be used, for example, by borrowers to check circulating items out of, and/or to return circulating items, to, a library.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="P-00004">Many businesses and other enterprises are increasingly automating their systems in order to reduce operating cost and improve service. When such systems are used by the customers of these businesses and other enterprises, automation typically involves self-service facilities which allow customers to satisfy their own requirements. For example, financial institutions and library systems are beginning to use self-service terminals in order to reduce costs and to improve service. In the case of libraries, the libraries' patrons may use these self-service library terminals to conduct at least some of their business with the libraries.</p>
    <p num="P-00005">Known self-service library terminals typically include a cradle on which circulating items to be checked out from, or returned to, a library can be placed. A scanner reads a code, such as a bar code, which has been placed on the circulating item by library staff and which identifies the circulating item. Typically the scanner projects a visible scan line in order to read the code. The visible scan line used by current scanners do little more than read codes, and are not arranged to provide information back to library patrons. Accordingly, known self-service library terminals are under-utilized.</p>
    <p num="P-00006">Known self-service library terminals also do not lead a user through a loan transaction and do not provide feedback to the user regarding the proper use of the self-service library terminal. For example, known self-service library terminals do not indicate to the user when a circulating item has been placed in an improper position on the cradle.</p>
    <p num="P-00007">Moreover, when known self-service library terminals are configured according to the specifications of a particular library, the configuration data is not conveniently generated and distributed to each of the self-service library terminals provided by a library. Accordingly, unnecessary expense and time consuming labor are required to configure the self-service library terminals of a library.</p>
    <p num="P-00008">In addition, known self-service library terminals typically rely on only one circulating item receiving area, such as a cradle, in order to receive circulating items whose codes are to be scanned by the scanner during check out and/or check in. This limitation means that either current self-service library terminals are limited in the types of circulating items which can be checked out and/or checked in by the patron without the help of a member of the library staff, or library staff must be careful about the placement of codes on the circulating items and patrons must be careful about the placement of the different kinds of circulating items on the cradle so that their codes may be properly scanned.</p>
    <p num="P-00009">Furthermore, known library self-service terminals have many other limitations. For example, (i) known self-service library terminals do not process financial credit transactions, (ii) they do not store loan transaction information during periods when the communication link between the terminal and the main circulation system of the library is down so that this loan transaction information can be later transferred to the main circulation system when the communication link is back up, (iii) they do not determine incorrect placement of a patron's library card on the cradle so that the identification of the patron processing a check out or check in transaction can be determined, and (iv) they do not permit a library patron to continue a transaction at the option of the patron if the self-service library terminal is in an error state.</p>
    <p num="P-00010">The present invention is directed to a library terminal that solves one or more of the above noted problems.</p>

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading> <p num="P-00038">A self-service library terminal <b>10</b> is illustrated in FIG. <b>1</b>. The self-service library terminal <b>10</b> has a housing <b>12</b> forming a cradle <b>14</b>, which also may be referred to as a first circulating item receiving area. The cradle <b>14</b> is arranged to receive a circulating item such as a book, a magazine, a CD, and/or the like, and has an idle indicator <b>16</b>. The idle indicator <b>16</b>, for example, may be a bar code, may be referred to herein as a default bar code, and may be provided in a card holder of the cradle <b>14</b>. This card holder may be used by the library patron to hold the patron's library card when the patron is entering the patron's ID at the beginning of a loan transaction. A reader <b>18</b> is supported on the housing <b>12</b> and is arranged to read item identifiers or codes, such as bar codes, on the circulating items and library cards placed on the cradle <b>14</b>. For example, the reader <b>18</b> may be a scanner such as a bar code scanner. The reader <b>18</b> also reads the idle indicator <b>16</b> in order to determine, for example, when a library card or a circulating item is or is not on the cradle <b>14</b>. The reader <b>18</b> may additionally be arranged to read other features, such as dimensions, of a library card and/or a circulating item.</p>
    <p num="P-00039">Photoelectric sensors <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> are suitably affixed to the cradle <b>14</b> and are used to sense circulating items on the cradle <b>14</b>. For example, when the reader <b>18</b> reads the idle indicator <b>16</b> on the cradle <b>14</b>, and neither of the photoelectric sensors <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> is covered, the self-service library terminal <b>10</b> determines that a circulating item is not placed on the cradle <b>14</b>. On the other hand, if the reader <b>18</b> reads the idle indicator <b>16</b> and one of the photoelectric sensors <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> is covered, or if the reader <b>18</b> does not read the idle indicator <b>16</b> and one or both of the photoelectric sensors <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> are covered, the self-service library terminal <b>10</b> determines that a circulating item is placed on the cradle <b>14</b> but is not in the proper position. Thus, a circulating item is in the proper position when its identifier on the circulating item is read by the reader <b>18</b> and both of the photoelectric sensors <b>22</b> and <b>20</b> are covered.</p>
    <p num="P-00040">As is also known, a security marker may be provided in or on a circulating item. This security marker typically is a magnetic strip which is placed in the spine and/or along an edge of a circulating item. The security marker can be desensitized when a circulating item is properly checked out by a library patron so that exit scanners will not provide an alarm as the patron passes out of an exit of the library. On the other hand, if the security marker is not desensitized before the circulating item passes through the exit scanners, an alarm will be given to alert the library staff. During check in, the security marker of a circulating item is re-sensitized so that, if the circulating item is not properly checked out before an attempt is made to remove the circulating item from the library, an alarm will be given. Accordingly, the self-service library terminal <b>10</b> can include a sensitizer/desensitizer <b>24</b> which is provided in a back wall <b>26</b> of the housing <b>12</b> and which interacts with the security marker. For example, the security marker may be a magnetic security marker, and the sensitizer/desensitizer <b>24</b> may be arranged to magnetize or de-magnetize the magnetic security marker. The sensitizer/desensitizer <b>24</b> also may be arranged to read the magnetic state of the security marker during multiple book detection and/or to determine the appropriate sensitizing/desensitizing range of the sensitizer/desensitizer <b>24</b>.</p>
    <p num="P-00041">In order for the sensitizer/desensitizer <b>24</b> to operate properly, the portion of the circulating item having the security marker must be against the back wall <b>26</b> of the cradle <b>14</b>. The item identifier which uniquely identifies a circulating item is placed by the library staff on the circulating item so that, when the reader <b>18</b> reads the item identifier on the circulating item, and when the photoelectric sensors <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> are covered, the portion of the circulating item having the security marker must be against the sensitizer/desensitizer <b>24</b>. Thus, when the reader <b>18</b> fails to read either the item identifier of a circulating item or the idle indicator <b>16</b>, and when the photoelectric sensors <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> are covered, then either the circulating item has been placed on the cradle <b>14</b> so that the portion of the circulating item having the security marker is not against the sensitizer/desensitizer <b>24</b>, or the circulating item must be slid sufficiently along the back wall <b>26</b> to enable the reader <b>18</b> to read the item identifier on the circulating item.</p>
    <p num="P-00042">In the case where the reader <b>18</b> is a scanner such as a bar code scanner, the visible scan line projected by the reader <b>18</b> may be used to indicate proper placement of the circulating item on the cradle <b>14</b> so that the identifier on the circulating item may be read. Thus, this scan line helps guide the patron in properly positioning the circulating item on the cradle <b>14</b>. Also, the self-service library terminal <b>10</b> has a display <b>28</b> which is used to provide instructions to the patron regarding proper placement of a circulating item on the cradle <b>14</b> in response to feedback from the reader <b>18</b> and the photoelectric sensors <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>. Also, the display <b>28</b> may be used to provide other information to the patron.</p>
    <p num="P-00043">The self-service library terminal <b>10</b> may also be provided with a video slot <b>30</b>, which may also be referred to as a second circulating item receiving area. The video slot <b>30</b> may be used to receive such circulating items as videos and the like. The self-service library terminal <b>10</b> further has a keypad <b>32</b>, a magnetic stripe reader <b>34</b>, a printer (not shown in FIG. <b>1</b>), a printer slot <b>36</b>, a proximity sensor <b>38</b>, and an audible transducer <b>40</b>. The keypad <b>32</b> may be used by a patron to enter appropriate data. The magnetic stripe reader <b>34</b> may be used, for example, to read a magnetic stripe on a patron's library card, debit card, credit card, or the like. The patron may present the magnetic stripe of a library card to the magnetic stripe reader <b>34</b> so that the patron processing a transaction at the self-service library terminal <b>10</b> may be identified. The magnetic stripe reader <b>34</b> may also be used to read a magnetic stripe on a patron's debit card or credit card in order to process a financial transaction involving the patron. The printer may be used to issue printed matter through the printer slot <b>36</b>. For example, the printer may be used to print various items such as system diagnostics, receipts based on financial transactions conducted by library patrons, or receipts for circulating items being checked out indicating the date by which the circulating items should be checked in. The proximity sensor <b>38</b> may be used to detect when a library patron has approached the self-service library terminal <b>10</b>, and the audible transducer <b>40</b> may be used to provide audible feedback to the patron. The housing <b>12</b> may also be provided with a cash slot <b>42</b> that may be used to receive and dispense cash involved in financial transactions. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the cash slot <b>42</b> is a separate box which is in communication with the self-service library <b>10</b> terminal by way of a connection in the rear of the housing <b>12</b>. Alternatively, the cash slot <b>42</b> may be formed integrally with the self-service library <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p num="P-00044">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a circulation system <b>48</b> of a library typically has multiple terminals some or all of which may be self-service library terminals such as the self-service library terminal <b>10</b> shown in FIG. <b>1</b>. Accordingly, the circulation system <b>48</b> includes a data server <b>50</b> and a plurality of library terminals <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, . . . n which, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, are interconnected in a star configuration. However, it should be understood that the data server <b>50</b> and the library terminals <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, . . . n may be instead interconnected in any network configuration. The data server <b>50</b> is at the hub of the star and, for example, may include the functions of a main circulation terminal and/or an administration terminal which are used by library staff in order to administer the circulating system <b>48</b> in which the library terminals <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, . . . n are used. Indeed, for the discussion below, it is assumed that the data server <b>50</b> performs the function of an administration terminal.

    <p num="P-00046">Configuration data may be generated by use of one of the library terminals shown in FIG. <b>2</b>. If the data server <b>50</b> performs the functions of an administration terminal, the configuration data can be generated there.

    <p num="P-00048">The components housed by the housing <b>12</b> of the self-service library terminal <b>10</b> are illustrated in FIG. <b>3</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the self-service library terminal <b>10</b> includes a microprocessor <b>60</b> and a memory <b>62</b> associated therewith. The memory <b>62</b> may include, for example, a RAM <b>64</b> and a ROM <b>66</b>. The microprocessor <b>60</b> also has I/O ports <b>68</b> in order to receive information from, and to provide information to, various devices. For example, the microprocessor <b>60</b> receives information from the reader <b>18</b>, the photoelectric sensors <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>, the keypad <b>32</b>, the magnetic stripe reader <b>34</b>, and the proximity sensor <b>38</b>. The information from these devices is read by the microprocessor <b>60</b> through the I/O ports <b>68</b>.</p>
    <p num="P-00049">The microprocessor <b>60</b> also provides information to the display <b>28</b>, the audible transducer <b>40</b>, and the printer <b>70</b> through the I/O ports <b>68</b>. Accordingly, the microprocessor <b>60</b>, for example, provides screen displays and other information for display by the display <b>28</b>, feedback and other information for transmission by the audible transducer <b>40</b>, and information to be printed by the printer <b>70</b>. A communication link <b>72</b> is provided so that the microprocessor <b>60</b> can transmit and receive information to and from other self-service library terminals and/or the data server <b>50</b>. For example, the microprocessor <b>60</b> may be arranged to determine whether the communication link <b>72</b> is down at any time that it needs to communicate with the data server <b>50</b> over the communication link <b>72</b>. During periods when the communication link <b>72</b> is down, the microprocessor <b>60</b> stores in the memory <b>62</b> any loan transaction information that it is required to communicate to the data server <b>50</b> so that this loan transaction information can be later transferred to the data server <b>50</b> when the communication link <b>72</b> is back Up. A reader <b>74</b>, which may be similar to the reader <b>18</b> and which is housed in the housing <b>12</b>, is provided for reading item identifiers on videos that are inserted by the library patron into the video slot <b>30</b>.</p>
    <p num="P-00050">The microprocessor <b>60</b> executes a program represented by the flow charts shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-29</figref>. The flow chart shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> governs start-up of the self-service library terminal <b>10</b> when the self-service library terminal <b>10</b> is used only for checkout of circulating items. At start-up, if the staff of the library in which the self-service library terminal <b>10</b> is used determines that the self-service library terminal <b>10</b> is not to be used during a particular time period, then the microprocessor <b>60</b> at a block <b>102</b> retrieves an out-of-service screen display SCR-<b>28</b> from the memory <b>62</b> and displays that out-of-service screen display on the display <b>28</b>. On the other hand, if the microprocessor <b>60</b> detects an error at start up, then the microprocessor <b>60</b> as indicated by a block <b>104</b> retrieves an error condition out-of-service screen display SCR-<b>82</b> from the memory <b>62</b> and displays this error condition out-of-service screen display on the display <b>28</b>.

As a yet further alternative, or in addition to any of the alternatives described above, the scan line projected by the reader <b>18</b> is changed from a first state to a second state when a sensor, such as the proximity sensor <b>38</b>, detects the presence of a patron at the self-service library terminal <b>10</b>. For example, the first state may be off and the second state may be on, or the first state may be steady and the second state may be blinking, or the first state may be blinking and the second state may be steady, or the first state may be long and the second state may be short, or the first state may be short and the second state may be long, or the like.</p>

Alternatively, the terminal <b>50</b> can be arranged to function as both a self-service library terminal and a gateway.</p>
    <p num="P-00161">Also, as described above, the scan line projected by the reader <b>18</b> may be long and steady, long and flashing, short and steady, and short and flashing. However, the scan line projected by the reader <b>18</b> may be controlled so that it has different blink rates.</p>
    <p num="P-00162">In addition, as described above, the microprocessor <b>60</b> provides a sad tone, a happy tone, and a walk-away tone through use of the audible transducer <b>40</b>. The microprocessor <b>60</b> may also be arranged to control the audible transducer <b>40</b> so as to provide a tone indicating that the self-service library terminal <b>10</b> requires non-walk-away servicing, such as servicing because the printer <b>70</b> is out of paper.</p>
    <p num="P-00163">Moreover, various maximum event timers have been described above such that, when they time out, program flow proceeds to a predetermined point in the program. As an interim step, however, the library patron may first be asked whether the patron needs additional time. If the patron does not respond within a fixed amount of time, program flow proceeds to the predetermined point in the program. On the other hand, if the patron does respond within the fixed amount of time, the patron is given additional time before program flow proceeds to the predetermined point in the program. Also, the self-service library terminal <b>10</b> may be arranged to block the patron's library card if the patron does not respond within the patron's allotted time.</p>
    <p num="P-00164">Furthermore, as described above, the microprocessor <b>60</b> is arranged to detect a printer error state. Likewise, the microprocessor <b>60</b> may be arranged to detect error states other than printer error states. For example, an error state may occur when the communication link <b>72</b> is down, or when the reader <b>18</b> or the reader <b>74</b> is out of service. In any of these error states, the library patron may be given the option of continuing or not continuing with a loan transaction, or the microprocessor <b>60</b> may be arranged to simply block the current loan transaction. If any part of the self-service library terminal <b>10</b> is out of service, the self-service library terminal <b>10</b> may be arranged to notify the patron which part is out of service.</p>
    <p num="P-00165">Also, as described above, the cradle <b>14</b> is arranged to receive both a book and a CD. Instead, a separate receiving area may be provided in the housing <b>12</b> for receiving CD's.</p>
    <p num="P-00166">In addition, if the self-service library terminal <b>10</b> is enabled to process a chargeable loan, and if the patron agrees to the charge, the patron is allowed to proceed. However, if the patron does not agree to the charge, the patron is instructed to remove the circulating item and the patron is not permitted to continue with that circulating item. Instead, the self-service library terminal <b>10</b> may be arranged to allow the patron to continue checking out a circulating item even if the patron does not agree to pay a loan fee or fine. Similarly, the self-service library terminal <b>10</b> may be arranged to remind the patron of previous exacted fines and of other circulating items that the patron has on hold and that the patron has not yet checked out.</p>
    <p num="P-00167">Moreover, as described above, the photoelectric sensors <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> are used to sense circulating items on the cradle <b>14</b>. Instead, other types of proximity sensors may be used to sense circulating items on the cradle <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p num="P-00168">Furthermore, as described above, a library patron may choose one of three ways (the keypad <b>32</b>, the reader <b>18</b>, or the magnetic stripe reader <b>34</b>) to enter the patron's identification. Instead, the library in which the self-service library terminal <b>10</b> is used may restrict the patron to only one mode or may provide the patron with any number of identification modes greater than or less than three.</p>
    <p num="P-00169">Also, more photoelectric sensors than the photoelectric sensors <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> may be used on the cradle <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p num="P-00170">Accordingly, the description of the present invention is to be construed as illustrative only and is for the purpose of teaching those skilled in the art the best mode of carrying out the invention. The details may be varied substantially without departing from the spirit of the invention, and the exclusive use of all modifications which are within the scope of the appended claims is reserved.</p>
