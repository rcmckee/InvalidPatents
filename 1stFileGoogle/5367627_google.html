More particularly, a computerized system incorporating a data storage device, a display apparatus, a part selection device and a user interface mechanism enhances the efforts of a parts salesman. The data storage device electronically stores graphic and textual partsrelated information including specifications, features and customer benefits. The display apparatus electronically displays portions of the graphic and textual information in order to provide training and sales assistance related to part features and customer benefits. The part selection device electronically selects a particular part by navigating through part choices menus based on stored part specifications. The user interface mechanism controls the operation of the display apparatus and the part selection device parts so that each of the respective parts are operatively coupled and related to one another.</div>

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Traditionally, a parts salesperson must carry with him or her all of the sales tools related to the particular kinds of parts that they wish to sell. These tools include parts catalogs, sample parts, and parts order forms. To carry the combination of all of these sales tools can be very cumbersome for a salesperson. For a salesperson to bring all of these sales tools into a customer visit could be quite difficult. In particular, if a parts salesperson must bring in parts catalogs for several types of parts as well as several different manufacturers of parts, and in addition the corresponding samples of each type of part by each of the manufacturers, the salesperson may find this overwhelming and choose to limit the number of parts that they sell or the particular manufacturers that they sell for.</p>
    <p>Further, looking up a part number in a catalog can take significant amounts of time. In addition, trying to match a particular part with a particular need can be very difficult. For instance, trying to find a particular filter which will fit on a particular product may be impossible to accomplish in a limited amount of time. It can be even more difficult to determine all parts that a user with many types and brands of equipment may require. Further, the generation of a corresponding proposal or order, particularly a personalized one, has been difficult. An additional long felt need has been the need to educate sales people with respect to a particular product line of a manufacturer as well as the features and benefits of those particular products in comparison to other comparable products in a relatively quick and efficient manner.</p>
    <p>The preferred system seeks to overcome these problems by linking these and other functions into a single system.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>A computerized system is provided for providing a salesperson with assistance related to training and sales of parts corresponding to particular products. More particularly, a computerized system incorporating a data storage device, a display apparatus, a part selection device and a user interface mechanism is provided to enhance the efforts of a parts salesman. The data storage device electronically stores graphic and textual parts-related information including specifications, features and customer benefits. The display apparatus electronically displays portions of the graphic and textual information in order to provide training and sales assistance related to part features and customer benefits. The part selection device electronically selects a particular part by navigating through part choices menus based on stored Dart specifications. The user interface means controls the operation of the display apparatus and the part selection device parts so that each of the respective parts are operatively coupled and related to one another.</p>

In choosing a particular battery by battery description 254, preferred part selection device 106 will retrieve parts-related information by using cross-reference file 294 in combination with battery information 300 depicted in FIG. 6. The cross-reference file 294 and battery information 300 are stored in data storage device 104. The part selection device 106 displays battery description types 256. These description types may include BCI number, cold cranking amps, reserve capacity, voltage, length of battery, width of battery, height of battery, warranty period, and price of the battery. The part selection device 106 prompts a user to choose a description type 258. Upon a user specifying a particular parameter for the battery description 260, the part selection device 106 checks to see if the description is valid 262. If the description is not valid, then the parts selection device 106 returns to prompting the user to choose a description type 258. Otherwise, if the description is valid, the part selection device 106 displays the part information which is defined by the description entered 264. This part information may include more than one part if more than one part meets the constraints entered in the part description 260. A user typically will select as much of the battery description as is needed to specify only a few battery parts. Subsequently, preferred part selection device 106 prompts the user to select a particular part 266 from the displayed part information. Upon selection of the particular part, the part selection device accesses the cross-reference file 294 to retrieve the particular part information from battery information 300. Subsequently, the part selection device 106 ends the get part by description for battery procedure 268.</p>
    <p>Referring now more particularly to the filter cross-referencing section as depicted in FIG. 7, 8A, 8B, 9 and 10, a user may choose a filter by specifying a part number or equipment application. More particularly, FIG. 7 is a flow chart diagramming a preferred procedure for selecting a filter by a part number, and FIG. 10 shows a preferred embodiment file structure containing filter information stored in data storage device 104 for use in selecting a filter by part number. Upon selecting the choice of specifying a filter by part number 302, a user is prompted to enter a part number 304.</p>
    <p>Subsequently, part selection device 106 will check if the part number is valid 306. The validity checking is accomplished by finding an HPTR record in the HPTR file 381 which is substantially similar to the part number entered. The HPTR file 381 comprises HPTR records sorted in part number order. Each HPTR record comprises a pointer to a record within an HTAB file 380 comprising a part number. If the part number is not valid, part selection device 106 will prompt the user to enter a part number 304 once again.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, if the part number is valid, then part selection device 106 will display manufacturers of the part number 308 and prompt the user to select a manufacturer of the part number. The list of manufacturers displayed is derived from data storage device 104 by accessing the same record number in the DPTR file 383 as was found to be a valid part number in the validity checking. The DPTR file 383 comprises the same number of records as the HPTR file 381 sorted in the same order by part number. Each DPTR record includes a pointer 384 to a manufacturer in a MFGR file 386 and a pointer 385 to an XREF file 389. The XREF file 389 is a file sorted by part number comprising records including a pointer 390 into a record within DPTR file 383, a pointer into INFO file 388, a pointer 394 to another XREF record and the price 396 of the part.</p>
    <p>For example, a list of manufacturers is derived by taking HPTR record number (e.g., the record including pointer 382) of the valid part number and using it to access the same record number in the DPTR file 383. The record number in the DPTR file 383 corresponding to the same record number comprises a pointer (e.g. pointer 384) to a manufacturer of that part number. The manufacturer is retrieved by accessing the data in the record in the MFGR file 386 pointed to by the pointer (e.g. pointer 384). The DPTR file 383 record also includes a pointer (e.g. 385) to a record in the XREF file 389. This XREF record may include a pointer back into the DPTR file 383 (e.g. pointer 390) which includes a pointer (e.g. 387) to another record in the MFGR file 386 comprising manufacturer of that part. The process of looking up more records in the MFGR file 386 comprises searching records sequentially in the sorted DPTR file 383 until the HPTR 384 record is not related to the selected part number being considered for inclusion in the list of manufacturers. At this point the part selection device 106 knows all of the manufacturers of the part number entered.</p>
    <p>Upon selection of a manufacturer 310, the part selection device 106 will display the particular part information 312 and select a particular part. The part information is derived from the data storage device 104 by access information pointed to by the records of the DPTR file 383 associated with the part number entered. The specific part information is accessed from the records pointed to in the XREF file 389 and subsequently the record pointed to in the INFO file 388. Upon selection of a particular part 314, part selection device 106 accesses all of the needed filter information 388 stored in data storage device 104 to select a particular part. Subsequently, the part selection device 106 ends the procedure get part by part number for filter 316.</p>

Each record for info 1 data includes a pointer 360 to particular information for that particular info 1 data, a pointer 362 to the next record of info 1 data and a count of subobjects 364 for the set records related to that particular info 1 data record. The subsequent record following the first info 1 record is typically the first subobject related to the first info 1 record or more specifically a record related to info 2 data including a pointer 366 to the info 2 data and a pointer 368 to the next info 2 record also related to that particular info 1 data record which was selected. This hierarchy of records continues further down into the record including a pointer 370 to info 3 data. Similarly, the next record typically includes a pointer 372 to info 4 data, with the next record including a pointer 374 to info 5 data. Finally, the following record typically includes a pointer to an XREF record 376 for a particular filter, with the next record including a pointer to an XREF record 378 for another filter. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the above discussion was merely a simple example of what a structure form 358 might include. The form 358 might further include more records at each level of the hierarchy to accommodate addition part data in the structured form 358.</p>

The CHAIN2 file 662 comprises records including one or more pointers to records within XREF file 651.</p>
    <p>For example, part information is derived by taking HPTR record number (e.g. the record including pointer 638) of the valid part number and using it to access the same record number in the DPTR file 641. The record number in the DPTR file 641 corresponding to the same record number comprises a pointer (e.g. pointer 642) to a record in the XREF file 651. This XREF record includes a pointer into the INFO file 640 (e.g. pointer 652). As a result, the part information pointed to by pointer 652 in INFO file 651 can be retrieved for the display of part information 580.</p>
    <p>The specific part information is accessed from the records pointed to in the XREF file 651 and subsequently the record pointed to in the INFO file 640. Upon selection of a particular part 582, part selection device 106 accesses all of the needed bearing information stored in data storage device 104 to select a particular part. Subsequently, the part selection device 106 ends the procedure get part by part number for bearing 584.</p>
    <p>Alternatively a user may choose a bearing by OEM part number. FIG. 20 is a flow chart diagramming a procedure for selecting a bearing by an OEM part number and FIG. 23 shows a preferred embodiment file structure containing bearing information stored in data storage device 104 for use in selecting a bearing by part number. Upon selecting the choice of specifying a bearing by OEM part number 586, a user is prompted to enter a part number 588.</p>
    <p>Subsequently, part selection device 106 will check if the part number is valid 590. The validity checking is accomplished by finding an HPTR record in the HPTR file 637 which is substantially similar to the part number entered. The HPTR file 637 comprises HPTR records sorted in part number order. Each HPTR record comprises a pointer to a record within an HTAB file 636 comprising a part number. If the part number is not valid, part selection device 106 will prompt the user to enter a part number 588 once again.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, if the part number is valid then part selection device 106 will display manufacturers of the part number 592 and prompt the user to select a manufacturer of the part number. The list manufacturers displayed is derived from data storage device 104 by accessing the same record number in the DPTR file 641 as was found to be a valid part number in the validity checking. The DPTR file 641 comprises the same number of records as the HPTR file 637 sorted in the same order by part number. Each DPTR record includes a pointer 640 to a manufacturer in a MFGR file 644 and a pointer 642 to either a CHAIN1 file 646 when the selected part number is an OEM part number or to an XREF file 651 when the selected part number is not an OEM part number. The XREF file 651 is a file sorted by part number comprising records including a pointer 650 into a record within DPTR file 641, a pointer 652 into INFO file 640, a pointer 654 to CHAIN2 file 662 and the price 656 of the part. The CHAIN2 file 662 comprises records including one or more pointers to records within XREF file 651.</p>
    <p>For example, a list of manufacturers is derived by taking HPTR record number (e.g. the record including pointer 638) of the valid part number and using it to access the same record number in the DPTR file 641. The record number in the DPTR file 641 corresponding to the same record number comprises a pointer (e.g. pointer 640) to a manufacturer of that part number. The manufacturer is retrieved by accessing the data in the record in the MFGR file 644 pointed to by the pointer (e.g. pointer 640). The DPTR file 641 record also includes a pointer (e.g. pointer 642) to a record in the CHAIN1 file 646. This CHAIN1 file 646 may include one or more pointers to records in the XREF file 651. Each of these records pointed at may include pointers 650 which point back into the DPTR file 641 which includes a pointer (e.g. pointer 640) to a particular record in the MFGR file 644 comprising another manufacturer of that part. The process of looking up more records in the MFGR file 644 comprises searching records sequentially in the sorted DPTR file 641 until the HPTR file record corresponding to the DPTR file 641 record being considered for inclusion in the list of manufacturers is not related to the selected part number. At this point the part selection device 106 knows all of the manufacturers of the part number entered.</p>
    <p>Upon selection of a manufacturer 594, the part selection device 106 queries the user whether or not the user wants to enter another parts number 596. If the user wants to enter another parts number, the part selection device 106 will prompt the user to enter a part number 588. Otherwise, part selection means 106 displays the particular part information 598 and selects a particular part. The part information is derived from the data storage device 104 by accessing information pointed to by the records of the DPTR file 641 associated with the part number entered. The specific part information is accessed from the records pointed to in the XREF file 651 and subsequently the record pointed to in the INFO file 640. Upon selection of a particular part 600, part selection device 106 accesses all of the needed bearing information stored in data storage device 104 to select a particular part. Subsequently, the part selection device 106 ends the procedure get part by OEM part number for bearing 602.</p>
    <p>Alternatively a user may choose a bearing by part number to OEM part number. FIG. 21 is a flow chart diagramming a procedure for selecting a bearing by a part number and FIG. 23 shows a preferred embodiment file structure containing bearing information stored in data storage device 104 for use in selecting a bearing by part number. Upon selecting the choice of specifying a bearing by part number 604, a user is prompted to enter a part number 606.</p>
    <p>Subsequently, part selection device 106 will check if the part number is valid 608. The validity checking is accomplished by finding an HPTR record in the HPTR file 637 which is substantially similar to the part number entered. The HPTR file 637 comprises HPTR records sorted in part number order. Each HPTR record comprises a pointer to a record within an HTAB file 636 comprising a part number. If the part number is not valid, part selection device 106 will prompt the user to enter a part number 606 once again.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, if the part number is valid then part selection device 106 will display manufacturers of the part number 610 and prompt the user to select a manufacturer cf the part number. The list manufacturers displayed is derived from data storage device 104 by accessing the same record number in the DPTR file 641 as was found to be a valid part number in the validity checking. The DPTR file 641 comprises the same number of records as the HPTR file 637 sorted in the same order by part number. Each DPTR record includes a pointer 640 to a manufacturer in a MFG.. file 644 and a pointer 642 to either a CHAIN1 file 646 when the selected part number is an OEM part number or to an XREF file 651 when the selected part number is not an OEM part number. The XREF file 651 is a file sorted by part number comprising records including a pointer 650 into a record within DPTR file 641, a pointer into INFO file 652, a pointer 654 to CHAIN2 file 662 and the price 656 of the part. The CHAIN2 file 662 comprises records including one or more pointers to records within XREF file 651. Another file known as DOUBLE CROSS file 659 is included in the data storage device 104. DOUBLE CROSS file 659 is a file with the same number of records as XREF file 651 sorted by part number comprising records including a pointer 660 into a record within CHAIN3 file 658.</p>
    <p>For example, a list of manufacturers is derived by taking HPTR record number (e.g. the record including pointer 638) of the valid part number and using it to access the same record number in the DPTR file 641. The record number in the DPTR file 641 corresponding to the same record number comprises a pointer (e.g. pointer 642) to a record in the XREF file 651. This XREF record corresponds to a record in the DOUBLE CROSS file 659 which includes a pointer 660 to CHAIN3 file 658. The record pointed to in CHAIN3 file 658 includes one or more pointers back into DPTR file 641 each of which subsequently include a pointer (e.g. pointer 640) to a record in the MFGR file 644 comprising an OEM manufacturer of that part number. The process of looking up more records in the MFGR file 644 continues until the last pointer in the pointed at record in the CHAIN3 file 658 does not contain a pointer back into the DPTR file 641. At this point the part selection device 106 knows all of the OEM manufacturers of the part number entered.</p>
    <p>Upon selection of a manufacturer 612, the part selection device 106 queries the user whether or not the user wants to enter another parts number 614. If the user wants to enter another parts number, the part selection device 106 will prompt the user to enter a part number 606. Otherwise, the part selection device 106 ends the procedure get part by part number to OEM part number for bearing 616.</p>
    <p>Alternatively a user may choose a bearing by a partial OEM part number. FIG. 22 is a flow chart diagramming a procedure for selecting a bearing by a partial OEM part number and FIG. 23 shows a preferred embodiment file structure containing filter information stored in data storage device 104 for use in selecting a bearing by OEM part number. Upon selecting the choice of specifying a bearing by OEM part number 618, a user is prompted to enter a part number 620.</p>
    <p>Subsequently, part selection device 106 will check if the part number is valid 622. The validity checking is accomplished by finding an HPTR record in the HPTR file 637 which is substantially similar to the part number entered. The HPTR file 637 comprises HPTR records sorted in part number order. Each HPTR record comprises a pointer to a record within an HTAB file 636 comprising a part number. If the part number is not valid, part selection device will prompt the user to enter a part number 620 once again.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, if the part number is valid then part selection device 106 will display manufacturers of the part number 624 and prompt the user to select a manufacturer of the part number. The list manufacturers displayed is derived from data storage device 104 by accessing the same record number in the DPTR file 641 as was found to be a valid part number in the validity checking. The DPTR file 641 comprises the same number of records as the HPTR file 637 sorted in the same order by part number. Each DPTR record includes a pointer 640 to a manufacturer in a MFGR file 644 and a pointer 642 to either a CHAIN1 file 646 when the selected part number is an OEM part number or to an XREF file 651 when the selected part number is not an OEM part number. The XREF file 651 is a file sorted by part number comprising records including a pointer 650 into a record within DPTR file 641, a pointer into INFO file 652, a pointer 654 to CHAIN2 file 662 and the price 656 of the part. The CHAIN2 file 662 comprises records including one or more pointers to records within XREF file 651.</p>
    <p>For example, a list of manufacturers is derived by taking HPTR record number (e.g. the record including pointer 638) of the valid part number and using it to access the same record number in the DPTR file 641. The record number in the DPTR file 641 corresponding to the same record number comprises a pointer (e.g. pointer 640) to a manufacturer of that part number. The manufacturer is retrieved by accessing the data in the record in the MFGR file 644 pointed to by the pointer (e.g. pointer 640). The DPTR file 641 record also includes a pointer (e.g. pointer 642) to a record in the CHAIN1 file 646. This CHAIN1 file 646 may include one or more pointers to records in the XREF file 651. Each of these records pointed at may include pointers 650 which point back into the DPTR file 641 which includes a pointer (e.g. pointer 640) to a particular record in the MFGR file 644 comprising another manufacturer of that part. The process of looking up more records in the MFGR file 644 comprises searching records sequentially in the sorted DPTR file 641 until the HPTR file 637 record corresponding to the DPTR file 641 record being considered for inclusion in the list of manufacturers is not related to the selected part number. At this point the part selection device 106 knows all of the manufacturers of the part number entered.</p>
    <p>Upon selection of a manufacturer 626, the part selection device 106 queries the user whether or not the user wants to enter another parts number 628. If the user wants to enter another parts number, the part selection device 106 will prompt the user to enter a part number 620. Otherwise, part selection means 106 displays the particular part information 630 and selects a particular part. The part information is derived from the data storage device 104 by accessing information pointed to by the records of the DPTR file 641 associated with the part number entered. The specific part information is accessed from the records pointed to in the XREF file 651 and subsequently the record pointed to in the INFO file 640. Upon selection of a particular part 632, part selection device 106 accesses all of the needed bearing information stored in data storage device 104 to select a particular part. Subsequently, the part selection device 106 ends the procedure get part by partial OEM part number for bearing 634.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 24A, 24B, 24C, 24D, 24E, and 24F, these figures encompass a flow chart of an example showing the use of the preferred part selection device 106 and display apparatus 102 in a parts selection computer system 100. The flow chart diagrams an example of using computer system 100 from a user's point of view by depicting graphic and textual parts-related information which may be shown to a user. This information preferably is shown to a user on a video display screen for review or for continued navigation through a series of menus.</p>
    <p>Referring now more particularly to FIG. 24a, by starting at the introduction menu/screen display 700 a user is given the choice to select from a plurality of options including an option to go to a cross-reference menu/screen display 702 and a product information menu/screen display 730. Upon selecting to go to cross-reference 702, a screen such as the one shown in FIG. 26 is presented on the display. At this point the user may choose to look up various parts, e.g., batteries, filters, remanufactured electrical parts, lubrication and bearings. For this example we will focus on batteries; however, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the cross-reference scheme shown here by example for batteries can be substantially duplicated for virtually any part benefiting from the present system.</p>
    <p>Upon choosing batteries from the options in FIG. 26, a menu/screen display 706 shown in FIG. 27 is presented to the user. At this point the user may choose to find a particular part by part number, equipment application or battery specifications. In choosing a part by part number, a particular part is automatically found in data storage device 104 and selected for the user. However, if a user chooses to find a part by equipment application, a menu/display screen 708 as shown in FIG. 28 is presented to the user. At this point the user may choose to add a unit to the list of equipment for this particular proposal or order. Upon choosing to add the equipment, a pop-up menu of equipment application section menu/screen display 710 as depicted in FIG. 29 is shown to the user. The user may select any one of the five types of equipment to find a part for. In this example, we will choose to select passenger cars; however, it will be appreciate by those familiar with the art that the other types of equipment will have similar types of menu selections in order to find a particular part for a particular product or piece of equipment.</p>
    <p>Upon selecting passenger cars, a menu/screen display 712 as shown in FIG. 30 is shown to the user. The menu shows particular manufacturers of passenger cars to choose from to find a particular part for. As indicated in FIG. 30, subsequent screens showing other manufacturers of passenger cars are available for viewing. In the preferred embodiment, the menu display screen shown is the first of a set of seven possible menu/display screens which may be shown on the display screen. For simplicity we will select for this example the Audi manufacturer.</p>
    <p>Upon choosing the Audi manufacturer, a menu/screen display 714 is shown to the user so that he or she may select a particular set of years in which to look for a part for that particular manufacturer of passenger cars. For this example, we will choose the model years 1970 to 1977. Upon choosing model years 1970 to 1977, a menu/screen display 716 shown in FIG. 32 is shown to the user. On this screen display the user is given the choice to select a particular engine type which, in this case, include 80, all others or optional engine types. For simplicity, we will choose an 80 engine for this example. Upon selection of the 80 engine, the user is presented a menu/screen display 718 shown in FIG. 33 which gives a brief summary of the selections made in choosing this particular piece of equipment. If the user is satisfied with this selection, he or she may return to menu/screen display 706 shown in FIG. 27. Otherwise, the user may choose to edit the particular equipment selected or add another unit.</p>
    <p>Upon returning to menu/screen display 706 shown in FIG. 27, the user may choose to order the part at this point. If the user chooses to order the part, he or she is shown a screen similar to one as depicted in menu/screen display 720 shown in FIG. 34. The menu/screen display 720 shown in FIG. 34 is related to the selections previously made in this example, and it will be appreciated by those familiar with the art that the menu/screen display will change depending upon the particular piece of equipment selected. The user may choose to display the price of the particular part 721 at this time.</p>
    <p>If the user is satisfied with the parts that have been selected, he or she may choose to generate a report showing this proposal/order of parts. Upon selecting a reporting option, a menu/screen display 722 shown in FIG. 35 may be shown to the user. The user may choose to generate several types of reports. In this example, we will choose to generate a proposal/order. Upon choosing a proposal/order report selection, a menu/screen display 724 shown in FIG. 36 is shown to the user. At this point, the user may choose to generate a detailed or a summary report type.</p>
    <p>Upon choosing a detailed report type, a report similar to one shown in screen display 726 and depicted in FIG. 37 is generated. Alternatively, the user may choose to generate a summary report type. Upon choosing the summary report type, a proposal/order would be generated similar to one shown in screen display 728 as depicted in FIG. 38.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, a user may choose to pick a particular battery by setting particular battery specifications, as shown in FIG. 24C. For example, a user may choose to specify a BCI group as shown in menu/screen display 746 and depicted in FIG. 39. Alternatively, a user may choose to specify a particular battery by cold cranking amps as depicted in menu/screen display 747 as shown in FIG. 40.

Alternatively, a user may choose to select a particular battery by price as shown in menu/screen display 756 and depicted in FIG. 45.</p>
    <p>It is also possible for a user to-pick one or more of the battery specifications to further specify a particular battery for selection. Typically, it is necessary to pick more than one particular specification in order to limit the possible part choices down to a small number of batteries to choose from. Furthermore, in practice, a user will know several of the specifications for his or her particular need and, as such, selecting a particular battery through battery specifications may be very useful. After selecting a particular battery by any one of the three possible selection schemes including by part number, by equipment application and by battery specifications, a user can choose to generate a report or continue and pick another part, e.g., a filter, remanufactured electrical part, lubrication or bearings or perhaps may choose to select yet another battery for an order. As previously indicated, those skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention can be substantially duplicated for virtually any part benefiting from the present system.</p>
