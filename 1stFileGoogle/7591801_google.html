Manual integrations provide for a physical association between the devices wherein a user (for example, patient or doctor) manually selects the amount, type, and/or time of delivery. Semi-automated integration of the devices includes integrations wherein an operable connection between the integrated components aids the user (for example, patient or doctor) in selecting, inputting, calculating, or validating the amount, type, or time of medicament delivery of glucose values, for example, by transmitting data to another component and thereby reducing the amount of user input required. Automated integration between the devices includes integrations wherein an operable connection between the integrated components provides for full control of the system without required user

Manual integrations provide for a physical association between the devices wherein a user (for example, patient or doctor) manually selects the amount, type, and/or time of delivery. Semi-automated integration of the devices includes integrations wherein an operable connection between the integrated components aids the user (for example, patient or doctor) in selecting, inputting, calculating, or validating the amount, type, or time of medicament delivery of glucose values, for example, by transmitting data to another component and thereby reducing the amount of user input required.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0002">The present invention relates generally to systems and methods monitoring glucose in a host. More particularly, the present invention relates to an integrated medicament delivery device and continuous glucose sensor.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the pancreas cannot create sufficient insulin (Type I or insulin dependent) and/or in which insulin is not effective (Type 2 or non-insulin dependent). In the diabetic state, the victim suffers from high blood sugar, which may cause an array of physiological derangements (for example, kidney failure, skin ulcers, or bleeding into the vitreous of the eye) associated with the deterioration of small blood vessels. A hypoglycemic reaction (low blood sugar) may be induced by an inadvertent overdose of insulin, or after a normal dose of insulin or glucose-lowering agent accompanied by extraordinary exercise or insufficient food intake.</p>
    <p num="p-0004">Conventionally, a diabetic person carries a self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) monitor, which typically comprises uncomfortable finger pricking methods. Due to the lack of comfort and convenience, a diabetic will normally only measure his or her glucose level two to four times per day. Unfortunately, these time intervals are so far spread apart that the diabetic will likely find out too late, sometimes incurring dangerous side effects, of a hyper- or hypo-glycemic condition. In fact, it is not only unlikely that a diabetic will take a timely SMBG value, but the diabetic will not know if their blood glucose value is going up (higher) or down (lower) based on conventional methods, inhibiting their ability to make educated insulin therapy decisions.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">Home diabetes therapy requires personal discipline of the user, appropriate education from a doctor, proactive behavior under sometimes-adverse situations, patient calculations to determine appropriate therapy decisions, including types and amounts of administration of insulin and glucose into his or her system, and is subject to human error. Technologies are needed that ease the burdens faced by diabetic patients, simplify the processes involved in treating the disease, and minimize user error which may cause unnecessarily dangerous situations in some circumstances.</p>

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading> <p num="p-0053">The following description and examples illustrate some exemplary embodiments of the disclosed invention in detail. Those of skill in the art will recognize that there are numerous variations and modifications of this invention that are encompassed by its scope. Accordingly, the description of a certain exemplary embodiment should not be deemed to limit the scope of the present invention.</p>
    <heading>DEFINITIONS</heading> <p num="p-0054">In order to facilitate an understanding of the disclosed invention, a number of terms are defined below.</p>
    <p num="p-0055">The term “continuous glucose sensor,” as used herein, is a broad term and are used in its ordinary sense, including, but not limited to, a device that continuously or continually measures glucose concentration, for example, at time intervals ranging from fractions of a second up to, for example, 1, 2, or 5 minutes, or longer. It should be understood that continual or continuous glucose sensors can continually measure glucose concentration without requiring user initiation and/or interaction for each measurement, such as described with reference to U.S. Pat. No. 6,001,067, for example.</p>
    <p num="p-0056">The phrase “continuous glucose sensing,” as used herein, is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, but not limited to, the period in which monitoring of plasma glucose concentration is continuously or continually performed, for example, at time intervals ranging from fractions of a second up to, for example, 1, 2, or 5 minutes, or longer.</p>
    <p num="p-0057">The term “biological sample,” as used herein, is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, but not limited to, sample of a host body, for example, blood, interstitial fluid, spinal fluid, saliva, urine, tears, sweat, or the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0058">The term “host,” as used herein, is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, but not limited to, mammals such as humans.</p>
    <p num="p-0059">The term “biointerface membrane,” as used herein, is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, without limitation, a permeable or semi-permeable membrane that can include two or more domains and is typically constructed of materials of a few microns thickness or more, which can be placed over the sensing region to keep host cells (for example, macrophages) from gaining proximity to, and thereby damaging the sensing membrane or forming a barrier cell layer and interfering with the transport of glucose across the tissue-device interface.</p>
    <p num="p-0060">The term “sensing membrane,” as used herein, is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, without limitation, a permeable or semi-permeable membrane that can be comprised of two or more domains and is typically constructed of materials of a few microns thickness or more, which are permeable to oxygen and are optionally permeable to glucose. In one example, the sensing membrane comprises an immobilized glucose oxidase enzyme, which enables an electrochemical reaction to occur to measure a concentration of glucose.</p>
    <p num="p-0061">The term “domain,” as used herein is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, without limitation, regions of a membrane that can be layers, uniform or non-uniform gradients (for example, anisotropic), functional aspects of a material, or provided as portions of the membrane.</p>
    <p num="p-0062">As used herein, the term “copolymer,” as used herein, is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, without limitation, polymers having two or more different repeat units and includes copolymers, terpolymers, tetrapolymers, etc.</p>
    <p num="p-0063">The term “sensing region,” as used herein, is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, without limitation, the region of a monitoring device responsible for the detection of a particular glucose. In one embodiment, the sensing region generally comprises a non-conductive body, a working electrode (anode), a reference electrode and a counter electrode (cathode) passing through and secured within the body forming an electrochemically reactive surface at one location on the body and an electronic connection at another location on the body, and a sensing membrane affixed to the body and covering the electrochemically reactive surface. The counter electrode typically has a greater electrochemically reactive surface area than the working electrode. During general operation of the sensor a biological sample (for example, blood or interstitial fluid) or a portion thereof contacts (for example, directly or after passage through one or more domains of the sensing membrane) an enzyme (for example, glucose oxidase); the reaction of the biological sample (or portion thereof) results in the formation of reaction products that allow a determination of the glucose level in the biological sample.</p>
    <p num="p-0064">The term “electrochemically reactive surface,” as used herein, is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, without limitation, the surface of an electrode where an electrochemical reaction takes place. In the case of the working electrode, the hydrogen peroxide produced by the enzyme catalyzed reaction of the glucose being detected reacts creating a measurable electronic current (for example, detection of glucose utilizing glucose oxidase produces H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>as a by product, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>reacts with the surface of the working electrode producing two protons (2H<sup>+</sup>), two electrons (2e<sup>−</sup>) and one molecule of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) which produces the electronic current being detected). In the case of the counter electrode, a reducible species (for example, O<sub>2</sub>) is reduced at the electrode surface in order to balance the current being generated by the working electrode.</p>
    <p num="p-0065">The term “electrochemical cell,” as used herein, is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, without limitation, a device in which chemical energy is converted to electrical energy. Such a cell typically consists of two or more electrodes held apart from each other and in contact with an electrolyte solution. Connection of the electrodes to a source of direct electric current renders one of them negatively charged and the other positively charged. Positive ions in the electrolyte migrate to the negative electrode (cathode) and there combine with one or more electrons, losing part or all of their charge and becoming new ions having lower charge or neutral atoms or molecules; at the same time, negative ions migrate to the positive electrode (anode) and transfer one or more electrons to it, also becoming new ions or neutral particles. The overall effect of the two processes is the transfer of electrons from the negative ions to the positive ions, a chemical reaction.</p>
    <p num="p-0066">The term “proximal” as used herein, is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, without limitation, near to a point of reference such as an origin or a point of attachment. For example, in some embodiments of a sensing membrane that covers an electrochemically reactive surface, the electrolyte domain is located more proximal to the electrochemically reactive surface than the interference domain.</p>
    <p num="p-0067">The term “distal” as used herein, is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, without limitation, spaced relatively far from a point of reference, such as an origin or a point of attachment. For example, in some embodiments of a sensing membrane that covers an electrochemically reactive surface, a resistance domain is located more distal to the electrochemically reactive surfaces than the enzyme domain.</p>
    <p num="p-0068">The term “substantially” as used herein, is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, without limitation, being largely but not necessarily wholly that which is specified.</p>
    <p num="p-0069">The term “microprocessor,” as used herein, is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, without limitation, a computer system or processor designed to perform arithmetic and logic operations using logic circuitry that responds to and processes the basic instructions that drive a computer.</p>
    <p num="p-0070">The term “ROM,” as used herein, is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, but not limited to, read-only memory, which is a type of data storage device manufactured with fixed contents. ROM is broad enough to include EEPROM, for example, which is electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (ROM).</p>
    <p num="p-0071">The term “RAM,” as used herein, is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, but not limited to, a data storage device for which the order of access to different locations does not affect the speed of access. RAM is broad enough to include SRAM, for example, which is static random access memory that retains data bits in its memory as long as power is being supplied.</p>
    <p num="p-0072">The term “A/D Converter,” as used herein, is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, but not limited to, hardware and/or software that converts analog electrical signals into corresponding digital signals.</p>
    <p num="p-0073">The term “RF transceiver,” as used herein, is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, but not limited to, a radio frequency transmitter and/or receiver for transmitting and/or receiving signals.</p>
    <p num="p-0074">The terms “raw data stream” and “data stream,” as used herein, are broad terms and are used in their ordinary sense, including, but not limited to, an analog or digital signal directly related to the analyte concentration measured by the analyte sensor. In one example, the raw data stream is digital data in “counts” converted by an A/D converter from an analog signal (for example, voltage or amps) representative of an analyte concentration. The terms broadly encompass a plurality of time spaced data points from a substantially continuous analyte sensor, which comprises individual measurements taken at time intervals ranging from fractions of a second up to, for example, 1, 2, or 5 minutes or longer.</p>
    <p num="p-0075">The term “counts,” as used herein, is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, but not limited to, a unit of measurement of a digital signal. In one example, a raw data stream measured in counts is directly related to a voltage (for example, converted by an A/D converter), which is directly related to current from a working electrode.</p>
    <p num="p-0076">The term “electronic circuitry,” as used herein, is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, but not limited to, the components (for example, hardware and/or software) of a device configured to process data. In the case of an analyte sensor, the data includes biological information obtained by a sensor regarding the concentration of the analyte in a biological fluid. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,757,022, 5,497,772 and 4,787,398, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety, describe suitable electronic circuits that can be utilized with devices of certain embodiments.</p>
    <p num="p-0077">The term “potentiostat,” as used herein, is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, but not limited to, an electrical system that controls the potential between the working and reference electrodes of a three-electrode cell at a preset value. The potentiostat forces whatever current is necessary to flow between the working and counter electrodes to keep the desired potential, as long as the needed cell voltage and current do not exceed the compliance limits of the potentiostat.</p>
    <p num="p-0078">The terms “operably connected” and “operably linked,” as used herein, are broad terms and are used in their ordinary sense, including, but not limited to, one or more components being linked to another component(s) in a manner that allows transmission of signals between the components. For example, one or more electrodes can be used to detect the amount of glucose in a sample and convert that information into a signal; the signal can then be transmitted to an electronic circuit. In this case, the electrode is “operably linked” to the electronic circuit. These terms are broad enough to include wired and wireless connectivity.</p>
    <p num="p-0079">The term “algorithmically smoothed,” as used herein, is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, but not limited to, modification of a set of data to make it smoother and more continuous and remove or diminish outlying points, for example, by performing a moving average of the raw data stream.</p>
    <p num="p-0080">The term “algorithm,” as used herein, is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, but not limited to, the computational processes (for example, programs) involved in transforming information from one state to another, for example using computer processing.</p>
    <p num="p-0081">The term “regression,” as used herein, is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, but not limited to, finding a line in which a set of data has a minimal measurement (for example, deviation) from that line. Regression can be linear, non-linear, first order, second order, and so forth. One example of regression is least squares regression.</p>
    <p num="p-0082">The terms “recursive filter” and “auto-regressive algorithm,” as used herein, are broad terms and are used in their ordinary sense, including, but not limited to, an equation in which previous averages are part of the next filtered output. More particularly, the generation of a series of observations whereby the value of each observation is partly dependent on the values of those that have immediately preceded it. One example is a regression structure in which lagged response values assume the role of the independent variables.</p>
    <p num="p-0083">The terms “velocity” and “rate of change,” as used herein, are broad terms and are used in their ordinary sense, including, but not limited to, time rate of change; the amount of change divided by the time required for the change. In one embodiment, these terms refer to the rate of increase or decrease in an analyte for a certain time period.</p>
    <p num="p-0084">The term “acceleration” as used herein, is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, but not limited to, the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. This term is broad enough to include deceleration.</p>
    <p num="p-0085">The term “clinical risk,” as used herein, is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, but not limited to, an identified danger or potential risk to the health of a patient based on a measured or estimated analyte concentration, its rate of change, and/or its acceleration.</p>

    <p num="p-0087">The term “time period,” as used herein, is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, but not limited to, an amount of time including a single point in time and a path (for example, range of time) that extends from a first point in time to a second point in time.</p>
    <p num="p-0088">The term “measured analyte values,” as used herein, is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense, including, but not limited to, an analyte value or set of analyte values for a time period for which analyte data has been measured by an analyte sensor.

    <p num="h-0007">Overview</p>
    <p num="p-0092"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of an integrated system <b>10</b> of the preferred embodiments, including a continuous glucose sensor <b>12</b>, a receiver <b>14</b> for processing and displaying sensor data, a medicament delivery device <b>16</b>, and optionally a single point glucose-monitoring device <b>18</b>. The integrated diabetes management system <b>10</b> of the preferred embodiments provides improved convenience and accuracy thus affording a diabetic patient <b>8</b> with improved convenience, functionality, and safety in the care of their disease.</p>
    <p num="p-0093"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a continuous glucose sensor <b>12</b> that measures a concentration of glucose or a substance indicative of the concentration or presence of the glucose. In some embodiments, the glucose sensor <b>12</b> is an invasive, minimally invasive, or non-invasive device, for example a subcutaneous, transdermal, or intravascular device. In some embodiments, the sensor <b>12</b> may analyze a plurality of intermittent biological samples. The glucose sensor may use any method of glucose-measurement, including enzymatic, chemical, physical, electrochemical, spectrophotometric, polarimetric, calorimetric, radiometric, or the like. In alternative embodiments, the sensor <b>12</b> may be any sensor capable of determining the level of an analyte in the body, for example oxygen, lactase, insulin, hormones, cholesterol, medicaments, viruses, or the like. The glucose sensor <b>12</b> uses any known method to provide an output signal indicative of the concentration of the glucose. The output signal is typically a raw data stream that is used to provide a useful value of the measured glucose concentration to a patient or doctor, for example.</p>
    <p num="p-0094">Accordingly, a receiver <b>14</b> is provided that receives and processes the raw data stream, including calibrating, validating, and displaying meaningful glucose values to a patient, such as described in more detail below. A medicament delivery device <b>16</b> is further provided as a part of the integrated system <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, the medicament delivery device <b>16</b> is a manual delivery device, for example a syringe, inhaler, or transdermal patch, which is manually integrated with the receiver <b>14</b>. In some embodiments, the medicament delivery device <b>16</b> is a semi-automated delivery device, for example a pen or jet-type injector, an inhaler, a spray, or pump, which provides a semi-automated integration with the receiver <b>14</b>. In some embodiments, the medicament delivery device <b>16</b> is an automated delivery device, for example a transcutaneous or implantable pump system, which provides an automated integration with the receiver <b>14</b>. In some embodiments, an optional single point glucose monitor <b>18</b> is further provided as a part of the integrated system <b>10</b>, for example a self-monitoring blood glucose meter (SMBG), non-invasive glucose meter, or the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0095">Conventionally, each of these devices separately provides valuable information and or services to diabetic patients. Thus, a typical diabetic patient has numerous individual devices, which they track and consider separately. In some cases, the amount of information provided by these individual devices may require complex understanding of the nuances and implications of each device, for example types and amounts of insulin to deliver. Typically, each individual device is a silo of information that functions as well as the data provided therein, therefore when the devices are able to communicate with each other, enhanced functionality and safety may be realized. For example, when a continuous glucose monitor functions alone (for example, without data other than that which was gathered by the device), sudden changes in glucose level are tracked, but may not be fully understood, predicted, preempted, or otherwise considered in the processing of the sensor data; however, if the continuous glucose sensor were provided with information about time, amount, and type of insulin injections, calories consumed, time or day, meal time, or like, more meaningful, accurate and useful glucose estimation, prediction, and other such processing can be provided, such as described in more detail herein. By integrating these devices, the information from each component can be leveraged to increase the intelligence, benefit provided, convenience, safety, and functionality of the continuous glucose sensor and other integrated components. Therefore, it would be advantageous to provide a device that aids the diabetic patient in integrating these individual devices in the treatment of his/her disease.</p>
    <p num="h-0008">Glucose Sensor</p>
    <p num="p-0096"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view of one embodiment of a continuous glucose sensor <b>12</b>. In this embodiment, a body <b>20</b> and a sensing region <b>22</b> house the electrodes and sensor electronics (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The three electrodes within the sensing region are operably connected to the sensor electronics (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and are covered by a sensing membrane and a biointerface membrane (not shown), which are described in more detail below.</p>
    <p num="p-0097">The body <b>20</b> is preferably formed from epoxy molded around the sensor electronics, however the body may be formed from a variety of materials, including metals, ceramics, plastics, or composites thereof. Co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/646,333, entitled, “Optimized Sensor Geometry for an Implantable Glucose Sensor” discloses suitable configurations suitable for the body <b>20</b>, and is incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
    <p num="p-0098">In one embodiment, the sensing region <b>22</b> comprises three electrodes including a platinum working electrode, a platinum counter electrode, and a silver/silver chloride reference electrode, for example. However a variety of electrode materials and configurations may be used with the implantable glucose sensor of the preferred embodiments. The top ends of the electrodes are in contact with an electrolyte phase (not shown), which is a free-flowing fluid phase disposed between the sensing membrane and the electrodes. In one embodiment, the counter electrode is provided to balance the current generated by the species being measured at the working electrode. In the case of a glucose oxidase based glucose sensor, the species being measured at the working electrode is H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Glucose oxidase catalyzes the conversion of oxygen and glucose to hydrogen peroxide and gluconate according to the following reaction:
<br>Glucose+O<sub>2</sub>→Gluconate+H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub> </p>
    <p num="p-0099">The change in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>can be monitored to determine glucose concentration because for each glucose molecule metabolized, there is a proportional change in the product H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Oxidation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>by the working electrode is balanced by reduction of ambient oxygen, enzyme generated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, or other reducible species at the counter electrode. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>produced from the glucose oxidase reaction further reacts at the surface of working electrode and produces two protons (2H<sup>+</sup>), two electrons (2e<sup>−</sup>), and one oxygen molecule (O<sub>2</sub>).</p>
    <p num="p-0100">In one embodiment, a potentiostat (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is employed to monitor the electrochemical reaction at the electroactive surface(s). The potentiostat applies a constant potential to the working and reference electrodes to determine a current value. The current that is produced at the working electrode (and flows through the circuitry to the counter electrode) is substantially proportional to the amount of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>that diffuses to the working electrode. Accordingly, a raw signal can be produced that is representative of the concentration of glucose in the user's body, and therefore can be utilized to estimate a meaningful glucose value.</p>
    <p num="p-0101">In some embodiments, the sensing membrane includes an enzyme, for example, glucose oxidase, and covers the electrolyte phase. In one embodiment, the sensing membrane generally includes a resistance domain most distal from the electrochemically reactive surfaces, an enzyme domain less distal from the electrochemically reactive surfaces than the resistance domain, and an electrolyte domain adjacent to the electrochemically reactive surfaces. However, it is understood that a sensing membrane modified for other devices, for example, by including fewer or additional domains, is within the scope of the preferred embodiments. Co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/916,711, entitled, “SENSOR HEAD FOR USE WITH IMPLANTABLE DEVICES,” which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes membranes that can be used in some embodiments of the sensing membrane. It is noted that in some embodiments, the sensing membrane may additionally include an interference domain that blocks some interfering species; such as described in the above-cited co-pending patent application. Co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/695,636, entitled, “SILICONE COMPOSITION FOR BIOCOMPATIBLE MEMBRANE” also describes membranes that may be used for the sensing membrane of the preferred embodiments, and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
    <p num="p-0102">Preferably, the biointerface membrane supports tissue ingrowth, serves to interfere with the formation of a barrier cell layer, and protects the sensitive regions of the device from host inflammatory response. In one embodiment, the biointerface membrane generally includes a cell disruptive domain most distal from the electrochemically reactive surfaces and a cell impermeable domain less distal from the electrochemically reactive surfaces than the cell disruptive domain. The cell disruptive domain is preferably designed to support tissue ingrowth, disrupt contractile forces typically found in a foreign body response, encourage vascularity within the membrane, and disrupt the formation of a barrier cell layer. The cell impermeable domain is preferably resistant to cellular attachment, impermeable to cells, and composed of a biostable material. Copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/916,386, entitled, “MEMBRANE FOR USE WITH IMPLANTABLE DEVICES,” U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/647,065, entitled, “POROUS MEMBRANES FOR USE WITH IMPLANTABLE DEVICES,” and U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60/544,722, filed Feb. 12, 2004 entitled, “BIOINTERFACE WITH INTEGRATED MACRO- AND MICRO-ARCHITECTURE,” describe biointerface membranes that may be used in conjunction with the preferred embodiments, and are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. It is noted that the preferred embodiments may be used with a short term (for example, 1 to 7 day sensor), in which case a biointerface membrane may not be required. It is noted that the biointerface membranes described herein provide a continuous glucose sensor that has a useable life of greater than about one week, greater than about one month, greater than about three months, or greater than about one year, herein after referred to as “long-term.”</p>

    <p num="h-0010">Medicament Delivery Device</p>
    <p num="p-0112">The preferred embodiments provide an integrated system <b>10</b>, which includes a medicament delivery device <b>16</b> for administering a medicament to the patient <b>8</b>. The integrated medicament delivery device can be designed for bolus injection, continuous injection, inhalation, transdermal absorption, other method for administering medicament, or any combinations thereof. The term medicament includes any substance used in therapy for a patient using the system <b>10</b>, for example, insulin, glucacon, or derivatives thereof. Published International Application WO 02/43566 describes glucose, glucagon, and vitamins A, C, or D that may be used with the preferred embodiments. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,051,551 and 6,024,090 describe types of insulin suitable for inhalation that may be used with the preferred embodiments. U.S. Pat. No. 5,234,906, U.S. Pat.

All of the above references are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety and may be useful as the medicament(s) in the preferred embodiments.</p>
    <p num="h-0011">Manual Integration</p>
    <p num="p-0113">In some embodiments, the medicament delivery device <b>16</b> is a manual delivery device, for example a syringe, inhaler, transdermal patch, cell transplantation device, and/or manual pump for manual integration with the receiver. Manual integration includes medicament delivery devices wherein a user (for example, patient or doctor) manually selects the amount, type, and/or time of delivery. In some embodiments, the medicament delivery device <b>16</b> is any syringe suitable for injecting a medicament, as is appreciated by one skilled in the art. One example of a syringe suitable for the medicament delivery device of the preferred embodiments is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,137,511, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
    <p num="p-0114"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> are perspective views of a integrated system <b>10</b> in one embodiment, wherein a receiver <b>14</b> is integrated with a medicament delivery device <b>16</b> in the form of a manual syringe <b>54</b>, and optionally includes a single point glucose monitor <b>18</b>, which will be described in more detail elsewhere herein. The receiver <b>14</b> receives, processes, and displays data from the continuous glucose monitor <b>12</b>, such as described in more detail above, and may also receive, process, and display data manually entered by the user. In some embodiments, the receiver includes algorithms that use parameters provided by the continuous glucose sensor, such as glucose concentration, rate-of-change of the glucose concentration, and acceleration of the glucose concentration to more particularly determine the type, amount, and time of medicament administration. The medicament delivery device <b>16</b> is in the form of a syringe <b>54</b>, which may comprise any known syringe configuration, such as described in more detail above. In some embodiments, the syringe <b>54</b> includes a housing, which is designed to hold a syringe as well as a plurality of types and amounts of medicament, for example fast-acting insulin, slow-acting insulin, and glucagon. In some embodiments, the syringe is detachably connectable to the receiver <b>14</b>, and the receiver <b>14</b> provides and receives information to and from the patient associated with the time, type, and amount of medicament administered. In some embodiments, the syringe is stored in a holder that is integral with or detachably connected to the receiver <b>14</b>. In some embodiments, the syringe <b>54</b> may be detachable connected directly to the receiver, provided in a kit with the receiver, or other configuration, which provides easy association between the syringe and the receiver.</p>
    <p num="p-0115">Referring now to the integration between the syringe and the receiver, it is noted that the receiver can be programmed with information about the time, amount, and types of medicament that may be administered with the syringe, for example. In some embodiments during set-up of the system, the patient and/or doctor manually enters information about the amounts and types of medicament available via the syringe of the integrated system. In some alternative embodiments, manufacturer-provided data can be downloaded to the receiver so that the patient and/or doctor can select appropriate information from menus on the screen, for example, to provide easy and accurate data entry. Thus, by knowing the available medicaments, the receiver may be programmed to customize the patient's therapy recommendations considering available types and amounts of medicaments in combination with concentration, rate-of-change, and/or acceleration of the patient's glucose. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that by storing available medicament therapies, the receiver is able to customize medicament calculations and recommend appropriate therapy based glucose on trend information and the preferred types and the amounts of medicament available to the patient.</p>
    <p num="p-0116">Subsequently in some embodiments, once the patient has administered a medicament (including via the syringe and or by other means), the amount, type, and/or time of medicament administration are input into the receiver by the patient. Similarly, the receiver may be programmed with standard medicaments and dosages for easy selection by the patient (for example, menus on the user interface). This information can be used by the receiver to increase the intelligence of the algorithms used in determining the glucose trends and patterns that may be useful in predicting and analyzing present, past, and future glucose trends, and in providing therapy recommendations, which will be described in more detail below. Additionally, by continuously monitoring the glucose concentration over time, the receiver provides valuable information about how a patient responds to a particular medicament, which information may be used by a doctor, patient, or by the algorithms within the receiver, to determine patterns and provide more personalized therapy recommendations. In other words, in some embodiments, the receiver includes programming that learns the patterns (for example, an individual's metabolic response to certain medicament deliveries and patient behavior) and to determine an optimum time, amount, and type of medicament to delivery in a variety of conditions (e.g., glucose concentration, rate-of-change, and acceleration). While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that by continuously monitoring an individual's response to various medicaments, the patient's glucose levels can be more proactively treated, keeping the diabetic patient within safe glucose ranges substantially all the time.</p>
    <p num="p-0117">In some embodiments, the receiver includes programming to predict glucose trends, such as described in co-pending U.S. provisional patent application 60/528,382, entitled, “SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR CONTINUOUS ANALYTE SENSORS”, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In some embodiments, the predictive algorithms consider the amount, type, and time of medicament delivery in predicting glucose values. For example, a predictive algorithm that predicts a glucose value or trend for the upcoming 15 to 20 minutes uses a mathematical algorithm (for example, regression, smoothing, or the like) such as described in the above-cited provisional patent application 60/528,382 to project a glucose value. However outside influences, including medicament delivery may cause this projection to be inaccurate. Therefore, some embodiments provide programming in the receiver that uses the medicament delivery information received from the delivery device <b>14</b>, in addition to other mathematical equations, to more accurately predict glucose values in the future.</p>
    <p num="p-0118">In some alternative embodiments, the medicament delivery device <b>16</b> includes one or more transdermal patches <b>58</b> suitable for administering medicaments as is appreciated by one skilled in the art. WO 02/43566 describes one such transdermal patch, which may be used in the preferred embodiments. Although the above-cited reference and description associated with the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5C</figref> describe a medicament (for example, glucagon) useful for treating hypoglycemia, it is understood that transdermal patches that release a medicament (for example, insulin) useful for treating hyperglycemia are also contemplated within the scope of the preferred embodiments.</p>
    <p num="p-0119"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5C</figref> are perspective views of an integrated system <b>10</b> in one embodiment, wherein a receiver <b>14</b> is integrated with a medicament delivery device <b>16</b> in the form of one or more transdermal patches <b>58</b> housed within a holder <b>56</b>, and optionally includes a single point glucose monitor <b>18</b>, which will be described in more detail elsewhere herein. The receiver <b>14</b> receives, processes, and displays data from the continuous glucose monitor <b>12</b>, such as described in more detail above. The medicament delivery device <b>16</b> is in the form of one or more transdermal patches <b>58</b> held in a holder <b>56</b>, which may comprise any known patch configuration.</p>
    <p num="p-0120">The integration of the patches <b>58</b> with the receiver <b>14</b> includes similar functionality and provides similar advantages as described with reference to other manual integrations including manual medicament delivery devices (for example, syringe and inhaler). However, a unique advantage may be seen in the integration of a continuous glucose sensor with a glucagon-type patch. Namely, a continuous glucose sensor, such as described in the preferred embodiments, provides more than single point glucose readings. In fact, because the continuous glucose sensor <b>12</b> knows the concentration, rate-of-change, acceleration, the amount of insulin administered (in some embodiments), and/or individual patterns associated with a patient's glucose trends (learned over time as described in more detail elsewhere herein), the use of the glucagon patch can be iteratively optimized (inputting its usage into the receiver and monitoring the individual's metabolic response) to proactively preempt hypoglycemic events and maintain a more controlled range of glucose values. This may be particularly advantageous for nighttime hypoglycemia by enabling the diabetic patient (and his/her caretakers) to improve overall nighttime diabetic health. While not wishing to be bound by theory, the integration of the continuous glucose sensor and transdermal glucagon-type patch can provide diabetic patients with a long-term solution to reduce or avoid hypoglycemic events.</p>
    <p num="p-0121">In some embodiments, the holder <b>58</b> is detachably connectable to the receiver <b>14</b> (for example on the side opposite the LCD), which enables convenient availability of the patch to the patient when the receiver indicates that a medicament (for example, glucose or glucagon) is recommended. It is further noted that although this holder is shown without another medicament delivery device <b>16</b> in the illustrations of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5C</figref>, other medicaments (for example, insulin pen, insulin pump, such as described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>) may be integrated into the system in combination with the medicament patch illustrated herein. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that by combining medicaments that aid the diabetic patient in different ways (for example, medicaments for treating hyper- and hypo-glycemic events, or, fast-acting and slow-acting medicaments), a simplified comprehensive solution for treating diabetes may be provided.</p>
    <p num="p-0122">Manual Integration of delivery devices with the continuous glucose sensor <b>12</b> of the preferred embodiments may additionally be advantageous because the continuous device of the preferred embodiments is able to track glucose levels long-term (for example weeks to months) and adaptively improve therapy decisions based on the patients response over time.</p>
    <p num="p-0123">In some alternative embodiments, the medicament delivery device <b>16</b> includes an inhaler or spray device suitable for administering a medicament into the circulatory system, as is appreciated by one skilled in the art. Some examples of inhalers suitable for use with the preferred embodiments include U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,167,880, 6,051,551, 6,024,090, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. In some embodiments, the inhaler or spray device is considered a manual medicament delivery device, such as described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, wherein the inhaler or spray is manually administered by a patient, and wherein the patient manually enters data into the continuous receiver about the time, amount, and types of therapy. However, it is also possible that the inhaler or spray device used for administering the medicament may also comprise a microprocessor and operable connection to the receiver (for example, RF), such that data is sent and received between the receiver and inhaler or spray device, making it a semi-automated integration, which is described in more detail with reference to the integrated insulin pen below, for example.</p>
    <p num="p-0124">In some embodiments, the inhaler or spray device is integrally housed within, detachably connected to, or otherwise physically associated with (for example, in a kit) to the receiver. The functionality and advantages for the integrated inhaler or spray device are similar to those described with reference to the syringe and/or patch integration, above. It is noted that the inhaler or spray device may be provided in combination with any other of the medicament delivery devices of the preferred embodiments, for example, a fast-acting insulin inhaler and a slow acting insulin pump may be advantageously integrated into the system of the preferred embodiments and utilized at the appropriate time as is appreciated by one skilled in the art. In some embodiments, wherein the inhaler or spray device includes a semi-automated integration with the receiver, the inhaler or spray device may by physically integrated with receiver such as described above and also operably connected to the receiver, for example via a wired (for example, via electrical contacts) or wireless (for example, via RF) connection.</p>
    <p num="p-0125">In one alternative embodiment, a manual medicament delivery pump is implanted such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,283,944, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In this alternative embodiment, the patient-controlled implantable pump allows the patient to press on the device (through the skin) to administer a bolus injection of a medicament when needed. It is believed that providing glucagon or other medicament for treating hypoglycemia within this device will provide the ease and convenience that can be easily released by the patient and/or his or her caretaker when the continuous glucose sensor indicates severe hypoglycemia, for example. In some alternative embodiments, the manual implantable pump is filled with insulin, or other medicament for treating hyperglycemia. In either case, the manual pump and continuous glucose sensor will benefit from manual integrations described in more detail above.</p>
    <p num="p-0126">In another alternative embodiment, a cell transplantation device, such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,015,572, 5,964,745, and 6,083,523, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, is manually integrated with the continuous sensor of the preferred embodiments. In this alternative embodiment, a patient would be implanted with beta islet cells, which provide insulin secretion responsive to glucose levels in the body. The receiver associated with the implantable glucose sensor can be programmed with information about the cell transplantation (for example, time, amount, type, etc). In this way, the long-term continuous glucose sensor may be used to monitor the body's response to the beta islet cells. This may be particularly advantageous when a patient has been using the continuous glucose sensor for some amount of time prior to the cell transplantation, and the change in the individual's metabolic patterns associated with the transplantation of the cells can be monitored and quantified. Because of the long-term continuous nature of the glucose sensor of the preferred embodiments, the long-term continuous effects of the cell transplantation can be consistently and reliably monitored. This integration may be advantageous to monitor any person's response to cell transplantation before and/or after the implantation of the cells, which may be helpful in providing data to justify the implantation of islet cells in the treatment of diabetes.</p>
    <p num="p-0127">It is noted that any of the manual medicament delivery devices can be provided with an RF ID tag or other communication-type device, which allows semi-automated integration with that manual delivery device, such as described in more detail below.</p>
    <p num="h-0012">Semi-Automated Integration</p>
    <p num="p-0128">Semi-automated integration of medicament delivery devices <b>16</b> in the preferred embodiments includes any integration wherein an operable connection between the integrated components aids the user (for example, patient or doctor) in selecting, inputting, or calculating the amount, type, or time of medicament delivery of glucose values, for example, by transmitting data to another component and thereby reducing the amount of user input required. In the preferred embodiments, semi-automated may also refer to a fully automated device (for example, one that does not require user interaction), wherein the fully automated device requires a validation or other user interaction, for example to validate or confirm medicament delivery amounts. In some embodiments, the semi-automated medicament delivery device is an inhaler or spray device, a pen or jet-type injector, or a transdermal or implantable pump.</p>
    <p num="p-0129"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> are perspective views of an integrated system <b>10</b> in one embodiment, wherein a receiver <b>14</b> is integrated with a medicament delivery device <b>16</b> in the form of a pen or jet-type injector, hereinafter referred to as a pen <b>60</b>, and optionally includes a single point glucose monitor <b>18</b>, which will be described in more detail elsewhere herein. The receiver <b>14</b> receives, processes, and displays data from the continuous glucose monitor <b>12</b>, such as described in more detail above. The medicament delivery pen <b>60</b> of the preferred embodiments, includes any pen-type injector, such as is appreciated by one skilled in the art. A few examples of medicament pens that may be used with the preferred embodiments, include U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,226,895, 4,865,591, 6,192,891, and 5,536,249, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
    <p num="p-0130"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is a perspective view of an integrated system <b>10</b> in embodiment.

The components <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, and <b>18</b> (optional) are also in operable connection with each other, which may include a wired or wireless connection. In some embodiments, the components include electrical contacts that operably connect the components together when in the attached state. In some embodiments, the components are operably connected via wireless connection (for example, RF), and wherein the components may or may not be detachably connectable to each other. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> show the components in an unattached state, which may be useful when the patient would like to carry minimal components and/or when the components are integrated via a wireless connection, for example.</p>
    <p num="p-0131">Medicament delivery pen <b>60</b> includes at least a microprocessor and a wired or wireless connection to the receiver <b>14</b>, which are described in more detail with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In some embodiments, the pen <b>60</b> includes programming that receives instructions sent from the receiver <b>14</b> regarding type and amount of medicament to administer. In some embodiments, wherein the pen includes more than one type of medicament, the receiver provides the necessary instructions to determine which type or types of medicament to administer, and may provide instructions necessary for mixing the one or more medicaments. In some embodiments, the receiver provides the glucose trend information (for example, concentration, rate-of-change, acceleration, or other user input information) and pen <b>60</b> includes programming necessary to determine appropriate medicament delivery.</p>
    <p num="p-0132">Subsequently, the pen <b>60</b> includes programming to send information regarding the amount, type, and time of medicament delivery to the receiver <b>14</b> for processing. The receiver <b>14</b> can use this information received from the pen <b>60</b>, in combination with the continuous glucose data obtained from the sensor, to monitor and determine the patient's glucose patterns to measure their response to each medicament delivery. Knowing the patient's individual response to each type and amount of medicament delivery may be useful in adjusting or optimizing the patient's therapy. It is noted that individual metabolic profiles (for example, insulin sensitivity) are variable from patient to patient. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that once the receiver has learned (for example, monitored and determined) the individual's metabolic patterns, including glucose trends and associated medicament deliveries, the receiver can be programmed to adjust and optimize the therapy recommendations for the patient's individual physiology to maintain their glucose levels within a desired target range. In alternative embodiments, the pen <b>60</b> may be manually integrated with the receiver.</p>
    <p num="p-0133">In some embodiments, the receiver includes algorithms that use parameters provided by the continuous glucose sensor, such as glucose concentration, rate-of-change of the glucose concentration, and acceleration of the glucose concentration to more particularly determine the type, amount, and time of medicament administration. In fact, all of the functionality of the above-described manual and semi-automated integrated systems, including therapy recommendations, adaptive programming for learning individual metabolic patterns, and prediction of glucose values, can be applied to the semi-automated integrated system <b>10</b>, such as described herein. However, the semi-automated integrated sensing and delivery system additionally provides convenience by automation (for example, data transfer through operable connection) and reduced opportunity for human error than may be experienced with the manual integration.</p>

In some embodiments, the receiver includes algorithms that use parameters provided by the continuous glucose sensor, such as glucose concentration, rate-of-change of the glucose concentration, and acceleration of the glucose concentration to determine the type, amount, and time of medicament administration. In fact, all of the functionality of the above-described manual and semi-automated integrated systems, including therapy recommendations, confirmation or validation of medicament delivery, adaptive programming for learning individual metabolic patterns, and prediction of glucose values, can be applied to the fully automated integrated system <b>10</b>, such as described herein with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 7C</figref>.

Another example of a situation that may benefit from a validation includes when a glucose values are showing a trend in a first direction that shows a possibility of “turn around,” namely, the patient may be able to reverse the trend with a particular behavior within a few minutes to an hour, for example. In such situations, the automated system may be programmed to revert to a semi-automated system requiring user validation or other user interaction to validate the therapy in view of the situation.</p>
    <p num="p-0140">It is noted that in the illustrated embodiment, only one receiver <b>14</b> is shown, which houses the electronics for both the medicament delivery pump <b>70</b> and the continuous sensor <b>12</b>.

Nos. 4,994,167 and 4,757,022, which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference. However, in alternative embodiments, the single point glucose monitor can use other measurement techniques such as optical, for example. It is noted that the meter is optional in that a separate meter can be used and the glucose data downloaded or input by a user into the receiver. However the illustrated embodiments show an integrated system that exploits the advantages associated with integration of the single point glucose monitor with the receiver <b>14</b> and delivery device <b>16</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0143"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 7</figref> are perspective views of integrated receivers including a single point glucose monitor. It is noted that the integrated single point glucose monitor may be integral with, detachably connected to, and/or operably connected (wired or wireless) to the receiver <b>14</b> and medicament delivery device <b>16</b>. The single point glucose monitor <b>18</b> integrates rapid and accurate measurement of the amount of glucose in a biological fluid and its associated processing with the calibration, validation, other processes associated with the continuous receiver <b>14</b>, such as described in more detail with reference to co-pending U.S. provisional patent application, 60/523,840, entitled “INTEGRATED RECEIVER FOR CONTINUOUS ANALYTE SENSOR,” which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
    <p num="p-0144">In the illustrated embodiments, the single point glucose monitor <b>18</b>, such as described in the above-cited co-pending provisional patent application, 60/523,840, includes a body <b>62</b> that houses a sensing region <b>64</b>, which includes a sensing membrane located within a port.

The sensing region includes electrodes, the top ends of which are in contact with an electrolyte phase (not shown), which is a free-flowing fluid phase disposed between the sensing membrane and the electrodes. The sensing region measures glucose in the biological sample in a manner such as described in more detail above, with reference the continuous glucose sensor and/or U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,994,167 and 4,757,022. The similarity of the measurement technologies used for the continuous glucose sensor and the single point glucose sensor provides an internal control that creates increased reliability by nature of consistency and decreased error potential that can otherwise be increased due to combining dissimilar measurement techniques. Additionally, the disclosed membrane system is known to provide longevity, repeatability, and cost effectiveness, for example as compared to single use strips, or the like. However, other single point glucose monitors may be used with the preferred embodiments.</p>

    <p num="h-0015">Integrated Electronics</p>
    <p num="p-0147"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a block diagram that illustrates integrated system electronics in one embodiment. One embodiment is described wherein the microprocessor within the receiver performs much of the processing, however it is understood that all or some of the programming and processing described herein can be accomplished within continuous glucose sensor, receiver, single point glucose monitor, and/or delivery device, or any combination thereof. Similarly, displays, alarms, and other user interface functions may be incorporated into any of the individual components of the integrated delivery device.</p>
    <p num="p-0148">A quartz crystal <b>76</b> is operably connected to an RF transceiver <b>78</b> that together function to receive and synchronize data streams via an antenna <b>80</b> (for example, transmission <b>40</b> from the RF transceiver <b>44</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Once received, a microprocessor <b>82</b> processes the signals, such as described below.</p>
    <p num="p-0149">The microprocessor <b>82</b> is the central control unit that provides the processing for the receiver, such as storing data, analyzing continuous glucose sensor data stream, analyzing single point glucose values, accuracy checking, checking clinical acceptability, calibrating sensor data, downloading data, recommending therapy instructions, calculating medicament delivery amount, type and time, learning individual metabolic patterns, and controlling the user interface by providing prompts, messages, warnings and alarms, or the like. The ROM <b>84</b> is operably connected to the microprocessor <b>82</b> and provides semi-permanent storage of data, storing data such as receiver ID and programming to process data streams (for example, programming for performing calibration and other algorithms described elsewhere herein). RAM <b>88</b> is used for the system's cache memory and is helpful in data processing. For example, the RAM <b>88</b> stores information from the continuous glucose sensor, delivery device, and/or single point glucose monitor for later recall by the user or a doctor; a user or doctor can transcribe the stored information at a later time to determine compliance with the medical regimen or evaluation of glucose response to medication administration (for example, this can be accomplished by downloading the information through the pc corn port <b>90</b>). In addition, the RAM <b>88</b> may also store updated program instructions and/or patient specific information. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> describe more detail about programming that is preferably processed by the microprocessor <b>82</b>. In some alternative embodiments, memory storage components comparable to ROM and RAM can be used instead of or in addition to the preferred hardware, such as SRAM, EEPROM, dynamic RAM, non-static RAM, rewritable ROMs, flash memory, or the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0150">In some embodiments, the microprocessor <b>82</b> monitors the continuous glucose sensor data stream <b>40</b> to determine a preferable time for capturing glucose concentration values using the single point glucose monitor electronics <b>116</b> for calibration of the continuous sensor data stream. For example, when sensor glucose data (for example, observed from the data stream) changes too rapidly, a single point glucose monitor reading may not be sufficiently reliable for calibration during unstable glucose changes in the host; in contrast, when sensor glucose data are relatively stable (for example, relatively low rate of change), a single point glucose monitor reading can be taken for a reliable calibration. In some additional embodiments, the microprocessor can prompt the user via the user interface to obtain a single point glucose value for calibration at predetermined intervals. In some additional embodiments, the user interface can prompt the user to obtain a single point glucose monitor value for calibration based upon certain events, such as meals, exercise, large excursions in glucose levels, faulty or interrupted data readings, or the like. In some embodiments, certain acceptability parameters can be set for reference values received from the single point glucose monitor. For example, in one embodiment, the receiver only accepts reference glucose data between about 40 and about 400 mg/dL.</p>
    <p num="p-0151">In some embodiments, the microprocessor <b>82</b> monitors the continuous glucose sensor data stream to determine a preferable time for medicament delivery, including type, amount, and time. In some embodiments, the microprocessor is programmed to detect impending clinical risk and may request data input, a reference glucose value from the single point glucose monitor, or the like, in order to confirm a therapy recommendation. In some embodiments, the microprocessor is programmed to process continuous glucose data and medicament therapies to adaptive adjust to an individual's metabolic patterns. In some embodiments, the microprocessor is programmed to project glucose trends based on data from the integrated system (for example, medicament delivery information, user input, or the like). In some embodiments, the microprocessor is programmed to calibrate the continuous glucose sensor based on the integrated single point glucose monitor. Numerous other programming may be incorporated into the microprocessor, as is appreciated by one skilled in the art, as is described in cited patents and patent applications here, and as is described with reference to flowcharts of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 11</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0152">It is noted that one advantage of integrated system of the preferred embodiments can be seen in the time stamp of the sensor glucose data, medicament delivery data, and reference glucose data. Namely, typical implementations of the continuous glucose sensor <b>12</b>, wherein the medicament delivery <b>16</b> and/or single point glucose monitor <b>18</b> is not integral with the receiver <b>14</b>, the reference glucose data or medicament delivery data can be obtained at a time that is different from the time that the data is input into the receiver <b>14</b>. Thus, the user may not accurately input the “time stamp” of the delivery or (for example, the time or obtaining reference glucose value or administering the medicament) at the time of reference data input into the receiver. Therefore, the accuracy of the calibration of the continuous sensor, prediction of glucose values, therapy recommendations, and other processing is subject to human error (for example, due to inconsistencies in entering the actual time of the single point glucose test). In contrast, the preferred embodiments of the integrated system advantageously do no suffer from this potential inaccuracy when the time stamp is automatically and accurately obtained at the time of the event. Additionally, the processes of obtaining reference data and administering the medicament may be simplified and made convenient using the integrated receiver because of fewer loose parts (for example, cable, test strips, etc.) and less required manual data entry.</p>
    <p num="p-0153">A battery <b>92</b> is operably connected to the microprocessor <b>82</b> and provides power for the receiver.

In one exemplary embodiment, the receiver is able to download historical data to a physician's PC for retrospective analysis by the physician. The PC communication port <b>90</b> can also be used to interface with other medical devices, for example pacemakers, implanted analyte sensor patches, infusion devices, telemetry devices, or the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0155">A user interface <b>96</b> comprises a keyboard <b>98</b>, speaker <b>100</b>, vibrator <b>102</b>, backlight <b>104</b>, liquid crystal display (LCD) <b>106</b>, and/or one or more buttons <b>108</b>. The components that comprise the user interface <b>96</b> provide controls to interact with the user.

The microprocessor can set the analog gain via its a control port (not shown). The A/D converter is preferably activated at one-second intervals. The microprocessor looks at the converter output with any number of pattern recognition algorithms known to those skilled in the art until a glucose peak is identified. A timer is then preferably activated for about 30 seconds at the end of which time the difference between the first and last electrode current values is calculated. This difference is then divided by the value stored in the memory during instrument calibration and is then multiplied by the calibration glucose concentration. The glucose value in milligram per deciliter, millimoles per liter, or the like, is then stored in the microprocessor, displayed on the user interface, used to calibrate of the glucose sensor data stream, downloaded, etc.</p>

    <p num="p-0164"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flow chart that illustrates the process <b>130</b> of validating therapy instructions prior to medicament delivery in one embodiment. In some embodiments, the therapy recommendations include a suggestion on the user interface of time, amount, and type of medicament to delivery. In some embodiments, therapy instructions includes calculating a time, amount, and/or type of medicament delivery to administer, and optionally transmitting those instructions to the delivery device. In some embodiments, therapy instructions include that portion of a closed loop system wherein the determination and delivery of medicament is accomplished, as is appreciated by one skilled in the art.</p>
    <p num="p-0165">Although computing and processing of data is increasingly complex and reliable, there are circumstances by which the therapy recommendations necessitate human intervention. Some examples include when a user is about to alter his/her metabolic state, for example due to behavior such as exercise, meal, pending manual medicament delivery, or the like. In such examples, the therapy recommendations determined by the programming may not have considered present or upcoming behavior, which may change the recommended therapy. Numerous such circumstances can be contrived, suffice it to say that a validation may be advantageous in order to ensure that therapy recommendations are appropriately administered.</p>
    <p num="p-0166">At block <b>132</b>, a sensor data receiving module, also referred to as the sensor data module, receives sensor data (e.g., a data stream), including one or more time-spaced sensor data points, from a sensor via the receiver, which may be in wired or wireless communication with the sensor. The sensor data point(s) may be raw or smoothed, such as described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser.

In some embodiments, the validation requests and/or considers additional input, such as time of day, meals, sleep, calories, exercise, sickness, or the like. In some embodiments, the validation module is configured to request this information from the user. In some embodiments, the validation module is responsive to a user inputting such information.</p>
    <p num="p-0169">In some embodiments, when the integrated system <b>10</b> is in fully automated mode, the validation module is triggered when a potential risk is evaluated. For example, when a clinically risky discrepancy is evaluated, when the acceleration of the glucose value is changing or is low (indicative of a significant change in glucose trend), when it is near a normal meal, exercise or sleep time, when a medicament delivery is expected based on an individual's dosing patterns, and/or a variety of other such situations, wherein outside influences (meal time, exercise, regular medicament delivery, or the like) may deem consideration in the therapy instructions. These conditions for triggering the validation module may be pre-programmed and/or may be learned over time, for example, as the processor module monitors and patterns an individual's behavior patterns.</p>
    <p num="p-0170">In some embodiments, when the integrated system <b>10</b> is in semi-automated mode, the system may be programmed to request additional information from the user regarding outside influences unknown to the integrated system prior to validation.

    <p num="p-0171">At block <b>138</b>, the receiver confirms and sends (for example, displays, transmits and/or delivers) the therapy recommendations. In manual integrations, the receiver may simply confirm and display the recommended therapy, for example. In semi-automated integrations, the receiver may confirm, transmit, and optionally delivery instructions to the delivery device regarding the recommended therapy, for example. In automated integrations the receiver may confirm and ensure the delivery of the recommended therapy; for example.

In some embodiments, the recommended therapy is validated such as described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> above. In some embodiments, the recommended therapy is manually, semi-automatically, or automatically delivered to the patient.</p>
    <p num="p-0177">At block <b>150</b>, the process of monitoring and evaluation a patient's metabolic profile is repeated with new medicament delivery data, wherein the processor monitors the sensor data with the associated medicament delivery data to determine the individual's metabolic response in order to adaptively adjust, if necessary, to newly determined metabolic profile or patterns. This process may be continuous throughout the life of the integrated system, may be initiated based on conditions met by the continuous glucose sensor, may be triggered by a patient or doctor, or may be provided during a start-up or learning phase.</p>

No. 10/633,367 and provisional patent application 60/528,382, both of which have been incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. However, the preferred embodiments described herein, further incorporated additional data of medicament delivery in estimating or predicting glucose trends.</p>
    <p num="p-0180">At block <b>154</b>, a sensor data receiving module, also referred to as the sensor data module, receives sensor data (e.g., a data stream), including one or more time-spaced sensor data points, from a sensor via the receiver, which may be in wired or wireless communication with the sensor.</p>
    <p num="p-0181">At block <b>156</b>, the medicament data receiving module, which may be programmed within the receiver <b>14</b> and/or medicament delivery device <b>16</b>, receives medicament delivery data, including time, amount, and/or type.</p>
    <p num="p-0182">At block <b>158</b>, the processor module evaluates medicament delivery data with substantially time corresponding glucose sensor data to determine individual metabolic patterns associated with medicament delivery. “Substantially time corresponding data” refers to that time period during which the medicament is delivered and its period of release in the host.</p>
    <p num="p-0183">At block <b>160</b>, the processor module estimates glucose values responsive to individual metabolic patterns associated with the medicament delivery. Namely, the individual metabolic patterns associated with the medicament delivery are incorporated into the algorithms that estimate present and future glucose values, which are believed to increase accuracy of long-term glucose estimation.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLES</heading> <p num="p-0184">In one exemplary implementation of the preferred embodiments, the continuous glucose sensor (and its receiver) comprises programming to track a patient during hypoglycemic or near-hypoglycemic conditions. In this implementation, the processor includes programming that sends instructions to administer a hypoglycemic treating medicament, such as glucagon, via an implantable pump or the like, when the glucose level and rate of change surpass a predetermined threshold (for example, 80 mg/dL and 2 mg/dL/min). In this situation, the sensor waits a predetermined amount of time (for example, 40 minutes), while monitoring the glucose level, rate of change of glucose, and/or acceleration/deceleration of glucose in the patient, wherein if the rate of change and/or acceleration shows a changing trend away from hypoglycemia (for example, decreased deceleration of glucose levels to non-hypoglycemia, then the patient need not be alarmed. In this way, the automated glucagon delivery device can proactively preempt hypoglycemic conditions without alerting or awaking the patient.</p>
    <p num="p-0185">In another exemplary implementation of the preferred embodiments, a continuous glucose sensor is integrated with a continuous medicament delivery device (for example, an insulin pump) and a bolus medicament delivery device (for example, and insulin pen). In this embodiment, the integration takes exploits the benefits of automated and semi-automated device, for example, providing an automated integration with an infusion pump, while provide semi-automated integration with an insulin pen as necessary.</p>
    <p num="p-0186">In yet another exemplary implementation of the preferred embodiments, a medicament delivery device is provided that includes reservoirs of both fast acting insulin and slow acting insulin. The medicament delivery device is integrated with the receiver as described elsewhere herein, however in this implementation, the receiver determines an amount of fast acting insulin and an amount of slow acting insulin, wherein the medicament delivery device is configured to mix slow- and fast-acting insulin in the amounts provided. In this way, the receiver and medicament delivery device can work together in a feedback loop to iteratively optimize amounts of slow and fast acting insulin for a variety of situations (for example, based on glucose level, rate of change, acceleration, and behavioral factors such as diet, exercise, time of day, etc.) adapted to the individual patient's metabolic profile.</p>
    <p num="p-0187">In yet another exemplary implementation of the preferred embodiments, an integrated hypo- and hyper-glycemic treating system is provided. In this implementation, a manual-, semi-automated, or automated integration of an insulin delivery device is combined with a manual-, semi-automated, or automated integration of a glucose or glucagon delivery device. These devices are integrated with the receiver for the continuous glucose sensor in any manner described elsewhere herein. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the combination of a continuous glucose sensor, integrated insulin device, and integrated glucose or glucagon device provides a simplified, comprehensive, user friendly, convenient, long-term and continuous method of monitoring, treating, and optimizing comprehensive care for diabetes.</p>
