<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">This invention relates generally to flush-mounted window assemblies for vehicles and more particularly, to flush-mounted vehicular window assemblies which articulate about a hinge attached to one side of the window in a manner to achieve long-term reliability.</p>
  <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0004">In an effort to make automobiles more fuel-efficient, automobile exterior designs are becoming more streamlined. To achieve this goal, automobile manufacturers are requiring flush-mounted panel and window assemblies. The goal is to locate the panel or window within the vehicle such that the peripheral edge of the panel or window assembly is recessed and the outer surface of the panel is generally flush with any adjoining body panels. In the case of fixed panels, a conventional technique includes placing or running a bead of adhesive material around the entire inside peripheral edge of the panel and bonding it in the vehicle opening. While satisfactory for stationary windows, this method creates problems with movable windows, however, particularly those which articulate about a hinge.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">Conventional articulated or hinged windows are fixed to the vehicle by a mounting assembly which is fastened by a stud passing through a hole drilled in the panel. A low profile nut is then threaded onto the stud extending through the panel to retain the panel thereon. A major disadvantage is that a significant number of glass panels are broken as a result of drilling the holes through the panel. The panels art also broken during or after mounting of the mounting hardware. To avoid the breakage of the glass panel, sophisticated techniques have been adopted to drill the holes, and the mounting hardware has been adapted to reduce breakage. As a result, the price of such panel assemblies is unnecessarily high. Moreover, the resulting panel is not truly flush since the mounting hardware has a positive relief with respect to the panel exterior surface.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">Another attempt to reduce the exterior profile of articulated window assemblies is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,396,221 which employs a channel extending around the edge of the window pane, a flexible resilient portion allowing pivotal movement of the window pane, and one of several types of fasteners. Such fasteners include a clip with a detent received in the seal and securing the hinge and thus the assembly to a pinch weld flange.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">Another embodiment of the hinged window assembly just described includes a substantially rectilinear hinge member which includes a retaining end bonded to the exterior or front surface of the window panel by an adhesive and an opposing retaining end having an aperture which receives a metal screw extending into the vehicle body. Seated on the pinch-weld flange is a sealing weather strip which forms a closed bulbous portion engaging both the inside surface of the pane as well as a shoulder of the recess leading to the pinch weld flange on the exterior sheet metal body portion. To conceal the fastener for the hinge, a metal covering extending from the vehicle roof or another portion of the vehicle may extend over the fastener and a substantial portion of the hinge.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">A disadvantage associated with each of the above hinged windows is that the hinge member is fixed to the exterior surface of the panel. In addition, in the last embodiment described above, the fastener securing the assembly to the vehicle is exposed, or must include a special cover member. Accordingly, the exterior profile of these window assemblies do not result in a truly flush-mounted, articulated window assembly.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">Although known in the art to adhesively bond metal to glass for a variety of purposes such as stud attachments, small hinge plates, etc., known hinge adhesives and hinge designs are inadequate to meet load requirements and long-term environmental resilience required for flush-mounted, hinged window assemblies. Hinge mounting of large size, flush-mounted panels in the nature of van windows is a demanding application of adhesive technology. The higher weight of such a window transmits more severe vibration requiring greater strength and greater long-term environmental resilience and durability than is available with such prior known bonds. Styling and design limitations restrict the number of hinges and the size of the bond areas.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">Accordingly, there is now a need for large panels such as van or tailgate windows having a flush mounted hinge, and an improved bond between a hinge member and the single panel surface to which it is attached to support the panel.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0011">The present invention includes a unique articulated window assembly especially for vehicles, and a method for manufacturing the panel assembly.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">The panel assembly of this invention is especially useful as a flush-mounted vehicle window assembly, and includes, in combination, a panel having inner and outer surfaces which terminate in a peripheral edge and give the panel a predetermined geometric shape. At least one mounting member is secured to the inner surface of the panel and spaced from the peripheral edge. An adhesive is used to bond a flange of the mounting member to the inner surface of the panel. The resulting bond between the mounting member flange and the panel is sufficiently strong such that when a load sufficient to induce failure is imposed between the mounting member and the panel, failure of the panel assembly results other than in the adhesion of the adhesive to the mounting member or panel. More specifically, failure may occur as cohesive failure of the adhesive, mechanical failure or the mounting member adjacent the adhesive, or mechanical failure of the panel adjacent the adhesive. The bond is preferably strong enough to withstand a failure load of at least 150 pounds.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">One embodiment of the invention includes an articulated window assembly for use in a vehicle wherein the window assembly is mounted in the window opening from the inner surface with the opposite surface generally flush with the exterior surface of the vehicle. The articulated window assembly includes, in combination, a transparent sheet having inner and outer surfaces terminating in a peripheral edge and defining a shape to fit within the window opening. At least one window-mounting member is bonded to the inner surface of the sheet at a position spaced inwardly from the peripheral edge and fixing the sheet in the window opening. The mounting member may include a plurality of projections extending therefrom for spacing the mounting member from the inner surface of the sheet by a predetermined distance. One or more adhesives are provided between the inner surface of the sheet and the mounting member for bonding the sheet and mounting member together in such a manner that when tested under a straight pull test of more than 150 pounds applied at a rate greater than 25 millimeters per minute, failure will occur generally in the sheet, the mounting member or the cohesiveness of the adhesive will fail, but the adhesion of the adhesive to the sheet or mounting member will not fail. Such strength is also maintained after soaking in 80° C. water for at least 100 hours.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">Another embodiment of the invention includes a hinged window panel having a shape to fit within the window opening of a vehicle with an outer surface of the peripheral edge aligned generally flush with an outer surface of the window opening. At least one hinge assembly includes a flange portion which is located on the inner surface of the panel inwardly from the peripheral edge and a hinged portion for engaging the window opening. At least one latch-mounting member is provided having a base portion located oil the inner surface of the panel inwardly from the peripheral edge and spaced from the hinge assembly. The latch-mounting member also includes an end portion to receive a latch interconnected to the inside of the window opening. A first adhesive is optionally provided having a quick set-up time, for temporarily fixturing the hinge assembly and the latch-mounting member to the inner surface of the panel. A second adhesive is then provided for permanently bonding the hinge assembly and latch member to the inner surface of the panel and has a set-up or cure time greater than the first adhesive.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">According to additional aspects of the invention, the panel or transparent sheet may further include an opaque coating such as a ceramic frit between the inner surface of the panel and the adhesive bonding the mounting member, hinge or latch member, to the panel. An adhesion-promoting compound may also be applied to the opaque coating, mounting member, hinge or latch-mounting member, to enhance the bond with the adhesive.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">The panel assemblies of this invention have advantages over the prior art in that the mounting members do not need to be fixed by holes drilled through the panel yet provide a strong and resilient bond between the panel and the vehicle. Another advantage is that the mounting members no longer wrap around the exterior edge of the window panel or are exposed on the exterior of the window panel. Moreover, the panel assembly of this invention may be manufactured rapidly without complex machines, and is highly adapted for support of larger sized, heavier windows in vehicles in which significant vibration is encountered. Because the mounting members are fixed to the panel by an adhesive, fewer panels are broken during the manufacturing process. A still further advantage of the panel assembly of this invention is that the mounting members do not extend through and protrude from the panel, but are concealed on the inner surface of the panel which results in a flush, more streamlined and aesthetically pleasing panel assembly appearance.</p>
  <p num="p-0017">The above advantages, purposes and other features of the invention will become apparent from a study of the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the appended drawing figures.</p>

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p num="p-0036">Although this invention relates to flush-mounted articulated window panels for vehicles such as vehicle <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>′ or <b>10</b>″ in FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>16</b>-<b>18</b> representing a van, station wagon, utility vehicle or truck, the advantages of this invention are best realized in large flush-mounted articulated window panels such as used in side windows <b>12</b> for vans (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), or rear windows <b>17</b>, or rear lift gate windows or tailgate windows <b>17</b> <i>a </i>for vans, station wagons, utility vehicles, and trucks as shown in FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>16</b>-<b>18</b>, and other vehicles such as aeronautical, nautical, rail, and other forms of transportation, which exert substantial loads on the bonds between the mounting hardware and the window panel, such window panels having surface areas typically greater than 250 square inches.</p>
  <p num="p-0037">Referring now to the drawings in greater detail, panel assembly <b>12</b> of the present invention is disposed on a vehicle <b>10</b> within a window opening <b>14</b> formed in the vehicle exterior <b>16</b>. Panel or window assembly <b>12</b> is adapted to articulate or pivot about a pair of mounting members <b>30</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>) positioned proximate peripheral edge <b>18</b> of inside surface <b>22</b>. Panel assembly <b>12</b> is opened or closed about mounting members <b>30</b> by a second mounting member <b>32</b> adapted to receive an actuator <b>33</b>, <b>33</b> <i>a </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>8</b> and <b>8</b>A), which may be one of several types as explained below, interconnecting the vehicle <b>10</b> to a second portion of panel assembly <b>12</b> distant and spaced from mounting members <b>30</b>. Although panel assembly <b>12</b> is shown pivoting about mounting members <b>30</b> along an axis proximate the leading peripheral edge <b>18</b>, it is contemplated that this invention may also be used to articulate panels such as a rear window <b>17</b> or tailgate window <b>17</b> <i>a </i>about a horizontal axis as well as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, and <b>16</b>-<b>18</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0038">In one embodiment, panel assembly <b>12</b> includes a panel or sheet <b>24</b> having outer and inner surfaces <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, respectively. Panel <b>24</b> is preferably transparent glass which may be tempered, laminated, or otherwise strengthened using conventional techniques and principles. Panel <b>24</b> may be curved, bent or generally planar, having two substantially parallel sides, surfaces, or faces <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> terminating in a peripheral edge <b>18</b> forming a panel having a predetermined geometric shape. Although transparent glass is preferred, other sheet-like panel materials may also be used, such as opaque or coated glass, transparent coated or opaque plastic materials, or multi-composite laminates, such as transparent glass and plastic.</p>
  <p num="p-0039">Optionally and preferably, deposited on and bonded to surface <b>22</b> of panel <b>24</b> is an opaque, and preferably black frit layer <b>26</b>, and most preferably, a ceramic frit layer or coating covering and concealing a region of surface <b>22</b> from peripheral edge <b>18</b> inward. Alternatively, frit layer <b>26</b> may cover all or substantially all of surface <b>22</b>. Usually, however, frit layer <b>26</b> conceals a continuous peripheral strip of surface <b>22</b> near edge <b>18</b>, such as two inches in from edge <b>18</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0040">Glass panel <b>24</b>, which is initially in an untempered condition after cutting and sizing to its desired shape, can be painted by screen coating or other techniques, with a coating of dark ceramic paint on its inner surface <b>22</b>. Thereafter, glass panel <b>24</b> is heated and bent to the desired contour with a bending furnace or other bending apparatus, followed by tempering to strengthen the glass. Such heating, bending and tempering, operations cause the ceramic paint <b>26</b> to become fused to surface <b>22</b>. Thus, although starting as a layer of paint containing ceramic particles and pigment, coating <b>26</b> ends up after bending and tempering, as a thin frit layer of ceramic material, which, in actuality, is fused to surface <b>22</b> of glass panel <b>24</b>. Since ceramic frit coating <b>26</b> includes a pigment of a desired color, preferably a dark color such as black or the like, the layer results in a permanent, second or inside surface coloration of glass panel <b>24</b>. When viewed from the opposite or outer side <b>20</b>, the transparent thickness of panel <b>24</b>, backed up by the colored ceramic frit layer <b>26</b>, provides an appearance of depth and richness which blends well with the surrounding painted or glass areas on a vehicle.</p>
  <p num="p-0041">One ceramic paint used to form the opaque black ceramic frit coating <b>26</b>, described above, is manufactured by the Drakenfeld Pigments Division of Ciba-Geigy Corporation located in Washington, Pa. Such paint includes small ceramic particles and a suitable metal oxide pigment suspended in oil of a type conventionally known in the art. The resulting frit layer is opaque and normally black in color. This ceramic paint is preferably screen-coated on a predetermined portion of inner surface <b>20</b> of panel <b>24</b> using a 200-mesh screen. Ceramic particles in layer <b>26</b> are melted and fused to one another, are permanently bonded and fused to the inner glass surface <b>22</b>, and form the equivalent of the glass itself in terms of strength and adherence.</p>
  <p num="p-0042">Fixed to ceramic frit layer <b>26</b> and spaced inwardly from peripheral edge <b>18</b> toward the center of the panel are at least one, and preferably no more than two, mounting members <b>30</b>, and at least one member <b>32</b> which cooperate to retain and articulate panel assembly <b>24</b> within window opening <b>14</b>. Each mounting member <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, is bonded at least 0.125 inch inboard of peripheral edge <b>18</b> to panel inner surface <b>22</b> to retain panel <b>24</b> within window opening <b>14</b> without the need to extend a fastener through the sheet-like panel <b>24</b> or encapsulate the peripheral edge <b>18</b> of panel <b>24</b> with a resinous gasket extending around the panel edge on both inner and outer surfaces or the like. Described in greater detail below, the bond between mounting members <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> and glass panel <b>24</b> and/or frit layer <b>26</b> is sufficient to withstand loads greater than 150 pounds, preferably greater than 250 pounds, and most preferably about 300 pounds, even after environmental exposure. The resulting bond is such that if failure occurs under these loads, the failure mode is other than in the adhesive bond interface between mounting members <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> and panel <b>24</b>. That is to say, if a failure occurs in the bond between mounting members <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> and panel <b>24</b> under a load, the failure mode will be a mechanical failure of the substrate (mounting member or panel) or in the cohesion of the adhesive itself. For the purposes of this description, the adhesive bond or adhesion of the adhesive with the mounting member or panel is the ability of the adhesive to adhere to the substrate. Cohesion is the ability of the adhesive to bond with itself.</p>
  <p num="p-0043">In one embodiment (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>), each mounting member <b>30</b> is a 0.1 to 10.0 millimeter (mm) thick, and preferably 0.5 to 1.0 mm thick, 1050 spring steel hinge having an elongate flange portion <b>34</b> with one edge <b>36</b> defining an adjoining tab <b>38</b>. Tab <b>38</b> is offset from the plane of flange <b>34</b> by leg <b>37</b>. Tab <b>38</b> is thus bent in an S-shaped form with respect to flange <b>34</b> although the free end portion tab <b>38</b> is generally parallel to flange <b>34</b>. The bends between tab <b>38</b> and flange <b>34</b>, and particularly leg <b>37</b>, provide a spring-like hinge, the operation of which will become readily apparent below. Hinge flange <b>34</b> may also be prestressed or bent to conform to the surface of panel <b>24</b>, especially if the panel is curved. In this regard, it is desirable to have a convex curvature to the surface or hinge flange <b>34</b> that is adhesively bonded to panel surface <b>24</b>. This results in not only a more uniform adhesive bond, but also evenly distributes any load along the bonding surface and economizes the amount of adhesive used. Extending through tab <b>38</b> and away from panel <b>24</b> is a stud <b>52</b>, having a head <b>53</b> bonded with or welded to tab <b>38</b>. The opposite end of stud <b>52</b> is to be fastened to the vehicle as explained below.</p>
  <p num="p-0044">Optionally, formed in flange portion <b>34</b>, and extending therethrough, are a plurality of holes <b>40</b> generally aligned along the longitudinal axis of the flange. The size of each hole may range from 0.1 to 10 mm or more, but is preferably about 3.0 millimeters. In the preferred embodiment, holes <b>40</b> are spaced equidistantly from each other with the center points between the holes being approximately eight and one-half millimeters apart. The size and spacing of holes <b>40</b> are designed to provide optimum access of both air and moisture/humidity to permeate to an underlying adhesive described in greater detail below. The perforations also reduce the weight of each hinge, and provide a mechanical surface to bond with the adhesive and aid in bonding the hinge to the panel.</p>
  <p num="p-0045">Flange portion <b>34</b> also contains embossments <b>42</b> adjacent aligned holes <b>40</b> which extend from a lower surface <b>44</b> of flange <b>34</b> and serve to space flange <b>34</b> from the inner surface <b>22</b> of panel <b>24</b>. In a preferred embodiment, embossments <b>42</b> extend from flange <b>34</b> by a distance on the order of 0.1 to 3.0 mm, and preferably 1.0 mm. The actual distance may vary depending on the type of adhesive used. However, this offset distance has been found to be quite adequate for the variety of adhesives described below. Holes <b>40</b> and embossments <b>42</b> may be easily formed in flange portion <b>34</b> by stamping or punching during the formation of spring hinge <b>30</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0046">For panel assemblies employing a single hinge <b>30</b>, it is preferred that the surface area of flange <b>34</b> bonded to panel <b>24</b> be approximately between 4 square inches and 50 square inches, and most preferably approximately 15 square inches. On a two hinge system, each hinge would preferably have a bonding area approximately between 2 and 50 inches square, and most preferably on the order of 4 square inches. A hinge bonding area of 4 square inches is about 1.6% of the surface area of a window panel having a surface area of 250 square inches. The aspect ratio (ratio of length to width) of each hinge, no matter whether a single hinge or dual hinge system, is preferably greater than 1 but less than 1,000, and most preferably approximately 8 to 10. Dimensions may vary depending upon the specific application. However, the hinge design is intended to provide the most bonding strength and structural stability economically and concealing the hinge in the frit area on the panel.</p>
  <p num="p-0047">Although hinge <b>30</b> is described as being made from spring steel, other materials may also be used such as cold rolled steel, plastics, composite materials and other materials which are capable of withstanding flexural or bending moments. These materials will become apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
  <p num="p-0048">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, flange <b>34</b> of hinge <b>30</b> has its lower surface <b>44</b> bonded to fit layer <b>26</b> by a first and second adhesive <b>46</b> and <b>48</b>, respectively, In a preferred embodiment, adhesive <b>48</b> is a temporary fixturing adhesive such as a hot melt thermoplastic, which temporarily locates or fixtures hinge <b>30</b> against fit <b>26</b>, while adhesive <b>46</b> cures and forms the permanent primary bond. Adhesive <b>46</b> may be selected from a number of adhesives classes including moisture-activated urethanes such as described in U.S. No. 3,707,521 incorporated herein by reference, moisture-activated silicones, moisture-curable activated urethanes, chemically-activated adhesives, and thermally-activated adhesives, such as shown in Table 1 below. Other adhesives, such as aerobically-cured, anaerobically-cured, and radiation-cured adhesives can also be used. When cured, the bond-line thickness is in the range of 1 micron to 10 mm, preferably 5 microns to 5 mm, and most preferably 25 microns to 1 mm. For large area vehicle windows where load integrity over a long surface life and through extreme climatic conditions is critical, thermosetting adhesives such as urethanes, silicones, acrylates, and epoxies are preferred over thermoplastic adhesives such as polyvinylbutyral. For moisture-activated adhesives, it is preferable that the assemblies be exposed to a high humidity atmosphere after initial bonding is achieved in order to promote rapid, complete cure of the adhesive. In this regard, it is preferable that the assemblies be exposed to a relative humidity in excess of 40 percent R.H. and preferably, in excess of 75 percent R.H. for a time period ranging from about 30 minutes to approximately 24 hours, or longer, and at a temperature range from about 60° F. to about 250° F., preferably about 75° F. to about 110° F. Chemically-activated adhesives can be activated by means such as catalysts, curing agents, and their equivalents as conventionally known in the adhesive arts. Activation can be promoted by heat and/or by radiation including ultraviolet radiation and microwave radiation. Thermally-activated adhesives may be activated by a variety of heating means including convective heating, infrared heating, focused infrared heating, inductive or induction heating, conductive heating, microwave heating and their equivalents such as are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 897,764, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,331,784. Cure of the bond joint and the assemblies can be promoted and achieved by use of ovens, high humidity chambers, conveyors, heaters and by their combination.</p>

It is further preferred that the selected adhesive come in a single package so that no mixing of reactants need occur prior to application. The one-package adhesives provide a much more efficient method than prior adhesives requiring mixing or reactants. It is further preferred that the adhesive have a jelly-like consistency, preferably having a viscosity at 25° C. greater than 5 Poise, and most preferably greater than 100 Poise, or can also be a hot-melted adhesive, or in film form for easy application. Adhesive <b>46</b> is preferably a urethane adhesive and most preferably a moisture-activated adhesive urethane such as Morton Yokohama WS70-FK, available from Morton International of Ridgewood, Ill., although epoxies and activated adhesives may also be used. Stand-offs or embossments <b>42</b> provide a space between hinge flange <b>34</b> and the surface of frit layer <b>26</b> for adhesive <b>46</b>. In addition, holes <b>40</b> extending the length of hinge flange <b>34</b> allow adhesive <b>46</b> to be extruded therethrough to provide a mechanical coupling due to the extension of adhesive over the edges of the holes <b>40</b>, as well as to provide an avenue for the permeation of moisture to complete the cure of the adhesive.
</p>
  <p num="p-0050">To improve and promote the bonding characteristics of adhesive <b>46</b> glass inner surface <b>22</b> or frit layer <b>26</b>, and/or the lower surface <b>44</b> of hinge flange <b>34</b> may be coated with an adhesion-promoting compound or primer <b>50</b>. These adhesion-promoting compounds generally include silanes such as available from Dow Corning, or titanium or zirconium coupling agents such as available from Kenrich Petrochemical, Inc., of Bayon, N.J., or equivalents, which greatly enhance the bonding ability of the adhesive to the substrate. If the primer <b>50</b> is applied to frit layer <b>26</b> or onto glass surface <b>22</b>, a preferred primer is designated Morton Yokohama MS-90 available from Morton International in Ridgewood, Ill. If primer <b>50</b> is applied to a metallic surface such as hinge flange <b>34</b>, a preferred primer is Morton Yokohama RC-50, also available from Morton International. Although these two primers are preferred, they are not the only primers available which may be equally if not more suitable for the application. Although the adhesion-promoting compound <b>50</b> may be applied to frit coating <b>26</b> and to lower surface <b>44</b> of Range <b>34</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> illustrate the primer compound only on frit coating <b>26</b>. Adhesive <b>46</b>, combined with adhesion-promoting compound or primer <b>50</b>, provides a bond between frit coating <b>26</b> and hinge <b>30</b>, which exceeds standards established by many U.S. automobile manufacturers for window panels. Bonding strengths will vary depending upon the bonding surface area and the types of base materials used. Based upon the materials described herein, the majority of bonds withstood straight pull tests of more than 150 pounds applied at a rate of 25 millimeters per minute without a failure of the cohesion or adhesion after environmental exposure.</p>
  <p num="p-0051">In a first embodiment of window panel assembly <b>12</b>, two hinges <b>30</b>, such as described above, are bonded to frit coating <b>26</b> inwardly from peripheral edge <b>18</b> and spaced from each other so as to provide generally balanced support for panel assembly <b>12</b>. To locate panel assembly <b>12</b> within window opening <b>14</b>, a mounting stud <b>52</b> passing through hinge flange or tab <b>38</b> is received through an opening <b>54</b> formed in a pinch weld flange <b>56</b> which defines window opening <b>14</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). Stud <b>52</b> is then retained within hole <b>54</b> by a suitable fastener. In the alternative, stud <b>52</b> may be replaced with a self-anchoring fastener such as a Christmas-tree post or other similar fastener.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">Distant from hinges <b>30</b>, and preferably at an opposite end of panel assembly <b>12</b>, is at least one mounting member or latch mount <b>32</b>. See <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>. In a preferred embodiment, mounting member <b>32</b> is a mounting stud having a disk or circular-shaped flange <b>60</b> made from 1.0 millimeter thick, 1010 cold rolled steel. Disk <b>60</b> has a lower surface <b>62</b> which is concave, and an upper surface <b>64</b> which is convex, as a result of contours formed by several concentric rings or shoulders <b>78</b>, <b>80</b>, respectively, formed in disk <b>60</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0053">Formed in disk <b>60</b> and spaced equidistantly from each other, are a plurality of embossments <b>42</b> which define stand-offs extending from lower surface <b>62</b> of disk <b>60</b> similar to those described above. Between embossments <b>42</b>, and preferably spaced equidistantly from each other, are holes or rotated lances <b>66</b> piercing disk <b>60</b>. Holes or rotated lances <b>66</b> are formed from lower surface <b>62</b> through to surface <b>64</b>. Rotated lances are formed in such a manner so as to produce a tag or vane <b>72</b> inclined above each hole <b>66</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> <i>a</i>).</p>
  <p num="p-0054">Extending upwardly from surface <b>64</b> through a hole <b>70</b> located generally in the center of disk <b>60</b> is a stud <b>68</b>. Stud <b>68</b> is permanently fixed to disk <b>60</b> by welding flange <b>74</b> to lower surface <b>62</b>. Flange <b>74</b> of stud <b>68</b> lies substantially within the uppermost concave portion <b>76</b> of surface <b>62</b> to provide a maximum offset between stud flange <b>74</b> and panel <b>24</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0055">Disk <b>60</b> is bonded to panel <b>24</b> in generally the same manner as hinge <b>30</b> described above. The inner surface <b>22</b> of panel <b>24</b> may be coated with opaque frit layer <b>26</b> either in an area restricted to that for button stud <b>60</b>, i.e., slightly larger than the area of lower surface <b>62</b> of disk <b>60</b>, or is generally coated with the frit layer <b>26</b> as indicated by dash line <b>26</b>′ shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> and generally within central viewing area <b>27</b>. Lower surface <b>62</b> of disk <b>60</b> and frit layer coating <b>26</b> are preferably coated with the desired adhesion-promoting primer compound <b>50</b> as described above. The central portion of concave surface <b>62</b> of disk <b>60</b> is permanently bonded to fit layer <b>26</b> by adhesive <b>46</b> while the peripheral edge of surface <b>62</b> is temporarily fixtured to frit layer <b>26</b> by a thermoplastic hot-melt or other adhesive <b>48</b>. Moreover, permanent adhesive <b>46</b> mechanically bonds disk <b>60</b> to fit layer <b>26</b> by a portion of adhesive <b>46</b> extruded through holes or rotated lances <b>66</b>. In the case of rotated lances, extrusion of adhesive <b>46</b> is minimized by tab or vane <b>72</b> partially damming or restricting flow of adhesive <b>46</b> through each rotated lance <b>66</b>. Embossments or stand-offs <b>42</b> extending from lower surface <b>62</b> provide a space between panel surface <b>22</b> or fit layer <b>26</b> and disk <b>60</b>. Mounting stud or disk <b>60</b> is fitted with an appropriate latching or actuating mechanism or actuator <b>33</b>, <b>33</b> <i>a </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>8</b> and <b>8</b>A) which is attached to the inside of window opening <b>14</b> and which is used to actuate window assembly <b>12</b> between the open and closed positions via hinges <b>30</b>. Such actuators include overcenter hinges, as well as pneumatic and electric actuators <b>33</b>, or cable actuators <b>33</b> <i>a </i>as shown schematically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>8</b> and <b>8</b>A.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">In the alternative to centrally locating adhesive <b>46</b> between disk <b>60</b> and frit layer <b>26</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, thermoplastic adhesive <b>48</b> may be located below stud flange <b>74</b> while a bead of adhesive <b>46</b> is placed thereabout. Fixturing of disk <b>60</b> is still obtained by the thermoplastic hot-melt or other adhesive <b>48</b> located in a central portion of disk <b>60</b>, while the primary adhesive <b>46</b> is then forced outwardly toward the peripheral edges of disk <b>60</b> to provide the maximum bonding surface area. In yet another alternative, fixturing adhesive <b>48</b> may be omitted and both hinge <b>30</b> and mounting member <b>60</b> may be mechanically fixtured on panel <b>24</b> while the primary adhesive <b>46</b> cures. Examples of mechanical fixturing include gravity, mechanical locating, pressing or clamping including robotic, and manual locating, pressing or clamping.</p>
  <p num="p-0057">A preferred embodiment of the invention includes hinge <b>130</b>, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-15</figref>, made from 1.0 millimeter thick, 1010 cold-rolled, half-hardened, epoxy E-coated steel in a U-shape such that tab portion <b>138</b> overlies and is parallel to elongate flange portion <b>134</b>. It is preferred that the grain of the steel <b>156</b> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> be oriented generally perpendicular to the axis <b>158</b> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> of the arcuate, U-shaped bend. Leg <b>137</b> interconnecting flange <b>134</b> and tab <b>138</b> is arcuate to provide the spring-like hinge action. Flange <b>134</b> contains a plurality of holes <b>140</b> which are generally aligned along the longitudinal axis of the flange at equidistantly spaced intervals, preferably approximately 8.5 millimeters. Moreover, the preferred diameter of each hole <b>140</b> is about 3.0 millimeters.</p>
  <p num="p-0058">Flange <b>134</b> also contains embossments <b>142</b> which extend from lower surface <b>144</b> and serve to space flange <b>134</b> from panel inner surface <b>122</b>. Preferably, embossments <b>142</b> extend approximately 1 millimeter from flange <b>134</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the outer ends of flange <b>134</b> may curve slightly upwardly before attachment to panel <b>24</b>′. Such ends are pressed down against panel <b>24</b>′ when fixtured or secured to the panel. Flange <b>134</b> also includes a large hole <b>143</b> located directly opposite the portion of tab <b>138</b> which receives stud <b>152</b>. Hole <b>143</b> is provided to allow stud <b>152</b> to be placed through tab <b>138</b> so that stud head <b>153</b> can be welded or bonded to tab <b>138</b>. The opposite end of stud <b>152</b> extending from tab <b>138</b> is to be fastened to the vehicle as described below. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, hinge <b>130</b> is curved and preferably applied to panel <b>24</b>′ in a manner similar to that described for hinge <b>30</b> on panel <b>24</b>. Panel surface <b>22</b>′ preferably includes a primer <b>50</b>′ corresponding to primer <b>50</b> and adhesives <b>46</b>′, <b>48</b>′ may be used in the same manner as adhesives <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> for hinge <b>30</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">Window assembly <b>12</b> may also include a gasket <b>13</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 9</figref>) mounted to inner surface <b>22</b> or to pinch weld flange <b>56</b> to seal window assembly <b>12</b> in the window opening <b>14</b> when panel <b>24</b> is in the closed position. A variety of seals may be used including a bubble seal such as described in commonly-assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 957,417, filed Oct. 5, 1992, now issued as U.S. Pat.

No. 5,331,784, both of which are also incorporated herein by reference. These later two disclosures are more pertinent to fixed window assemblies than articulated window assemblies. Yet another sealing arrangement is disclosed in commonly-assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 027,078 filed Mar. 5, 1993, now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 5,544,458, also incorporated herein by reference.</p>
  <p num="p-0060">In manufacturing window assembly <b>12</b>, hinges <b>30</b>, <b>130</b> and disk <b>60</b> are preferably cleaned with isopropyl alcohol to remove any dirt and debris. The isopropyl alcohol is also used to clean the glass surface and/or frit coating <b>26</b> which will receive hinges <b>30</b>, <b>130</b> and disk <b>60</b>. After cleaning of the surfaces, panel surface <b>22</b> and/or frit coating <b>26</b> receive adhesion-promoting primer compound <b>50</b> which is then allowed to dry. Optionally, while adhesion-promoting primer compound <b>50</b> on panel <b>24</b> is drying, the appropriate primer <b>50</b> may also be applied to bottom surface <b>44</b> of hinges <b>30</b>, <b>130</b> and to lower surface <b>62</b> of disk <b>60</b> and allowed to dry.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">Primer <b>50</b> may be applied to hinges <b>30</b>, <b>130</b> and disk <b>60</b> in a variety of ways, including using a dauber, a wipe, spray or other applicator. In a preferred embodiment, primer <b>50</b> is applied to hinges <b>30</b>, <b>130</b> and disk <b>60</b> in one direction with a dauber wipe to obtain as uniform a coat as possible. If any bare spots appear after the initial cure time, another coat of primer <b>50</b> may be applied in the same direction. Automated systems such as robotic or conveyor systems may be used to carry out the application.</p>
  <p num="p-0062">Once primer <b>50</b> has dried, the preferred urethane adhesive <b>46</b> is applied in a bead to hinges <b>30</b>, <b>130</b> and disk <b>60</b>. For single-piece application, adhesive <b>46</b> may be applied using a glue gun, caulking gun or similar applicator. For multi-piece applications, robotic or conveyor applicators would be more appropriate. Sufficient room is provided on hinges <b>30</b>, <b>130</b> and disk <b>60</b> to receive the hot melt or thermoplastic fixturing adhesive <b>48</b> which may be applied using any of the above techniques.</p>
  <p num="p-0063">Soon after thermoplastic adhesive <b>48</b> is applied to mounting members <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>130</b>, they are located on and engaged with the surface <b>22</b> of panel <b>24</b> overlying the frit coating <b>26</b>. It is preferred that each mounting member <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>130</b> be temporarily held in place at least until thermoplastic fixturing adhesive <b>48</b> has set. If fixturing adhesive <b>48</b> is not used, mounting member <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>130</b> most likely will need to remain still relative to panel <b>24</b> for a longer period until bonding adhesive <b>46</b> cures. As mentioned above, this may be achieved by gravity, manual, or mechanical means. Bach panel assembly <b>12</b> is then placed in a chamber where the assemblies are preferably cured at a temperature of approximately 90° F. and a relative humidity greater than 85 percent. The holes extending through flange <b>34</b> of hinge <b>30</b>, and through disk <b>60</b> allow the moisture in the curing chamber to permeate adhesive <b>46</b> which results in a net decrease in curing time. It has been found that a cure time of about six hours for flanges without holes can be decreased to about four hours for flanges with holes. Following the cure time in the chamber, the finished panel assemblies <b>12</b> are then ready for shipment to the vehicle manufacturer.</p>
  <p num="p-0064">It is preferred that a moisture-activated urethane adhesive be used. Window panel assemblies manufactured using the moisture-activated Morton Yokohama WS70-FK urethane adhesive, and the Morton Yokohama MS-90 and RC-50 primers, resulted in bonds between the mounting members and panels which withstood straight pull test tensional load greater than 250 pounds, and a vast majority withstood loads greater than 300 pounds. In at least two instances, the bonds withstood tensional loads on the order of 400 pounds.</p>
  <p num="p-0065">Other test were conducted on the window assemblies which included thermal cycle tests, water immersion (80° C.) for 100 and 240 hours, vibration tests, CASS, and impact tests. In general, the bonds between the mounting members and panel withstood loads, on average, greater than 225 pounds while loads greater than 250 pounds were achieved on average for panels subjected to immersion in 80° C. water for 100 and 240 hours. Similar or better results were achieved on samples subjected to vibration, CASS and impact tests. Similar results can be achieved using the family or classes of adhesives described above.</p>
  <p num="p-0066">The above description is considered that of the preferred embodiments only. Modification of the invention will occur to those skilled in the art and to those who make or use the invention. Therefore, it is understood that the embodiments shown in the drawings and described above are merely for illustrative purposes and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention, which is defined by the following claims as interpreted according to the principles of patent law, including the doctrine of equivalents.</p>
