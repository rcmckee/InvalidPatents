    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>The present invention is generally directed to a system for authenticating signatures, such as autographs. More particularly, the invention is directed to a system for capturing an image of an individual signing an article, and a resulting product including the captured image and the signed article.</p>
    <p>2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p>Obtaining and collecting originally autographed or signed articles is increasingly popular, and an entire industry is now devoted to providing articles originally signed by notable individuals. Unfortunately, with the demand for originally signed and autographed articles being very high, and the supply of these unique, originally signed articles typically being quite limited, many unscrupulous attempts are made to forge the signatures of notable individuals, such as athletes, movie, television and media professionals, artists, and the like. These attempts are made easier by the advent of technologies that facilitate copying.</p>
    <p>While attempts to combat forgeries of autographs and signatures have been made, these attempts have enjoyed limited success and have numerous drawbacks and limitations. For example, a wide variety of equipment is available for electronically capturing a signature, so that the signature can be electronically compared with what is believed to be an actual signature of a particular individual. This type of authentication equipment, which typically utilizes an electronic pen and pad linked to a process, is expensive and often cumbersome to use. Additionally, signature-capturing devices of this type, while perhaps useful in a bank or other institutional setting, are impractical for autographs to be made on a wide variety of articles, such as clothing, posters, cards, artwork, sporting equipment, etc.</p>
    <p>More recently, autographed articles sold with a certificate of authenticity have gained popularity. With these products, the signed articles and the certificate of authenticity bear a common identification number, and the certificate of authenticity bears a signature of a witness in conjunction with a statement to the effect that he or she witnessed the signing of the associated article. As will be immediately recognized, the drawback to this approach is that an unscrupulous trader who forged the autograph of a notable individual would have no difficulty in forging a certificate of authenticity.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, the need exists for a simple, inexpensive and reliable method and system for authenticating signatures and autographs. The present invention fills these and other needs, while overcoming the drawbacks and limitations of prior approaches to authenticating a signature or autograph.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>In a preferred method of the present invention, an article to be signed (e.g. autographed) is presented to an individual whose autograph on the article is desired. The article to be signed is any desired article, such as clothing, a sporting item, a photograph or poster, a card, etc. As the individual signs the article, an image is captured, such that the captured image illustrates the actual original signing of the article by the particular individual.</p>
    <p>In accordance with the invention, the captured image is associated with the article so that a holder of the article can readily discern the authenticity of the autograph on the article. In one embodiment, the article to be signed is one of a numbered series and, additionally, bears a unique identification code. Preferably, the image captures the signing event, including particularly the number of the article being signed and its unique identification code.</p>
    <p>Particularly, an authentication system of the present invention has, in a preferred embodiment, one or more cameras for capturing an image of an individual signing an article. Preferably, the cameras capture a real-time recording (including video and audio) of the individual signing an article, although it should be understood that the invention encompasses still photos as well. With editing equipment, an operator may edit the captured image to include readable information, such as the series number of the signed article and/or the article's unique identification code. Additionally, pertinent information concerning the signed article may be placed on the image or video and/or stored in a memory in conjunction with the unique identification code associated with a particular article. For example, information stored in memory and/or included on the video or image may include the name of the signing party, the date and place signing occurred, the nature of the article, the series number of the article and the total number of articles in the series, and/or information concerning the initial purchaser or holder of the article.</p>
    <p>In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the authentication system is set up to capture images of an autograph session, during which a selected individual originally signs a number of articles. In such an arrangement as articles are signed by an individual, a real-time recording (preferably including audio and video) captures the individual signing the articles. The recording is edited such that a portion of the recording corresponding to a particular article contains information, readable upon playback of the recording, pertaining to the particular article shown in that portion of the recording. Thus, a holder of the particular signed article may view the recording and, in addition to viewing the signing of other articles signed during an autograph session, easily identify the signing of the particular article of interest.</p>
    <p>In accordance with the broad aspects of the present invention, an image of an individual signing an article is associated with the article to permit a holder of the article to verify the authenticity of the signature on the article. Thus, according to the invention, the photograph or recording of an individual signing an article may be presented to the holder of the article, either when the holder receives the signed article, or subsequently. In the case where a real-time recording of the signing event is captured, the holder of a particular signed article may be presented with a recording of the signing of that particular article only, or a recording of the signing of a plurality of articles signed during an autograph session, including particularly the signing of the article held by the holder.</p>
    <p>In an alternate embodiment, the association between the signed article and captured image is accomplished electronically. Particularly, an image (e.g., a still shot or real-time recording) of an individual signing an article is stored in memory in association with information indicative of, and/or pertaining to, the article. Thus, the holder of a signed article may access the memory, via a processor, such as through a communications network, and by inputting sufficient information associated with the article, view or download the captured image associated with the article.</p>
    <p>In accordance with the invention, in order for the holder of a signed article to be able to further confirm the authenticity of the signed article, the article preferably includes some unique identifying indicia (such as an identification code and/or series number). The indicia, when visibly present on the article, is also preferably visibly present in the image that is captured of the signing event. Alternatively, a display or signage located at the location of the signing event can be updated with unique identifying indicia for each article signed. In such a case, the image that is captured of the signing event preferably also captures the display or signage, so that the unique indicia associated with the signed article is visibly present on the captured image.</p>
    <p>As previously described, as an additional feature of the invention, the image of a signing event may be edited to itself include indicia thereon corresponding to the unique identifying indicia corresponding to the signed article that is captured in the image. Further still, the identifying indicia may also be placed on the storage medium for the recording.</p>
    <p>In accordance with yet a further aspect of the invention, additional information, pertaining to the signing individual's accomplishments, is stored in the memory (or on the storage medium for the image) and is associated with the data indicative of a signed article and/or the captured image thereof. Similarly, additional images of the individual, such as action images (not associated with the autograph event) may be stored and retrievable in conjunction with retrieval of information and images pertaining to a signing event. Thus, for example, an athlete's statistics and/or still-shots or real-time recordings of an athletic contest in which the athlete participated can be retrieved. Similarly, information and images corresponding to a movie or media professional or star may be stored and retrieved in conjunction with retrieval of information and images pertaining to a signing event.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, a bona fide purchaser or holder of the autographed article has a mechanism by which to subsequently authenticate the autograph, namely, by display of a photograph or by playback of the recording that captured the actual signing event.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>With initial reference to FIG. 1, a memorabilia kit of the present invention is denoted generally by reference numeral <b>10</b>. The memorabilia kit has a case <b>12</b>, including a base portion <b>14</b>, and a lid <b>16</b>. The base portion <b>14</b> forms a cavity, in which insert <b>18</b> is positioned. A signed article, denoted generally by reference numeral <b>20</b>, is positioned within the case <b>12</b> and, particularly, on top of the insert <b>18</b>. In the illustration shown, the article is preferably formed of paper or card stock, and is rectangular in configuration. The signed article is located under a transparent cover <b>22</b>, preferably formed of plastic or glass. The article <b>20</b> and cover <b>22</b> are held in place on the insert <b>18</b> by fasteners <b>24</b>.</p>
    <p>The signed article <b>20</b> has an originally signed signature, denoted generally by reference numeral <b>26</b>. For example, in the illustration of FIG. 1, an individual by the name of “John Doe” signed or autographed the article <b>20</b>, as evidenced by signature <b>26</b>. The signed article <b>20</b> also includes a series number denoted generally by reference numeral <b>28</b>, and printed onto the article, as well as a unique identification number, denoted generally by reference numeral <b>30</b>, also imprinted on the article <b>20</b>. In the illustration, the series number <b>28</b> of the particular signed article <b>20</b> is “#76”, and the unique identification number or code is “13A58”.</p>
    <p>The lid <b>16</b> has an interior surface <b>34</b>, and forms a recessed cavity, into which a storage media, denoted by reference numeral <b>36</b>, may be located. As illustrated, the storage media <b>36</b> is a compact disc (CD), or digital video disc (DVD), but it should be understood and appreciated that any form of storage medium may be utilized in conjunction with the principles of the present invention. The storage media <b>36</b> has a label <b>38</b>. Imprinted on the label <b>38</b> is the series number, denoted by reference numeral <b>28</b>, and the unique identification code, denoted by reference numeral <b>30</b>. In accordance with a unique aspect of the invention, and as described in greater detail below, storage media <b>36</b> has stored thereon a recording of the actual signing event that took place when the signator, namely “John Doe”, originally executed the 76th article of a series, as denoted by the signed article <b>20</b>. Accordingly, a purchaser or holder of memorabilia kit <b>10</b> has a mechanism by which to verify the authenticity of the signature of the individual signing the article <b>20</b>, namely, by playback of the real-time recording taken when the individual signed article <b>20</b>. As described in greater detail below, it is preferred that the recording includes both the appearance of the individual when signing the article <b>20</b>, as well as the series number and/or the unique identification code presented on the article. Additionally, as also described in greater detail below, it is preferred that the recording be edited to include readable information indicative of the particular article signed. The readable information is thus viewed upon playback of the recording, as illustrated in FIG. <b>4</b>.</p>
    <p>As illustrated, the memorabilia kit also preferably includes a writing utensil, such as an ink pen, denoted by reference numeral <b>32</b>. Particularly, insert <b>18</b> forms a recessed channel in which the writing utensil <b>32</b> rests. In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, and as described in greater detail below, the article <b>20</b>, which has been signed by a notable individual, namely “John Doe”, is preferably signed with the actual writing utensil <b>32</b> provided in memorabilia kit <b>10</b>. In this regard, and in accordance with an aspect of the invention, writing utensil <b>32</b> may also have indicia or data imprinted thereon representative of the name of the individual autographing the article <b>20</b> (e.g., “John Doe”), the series number associated with the article <b>20</b>, the unique object identification code associated with the article <b>20</b>, and possibly other information of interest, such as the date and location in which the signing took place, as well any particular affiliation a signator may have with a particular organization or event. For example, in the case where the notable individual autographing the article <b>20</b> is an athlete, names, logos, and illustrations associated with that athlete's team may be placed on the writing utensil <b>32</b>, the signed article <b>20</b>, the case <b>12</b>, and/or the label <b>38</b> of the storage media <b>36</b>.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, memorabilia kit <b>10</b> provides an originally signed article <b>20</b> with a storage media <b>36</b> which includes a recorded video of the actual signing event, to provide a mechanism by which to verify the authenticity of the signature. It should be understood and appreciated that the present invention is in no way limited to the preferred memorabilia kit illustrated and, in fact, the memorabilia kit <b>10</b> will vary widely in practice. For example, the particular articles signed or autographed by an individual will vary widely in accordance with the principles of the invention, and may include posters, photographs, artwork, clothing, sporting items, a label of any type, or any other conceivable article which could be signed or autographed. Accordingly, the case <b>12</b>, which provides a convenient housing for the particular article <b>20</b> illustrated in FIG. 1, may not always be practical.</p>
    <p>With reference now to FIG. 2, a block diagram of a preferred signature authentication system of the present invention is illustrated and described.</p>
    <p>A signature authentication system of the present invention includes a processor <b>40</b>. Connected to the processor <b>40</b> are first and second displays <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, respectively, an input <b>46</b>, such as a keyboard, a memory <b>48</b>, for storing editing software and other application software required by the authentication system, and a large capacity memory <b>50</b> for storing recorded audio and video signals. Additionally, a camera <b>52</b> is connected to processor <b>40</b>. As should be fully understood, more than one camera <b>52</b> can be utilized, if necessary, for capturing different angles and/or subject matter associated with the signing event of an article, as illustrated by the additional camera <b>52</b> <i>a </i>shown in broken lines.</p>
    <p>In accordance with the principles of the present invention, the authentication system is set up to capture a real-time video recording of an individual <b>52</b>, as he or she is originally signing or autographing the article <b>20</b> with the writing utensil <b>32</b>. Preferably, the camera <b>52</b> is positioned so as to capture a sufficient amount of individual <b>52</b> to make the identity of the individual evident. Additionally, the recording preferably captures the article <b>20</b>, the hand of the individual, the writing utensil <b>32</b> while signing is taking place, and other unique aspects of the article <b>20</b>, such as the series number and identification code. In this way, a holder of the signed article <b>20</b> has, in conjunction with the recording, a mechanism by which to confirm the authenticity of the signed article with a high degree of certainty. As necessary, one or more additional cameras, such as camera <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, can be positioned to capture close ups of the individual or, as illustrated, the article <b>20</b>, the hand of the individual, and the writing utensil during signing of the article <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p>As will be appreciated, the hardware displayed in FIG. 2 can take the form of any conventional video recording and editing equipment. In this regard, it should be understood that the present invention is not limited to the specific hardware illustrated, but rather that the hardware illustrated in FIG. 2 is representative of one preferred embodiment of the invention for recording video (and associated audio) associated with the signing of an article <b>20</b>. In this regard, camera <b>52</b> may utilize an analog platform or digital platform. Known analog platforms include, but are not necessarily limited to, VHS, SVHS, HI-8, ¾ inch, and BETA CAM. As desired, camera <b>52</b> can be an electronic news camera, often referred to as an ENG camera, with one or more video decks built directly into the camera. Alternatively, camera <b>52</b> can utilize a digital platform, such as a digital BETA CAM, or a DV video camera.</p>
    <p>In the embodiment shown, camera <b>52</b> is preferably of a type which utilizes a digital format and sends a signal representative of that which is being recorded to processor <b>40</b> for storage in the large capacity memory <b>50</b>. The software for editing the data stored in the large capacity memory <b>50</b> is stored in memory <b>48</b>, and can be utilized by processor <b>40</b>, upon control of an operator through the input <b>46</b> to edit the data as desired. As will be readily understood and appreciated, the system preferably employs first and second displays <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, thus permitting an operator, during editing functions, to display both a raw recording, as well as edited content, and to permit the operator to more easily make editing selections.</p>
    <p>Although the preferred embodiment of the present invention employs a video camera <b>52</b> for capturing and recording real time video of the individual <b>52</b> signing article <b>20</b>, in an alternate embodiment of the present invention, camera <b>52</b> is of a type for taking still shots of the individual <b>52</b> when signing article <b>20</b>. In such an embodiment, it is still preferred that the image captured by camera <b>52</b> captures enough subject matter to permit a holder of the photograph that is taken to easily and quickly confirm that the individual <b>52</b> is signing a particular article <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p>With additional reference to FIG. 3, a method of the present invention and, particularly, a method for capturing or recording an image of the individual signing an article is illustrated and described.</p>
    <p>During utilization of the authentication system illustrated in FIG. 2, an operator records an autograph session in accordance with the preferred principles of the present invention, as denoted generally at step <b>60</b> of FIG. <b>3</b>. In the preferred embodiment in which the camera <b>52</b> captures a real time video, recording of the autograph session is accomplished by camera <b>52</b> generating a signal that is sent to processor <b>40</b> and stored in large capacity memory <b>50</b>. In accordance with the principles of the present invention, audio may be simultaneously recorded. As indicated at step <b>62</b> of FIG. 3, a time code according to the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, often referred to as a SMPTE Code, is placed on the audio tract of the recording. Particularly, a unique identifier, as part of the SMPTE Code, is placed on each frame of the video, so that each frame has its own unique signature. As will be understood and appreciated, the code and audio code, and is machine readable by a converter, or, in the system illustrated, processor <b>40</b> which includes the necessary functions and features to read the SMPTE time code.</p>
    <p>As illustrated at optional step <b>64</b>, the recording captured by camera <b>52</b> may be edited by an operator utilizing input <b>46</b> to access and contact editing software stored in memory <b>48</b>. FIG. 3 illustrates the editing steps in dashed lines to indicate that it is an optional step, and that, if desired, the operator can choose to avoid editing the raw video data collected. As will be understood, the video recording can be edited as desired to make for a more presentable appearance. Those with skill in the art will recognize that an operator typically accomplishes video editing by generating a decision list which controls the selection of frames to be included in, or taken out of, a final version of the recording. Once the decision list is created, a master list may be generated for the purpose of assembling a master, finally edited recording. The actual editing that takes place with respect to the real time video captured during an autograph session will obviously vary depending upon the circumstances. However, in accordance with an aspect of the invention, it is preferred that, at a minimum, an operator edit the recording to burn onto the storage media upon which the video recording is stored, an identification code associated with the signing event taking place. In this regard, the identification code electronically burned onto one or more frames of the video recording associated with the particular signing event may be the SMPTE time code utilized in conjunction with the audio tract. Additionally, or alternatively, the video recording can be edited, by the electronic “window burning” described, or by other editing techniques, to present, upon playback of the recording, the unique identification code <b>30</b> placed on the actual article <b>20</b> being signed. Additionally, the video recording is preferably edited in a similar manner to include on the recording, for viewing for playback of the recording, the actual series number of the article being signed. Accordingly, as illustrated in FIG. 4, upon playback of the recording of the individual <b>52</b> originally signing the article <b>20</b>, the number of the series (“#76”), and the unique identification code <b>30</b> associated with the article <b>20</b>, and appearing on the article <b>20</b>, are also displayed on the video playback. As a result of these additional unique features, it become very difficult, if not impossible, to fraudulently copy and disseminate a non-authentic article.</p>
    <p>In accordance with typical procedures of an autograph session, an individual, such as individual <b>52</b>, signs in rapid succession a number of articles in a series of articles. Accordingly, in accordance with one method of the present invention, the entire autograph session is captured by a real time video recording with camera <b>52</b>, and stored in large capacity memory <b>50</b>. As will be understood in view of the foregoing, any editing can include editing those frames of the video associated with the signing of a particular numbered article to include information pertaining to that article, such as the series number and/or a unique identification code associated with that signed article. Thus, upon playback of the entire video, as the individual <b>52</b> is shown signing a number of articles, information will be provided to the viewer in the form of data indicative of the number in the series, and/or the unique identification code.</p>
    <p>As illustrated at step <b>66</b> of FIG. 3, once the video recording is captured, and edited as desired, the recording is preferably duplicated. Particularly, the number of duplicates generated is consistent with the number of articles signed during the autograph session. As indicated at step <b>68</b>, each duplicate is assigned an identification code corresponding to the autographed article, and, as previously described, that identification code is located on the label, preferably along with the series number of the article, as illustrated in FIG. <b>1</b>. Additionally, and in accordance with an important aspect of the invention, a data base is maintained in memory <b>48</b> for storing pertinent information pertaining to the autograph session, including the recorded image, the name of the individual <b>52</b> signing the articles, the number and nature of the articles signed, the date and location of the signing, and the unique identification code associated with each article. Accordingly, as a further authenticity and verification feature of the present invention, a holder of the originally signed articles <b>20</b> can access the central data base, to confirm details of the actual signing event of the particular article he or she is holding. Thus, for example, the holder of an originally signed article, bearing either a unique identification code, or a series number, or both, may access the central data base, such as could be made available through a communications network, and enter information he or she has available pertaining to the article he or she is holding. By accessing the data base, the operator may retrieve information which will include any of the information stored in the data base. Particularly, the user may retrieve and view the real-time recording and all related information associated with the information input by the user. Alternatively, in the embodiment in which the image of the signing event is a still photo, the still photo of the signing event associated with the particular article held by the user can be retrieved.</p>
    <p>As indicated at step <b>70</b> of FIG. 3, each duplicate, and particularly the storage medium upon which the duplicate recording is stored, is labeled. As illustrated in FIG. 1, the label <b>38</b> of the storage medium <b>36</b> preferably includes indicia indicative of the number of the series of the particular article signed, and the unique identification code of the particular article signed. Accordingly, as used herein, associating an image of an individual signing an article with the signed article encompasses placing the image in proximity to the article, such as in case <b>12</b>, and/or associating an image of the signing event with the article by making the image available electronically, whether from a storage medium provided to the holder of the article, or from a remote data base, and/or associating the article and image by applying a common, unique identifier to each.</p>
    <p>With additional reference to FIG. 4, playback of a real time recording of an autograph session captured according to the principles of the present invention is illustrated. As illustrated, playback of the recording permits viewing of the individual <b>52</b> when actually signing the article <b>20</b>, and furthermore includes readable information pertaining to the series number (“#76”), and the unique identification code for the signed article. Accordingly, as illustrated in FIG. 4, the series number and unique identification code are provided on the video recording and viewed upon playback, are located on the signed article <b>20</b>, and are also located on the label <b>38</b> of the storage medium <b>36</b>. Again, as will be understood and appreciated, it is preferred that both the series number and the identification code are provided, although neither or only one of these may be placed on the various components. For example, authentication can occur by virtue only of the fact that a real time video of the individual signing the article is available, and that it is possible to ascertain from the real time video that the particular article in question is the article being signed on the video. The addition of a series number and unique identification code, not only on the article signed, but located in machine readable form on the recording, and on any label utilized on the storage medium, make forgeries all the more difficult, if not impossible.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, the present invention provides a unique memorabilia kit, and a system and method for authenticating originally signed articles. In addition to the foregoing, additional data associated with the particular individual signing an article can be stored in memory <b>48</b>, and associated with the recording of the signing event. For example, an athlete's statistics, real time video recordings of an athlete, can be associated with the signed article and/or the recording of the signing event and provided on the storage medium associated with the article, or provided in a data base for viewing from a remote location. As another example, when the individual signing the article is a movie star, information pertaining to that individual stored in association with the recording of the signing event, or the article signed, and real time video clips of movies or dramas in which the individual appeared can be provided.</p>
    <p>From the foregoing it will be seen that this invention is one well adapted to attain all ends and objects hereinabove set forth together with the other advantages which are obvious and which are inherent to the structure.</p>
    <p>It will be understood that certain features and subcombinations are of utility and may be employed without reference to other features and subcombinations. This is contemplated by and is within the scope of the claims.</p>
