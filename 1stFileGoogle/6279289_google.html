In each embodiment, the framing system includes a base, which may be attached to a foundation of the structure by conventional means, which preferably comprises at least one rectangular or square metal tube. Alternatively, the base may be made of other metal structures. The framing system further includes a plurality of lower connecting members attached to and extending upwardly from the base and a plurality of upwardly extending support members which are interconnected to the lower connecting members. The framing system may further include an upper member and a plurality of upper connecting members attached to and extending downwardly from the upper member. Each of the support members is also interconnected to one of the upper connecting members, which is aligned with one of the lower connecting members. The interconnections between the support members and the corresponding lower and upper connecting members may be achieved by various alternative configurations, but in each case one member has a reduced end portion which is inserted into a non-reduced end portion of the adjacent member. The reduced end portion is preferably achieved by a roll reduction process.</div>

    <heading>CROSS REFERENCES</heading> <p>The subject Application claims the priority benefits of U.S. Provisional Patent Application having Ser. No. 60/040,835 filed on Mar. 19, 1997, entitled “Tool for Swaging Metal Tubing, and Integral Tubular Framing System Incorporating Swaged Metal Tubing.”</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading> <p>1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>The present invention relates generally to framing systems used in the construction of buildings, and more particularly to a metal framing system which incorporates hollow metal tubing.</p>
    <p>2. Related Art</p>
    <p>Known framing systems used in the construction industry are typically made of either wood or metal, with wood framing systems being the most common. As is well known, wood framing systems have enjoyed widespread use, for instance in the construction of residential homes. Wood frames are typically constructed by connecting pieces of wood, such as 2×4's or 2×6's, with nails in a form that creates either the interior or exterior outline of a structure, or both. In known wood framing systems, all major components are typically made of wood, including components which may be referred to in the art as the bottom plate, studs, top plate and roof trusses. With the exception of roof trusses, which utilize miter cuts on the ends of adjacent pieces of wood to accomplish the desired angular relationship between adjacent members, most wood framing systems consist primarily of straight 2×4's nailed together to define the outside and inside areas of the structure and to provide the load bearing support.</p>
    <p>Although wood framing systems have enjoyed widespread use, they are subject to several disadvantages. For instance, the process of constructing a wood framing system is relatively slow since all joints within the system are typically connected with several nails. For example, even if the included roof trusses are pre-assembled, it typically takes a framing crew of four people between five and seven working days to frame a 1,500 square foot house.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the quality of the workmanship associated with the construction of wood framing is often poor, especially in conjunction with low and moderate priced housing where builder's profit margins are relatively low and building costs are suppressed as much as possible. The primary result of this poor workmanship is typically the lack of squareness in the structure frame which adversely affects the installation of other components in the structure.</p>
    <p>Other disadvantages associated with wood framing is the flammability of wood, and the potential for deterioration due to exposure to weather or insects such as termites or carpenter ants. Another disadvantage is that the system strength may be reduced at angled connections which require a miter cut and attachment with either nails or screws. Yet another disadvantage associated with use of wood framing systems is the depletion of wood as a natural resource.</p>
    <p>Although metal framing systems may represent an improvement relative to wood framing systems with regard to improved strength and reduced deterioration, known metal framing systems are also typically subject to one or more disadvantages. For instance, like a wood framing system, the assembly of a metal framing system may be very time consuming since the metal framing system may require nearly as many metal screws as the nails used in a comparable wood framing system to connect adjacent metal components. Moreover, the screws are generally not as quickly inserted as nails, and therefore the metal framed structure may actually require more time to assemble than a comparable wood framed structure. These and other disadvantages associated with metal framing systems may be further illustrated by the following discussion of known metal framing systems.</p>
    <p>Metal framing systems have been used for some time in commercial construction and have recently become more popular in residential construction. Known metal framing systems used in these applications commonly include metal components which are formed as three-sided channels, such as U-channels. For instance, these systems may include vertically extending metal channels, which are inserted into the open side of horizontally extending metal channels used for the bottom and top members of the metal framing system. The joints between the vertically and horizontally extending members are typically secured with numerous fasteners such as screws. Additionally, metal straps are often utilized to secure the vertically extending channel members to one another. Accordingly, the assembly of a metal framing system of this type may be very time consuming due to the requirement to secure the numerous fasteners and metal straps.</p>
    <p>Another known metal framing system, which is used to frame a carport, utilizes round hollow tubing with one end of each of the round tubing members being inserted into the hollow end of an adjacent round tubing member. The joint between the two round tubing members may then be stabilized with conventional fasteners. The male portion of each joint may be accomplished by a swaging process to reduce an end portion of the corresponding round tubing member. Although the foregoing carport framing system has been advantageously utilized, use of round metal tubing makes it difficult to insert fasteners into the tubing joints which complicates the assembly of the framing system. Furthermore, in some applications, such as when the carport is placed adjacent to a residential structure, the carport frame may not be viewed as aesthetically appealing.</p>
    <p>It is often more advantageous to use either square or rectangular metal tubing in certain applications. However, the connection of adjacent components of square or rectangular metal tubing has been subject to the following problems. Known methods of reducing square and rectangular metal tubing include those which utilize one or more dies. With this form of reduction, one end of the square or rectangular tube is crushed by the force created by various configurations of press equipment, with the size of the reduction being determined by the die design. This method of end reduction of square and rectangular metal tubing is subject to the following disadvantages. In the first instance, the end reduction of the tubing may require several “hits” or applications of the press equipment to achieve the desired reduction, with each application adding to the manufacturing cost. Furthermore, the crushing force of the press equipment may cause excessive and/or non-uniform deformation of the tube end. More specifically, one or more sides of the tubing may become concave, thereby reducing the overall strength of the tube and detracting from the smoothness of the transition between the original shape and the reduced end. In certain instances, the excessive and/or non-uniform deformation may be so severe that the reduced end of the tube is not capable of insertion into a tube of the same size prior to reduction, as intended.</p>
    <p>Due to the foregoing problems associated with the use of dies to end reduce square and rectangular tubing, connections of adjacent lengths of like-sized square and rectangular metal tubing has generally been accomplished by inserting a smaller tube, of the same shape, inside two adjacent like-sized pieces of rectangular or square metal tubing, and then securing the joint by fastening each section of the outer tubes to the inner tube. Framing systems of this type have been used to frame carports. The inner tube, as well as the required fasteners, add to the cost of this method of joining adjacent sections of square or rectangular metal tubing. Another disadvantage associated with this type of metal framing system is that the strength of the included joints may be be limited to the strength of the required fasteners at each joint.</p>
    <p>In view of the foregoing disadvantages associated with known wood and metal framing systems, there is a continuing need for improved framing systems for use in the construction of a wide variety of buildings including residential and commercial structures.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY</heading> <p>In view of the foregoing needs, the present invention is directed to a simple, cost effective and efficient system and method for framing at least a portion of a wide variety of structures including, but not limited to the following structures: residential homes; carports; commercial buildings such as office, retail, mini-storage and industrial buildings; apartment and condominium buildings; office build-out and commercial buildings; utility buildings; and modular/kiosk structures. The framing system and method of the present invention utilizes either rectangular or square metal tubing, or a combination thereof, and therefore has several advantages over existing wood framing systems or metal framing systems utilizing components other than rectangular or square metal tubing. For instance, due to the use of rectangular or square metal tubing, systems embodying the principles of the present invention exhibit improved mechanical strength relative to similar wood framing systems or various metal framing systems such as those which utilize open channel members.</p>
    <p>The ease of assembling various components of the framing system of the present invention allows a significant reduction in time, and therefore of cost, in framing various structures relative to prior wood or metal framing systems. For instance, the speed of assembly and therefore the reduction in cost associated with the apparatus and method of the present invention is accomplished by interconnecting various components of the framing system by inserting a reduced end portion of one member or component into an adjacent component which is constructed of a like-sized and similarly shaped metal tube, i.e., either rectangular or square, which has not been end reduced. As an example of the time and cost reductions which may be realized using a framing system embodying the principles of the present invention, a 1,500 square foot house may be framed in less than one day using a crew of four people whereas it typically takes a similar sized crew between five and seven working days to frame a similar structure using wood.</p>
    <p>The various components of the framing system of the present invention may be manufactured in a plant setting where relatively stringent quality control measures may be applied, resulting in improved workmanship relative to a comparable wood framed structure. More particularly, the squareness of the frame may be significantly improved relative to the squareness of a comparable wood framed structure, which is often less than desirable, especially in low and moderate priced housing where builder's margins are relatively low and costs are typically suppressed as much as possible.</p>
    <p>The rectangular and square metal tubes incorporated in the framing systems of the present invention have four sides and a welded seam. Assuming similar size and wall thickness, these metal tubes are significantly stronger than the three-sided metal channels used in many known metal framing systems. Also, as compared to a wood stud, similar sized metal tubing is significantly stronger. Additionally, the four sides of the rectangular and square metal tubes provide flat surfaces which facilitate the attachment of other structures to the framing system.</p>
    <p>Another advantage of the framing system of the present invention, at least with respect to prior wood framing systems, is that the metal framing system of the present invention is not subject to deterioration from insects, rotting or warping. Furthermore, the metal framing system of the present invention is not flammable.</p>
    <p>According to a first aspect of the present invention, a system is provided for framing at least a portion of a structure which may include a foundation. According to a preferred embodiment, the system includes a base which may be attached to the foundation of the structure, and a plurality of lower connecting members attached to the base and extending upwardly therefrom. Each of the lower connecting members comprises a metal tube selected from the group consisting of rectangular metal tubes and square metal tubes. The system further includes a plurality of upwardly extending support members which also comprise a metal tube selected from the group consisting of rectangular metal tubes and square metal tubes. A plurality of lower joints interconnect the support members and lower connecting members with each of the lower joints interconnecting one of the support members and one of the lower connecting members. The support members have a cross-sectional shape which is substantially the same as the cross-sectional shape of the interconnected one of the lower connecting members. For instance, if the lower connecting member comprises a rectangular metal tube, then the corresponding, interconnected one of the support members also comprises a rectangular metal tube. For each of the lower joints, either the support member or the lower connecting member has a reduced end portion which is inserted into the other of the support member and interconnected one of the lower connecting members.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment the reduced end portion, which corresponds to the male portion of the lower joint, comprises the lower end portion of the corresponding support member which is inserted into the interconnected one of the lower connecting members. This may apply to at least a portion of the lower joints. In another embodiment, the reduced end portion comprises an upper portion of the corresponding lower connecting member which is inserted into the interconnected one of the support members, for each one of at least a portion of the lower joints.</p>
    <p>The system may further include an upper member, which may be substantially horizontally extending or may alternatively be sloped relative to horizontal. The upper member preferably comprises either a rectangular metal tube or a square metal tube, with the selection depending upon the cross-sectional shape of the support members included in the framing system. A plurality of upper connecting members are attached to the upper member and extend downwardly therefrom, with each of the upper connecting members comprising a metal tube selected from the group consisting of rectangular metal tubes and square metal tubes.</p>
    <p>A plurality of upper joints interconnects the upwardly extending support members and the upper connecting members with each of the upper joints interconnecting one of the support members and one of the upper connecting members. The cross-sectional shape of each of the support members matches the cross-sectional shape of the interconnected one of the upper connecting members. For each of the upper joints, either the support member or the upper connecting member has a reduced end portion which is inserted into the other member. In one embodiment, the reduced end portion of each one of at least a portion of the upper joints comprises the upper end portion of the corresponding one of the support members, with the upper end portion being inserted into the corresponding, interconnected one of the upper connecting members. In another embodiment, the reduced end portion of each one of at least a portion of the upper joints comprises a lower end portion of the corresponding one of the upper connecting members, which is attached to the upper member at an upper end portion thereof, with the lower end portion of the upper connecting member being inserted into the corresponding, interconnected one of the support members.</p>
    <p>The reduced end portion of each of the upper and lower joints is preferably formed by a roll reduction process, in which the end of the corresponding rectangular or square metal tube to be reduced is inserted into a tool having a plurality of rollers which are configured and arranged to accomplish the desired end reduction of the tube. This process is disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/957,354.</p>
    <p>According to another embodiment, a system is provided for framing at least a portion of a structure having a foundation, such as a residential home. The system comprises a plurality of exterior wall frames interconnected to one another and extending upwardly from the foundation of the structure. Each of the wall frames includes a base attached to the foundation, a plurality of lower connecting members attached to the base and extending upwardly therefrom, and a plurality of upwardly extending support members, with each being interconnected to one of the lower connecting members by one of a plurality of lower joints. Each of the lower connecting members and each of the support members comprises a rectangular metal tube. For each of the lower joints, either the support member or the lower connecting member has a reduced end portion which is inserted into the other member.</p>
    <p>Each of the wall frames further includes an upper member comprising a rectangular metal tube and a plurality of upper connecting members attached to the upper member and extending downwardly therefrom. Each of the upper connecting members also comprises a rectangular metal tube and is aligned with one of the lower connecting members. A plurality of upper joints interconnects the support members and the upper connecting members, with each of the upper joints interconnecting one of the support members and one of the upper connecting members. Each of the support members extends between one of the lower connecting members and the aligned one of the upper connecting members. For each of the upper joints, either the support member or the upper connecting member has a reduced end portion which is inserted into the other member. Similar to the previously discussed embodiment, the reduced end portion of each of the lower and upper joints is preferably formed by a roll reduction process.</p>
    <p>At least one of the exterior wall frames may further include a window frame disposed between and interconnected to the base and the upper member. The window frame may be connected to the base via a second plurality of lower connecting members attached to the base and extending upwardly therefrom, a plurality of lower window frame connecting members attached to and extending downwardly from the window frame, and a second plurality of upwardly extending support members. Each one of the support members extends between and is connected to one of the second plurality of lower connecting members and an aligned one of the lower window frame connecting members. The joints between each support member and the corresponding one of the lower window frame connecting members and the second plurality of lower connecting member is preferably configured as described previously, i.e., a reduced end portion of one member is inserted into the corresponding adjacent member. The window frame may be connected to the upper member in a similar fashion.</p>
    <p>The system may further include an interior wall frame attached to and extending inwardly from one of the exterior wall fires. The interior wall frame may include a base attached to the foundation of the structure, a plurality of lower connecting members attached to and extending upwardly from the base, an upper member spaced apart from the base and a plurality of upper connecting members attached to and extending downwardly from the upper member. The interior wall frame further includes a plurality of upwardly extending members, with each one extending between and connected to one of the lower connecting members and an aligned one of the upper connecting members.</p>
    <p>According to another embodiment, a system is provided for framing a structure which may comprise a carport. The system includes first and second bases which are laterally spaced apart from one another. First and second pluralities of lower connecting members are attached to the first and second bases, respectively, and extend upwardly therefrom. A plurality of first side posts are interconnected to the first plurality of lower connecting members via a first plurality of lower joints and a plurality of second side posts are interconnected to the second plurality of lower connecting members, via a second plurality of lower joints. Each of the lower connecting members and side posts comprises a metal tube selected from the group consisting of rectangular metal tubes and square metal tubes. Each side post and the corresponding one of the lower connecting members is interconnected via the corresponding lower joint, in the fashion discussed with respect to previous embodiments. The system further includes a plurality of bridge members, with each of the bridge members extending between and interconnecting one of the first side posts and one of the second side posts.</p>
    <p>According to a second aspect of the present invention, a method of constructing a framing system is provided for use in framing at least a portion of a structure. The method comprises the steps of providing a base made of metal, making each of a plurality of lower connecting members from a four-sided metal tube, and attaching each one of the lower connecting members to the base. The method further includes the steps of making each one of a plurality of support members from a four-sided metal tube and interconnecting each of the support members to one of the lower connecting members so that each of the support members extends upwardly from the interconnected one of the lower connecting members.</p>
    <p>The step of interconnecting comprises the steps of forming a reduced end portion on one of the support member and the lower connecting member for each interconnected pair of the support members and the lower connecting members, and inserting the reduced end portion into the other member. The step of forming may comprise the step of roll reducing one end of either the support member or the lower connecting member for each interconnected pair of the support members and the lower connecting members.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading> <p>Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals have been used for similar elements throughout, FIG. 1 is an elevation view illustrating a framing system <b>10</b>, according to a first embodiment of the present invention. The framing system <b>10</b> may be used to frame either an exterior or an interior wall for a wide variety of structures including, but not limited to the following structures: residential homes; carports; commercial buildings such as office, retail, mini-storage and industrial buildings; apartment and condominium buildings; office build-out and commercial buildings; utility buildings; and modular/ kiosk structures. The framing system <b>10</b> may be attached to a concrete support structure <b>12</b> which may comprise a concrete slab or a portion of a poured concrete foundation. Alternatively, the framing system may be attached to other conventional foundation or support structures. As yet another alternative, in certain applications, the framing system may rest upon a ground surface.</p>
    <p>The framing system <b>10</b> includes a base <b>14</b>, which is attached to the concrete support structure <b>12</b> by conventional means as subsequently discussed in greater detail. Base <b>14</b> is preferably made from either rectangular metal tubing or square metal tubing but may alternatively be made from other metal structures such as metal plates, metal channel sections, and angled metal sections. Additionally, base <b>14</b> may be made as either a unitary or one piece construction, or alternatively may be made from a plurality of the foregoing metal components, such as rectangular or square metal tubing, which are attached to one another. In the illustrative embodiments shown in FIGS. 1-8, base <b>14</b> is made from a single section of rectangular metal tubing.</p>
    <p>As used herein, the term “rectangular metal tubing” refers to hollow metal tubing having a substantially rectangular cross-sectional shape and the term “square metal tubing” refers to hollow metal tubing having a substantially square cross-sectional shape. The rectangular and square metal tubing incorporated in the various embodiments of the framing system of the present invention may be made of steel or aluminum or any other metal or metal alloy which is suitable for use in constructing a system for use in framing a wide variety of structures including, but not limited to those mentioned previously with respect to framing system <b>10</b>. It is a further requirement with respect to certain components of the various framing systems of the present invention which require an end reduction, that the metal selected to construct the component must be compatible with achieving the end reduction via a roll reduction process as disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/957,354.</p>
    <p>Framing system <b>10</b> further includes a plurality of lower connecting members <b>16</b> which are preferably made from either rectangular or square metal tubing and are attached to the base <b>14</b> by conventional means, such as welding. As shown in FIG. 1, the lower connecting members <b>16</b> are spaced apart from one another along base <b>14</b>, with the particular spacing depending upon the application of system <b>10</b>. For instance, if the framing system <b>10</b> is used to frame the wall of a residential structure, the lower connecting members <b>16</b> may be advantageously spaced either 16 or 24 inches from one another due to the common use of this spacing in wood framed residential structures. However, it should be understood that other spacings may be utilized in residential home applications.</p>
    <p>The framing system <b>10</b> further includes a plurality of upwardly extending support members <b>18</b>, which may be referred to as studs depending upon the particular application of system <b>10</b>. Each of the support members <b>18</b> is made from either a rectangular metal tube or a square metal tube and is interconnected to one of the lower connecting members <b>16</b> via one of a plurality of lower joints <b>20</b> as discussed further in conjunction with FIG. <b>2</b>. The cross-sectional shape of each support member <b>18</b> must match the cross-sectional shape of the corresponding or interconnected one of the lower connecting members <b>16</b>. Accordingly, if a particular lower connecting member <b>16</b> is made from a rectangular metal tube, then the interconnected one of the support members <b>18</b> must also be made from a rectangular metal tube. Similarly, if a particular lower connecting member <b>16</b> is made from a square metal tube, then the interconnected one of the support members <b>18</b> must also be made from a square metal tube. The support members <b>18</b> extend upwardly from the lower connecting members <b>16</b> and, in one preferred embodiment, are substantially vertically extending.</p>
    <p>In the illustrative embodiment, the framing system <b>10</b> further includes an upper member <b>22</b> which is made from at least one rectangular or square metal tube. In the illustrative embodiment, the upper member <b>22</b> is made from a single rectangular metal tube, but alternatively may be constructed from a plurality of rectangular metal tubes which may be attached to one another. In other embodiments, when the support members <b>18</b> are made from square metal tubes, the upper member <b>22</b> may be made from either a single square metal tube or a plurality of square metal tubes. In other embodiments the upper member <b>22</b> may be made of other metal components such as metal plates, metal channel sections, and angled metal sections.</p>
    <p>System <b>10</b> further includes a plurality of upper connecting members <b>24</b> which are attached to and extend downwardly from the upper member <b>22</b>. The upper connecting members <b>24</b> are made from either rectangular or square metal tubes, with the chosen configuration depending upon the shape of the corresponding support member <b>18</b> and lower connecting member <b>16</b>. For instance, if both the corresponding lower connecting member <b>16</b> and support member <b>18</b> are made from rectangular metal tubing, then the upper connecting member <b>24</b> must also be made from rectangular metal tubing, as shown in FIG. <b>2</b>. The upper connecting members <b>24</b> are attached to the upper member <b>22</b> by conventional means, such as welding. Each of the support members <b>18</b> is interconnected to one of the upper connecting members <b>24</b> via one of a plurality of upper joints <b>26</b>. Each of the upper connecting members <b>24</b> is positioned on the upper member <b>22</b> so that it is aligned with one of the lower connecting members <b>16</b>. Each of the support members or studs <b>18</b> extends between one of the lower connecting members <b>16</b> and the aligned one of the upper connecting members <b>24</b> as shown in FIG. <b>1</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 2, each of the support members <b>18</b> includes a lower end portion <b>28</b>, an upper end portion <b>30</b> and an intermediate portion <b>32</b> which extends between and is integral with the lower <b>28</b> and upper <b>30</b> end portions. The lower <b>28</b> and upper <b>30</b> end portions and intermediate portion <b>32</b> are preferably made as a one-piece construction. As shown in FIG. 2, the lower <b>28</b> and upper <b>30</b> end portions comprise reduced end portions of support member <b>18</b> and have a rectangular cross-sectional shape which is reduced in size relative to the rectangular cross-sectional shape of the intermediate portion <b>32</b> of the corresponding support member <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p>The reduced, lower end portion <b>28</b> of each support member <b>18</b> is inserted into the corresponding lower connecting member <b>16</b> which has a rectangular cross-sectional shape which may be the same size as that of the intermediate portion <b>32</b> of the support member <b>18</b>. In this instance, the reduced, lower end portion <b>28</b> comprises the male portion of the corresponding lower joint <b>20</b>, while the lower connecting member <b>16</b> comprises the female portion of the corresponding lower joint <b>20</b>. The reduced end portion <b>28</b> and lower connecting member <b>16</b> are preferably sized so that they engage one another in a snug fit. Similarly, the reduced, upper end portion <b>30</b> of each support member <b>18</b> is inserted into the corresponding one of the upper connecting members <b>24</b>. Accordingly, the upper end portion <b>30</b> of each support member <b>18</b> comprises the male portion of the corresponding upper joint <b>26</b>, while the interconnected one of the upper connecting members <b>24</b> comprises the female portion of the corresponding joint <b>26</b>.</p>
    <p>The reduced end portions <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> of each support member <b>18</b> are preferably formed by a process which may be referred to as a roll reduction process. As used herein, the term “roll reduction process” is intended to refer to reducing an end portion of either a square or rectangular metal tube by inserting the tube into a tool which incorporates a plurality of rollers which are configured and arranged to achieve the desired end reduction in the tube. More specifically, as used herein, the term “roll reduction process” is intended to refer to achieving the desired end reduction in either a square or rectangular metal tube by utilizing a tool such as tool <b>10</b> or tool <b>100</b> which are disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application having Ser. No. 08/957,354 entitled “Tool for Working Shaped, Hollow Metal Tubing to Achieve an End Reduction”, which is expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. As shown in application Ser. No. 08/957,354 an end reduction of a square metal tube may be achieved by using tool <b>10</b>, while an end reduction of a rectangular metal tube may be achieved by using tool <b>100</b>. For further information regarding the structural features of the tools disclosed and the manner in which an end reduction of a square or rectangular metal tube is achieved, the reader is referred to application Ser. No. 08/957,354.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIGS. 3 and 4 it may be seen that the longitudinal lengths of the lower connecting members <b>16</b> and the reduced, lower end portions <b>28</b> of the support members <b>18</b> may be sized to achieve somewhat different results. For instance, as shown in FIG. 3, the longitudinal length of the lower end portion <b>28</b> is greater than that of the corresponding lower connecting member <b>16</b> so that the lower end portion <b>28</b> extends upwardly above the upper edge <b>34</b> of the corresponding lower connecting member <b>16</b>. As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, each of the support members <b>18</b> may include a lower tapered portion <b>36</b>, having a relatively small longitudinal length which forms a transition between the intermediate portion <b>32</b> and the reduced end portion <b>28</b>. As shown in FIG. 2, each support member <b>18</b> further includes an upper, tapered portion <b>38</b>, which also has a relatively small longitudinal length, and forms a transition between the intermediate portion <b>32</b> and the reduced end portion <b>30</b> of member <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p>The relative lengths of the lower connecting member <b>16</b> and the reduced end portion <b>28</b> shown in FIG. 3 may be desirable in certain applications so that any vertical load existing in the support member <b>18</b> is reacted at the interface between a lower edge <b>40</b> of support member <b>18</b> and base <b>14</b>. This configuration provides increased surface area to react the load carried by support member <b>18</b> as compared to the configuration shown in FIG. 4, for the following reasons. The longitudinal length of the lower connecting member <b>16</b> shown in FIG. 4 is substantially the same as the longitudinal length of the reduced end portion <b>28</b> of support member <b>18</b>. Accordingly, a portion of the upper edge <b>34</b> of the lower connecting member <b>16</b> engages the tapered portion <b>36</b> of the support member <b>18</b>. The entire edge <b>34</b> may not contact the tapered portion <b>36</b> of member <b>18</b> due to the sloped surface of the tapered portion <b>36</b>. The configuration shown in FIG. 3 may be desirable in instances when the framing system <b>10</b> is used to frame a relatively heavily loaded wall, such as that which may be incorporated in a portion of a residential home, for instance. The configuration shown in FIG. 4 may be advantageously utilized when the corresponding support member <b>18</b> is subjected to a relatively smaller load.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, the base <b>14</b> may be attached to the foundation <b>12</b> by a plurality of concrete bolts <b>42</b> (one shown in FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>), with each bolt <b>42</b> being secured by a nut <b>44</b>. Alternatively, the base <b>14</b> may be attached, or secured to the foundation <b>12</b> by other conventional means, such as nails, screws, anchor bolts, or equivalent fasteners.</p>
    <p>Each of the lower joints <b>20</b> may comprise a staked joint as shown in FIGS. 3 and 5. In this instance, a local indentation <b>46</b> is formed in the lower connecting member <b>16</b> and a complimentary, local indentation <b>48</b> is formed in the lower end portion <b>28</b> of the corresponding one of the support members <b>18</b> so that the support member <b>18</b> and lower connecting member <b>16</b> are staked or secured to one another. Alternatively, for one or more of the lower joints <b>20</b>, the support member <b>18</b> and the corresponding lower connecting member <b>16</b> may be fastened to one another by conventional fasteners such as bolts or sheet metal screws. As yet another alternative, support members <b>18</b> may be secured to the corresponding lower connecting members <b>16</b> using nails or pins. Similarly, each of the upper joints may comprise a staked joint, with complimentary local indentations formed in the reduced upper end portion <b>30</b> and the corresponding one of the upper connecting members <b>24</b>. Alternatively, the reduced upper end portion <b>30</b> of the support member <b>18</b> may be fastened or pinned to the corresponding upper connecting member <b>24</b>, for one or more of the upper joints <b>26</b>.</p>

Similarly, the frame <b>142</b> further includes a plurality of upper window frame connecting members <b>182</b> which are attached to the window frame <b>178</b> by conventional means such as welding and extend upwardly therefrom. Each one of the upper window frame connecting members <b>182</b> is aligned with one of the upper connecting members <b>24</b> attached to the upper member <b>176</b>. The front wall frame <b>142</b> further includes a plurality of support members <b>184</b> which interconnect the base <b>154</b> and the window frame <b>178</b>. Each one of the support members <b>184</b> extends between and is interconnected to one of the lower connecting members <b>16</b> and an aligned one of the lower window frame connecting members <b>180</b>. Each of the support members <b>184</b> may have reduced upper and lower end portions, similar to that shown with respect to support members <b>18</b>, with the reduced upper and lower end portions being inserted into the lower window frame connecting members <b>180</b> and lower connecting members <b>16</b>, respectively. Alternatively, the lower window frame connecting members <b>180</b>, lower connecting members <b>16</b> and support members <b>184</b> may be replaced by similar members which are configured such as those shown in the embodiments illustrated in FIGS. 6-8.</p>
    <p>The exterior wall frame <b>142</b> further includes a plurality of support members <b>186</b> which interconnect the window frame <b>178</b> and the upper member <b>24</b>. Each one of the support members <b>186</b> extends between and is interconnected to one of the upper window frame connecting members <b>182</b> and the aligned one of the upper connecting members <b>24</b>. As with the support members <b>184</b>, the support members <b>186</b> may be configured as shown with respect to support members <b>18</b>, such that an upper end portion (not shown) of each support member <b>186</b> is inserted into the corresponding upper connecting member <b>24</b>, while the reduced lower end portion (not shown) of each one of the support members <b>186</b> is inserted into the corresponding one of the upper window frame connecting members <b>182</b>.</p>
    <p>The wall frame <b>142</b> further includes a door header <b>188</b> and a garage door header <b>190</b>. Both of the headers <b>188</b> and <b>190</b> are disposed below and supported by the upper member <b>176</b>. The headers <b>188</b> and <b>190</b> may be made from rectangular metal tubing. The wall frame <b>142</b> further includes a plurality of header connecting members <b>192</b>, made of rectangular metal tubing, which are attached to the garage door header <b>190</b> by conventional means such as welding and extend upwardly therefrom. At least one of the header connecting members <b>192</b> is attached to and extends upwardly from the door header <b>188</b>. The wall frame <b>142</b> further includes a plurality of support members <b>194</b>, with each one of the support members <b>194</b> extending between and being interconnected to one of the header connecting members <b>192</b> and an aligned one of the upper connecting members <b>24</b>, thereby interconnecting the door header <b>188</b> and the garage door header <b>190</b> with the upper member <b>176</b>. The support members <b>194</b> may be configured with reduced upper and lower end portions as shown with respect to support member <b>18</b> and therefore, may be interconnected to the upper connecting members <b>24</b> and the header connecting members <b>192</b> as shown in FIG. 2 with respect to members <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> and <b>24</b>. Alternatively, other configurations of rectangular metal tubing, such as the upper and lower connecting members and the support members shown in FIGS. 6-8 may be used to interconnect the door header <b>188</b> and garage door header <b>190</b> with the upper member <b>176</b>. However, as stated previously, the use of square metal tubing as shown in FIG. 9 is not presently preferred in residential home applications. This may change in the future due to changes in the construction industry and therefore the use of square metal tubing to construct interconnected components of framing system <b>140</b> is considered to be within the scope of the present invention.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 13, the side wall frame <b>144</b> is illustrated and discussed in further detail. The wall frame <b>144</b> further includes an upper member <b>196</b> and a plurality of the upper connecting members <b>24</b> attached to the upper member <b>196</b> by conventional means such as welding and extending downwardly therefrom. Frame <b>144</b> further includes a plurality of the support members <b>18</b>, with each one being interconnected to and extending between one of the lower connecting members <b>16</b> and an aligned one of the upper connecting members <b>24</b>. A pair of window frames <b>198</b>, which may be made from rectangular metal tubing, are disposed between and connected to the base <b>162</b> and upper member <b>196</b> of wall frame <b>144</b>. A plurality of the lower window frame connecting members <b>180</b> and upper window frame connecting members <b>182</b>, discussed previously with respect to window frames <b>178</b> of wall frame <b>142</b>, are attached to each one of the window frames <b>198</b> of wall frame <b>144</b> as shown in FIG. <b>13</b>. Wall frame <b>144</b> further includes a plurality of relatively short support members <b>200</b> which interconnect the base <b>162</b> and the window frames <b>198</b>, and a plurality of relatively short support members <b>202</b> which interconnect the window frames <b>198</b> with the upper member <b>196</b>. Each of the support members <b>200</b> extends between and is interconnected to one of the lower connecting members <b>16</b> and an aligned one of the lower window frame connecting members <b>180</b>. Each of the support members <b>202</b> extends between and is interconnected to one of the upper window frame connecting members <b>182</b> and an aligned one of the upper connecting members <b>24</b>. Except for length, members <b>200</b> and <b>202</b> are the same as members <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p>The manner in which one of the support members <b>18</b> of the side wall frame <b>146</b> interfaces with the corresponding lower connecting member <b>16</b> is illustrated in FIG. 15 which is similar to FIG. 3 discussed previously with respect to framing system <b>10</b>. As shown in FIG. 15, the lower, reduced end portion <b>28</b> of the member <b>18</b> extends above the lower connecting member <b>16</b> for purposes of providing increased surface area to react the load carried by support member <b>18</b> as discussed previously with respect to framing system <b>10</b>. The connection shown in FIG. 15 is typical of the manner in which all the support members of framing system <b>140</b> are interconnected to the corresponding lower connecting members and to the corresponding upper connecting members.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 16-18 illustrate a framing system <b>210</b> according to an eighth embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 16 is an isometric view of the framing system <b>210</b> as assembled, while FIG. 17 is an exploded, isometric view showing the various components of the framing system <b>210</b> in further detail. The framing system <b>210</b> has particular application for use in framing a carport. Framing system <b>210</b> includes a first base <b>212</b> and a second base <b>214</b> which is laterally spaced apart from base <b>212</b>. As shown in FIG. 17, base <b>212</b> includes first <b>216</b>, second <b>218</b> and third <b>220</b> portions, and each of the portions <b>216</b>-<b>220</b> preferably comprises either a rectangular or square metal tube. Alternatively, portions <b>216</b>-<b>220</b> may comprise other metal structures, such as metal plates, channel sections or angled sections. As a further alternative, base <b>212</b> may be made as a unitary construction, either out of rectangular or square metal tubing or one of the foregoing alternative metal structures.</p>
    <p>Base <b>214</b> similarly includes first <b>222</b>, second <b>224</b>, and third <b>226</b> portions, with each comprising a rectangular metal tube in the illustrative embodiment. However, portions <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> and <b>226</b> may alternatively be made of square metal tubing or the alternative metal structures listed previously with respect to base <b>212</b>. Each of the base portions <b>216</b>-<b>222</b> of bases <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> is attached to a foundation <b>229</b> of the carport in the illustrative embodiment by conventional means such as a plurality of nails <b>231</b> as further illustrated in FIG. <b>18</b>. In other embodiments the framing system <b>210</b> may rest on a ground surface. The framing system <b>210</b> farther includes a first plurality of lower connecting members <b>228</b> which are attached to the base <b>212</b> by conventional means such as welding, and extend upwardly therefrom. Framing system <b>210</b> further includes a second plurality of lower connecting members <b>228</b> attached to the base <b>214</b> in a similar manner. Each of the lower connecting members <b>228</b> includes a lower portion <b>230</b> which is attached to the corresponding one of bases <b>212</b> and <b>214</b>, and an upper portion <b>232</b> which has a reduced cross-sectional size relative to the lower portion <b>230</b>. The reduction in size of the upper portion <b>232</b> is preferably accomplished by the roll reduction process discussed previously. The framing system <b>210</b> further includes a plurality of first side posts <b>234</b>, with each having a substantially straight portion <b>236</b> and an arcuate portion <b>238</b> integral with an upper end of the substantially straight portion <b>236</b>. The reduced end portion <b>232</b> of each one of the lower connecting members <b>228</b> is inserted into a lower end <b>240</b> of the substantially straight portion <b>236</b> of one of the first side posts <b>234</b>.</p>
    <p>The framing system <b>210</b> further includes a plurality of second side posts <b>242</b> which are preferably identical in construction to the side posts <b>234</b>. Each of the second side posts <b>242</b> includes a substantially straight portion <b>244</b> and an upper, arcuate portion <b>246</b> which is integral with the substantially straight portion <b>244</b>. The reduced end portion of each one of the second plurality of lower connecting members <b>228</b> is inserted into a lower end <b>248</b> of the substantially straight portion <b>244</b> of one of the second side posts <b>242</b>. The interconnected members may be further secured by one or more bolts <b>249</b> or alternatively the second side posts <b>242</b> may be staked to the corresponding lower connecting member <b>228</b>. The first side posts <b>234</b> may be similarly connected to the lower connecting members <b>228</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIGS. 16 and 17, each of the first side posts <b>234</b> is aligned with one of the second side posts <b>242</b> and is interconnected to the aligned one of the second side posts <b>242</b> by a bridge member <b>250</b>. Each of the bridge members <b>250</b> includes a pair of rafters <b>252</b> and a peak <b>254</b> in the illustrative embodiment. Each of the rafters <b>252</b> has a first end portion <b>256</b>, an intermediate portion <b>258</b> and a second end portion <b>260</b>. The end portions <b>256</b> and <b>260</b> have a reduced cross-sectional size relative to that of the intermediate portion <b>258</b>, with the reduced end portions <b>256</b> and <b>258</b> of rafters <b>252</b> preferably being formed by the roll reduction process discussed previously. The end portion <b>256</b> of a first one of the rafters <b>252</b> of each bridge member <b>254</b> is inserted into the arcuate portion <b>238</b> of the corresponding one of the first side posts <b>234</b>. The reduced end portion <b>256</b> of the second rafter <b>252</b> of each bridge member <b>250</b> is inserted into the arcuate portion <b>246</b> of the aligned second side post <b>242</b>. The ends <b>260</b> of each of the pair of rafters is then inserted into opposite ends of the corresponding peak <b>254</b>.</p>
    <p>Each of the following components of the framing system <b>210</b> preferably comprises a rectangular metal tube and even more preferably comprises a rectangular metal tube having a cross-section which has outside dimensions of 1½ inches×3½ inches: base portions <b>216</b>-<b>222</b>; lower connecting members <b>228</b>; first <b>234</b> and second <b>242</b> side posts; rafters <b>252</b> and peaks <b>254</b>.</p>
    <p>Each bridge member <b>250</b> may alternatively comprise a unitary construction or as another alternative, may be constructed of fewer or greater components provided the same overall shape of each bridge member <b>250</b> is substantially retained. Furthermore, the configurations of the ends of selected components of the flaming system <b>210</b> may be varied to achieve the same results. For instance, each of the lower connecting members <b>228</b> may comprise a substantially uniformly shaped rectangular tube, with the lower ends <b>236</b> and <b>248</b> of the first <b>234</b> and second <b>242</b> side posts comprising reduced end portions which are inserted into the corresponding lower connecting members <b>228</b>.</p>
    <p>The arcuate portions of the first <b>234</b> and second <b>242</b> side posts, as well as peaks <b>254</b> is achieved by bending the corresponding rectangular metal tubes and provides the advantage of eliminating mitered joints which might otherwise be required.</p>
    <p>While the foregoing description has set forth the preferred embodiments of the present invention in particular detail, it must be understood that numerous modifications, substitutions and changes can be undertaken without departing from the true spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the ensuing claims. For instance, while the reduced end portions of the rectangular or square metal tubes included in the various embodiments of the present invention are preferably formed by the roll reduction process disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/957,354, these reduced end portions may be achieved by other methods such as die forming. The invention is therefore not limited to specific preferred embodiments as described, but is only defined by the following claims.</p>
