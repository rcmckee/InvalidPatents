    <heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading> <p num="p-0002">This application claims the benefit of the U.S. Provisional. App. No. 60/825,607 filed on Sep. 14, 2006.</p>
    <p num="p-0003">In an embodiment, the adjustable bed systems and methods described herein could be used in combination with the systems and methods disclosed in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/823,891 filed on Aug. 29, 2006, and incorporated by reference herein.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading> <p num="p-0004">1. Field</p>
    <p num="p-0005">This invention relates to an adjustable bed.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">2. Background</p>
    <p num="p-0007">Adjustable beds may contain at least one section of which a user may control the position. The user may typically adjust the bed by using a control to move the adjustable section in its direction of movement. Additionally, the adjustable bed may include various types of mattresses and vibration of sections. Often, users that have adjustable beds because a medical issue may require certain positions to aid recovery, positioning to relieve discomfort as a result of pain, or the like. These users may, because of these issues, spend significant amount of time in the adjustable beds, some users may be confined to bed.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">Many existing adjustable beds may provide the basic requirements of moving bed sections to positions that are required by a user, but do not account for controlling other devices that may be beneficial to the user and provide for a level of independence to the user.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">A typical adjustable bed may consist of a wood decking for each of the sections of the bed connected together with hinges to allow the various positions between the sections. There are actuators connected between the bed frame and the wood decking for moving the adjustable sections into user-desired positions. The adjustable bed may have a “wall hugging” feature that maintains a consistent distance between the mattress and the wall as the bed is adjusted. Some adjustable beds may use wooden or plastic slats to support the mattress instead of a solid wood platform.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">The adjustable bed may have at least one actuator to position the adjustable bed sections. In some cases there is one actuator to position more than one, such as positioning both the thigh and foot sections with one actuator. There may also be more than one actuator for each adjustable section.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">Hospitals have used adjustable beds for many years to provide comfortable and medical required positions.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">A need exists for an adjustable bed that provides for the adjustable function required in an adjustable bed and provides for control of additional devices, a plurality of different bed section actuator types and movable memory types that may provide independent activities to the user of the adjustable bed.</p>

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES</heading> <p num="p-0081">In the following description, terms such as ‘adjustable mattress’, ‘adjustable bed’, ‘adjustable bed facility’ and the like are used interchangeably to refer generally to an apparatus including a sleeping or resting surface with one or more adjustable or moveable sub-surfaces that can be positioned for user comfort and/or convenience, unless a specific meaning is explicitly provided or otherwise clear from the context</p>
    <p num="p-0082">As users spend more and more time in adjustable beds they may desire to have a level of independence by controlling devices that may be in the room from the adjustable bed. The devices and facilities that users may wish to control may include audio equipment, video equipment, lamps, air purification facilities, power outlets, and the like. It may be desirable for the user to control these devices and facilities from the adjustable bed without having to leave the bed or ask for aid from someone else. For example, the user may be confined to the bed and may want the simple ability to control the lights around the adjustable bed.</p>
    <p num="p-0083">In an embodiment, an adjustable bed may not be the only rest facility to benefit from position and additional function control. Users may also use beds, adjustable beds, adjustable chairs, adjustable couches, and the like to provide comfortable positions when the user may have limited mobility. For example, a user that has had hip replacement surgery may not be confined to bed but may require a chair or couch to be adjustable to provide a comfortable sitting position while providing control of other devices within the room to limit the number of times the user must get up and adjust the devices. In an embodiment, while recovering from a surgery, an injury, an illness, or the like, the user may use more than one type of rest facility. The user may require confinement to an adjustable bed for a time and then, with health improvement, be able to move to either an adjustable chair or adjustable couch.</p>
    <p num="p-0084">Aspects of the invention may be described as an adjustable bed, but it may be understood that the same aspects may be applied to other rest facilities that may include a bed, a couch, a chair, or the like. Such rest facilities may be in a home, a car, a recreational vehicle, a cruise ship, an airline, a train, or anywhere that a user required them, and they may be fixed or mobile.</p>
    <p num="p-0085">One aspect of this invention may be to provide the adjustable bed with more than one power option to move the adjustable bed sections. The adjustable bed may use electric motors with gearboxes, pneumatic springs, hydraulic springs, or the like to actuate the adjustable bed sections. There may be both pricing and durability reasons to have the different actuation types.</p>
    <p num="p-0086">Another aspect of this invention may be to provide the ability to provide additional functionality to the adjustable bed by using modular controls that may be able to communicate with the user's interface control. The modular controls may be designed to control a number of additional devices and facilities that may include audio devices, video devices, lamps, air purification facilities, power outlets, and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0087">Another aspect of the adjustable bed may be to provide a support structure to support the bed materials (e.g. mattress), motors, actuators, hinges between bed sections, and the like. The support structure may be a frame structure to provide the support yet remain lightweight.</p>
    <p num="p-0088">Another aspect may be the use of replaceable memory to maintain the bed memory and software applications. The replaceable memory may allow user specific information to be moved from one adjustable bed to another adjustable bed. This may be useful in care facilities where a user may move from one bed to another bed during the stay in the care facility. If the user has saved a preferred positioning of the adjustable bed, when the user moves to another bed, the preferred positioning settings may be moved to the other bed with the user.</p>
    <p num="p-0089">Another aspect of the adjustable bed may be to provide safety features that may control the retraction of the adjustable bed sections to reduce the risk of crushing an object that may be under the adjustable bed.</p>
    <p num="p-0090">Now referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a block diagram of the various components of the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> is shown. In an embodiment, an adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> may be made up of a number of devices and facilities that may include actuators <b>104</b>, springs <b>108</b>, mattresses <b>110</b>, a sub-frame <b>112</b>, a skeleton structure <b>114</b>, vibration motors <b>118</b>, supports <b>120</b>, safety brackets <b>122</b>, an electronic facility <b>124</b>, an air purification facility <b>144</b>, a remote <b>148</b>, a memory facility <b>150</b>, a memory connection <b>160</b>, a network connection <b>162</b>, and the like. In an embodiment, the electronic facility <b>124</b> may include a wire harness <b>128</b>, a receiver <b>130</b>, modular controls <b>132</b>, a control box <b>134</b>, power outlets <b>138</b>, a power connection <b>142</b>, and the like. In an embodiment, the memory facility <b>150</b> may include a receiver learn facility <b>152</b>, bed memory <b>154</b>, a backup battery <b>158</b>, and the like. In an embodiment, the receiver learn facility <b>152</b>, bed memory <b>154</b>, and backup battery <b>158</b> may not be part of the memory facility <b>150</b>, but may be combined into other facilities or devices, be stand-alone devices, or the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0091">In an embodiment, the physical aspects of the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> that provide support for the user may include the actuators <b>104</b>, springs <b>108</b>, mattresses <b>110</b>, a sub-frame <b>112</b>, a skeleton structure <b>114</b>, vibration motors <b>118</b>, supports <b>120</b>, and safety brackets <b>122</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0092">In an embodiment, the skeleton structure <b>114</b> may provide the central structure that the other physical aspects may interact with. In an embodiment, the skeleton structure <b>114</b> may provide direct support to the mattress <b>110</b>, springs <b>108</b>, and the like. In an embodiment, the skeleton structure <b>114</b> may be a lightweight frame structure that may provide both the strength and rigidity required to properly support the mattress <b>110</b> and springs <b>108</b>. In embodiments, the skeleton structure <b>114</b> may use materials that include metal, plastic, wood, or the like; the materials may be used individually or in combination.</p>
    <p num="p-0093">In an embodiment, springs <b>108</b> may be used with a mattress <b>110</b>, instead of a mattress <b>110</b>, or the like. In an embodiment, the springs may be a standard bed spring system (e.g. coils within a wire framework), individual coil springs, individual foam springs, air springs, or the like. In an embodiment, the individual springs (e.g. coil, foam, or air) may be used to provide variable firmness to provide comfort to the user. For example, the springs <b>108</b> may be less firm or firmer in a local area to provide the user with the support that may be required for a body location that is experiencing discomfort (e.g. a hip, shoulder, back, neck). Springs that may have local firmnesses will be described in more detail below.</p>
    <p num="p-0094">In an embodiment, the mattress <b>110</b> may include foam, feathers, springs <b>108</b>, material, or the like. In an embodiment, the different materials may be used individually or in combination. The mattress may be intended to provide the user with a firmness that provides for the comfort requirements of the user.</p>
    <p num="p-0095">In an embodiment, the mattress <b>110</b> may be an air mattress <b>110</b>. In an embodiment, the air mattress <b>110</b> may be constructed using a single chamber, a plurality of chambers, a plurality of individual chambers, a combination of chamber shapes, or the like. In an embodiment, the air mattress <b>110</b> may be inflated to various pressures that may provide the user with the desired comfort level. In an embodiment, there may be separate air mattresses <b>110</b> for each of the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> sections. For example, there may be separate air mattresses <b>110</b> for the head, torso, and foot sections of the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b>. In an embodiment, the inflation pressure of the individual air mattresses <b>110</b> may be different from each other depending on user settings.</p>
    <p num="p-0096">In an embodiment, the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> sections may each contain individual air mattresses <b>110</b>. For example, the head, torso, and foot sections may each have individual air mattresses that may be individually controlled for air pressures and therefore firmness. In an embodiment, the user may be able to control the firmness of the individual air mattresses <b>110</b> using a remote <b>148</b>. In an embodiment, the remote <b>148</b> may have indicators for each of the firmness adjustable air mattresses <b>110</b>. For example, the remote <b>148</b> may have keys for increasing or decreasing the pressures of the individual air mattresses <b>148</b>. Using the remote <b>148</b>, the user may be able to adjust the firmness of the adjustable bed facility sections.</p>
    <p num="p-0097">In an embodiment, the air mattress <b>110</b> may use a common air supply source facility as an air actuator <b>104</b>. In an embodiment, a control box <b>134</b> may control both the air mattress <b>110</b> and air actuator <b>104</b>. The control box <b>134</b> may provide controlling commands to both the air mattress <b>110</b> and air actuators.</p>
    <p num="p-0098">In an embodiment, the skeleton structure <b>114</b> may have structural members that support the mattress <b>110</b> and springs <b>108</b> and may also provide support and connections for the actuators <b>104</b>, sub-frame <b>112</b>, supports <b>120</b>, vibrator motors <b>118</b>, safety bracket <b>122</b>, and the like. In an embodiment, the structural members may be positioned on the peripheral edges of the mattress <b>110</b> and springs <b>108</b> to provide overall support and rigidity to the mattress <b>110</b> and springs <b>108</b> and may form the base of the individual adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> sections. Additionally, there may other structural members as support, cross pieces, or the like that may provide additional support to the mattress <b>110</b> and springs <b>108</b> as may be required. A person knowledgeable in the art may understand that the frame structure may have many different construction configurations to provide support and rigidity to the mattress <b>110</b> and springs <b>108</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0099">In an embodiment, the skeleton structure <b>114</b> may form the base of the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> sections that may be moved relative to each other to provide the various bed positions required by the user. The adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> may include more than one section; a section may be fixed or may be adjustable. For example, the typical adjustable bed may have adjustable sections for the head, leg, and foot while the torso section may remain fixed and horizontal. There may be different combinations of movable and fixed sections with one or all of the sections being movable. In an embodiment, the sections may include the skeleton structure <b>114</b>, mattress <b>110</b>, springs <b>108</b>, and the like and may individually be small mattress structures of the entire adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> mattress.</p>
    <p num="p-0100">In an embodiment, the adjustable bed sections may be connected together using hinges or like devices that allow a freedom of motion between two adjacent adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> sections. In an embodiment, one section of the adjustable bed may remain fixed, such as the torso section, and act as the foundation for the other movable sections to be positions. In an embodiment, any or none of the sections may be a fixed foundation section in the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b>. In embodiments, there may be more than one adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> configuration depending on the requirements of a user, cost requirements, medical needs, or the like. For example, there may be a configuration where only the head section is adjustable to provide the user with the ability to have an elevated upper body position. This configuration may be a single purpose bed but may also provide the user with a less expensive adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> that meets the user's needs. One skilled in the art may understand that there may be many different adjustable bed facility configurations containing fixed and moveable sections.</p>
    <p num="p-0101">In an embodiment, the skeleton structure <b>114</b>, as part of each adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> section, may also provide support and connection members for the components that may be used to move the various adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> sections. There may be skeleton structure <b>114</b> members that provide connection support to the actuators <b>104</b>, supports <b>120</b>, safety brackets <b>122</b>, vibration motors <b>118</b>, and the like. These support and connection members may have any shape or configuration required to provide the support and connections needed by the various other components. For example, in addition to the skeleton structure <b>114</b> that is used to provide support to the mattress <b>110</b> and springs <b>108</b> there may be at least one cross member that may provide a connection to the actuator <b>104</b> and safety bracket <b>122</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0102">In an embodiment, the skeleton structure <b>114</b> and the sub-frame <b>112</b> may interface with each other; the sub-frame <b>112</b> may provide structural support and a rigid foundation base to the skeleton structure <b>114</b>. In an embodiment, the sub-frame <b>112</b> may be the rigid structure that is in contact to the floor and may provide a base for any fixed adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> sections and an interface for any movable adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> sections. In an embodiment, the sub-frame <b>112</b> legs may be connected to the sub-frame <b>112</b> using a threaded stud into threads of the sub-frame <b>112</b>. In an embodiment, to prevent the threaded stud from pulling out of the legs during tightening, the head of the threaded stud may be fixed between two or more layers of leg material. This construction may trap the threaded stud head to prevent it from moving away from the end of the leg and may also prevent the threaded stud head from being pulled through the end of the leg during the tightening of the leg to the sub-frame. In addition, the two or more layers of leg material may provide for added strength to the sub-frame <b>112</b> legs to prevent distortion at the sub-frame <b>112</b> and leg interface. In an example of a fixed torso section, the sub-frame <b>112</b> may provide a base to solidly connect the torso section to provide a fixed non-moving section. The other moveable sections may be moveably connected to the fixed torso section and additionally supported by the sub-frame <b>112</b> using a moveable interface connection.</p>
    <p num="p-0103">In an embodiment, the sub-frame <b>112</b> may have structural members that may run along the length of the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b>, run along the width of the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b>, run diagonally across the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b>, or other orientation in relation to the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> that may be required for support or connection to components.</p>
    <p num="p-0104">In an embodiment, the skeleton structure <b>114</b> may be used as an RF antenna for receiving communication from the remote <b>148</b>. In embodiment, the entire skeleton structure <b>114</b> may be used as an antenna; a portion of the skeleton structure <b>114</b> may be used as an antenna, or the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0105">In one embodiment, the sub-frame <b>112</b> may provide solid connections for any fixed section and skeleton structure <b>114</b> by rigidly connecting the skeleton structure <b>114</b> directly to the sub-frame <b>112</b>. In this manner, any fixed section and skeleton structure <b>114</b> may be rigidly connected to the sub-frame <b>112</b>, and through the sub-frame <b>112</b>, rigidly connected to the floor.</p>
    <p num="p-0106">In another embodiment, the sub-frame <b>112</b> may provide an interface for the fixed adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> section and skeleton structure <b>114</b> where the fixed section may be able to move or slide in relation to the sub-frame <b>112</b>. By providing a non-rigid interface connection between the sub-frame <b>112</b> and the skeleton structure <b>114</b>, the fixed adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> section may have a freedom of motion but still may be supported by the sub-frame in a solid foundation manner. For example, the fixed adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> section may have wheels that run in a track, groove, “C” channel, or the like of the sub-frame <b>112</b> and may be able to move horizontally during the motion of one or more of the movable adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> sections. In an embodiment, the horizontal freedom of motion may provide for a “wall hugger” feature where, as the head section is adjusted up or down, the fixed torso section may move, along with the head section, horizontally forward and away from an adjacent wall to maintain a fixed distance between the head section and the wall, therefore “hugging” the wall. It may be understood by one skilled in the art that the moveable interface between the skeleton structure <b>114</b> and sub-frame <b>112</b> may be any type of interface that may allow freedom of motion between the sub-frame <b>112</b> and skeleton structure <b>114</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0107">In an embodiment, any adjustable sections may have two connections, a first connection may be provided by a hinge type connection and a second connection may be the connection with the actuator <b>104</b> and safety bracket <b>122</b> that may provide the force to rotate the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> section up or down. In an embodiment, the hinge type connection between the skeleton structure <b>114</b> of a first section and a second section may provide the point of rotation for the section motion. In an embodiment, the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> may contain more than one section and any or all of the sections may be connected by a hinge type connection.</p>
    <p num="p-0108">In an embodiment, there may be a support gusset for connection between the actuator <b>104</b> and the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> section. In embodiments, the gusset may be an I beam, a T beam, an L beam, a box beam, or any other beam design that may provide the strength to lift the combined weight of the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> section and the user without bending. In an embodiment, to resist bending forces at the connections to the actuator <b>104</b> and the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> section, the ends of the gusset may be reinforced. In embodiments, the reinforcement may be an additional bracket added to the ends of the gusset, such as a U bracket or other bracket shape, to provide for increased material thickness and strength of the gusset ends. The thickness of the additional bracket may be determined by the amount of force and torque that may need to be resisted during the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> section movement.</p>
    <p num="p-0109">With the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> sections interconnected using hinge type connections there may be at least one actuator <b>104</b> that may provide a connection between a fixed adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> section and a moveable section. In an embodiment, the hinge connection between the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> sections may be a pivot point bracket that may include additional strengthening to resist bending forces. Similar to the gusset described above, the pivot point connections may have additional reinforcement, such as a U bracket or other shaped bracket, to provide for increased material thickness and strength to resist bending forces. The thickness of the additional bracket may be determined by the amount of force and torque that may need to be resisted during the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> section movement. In an embodiment, the actuation <b>104</b> connection may be between two of the skeleton structures <b>114</b>. For example, a first end of the actuator <b>104</b> may be connected to the fixed torso section of the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> and a second end of the actuator <b>104</b> may be connected to the section that is to be moved (e.g. head, leg, or foot sections). In an embodiment, the actuator <b>104</b> may use electric motors and mechanical gears, pneumatic pressure, hydraulic pressure, pneumatic spring, air spring, hydraulic spring or the like to provide the force to extend and retract the actuator <b>104</b>. The action of extending and retracting the actuator <b>104</b> may move the various movable bed sections up or down. By the actuator <b>104</b> pushing against the section, the section may rotate upward around the pivot point provided by the hinge type connection. In the same manner, by the actuator <b>104</b> pulling against the section, the section may rotate downward around the pivot point provided by the hinge type connection. In an embodiment, there may be at least one actuator <b>114</b> for every moveable adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> section.</p>
    <p num="p-0110">In an embodiment, the combination of actuator <b>114</b>, safety bracket <b>122</b>, and supports <b>120</b> may provide a safety feature to prevent an object that may be under the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> from being damaged, impinged, crushed, or the like during the decent of the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> section. During the downward motion of one adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> sections, the section may come in contact with an object that is under the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b>. If the actuator <b>104</b> is allowed to continue to pull the section in the downward direction, the object may be crushed under the force the actuator <b>104</b> may apply. In an embodiment, the safety bracket <b>122</b> may have a slot that may provide time to determine that there is an object under the section that is moving downward.</p>
    <p num="p-0111">In an embodiment, the slot may have a first side that is on the opposite side of the slot from the actuator <b>104</b> and a second side that is on the same side as the actuator <b>104</b>. In an embodiment, the slot that is between the first side and the second side may be of any length. In an embodiment, the actuator may push against the first side to move the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> section in an upward direction. In an embodiment, during the downward motion of the section, the actuator <b>104</b> may move at the same speed as the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> section and therefore the actuator connection to the safety bracket <b>122</b> may remain within the safety bracket <b>122</b> slot without contacting either the first or second sides of the slot. In an embodiment, the section may move in the downward direction under the weight of the section without the actuator <b>104</b> pulling on the second side of the safety bracket <b>122</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0112">In an embodiment, the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> section downward speed may be further controlled by supports <b>120</b> that may provide resistance to the section motion to control the rate of decent. In an embodiment, the support <b>120</b> may be a pressurized device using pneumatic pressure, hydraulic pressure, or the like to provide a resistive force to slow the decent of the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> section. In an embodiment, the supports may provide enough resistance to control the rate of decent of the section as the actuator <b>104</b> is retracted.</p>
    <p num="p-0113">In an embodiment, as the actuator <b>104</b> retracts, the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> section, with the aid of the support <b>120</b>, may descend at the same rate as the as the actuator <b>104</b> is retracting. By matching the rates of the actuator <b>104</b> retraction and the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> section descending, the actuator <b>104</b> connection within the safety bracket <b>122</b> slot may remain within the slot area and not contact either the first or second side of the slot. In an embodiment, as the section descends, if an object is encountered, the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> section may stop its decent and the actuator <b>104</b> connection will move within the safety bracket <b>122</b> slot without pulling the section downward. In an embodiment, the amount of time that the actuator <b>104</b> connection is moving within the safety bracket <b>122</b> slot while the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> section is stopped may provide time to the user to realize that an object has been contacted and to stop the downward motion of the section.</p>
    <p num="p-0114">In an embodiment, an additional safety feature may be the addition of a shut off sensor, shut off switch, or the like on the first side of the safety bracket <b>122</b> slot to stop the retraction of the actuator <b>104</b> if the actuator <b>104</b> connection comes in contact with the first side of the slot. In this manner, if the actuator <b>104</b> connection with the safety bracket <b>122</b> slot reaches the first side of the slot, the actuator <b>104</b> retraction may be stopped and the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> section will not be forcibly pulled down into the object that may be under the section. In an embodiment, there may be an indication to the user that the actuator <b>104</b> connection has come in contact with the first side of the slot and the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> sections downward motion has been stopped. In an embodiment, the indication may be an audio indication, a visual indication, a motion indication (e.g. vibration), or the like to indicate to the user that the motion has been stopped and there may be an obstruction with the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> section.</p>

The PLC may receive commands from the remote <b>148</b> for the modular controls <b>132</b> and may pass the command through to the modular control <b>132</b>, may interpret the remote <b>148</b> command and command the modular control <b>132</b>, or the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0145">In an embodiment, the PLC may interface with a modular control <b>132</b> that is associated with external power outlets. In this embodiment, the user may be able to control the setting of the external power outlet by selecting a setting on the remote <b>148</b>. The setting on the remote <b>148</b> may be received by the receiver <b>130</b> and PLC within the control box <b>134</b> to set the power outlet setting. For example, the user may be able to turn on the external power outlet by selecting an external outlet on input on the remote. This may result in the external outlet power being turned on to power an attached device such as a lamp.</p>
    <p num="p-0146">In an embodiment, the bed memory <b>154</b> may be part of the PLC, external from the PLC, a combination of internal and external memory from the PLC, or the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0147">In an embodiment, the bed memory <b>154</b> may be separate from the control box <b>134</b> and the PLC. In an embodiment, the bed memory <b>154</b> may be removable memory, the bed memory <b>154</b> may be moved from a first adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> to a second bed facility <b>102</b> to move user settings from the first adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> to the second bed facility <b>102</b>. For example, a user in a care facility may be moved from a first adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> to a second adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> but the user may have already determined and saved at least one preferred setting to the bed memory <b>154</b>. The bed memory may be removed from the first adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> and moved to the second adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> with the user and therefore the user may keep the same preferred adjustable bed <b>102</b> settings.</p>
    <p num="p-0148">In this manner the bed memory <b>154</b> may be considered portable memory. In an embodiment, the removable bed memory <b>154</b> may be flash memory, programmable logic circuit (PLC), secure digital (SD) memory, mini SD memory, Compact Flash type I memory, Compact Flash type II memory, Memory Stick, Multimedia Card, xD Picture card, Smartmedia, eXtreme Digital, Microdrive, or the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0149">In an embodiment, the bed memory <b>154</b> may be part of the remote <b>148</b>. As part of the communication between the remote <b>148</b>, receiver <b>130</b>, and control box <b>134</b> memory information may be exchanged between the remote <b>148</b> and control box <b>134</b>. For example, the user may indicate that a certain adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> position should be maintained for future recall. The control box <b>134</b> may receive the save position request from the remote <b>148</b> and transmit the position information back to the remote <b>148</b> for storage within the bed storage <b>154</b>. In a like manner, when the user requests the recall of a previously saved position, the control box <b>134</b> may request the position information from the remote <b>148</b> bed memory <b>154</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0150">In an embodiment, if the remote <b>148</b> is wireless, the remote <b>148</b> may contain both a transmitter and receiver, or a transceiver, to transmit and receive information with the control box <b>134</b>. In an embodiment, the remote <b>148</b> may communicate with the receiver <b>130</b> using a connection key. The connection key may be a code that indicates that a certain remote is associated with a certain adjustable bed facility <b>102</b>. When the remote <b>148</b> transmits information to the receiver, the remote may first send a key code to indicate that the remote <b>148</b> is associated with the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b>. If the key code matches the key that the receiver <b>130</b> is listening for, the receiver <b>130</b> may receive the command from the remote.</p>
    <p num="p-0151">In an embodiment, the bed memory <b>154</b> may maintain the position information for the user preferred positions of the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> sections. In an embodiment, the bed memory <b>154</b> may be implemented as a programmable logic circuit (PLC), a logic circuit (LC), or the like. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an embodiment of two methods of maintaining the user preferred positions in memory. In an embodiment, a first method may be to have discreet memory table <b>202</b> for each preferred user bed position <b>204</b>. There may be the same number of preferred bed positions <b>204</b> and memory locations <b>208</b> as indicators on the user remote <b>148</b>. For example, the remote may have two buttons for the user to set the preferred positions that may be used for later recall; the two buttons may be associated with two discreet memory locations <b>208</b>. In an embodiment, each time the user indicates a new preferred position for a button on the remote <b>148</b> the memory location <b>208</b> may be over written with the new position information. In an embodiment, this method may only allow the user to set one user preferred position for every button on the remote <b>148</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0152">In an embodiment, a second method of memory storage for user preferred adjustable bed positions may be a table <b>222</b> that may have a plurality of possible positions <b>212</b> the user may select. In an embodiment, as shown, the possible positions <b>212</b> may be P<b>1</b> through Pn. In an embodiment, the possible positions <b>212</b> may be a plurality of values that may define the range of available positions for the adjustable bed facility <b>12</b>; the plurality of values may be a set of values that define the range of available positions for one or more adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> functions. For example, the available positions <b>212</b> may be a set of increments of section positions that may include a set of actuator <b>104</b> positions, a set of actuator <b>104</b> activation times, bed section rotation angles, or the like. The set of increments may be determined from a base value for the section. For example, the increments may start at zero from the flat position for the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> section. In an embodiment, the user may be able to select the increment set to be used as possible positions <b>212</b> for the section. For example, the user may be able to select the type of graduations by selecting from a set of possible graduation methods such as distance, angle of rotation, actuation time, or the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0153">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the table <b>222</b> is shown with an increment column <b>210</b> and an indication column <b>220</b>. In an embodiment, the table <b>222</b> may have a plurality of columns <b>220</b> to store position information for any of the adjustable aspects of the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b>. For example, there may be an indication column <b>220</b> for the head section angle, the foot angle section, the vibration characteristics for the various vibration motors of the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b>, or the like. In another embodiment, the adjustable aspects of the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> may be represented by a plurality of individual tables <b>210</b> for storing indication information for each of the individual adjustable attributes for the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b>. The individual tables <b>210</b> may be substantially the same as the table <b>222</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> where there may be one column <b>210</b> for increments <b>212</b> and another column <b>220</b> for indication information (<b>214</b> and <b>218</b>). For example, there may be individual tables <b>210</b> for the head section angle, foot section angle, vibration motor characteristics, or the like. In an embodiment, the PLC may be able to access the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> settings by accessing large tables <b>210</b> that contain many columns, small tables <b>210</b> that contain a few columns, a combination of large and small tables <b>210</b>, or the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0154">In an embodiment, the PLC may store the tables <b>210</b> within the PLC memory for accessing the settings of the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b>. In another embodiment, the table <b>222</b> may be stored in memory outside of the PLC and the PLC may access the table <b>222</b> through an interface connection. The table <b>222</b> increment column <b>210</b> may represent a plurality of available positions associated with adjustable bed facility functions. In an embodiment, the increment values may be a measurement scale (e.g. inches or angle), may be the number of rotations of the actuator, the vibration frequency of the vibration motor, or other increment scale. In response to a user input, the indication column <b>220</b> may be marked with the indication <b>214</b> to represent the position intended by the user. When the user makes a request to save a position, the PLC may search the increment column <b>210</b> to determine which of the plurality of increments <b>212</b> represents the current position value of the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> section. Once the current position value increment <b>212</b> within the table <b>222</b> is determined, an indication <b>214</b> may be stored to the indication column <b>220</b> associated to the current position value increment <b>212</b>. In an embodiment, the indication <b>214</b> may be any character that may represent a position being selected such as a letter, a number, special character, or the like. In embodiments, the indication column <b>220</b> may include all indications, no indications, one indication, more than one indication, or the like to indicate the user's intended position. The storing of the indication association of the current position value with the user selected position may include adding a store indication to the table <b>222</b> entry representing the current position value, removing the current position value from the table <b>222</b> of values, removing a plurality of the table <b>222</b> values where the removal does not include removing the current position value, adding a store indication to every table <b>222</b> entry except a table <b>222</b> entry representing the current position value, or the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0155">In an embodiment, when a user indicates on the remote <b>148</b> that a position is to be saved in the table <b>222</b>, the PLC may select the increment value <b>212</b> from within the increment column <b>210</b> set of values that represents the current position of the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b>. The PLC may store an indication <b>214</b> associated with the increment value <b>212</b>; the stored indication associated with the current position value may be a recall value that may be recalled at a later time to reposition the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0156">In an embodiment, in response to the user requesting to return to a recall value, the PLC may scan the table <b>222</b> indication column <b>220</b> for an indication <b>214</b> that may represent the user's recall value. Upon locating the recall value indication <b>214</b>, the PLC may command the adjustable bed function to the recall value indicated <b>214</b> location, position, vibration, or the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0157">In an embodiment, the indication column <b>220</b> of the table <b>222</b> may initially contain indications <b>214</b> in all to the available discrete locations <b>212</b>. As a user indicates that current position value is the position to be stored within the table <b>222</b>, the indication <b>214</b> for the current position value may be removed from the table <b>222</b>. This may result in one increment location <b>212</b> being empty of an indication. In this case, when a user requests to return to the recall position, the PLC may scan the table <b>222</b> indication column <b>220</b> for the empty increment location <b>212</b>. Once the empty increment location is found, the PLC may command the adjustable bed function to the recall position, vibration, or other adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> function. In an embodiment, if the user stores a different current position value, the empty discrete location <b>212</b> may be filled with an indication and the new indication associated to the current position value may have the indication <b>214</b> removed. In an embodiment, the user may be able to clear the stored position by indicating a clear command and all of the increment locations <b>212</b> may be filled with indications <b>214</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0158">In an embodiment, the available increment locations <b>212</b> in the indication column <b>220</b> of the table <b>222</b> may initially contain no indications <b>214</b> so that the indication column <b>220</b> may be empty. As a user indicates that a current position value is the position to be stored within the table <b>222</b>, the indication <b>214</b> associated to the current position value may be added to the table <b>222</b>. This may result in one increment location <b>212</b> having an indication. In this case, when a user requests to return to recall value position, the PLC may scan the table <b>222</b> indication column <b>220</b> for the increment location <b>212</b> containing the indication <b>214</b> associated with the recall value. Once the increment location is found, the PLC may command the adjustable bed function to the recall value position, position, vibration, or other adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> function. In an embodiment, if the user stores a different position, the increment location <b>212</b> indication <b>214</b> may be removed and the new current position value may have the indication <b>214</b> added. In an embodiment, the user may be able to clear the stored position by indicating a clear command and all of the discrete locations <b>212</b> may have the indication <b>214</b> removed.</p>
    <p num="p-0159">In an embodiment, when a user indicates a current position value is to be indicated in the table <b>222</b>, the indication may represent the user's preferred adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> position. In an embodiment, the user's indicated current position value may be rounded to the closest table <b>222</b> increment location <b>214</b>. For example, if the user selects a current position value that is between two increment positions on the table <b>222</b>, an algorithm may be used to determine which of the increment positions are to be indicated in the indication column <b>220</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0160">Embodiments of the present invention involve setting a recall bed position in response to a user making a storage selection. The user's storage selection may send a command to the adjustable bed facility's <b>102</b> controller (e.g. the PLC) indicating that the user would like the present position of the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> stored such that the user can later have the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> return to the stored position. The user may use a user interface (e.g. the remote control <b>148</b>) and make such a storage selection once the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> is in a desired position. As described herein elsewhere, a plurality of position values that define a range of available positions for the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> may be stored in memory accessible by the adjustable bed facility's <b>102</b> controller. The available positions may be stored in a table <b>222</b> or other structure for example. Once the user initiates such a storage request, the controller may receive the request to save the current adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> position as a user selected position. The controller may then make a determination of which of the plurality of position values represent the current position of the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> to provide a current position value. In determining which of the plurality of position values represents the current position, the controller may use an algorithm to decide which of the plurality of values best represents the current adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> position. For example, the actual adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> position may match one of the values and the algorithm may then select the matching value as the one that best represents the current position. In another situation, the actual adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> position may not match any of the plurality of values. In this case an algorithm may be used to determine which value best represents the position of the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b>. The algorithm may run an averaging calculation, interpolation calculation or other form of prediction algorithm to select between two positions representing positions on either side of the actual adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> position, for example. Once the controller has made the determination as to which value represents the current adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> position, the controller may then store an association of the current position value with the user-selected position (e.g. as described elsewhere herein).</p>
    <p num="p-0161">The embodiment of unmarking <b>218</b> preferred positions will be used in the following illustrations, but it should be understood that marking a current position value may also be used as a method of indicating a preferred position <b>212</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0162">In an embodiment, the user may indicate the current position value by indicating a set position on the remote <b>148</b>; this indication may result in all of the possible increment locations <b>212</b> having an indication <b>214</b> except for the one increment the user has selected which may be non-marked <b>218</b>. For example, if the user selected the P<b>3</b> position <b>212</b> as a preferred position, all of the positions <b>212</b> may receive a mark <b>214</b> except the one position P<b>3</b> which may receive a non-mark <b>218</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0163">In an embodiment, the positioning recall position logic of the adjustable bed may seek possible positions <b>212</b> that do not have a mark <b>218</b> when determining what user positions to select.</p>
    <p num="p-0164">In an embodiment, the user may be able to set more than one increment position <b>212</b> in the table <b>222</b> for a single button on the remote <b>148</b>. For example, the user may be able to press a button on the remote <b>148</b> in a certain way to set a non-mark <b>218</b> at different preferred positions <b>212</b>. In another example, when the user presses a button on the remote <b>148</b>, the current position value may be unmarked <b>218</b> as a preferred position and an algorithm may be executed to unmark <b>218</b> other preferred positions <b>212</b> at certain increments from the user selected position. In one example of the algorithm, every 3<sup>rd </sup>position may be selected to be unmarked <b>218</b> as a preferred position <b>212</b>. The additional non-markings <b>218</b> may be by actuation time, section rotation angle, or the like. A person skilled in the art may understand that there may be any number of different methods of unmarking more than one position <b>212</b> using a single button on the remote <b>148</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0165">In an embodiment, with user preferred positions <b>212</b> unmarked <b>218</b> on the table <b>222</b>, the user may indicate on the remote <b>148</b> to recall the user preferred position <b>212</b>. In an embodiment, there may be an algorithm to search the table <b>222</b> for an unmarked <b>218</b> user preferred position <b>212</b> to position the bed to the recall value. Once the preferred position <b>212</b> is determined, the command logic may command the actuator or actuators to move the adjustable bed sections into the preferred position <b>212</b> recall value. In an embodiment, there may be more than one preferred position <b>212</b> unmarked <b>218</b> on the table <b>222</b>. In this case, the algorithm may seek the first unmarked <b>218</b> position <b>212</b> and move the adjustable bed section to that position. In an embodiment, if this is not the user desired position, the user may indicate again on the remote to recall a preferred position and the algorithm may seek the next unmarked <b>218</b> position <b>212</b>. A person skilled in the art may understand that there may be a number of different methods of recalling a plurality of marked <b>214</b> or unmarked <b>218</b> positions <b>212</b> from the table <b>222</b>.</p>

    <p num="p-0173">In an embodiment, the remote <b>148</b> and control box <b>134</b> may be able to control other devices that may be connected to modular controls <b>132</b>. In an embodiment, the modular controls <b>132</b> may be similar to the control box by interpreting commands to control a device, but may be unique to the device that is connected to it. In an embodiment, the modular controls <b>132</b> may control audio equipment, video equipment, lamps, air purification facilities, outlets, and the like. For example, the modular control <b>132</b> may be connected to audio equipment and may contain the command sequences to control the audio equipment based on commands that may be received from the remote <b>148</b>.

    <p num="p-0250">In an embodiment, the mattress retaining bracket <b>402</b> may be made of materials that include metal, plastic, rubber, wood, or the like. In an embodiment, the materials may be used individually or in combination.</p>
    <p num="p-0251">In an embodiment, as shown in VIEW A, when the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> is shipped to the user, the mattress retaining bracket <b>402</b> may be mounted upside down at the final location of the mattress retaining bracket <b>402</b>. This mounting method may provide benefits that may include mattress retaining bracket <b>402</b> breakage prevention, mattress retaining bracket <b>402</b> bending prevention, clear user understanding of the final mattress retaining bracket <b>402</b> location, prevention of the mattress retaining bracket <b>402</b> becoming lost, and the like. In an embodiment, as shown in VIEW B, once the user receives the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b> with the upside down mounted mattress retaining bracket <b>402</b>, the user may rotate the mattress retaining bracket <b>402</b> into the upright position and re-secure it to the adjustable bed facility <b>102</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0252">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an example of an adjustable bed <b>600</b> (without the mattress) is shown with the head <b>602</b> and foot <b>604</b> sections raised to an elevated position. This adjustable bed <b>600</b> shows that sections, in this case the foot <b>604</b> section, may be divided into more than one section to provide contouring of bed sections.</p>
    <p num="p-0253">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an example of actuators <b>104</b> connected to the bed frame <b>702</b> and the adjustable sections <b>704</b> is shown. In this case two actuators <b>104</b> are used, one for each adjustable bed section <b>704</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0254">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an example of more than one actuator <b>104</b> for each adjustable bed section <b>802</b> is shown, in this case there are two actuators <b>104</b> for each adjustable section <b>802</b>. In embodiments, more than one actuator <b>104</b> per section <b>802</b> may be used if the bed sections <b>802</b> are heavy, smaller actuators <b>104</b> are used, if the bed is a wide bed (e.g. king bed), or the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0255">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, an example of an adjustable bed <b>900</b> using slats <b>902</b> instead of wood decking for the foundation of the adjustable sections is shown. In embodiments, the slats <b>902</b> may be wood, plastic, rubber, cloth, elastic material, or the like. Using this design, the adjustable bed <b>900</b> may be provided with curved contours has shown in the head section <b>904</b>. In an embodiment, the curved sections may be constructed of a number of small connected individual sections.</p>
