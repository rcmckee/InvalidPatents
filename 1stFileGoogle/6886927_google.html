The ink cartridge includes an ink chamber for containing ink, an ink supply port, a packing member and a valve device. The ink supply port supplies ink from the ink chamber to the print head of the printing apparatus, the ink supply port comprising an external opening. The packing member is provided in the ink supply port and forms an ink channel for allowing a flow of ink. The packing member seals the ink supply needle of the printing apparatus by fitting therewith. The valve device is contained in the ink supply port and elastically abuts against the packing member. The valve device selectively opens and closes the ink channel in conjunction with the ink supply needle.</div>

<p num="p-0002">This is a divisional of application Ser. No. 09/437,246 filed Nov. 10, 1999; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p num="p-0003">This patent application claims priority based on Japanese patent applications, H10-320113 filed on Nov. 11, 1998, H11-228430 filed on Aug. 12, 1999 and H11-56676 filed on Mar. 4, 1999, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
  <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0004">1. Field of the Invention</p>
  <p num="p-0005">The present invention relates to a printing apparatus for ejecting ink on a printing medium from a print head supplied with ink through a tapered ink supply needle, and more particularly to an ink cartridge and an ink supply system removably attached to the printing apparatus.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
  <p num="p-0007">Typically, an ink cartridge having a supply port for providing ink is connected to a print head of a printing apparatus for ejecting ink on a printing medium from nozzle aperture of the print head. The printing apparatus has a hollow ink supply needle in the ink supply channel to supply ink to the print head. When the ink cartridge is mounted on the printing apparatus, the hollow ink supply needle is inserted into the ink supply port of the ink cartridge so that ink is introduced to the print head.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">When the ink cartridge includes a porous member within its ink chamber for absorbing ink, the ink chamber is depressurized by the porous member. Therefore, the ink cartridge needs to be sealed so as not to undesirably suck air or bubbles in the ink chamber.</p>
  <p num="p-0009"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> is a cross sectional view of an example of an ink cartridge and an ink supply channel. The ink cartridge <b>112</b> has an ink supply port <b>114</b> and a packing member <b>120</b> contained in the ink supply port <b>114</b> and fitting with an ink supply needle <b>118</b> which is connected to a print head <b>116</b>. The ink supply port <b>114</b> is sealed with a sealing film, not shown in the drawings, prior to use. When the ink supply needle <b>118</b> is inserted in the ink supply port <b>114</b> and fitted in the packing member <b>120</b>, the ink supply needle <b>118</b> penetrates the sealing film. Ink is then provided to the print head <b>116</b> via the ink supply needle <b>118</b>. The ink cartridge <b>112</b> is sealed by fitting the ink supply needle <b>118</b> with the packing member <b>120</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">When the ink cartridge <b>112</b> is removed from the printing apparatus with ink left therein, the sealing of the ink supply needle <b>118</b> with the packing member <b>120</b> is released. The result is that ink leaks from the ink supply port <b>114</b> or that air or a bubble enters the ink supply port <b>114</b>. This means that a user of the ink cartridge cannot remove the ink cartridge until ink in the ink cartridge is completely used up. The user cannot repeatedly exchange a plurality of ink cartridges with his choice while ink remains in the ink cartridge.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">There has been provided an ink cartridge as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,777,646, having an elastic slit wall formed at an opening of an ink supply port and a ball slidably received in the ink supply port which is always urged against the elastic slit wall by a spring.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">An ink supply channel of the conventional ink cartridge described above is opened by urging the ball with a hollow ink supply needle of the printing apparatus when the ink cartridge is mounted on the apparatus. The ink supply channel of the ink cartridge is closed when the hollow ink supply needle is removed from elastic slit wall because of the elastic force of the spring which always urges the ball against the elastic slit wall of the ink supply port. Therefore, ink does not leak from the ink supply port and air or bubble does not enter the ink supply port.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">The conventional ink cartridge, however, has a drawback that the structure of the ink supply port is complicated as shown in FIG. <b>27</b>. Therefore, the workability of the ink cartridge is deteriorated, and the manufacturing cost would rise up.</p>
  <p num="p-0014"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> shows another example of a conventional ink cartridge disclosed in Japanese patent application No. 5-229137 employing a packing member, or a rubber member disposed in the ink supply port and a ball which is urged against the packing member by a spring. Ink is supplied from an ink chamber to a print head via a cylindrical connecting means. The ball is urged by the cylindrical connecting means to move away from the packing member against the elastic force of the spring.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">The ink cartridge illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> has a packing member <b>134</b> disposed in the ink supply port <b>132</b> and a ball <b>136</b> abutting against the packing member <b>134</b> by means of an elastic force of a spring <b>138</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">In the conventional ink cartridge shown and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the packing member <b>134</b> serves as a valve seat sealing the ink supply port <b>132</b> with the connecting means, and the ball <b>136</b> serves as a valve body closing the ink supply port <b>132</b> in cooperation with the packing member <b>134</b>. However, the relative position between the ball <b>136</b> and the spring <b>138</b> is unstable. This may cause an undesirable insufficient sealing by the ball <b>136</b> with the packing member <b>134</b>. Furthermore, the connecting means needs to have a large contact area to sufficiently urge the ball <b>136</b> against the elastic force of the spring. Therefore, the connecting means is not easily inserted in the packing member <b>134</b>. Furthermore, because the ball <b>136</b> is always urged toward the packing member <b>134</b> by the spring, the through hole of the packing member <b>134</b> may be expanded. This is disadvantageous because it may cause an insufficient connection between the ball <b>136</b> and the packing member <b>134</b>.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0017">The present invention was made in view of the foregoing problems or drawbacks accompanying the conventional sealing structure of the conventional ink cartridge. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide an ink cartridge and an ink supply system for an ink jet type printing apparatus capable of closing an ink supply channel assuredly, sufficiently when it is not mounted on the printing apparatus and capable of opening the ink supply channel to allow ink to smoothly flow to a print head when it is mounted on the printing apparatus.</p>
  <p num="p-0018">Another object of the present invention is to provide an ink-jet type printing apparatus employing such ink cartridge.</p>

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0118">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. The embodiments described as follows are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention, but merely exemplify the invention. Not all of the features and the combinations thereof described in the embodiment are necessarily essential to the invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0119"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a first embodiment of an ink cartridge according to the present invention. As shown and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an ink cartridge <b>2</b> has an ink chamber <b>4</b> for containing ink, and an ink supply port <b>6</b> designed to establish an ink communication with the ink chamber <b>4</b>. The ink cartridge <b>2</b> is also provided with a packing member <b>8</b> disposed within the ink supply port <b>6</b>, and a valve member <b>10</b> located between the ink chamber <b>4</b> and the packing member <b>8</b>. The valve member <b>10</b> is always urged toward the packing member <b>8</b> by an elastic force of a compression spring <b>12</b> (see FIG. <b>2</b>). The packing member <b>8</b> is made of an elastic material such as a rubber or a plastic. The ink chamber <b>4</b> accommodates therein a porous member <b>5</b> which absorbs ink. Because of the fact that ink is absorbed in the porous member <b>5</b>, ink is retained in the ink chamber in a stable manner without splashing, even with the ink cartridge being mounted on a carriage of a printing apparatus reciprocating at a high speed. Since the porous member <b>5</b> is accommodated in the ink chamber <b>4</b>, the ink chamber <b>4</b> is always depressurized.</p>
  <p num="p-0120"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a part of the printing apparatus. The printing apparatus has a print head <b>102</b> fixed on the carriage, not shown in the drawings, a tapered ink supply needle <b>104</b> designed to establish a fluid communication with the print head <b>102</b>, and an ink cartridge holder <b>106</b>. The ink cartridge <b>2</b> is mounted on the ink cartridge holder <b>106</b> of the printing apparatus in such a way that the ink supply port <b>6</b> faces the ink supply needle <b>104</b> of the printing apparatus. When the ink cartridge <b>2</b> is mounted on the printing apparatus, the packing member <b>8</b> in the ink supply port <b>6</b> fits with the ink supply needle <b>104</b>. The ink is then introduced from the ink chamber <b>4</b> to the print head <b>102</b> through holes formed in the tip end of the ink supply needle <b>104</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0121"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an enlarged cross sectional view showing the ink cartridge <b>2</b>. The ink supply port <b>6</b> is provided with an external opening <b>14</b> coupling to the ink supply needle <b>104</b> of the printing apparatus, and an internal opening <b>16</b> opening to the ink chamber <b>4</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0122">The packing member <b>8</b> is press-fitted in the ink supply port <b>6</b>. The packing member <b>8</b> has a protruding portion <b>20</b> on its outside surface, fitting with a concave <b>22</b> formed on the side wall of the ink supply port <b>6</b>, in order to have the packing member <b>8</b> retained in the ink supply port <b>6</b>. The protruding portion <b>20</b> of the packing member <b>8</b> seals with the concave <b>22</b> of the ink supply port <b>6</b>. Thus, ink does not leak from the ink supply port <b>6</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0123">The packing member <b>8</b> is made of an elastic material such as a rubber material including a silicon rubber, a chloroprene rubber, a butyl rubber, a ethylene-propylene rubber, a nitrile rubber, and an elastmer material. The packing member <b>8</b> is provided, if desired, with a lubricant coat at areas with which the ink supply needle <b>104</b> contacts, in order to smoothly receive the ink supply needle <b>104</b>. The lubricant coat consists of a silicon resin or a fluorocarbon resin.</p>
  <p num="p-0124">One surface of the packing member <b>8</b> faces the ink chamber <b>4</b>. This surface of the packing member is formed with a cylindrical recess <b>30</b> having a diameter compatible to receipt of a part of the valve device, which will be explained in detail hereinbelow. The packing member <b>8</b> has a hole <b>32</b> defined in the center thereof, capable of receiving the ink supply needle <b>104</b> formed in the cylindrical recess <b>30</b>, having a diameter smaller than the diameter of the cylindrical recess <b>30</b>, thereby to form an ink channel.</p>
  <p num="p-0125">The hole <b>32</b> of the packing member <b>8</b> expands and seals the ink supply needle <b>104</b> of the printing apparatus, when the ink supply needle <b>104</b> is inserted into the hole <b>32</b>. The packing member <b>8</b> is formed with a protruding rim <b>34</b> surrounding the hole <b>32</b> formed in the above-mentioned surface of the packing member <b>8</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0126">The packing member <b>8</b> has a second surface facing the external opening <b>14</b>, with a first tapered portion <b>24</b> and a second tapered portion <b>26</b>. Each tapered portion on the second surface is tapered from the external opening <b>14</b> toward the ink chamber <b>4</b> for the purpose of guiding the ink supply needle <b>104</b> of the printing apparatus. The packing member <b>8</b> is also provided with a fitting portion <b>28</b> formed on the second surface, to fit with the ink supply needle <b>104</b> of the printing apparatus.</p>
  <p num="p-0127">The packing member <b>8</b> is press-fitted in the ink supply port <b>6</b> and defines an ink introducing chamber <b>36</b> within the ink supply port <b>6</b>. The ink introducing chamber <b>36</b> is an area defined between the packing member <b>8</b> and the ink chamber <b>4</b>. The valve member <b>10</b> is received in the ink introducing chamber <b>36</b>. The ink introducing chamber <b>36</b> has a cylindrical guide unit <b>38</b> having a through bore <b>38</b> <i>a</i>. The guide unit <b>38</b> receives a part of the valve member <b>10</b> in order to guide the valve member <b>10</b>. The guide unit <b>38</b> contacts with the part of the valve member <b>10</b> necessary to have the valve member <b>10</b> moved vertically with respect to the packing member <b>8</b>. The valve member <b>10</b> is always urged by a compression spring <b>12</b> toward the packing member <b>8</b>, to contact with the packing member for selectively closing the ink channel of the packing member <b>8</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0128"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an embodiment of the valve member <b>10</b>. The valve member <b>10</b> has a valve body <b>40</b> contacting with the packing member <b>8</b>, and a guide body <b>42</b> for guiding the valve body <b>40</b>. The guide body <b>42</b> helps the valve body <b>40</b> to move vertically with respect to the packing member, when the valve member <b>10</b> is received in the ink introducing chamber <b>38</b>. The valve body <b>40</b> has a sealing portion <b>44</b> for sealing the ink channel of the packing member <b>8</b> when the valve body <b>40</b> contacts with the packing member <b>8</b>, a spring support structure <b>46</b> for supporting the compression spring <b>12</b>, and an ink channel <b>48</b> suitable for the passage of ink when the valve body comes out of contact with the packing member by the ink supply needle of the printing apparatus. Here, the sealing portion <b>44</b> is substantially flat. A part of the ink channel <b>48</b> is formed by cutting off the sealing portion <b>44</b>. The guide body <b>42</b> has an axial portion <b>50</b> connecting to the valve body <b>40</b>, and a guide block <b>52</b> formed at an end of the axial portion <b>50</b> opposite to the valve body <b>40</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0129">Referring back to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the guide block <b>52</b> is slidably received in the guide unit <b>38</b>. The guide block <b>52</b> has a diameter larger than a diameter of the through bore <b>38</b> <i>a </i>of the guide unit <b>38</b>. The guide block <b>52</b> of the valve member <b>10</b> cooperates with the guide unit <b>38</b>, to have the valve body <b>10</b> move vertically with respect to the packing member <b>8</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0130">The print head <b>102</b> is of an ink jet type print head normally referred to as a piezoelectric type print head. In the piezoelectric type print head, by driving a piezoelectric transducer a pressure chamber is expanded to lead ink in, and applies a pressure to ink to eject ink droplets out of the print head. It is necessary to dissolve, during manufacturing, any bubbles in the ink within the cartridge of this type of print head, because bubbles in the ink may cause inadequate compression of the pressure chamber so that ink droplets do not eject as they are designed.</p>
  <p num="p-0131">In this case, the ink is injected in the ink cartridge at a negative pressure of minus 1 atom of the atmospheric pressure (1.033 kg/per square meter) when the ink cartridge is manufactured. The compression coil spring is designed to be strong enough to urge the valve member <b>10</b> toward the packing member <b>8</b> in order to have the valve member <b>10</b> form a contact with the packing member <b>8</b>, even under the low pressure condition.</p>
  <p num="p-0132">The internal opening <b>16</b> formed at the side of the ink supply port <b>6</b> opening to the ink chamber <b>4</b> has a dimension larger than the dimension of the ink introducing chamber <b>36</b> in which the valve member <b>10</b> is accommodated. The result is, ink can smoothly be introduced to the ink introducing chamber <b>36</b>, and can likewise smoothly flow to the ink supply port <b>6</b> and the ink chamber <b>4</b> of the ink cratridge. A filter <b>54</b> is provided between the internal opening <b>16</b> of the ink supply port <b>6</b> and the ink chamber <b>4</b> of the ink cartridge. The filter <b>54</b> collects dust or foreign particles existing in the ink chamber <b>4</b>. Furthermore, as the filter <b>54</b> has a dimension the same as that of the internal opening <b>16</b>, ink passes smoothly through the filter <b>54</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0133">A sealing film <b>56</b> which is designed to be penetrated by the ink supply needle may be adhered to cover the external opening <b>14</b> for sealing the ink supply port <b>6</b> prior to use. The sealing film <b>56</b> serves to close the ink supply port <b>6</b> and also to retain the packing member <b>8</b> at the external opening <b>14</b> of the ink supply port <b>6</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0134">The operation of the packing member <b>8</b> and the valve member <b>10</b>, when the ink cartridge <b>2</b> is mounted on the printing apparatus will be explained in the following in the present embodiment.</p>
  <p num="p-0135">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when the ink cartridge is not mounted on the printing apparatus, the valve body <b>40</b> is urged toward the packing member <b>8</b> by the compression spring <b>12</b>. The sealing portion <b>44</b> contacts with the protruding rim <b>34</b> surrounding the hole <b>32</b> of the packing member <b>8</b>. Thus, the ink introducing chamber <b>36</b> is closed by the packing member <b>8</b> and the valve member <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0136">As shown in FIG. <b>4</b>(A), the external opening <b>14</b> of the ink supply port <b>6</b> is adjusted to fit the ink supply needle <b>104</b> to have the ink cartridge <b>2</b> depressed in the ink cartridge holder <b>106</b> of the printing apparatus. The tapered ink supply needle <b>104</b> then penetrates the sealing film <b>56</b>, to be inserted into the fitting portion <b>28</b> whilst being guided by the first and second tapered portions <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> of the packing member <b>8</b>. When the ink cartridge <b>2</b> is further pushed into the cartridge holder <b>106</b> of the printing apparatus, the tapered ink supply needle <b>104</b> is smoothly inserted into the hole <b>32</b> of the packing member <b>8</b>. This causes the hole <b>32</b> to expand, and the fitting portion <b>28</b> of the packing member <b>8</b> seals the ink supply needle <b>104</b> (see FIG. <b>4</b>(B)). The ink supply needle <b>104</b> urges the flat sealing portion <b>44</b> of the valve member <b>10</b> upward. At the same time, the valve member <b>10</b> moves toward the ink chamber <b>4</b> against the elastic force of the compression spring <b>12</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0137">The ink supply needle <b>104</b> becomes held in communication with the ink introducing chamber <b>36</b> via the hole formed in the tip end of the ink supply needle <b>104</b>, and thus allows ink to flow to the print head <b>102</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0138">When the cartridge <b>2</b> is removed from the printing apparatus, the ink supply needle <b>104</b> is detached from the packing member <b>8</b>. The result is, the valve member <b>10</b> is urged toward the packing member <b>8</b> by the elastic force of the compression spring <b>12</b>. The sealing portion <b>44</b> of the valve member <b>10</b> closes the ink channel of the packing member <b>8</b> when the ink supply needle <b>104</b> is completely detached from the packing member <b>8</b>. It means that when the ink supply needle <b>104</b> is released from the fitting portion <b>28</b> of the packing member <b>8</b>, at the same time, the sealing portion <b>44</b> of the valve body <b>40</b> is urged toward the packing member <b>8</b> to close the ink introducing chamber <b>36</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0139">As shown in FIGS. <b>5</b>(A) and <b>5</b>(B), the packing member <b>8</b> may not be formed with a protruding rim <b>34</b> surrounding the hole <b>32</b> of the packing member <b>8</b>, to have the valve body <b>40</b> contact with the surface of the cylindrical recess <b>30</b>. FIG. <b>5</b>(B) shows the packing member <b>8</b> and the ink supply needle <b>104</b> of the printing apparatus, when the external opening <b>14</b> of the ink cartridge <b>2</b> is designed to have a size allowing the ink supply needle <b>104</b> of the ink cartridge <b>2</b> to be pushed into the ink cartridge holder <b>106</b>. In this case, the same operation as explained with reference to FIGS. <b>4</b>(A) and <b>4</b>(B) can be obtained.</p>
  <p num="p-0140">Furthermore, even when dust or foreign particles is contained in ink, the sealed connection between the packing member <b>8</b> and the valve member <b>10</b> can be ensured, because the contacting surface between the valve body <b>40</b> and the cylindrical recess <b>30</b> of the packing member <b>8</b> is large.</p>
  <p num="p-0141">As shown in FIGS. <b>6</b>(A) and <b>6</b>(B), the packing member <b>8</b> may have a tapered portion <b>58</b> larger than the tapered ink supply needle <b>104</b> at the second surface. Furthermore, as shown in FIGS. <b>7</b>(A) and <b>7</b>(B), the packing member <b>8</b> may have a single tapered portion <b>60</b> tapered from the external opening <b>14</b> to the hole <b>32</b> of the packing member <b>8</b>. In these cases, when the ink cartridge <b>2</b> is pushed into the ink cartridge holder <b>106</b> to have the ink supply needle <b>104</b> inserted into the hole <b>32</b> of the packing member <b>8</b>, the tapered portion <b>58</b> and the tapered portion <b>60</b> each fit with the ink supply needle <b>104</b>. The same operation as explained with reference to FIGS. <b>4</b>(A) and <b>4</b>(B) can also be obtained in these cases.</p>
  <p num="p-0142">Furthermore, even when dust is contained in ink, the sealed connection between the packing member <b>8</b> and the valve member <b>10</b> can be ensured, because the contacting surface between the valve body <b>40</b> and the cylindrical recess <b>30</b> of the packing member <b>8</b> is large.</p>
  <p num="p-0143">Further, in the embodiment shown in FIGS. <b>7</b>(A) and <b>7</b>(B), the sealed connection between the packing member <b>8</b> and the valve member <b>10</b> can be ensured because the fitting force between the tapered portion <b>60</b> and the ink supply needle <b>104</b> is strong.</p>
  <p num="p-0144">Although the packing member <b>8</b> shown in this embodiment is formed as one unit, the packing member <b>8</b> may be separately formed as comprising two units; one of which is a part with which the valve member <b>10</b> contacts and the other of which is a part with which the ink supply needle <b>104</b> fits.</p>
  <p num="p-0145"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows another example of the valve member <b>10</b> having a surface at the sealing portion <b>44</b>, facing the packing member <b>8</b>, formed with a spherical surface <b>45</b> to contact with the tip end of the ink supply needle <b>104</b>. With this spherical surface <b>45</b> of the valve member <b>10</b>, the sealed connection between the packing member <b>8</b> and the valve member <b>10</b> is ensured, even when the position of the valve member <b>10</b> varies.</p>
  <p num="p-0146">FIG. <b>9</b>(A) shows another embodiment of the valve member <b>10</b>. The components of the valve member <b>10</b> shown in FIG. <b>9</b>(A) are formed separately from one another, including a valve body <b>40</b> to form a contact with the packing member <b>8</b>, and a guide body <b>42</b> for guiding the valve body <b>40</b> vertically with respect to the packing member <b>8</b>. The valve body <b>40</b> has a sealing portion <b>44</b> and a plurality of, at least three, spring support structure <b>46</b> around the sealing portion <b>44</b>. The guide body <b>42</b> is formed as one piece, with an axial portion <b>50</b> being connected to the valve body <b>40</b> and a guide block <b>52</b>. The guide block <b>52</b> guides the valve body <b>40</b> vertically with respect to the packing member <b>8</b>, in cooperation with the guide unit <b>38</b> of the ink introducing chamber <b>36</b>. The end of the axial portion <b>50</b> of the guide body <b>42</b>, opposite to the guide block <b>52</b>, is secured to the sealing portion <b>44</b> of the valve body <b>40</b>, to assemble the valve member <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0147">The valve member <b>10</b> is incorporated in the ink supply port <b>6</b> by inserting the guide body <b>42</b> from the internal opening <b>16</b>, to be passed through the guide unit <b>38</b> of the ink introducing chamber <b>36</b>, entering the compression spring <b>12</b> from the internal opening <b>16</b> to be placed around the ink introducing chamber <b>36</b>, and fixing the valve body <b>40</b> to the guide body <b>42</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0148">The valve body <b>40</b> and the guide body <b>42</b> may be fixed to each other by providing a fixing hole <b>40</b> <i>a </i>to the valve body <b>40</b>. The guide body <b>42</b> is inserted into the fixing hole <b>40</b> <i>a </i>of the valve body <b>40</b>, and fixed by heat welding or adhesive as shown in FIG. <b>9</b>(B). Otherwise, the valve body <b>40</b> and the guide body <b>42</b> may be fixed to each other by forming a fixing hole having a thread to the valve body <b>40</b>, forming a thread to the axial portion <b>50</b>, and connecting these parts to each other as shown in FIG. <b>9</b>(C).</p>
  <p num="p-0149"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows another embodiment of the valve member <b>10</b>. The valve member <b>10</b> has a valve body <b>40</b> and a guide body <b>42</b>. The guide body <b>42</b> is provided with an axial portion <b>50</b> and a guide block <b>52</b>. The axial portion <b>50</b> and the guide block <b>52</b> of the guide body <b>42</b> are formed as one unit. The guide body <b>42</b> is made of an elastic material such as a plastic and formed with a groove <b>62</b> extending from the guide block <b>52</b> through the axial portion <b>50</b>. The valve body <b>40</b> may be made of the same elastic material, such as a plastic, and formed as one unit with the guide body <b>42</b>. When the ink cartridge <b>2</b> is mounted on the printing apparatus, the ink supply needle <b>104</b> contacts with and urges the valve body <b>40</b>. The valve body <b>40</b> may therefore be made of a soft and flexible material which does not damage the tip end of the ink supply needle <b>104</b>. The guide block <b>52</b> of the guide body <b>42</b> may be tapered toward the valve body <b>40</b> as shown in FIG. <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0150">In this embodiment, the valve member <b>10</b> is incorporated in the ink supply port <b>6</b> by entering the compression spring <b>12</b> from the internal opening <b>16</b> to be placed around the ink introducing chamber <b>36</b>. The edge of the guide body <b>42</b> having the groove <b>62</b> is pushed into the through bore <b>38</b> <i>a </i>of the guide unit <b>38</b>. The guide block <b>52</b> has a groove <b>62</b> which allows the guide block <b>52</b> to be buckled as it passes through the through bore <b>38</b> <i>a</i>, and then spreads to be retained in the guide unit <b>38</b>. In this case, the valve member <b>10</b> can be formed as one unit, therefore, the number of parts and working process are reduced.</p>
  <p num="p-0151">In the embodiment as described above, the guide block <b>52</b> of the valve member <b>10</b> has a groove <b>62</b>. However, the guide unit <b>38</b> may be formed to allow splitting into a plurality of strips for elastically accepting the guide block <b>52</b> of the valve device.</p>
  <p num="p-0152">As the valve member <b>10</b> is contained in the ink introducing chamber <b>36</b>, the valve member <b>10</b> needs to be manufactured in a small size. This leads that ink is not provided smoothly to the print head even when the ink channel is open. Therefore, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the valve member <b>10</b> is formed with a depression <b>44</b> <i>a </i>and the penetrating portion <b>44</b> <i>b </i>formed at the sealing portion <b>44</b> of the valve body <b>40</b> to allow ink to smoothly pass therethrough. The penetrating portion <b>44</b> <i>b </i>is formed at the outside of the sealing portion so that the sealing portion <b>44</b> can close the hole <b>32</b> of the packing member <b>8</b> when the sealing portion <b>44</b> contacts with the packing member <b>8</b>. The valve member <b>10</b> preferably has a plurality of these depressions <b>44</b> <i>a </i>and penetrating portions <b>44</b> <i>b </i>in order to pass ink from the ink chamber <b>4</b> to the print head smoothly.</p>
  <p num="p-0153">The ink introducing chamber <b>36</b> may have a depression <b>36</b> <i>a </i>formed at the side wall of the ink introducing chamber <b>36</b>. The depression <b>36</b> <i>a </i>is formed from the upper point where the sealing portion <b>44</b> of the valve body <b>40</b> positions when the valve member <b>10</b> is not urged by the ink supply needle <b>104</b> to the point where the sealing portion <b>44</b> of the valve body <b>40</b> positions when the valve member <b>10</b> is urged by the ink supply needle <b>104</b> in FIG. <b>12</b>. In this embodiment, ink is provided smoothly to the print head through the depression <b>36</b> <i>a</i>. The valve member <b>10</b> having a depression <b>44</b> <i>a </i>as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> may be used with this ink introducing chamber <b>36</b> as shown in FIG. <b>12</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0154">As for the ink cartridge <b>2</b> according to the present invention, the ink of the ink supply port <b>6</b> is sealed by the connection between the packing member <b>8</b> and the valve member <b>10</b>. Thus, it is not necessary to close the external opening <b>14</b> with a sealing film or any equivalent member thereof. Therefore, as shown in FIGS. <b>13</b>(A) and <b>13</b>(B), the sealing film <b>56</b> provided at the external opening <b>14</b> may be formed with a hole <b>56</b> <i>a </i>which enables the ink supply needle <b>104</b> to pass through. The hole may be formed by cutting the film in a cross shape as shown in FIG. <b>14</b>. By making the hole, the ink supply needle smoothly passes through the film.</p>
  <p num="p-0155">Furthermore, as shown in FIGS. <b>15</b>(A) and <b>15</b>(B), the ink cartridge <b>2</b> may have a protruding portion <b>14</b> <i>a </i>protruding from the external opening <b>14</b> toward the center thereof, as a retainer for retaining the packing member <b>8</b> at the external opening <b>14</b> of the ink supply port <b>6</b>. The protruding portion can be simply formed by protruding a part of the external opening <b>14</b>. The result is, the number of parts or components and manufacturing process are reduced.</p>
  <p num="p-0156">The external opening <b>14</b> may have a retreating opening <b>14</b> <i>b </i>as shown in FIGS. <b>16</b>(A) and <b>16</b>(B). The sealing film <b>56</b> is attached at the external opening <b>14</b> to retain the packing member <b>8</b> at the external opening <b>14</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0157">In this embodiment, the ink supply port <b>6</b> is open to the external ambient air, therefore, the packing member <b>8</b> and the valve member <b>10</b> are not influenced by the expansion and the contraction of the air in the ink supply port <b>6</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0158">FIGS. <b>17</b>(A) <b>17</b>(B) and <b>17</b>(C) show another embodiment of the ink cartridge according to the present invention. A packing member <b>8</b> and a valve member <b>10</b> are provided in the ink supply port <b>6</b> in the same way as the embodiment shown in FIG. <b>2</b>. The ink supply port <b>6</b> has an external opening <b>14</b> designed to face the ink supply needle <b>104</b> of the printing apparatus, and an internal opening <b>16</b> designed to open to the ink chamber <b>4</b>. The parts and components having the same symbols as FIG. <b>2</b> and not specifically mentioned here have the same operations and effects as those shown in FIG. <b>2</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0159">The packing member <b>8</b> has a first surface facing the ink chamber <b>4</b> with a protruding portion <b>8</b> <i>a </i>protruding from the fitting portion <b>28</b> toward the ink chamber <b>4</b>. The first surface has a hole <b>18</b> <i>a</i>, whose diameter is smaller than the diameter of the needle of the recording apparatus.</p>
  <p num="p-0160">The packing member <b>8</b> has a second surface facing the external opening <b>14</b> with a first tapered portion <b>24</b> and a second tapered portion <b>26</b> each tapered from the external opening <b>14</b> toward the ink chamber <b>4</b> at the second surface. The function of this is to guide the ink supply needle <b>104</b> of the printing apparatus. The packing member <b>8</b> further has a fitting portion <b>28</b> to fit with the ink supply needle <b>104</b> of the printing apparatus.</p>
  <p num="p-0161">The valve member <b>10</b> has a valve body <b>40</b> and a guide body <b>42</b>. The valve body <b>40</b> has a sealing portion <b>44</b> and a spring support structure <b>46</b>. The guide body <b>42</b> has an axial portion <b>50</b> and a guide block <b>52</b>. The sealing portion <b>44</b> of the valve body <b>40</b> has a surface facing the packing member <b>8</b> formed with a protruding portion <b>45</b> <i>b </i>to contact with the tip end of the ink supply needle <b>104</b>. The protruding portion <b>45</b> <i>b </i>has a size compatible with the hole <b>18</b> <i>a </i>of the protruding portion <b>8</b> <i>a </i>of the packing member <b>8</b>. The valve member <b>10</b> is received in the guide unit <b>38</b> of the ink introducing chamber <b>38</b>, to be moved vertically with respect to the packing member <b>8</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0162">The protruding portion <b>45</b> <i>b </i>has a height that permits it to form a contact with the tip end of the ink supply needle <b>104</b> at the time when the ink supply needle <b>104</b> forms a sealed connection with the packing member <b>8</b> as shown in FIG. <b>17</b>(B). It means that the valve member <b>10</b> is urged by the ink supply needle <b>104</b> to open the ink supply port <b>6</b> at the time when the ink supply needle <b>104</b> and the packing member <b>8</b> form a sealed connection with each other. Thus, undesirable air or bubble do not enter the ink supply port <b>6</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0163">In this embodiment, the tip end of the ink supply needle <b>104</b> contacts the protruding portion <b>45</b> <i>b </i>of the sealing portion <b>44</b> at the time when the tapered ink supply needle <b>104</b> fits with the packing member <b>8</b>. This forms a sealed connection between them, by mounting the ink cartridge <b>2</b> on the printing apparatus.</p>
  <p num="p-0164">When the ink cartridge <b>2</b> is further pushed toward the printing apparatus, the ink supply needle <b>104</b> fits into the fitting portion <b>34</b> of the packing member and is inserted into the hole <b>18</b> <i>a </i>of the protruding portion <b>8</b> <i>a </i>of the packing member <b>8</b> whilst forcing out any air. Then, the ink can be provided to the print head <b>102</b>. The valve member <b>10</b> is forcibly separated from the packing member <b>8</b> when the ink supply needle <b>104</b> is inserted into the ink supply port <b>6</b> whilst forming a sealed connection with the packing member <b>8</b> as described above. Therefore, the air compressed by the ink supply needle when it is inserting in the ink supply port does not enter the ink supply port <b>6</b> and the ink supply needle <b>104</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0165">When, on the other hand, the cartridge <b>2</b> is removed from the printing apparatus, the ink supply needle <b>104</b> is detached from the packing member <b>8</b>. The valve member <b>10</b> is urged toward the packing member <b>8</b> by the elastic force of the compression spring <b>12</b>. The protruding portion <b>45</b> <i>b </i>of the sealing portion <b>44</b> of the valve member <b>10</b> is accepted into the hole <b>18</b> <i>a </i>of the packing member <b>8</b>, whilst the ink supply needle <b>104</b> be detached from the packing member <b>8</b>. The sealing portion <b>44</b> of the valve member <b>10</b> forms a contact with the protruding portion <b>8</b> <i>a </i>of the packing member <b>8</b>. This closes the ink introducing chamber <b>36</b> when the ink supply needle <b>104</b> is almost detached from the packing member <b>8</b> but is still forming the sealed connection with the fitting portion <b>28</b> of the packing member <b>8</b>. Thus, the ink does not leak from, and undesirable air or bubble does not enter the ink cartridge through the external opening <b>14</b> of the ink supply port.</p>
  <p num="p-0166">FIGS. <b>18</b>(A) <b>18</b>(B) and <b>18</b>(C) show another embodiment of the ink cartridge according to the present invention. The ink cartridge has a packing member <b>8</b>. The packing member <b>8</b> has a protruding portion <b>8</b> <i>a </i>and a hole <b>18</b> <i>a </i>formed at the protruding portion <b>8</b> <i>a </i>of the packing member <b>8</b> in the same way as that shown in FIGS. <b>17</b>(A) <b>17</b>(B) and <b>17</b>(C).</p>
  <p num="p-0167">The valve member <b>10</b> has a valve body <b>40</b> and a guide body <b>42</b>. The valve body <b>40</b> has a sealing portion <b>44</b> and a spring support structure <b>46</b>. The guide body <b>42</b> has an axial portion <b>50</b> and a guide block <b>52</b>. The sealing portion <b>44</b> of the valve body <b>40</b> has a surface facing the packing member <b>8</b>, formed with a convex surface <b>45</b>. The convex surface <b>45</b> is a spherical surface. The spherical surface of the valve body <b>40</b> has a diameter of curvature larger than a diameter of a widest part of the valve body <b>40</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0168">FIG. <b>19</b>(A) shows an enlarged cross sectional view of the valve member <b>10</b> having a spherical convex surface <b>45</b>. The convex surface <b>45</b> of the sealing portion <b>44</b> of the valve body <b>40</b> is like a part of a sphere having a diameter “R”. The diameter R of the sphere is larger than the length “L” of the axial portion <b>50</b> of the valve member <b>10</b>. Thus, the sealed connection between the packing member <b>8</b> and the valve member <b>10</b> is ensured even when the position of the valve member <b>10</b> varies.</p>
  <p num="p-0169">Assuming the diameter of curvature of the spherical convex surface <b>45</b> of the valve body <b>40</b> as “R”, “2R” (2×R) is at least longer than the widest part “d” of the valve body <b>40</b> as shown in FIG. <b>19</b>(A).</p>
  <p num="p-0170">In this embodiment, the tip end of the ink supply needle <b>104</b> contacts the spherical convex <b>45</b> of the sealing portion <b>44</b>. This occurs at the time when the tapered ink supply needle <b>104</b> fits with the packing member <b>8</b>, to form the sealed connection with each other when mounting the ink cartridge <b>2</b> on the printing apparatus.</p>
  <p num="p-0171">When the ink cartridge <b>2</b> is further pushed toward the printing apparatus, the ink supply needle <b>104</b> is guided by the tapered portion <b>58</b> to contact with the center of the convex surface <b>45</b> of the valve member <b>10</b>. Under this condition, the ink supply needle <b>104</b> is inserted into the hole <b>18</b> <i>a </i>of the protruding portion <b>8</b> <i>a </i>of the packing member <b>8</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0172">The valve member <b>10</b> is forced to come out of contact with the packing member <b>8</b> when the ink supply needle <b>104</b> is inserted into the ink supply port <b>6</b> whilst forming the sealed connection with the packing member <b>8</b> as described above. Therefore, the air compressed by the ink supply needle does not enter the ink supply port <b>6</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0173">Further in this embodiment, the ink supply needle <b>104</b> contacts with the center of the spherical convex surface <b>45</b> having a large diameter of curvature, and the valve member <b>10</b> is regulated by its axial portion <b>50</b>, therefore, contact between the valve member <b>10</b> and the ink supply needle <b>104</b> is ensured.</p>
  <p num="p-0174">When, on the other hand, the cartridge <b>2</b> is removed from the printing apparatus, the ink supply needle <b>104</b> is detached from the packing member <b>8</b>. The valve member <b>10</b> is urged toward the packing member <b>8</b> by the elastic force of the compression spring <b>12</b>. The convex surface <b>45</b> of the sealing portion <b>44</b> of the valve member <b>10</b> forms a contact with the protruding portion <b>8</b> <i>a </i>of the packing member <b>8</b>, to close the ink introducing chamber <b>36</b>. This occurs when the ink supply needle <b>104</b> is almost detached from the packing member <b>8</b> but is still forming a sealed connection with the fitting portion <b>28</b> of the packing member <b>8</b>. Thus, the ink does not leak from, and undesirable air bubbles do not enter the external opening <b>14</b>. Furthermore, as the sealing portion <b>44</b> has the spherical convex surface <b>45</b>, the sealed connection between the packing member <b>8</b> and the valve member <b>10</b> is ensured even when the position of the valve member <b>10</b> varies.</p>
  <p num="p-0175">The spherical convex surface <b>45</b> of the valve member <b>10</b> may have a flat surface <b>45</b> <i>c </i>having a diameter smaller than the diameter of the hole <b>18</b> <i>a </i>of the protruding portion <b>8</b> <i>a </i>of the packing member <b>8</b> as shown in FIG. <b>19</b>(B). In this case, the contacting surface between the ink supply needle <b>104</b> and the valve member <b>10</b> is large, to enforce the contact therebetween without reducing the sealed connection between the ink supply needle <b>104</b> and the packing member <b>8</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0176">Furthermore, the closing surface <b>44</b> of the valve member <b>10</b> may be formed as a conical shape <b>45</b> <i>d </i>having its point removed, to leave a flat surface <b>45</b> <i>c </i>remained. In this case, the contact between the ink supply needle <b>104</b> and the valve member <b>10</b> is enforced as well, without reducing the sealed connection between the ink supply needle <b>104</b> and the packing member <b>8</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0177">The elastic member may be an extension spring <b>64</b> as shown in FIG. <b>20</b>. The extension spring <b>64</b> is fixed to the ink cartridge <b>2</b> at an end by the packing member <b>8</b> to have the other end of the extension spring <b>64</b> contact with the valve member <b>10</b>. The valve member <b>10</b> is forced toward the packing member <b>10</b>. In this case, the valve member does not need to have a spring support structure <b>46</b>, and the ink cartridge <b>2</b> does not need to have a guide unit <b>38</b> in the ink introducing chamber <b>36</b>. The result is, that the structure of the ink cartridge <b>2</b> can be simplified, thus, the manufacturing process can be reduced.</p>
  <p num="p-0178"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</figref> shows another example of the valve device according to the present invention. The valve device <b>70</b> has a valve body <b>72</b> to form contact with the packing member <b>8</b>, and an elastic support portion <b>74</b> for supporting the valve body <b>72</b> in order to have the valve body <b>72</b> contact with the packing member <b>8</b>. The elastic support portion <b>74</b> is made of an elastic material such as a hard rubber, a plastic material having a high elastic modulus, or an elastomer material. The elastic support portion <b>74</b> is capable of bending when the ink supply needle <b>104</b> fits with the packing member, to urge the valve body <b>72</b> of the valve device <b>70</b>. The valve body <b>72</b> and the elastic support portion <b>74</b> may be separately formed, or may be formed as one unit. The elastic support portion <b>74</b> of the valve device <b>70</b> urges the valve body <b>72</b> toward the packing member <b>8</b>. At the same time, the valve body <b>72</b> contacts with the packing member <b>8</b>, and guides the valve member vertically with respect to the packing member <b>8</b>. Therefore, the number of parts can be reduced.</p>
  <p num="p-0179">The valve device <b>70</b> may have a plurality of elastic support portions <b>74</b>, for example, three in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, or only one elastic support portion <b>74</b> as shown in FIG. <b>22</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0180">FIGS. <b>23</b>(A) and <b>23</b>(B) show another embodiment of the valve according to the present invention. The valve device <b>80</b> has a valve member <b>82</b> to form a contact with the packing member <b>8</b> and an elastic member <b>84</b> for urging the valve member <b>82</b> toward the packing member <b>8</b> in order to have the valve member <b>82</b> contact with the packing member <b>8</b>. The elastic member <b>84</b> is made of a polymeric elastomer or a rubber capable of expanding.</p>
  <p num="p-0181">The valve body <b>82</b> is urged to selectively contact with the packing member <b>8</b> by the elastic member <b>84</b> connected to the cylindrical recess <b>30</b> of the packing member <b>8</b> in the embodiment shown in FIG. <b>23</b>(A). The valve body <b>82</b> is urged by the ink supply needle <b>104</b> of the printing apparatus toward the ink chamber, to open the valve device <b>80</b>. Thus, the ink is provided from the ink chamber to the print head <b>102</b> of the printing apparatus through the hole of the ink supply needle <b>104</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0182">A part of the valve body <b>82</b> is fixed at the packing member <b>8</b> as shown in FIGS. <b>24</b>(A) and <b>24</b>(B). The valve body <b>82</b> is urged to contact with the packing member <b>8</b> by the elastic member <b>84</b> in this case as well. The valve body <b>84</b> is urged toward the ink chamber by the ink supply needle <b>104</b>, to open the hole of the packing member <b>8</b>. The ink is then provided from the ink chamber to the print head <b>102</b> of the printing apparatus through the hole of the ink supply needle <b>104</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0183">The valve device <b>80</b> maybe formed as one unit with the packing member <b>8</b>. It means that the valve device <b>80</b> is fixed to the packing member <b>8</b> as its part. Thus, the number of parts and manufacturing process can be reduced.</p>
  <p num="p-0184">The valve body <b>40</b> of the valve member <b>10</b> may have a surface facing the packing member provided with a notch as shown in FIGS. <b>25</b>(A) to <b>25</b>(D). The notch <b>40</b> <i>c </i>of the valve body <b>40</b> shown in FIGS. <b>25</b>(A) and <b>25</b>(B) has an angle the same as that of the tapered ink supply needle <b>104</b>. The notch <b>40</b> <i>d </i>of the valve body <b>40</b> shown in FIGS. <b>25</b>(C) and <b>25</b>(D) has an angle smaller than that of the tapered ink supply needle <b>104</b>. These reduce the damage to the ink supply needle <b>104</b> when the ink supply needle <b>104</b> urges the valve member <b>10</b>. In particular, when the ink supply needle <b>104</b> contacts the valve body <b>40</b> as shown in FIGS. <b>25</b>(C) and <b>25</b>(D), the tip end of the ink supply needle <b>104</b> does not contact with the valve body <b>40</b> of the valve member <b>10</b>, therefore the tip end of the ink supply needle <b>104</b> is not damaged.</p>
  <p num="p-0185">The packing member <b>8</b> may have two fitting portions, a first fitting position <b>28</b> <i>a </i>for fitting the ink supply needle of the printing apparatus when the ink supply needle <b>104</b> is inserted from the external opening <b>14</b>, and a second fitting position <b>28</b> <i>b </i>for fitting the ink supply needle <b>104</b> when the ink supply needle <b>104</b> is further inserted toward the ink chamber <b>4</b>. In this case, each of the fitting portions <b>28</b> <i>a </i>and <b>28</b> <i>b </i>fits with the ink supply needle <b>104</b>. Thus, the sealed connection between the packing member and the ink supply needle <b>104</b> can be enforced. Each of the fitting portions <b>28</b> <i>a </i>and <b>28</b> <i>b </i>may be formed with or without a hole. Preferably, the fitting portion <b>28</b> <i>a </i>closer to the external opening <b>14</b> is not formed with a hole and is sealed initially prior to use. In such a case, the number of parts can be reduced because the ink cartridge does not have a sealing film to seal the supply port <b>6</b> prior to use. Even in this case, the fitting portion <b>28</b> <i>a </i>is formed as tapered as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, so the ink supply needle <b>104</b> can smoothly penetrate the sealed fitting portion <b>28</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0186">The ink cartridge according to the present invention may be used as an off-carriage type ink cartridge which is mounted on a fixed part of the body of the printer and connected to the print head which is mounted on the carriage, through a flexible ink supply tube.</p>
  <p num="p-0187">The ink cartridge according to the present invention may also be applied to a printing apparatus in which a heating element is used as a pressurizing means not only to the printing apparatus in which the piezoelectric transducer is used as a pressurizing means of the print head.</p>
  <p num="p-0188">As described above, according to the present invention, an ink cartridge and an ink supply system are capable of closing the ink supply channel when it is not mounted on the printing apparatus and capable of opening the ink supply channel to provide ink to the print head when it is mounted on the printing apparatus. A printing apparatus employing the ink cartridge or the ink supply system is also provided by the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0189">Furthermore, Ink can be supplied from the ink supply port to the ink supply needle without having air or bubble enter the ink supply port because the valve device is urged by the ink supply needle of the printing apparatus to open the ink channel under a state where the ink supply needle is sealed by the packing member.</p>
  <p num="p-0190">Furthermore, the ink supply port can be sealed without having air or bubble enter the ink supply port because the valve device comes to close the ink channel of the packing member before the ink supply needle of the printing apparatus is completely detached from the packing member.</p>
  <p num="p-0191">Furthermore, the ink supply needle can be smoothly inserted in the packing member because the packing member is made of an elastic material and provided with a lubricant coat at least at an area with which the ink supply needle contacts.</p>
  <p num="p-0192">Furthermore, the packing member can seal the ink supply needle because the packing member includes a tapered portion or a fitting portion fitting the ink supply needle.</p>
  <p num="p-0193">Furthermore, the ink supply needle can securely contact with the valve device, because the valve device includes a substantially flat surface with which the ink supply needle contacts.</p>
  <p num="p-0194">Furthermore, the valve body can be moved substantially vertically with respect to the packing member because the valve device includes a guide body for guiding the valve body to slide substantially vertically with respect to the packing member.</p>
  <p num="p-0195">Furthermore, manufacturing process can be simplified and reduced because the number of parts or components necessary for assembling the ink cartridge according to the present invention is reduced.</p>
