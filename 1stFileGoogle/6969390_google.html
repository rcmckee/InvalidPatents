    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="p-0004">The present invention relates generally to implants, method, and instrumentation for fusion of the human cervical spine from the anterior aspect, and in particular to plate systems for aligning and maintaining adjacent cervical vertebrae in a selected spatial relationship during spinal fusion of those vertebrae.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="p-0006">It is current practice in the art to use cervical plating systems for this purpose. Such systems are composed essentially of plates and screws for aligning and holding vertebrae in a desired position relative to one another. The earliest such devices consisted of stainless steel plates and screws and required that the screws passed entirely through the vertebrae and into the spinal canal in order to engage the strong bone tissue (the posterior cortex) of the vertebral bodies. This required the ability to observe or visualize this area radiographically, which is not always possible, especially in the lower cervical spine where the vertebrae may be hidden radiographically by the shoulders.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">In order to form holes in the vertebral bodies for insertion of each screw, a drilling operation was performed, followed by a tapping operation. Each of these operations involved the passage of an instrument entirely through the associated vertebral body and into the spinal column. Thus, these instruments come into close proximity to the spinal cord and the dural sac which are in close proximity to the back surfaces of the vertebral bodies. Any procedure which introduces an object into the spinal canal presents serious risks which are of concern to the surgeon.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">The conventional technique of forming a bone screw receiving hole in vertebral bodies by drilling has a number of significant disadvantages. For example, drilling removes bone material, leaving a void and resulting in a loss of bone material. Drilling also causes microfracturing of the bone at the drill bit-bone interface and the resulting fracture lines tend to propagate in directions perpendicular to the wall of the hole. More specifically, the bone material is essentially a type of ceramic which exhibits a brittle pattern of fracture formation and propagation in response to drilling. Furthermore, drilling generates heat which can result in thermal necrosis of the bone material precisely at the interface between the bone and a subsequently installed screw, where necrosis is most harmful. Any bone which does experience necrosis will subsequently be resorbed by the body as part of the bone repair process and this can lead to the loosening of the screw.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">Another problem with drilling is that the path of the drill bit is difficult to control and since the drill bit operates by rotation, it can wind up soft tissue about the associated plate. In addition, unless great care is taken, the drill bit may be driven significantly past the posterior cortex and cause irreparable harm within the spinal canal. Finally, a drill bit may bind and fracture within the vertebral body and can then cause serious injury as the still rotating portion of the drill bit passes into the wound, while the portion of the bit which has broken off may either protrude dangerously from the vertebral body or may be broken off flush with the upper surface of the body so as to be irretrievably embedded therein. In any event, the steps that must be taken to retrieve the broken-off portion of a drill bit will inevitably prolong and complicate the surgical procedure.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">In known plating systems, there have been problems with loosening and failure of the hardware, breakage of the screws and plates, and backing out of screws into the patient's throat area. These occurrences generally require further surgical procedures to replace the broken parts or the plates and screws entirely, and to repair any damage that may have been caused.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">Other problems which have been encountered with known systems result from the failure of the screws to achieve a sufficient purchase in the bone and the stripping of the screws. Also, the use of the known plating systems may result in a loss of lordosis, which is the normal curve of the cervical spine when viewed from the side.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">Known plating systems additionally experience problems in connection with those procedures where bone grafts are placed between vertebral bodies to achieve an interbody fusion which heals by a process called “creeping substitution”. In this process, bone at the interface between the graft and a vertebra is removed by a biological process which involves the production of powerful acids and enzymes, as a prelude to invasion of the interface by living tissue and the deposition, or growth, of new bone. While the plates allow for proper alignment of the vertebrae and their rigid fixation, they can therefore, at the same time unfortunately, hold the vertebrae apart while the resorption phase of the creeping substitution process forms gaps in the bone at the fusion site with the result that the desired fusion does not occur. Such failure is known as pseudoarthrosis. When such a failure occurs, the hardware itself will usually break or become loosened from the spine, thus requiring a further surgical procedure to remove the broken components and another surgical procedure to again attempt fusion.</p>
    <p num="p-0013">In response to the problems described above, a second generation of plating systems has been developed and/or proposed. These include a system disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,364,399 to Lowery and 5,423,826 to Morscher, as well as cervical spine locking plating systems offered by SYNTHES Spine, the DANEK ORION plate, the CODMAN SHURTLEFF plate, and the SMITH NEPHEW RICHARDS plate, among others. The systems' forming members of this second generation have a number of common properties. They are all made of either a titanium alloy or pure titanium rather than stainless steel, to minimize adverse tissue reactions and are MRI compatible, which stainless steel is not. The screws and the plates have been given increased thickness in order to achieve increased strength. The screws have larger diameters to improve their purchase without requiring that they engage the posterior cortex of the vertebral bodies. Some mild longitudinal contouring of the plates is employed to allow for some lordosis, and/or limited transverse contouring to better follow the generally curved aspect of the front of the vertebral bodies. Mechanisms are employed for securing the vertebral bone screws to their associated plates in a manner to prevent the screws from backing out. While this second generation of plating systems represents a significant improvement over earlier systems, certain existing problems persist, while new problems have been created.</p>
    <p num="p-0014">For example, since the screws no longer extend into the posterior cortex, it is common for the threads in the tapped screw hole to become stripped and for the screws to fail to gain a suitable purchase. In addition, screw breakage continues to be experienced and occurs most commonly at the junction of the screw to the posterior aspect of the plate. The screws employed in both the SYNTHES system and the SMITH NEPHEW RICHARDS system are particularly vulnerable to this problem because those screws are hollow at the level where they attach to the plate to permit the internal reception of locking screws.</p>
    <p num="p-0015">In an attempt to prevent screw to plate junction breakage of the screw, more recent designs of screws have an increasing root diameter from tip to head, which thus far has resulted in a near useless stubby and blunt thread near the screw head with little holding power and little tactile feedback to the surgeon to signal the completion of tightening prior to stripping of the screw within the bone. Based on empiric studies testing these prior art screws, the use of a pretapped hole, rather than a self-tapping screw, was found to be preferred for pullout strength and thus these screws have not been self-tapping and thus the screw holes must be pre-tapped. Since the thread cutting portion of a tap is necessarily sharp and rotated to work, there is a serious risk of damage to the surrounding soft tissues when it is used. This is compounded by the fact that the plates employed in these systems do not provide sufficient long axis contouring to make full allowance for lordosis and do not have sufficient transverse contouring to prevent rocking of the plate about its longitudinal axis and to conform to the anterior shape of the vertebral bodies, so that these plates do not prevent soft tissue from creeping in from the sides and beneath the screw holes thus exposing these tissues to damage by the drill and the tap. While it is possible, at the time of surgery, to make some change in the contouring of these plates, this is generally limited to contouring of the longitudinal axis and quite often causes distortion of the plate's bone screw holes and screw hole to plate junctions in a manner which has an adverse effect on the screw-plate interlock. Lack of proper contouring prevents these plates from having an optimally low profile relative to the spine.</p>
    <p num="p-0016">In some of the second generation cervical plating systems, screw backout continues to occur, because these plates could not be designed to allow for the locking of all of the screws. Specifically, while the designers of these plates recognized the importance of securing the bone screws to the plates, they were unable to lock all of the screws and had to settle for leaving some of the screws unlocked.</p>
    <p num="p-0017">Furthermore, several of these second generation systems utilize tiny and delicate “watchmaker” parts to achieve interlocking. These parts are characterized by the need to engage them with particularly delicate small ended screw drivers. These interlocking components are easily rendered ineffective by any effort to alter the contours of a plate during surgery.</p>
    <p num="p-0018">Despite the improvement of these second generation plating systems over the first problems, the problems still persist, the most important of which is pseudoarthroses, and particularly “distraction pseudoarthroses”. Although these second generation plates have clearly led to an increase in fusion rate, when a failure to produce fusion occurs, it is generally accompanied by bone resorption along a line at the graft-to-vertebra junction, which can be seen on a radiograph.</p>
    <p num="p-0019">In the case of the weak first generation plates and screws, the plates might hold the vertebrae apart, preventing fusion, but only until the hardware would break, relieving the distraction, and then allowing the fusion to occur. The second generation systems of plates are too strong to allow this to occur, thus requiring further surgical procedures for the correction of the pseudoarthroses.</p>
    <p num="p-0020">Compression plates are well known and are widely used in orthopedic surgery for the stabilization of tubular bones, and sometimes also flat bones. Such plates may rely on some external compression means or may be self-compressing, relying on the ability of the screw head to slide within a ramped slot such that the tightening of the bone screws through the plate imparts a linear motion perpendicular to the screw axes. U.S. Pat. No. 5,180,381 discloses an attempt to employ such a mechanism in connection with anterior spinal fixation.</p>
    <p num="p-0021">However, it has been found that all of the proposed self-compressing plating systems have in common the need for a screw to engage both a proximal and a distal cortex, (bone casing of very dense bone material), so as to anchor the screw tip in a manner to allow the plate to move relative to the screw when tightened rather than allowing the plate to drag the screw off axis. However, as already discussed earlier herein, when a screw is to engage the posterior cortex of the vertebral body, it is necessary for the drill and the tap which form the screw hole, as well as the screw tip itself, to all enter the spinal canal, thereby exposing the spinal cord to damage.</p>
    <p num="p-0022">While the system disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,180,381 avoids such danger by engaging the vertebral body end plate instead of the posterior vertebral body cortex, the path of the screw is of necessity quite short, so that there is very little opportunity for the screw threads to achieve additional purchase within the vertebral body. It would therefore appear that to the extent that the device disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,180,380 is able to achieve its stated objectives, it would pull the front of the spine together more than the back and would not appear to compress the back of the vertebral bodies at all, thus producing an undesirable iatrogenic loss of the normal cervical lordosis. Such a situation is disruptive to the normal biomechanics of the cervical spine and potentially quite harmful.</p>
    <p num="p-0023">The creation of compression between adjacent vertebrae would offer a number of advantages, including reduced distraction pseudoarthrosis, increased surface area of contact between the graft and vertebrae as slightly incongruent surfaces are forced together, increased osteogenic stimulation, since compressive loads stimulate bone formation, and increased fusion graft and spinal segment stability.</p>
    <p num="p-0024">Among the new problems created by these second generation systems is a tendency for the small “watchmaker” parts used to lock the bone screws to the plate to fall off of the driver used for attaching those parts, or out of the associated plates and to become lost in the wound. In addition, these small parts are quite fragile and require specialized additional instruments for their insertion and/or manipulation. Furthermore, incorrect bone screw placement relative to the axis of a plate hole may render the screw locking mechanism unworkable or may cause sharp and jagged shavings of titanium to be formed as a locking screw is driven into contact with an improperly seated bone screw. The means for establishing bone screw to plate hole alignment and preparation are less than reliable. Furthermore, most of these second generation systems lack a reliable and effective means for positioning and holding the plate during attachment.</p>
    <p num="p-0025">Specific features of various prior art systems will be summarized below.</p>
    <p num="p-0026">The system disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,364,399 and 5,423,826, cited earlier herein, includes a thin stainless steel plate which allows for side-by-side or offset bicortical screw placement, the plate having a combination of screw holes and slots.</p>
    <p num="p-0027">The “Acromed” system includes a titanium plate and screws which require bicortical screw placement. This system does not include any locking means for the bone screws.</p>
    <p num="p-0028">The system disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,180,381 includes an “H” shaped plate having a combination of ramped slots and a hole which requires bicortical screw placement at a 45N angle to the plane of the plate. This patent discloses that this angular positioning is for the purpose of producing compression.</p>
    <p num="p-0029">The SYNTHES Morscher plate system employs hollow, slotted screw heads. The screws are placed unicortically so that the heads, when properly aligned, come to rest in the upper portion of the plate holes. The upper portion of each screw is internally threaded to receive a tiny screw which is screwed into the bone screw head in order to increase the interference fit between the bone screw head and the wall of the associated plate hole.</p>
    <p num="p-0030">In the system disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,364,399 and 5,423,826, use is made of pairs of unicortical bone screws that may be locked in place at both ends of the associated plate by locking screws which have a small diameter shank and a large head. At each end of a plate two bone screws may be locked in place by a single locking screw which is situated between the bone screws. Generally, the plate is provided, between its two ends, with a diagonal slot or slots for receiving one or more additional screws, each additional screw being securable in a bone graft or a respective vertebra which is spanned by the plate. There is no locking screw associated with these intermediate bone screws to lock the bone screws to the plate.</p>
    <p num="p-0031">The Codman Shurtleff plating system utilizes the side of a preinstalled rivet having a head rotatable to press against the side of the head of a bone screw so as to secure that one screw to the plate. The plates of this system also are provided with holes for receiving intermediate screws, but these screws are not associated with any locking means.</p>
    <p num="p-0032">While the designers of the last-mentioned systems recognized the importance of locking the bone screws in position on their associated plates, they did not provide for any locking of the intermediate bone screws in their associated holes.</p>
    <p num="p-0033">In an earlier version of the Codman Shurtleff system, the locking mechanism was a lever pivotable about a shaft passing entirely through the plate and then flared so as to retain the shaft within the plate. The lever was rotated after the bone screw had been inserted to engage the head of the bone screw and thus secure the bone screw to the plate.</p>
    <p num="p-0034">Based on a consideration of the features of all of the known cervical plating systems, it appears that there remains a need for an improved system having the following combination of features:

    <p num="p-0047">It is another object of the present invention to provide instruments for reliably and easily performing the installation of the plates of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0048">It is still another object of the present invention to provide an improved method of installing the plates of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0049">The above and other objects and features of the invention will become more readily apparent from the following description of preferred embodiments of the invention, provided with reference to the accompanying drawings, which illustrate embodiments of the invention solely by way of non-limiting example.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0050">The plating system of the first preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises a plate having a length sufficient to span a disc space and to overlap, at least in part, at least two adjacent cervical vertebrae, a substantial portion of the lower surface of the plate preferably being biconcave, that is concave curved along a substantial portion of the longitudinal axis of the plate and concave curved along a substantial portion of the transverse axis of the plate. The lower surface of the plate may also textured and/or treated to induce bone growth along the lower surface of the plate which contacts the cervical vertebrae. The plate is provided with a plurality of bone screw receiving holes which extend through the plate, from the upper surface to the lower surface of the plate, and at least one locking element is associated with the bone screw receiving hole. The plate and its component parts, may be made of any implant quality material suitable for use in the human body, and the plate and associated component may be made of a bioresorbable material.</p>
    <p num="p-0051">Bone screws are each insertable into a respective bone screw receiving hole for attaching the plate to a vertebra. A locking element, is engageable to a locking element receiving recess and has a head formed to lock the bone screws to the plate. In the preferred embodiment, a single locking element locks a number of different bone screws in place. The locking elements are pre-installed prior to use by the surgeon in a manner so as to not impede installation of the bone screws.</p>
    <p num="p-0052">As a result, the problems previously associated with the locking screws of the type applied after the insertion of the bone screws, including the problems of instrumentation to position and deliver to the plate the locking means, backing out, breakage, stripping and misthreading associated with the prior art more delicate locking screws resembling “watchmaker's parts”, are eliminated.</p>
    <p num="p-0053">In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, a locking element fits within a respective bone screw receiving hole to lock a respective one of the bone screws in place. According to this second embodiment of the invention, each of the bone screws is locked to the plate by means of an individual locking element which bears against at least a portion of the bone screw. Since no other holes need be formed in the plate to attach the locks to the plate, the plate remains quite strong.</p>
    <p num="p-0054">The locking elements can be in many forms to achieve their intended purpose, such as, but not limited to, screws, threaded caps, rivets, set screws, projecting elements, and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0055">Also, a novel bone screw is disclosed so as to prevent pulling out of the bone screw during use. This is achieved by a design which includes a screw in which the outer diameter or crest diameter of the thread is maintained substantially constant along the entire length of the shaft of the bone screw, from below the head to above the tip, where threads of a lesser outer diameter facilitate insertion. The screw tip is fluted at its distal end to be self-tapping. The thread also has an extremely thin and sharp profile to cut into and preserve the integrity of the vertebral bone stock.</p>
    <p num="p-0056">The plating system does not require that the head of the bone screw be hollow, or that additional holes be placed through the plate in addition to those provided for the passage of the bone screws. It will be appreciated that bone screws are weakened when their heads are hollow and that plates are weakened when they are provided with additional holes.</p>
    <p num="p-0057">Additionally, the plate of the disclosed systems permit the proper aligning of the holes in the plate for the bone screws and for the plate to be easily applied to the vertebrae in compression. The plates include appropriate slots and engagement means for engaging compression instrumentation, described in detail below, for applying a compression force between adjacent vertebrae to which the plate is attached, in a reliable and easy manner.</p>
    <p num="p-0058">An improved locking screw driver is provided. The driver provides for a wedged interference fit with a recess in the head of the bone screws and the head of the locking elements. The same driver is usable for both bone screws and locking elements. The driver ensures that the locking element cannot fall off the driver and become lost in the wound. The driver has a tapered end to facilitate insertion into the complimentary recess in the head of the screws and is used to engage and pick up the locking elements. Alternatively, the receiving socket can be tapered to the same purpose.</p>
    <p num="p-0059">Alternatively, a combination bone screw and locking screw driver is disclosed in which the bone screw driver passes through a longitudinal opening in the locking screw driver so that both the bone screw and the locking screw can be loaded prior to insertion of the bone screw and both can be tightened with one instrument, without removing it from position.</p>
    <p num="p-0060">Also, instruments are provided for forming pilot holes to assist in the ease and accuracy of the installment of the bone screws, and for creating a creating a compression force between adjacent vertebrae during installation of the plate and for holding the plate during installation.</p>

This is referred to as the multiple locking plate system. The multiple locking plates will be described, then the locking elements for locking the bone screws to the plate, then the bone screws associated with the multiple locking plates, and finally the instrumentation and method of installation of the multiple locking plates. Thereafter the plate systems in which a single locking element locks a single bone screw will be described. This is referred to as the single locking plate system. The locking elements, bone screws, instrumentation, and method of installation associated with the single locking plate will then be discussed.</p>
    <p num="h-0007">1. Multiple Locking Plate System</p>
    <p num="p-0148">The preferred embodiment of the multiple locking anterior cervical locking plate <b>2</b> according to the present invention (here shown by way of example for use in a two level fusion (three adjacent vertebrae)) is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–5</figref>. Plate <b>2</b> has a generally elongated form whose outline generally departs from rectangular due to the presence of lobes or lateral projections <b>4</b> at the corners and at the center of the sides of plate <b>2</b>. Each lobe <b>4</b> has a rounded outline and contains a respective circular bone screw receiving hole <b>6</b>. Two additional intermediate circular bone screw receiving holes <b>8</b> are located inwardly of the sides of plate <b>2</b> and are centered on the longitudinal center line of plate <b>2</b>. Lobes <b>4</b> give plate <b>2</b> additional strength in the region surrounding each bone screw receiving hole <b>6</b>. It is recognized that other shapes for the plate <b>2</b> may be employed.</p>
    <p num="p-0149">The intermediate paired bone screw receiving holes <b>8</b> are for use with a two level (three vertebrae) fusion. The intermediate bone screw receiving holes <b>8</b> may be eliminated for a single level (two vertebrae) fusion, or additional intermediate bone screw receiving holes <b>8</b> may be added if additional levels are to be fused.</p>
    <p num="p-0150">Plate <b>2</b> is further provided with three locking element holes <b>12</b>, each of which in the preferred embodiment is internally threaded <b>3</b>, and each of which is surrounded by a shallow countersunk region <b>14</b>. As will be described in greater detail below, in the preferred embodiment, bone screws are inserted in the bone screw receiving holes and a single pre-installed locking element associated with each of the locking element holes <b>12</b> locks a number of bone screws <b>30</b> in position at one time.</p>
    <p num="p-0151">The number of paired bone screw holes generally correspond to the number of vertebrae to be fused. A plate for a one level fusion could have but a single locking element hole <b>12</b>, while plates for fusing more than two levels (three vertebrae) could have additional middle locking element holes <b>12</b> corresponding to additional paired bone screw holes. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–6</figref>, each end locking element <b>20</b> will lock three bone screws <b>30</b> in place, while the locking screw <b>21</b> in the central locking hole <b>12</b> locks two bone screws <b>30</b> in place. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, central locking element <b>25</b> can also be configured so that four bone screws <b>30</b> are locked at one time.</p>
    <p num="p-0152">As shown particularly in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, plate <b>2</b> is shaped so that its bottom surface <b>27</b> (the surface which will be in contact with the vertebral bodies) has a biconcave curvature, being concave both in the longitudinal plane (corresponding to its length) and in the plane transverse thereto, corresponding to its width. The concave curvature in the longitudinal plane conforms to the proper shape of the anterior aspect of the spine with the vertebrae aligned in appropriate lordosis. That longitudinal curve is an arc along the circumference of a circle (referred to herein as the “radius of curvature”) 15.0 cm to 30.0 cm in radius and more preferably 20.0–25.0 cm in radius. Viewed on end in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the plate <b>2</b> has a radius of curvature of a circle 15–25 mm in radius, but preferably 19–21 mm in radius. While the plate <b>2</b> may have a thickness between 2 to 3 mm, a thickness of between 2.25 and 2.5 mm is preferred.</p>
    <p num="p-0153">Having the bottom surface <b>27</b> of plate <b>2</b> contoured so that it is able to lie flush against the associated vertebral bodies is in contrast to conventional plates which have larger radii of curvature that contact the vertebral bodies only along the longitudinal centerline of the plate, thereby permitting side-to-side rocking of the plate relative to the vertebral bodies. The contour of the plate of the present invention provides effective resistance to rocking of the plate <b>2</b> relative to the vertebral bodies about the longitudinal center line of the plate, thereby reducing stress on the plate <b>2</b> and bone screws <b>30</b>, and preventing the soft tissues from becoming engaged beneath the plate.</p>
    <p num="p-0154">Other advantages produced by the above curvature are that the plate <b>2</b> will conform more closely to the facing bone surface; the plate <b>2</b> will project from the spine by a smaller distance; soft tissue will be prevented from sliding underneath the edges of the plate <b>2</b>, where it could be subject to damage; and the angle of the bone screws <b>30</b>, perpendicular to the plate when viewed from the side, when installed will be at a substantial converging angle, trapping the vertebral bone between the bone screws <b>30</b>, and thus more strongly anchoring the plate to the spine.</p>
    <p num="p-0155">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the bottom surface <b>27</b> of plate <b>2</b>, preferably has a porous, roughened, and/or textured surface layer and may be coated with, impregnated with, or comprise of fusion promoting substances (such as bone morphogenetic proteins) so as to encourage the growth of bone along the underside of the plate <b>2</b> from vertebrae to vertebrae. The textured bottom surface <b>27</b> also provides a medium for retaining fusion promoting substances with which the bottom surface <b>27</b> layer can be impregnated prior to installation. The bottom surface <b>27</b> of plate <b>2</b> may be given the desired porous textured form by rough blasting or any other conventional technology, such as etching, plasma spraying, sintering, and casting for example. If porous, the bottom surface <b>27</b> is formed to have a porosity or pore size in the order of 50–500 microns, and preferably 100–300 microns. Fusion promoting substances with which the porous, textured bottom surface <b>27</b> can be impregnated include, but are not limited to, bone morphogenetic proteins, hydroxyapatite, or hydroxyapatite tricalcium phosphate. The plate <b>2</b> may comprise of at least in part a resorbable material which can further be impregnated with the bone growth material so that as the plate <b>2</b> is resorbed by the body of the patient, the bone growth material is released, thus acting as a time release mechanism. Having the plate <b>2</b> being made from a material that is resorbable and having bone growth promoting material present permits the vertebrae to be fused in a more natural manner as the plate becomes progressively less load bearing thereby avoiding late stress shielding of the spine.</p>
    <p num="p-0156">As further shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, at least one end of plate <b>2</b> has a recess <b>18</b> that can cooperate with a compression apparatus, described in detail later in reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 38</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0157"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a top plan view of the plate <b>2</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with locking elements <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> inserted into the locking element receiving holes. In the preferred embodiment, the locking elements <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> are in the form of screws that cooperate with the threaded interior <b>3</b> of the locking holes <b>12</b>. Each of these locking elements <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> is shown in its initial open orientation, where the orientation of the cutouts <b>22</b> in the head <b>23</b> of each locking element <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> is oriented so as to permit introduction of bone screws <b>30</b> into adjacent bone screw receiving holes <b>6</b>,<b>8</b> without interference by the head <b>23</b> of the locking element <b>20</b>, <b>21</b>. It is appreciated that other configurations of the head <b>23</b> are possible so as to permit introduction of bone screw into adjacent bone screw receiving holes without interference by the head <b>23</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0158"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a top view of another embodiment of plate <b>2</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–5</figref>, and is generally referred to as plate <b>120</b>. Plate <b>120</b> is provided with a longitudinally extending elongated slot <b>122</b> along its longitudinal axis which is superimposed on the middle locking hole <b>12</b>. Elongated slot <b>122</b> allows additional relative movement between plate <b>120</b> and a compression post <b>54</b> associated with a compression tool during the compression procedure, as discussed below.</p>
    <p num="p-0159">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, an alternative embodiment of a multiple locking plate referred to by the number <b>70</b> is shown. In plate <b>70</b>, rather than the threaded locking hole <b>12</b>, a central opening <b>200</b> for receiving a removable rivet <b>202</b>, of the type shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17–20</figref>, is provided. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a bottom plan view of the plate <b>70</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The contour of the plate <b>70</b> is the same as that of the plate <b>2</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–5</figref>. The rivet <b>202</b> is removable and fits within the unthreaded opening <b>200</b>, comparable to the locking hole <b>12</b> and slot <b>122</b> described above. Other embodiments may employ a rivet that is not removable, but is manufactured as part of the plate <b>70</b> as would be used in the end locking holes <b>19</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0160">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, another alternative embodiment of a multiple locking plate is shown and is generally referred to by the number <b>230</b>. The plate <b>230</b> uses threaded caps, such as cap <b>300</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 23</figref>, for a locking element or preferably one with cut outs as described having an appearance in a top view such as the locking element in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10–11</figref>, for example. The central locking hole <b>232</b> has an elongated slot <b>234</b> for providing an increased compression capability, as will be discussed further herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0161">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10–13</figref>, a first embodiment of a locking element <b>20</b>, <b>21</b>, <b>25</b> in the form of locking screws according to the present invention for use with plate <b>2</b> is shown. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a top plan view which illustrates the head <b>23</b> of the central locking element <b>25</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The shaft <b>46</b> of locking element <b>25</b> is threaded <b>47</b> to mate with the threading <b>3</b> within the associated locking hole <b>12</b> of plate <b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, each segment <b>49</b> on each side of cutouts <b>22</b> of the locking element <b>21</b> has a bearing surface <b>48</b> formed at the lower surface of locking element head <b>23</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the locking element head <b>23</b> can be provided with two slots <b>42</b> for providing flexibility to the locking element head <b>23</b> to assist in the locking element's ability to ride over the top of the bone screw head <b>32</b> during the bearing action when the locking element is rotated. Alternatively, it is appreciated that the bearing surface can be cammed, ramped or wedged. The cammed, ramped or wedged features can also be used with the other locking elements described herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0162">Referring to FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>10</b>–<b>13</b>, it will be appreciated that when the locking elements <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> are rotated in the clockwise direction with respect to the view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a respective bearing surface <b>48</b> (as best seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>) will ride upon the curved top surface <b>39</b> of a respective bone screw head <b>32</b> in order to positively lock the associated bone screws <b>30</b> and the locking elements <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> in place.</p>
    <p num="p-0163">Alternatively, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> in place of a bearing surface <b>48</b>, a ramp or wedge shaped surface <b>44</b> may be used to increase the force applied to the bone screw head <b>32</b>. When locked, the leading end of the ramped portion of the locking element would be lower than the prominence of the bone screw head <b>32</b> so that more force is needed to lift the locking element and untighten it than is needed for the locking element to remain tight and locked. However, the locking element heads <b>23</b> need not have slots, be cammed, or have a ramped surface to achieve the locking of the bone screw <b>30</b> in place. Pressure, friction, interference fits, or other engagement means capable of preventing the locking element from moving from its locked position may be employed.</p>
    <p num="p-0164">The rivet <b>202</b>, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17–20</figref> is intended for use in association with plate <b>70</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14–15</figref>, is shown in detail in cross section in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>. The rivet <b>202</b> has a head <b>204</b>, a shaft <b>206</b>, and an elongated bottom segment <b>208</b> for fitting within the corresponding opening <b>200</b> in the plate <b>70</b>. The lower surface <b>210</b> of the head <b>204</b> of the rivet <b>202</b> has an irregular surface which may be cammed, such as on the bottom of locking element <b>20</b>, <b>21</b>, for engaging the top surface <b>39</b> of the bone screw head <b>32</b>. For use in the end locking holes <b>19</b>, the upper surface of the elongated bottom segment <b>208</b> can have an irregular surface for cooperating with the irregular surface of the bottom of the plate <b>70</b> to hold the rivet <b>202</b> in the locked position against the bone screw head <b>32</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. While the rivet of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a separate, removable component from the plate, the rivets, and particularly those for use with the end locking holes, can be formed as part of the plate during the manufacturing process of the plate and rivet can be non-removable.</p>
    <p num="p-0165">Each of the above embodiments provides tight attachment of the locking element relative the bone screw <b>30</b> and relevant plate.</p>
    <p num="p-0166">In the alternative embodiment of multiple locking plate <b>23</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the locking element can be in the form of threaded locking cap <b>300</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. The threaded locking cap <b>300</b> has a thread <b>302</b> on its outer circumference corresponding to the thread <b>303</b> on the inner circumference of the locking element depressions <b>304</b> in the top of the plate <b>230</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. The locking cap <b>300</b> is relatively thin, particularly compared to its width. The top <b>305</b> of locking cap <b>300</b> is provided with a noncircular through hole <b>306</b> for receiving a similarly configured driving tool.</p>
    <p num="p-0167">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28</figref>, <b>29</b>, and <b>30</b> another embodiment of the multiple locking plate generally referred to by the number <b>400</b> and a locking element in the form of a thin locking member <b>412</b> are shown. Plate <b>400</b> has an opening in its top surface for insertion of the thin locking member <b>412</b>, a recess <b>402</b> associated with each of the bone screw receiving holes <b>408</b> and a slot <b>410</b> in the side wall of the bone screw receiving holes <b>408</b> to permit the thin locking member <b>412</b>, having a series of thin projections or blades <b>414</b>, thinner than the slot <b>410</b>, that give this locking member <b>412</b> an appearance similar to that of a propeller. The thin locking member <b>412</b> is able to be rotated within the plate so as to not cover the bone screw holes, thus allowing the thin locking member <b>412</b> to be pre-installed prior to the installation of the bone screws by the surgeon. Limited rotation of the thin locking member <b>412</b> allows the blades <b>414</b> to protrude through the slot <b>410</b> and to cover a portion of the top of the associated bone screws <b>30</b>. The blades <b>414</b> of the thin locking member <b>412</b> are flexible and, when rotated, slide over the top surface <b>39</b> of the bone screw head <b>32</b> to lock the bone screw <b>30</b> in place. As with the other embodiments discussed, each of the embodiments of the locking element is capable of locking more than one bone screw <b>30</b>. It is appreciated that the various multiple locking plates and locking element combinations are capable of locking as many as four bone screws at once, but are equally effective for locking a lesser number or none at all, that is securing itself to the plate.</p>
    <p num="p-0168">It will be noted that one characteristic of each of the above described locking element embodiments is to have a driver engagement means, in these cases for example, a recess <b>24</b> as large as the recess <b>34</b> in the bone screws <b>30</b> so that the same tool can be used to turn both the bone screws <b>30</b> and the locking elements. Also, the locking elements are sufficiently strong and have sufficient mass so as to be able to withstand being locked without breakage.</p>
    <p num="p-0169">All of the shown examples of the multiple locking elements that have a number of cutout portions have an arc with a radius greater than that of the bone screw head. In addition, the head <b>23</b> of each locking element <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> is provided at its center with a noncircular recess <b>24</b>, such as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> which is engageable by an appropriate manipulation tool, such as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40–42</figref>. In the embodiment of head <b>23</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the associated tool would have a hex head, but as discussed with regard to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 80 and 81</figref>, other shapes of recesses in the head <b>23</b> may be used. The thread of each locking hole <b>12</b> and of each locking element <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> has a close tolerance so that they will reliably retain their orientations so as to permit introduction of bone screws <b>30</b> into bone screw receiving holes <b>6</b>, <b>8</b> without interference.</p>
    <p num="p-0170">It is appreciated that while various forms of locking elements have been disclosed, in light of the teaching, other equivalent means can be used for the purpose of locking the bone screws <b>30</b> in place. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 83</figref>, an alternative multiple locking plate <b>990</b> is shown having additional intermediate bone screw receiving holes <b>980</b> and associated locking elements <b>960</b> for locking bone screws <b>30</b> in place. Plate <b>990</b> allows for a more close spacing and more pairs of bone screw holes than the number of vertebrae to be engaged.</p>
    <p num="p-0171">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 84A–84E</figref> various plates <b>700</b> <i>a–g </i>used for a single level fusion are shown. Each of these plates <b>700</b> <i>a–g </i>is designed to span one spinal segment consisting of one disc space and two adjacent vertebrae (containing the bone graft), and have bone screws inserted into the end of the vertebrae through the bone screw receiving holes <b>6</b> associated with the two adjacent vertebrae and then locked in place. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 84A–84E</figref>, one locking element <b>710</b>, or two locking elements can be used to lock four bone screws in place. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 84A–84E</figref>, each of the plates <b>700</b> <i>a–e </i>is shown with the locking elements in their open orientation, before being rotated to lock the bone screws.</p>
    <p num="p-0172">Each of the above described plates can have the same generally biconcave contour as already described for conforming to the anterior aspect of the spine.</p>
    <p num="p-0173"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A and 24B</figref> provide a side view of one embodiment of a bone screw <b>30</b> according to the present invention. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> is a top view of the bone screw <b>30</b>. At the center of bone screw head <b>32</b> is a profiled recess <b>34</b> which may have the same form as the recess <b>24</b> of each locking element <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> in which case it may be turned with the same tool as that employed for turning locking elements <b>20</b>, <b>21</b>. It is appreciated that the driver engaging portion of the bone screw <b>30</b> could be slotted, and be either male or female (as is shown).</p>
    <p num="p-0174">In the embodiment of bone screw <b>30</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A and 24B</figref>, the bone screw head <b>32</b> is stepped, with the first lower head portion <b>35</b> being contiguous with the screw shank <b>33</b> and has a smaller diameter than the upper portion of the bone screw head <b>32</b>. When this embodiment of bone screw <b>30</b> is employed, each bone screw receiving hole <b>6</b>, <b>8</b> of the plate <b>2</b> has a countersunk region <b>14</b> matching the diameter of the upper portion of the bone screw head <b>32</b> and dimensioned for an interference fit. The lower portion <b>35</b> of the bone screw head <b>32</b> is dimensioned to achieve an interference fit with its associated portion of bone screw receiving holes <b>6</b>, <b>8</b>. The larger diameter upper portion of bone screw head <b>32</b> assures that the bone screw <b>30</b> cannot be advanced completely through bone screw receiving holes <b>6</b>, <b>8</b> of plate <b>2</b>. The bone screw <b>30</b> passes completely through the upper surface of the plate <b>2</b> without engaging the upper surface in any way.</p>
    <p num="p-0175">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>, the head <b>32</b> of screw <b>30</b> passes unobstructed through the upper surface of the plate until the lower surface of enlarged screw head <b>32</b> engages the upper face of the narrowed bone screw receiving portion at the midsubstance or below the midsubstance of the plate. This is considered optimal for allowing for the greatest screw to plate stability, even absent the lock, against all forces except those reverse the path of insertion, while still providing for the greatest plate strength beneath the bone screw head <b>23</b>. That is, since the plate is of only generally 2–3 mm in thickness, a sheer vertical circumferential wall is best able to constrain the motion of a screw if the head is similarly configured and there is little tolerance between them. Placing the support of the head near the mid thickness of the plate is preferred as it allows the head to remain large to accommodate the recess for the driver without being weakened, while placing the support of the head away from the upper surface of the plate allows the screw head to be deep into the plate. Placing the support of the head at approximately the mid thickness of the plate assures plenty of plate material beneath the head to support while providing adequate head length above and below the contact point to prevent the contact point from acting as a fulcrum by providing adequate lever arms to prevent unwanted motion.</p>
    <p num="p-0176">In the alternative embodiment of bone screw <b>30</b>′, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, bone screw head <b>32</b>′ is tapered in the direction from the top of the bone screw head <b>32</b>′ toward screw tip <b>36</b>′. Again, the bone screw head <b>32</b>′ is dimensioned to achieve an interference fit in the associated bone screw receiving hole <b>6</b>,<b>8</b> when the bone screw <b>30</b>′ has been fully installed. When this embodiment of bone screw <b>30</b>′ is employed, bone screw receiving holes <b>6</b>, <b>8</b> need not be provided with a countersunk region <b>4</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0177">In each of the above embodiments of the bone screws, the bone screws <b>30</b> and <b>30</b>′ present a unique combination of a tapered screw shaft <b>33</b> and a helical thread <b>31</b>. The diameter of screw shaft <b>33</b> generally increases from a distal portion of the shaft near the screw tip <b>36</b> toward the proximal portion of the shaft near screw head <b>32</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the rate of increase in diameter is also greater near the bone screw head <b>32</b>. Such a shape avoids stress risers and provides increased strength at the screw-plate junction, where it is needed the most. The tapering of screw shaft <b>33</b> may have a concave form, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref>, or may be linear. The distal portion of the screw shaft <b>33</b> may assume a constant diameter.</p>
    <p num="p-0178">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A and 24B</figref>, the thread <b>31</b> of the bone screw <b>30</b> has a substantially constant outer, or crest, diameter “d” from the proximal portion of the shaft below the bone screw head <b>32</b> to the distal portion of the shaft near the bone screw tip <b>36</b>. In the screw tip <b>36</b>, the crest diameter of thread <b>31</b> may be reduced for preferably one to two turns to facilitate the insertion and penetration of the bone screw <b>30</b> into the bone.</p>
    <p num="p-0179">In the preferred embodiment, the thread <b>31</b> of each bone screw <b>30</b> has an outer diameter slightly smaller than the diameter of the lowest portion <b>35</b> of the bone screw head <b>32</b>, which is adjacent the trailing, or upper, end of the associated thread <b>31</b>. In addition, the thread <b>31</b> is relatively thin, in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the screw, and tapers outwardly, and has a cross section of a triangle.</p>
    <p num="p-0180">An example of the dimensions of a bone screw for use in human anterior cervical spinal surgery for insertion into the vertebrae is as follows: the threaded portion of said screw has a length from about 10 mm to about 22 mm (12–18 mm preferred) and a head length from about 1 mm to about 3 mm (2–2.5 mm preferred). The threaded portion should have a maximum outside diameter from about 3.6 mm to about 5.2 mm (3.8–4.5 mm preferred) and the head has a diameter from about 3.8 mm to about 6 mm (4–5.5 mm preferred). The thread pitch is from about 1.25 mm to about 2.5 mm (1.5–2.0 mm preferred) and has a sharp and thin threaded profile. The apex of the two faces of the thread have an angle of less than about 21 degrees (15 degrees preferred) and the base of the thread is less than about 0.60 mm thick (0.25 mm–0.35 mm preferred). The screw has a root diameter that increases from proximately above the tip of the shank, along the longitudinal axis to proximately below the head portion of the screw. Preferably, the tip of the screw tip is fluted by at least one cut out section so as to make the screw self-tapping.</p>
    <p num="p-0181">Even though the thread <b>31</b> of the bone screw <b>30</b> has a thin profile, the thread will nevertheless be stronger than the bone into which it is introduced so that this thread will efficiently cut a thin helical groove in the bone tissue. The volume of bone that will be displaced by the thickness of the thread is minimized by the thin form of the thread, yet the substantial crest diameter of the screw thread maximizes the surface area of the threads in contact with the bone. While enlarging the screw shaft <b>33</b> diameter near the bone screw head <b>32</b> increases its strength where needed, reducing the screw shaft <b>33</b> diameter away from the bone screw head <b>32</b> where such strength is not required allows for the maximum area of engagement for the thread <b>31</b> to the bone.</p>
    <p num="p-0182">In the preferred embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A and 26</figref>, bone screw tip <b>36</b> is provided with cutting flutes <b>38</b>, to make the bone screw <b>30</b> self-tapping. Unlike the prior art bone screws, used for anterior cervical spinal surgery which are not self-tapping, the thread form of the present invention screw is itself more like a tap than a conventional screw in that the threads are very sharp and fluted. Additional embodiments of the bone screws <b>30</b> is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 53–55</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0183">By way of example, plates for fusing three adjacent vertebrae (2 interspaces, or two spinal segments) are shown. Each set of the bone screw receiving holes associated with a vertebrae is considered to be a segment of the plate so that for example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> three segments are shown—an upper, a central, and a lower segment. While the present discussion is in association with plates for use in fusing three vertebrae across two interspaces, it should be understood that longer and shorter plates having the appropriate number and location of bone screw receiving holes corresponding to the number of vertebrae to be fused are contemplated, and would take the form of the plates shown with fewer or more intermediate segments, such as the segment along line <b>9</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, or the intermediate segments of the plates shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 82–84F</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0184">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31–42</figref>, an outline of the steps of the method for installing the plates of the present invention is set forth below. A detailed description of the instrumentation and method for installing the plates of the present invention follows the outline.</p>
    <p num="h-0008">Step 1</p>
    <p num="p-0185">Having completed the interbody fusions, the surgeon removes any bone spurs or localized irregularities along the front of the spine of the area to be fused.</p>
    <p num="h-0009">Step 2</p>
    <p num="p-0186">The correct length plate is selected by the surgeon by measuring the distance on the spine by a caliper, ruler, template, and the like. That plate having a length sufficient to span the distance of the spine to be fused and to partially overlap a portion of each of the end vertebrae to be fused.</p>
    <p num="h-0010">Step 3</p>
    <p num="p-0187">Utilizing a plate holder, the plate is placed into the wound and positioned to confirm positioning, length, and screw hole alignment relative to the segments of the spine to be fused.</p>
    <p num="h-0011">Step 4</p>
    <p num="p-0188">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, with the plate thus positioned and securely held, the plate may be attached to any of the vertebrae to be fused (by example only, here shown as the top vertebra).</p>
    <p num="h-0012">Sub-Step 4A</p>
    <p num="p-0189">The pilot (guide) hole punch <b>60</b> is attached to the plate <b>2</b> as per <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, or alternatively, while not preferred the drill guide may be used as per <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>. In either event, the pilot hole forming means rigidly aligns with and is captured by the plate bone screw receiving hole wall.</p>
    <p num="h-0013">Sub-Step 4B</p>
    <p num="p-0190">The pilot hole is then formed by impacting the pilot hole punch of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> or drilling with the drill of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>. In the alternative while not preferred, the formation of the pilot hole can be done away with altogether and the correct screw selected so as to have a length less than the distance along its path to the posterior vertebral cortex can be directly inserted.</p>
    <p num="p-0191">The determination of the appropriate screw length is made by measuring or templating from radiographs, MRI's, or CT scans, or determined directly by measuring the depth of the disc space.</p>
    <p num="h-0014">Step 5</p>
    <p num="p-0192">The correct screw is then attached to the screw driver which regardless of the specific form of the screw driver engagement means, is designed to have an interference fit so as to remain firmly bound to the driver during transport to the insertion site. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41</figref>, <b>42</b>, <b>63</b>, <b>64</b>, <b>80</b> and <b>81</b> show various ways of achieving such a fit of the driver and screw. In addition to a wedging at the screw and driver interface, clips, and springs and other means are well known for temporarily and reversibly securing the screw to the driver, such as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 80</figref> where a slotted inwardly springing sleeve holds a threaded cap peripherally until, as it is screwed into the plate, it is automatically pushed back releasing the threaded cap.</p>
    <p num="p-0193">Once a first bone screw has been fully inserted into a vertebra through the plate, it is preferable to insert the other of the transverse pair in the manner already described as per <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0194">In a similar manner, it is possible to insert the remaining bone screws as per the surgeon's preference into each of the vertebrae to be included into the fusion, just the end vertebrae of the fusion construct, or additionally place screws into the fusion grafts.</p>
    <p num="p-0195">However, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33</figref>, <b>34</b>, <b>38</b> and <b>39</b>, it is possible with the present invention at the surgeon's option to place any portion or all of the fusion construct under compression and to do so intersegmentally or across the entire length of the fusion construct even when multi-segmented.</p>
    <p num="p-0196">It is appreciated that the same procedure could be generally used for any of the plate systems of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0197">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, the vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>a–c </i>are separated from one another by fusion graft blocks <b>51</b> which were previously installed in the spinal disc space between adjacent vertebrae <b>50</b> forming a fusion bone graft construct. Plate <b>2</b> is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> with the locking elements <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> removed in order to simplify the illustration. It will be understood, however, that in the preferred embodiment the locking elements <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> can be, and preferably are, pre-installed in the positions shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> prior to positioning plate <b>2</b> upon vertebral bodies of the vertebrae <b>50</b>, thereby saving the surgeon time and trouble.</p>
    <p num="p-0198">Plate <b>2</b> may be held in position by any known plate holding means, but preferably by the holding tools shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45</figref>, <b>46</b> or <b>70</b> by the notches <b>142</b> in the sides of the compression arms <b>104</b>, <b>130</b> of a vertebral compressor tool <b>100</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, or as a further alternative, by the unitary plate holder similar to the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 70</figref> design.</p>
    <p num="p-0199">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>, plate holder <b>870</b> has a hollow tubular housing <b>872</b>, with a central rod <b>874</b> having a thread <b>878</b> at one end for engaging one of the threaded locking holes <b>12</b> in the plate <b>2</b>. The bottom end of the housing <b>872</b> has projections <b>880</b>, <b>882</b> that extend outwardly and then downwardly to fit into the bone screw receiving holes <b>8</b> of the plate <b>2</b> preventing the housing <b>872</b> from rotating. The central rod <b>874</b> is located in the housing <b>872</b> such that it can be rotated by rotating a handle (not shown) which is fixed to the central rod <b>874</b> at its upper end.</p>
    <p num="p-0200">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref> an alternative embodiment of the plate holder <b>890</b> is shown. A single solid member <b>890</b> has a threaded projection <b>894</b> at its bottom end for attachment to the central threaded locking hole <b>12</b> in the plate. The bottom surface of the holder <b>890</b> of this embodiment is contoured so as to match the contours of the top surface of the plate adjacent to the locking hole <b>12</b>, shown as a depression <b>14</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
    <p num="p-0201">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 67–68</figref>, an embodiment of a plate holder for holding any of the plates while being positioned on the vertebrae is shown and generally referred to by the number <b>800</b>. The plate holder <b>800</b> has a hollow tubular housing <b>802</b>, with a central rod <b>804</b> having a handle <b>806</b> at one end and a thread <b>808</b> at its other end for engaging one of the threaded locking holes <b>12</b> in the plate <b>600</b>. The bottom end of the housing <b>802</b> has projections <b>810</b>, <b>812</b> that extend outwardly and then downwardly <b>814</b>, <b>816</b> to fit along the side edge of the plate <b>2</b> between the end and intermediate lobes <b>4</b>, preventing the housing <b>802</b> from rotating. The central rod <b>804</b> is located in the housing <b>802</b> such that it can be rotated by rotating the handle <b>806</b> which is fixed to the central rod <b>804</b> at its upper end. This central rod <b>804</b> can also be attached to the housing <b>802</b> so that it can move up and down to some extent, by any number of conventional ways, such as by having the central rod <b>804</b> have an annular depression with a length of approximately 3–5 mm, and a set screw projecting inward from the housing to engage the central rod <b>804</b>. Once the plate <b>600</b> is in the proper place and the plate is attached to one of the vertebrae by bone screws <b>30</b>, the central rod <b>804</b> is disconnected from the opening in the plate <b>600</b> and the holder <b>800</b> is removed.</p>
    <p num="p-0202"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 69A</figref> is an alternative embodiment of the plate holder <b>850</b>. A single solid member <b>852</b> has a threaded projection <b>854</b> at its bottom end for attachment to the central threaded locking hole <b>12</b> in the plate. The solid member <b>852</b> could also be threaded into a bone screw receiving hole <b>6</b>. The bottom surface of the holder <b>850</b> of this embodiment is contoured so as to match the contours of the top surface of the plate adjacent to the locking hole <b>12</b>, shown as a depression <b>14</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
    <p num="p-0203"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 69B</figref> is another embodiment of the plate holder <b>850</b>′. A housing <b>851</b>′ having an end <b>853</b>′ configured to engage a bone screw receiving hole <b>6</b> contains a rod <b>855</b>′ having an uneven diameter and having a threaded portion <b>857</b>′. As rod <b>855</b>′ is rotated by a handle similar to handle <b>806</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</figref>, rod <b>855</b>′ screws downward into the housing <b>851</b>′ into matching threads <b>858</b>′. As the end of rod <b>855</b>′ is driven down, it spreads portions <b>859</b> <i>a</i>′ and <b>859</b> <i>b</i>′ (<b>859</b> <i>c</i>′ and <b>859</b> <i>d</i>′ not shown) wedging plate holder <b>850</b>′ into a bone screw receiving hole of the plate. Plate holder <b>850</b>′ is best used with non-threaded bone screw receiving holes, but works for all types of bone screw receiving holes.</p>
    <p num="p-0204">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 70</figref>, an alternative embodiment of the plate holder referred to by the number <b>800</b>′ is shown in which there is a removable handle <b>860</b> that is used for first attaching the plate holder <b>800</b>′ to the plate, by rotating the shaft <b>804</b>, and then for holding the plate holder <b>800</b>′ off to the side by extension <b>864</b>, during the attachment procedure reducing the interference of the plate holder <b>800</b>′ with the surgical procedure.</p>
    <p num="p-0205">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, a compression tool <b>100</b> is shown with a toothed gear bar <b>102</b> having a first compression arm <b>104</b> secured to its free end. Compression arm <b>104</b> has at its distal end a bore <b>106</b> for removably holding either a plate engaging element <b>108</b>, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, having a hook <b>110</b> atone end for engaging a depression or notch <b>18</b> in the end of plate <b>2</b>, or for removably holding a compression post <b>54</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33–34</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, plate engaging element <b>108</b> includes a shaft <b>112</b> that will be inserted into the corresponding bore <b>106</b> of compression arm <b>104</b>, and a flange <b>115</b> for resting against the bottom face of bore <b>106</b> to accurately limit the depth of insertion of plate engaging element <b>108</b> into the bore <b>106</b>. A ring spring <b>128</b>, preferably of metal, is located in an annular depression of the shaft <b>112</b>, for holding the plate engaging element <b>108</b> in the bore <b>106</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0206">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38–39</figref>, compression tool <b>100</b> includes a second moveable compression arm <b>130</b> movable along toothed bar <b>102</b> parallel to first compression arm <b>104</b>. The distal end of the second compression arm <b>130</b> also has a bore <b>132</b>, the same as bore <b>106</b>, that can receive a removable compression post <b>54</b>. Bores <b>106</b> and <b>132</b> are the same so that either compression arm <b>104</b>, <b>130</b> can be used to hold the removable compression post <b>54</b>, permitting the compression tool <b>100</b> to be used in any orientation. By permitting the plate engaging element <b>108</b> and the compression post <b>54</b> to both rotate and slide in the bores <b>106</b>, <b>132</b> of the two compression arms <b>104</b>, <b>130</b>, with the plate engaging hook <b>110</b> able to work even at an angle to the plate allows for the apparatus to be readily attachable to the spine through the compression post <b>54</b> and plate.</p>
    <p num="p-0207">Compression arm <b>130</b> has a driving assembly consisting of a toothed wheel (not visible) which is engaged with the tooth gear <b>138</b> of bar toothed gear <b>102</b> and is connected to compression arm <b>130</b> such that compression arm <b>130</b> is movable along the length of toothed gear bar <b>102</b> by means of the rotation of handle <b>140</b>, which is connected to the toothed wheel. When the handle <b>140</b> is turned in the direction of the arrow shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, compression arm <b>130</b> is moved toward compression arm <b>104</b>. The driving assembly has a self lock release mechanism whereby the movement of the two compression arms <b>104</b>, <b>130</b> away from one another is prevented, without the activation of the release. On the inward distal end of each compression arm, on facing sides, is a notch <b>142</b> or recess for holding the plate <b>2</b> along its sides between the central lobes <b>4</b> and end lobes <b>4</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0208">While the toothed gear bar <b>102</b> and compression arms <b>104</b>, <b>130</b> have been described as being straight, it is possible that the toothed gear bar <b>102</b> and compression arms <b>104</b>, <b>130</b> may be arcuately or otherwise shaped, so as to induce lordosis in the vertebrae, if so desired.</p>
    <p num="p-0209">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, in the event that the compression tool <b>100</b> is used to hold the plate <b>2</b>, the ends <b>144</b> of the compression arms <b>104</b>, <b>130</b> will be located in line with the fusion graft construct <b>51</b> which was placed in the disc space when plate <b>2</b> is properly positioned. A gap will exist between plate <b>2</b> and each fusion graft construct <b>51</b>, providing a space to accommodate the free ends of arms <b>104</b>, <b>130</b> should they extend beyond the bottom surface of the plate <b>2</b>. As will be described below, the same compression tool <b>100</b> can also be used for compressing a plurality of cervical vertebral bodies with bone grafts interposed during the attachment of plate <b>2</b> to the vertebrae <b>50</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0210">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, plate <b>2</b> is held by a suitable holder, in this case shown as the compression arms <b>104</b> and <b>130</b>. Once the appropriate length plate <b>2</b> has been properly positioned so that the bone screw receiving holes <b>6</b> are aligned with each of the respective vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>a–c </i>to be fused, the next step is the formation of bone screw receiving holes <b>6</b> prior to installation of the bone screws <b>30</b> themselves in the vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>a</i>. While the procedure is described as first attaching the plate <b>2</b> to the upper vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>a</i>, the plate <b>2</b> can be attached to any of the vertebrae in any order. Different sized plates are used so that, as indicated above, the physician will select the appropriate sized plate in which the bone screw receiving holes <b>6</b>, <b>8</b> are aligned with the three adjacent vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>a</i>, <b>50</b> <i>b </i>and <b>50</b> <i>c</i>. Pilot holes are formed by a pilot hole forming apparatus <b>60</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 32</figref>. Unlike with known prior art and screw plating systems, the bone screws <b>30</b> may be inserted without the prior formation of an opening into the vertebrae as the bone screws <b>30</b> are preferably sharp pointed, self-tapping, and have at their tip a diminishing major diameter to assist the screw entering and pulling into the bone. However, while a hole into the bone of the vertebrae may be formed prior to screw insertion, it is preferable that the hole be of a smaller diameter than the root diameter of the screw and for a different purpose than with the prior art. With the prior art the hole drilled had to be of a diameter equal to but preferably larger than the root (minor) diameter of the screw, as the screws were not self-tapping. It is desirous to create pilot holes to assure that a proper path for the bone screws <b>30</b> is maintained, and also to prevent damage to the vertebral bone during insertion of the bone screws <b>30</b>. In addition, the pilot hole forming apparatus <b>60</b> creates a more compact vertebral bone mass for reception of the self-tapping bone screw <b>30</b> used in this insertion.</p>
    <p num="p-0211">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 32</figref>, pilot hole forming apparatus <b>60</b> includes a hollow cylindrical housing <b>62</b> having a bottom provided with a through hole <b>63</b>. Housing <b>62</b> contains a central shaft <b>64</b> which extends through the through hole <b>63</b> in the bottom of housing <b>62</b>. The leading end <b>66</b> of shaft <b>64</b> tapers gradually to a sharp point <b>65</b>. Shaft <b>64</b> is provided with a ring member <b>78</b> having a diameter which closely corresponds to the inner diameter of housing <b>62</b> to guide the travel of shaft <b>64</b> within housing <b>62</b>. A compression spring <b>67</b> is interposed between the ring member <b>78</b> and the bottom of housing <b>62</b>. Compression spring <b>67</b> provides a bias force which normally urges the sharp point <b>65</b> into a retracted position within housing <b>62</b>. The upper end of shaft <b>64</b> has an enlarged head <b>68</b> extending outside of the housing <b>62</b> which is intended to be manually depressed or struck by a percussion instrument in order to drive the sharp point <b>65</b> out of housing <b>62</b> and into a vertebral body <b>50</b> <i>a</i>. Shaft <b>64</b> is given a length, taking into account the length that spring <b>67</b> will have when fully compressed, to determine the maximum depth of the pilot hole formed in a vertebral body. The depth is selected to assure that the pilot hole does not reach the posterior cortex of the vertebral body, which borders the spinal canal.</p>
    <p num="p-0212">Certain structural features of hole forming apparatus <b>60</b> are shown in greater detail in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>. In particular, it can be seen that the bottom end of housing <b>62</b> has a projecting portion <b>69</b> dimensioned to fit precisely in a bone screw receiving hole <b>6</b> or <b>8</b> of plate <b>2</b>. The bottom <b>71</b> of the projecting portion <b>69</b> is flat in a plane perpendicular to the axis of housing <b>62</b>. When the projecting portion <b>69</b> of housing <b>62</b> is snugly inserted into a bone screw receiving hole <b>6</b>, <b>8</b> and the flat bottom <b>71</b> is placed flush against the upper surface of plate <b>2</b>, it is assured that the leading end <b>66</b> of shaft <b>64</b> will form a pilot hole in the vertebral bone having an axis perpendicular to the plane of the associated portion of plate <b>2</b>, thereby assuring that the bone screw <b>30</b> will be subsequently installed so that its axis is also perpendicular to the plane which is parallel to the upper and lower surfaces of the associated portion of plate <b>2</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0213">When a plate is used which has a threaded bone screw receiving hole, the lower end of the pilot hole forming apparatus <b>60</b> is threaded so as to engage the thread in the bone screw receiving hole <b>6</b>, <b>8</b> thereby fixing the plate and the pilot hole forming apparatus together, assuring a stable fit between the pilot hole forming apparatus and the plate <b>2</b>. It should be noted that the diameter of the leading end <b>66</b> of the shaft <b>64</b> is small since it has to fit within the small space left between the inside wall of the pilot hole forming apparatus. Since it is only a pilot hole for a self-tapping bone screw <b>30</b> that is being formed, the small diameter is satisfactory.</p>
    <p num="p-0214">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, if for any reason it should be desired to form the pilot hole in the vertebral body <b>50</b> by drilling, rather than by the use of the pilot hole forming apparatus <b>60</b>, use can be made of a drill guide <b>80</b>, having a lower end as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>. The drill <b>80</b> guide consists of a tubular member <b>82</b> and a small diameter lower end <b>84</b> which is dimensioned to achieve a precise interference fit in the associated bone screw receiving hole <b>6</b>, <b>8</b> of plate <b>2</b>. Along the small diameter lower end <b>84</b>, drill guide <b>80</b> has an axial end surface in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the drill guide <b>80</b> so that when the small diameter portion <b>84</b> is fitted into the bone screw receiving hole <b>6</b> and the surface surrounding the small diameter portion <b>84</b> is flush against the upper surface of plate <b>2</b>, the axis of the drill guiding bore <b>86</b> in drill guide <b>80</b> will be precisely perpendicular to the upper and lower surfaces of the associated portion of plate <b>2</b>. As with the case described above, the bottom end of the drill guide <b>80</b> can be threaded so as to engage to the threaded opening of plate <b>2</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0215">After the bone screw receiving holes <b>6</b>, <b>8</b> are formed in the vertebral body <b>50</b> <i>a </i>through the upper two bone screw securing holes <b>6</b> of plate <b>2</b> by means of either hole forming apparatus <b>60</b> or drill guide <b>80</b>, bone screws <b>30</b> are threaded into the vertebrae <b>50</b> while holding the plate <b>2</b> firmly against the vertebrae <b>50</b> with compression tool <b>100</b> or plate holder <b>800</b>. This locks the plate to the vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0216">It is then possible, if desired, to compress the fusion graft in the next adjacent vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>b </i>before attaching bone screws <b>30</b> to the adjacent vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>b </i>through the central bone screw receiving holes of plate <b>2</b>. Once the initial bone screws are in place in the vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>a</i>, the plate holder <b>100</b> or <b>800</b> may be removed from the plate <b>2</b>. The compression of the fusion graft construct between the two adjacent vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>a </i>and <b>50</b> <i>b </i>is achieved as follows:</p>
    <p num="p-0217">Compression post <b>54</b> is driven through the central locking hole <b>12</b> of plate <b>2</b> by means of insertion tool <b>90</b>, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33</figref>, <b>34</b> and <b>35</b>, into the vertebral bone of vertebra <b>50</b> <i>b</i>, where it will be used in a subsequent step to apply a compression force between vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>a </i>and <b>50</b> <i>b</i>. Compression post <b>54</b> consists of a shaft <b>56</b> having a sharp point <b>57</b> at its lower end, an enlarged central collar <b>58</b> which serves as a depth stop, and a circumferential groove <b>59</b> proximate its upper end, defining an enlarged head <b>55</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0218">Compression post insertion tool <b>90</b> consists of a shaft <b>92</b> having a closed hollow portion <b>94</b> at its lower end <b>96</b> for receiving compression post <b>54</b> and an enlarged percussion cap <b>98</b> at its other end. Compression post insertion tool <b>90</b> also includes in its lower end <b>96</b> a second opening <b>95</b> having a recess <b>99</b> in its inside wall for permitting engagement of the enlarged head <b>55</b> on the compression post <b>54</b> within the depression <b>97</b>. The second opening <b>95</b> is in communication with the hollow portion <b>94</b> of the insertion tool <b>90</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0219">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, the bore <b>132</b> in the second compression arm <b>130</b> of compression tool <b>100</b> is then applied over compression post <b>54</b> in vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>b</i>, and the plate engaging element <b>108</b> is inserted in the bore <b>106</b> of the first compression arm <b>104</b> of compression tool <b>100</b>. The hook <b>110</b> of the plate engaging element <b>108</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> is fitted into the notch <b>18</b> at the end of the plate <b>2</b> which is fixed by the bone screws <b>30</b> inserted into the vertebra <b>50</b> <i>a</i>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>. As indicated above, however, the compression tool <b>100</b> can be rotated so that the first compression arm <b>104</b> is now at the bottom and is able to fit over the compression post <b>54</b> in vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>c. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0220">Since the plate is attached to vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>a </i>by means of bone screws <b>30</b> and compression post <b>54</b> is fixed to the adjacent vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>b</i>, movement of the first and second compression arms <b>104</b> and <b>130</b> in the direction of vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>a </i>by rotation of handle <b>140</b> results in compression of the bone graft construct <b>51</b> between the adjacent vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>a </i>and <b>50</b> <i>b</i>. The distance of several millimeters is sufficient for compression of the bone graft construct <b>51</b>. Once the desired compression is obtained, bone screw pilot holes can be formed in vertebral body <b>50</b> <i>b </i>by means of pilot hole forming apparatus <b>60</b>, as described above, for insertion of bone screws <b>30</b> into bone screw receiving holes <b>8</b> of bone plate <b>2</b>, fixing the plate <b>2</b> to the adjacent vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>b</i>. Compression tool <b>100</b> can then be withdrawn by activation of the release.</p>
    <p num="p-0221"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> illustrates the use of compression tool <b>100</b> to induce compression between the lower two vertebral bodies <b>50</b> <i>b </i>and <b>50</b> <i>c </i>after bone screws <b>30</b> have been installed in the middle vertebral body <b>50</b> <i>b </i>as just described. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, compression post <b>54</b> remains in place in the middle vertebral body <b>50</b> <i>b </i>and an additional compression post <b>54</b> is driven into the lower vertebral body <b>50</b> <i>c </i>by means of pilot hole forming tool <b>60</b> distal to the plate itself in the recess between the end projections <b>4</b> to allow for the lower compression post <b>64</b> to be moved towards vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>b </i>upwardly as shown. The original compression post <b>64</b> is inserted in bore <b>106</b> in the first compression arm <b>104</b> and the additional compression post <b>54</b> is inserted into the bore <b>132</b> of the second compression arm <b>130</b> of compression tool <b>100</b>. Again, as discussed above, the turning of the handle <b>140</b> results in the two compression arms <b>104</b>, <b>130</b> moving towards one another, resulting in the compression post <b>54</b> in vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>c </i>moving towards the upper compression post <b>54</b> in vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>b</i>, once again compressing the fusion graft construct <b>51</b> between vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>b </i>and <b>50</b> <i>c</i>. The upper compression post <b>54</b> in vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>b </i>can not move since the vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>b </i>has been fixed to the plate by the insertion of the bone screws <b>30</b> in the bone screw receiving holes <b>8</b> of the plate <b>2</b>. Thus, only the lower compression post <b>54</b> and vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>c </i>can move. As before, the pilot holes associated with vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>c </i>are formed and the bone screws <b>30</b> are inserted through bone screw receiving holes <b>6</b>. The compression tool <b>100</b> is then removed. Compression post <b>54</b> is then extracted from the vertebrae by inserting it in the second opening <b>95</b> of the compression post insertion/removal tool <b>90</b>, so that it engages the enlarged head <b>55</b> of the end of compression post <b>54</b> by depression <b>97</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0222">It is recognized that other variations in the order of compression may be employed. For example, during the compression of the fusion graft construct <b>51</b> between vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>b </i>and <b>50</b> <i>c</i>, the hook <b>110</b> of plate engagement element <b>108</b> may engage the notch <b>18</b> in the end of the plate <b>2</b>, and the other compression arm of the compression tool <b>100</b> may engage the compression post <b>54</b> in the third adjacent vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>c</i>. It should also be noted that plate <b>2</b> has a recess end cut out portion between the lobes at the end of the plate for insertion of the compression post <b>54</b> in the vertebrae. Otherwise, there may not be room below the end of the plate <b>2</b> for insertion of the compression post <b>54</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0223">It will be noted that the above-described procedure will be performed with the bone screws <b>30</b> fully inserted into vertebral bodies <b>50</b> <i>a</i>, <b>50</b> <i>b </i>and <b>50</b> <i>c </i>and lordosis is maintained during compression of the bone graft construct <b>51</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0224">As indicated above, the procedure for attaching the plate <b>2</b> to the vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>a</i>, <b>50</b> <i>b </i>and <b>50</b> <i>c </i>was illustrated without the locking screws <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> in place on the plate <b>2</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> is a perspective view showing the plate <b>2</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–5</figref>, at a stage of a surgical procedure when bone screws <b>30</b> have been fully installed in three adjacent vertebrae <b>50</b> <i>a</i>, <b>50</b> <i>b </i>and <b>50</b> <i>c</i>, and locking screws <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> have been rotated through an angle of about 90N to lock three bone screws <b>30</b> in place; the left-hand locking screw <b>20</b> as viewed has been rotated through an angle of about 60N to lock three bone screws <b>30</b> in place and the central locking screw <b>21</b> has been rotated through an angle of about 90N to lock two other bone screws <b>30</b> in place. At this time, one of the camming surfaces <b>44</b> of each locking screw <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> rests atop the screw head <b>32</b> of a respective bone screw <b>30</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0225">Installation of the locking cap <b>300</b> can also be performed with a tool <b>220</b> such as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41 and 42</figref> having a suitably shaped tip <b>222</b> with a length corresponding to the depth of hole <b>306</b> in a locking cap <b>300</b>. The end <b>222</b> of tool <b>220</b> is flared just proximal to the most distal end so that it creates a friction fit with the screw cap <b>300</b> for ease of manipulation, and prevents the screw cap <b>300</b> from falling off the tool <b>200</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0226"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref> is a cross-sectional view in the plane of the center of the two end locking screw holes <b>6</b> of plate <b>2</b>, with two bone screws <b>30</b> in their installed positions and locking element <b>21</b> in its locking position. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref> is an enlarged view of one of the bone screws <b>30</b> in plate <b>2</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>. In a preferred embodiment, the axis of each screw <b>30</b> is generally perpendicular to tangents to the upper and lower surfaces of plate <b>2</b> at points which are intersected by the longitudinal axis of the associated bone screw <b>30</b>. Thus, because of the curvature of plate <b>2</b> in the plane of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>, bone screws <b>30</b> can be directed so as to converge toward one another at a desired angle. Preferably, such angle will be greater than 14°. More preferably, such angle will be greater than 14° and less than 30°. The axis of the two bone screws <b>30</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref> may subtend an angle of about 45N. Alternatively, the curvature of the plate from side to side may be so as to conform to the surface of the anterior aspect of the human adult cervical spine and the axis of the paired screw hole may deviate from being perpendicular to the plate when viewed on end to achieve optimal convergence.</p>
    <p num="p-0227">Because the bone screws <b>30</b>, once inserted, are locked to the plate, a “claw” of a rigid triangular frame structure is obtained at each pair of bone screws <b>30</b> such that the attachment of plate <b>2</b> to the vertebral bodies <b>50</b> <i>a</i>, <b>50</b> <i>b </i>and <b>50</b> <i>c </i>would be highly secure due to the trapping of a wedged mass of bone material between the angled bone screws triangle, even if any thread stripping should occur. The “claw” may be further formed by three angled bone screws in a tripod configuration or by four bone screws in a four sided claw configuration.</p>
    <p num="p-0228">A plating system according to each of the above embodiments can be installed in the same manner as described above, and using the same instruments and tools, as illustrated and described above with respect to the first embodiment. In the case of the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the compression operations would be performed by means of slot <b>232</b> instead of the middle locking screw hole <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p num="h-0015">2. The Single Locking Plate Systems</p>
    <p num="p-0229">The single locking plate system will now be described. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 47–52</figref> are views of a first embodiment of a single locking plate system. The contour of plate <b>600</b> is the same as the plate <b>2</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–5</figref>. Plate <b>600</b> contains bone screw receiving holes <b>602</b> which are internally threaded <b>603</b> for receiving corresponding locking elements in the form of a locking cap <b>610</b>, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 56–59</figref>. For example, in plate <b>600</b>, the bone screw hole <b>602</b> has an outer diameter of approximately 5 mm with a preferred range of 4–6 mm; and a threaded inner diameter of approximately 4.8 mm, with a range of 3.5–5.8 mm for this use. Attaching means other than threads may be used, such as bayonet type attachment elements.</p>
    <p num="p-0230">The bottom of each bone screw receiving hole <b>602</b> has an inwardly stepped portion of properly selected dimensions for retaining an associated bone screw <b>170</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 53–55</figref>. As described in greater detail below, in this embodiment, a single locking element in the form of a locking cap <b>610</b> having threads <b>608</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 56-59</figref>, is associated with each of the bone screws receiving holes <b>602</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0231">The difference between the bone screw <b>170</b> used in the single locking embodiment of the plate from the bone screw used in association with the multiple locking plate is essentially due to the fact that whereas in the multiple locking plate embodiment the locking elements slide over a portion of the top <b>39</b> of the screw head <b>32</b>, in the single locking embodiment the locking cap <b>610</b> fits over the head <b>172</b> of the bone screw <b>170</b>. Therefore, the head <b>172</b> of the bone screw <b>170</b> of the present embodiment need not be smooth. This permits the head <b>172</b> of this embodiment bone screw <b>170</b> to be thicker and stronger.</p>
    <p num="p-0232"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</figref> shows two bone screws <b>170</b> and associated threaded locking caps <b>610</b> in their fully installed positions. In these positions, head portions <b>174</b> and <b>176</b> of each bone screw <b>170</b> form an interference fit with corresponding portions of an associated bone screw receiving hole <b>602</b>. Rim <b>612</b> of each threaded locking cap <b>610</b> forms an interference fit with upper portion <b>178</b> of the head of its associated bone screw <b>170</b>. Because the thread <b>608</b> of each locking cap <b>610</b> mates precisely with the internal thread in an associated bone screw receiving hole <b>602</b>, each threaded locking cap <b>610</b> is additionally subjected to a clamping force between associated head portion <b>178</b> and the internal threads <b>603</b> of associated bone screw receiving hole <b>602</b>. The rounded head <b>614</b> of each threaded locking cap <b>610</b> assures that the upper surface of an assembled plating system will be free of sharp edges, or projections.</p>
    <p num="p-0233">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 80 and 81</figref> tools for use in inserting both the bone screws and the locking cap in the single locking plate <b>600</b> are shown. In the first embodiment of the driving tool <b>1000</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 80</figref>, the tool <b>1000</b> has an outer tubular housing <b>1002</b>. Within the housing <b>1002</b> is a torks type or hexagonal driver <b>1004</b> that has a projecting end <b>1006</b> that corresponds to the recess <b>306</b> in the cap <b>610</b> for engagement with the cap <b>610</b>. As indicated above, the driver <b>1004</b> is configured so that it makes a firm attachment for the locking cap <b>610</b> for holding the locking cap <b>610</b> firmly to the driver. The hex driver <b>1004</b> is hollow so as to be able to permit the shaft <b>1010</b> of a Phillips or torks screw driver to fit through the hollow portion <b>1012</b> for engagement by its tip <b>1012</b> with the corresponding recess <b>180</b> of bone screw <b>170</b> for engagement by the end <b>1006</b> of the driver <b>1004</b>. The shaft <b>1010</b> of the driver <b>1000</b> is longer than the tubular housing and driver <b>1004</b> has an upper end (not shown) extending from the top end of the tubular housing <b>1002</b> so that it can be rotated by the handle.</p>
    <p num="p-0234">The housing <b>1002</b> has a diameter that permits the locking cap <b>610</b> to be held within the inner end of the tubular housing <b>1002</b> by a friction fit or to the driver <b>1004</b>. It is appreciated that other methods of holding the locking cap <b>610</b> within the end of the tubular housing <b>1000</b> may also be employed.</p>
    <p num="p-0235">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 80</figref>, the operation of the bone screw and locking element driver <b>1000</b> is as follows: the cap <b>610</b> is inserted onto the end of the cap driver <b>1004</b>, and then the cap driver <b>1004</b> with the shaft <b>1010</b> of the bone screw driver passing through the central longitudinal opening of the cap driver. As shown, the bone screw driver shaft <b>1010</b> passes through the recess <b>306</b> in the cap <b>610</b> and engages the recess <b>180</b> in the head of the bone screw <b>170</b>. The bone screw <b>170</b> is shown being installed in a bone screw receiving hole in the plate <b>600</b>. The handle (not shown) of the bone screw driver is rotated, thereby screwing the bone screw <b>170</b> in place. Since the diameter of the bone screw driver is less than the width of the recess <b>306</b> of the cap <b>610</b>, the bone screw driver shaft <b>1010</b> is able to rotate without rotation of the cap <b>610</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0236">The hollow tubular housing <b>1002</b> rests on the top surface of the plate <b>600</b> and assists in the alignment of the shaft <b>1010</b> in relationship to the plate. Once the bone screw <b>170</b> is inserted, the cap driver <b>1004</b> is depressed until the threads <b>608</b> on the outside of the cap <b>610</b> engages the threads <b>603</b> of the bone screw receiving hole. The cap driver <b>1004</b> is then turned until the cap <b>610</b> is securely locked in place.</p>
    <p num="p-0237">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 81</figref>, an alternative embodiment of the combination bone screw and locking cap driver is shown. In this embodiment, a housing is not used. Instead, the driver shaft <b>1010</b> holds the cap <b>610</b> by friction and the handle <b>620</b> for the bone screw driver shaft <b>1010</b> is rotated. A ball spring assembly <b>622</b> holds the cap driver <b>1002</b> up until the bone screw has been screwed into the bone screw receiving hole. Driver <b>1010</b> has an elongated portion that once the bone screw has been installed, the ball spring <b>622</b> is depressed and the handle <b>624</b> associated with the cap driver is permitted to descend for rotation of the cap <b>610</b>. A tubular housing can be employed to assist in aligning of the cap <b>610</b> in the bone screw receiving hole, as indicated above.</p>
    <p num="p-0238">The drivers shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 80 and 81</figref> simplify the procedure, and reduce the number of instruments that are necessary to be used during the installation procedure. The procedure is quick and reliable, giving the physician more assurance that small watch parts will not be lost or difficult to manipulate.</p>
    <p num="p-0239"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref> is a top view of the plate <b>600</b> partially installed, with threaded locking caps <b>600</b> installed in bone screw receiving holes <b>602</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0240"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 53–55</figref> show a bone screw <b>170</b> for use with the single locking plating system according to the invention. Bone screw <b>170</b> differs from bone screw <b>30</b> previously described in detail, only with regard to the stepped configuration of head <b>172</b>. Preferably, bone screw <b>170</b> includes a lower portion <b>174</b> which is contiguous with the screw shank and has a reduced diameter equal to the maximum diameter of the shank <b>176</b>. Portion <b>178</b> of head <b>172</b> also has smaller diameter than lower portion <b>174</b>. The thread <b>182</b> has the same configuration as for the bone screw <b>30</b> discussed above. However, either embodiment of bone screws can be used with any of the plates.</p>
    <p num="p-0241">As in the case of the multiple locking plating system described above, the bone screws <b>170</b> for use in the single locking plating system are preferably solid, where the screws adjoin the lower plate surface, where screws used with prior art plates are most prone to breakage, the only recess in the heads being for engagement of the tip <b>222</b> of driving tool <b>220</b> and with the recess being above the critical area. Therefore, these bone screws <b>170</b> remain robust. The screw heads are not deeply slitted into portions and the locking caps do not impose a radial outer force on the associated bone screw heads so the screw heads do not spread apart so as to be stressed and weakened.</p>
    <p num="p-0242">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 71</figref>, <b>73</b> and <b>75</b> another alternative embodiment of the single locking plate system of the present invention is shown and referred to by the number <b>500</b>. The plate <b>500</b> has the same contour as the plate <b>2</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–5</figref>, but associated with each of the bone screw openings <b>502</b>, are threaded openings <b>524</b> offset from the bone screw openings <b>502</b> for receiving the locking element <b>506</b>, <b>508</b>, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 72 and 74</figref> as a threaded locking set screw or cap <b>506</b> or screw <b>508</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0243">It is appreciated that other configurations of single locking plates may be employed. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82</figref>, a single locking plate <b>900</b> is shown in which there are a pair of bone screw receiving holes <b>910</b> at its ends <b>930</b> and a number of bone screw receiving holes <b>950</b> along the longitudinal axis of the plate <b>900</b>. The additional bone screw receiving holes <b>950</b> permit a single plate to be able to be aligned with a number of different sized vertebrae disc spaces, and bone fusion grafts. As indicated above, the plate of the present invention shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–5</figref>, requires that a properly sized plate be selected by the surgeon so that each pair of bone screw receiving holes <b>6</b>, <b>8</b> line up with the appropriate vertebrae. This requires a number of different sized plates to be available for optimum attachment of the bone screw receiving holes to each of the vertebrae. With the plate <b>900</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82</figref>, the close spacing and increased number of central openings permit the surgeon to locate at least one appropriate opening to be aligned with each of the intermediate vertebrae, and/or bone grafts.</p>
    <p num="p-0244">The procedure for installation of the single locking plates is substantially the same as described herein in detail for the multiple locking plates. The central longitudinal slot <b>670</b> in the single locking plates is used for the compression procedure. The same instrumentation is used to create the plate hole either by means of a punch or a drill. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 60–69</figref> show the various steps in the procedure for installation of the single locking plates, comparable to the steps employed in the installation of the multiple locking plates.</p>
    <p num="p-0245">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 76–79</figref> the heads <b>507</b> and <b>526</b> of the locking elements <b>508</b> and <b>522</b> have a recess <b>510</b> and <b>524</b> corresponding to the radius of the bone screw openings <b>502</b> and <b>528</b> so that the locking element <b>508</b> and <b>522</b> may be installed in place prior to the insertion of the bone screw <b>170</b> into the bone screw receiving hole <b>502</b> and <b>528</b>. When the locking elements <b>508</b> and <b>522</b> are rotated, a portion of its head extends over the top of the head of bone screw <b>170</b> to lock it in place. As with the above embodiments, the bottom surface of the locking screws <b>508</b> and <b>522</b> can have a camming or other configuration for engagement with the top surface <b>39</b> of the associated bone screw <b>170</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0246">While the plate instrumentation and method have been described in association with attaching a plate to the vertebrae of the spine, it should be appreciated that the plates can be adopted for specification to other parts of the body. See, for example, application Ser. No. 09/022,344, filed Feb. 11, 1998, and titled Skeletal Plating System, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,139,550, incorporated by reference above. However, the dimensions of the plate, the specific contours and placement of the bone screw receiving holes would have to be modified.</p>
    <p num="p-0247">Similarly, the bone screws described in this application could be used in other parts of the body, again being modified so as to serve their intended purposed, depending on the size of the body part in which they are to be installed.</p>
    <p num="p-0248">While particular embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that changes and modifications may be made without departing from this invention in its broader aspects and, therefore, the aim in the appended claims is to cover all such changes and modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of this invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0249">While specific innovative features may have been presented in reference to specific examples, they are just examples, and it should be understood that various combinations of these innovative features beyond those specifically shown are taught such that they may now be easily alternatively combined and are hereby anticipated and claimed.</p>
