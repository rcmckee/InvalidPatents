<heading>BACKGROUND</heading> <p num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
  <p num="p-0004">The invention relates in general to the field of waste disposal systems, and in particular to a system for sorting medical waste for disposal.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
  <p num="p-0006">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) enforces the Resource Conservation &amp; Recovery Act (RCRA) which was enacted in 1976 in order to control the disposal of harmful or hazardous waste materials. There are currently over 100,000 drugs commercially available in the United States, of which about 14,000 are considered hazardous by RCRA requirements. A typical medium size hospital utilizes thousands of different drugs in a year of which hundreds are considered hazardous. The EPA is increasingly enforcing hospitals' compliance with the RCRA requirements because it has been shown in several studies that the 72 million pounds of pharmaceutical waste generated each year by hospitals and individuals is contributing to the pollution of groundwater and endocrine system damage in humans and other species. In addition, many organizations including Hospital for a Healthy Environment (H2E) and Joint Council for Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) are pressing hospitals to be more environmentally friendly. In view of these changes, hospitals are increasing efforts to audit their own compliance with the laws. As a result, these hospitals are becoming more aware of the difficulty of sorting the numerous pharmaceutical waste streams that the EPA, Department of Transportation (DOT), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and some states require.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">More than 3.2 million tons of medical waste is generated by hospitals, medical clinics and pharmaceutical manufacturers each year. Half of this waste is considered infectious. Most of the infectious waste was treated in over 2400 incinerators throughout the country, until 1998 when the EPA began to enforce tough environmental emission laws that have reduced the number of incinerators to just over a hundred nationwide. Now much of the infectious waste is treated by alternative technologies such as autoclaves and chemical processors. There is very little choice for hospitals because of the upfront cost and large footprint of the processing equipment. Although many companies have offered different kinds of equipment, the prices vary from a few hundred thousand dollars for smaller units to a few million for large units. Because of the long cycling times to decontaminate the waste, the equipment typically is very large in order to provide acceptable throughput. There are also several companies that provide a service to hospitals by utilizing chemical processors mounted on trucks. They go to a facility and decontaminate the infectious waste, allowing the treated waste to be hauled to a local landfill. There are concerns that this technology may not completely treat the waste in all circumstances and the chemical residue left after processing may remain an ecological issue.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">Increasingly, hospitals are required to comply with the recent and projected enforcement of federal and state hazardous pharmaceutical waste regulations. Currently, clinicians must manually sort pharmaceutical waste streams into different colored containers for proper disposal of the separate waste streams. It is often not clear to a clinician which pharmaceuticals or waste materials are hazardous simply by looking at the container. Such confusion may lead to clinicians throwing hazardous drugs in non-hazardous containers such as sharps containers, infectious waste bags, non-hazardous pharmaceutical containers or simply down the drain.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0009">There remains a need for a system for allowing clinicians to more easily sort medical waste items for appropriate disposal. There also remains a need for an automated system of waste disposal that encourages and facilitates hospital compliance with the relevant federal and state regulations.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">Several embodiments of the present application describe systems and devices to sort and process infectious and pharmaceutical waste streams. Embodiments of a medical waste sorting system advantageously provide a labor savings for doctors, nurses and other clinicians by taking the bulk of the decision making associated with sorting medical waste away from the clinician. In one embodiment, a medical waste sorting system is provided, which will help clinicians conveniently comply with the recent and projected enforcement of federal and state hazardous waste laws. In some embodiments, the system can be configured to scan a bar code, RFID tag, or other system for identifying a spent drug. The spent drug can then be classified into an appropriate waste category, and a door can be automatically opened to provide access to a unique waste container for convenient disposal of the drug in compliance with applicable regulations.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">In addition to the need for medical and pharmaceutical waste sorting, there exists a need to improve areas of water quality analysis and workplace safety. These areas include sampling water quality throughout the hospital to pinpoint inappropriate dumping of hazardous materials down the drain and improved programs that reduce hospital worker exposure to hazardous materials in the workplace.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">In one embodiment, the invention comprises a system and method for sorting waste using one or more restricted access containers. In a preferred embodiment, the system and method comprises a plurality of containers associated with a plurality of waste categories, wherein at least one of the containers is configured to restrict access to the internal portion of the container when the container is open. The system and method may also include a waste item identification device configured to determine a qualitative parameter of an item of waste, and a database comprising waste item classification information. The system and method may also include a control system programmed to compare the qualitative parameter of the item to information contained in the database, and assign the item to a waste category. The system and method (e.g., the control system in one embodiment) can be further configured to identify at least one of the containers based on the waste category.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">In one embodiment, the container prevents unauthorized personnel from accessing the waste item once the item has been deposited into the container, thereby restricting access to the internal contents of that container.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">In one embodiment, at least one of the containers comprises a lid. In one embodiment, one of the containers comprises a lid. In another embodiment, all of the containers comprise lids. In yet another embodiment, some of the containers comprise lids. In a further embodiment, one lid is used to cover two or more containers. In one embodiment, the system comprises one or more lids, wherein the lid is formed integrally with the container.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">The lid may comprise a V-shaped cross-section and circular outer edges. A “V-shaped cross-section” as used herein shall be given its ordinary meaning and shall also include substantially V-shaped configurations. In one embodiment, the V-shaped lid comprises an angle of about 135 degrees. Shapes other than “V” may also be used. In some embodiments, the angle is greater than 0 degrees and less than 180 degrees. In one embodiment, the V-shaped lid (or similar shaped lid, such as a U-shape or L-shape, or T-shape) has an angle that is about 120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145, or 150 degrees.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">In one embodiment, at least one of the containers comprises a shield. In one embodiment, the shield acts in concert with the lid to physically restrict access to the inside of the container. In one embodiment, the shield cooperatively moves with the lid. In one embodiment, the shield is positioned at one end of the lid. The shield may be positioned at the end of the lid, at the center of the lid, or positioned somewhere in between.</p>
  <p num="p-0017">In one embodiment, the system comprises a latch assembly. In one embodiment, the latch assembly is coupled to the container and/or the lid. The latch assembly can cause the lid to open and/or close.</p>
  <p num="p-0018">In one embodiment, a system and method for sorting waste based on primary and alternate disposal strategies is disclosed. In a preferred embodiment, the system and method comprises a plurality of containers associated with a plurality of waste categories.

  <p num="p-0101">Embodiments of devices and methods for sorting a plurality of medical wastes will now be described with reference to the attached figures. In several embodiments, the waste sorting and disposal system is automated. In some embodiments, a medical waste sorting system comprising a plurality of individual sorting and disposal stations connected to one another via a centralized or de-centralized network is provided. Alternatively, a medical waste sorting system can comprise one or more stand-alone sorting and disposal stations configured to operate independently of any other device. Although some of the following embodiments are described in the context of individual stand-alone stations, it should be recognized that such individual stations can be connected in a networked system to provide additional functionality or to improve efficiency. Conversely, some embodiments are described below in the context of networked systems, certain features and advantages of which can be readily applied to individual stand-alone systems as will be clear to the skilled artisan. The term “sorting” is a broad term and shall be given its ordinary meaning and generally refers to the distribution of one or more waste items into one or more appropriate waste receptacles. The term “disposing” is also a broad term and shall be given its ordinary meaning and shall, in some embodiments, generally refer to the discarding or “throwing out” of one or more items of waste into an appropriate receptacle. As used herein, the terms receptacle and container are broad terms that can be used interchangeably.</p>
  <p num="p-0102">In one embodiment, a waste sorting and disposal station comprises a sorting station or machine, which includes a series of container positions or compartments, each compartment being configured to receive a removable container for collecting waste belonging to a particular category or classification. Some embodiments of a sorting station comprise a waste-identifying device, a processor configured to carry out a waste-sorting algorithm, and a waste-sorting mechanism. As used herein, the term “removable” shall be given its ordinary meaning, and shall include disposable or reusable containers.</p>
  <p num="p-0103">In some embodiments, a sorting machine comprises one or more sensors for determining the presence of a container, a type of container, and/or a volume or weight of a container. In another embodiment, the sorting machine includes one or more sensors (e.g., an optical sensor) to determine which container the item was deposited into and/or a time at which an item is deposited. Additionally, a sorting machine/station can include any of a variety of computer peripherals, such as user input devices (e.g., touch screens, keyboards, pointer devices, etc.), display devices, sound-producing devices (e.g., speakers or buzzers), or any other peripheral device.</p>
  <p num="p-0104">In many embodiments, several container types are provided, each type being associated with one or more particular categories or classifications of pharmaceutical waste. In one embodiment, a single container is associated with a single waste category. In another embodiment, a single container is associated with multiple waste categories.</p>

Additional container types can also be used as desired. In one embodiment, the container types are pre-designated by the container provider. In other embodiments, the container types are assigned by the hospital so that the hospital can individually customize its waste sorting system. For example, some hospitals may desire to define their own waste categories in order to comply with internal goals, thus user-defined container types can also be provided.</p>
  <p num="p-0106">In a preferred embodiment, a waste identifying mechanism is provided. In several embodiments, the waste identifying mechanism is configured to identify a particular item of waste. Identification is preferably accomplished prior to deposit into the appropriate container. Identification of the waste item can be accomplished by scanning a barcode, reading a label (e.g., using an optical scanner and Optical Character Recognition software), reading a Radio Frequency identification (RFID) tag, chemical sensors, spectroscopic analyzers, or by measuring or evaluating any other qualitative parameter of the waste item presented for identification. Alternatively still, an item of waste can be identified by user input of information such as a trade name, a generic name, a chemical name, National Drug Code (NDC), the abbreviated name of the drug (or mnemonic), or other data associated with a particular item of waste. For example, a 325 mg dose of aspirin can be identified by ASPIOT3272. In one embodiment, a user can simply read a waste identifier from an item of medical waste and enter the identifier into the system via a keyboard, touch screen or other user input device.</p>
  <p num="p-0107">In one embodiment, once an item of waste is identified, the sorting algorithm determines to which of a plurality of waste categories the item belongs. The station then indicates to the user which container is associated with that category. For example, in some embodiments the station indicates a correct container by opening a door providing access to the container. Alternatively, such an indication can be provided by illuminating a light or displaying a name or number of a container on a display device. In some embodiments, a waste sorting mechanism can carry out or instruct a user in delivery of the waste item to the appropriate container.</p>
  <p num="p-0108">In some embodiments, the waste sorting mechanism comprises a plurality of openings providing access to the plurality of containers. For example, each of the containers can be configured to interface with an automatically operable door or other means to present the container opening to the user. Some embodiments of such an interface are described in further detail below. Alternatively, the sorting machine can be configured to provide access to an appropriate container in other ways, such as by moving a container relative to the machine in order to present a container opening to a user. In further alternative embodiments, the sorting mechanism can include a series of lights or other indicators configured to inform a user of the correct container for a particular item of waste. Alternatively still, the sorting mechanism can include an apparatus configured to receive an item of waste from a user and physically convey the item to the appropriate container, which may be removable.</p>
  <p num="p-0109">In some embodiments, a single waste item may call for disposal in multiple containers. For example, a syringe might contain a quantity of a hazardous or controlled substance, which requires disposal in a first container. However, the syringe itself may require disposal in a second, separate container. In such embodiments, it is desirable for the system to determine an appropriate sequence for the disposal of the separate parts of a single item. In the event that a waste item contains information (such as a barcode or label) sufficient to inform the system of the need for a sequence of disposal steps, the system can determine the optimum sequence, and can then inform the user of the appropriate sequence. The system may inform a user of the appropriate sequence by sequentially opening appropriate doors and/or by displaying instructions on a display screen. In one embodiment, a means can be provided for the user to indicate whether an item of waste is empty or contains residual or bulk hazardous or non-hazardous contents.</p>
  <p num="p-0110">Alternatively, it may be desirable for a user to determine the best sequence for disposal, in which case, the user may enter information into the system requesting a particular sequence. Additionally, it may also be desirable for the system to include “shortcut keys” in order to provide quick access to frequently-used containers, such as sharps containers. Such shortcut keys can be configured to quickly open a selected container.</p>
  <p num="p-0111">In some embodiments, when a single waste item comprises a composite of elements falling into different waste categories, such as a syringe containing a controlled substance, which might, if disposed separately, be sorted into two different containers, the waste sorting system can indicate disposal of the composite waste item into the correct container. In this manner, when it is inefficient, ineffective or even dangerous to separate the single composite waste item into its individual components, hospitals can still achieve compliance by disposing of such hybrid or composite items into the most conservative hazard container. In some embodiments, if a composite waste item could be deposited in more than one container, the containers within a sorting station can be ranked in order from “less” to “more” desirable in order to facilitate a determination of which container is the “most appropriate” hazard container in a given station. A determination of whether a particular container type (and corresponding waste category or categories) is more or less appropriate can be determined by a variety of suitable methods. In some cases, a selection priority can be determined empirically, while in other embodiments, the choice may be determined by comparing properties, such as amount of residual content, relative chemical toxicity, etc. bioactivity, etc., of elements of a particular waste item.</p>
  <p num="p-0112">In some embodiments, when a waste item is unrecognized by the identification means, the sorting system will indicate disposal to the highest hazard waste container. The system will notify the disposer that the waste item was unrecognized. In another embodiment, the sorting system may also notify a database or database personnel that the waste item is unrecognized, thus facilitating a database upgrade to include that waste item for future disposals. In one embodiment, the system may be equipped with a dedicated container that is exclusively used for disposing such unrecognized waste items. The subsequent handling of waste items in such a dedicated container may depend on regulatory requirements, the facility's personal preferences or any other relevant consideration.</p>
  <p num="p-0113">In another embodiment, a waste item identification device is configured to receive a waste item identifier from a waste item, and a decision system is configured to assign the waste item to a waste category using the waste identifier and information contained in the classification database. Each of the containers is associated with at least one of the waste categories, and the decision system is further configured to indicate into which of the containers a waste item should be deposited based on the waste category. The decision system is further configured to open an alternate container if the station does not include a container associated with the assigned category. In one embodiment, for example, the alternate container is a container associated with the highest hazardous level will be opened. In another embodiment, the alternate container is a container associated with the “next best” disposal category for the waste item.</p>
  <p num="p-0114">In one embodiment, the alternate container is located adjacent to the preferred (or “first choice”) container. In another embodiment, the alternate container is located in a different location from the preferred container. For example, the alternate container can be located in a different room or on a different floor. In yet another embodiment, if an alternate container is unavailable, then the item may be rejected. In this situation, the user may be instructed to obtain additional information on disposal.</p>
  <p num="p-0115">Each of the containers is associated with at least one of the waste categories, and the decision system is further configured to indicate into which of the containers a waste item should be deposited based on the waste category. The decision system is further configured to open an alternate container if the station does not include a container associated with the assigned category. In one embodiment, for example, the alternate container is a container associated with the highest hazardous level will be opened. In another embodiment, the alternate container is a container associated with the “next best” disposal category for the waste item.</p>
  <p num="p-0116">In one embodiment, the alternate container is located adjacent to the preferred (or “first choice”) container. In another embodiment, the alternate container is located in a different location from the preferred container. For example, the alternate container can be located in a different room or on a different floor of a hospital or other institution.</p>
  <p num="p-0117">In some embodiments, it may be advantageous to determine the quantity of waste that has already been deposited into one or more containers. In some embodiments, one or more sensors are used to quantitatively assess one or more parameters of the container and/or waste. These quantitative sensors include, but are not limited to, sensors that detect the weight, volume, density, and/or fill level of the waste in the container.</p>
  <p num="p-0118">In one embodiment, one or more fill sensors are provided. A fill level sensor can be used to monitor a fill level of each of the containers to determine when a particular container is full. Once a container is determined to be full, the sorting system can signal a user to replace the full container with a new empty container. Additionally, once a particular container is full, some embodiments of the system can be configured to determine the weight or volume of waste material within the full container. The system can also be configured to print a label to be affixed to the container. The label can include a variety of information relating to the disposal of the waste items, the quantity, weight or volume of the items contained therein, a waste category name or code, etc. In other embodiments, the system may be configured to alert a user of other nearby waste containers capable of accepting the waste.</p>
  <p num="p-0119">In some embodiments, quantitative sensors are not used. Instead, in one embodiment, the quantity of waste is determined by direct visualization of the waste in a container. Transparent or translucent containers are provided to facilitate visualization in some embodiments. In several embodiments, the containers are opaque, but provide a section or “view-strip” of translucent or transparent material to permit visualization. In one embodiment, one or more sensors are provided in conjunction with means to directly visualize waste quantity. In one embodiment, means for detecting a quantity of waste are not needed because the containers are replaced at regularly scheduled intervals, as determined by a waste transport company, a disposal company or hospital staff and independent of how much waste is in any given container.</p>
  <p num="p-0120">In some embodiments, when a new container is placed in a sorting and disposal station, the system can be configured to identify the new container according to the type of waste the container it is permitted to hold. In some embodiments, a waste sorting and disposal station can be configured to recognize containers in a static mode in which each container position within the station/machine is associated with a specific container type. Upon insertion of a new container into the station, the system can recognize the type of container and can determine whether the new container is the correct type for the position in which it was placed. Thus, a system of this type can insure that a consistent arrangement of container types is maintained.</p>
  <p num="p-0121">Alternatively, and more preferably, a sorting and disposal station is configured to recognize container types in a dynamic mode in which the machine is able to recognize and adapt to changing container arrangements. Thus, according to this embodiment, each container position/compartment in a station will recognize and accept any new container regardless of the container type, and the software will adapt a sorting routine to account for the new configuration. In some cases, it may be desirable for a single station to have multiple containers of a single type. For example, an oncology department may desire several chemotherapy containers and no hazardous pharmaceutical containers, while an area of the hospital that does not use chemotherapeutic drugs may want several sharps containers and no chemotherapy containers. This allows for substantial flexibility and customizability in system set up. In further embodiments, a sorting and disposal station can exhibit aspects of both static and dynamic systems, such as by allowing any type of container in any container position, while requiring a minimum number of containers of a particular type.</p>
  <p num="p-0122">In some embodiments, the waste sorting and disposal system can be significantly simplified by appropriately labeling of products that will eventually be disposed as waste. For example, in one embodiment, a prescription drug label may provide disposal information at the time the label is generated. For example, the drug vial or other pharmaceutical product label may indicate in what waste category the item should be disposed. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>, in one embodiment, the label may provide alternative waste categories under which it should be disposed, depending on whether the item is empty or not empty and/or whether the items is or is not a sharps. Such waste categorization information printed on such labels may be obtained from a waste disposal database as discussed herein.</p>
  <p num="p-0123">For example, in one embodiment, an institution may print its own specific labels that are based on waste categories. In one embodiment, multiple labels are generated, each with its own simple code (color, numerals, letters, etc) and affixed to a drug vial. At the time of disposal, the scanner (which is configured to read these institution specific codes) is able to associate the waste item with the appropriate waste container. In one embodiment, a scanner is not needed. Rather, the user can read the symbol and dispose of the waste accordingly.</p>
  <p num="h-0007">Network-Implemented System</p>
  <p num="p-0124">In some embodiments, a waste sorting and disposal system can be configured on a hospital-wide level by providing a plurality of cooperating sorting and disposal stations throughout the hospital. The system can include a plurality of individual sorting and disposal stations in a variety of types, arrangements, sizes, functionalities, etc.</p>
  <p num="p-0125"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a centralized waste sorting and disposal network. As shown, a centralized network <b>50</b> can include a main central unit <b>54</b> provided in electronic communication with a plurality of smaller “satellite” units <b>60</b> throughout a facility. In such a centralized network, the main unit <b>54</b> can include a server containing the classification database <b>56</b> and any other information to be shared with the satellite units <b>60</b>. As information is needed by a satellite unit <b>60</b>, it can query the database via the network in order to obtain that information. Alternatively, or in addition, the main unit <b>54</b> can be configured to push updates to the satellite units at regular intervals, or as new information becomes available. In some embodiments, the main unit <b>54</b> can also act as a central hub for various communications, tracking, maintenance and other system functions.</p>
  <p num="p-0126"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a de-centralized medical waste sorting and disposal system. The network <b>64</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is substantially decentralized and comprises a plurality of sorting and disposal stations <b>60</b> which can communicate with one another according to any suitable method. For example, in a decentralized network, each of the individual units may locally store a copy of the classification database. In order to keep the classification database updated, the individual units can share information with one another according to any of a variety of peer-to-peer network protocols. The individual stations can also share other information with one another as will be further described below.</p>
  <p num="p-0127">In either case (centralized or decentralized network), the network elements can be configured to communicate with one another via any suitable wired and/or wireless network communication protocol. Many hospitals already have existing wired and/or wireless networks connecting computers and communications devices throughout the facility. Thus, in some embodiments, a networked medical waste sorting and disposal system can be configured as an add-on to an existing network. Alternatively, a networked medical waste sorting and disposal system can be configured as an independent network. Additionally, the main unit (if present) and/or the satellite unit(s) can further be connected to external networks (e.g., the internet) via wireless or wired connections as desired, consistent with a hospital protocol.</p>
  <p num="p-0128">In some embodiments, it may be desirable for one sorting and disposal station to have access to information about one or all of the other stations in the network. For instance, it may be desirable for any one station to determine an arrangement of containers in one or more nearby stations. For example, if a clinician presents an item of waste to a station which does not presently have a container suitable for disposal of the presented item, that station can direct the clinician to the nearest station that does have an appropriate container installed. In further embodiments, a log of such re-directions can be kept in order to increase efficiency by arranging the sorting and disposal stations to include the most frequently used containers for a given location.</p>
  <p num="p-0129">Some embodiments of a waste sorting and disposal system are configured to communicate information directly to a technician, maintenance person, clinician or other person. For example, the system can be configured to alert a maintenance person when a container is full by sending an alert signal to a pager, cell phone, PDA, computer terminal, or any other suitable device. The maintenance person can then remove the full container and replace it with an empty container (of the same or a different type).</p>
  <p num="h-0008">Individual Sorting/Disposal Stations</p>
  <p num="p-0130">A medical waste sorting and disposal station can take a variety of forms depending on the specific needs of a given clinic, hospital, department, clinician, etc. For example, some embodiments of sorting and disposal stations <b>60</b> are illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-12</figref>. For example, a station can be provided in a wall-mounted unit <b>60</b> <i>a </i>(e.g., see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), in a floor-standing unit <b>60</b> <i>b </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), on a wheeled cart <b>60</b> <i>c </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>), attached to a patient bed, attached to an IV pole, attached to an existing wheeled medications cart <b>60</b> <i>d </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref>), or any of a variety of other shapes, forms and mounting locations.</p>
  <p num="p-0131">The embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> also includes a display device <b>70</b>, a weight scale <b>72</b>, a scanner <b>74</b> for identifying waste items and a plurality of apertures <b>78</b> configured to reveal openings to respective containers <b>80</b>. In other embodiments, the apertures are designed to selectively occlude and reveal openings or access ports.</p>
  <p num="p-0132">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref>, some embodiments of a station can comprise a movable lid <b>82</b> with a single aperture <b>84</b>. The lid <b>82</b> can be substantially flexible such that it can be driven to translate above the containers in order to selectively provide access to any one of the containers below the lid <b>82</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0133">In some embodiments, the sorting machine can be configured to provide access to an appropriate container in other ways, such as by tilting, raising, lowering, pivoting, translating or otherwise moving a container relative to the machine in order to present the container opening to a user.</p>
  <p num="p-0134"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates an embodiment in which a sorting station comprises a series of hinged sleeves <b>86</b> configured to pivot relative to a fixed portion of the sorting station. Each sleeve <b>86</b> is generally configured to temporarily house a container <b>80</b>, which may be removable. The station <b>60</b> <i>e </i>comprises a series of actuators configured to pivot each sleeve <b>86</b> and its associated container <b>80</b> outwards, thereby exposing the container opening <b>88</b>. In one embodiment, an actuator <b>90</b> can be located adjacent an upper portion of a container <b>80</b> and can be configured to push the upper portion of the container outwards from the station. Alternatively the sleeve <b>86</b> can be biased outwards by a spring or simply by gravity, and an upper actuator can be configured to release the sleeve/container to allow it to pivot outwards to open. The upper actuator can then pull inwards to return the container/sleeve to a closed position.</p>
  <p num="p-0135">Alternatively or in addition, a lower actuator <b>92</b> can be provided adjacent a bottom portion of the container/sleeve combination. In one embodiment, a lower actuator <b>92</b> can comprise a drive axle <b>94</b> rigidly mounted to the sleeve <b>86</b>. The axle <b>94</b> can be driven by a motor or other mechanism in order to pivot the sleeve <b>86</b> inwards and outwards. A container <b>80</b> can be inserted into the sleeve <b>86</b> and pivoted back so that a fixed portion of the station <b>60</b> <i>e </i>covers the container opening <b>88</b>. During use, the actuator <b>90</b> or <b>92</b> causes the sleeve <b>86</b> to pivot outward from the station <b>60</b> <i>e</i>, thereby exposing the container opening for use. The container <b>80</b> can be removed by sliding it out of the sleeve <b>86</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the above system can be provided without a sleeve <b>86</b> by incorporating an actuator and a pivot point into the container itself. In further alternative embodiments, other actuators, drive mechanisms, etc can be used in order to selectively provide access to a container opening.</p>
  <p num="p-0136">In another embodiment, the station can be configured to house each of the containers in a sliding drawer. The drawers can include actuators configured to move the drawer outwards until an opening is exposed. The containers can then be easily removed once they are full.</p>
  <p num="p-0137"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> illustrate another embodiment of a waste sorting and disposal station <b>60</b> <i>f </i>in the form of a convertible rolling cart. In a first orientation, illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the station <b>60</b> <i>f </i>is a two-sided rolling cart. The station <b>60</b> <i>f </i>of this embodiment can be provided with a hinge <b>96</b> configured to allow the two sides <b>98</b> <i>a</i>, <b>98</b> <i>b </i>of the cart <b>60</b> <i>f </i>to unfold into a one-sided arrangement. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows the cart in an unfolded form, so that it may be placed or mounted against a wall. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows the cart in a folded form, and thus suitable for use as a cart.</p>
  <p num="p-0138">In some embodiments, a sorting and disposal station <b>60</b> can include a scale configured to determine a weight of a full container. Thus, a scale <b>72</b> can be provided on an upper or other accessible portion of the station. Alternatively, the station can include a scale (e.g., a load cell) to continuously or repeatedly weigh each container within the station. Such information can be useful in creating a manifest for the containers before transportation of the containers to an appropriate disposal facility. Additionally, or alternatively, a station can include a fill level sensor for continuously or intermittently determining a fill level of a container. Embodiments of a fill-level sensor are described in further detail below.</p>

In a further embodiment, the container is opened manually, and closes automatically. Automatic closure of the container can be based on a pre-determined time interval. Alternatively, once a waste item is disposed within the container, the container may use one or more sensors to determine that the waste has been appropriately discarded, and automatically closes upon this sensor determination. In yet another embodiment, the user can communicate to the system (e.g., by pressing a button) to close the container automatically.</p>
  <p num="h-0009">Containers</p>
  <p num="p-0154">In some embodiments, the containers are generally designed to be low cost, yet include features that provide a functional interface with mechanisms in a sorting station to perform several desired functions. For example, in some embodiments, each container includes a door or lid which can be opened and closed automatically in order to allow or prevent access to a particular container at a particular time. Additionally, the containers can be configured to interface with sensors for determining a quantity of contents within the container, and/or sensors for determining a type of container.</p>
  <p num="p-0155">In some embodiments, the containers <b>80</b> are blow molded (or otherwise formed) from polypropylene, high molecular weight polyethylene, polyvinylchloride or any other suitable plastic or other material as desired. In some embodiments, the containers <b>80</b> have substantially frosted or translucent side walls. The containers will typically be sized to have an internal volume of anywhere from 1 to 20 gallons, however greater or smaller volumes can also be used as desired. For example, in some particular embodiments, containers can be provided in 1-gallon, 2-gallon, 3-gallon, 5-gallon, 8-gallon, and 13-gallon sizes. Other sizes can also be used.</p>
  <p num="p-0156">The shape of the containers can vary widely. In some preferred embodiments, the containers include a lifting handle, a primary opening which can be automatically and/or manually closed or sealed, and a bottom surface configured to allow the container to stand upright. Additionally, the containers can also include features such as an automatically-openable door or lid, a manually closable lid, features for accurately locating the container in a container compartment of a station, a viewing window for visually verifying fill level, and/or identification information for informing a user of a container's contents (or intended contents).</p>
  <p num="p-0157">The containers can be provided with an opening <b>88</b> having a variety of shapes and/or features. For example, in one embodiment, the opening <b>88</b> is substantially circular and has a minimum internal diameter of at least about three inches (˜76 mm). In other embodiments, the opening <b>88</b> can be substantially elliptical, rectangular, polygonal or otherwise shaped, and can be any suitable size, including sizes smaller than three inches in diameter. The particular type or types of waste to be deposited in a particular container can be a significant factor that can be used in determining a suitable size and/or shape of a container opening. In general, the container opening should be sized to easily accept the largest waste item that is expected to be deposited in the container. For example, some containers might receive full or partially full liter-sized IV bags, gallon-sized biohazard bags or other large items. It is generally desirable that the container opening be configured to accept these large items easily and without tearing the bags or otherwise damaging or causing spillage of a waste item. The skilled artisan will recognize that other factors may also affect a choice of container opening size or shape.</p>
  <p num="p-0158">In some embodiments, containers are provided in a plurality of types, each type corresponding to a respective waste category or waste classification. In order to allow clinicians, maintenance people, and any other persons who may handle the containers to quickly and easily differentiate containers of various types, the containers can be color-coded to correspond with a particular type or category of waste. In some embodiments, a color-coding scheme can be selected to match industry standards for various types of medical waste. Red, for example, typically signifies infectious waste, while yellow typically signifies chemotherapeutic waste. Color-coded containers can advantageously simplify the tasks associated with manual transportation and processing of the containers, and can aid in ensuring that such tasks will be handled correctly for each waste stream.</p>
  <p num="p-0159">Alternatively, such visual verification of a container's type can be provided by any other suitable method. For example, the various container types can be indicated by labels bearing numeric, alphanumeric, graphical or symbolic information. Such labels can include printed stick-on labels or various features molded or formed directly into portions of the containers themselves. If desired, such type-identification features can be provided in addition to color-coding of the containers in order to further simplify identification of a container's type. Providing simple visual verification of a given container's type advantageously simplifies and facilitates handling of medical waste materials throughout many aspects of collection and disposal.</p>
  <p num="p-0160">In some embodiments, the containers can be configured in such a way that a sorting and disposal station can automatically identify a type of container. Such automation allows a station/machine to detect the mix and arrangement of container types in the station at any given time. In some embodiments, each container includes an identification key that can be read by corresponding structures in a sorting station. The key generally allows the sorting station to automatically identify the type of each container occupying a compartment or container position within the station. As discussed above, the station can be configured to identify container types in either a static or dynamic mode depending on a desired degree of flexibility for a given station.</p>
  <p num="p-0161">Identification keys may be physical features such as fingers molded into or attached to each container. Alternatively, identification keys can be holes, notches, or grooves molded or cut into a portion of each container. In some embodiments, identification keys include optically-readable features such as holes, dark or light colored dots, text, symbols, graphics, etc. A physical key may be configured to be read by mechanical or optical switches associated with each compartment or container position within the station. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a container <b>80</b> with an identification key <b>104</b> made up of a series of holes <b>110</b> in a flange <b>112</b> extending from an upper portion of the container <b>80</b>. The holes <b>110</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> can be detected by a plurality of optical switches <b>138</b> mounted to a portion of the station adjacent a container position. Thus the various container types can be identified by providing holes (or other features) in varying combinations and positions.</p>
  <p num="p-0162">Alternatively, a key may be an optical mark, such as a bar code, that can be interpreted by a sensor such as a bar code reader. Alternatively still, the key may be a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag that can be read by a transponder associated with each compartment. In still further embodiments, container identification keys can comprise microchips, magnetic strips, or other electronic media that can be read by a waste sorting and disposal station into which the container is placed. In one alternative embodiment, a polychromatic sensitive optical sensor can be provided to directly determine a color of a container.</p>
  <p num="p-0163">As discussed above, some embodiments of a container are provided with automatically operable doors. In such embodiments, a container can be closed by default to prevent insertion of items into an incorrect container. Then, once an item is scanned or otherwise identified, the station can open the appropriate container or otherwise signify the single correct container to receive that particular waste item.</p>
  <p num="p-0164"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-17</figref> illustrate embodiments of containers comprising integrally-formed automatically operable doors and corresponding structures in a sorting station. The illustrated structures are generally configured to provide an automated interface between a container <b>80</b> and portions of a sorting and disposal station in order to allow the station to automatically recognize and operate a container. According to these illustrated embodiments, each compartment includes an actuator mechanism configured to automatically and selectively open and close the corresponding container <b>80</b>. The selective opening and closing of each container may be accomplished via interaction of structures on both the container and the station, and can ultimately be controlled by a computer system within the sorting and disposal station.</p>
  <p num="p-0165">In some embodiments, a container may include a movable lid molded or otherwise joined to the container opening. The lid can generally be configured to pivot, slide, hinge or rotate relative to a container in order to reveal or cover the container opening. In some embodiments, the lid is configured to mate with a mechanical actuator in the station upon installation of the container in a given container compartment. The actuator can be configured to allow the lid to open and close by translating, rotating or pivoting the lid. The actuator and lid can be further configured to separate from one another when the container is removed from the station.</p>
  <p num="p-0166"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates one embodiment of an interface between a container <b>80</b> and portions of a sorting station. In the illustrated embodiment, the container <b>80</b> comprises a gate <b>116</b> covering an opening <b>88</b> and configured to slide in tracks <b>118</b> between an open position and a closed position. The gate <b>116</b> can include a latch <b>120</b> configured to lock (e.g., automatically lock) the container opening when the gate <b>116</b> is completely closed. When a new container <b>80</b> is inserted into a station, a drive pin <b>122</b> on the gate control arm <b>124</b> is engaged by the gate <b>116</b> of container. The control arm <b>124</b> is configured to open and close the gate <b>116</b>. The gate control arm <b>124</b> can be coupled to a drive motor <b>128</b> via a transmission element such as a disc <b>132</b> or a similarly functioning arm. If desired, a position switch <b>134</b> can also be provided on the disc <b>132</b>, control arm <b>124</b>, gate <b>116</b> or other component in order to detect a position of the gate <b>116</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the position switch <b>134</b> is an optical switch configured to detect one or more holes <b>136</b> in the disc <b>132</b>. Additionally, the sorting station can include a plurality of optical switches <b>138</b> for detecting the presence of a container and/or the type of container <b>80</b> inserted into the sorting station. The embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> replaces the gate control arm <b>124</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> with a slot <b>140</b> in the gate <b>116</b> in order to convert the rotational motion of the pin <b>142</b> extending from the disc <b>132</b> into linear motion of the gate <b>116</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0167">In alternative embodiments, other configurations of automatically openable doors/gates can be provided. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of a container comprising a sectioned door <b>150</b> configured to slide along tracks <b>152</b> extending from the exterior surface of the container <b>80</b>. The slidable lids of the above embodiments can be provided with a latch (such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>) which can be automatically engaged in order to lock the container once a sorting station determines the container is full. The embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> can include a slidable door <b>116</b> driven by a rack and pinion drive mechanism <b>156</b>. Alternatively, the drive mechanism <b>156</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> can comprise a driven friction wheel configured to engage a portion of the slidable lid <b>116</b>. A similar pinion or friction wheel drive system can be used to automatically operate the sectioned door <b>150</b> of the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a container <b>80</b> with a lid <b>158</b> configured to open by pivoting relative to the container <b>80</b>. In further alternative embodiments, a door can be opened or closed by any of a variety of other mechanisms. For example, worm screws, pneumatic pistons, hydraulic pistons, solenoids, or any other motion-transferring mechanism can be used to selectively open and close a container door.</p>
  <p num="p-0168">In some embodiments it may also be desirable to provide an outer lid configured to seal a container opening once the container is full. The outer lid is preferably configured to attach to the container sufficiently securely to prevent spillage or tampering. An outer seal also shields users from contaminants that may have come in contact with the container top area during use. For example, in some embodiments a flexible lid can be configured to seal over a top of the automatically actuated door by frictionally engaging a lip, groove, or other structure in a manner similar to many flexible lids used in food storage containers. In alternative embodiments, outer seals can be provided in the form of a bag or shrink-wrap material that surrounds a substantial portion of a container's exterior.</p>
  <p num="p-0169">In some embodiments, it may be desirable to provide a container configured to render waste items non-recoverable by providing a substance within an “empty” container that can react chemically with waste items. In another embodiment, a solidifying agent can be provided within a container in order to solidify non-hazardous pharmaceuticals allowing for their disposal in a landfill. In some embodiments, such solidifying agents can include materials capable of absorbing a quantity of a liquid non-hazardous pharmaceutical material. For example, such absorbent materials can include ceramic materials, sponge materials or other porous materials. Alternatively, such solidification may involve a chemical reaction between the waste material and a substance provided within the container.</p>
  <p num="h-0010">Fill-Level Detection System</p>
  <p num="p-0170">In some embodiments, it is desirable to measure a fill level of waste within a container throughout the sorting and filling process. In some embodiments, such fill level sensing can be performed by measuring a weight of a container, such as by using a load cell, balance, or other weight measurement device. In further embodiments, float systems can be adapted for use in determining a level of a waste material in a waste sorting system. In some cases, it is also desirable to perform such fill level measurements without the sensor physically contacting the container or the container contents.</p>
  <p num="p-0171">Level sensors are commonly used in many fields to determine a quantity of a solid or liquid within a container. Three popular level sensors include floats, sight glasses and ultrasonic systems.</p>
  <p num="p-0172">In a float system, a buoyant device or “float” is placed in the container, where it remains partially submerged in the liquid retained within the container. The float is used to detect a level of a fluid in the container by activating a switch located at a pre-determined point. Alternatively, the float detects the container's fluid level by activating a potentiometer, which reports the fluid level over a calibrated range.</p>
  <p num="p-0173">Sight glass type level sensors evolved from manual systems in which an operator observed the level in a container through a transparent window. Sight glass type sensors which today are implemented using light sensors, generally require a window through which to project and receive light.</p>
  <p num="p-0174">Ultrasonic fill level sensors direct a beam of ultrasonic energy toward an object and detect the time delay associated with that beam of energy reflecting off the object and returning to the sensor. Thus, the time delay correlates to a particular height of the contents in the container.</p>
  <p num="p-0175">The assignee of the present application also owns technology related to the optical detection of the level of material in a translucent plastic waste container. See, e.g., applications Ser. Nos. 10/945,223; 10/946,252; 10/946,161; 10/945,773; 10/946,164; 10/946,207; 10/946,208; and 10/946,054, herein incorporated by reference. As described below, in some embodiments, measurements are made by illuminating one side of the container and collecting the light received by an array of photo detectors located on the opposite side of the container. In one embodiment, a microprocessor interprets the light received at the array of receptors, compensates for ambient light and the relative transmissivity of individual containers, and determines whether the container is full.</p>
  <p num="p-0176">In some embodiments, a piezo transducer can be used to determine a volume of air remaining in a container by conducting a frequency sweep of the transducer to determine the resonance of the air in the container. Once the volume of air in the container is known, the air volume can be subtracted from the known total container volume to obtain the volume occupied by the container contents. In another alternative embodiment, a distance-measuring sensor (such as SONAR, RADAR or optical distance-measuring sensors) can be located above and directed through the opening of the container in order to determine a “height” of the container contents. In another embodiment, a sensor can be provided for determining whether a container includes any waste at all. Such a “waste presence” sensor can be used in combination with a timer to determine a replacement schedule for a particular container based on a maximum acceptable dwell time for a particular waste item in a container. Still other embodiments may use optical sensors to measure a fill level of a container.</p>
  <p num="p-0177"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-19</figref> illustrate one embodiment of a level sensor which can be used to automatically determine a fill level of a container using an optical method. As shown in the schematic illustration of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, one embodiment of a fill level sensing system comprises a light source <b>230</b> and a light detector <b>232</b> positioned on opposite sides of a container <b>80</b>. In alternative embodiments, the light detector <b>232</b> need not be located immediately opposite the light source, for example, in some embodiments the detector can be located on a wall adjacent to the source <b>230</b>. The sensor system of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref> generally operates on the principle that an “empty” container will permit more light to pass from the source, through the container, and to the sensor than will a “full” container. This is simply due to the fact that the contents of the container <b>80</b> will absorb and/or reflect a substantial portion of the light which enters the container from a light source.</p>
  <p num="p-0178">As used herein, the terms “empty” and “full” shall be given their ordinary meaning and shall be used to define relative amounts of debris, or other matter, in a container. For example, in certain embodiments, the sensor may indicate that the container is ready to be emptied or discarded, not because it is completely saturated, but because it has reached the desired point of fill or saturation. In some situations, it may be desirous to empty or remove a container when anywhere from about 1% to about 100%, often from about 25% to about 100% of that container contains waste material. In other situations, it may be desirable to remove a container when about 50% to about 95% of its volume is occupied by waste material.</p>
  <p num="p-0179">In some other embodiments, a parameter other than weight or filled volume may be used to determine when a container is “full.” For example, in one embodiment, a sensor to detect radioactivity is used to determine the amount of radioisotope in a container or receptacle. The radioactivity sensor may be used in connection with a fill sensor, or it may be used alone. Thus, in some embodiments, a container may be emptied, discarded, or replaced based on a certain amount of radioactivity, rather than (or in addition to) the surface area, volume, weight, density and/or another parameter of the material in that container.</p>
  <p num="p-0180">In yet another embodiment, a sorting and disposal system can be provided without any automatic level detection apparatus. For example, in such an embodiment, the containers can be configured to allow a clinician, maintenance person, or other user to visually verify a fill level of the container. In such embodiments, the containers can be made of a substantially transparent or translucent material. Alternatively, the containers may be substantially opaque but can include a transparent viewing window to allow visual verification of a fill level. Such viewing windows could extend substantially an entire height of the container, or could extend only a height of a desired portion of the container.</p>
  <p num="p-0181">In some embodiments, the source <b>230</b> and detector <b>232</b> are located along a “fill line” which generally defines a “fill plane.” The fill plane <b>240</b> is generally the level within the container <b>80</b> which a processor <b>242</b> defines as “full.” In some embodiments, the actual free surface of contents within a container may not necessarily be planar. In such embodiments, the “fill plane” used by the processor and fill level sensing system is simply an average height of the material.</p>
  <p num="p-0182">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, a light source <b>230</b> is located at a “front” of the container and a detector <b>232</b> is located at a “rear” of the container. In alternative embodiments, the positions of the light source <b>230</b> and detector <b>232</b> can be reversed, or positioned at any other position around the container <b>80</b>. In still further embodiments, multiple sources and/or detectors can also be used as desired.</p>
  <p num="p-0183">As discussed above, the containers <b>80</b> are typically made of a translucent material which allows at least some amount of light to pass through its walls. The embodiments of a fill level sensor illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref> are particularly advantageous when used to measure a fill level of a container with translucent sidewalls. However, the skilled artisan will recognize that certain advantages of the embodiments described herein may be advantageously applied to systems using containers having transparent sidewalls or containers with transparent windows in otherwise relatively opaque sidewalls. As used herein, the term “translucent” is used in its ordinary sense and refers without limitation to a material which allows the diffuse transmission of light when illuminated, while remaining substantially non-transparent when not illuminated.</p>
  <p num="p-0184">The light source can comprise any suitable source of light such as incandescent bulbs, white or colored LED's, or other sources. In some embodiments, the light source <b>230</b> is located such that it is vertically centered on a desired “fill line” <b>240</b> of the container. The light source can be laterally centered relative to the container, or can comprise a width that is about as wide as the container <b>80</b>. In still further embodiments, a plurality of light sources can be used to illuminate a container from multiple points.</p>
  <p num="p-0185">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the light detector <b>232</b> can comprise an array of photo detectors <b>236</b> such as cadmium sulfide photo detectors or photodiodes. In the illustrated embodiment, the array of photo detectors <b>236</b> comprises three rows <b>244</b>, <b>246</b> and <b>248</b> of detectors <b>236</b>. The upper row <b>244</b> contains a single detector <b>236</b> while the middle <b>246</b> and lower <b>248</b> rows contain a plurality of detectors <b>236</b> (three in the illustrated embodiment). In alternative embodiments, the upper row <b>244</b> can be provided with additional detectors which equal or exceed the number of detectors in the other rows. Similarly, the middle <b>246</b> and lower <b>248</b> rows can include fewer or more than three detectors as desired. The number of detectors in each row will typically be determined by the algorithm used to determine the fill level of the container and/or the degree of accuracy desired. In some embodiments, it may also be desirable to provide more than three rows of detectors. For example, in some embodiments, a fill level detection system can be provided with four, five or more rows of detectors.</p>
  <p num="p-0186">In some embodiments, the middle row of detectors is positioned to lie just above the fill line <b>240</b> of the container <b>80</b>, and the lower row <b>248</b> of detectors <b>236</b> is positioned just below the fill line <b>240</b>. The upper row <b>244</b> of detectors <b>236</b> can be located substantially above the fill line, and can be used to calibrate the detectors middle <b>246</b> and lower <b>248</b> rows as will be described in further detail below.</p>
  <p num="p-0187">In some embodiments, the upper and middle rows can be spaced by a distance <b>250</b> of between about ½″ and about 2 inches, in other embodiments the upper and middle rows can be spaced by a distance <b>250</b> of between about 1 inch and about 1½ inches, and in one particular embodiment, the upper and middle rows are spaced by a distance <b>250</b> of about 1¼ inches. Similarly, the middle and lower rows can be spaced by a distance <b>252</b> of between about ½″ and about 2 inches, in other embodiments, the middle and lower rows can be spaced by a distance <b>252</b> of between about 1 inch and about 1½ inches, and in one particular embodiment, the middle and lower rows are spaced by a distance <b>252</b> of about 1¼ inches. In some embodiments, the detectors <b>236</b> of the middle <b>246</b> and lower <b>248</b> rows are spaced horizontally by a distance <b>254</b> of between about ½ inch and about 3 inches, in other embodiments, the detectors <b>236</b> of the middle <b>246</b> and lower <b>248</b> rows are spaced horizontally by a distance <b>254</b> of between about 1 inch and about 2 inches, and in one particular embodiment by a horizontal distance <b>254</b> of about 1½ inches. In some embodiments, the sensors are evenly spaced, while in other embodiments, the sensors of the middle row are horizontally spaced differently than the sensors of the lower row. In further alternative embodiments, the spacing of the detectors <b>236</b> can be determined by factors such as the size of the container or the material to be placed within the container.</p>
  <p num="p-0188">In operation, the individual photo detectors <b>236</b> pick up light transmitted through the container and output corresponding signals to a processor <b>242</b>. On one hand, the light intensity arriving at the detectors <b>236</b> depends on the fill level of the container <b>80</b>. In addition, a number of secondary factors also affect the light intensity reaching the detectors <b>236</b>. These include the strength of the light source <b>230</b>, the color and opacity of the container <b>80</b>, the amount of ambient light, and other factors such as dust in the air. The light intensity at the top detector row <b>244</b> is almost completely governed by these secondary factors, since it is located well above the fill line <b>240</b>. By contrast, the light intensity arriving at the middle <b>246</b> and lower <b>248</b> detector rows will be affected more by the fill level of the container contents as the container <b>80</b> becomes more full (e.g., as the fill level approaches the fill line).</p>
  <p num="p-0189">When the container <b>80</b> is empty and the overall light intensity is greatest, a baseline reading is recorded and calibration coefficients are generated for each of the detectors <b>236</b> and detector rows <b>244</b>, <b>246</b>, <b>248</b>. As the container fills, the received light reaching the detectors decreases slightly as material in the container blocks a portion of the diffused light transmitted through the container <b>80</b>. During this phase, the top detector reading is used to compensate the readings of the middle and lower detector rows accordingly. When the container contents reach the fill line, the bottom row of detectors will be blocked by the container contents, while the middle <b>246</b> and upper <b>248</b> detector rows remain unobstructed. This results in a substantial drop in the light intensity reaching the bottom row <b>248</b> of detectors, and correspondingly, a substantial difference in signal strength between the middle <b>246</b> and lower <b>248</b> detector rows. When this signal difference reaches a pre-determined threshold level, the processor determines that the container is “full.”</p>
  <p num="p-0190">In some embodiments, the items being deposited into a container may be stacked unevenly or oddly oriented within a container so that the contents of a container vary from a neat horizontal fill level. For example, some large items, such as syringes or other contaminated medical devices, may stack oddly within a container, thereby creating voids of unfilled space in a central portion of a container, above which waste items may be stacked. Such variations in filling can lead to measurement errors. Thus, in some embodiments, a level sensing system can be provided with error processing capabilities to account for variations in orientation and/or uneven loading of a container.</p>
  <p num="p-0191">For example, in some embodiments, the signals from the plurality of detectors in each row are averaged to provide a consensus value for the respective detector row. This advantageously allows the processor to determine an average fill level in the event of an uneven fill surface. For example, in an idealized case, a container filled with a plurality of spherical particles through a hole in the top center of a regularly-shaped container will typically have a free surface in a shape of a cone with a peak at the center, and dropping off evenly in each direction. In such a case, the center detector of the lower row <b>248</b> will typically receive a lower light intensity than the detectors on either side. Thus, by using the data from all of the detectors in a horizontal row, a processor can calculate an approximate average fill level in order to prevent over-filling of the container.</p>
  <p num="p-0192">These or other error-processing techniques can also be used to compensate for manufacturing defects in a container that might result in erroneous results. For example, if a plastic container wall comprises an air bubble or a dark spot in a region adjacent one or more of the detectors, these abnormalities could cause erroneous readings by those detectors. To compensate for this, a system may give less weight (or no weight at all) to signals from detectors that are out of a statistically expected range of variation from the remaining detectors. By taking an average signal across all detectors in various combinations and/or by assigning varying weights to individual detectors, a control algorithm can teach itself to recognize and adapt to such error-causing situations in order to obtain consistent readings.</p>
  <p num="p-0193">In some embodiments, the functionality of a fill level sensing system employing a light source and a plurality of optical detectors can advantageously be enhanced by containers with “frosted” or translucent walls. Another advantage of certain embodiments of a level sensing system as described herein is that such systems can be polychromatic sensitive (e.g., configured to sense light of various colors with consistent accuracy). Thus, in addition to measuring a fill level of a container, the above-described sensors can be configured to determine a color of a container (each container color being associated with a particular container type as discussed above). In some embodiments, these and other advantages are achieved through the use of cadmium sulfide photosensitive cells. In alternative embodiments, optical level sensors can be constructed using other optical detectors, including other photoconductive cells, photo diodes, or other sensors capable of detecting light in the visible or infrared spectrum.</p>
  <p num="p-0194">In some embodiments, each one of a plurality of fill-level sensors is controlled by a single processor in a waste sorting system. In one embodiment, a plurality of photo detector arrays can be connected to a single multi-channel bus, and a plurality of light sources can be controlled by a processor. In this embodiment, the processor can illuminate a single container at a time. Thus, the detectors behind each of the “dark” containers would be at high impedance, and would therefore be out of the circuit,</p>
  <p num="p-0195">In some embodiments, a fill level sensing system employing optical sources and detectors can include an additional photo detector that is generally configured to measure changes in “ambient” light within the system in order to appropriately adjust the readings from the detector arrays measuring fill level. An ambient light detector can comprise a single optical detector, or a plurality of detectors in a circuit. In one such embodiment, an additional ambient light detector is provided within a waste sorting system in a location selected to measure any light entering the system from the exterior of the sorting system. For example, the ambient light detector can be located adjacent a container-replacement door or any other portion of the system that is open to external light.</p>
  <p num="p-0196">In one embodiment, optical detectors may be located on opposite sides of a container, or on the same side of the container.</p>
  <p num="p-0197"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a circuit schematic which can be used in building an optical fill level sensor such as that illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>. The skilled artisan will recognize that this is merely one exemplary schematic, and that alternative embodiments of the system of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref> can be built using any appropriate components.</p>
  <p num="p-0198"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20-22</figref> are flow charts illustrating embodiments of software algorithms used by a level detector for use in a sorting system. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a flow chart illustrating an overview of a level testing algorithm. When the system determines that a new container has been inserted, the level sensor establishes new baseline values for the detectors in order to define the “empty” state. The level sensing system then reads values of the detectors <b>236</b> and inputs the detector values to an inference engine (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</figref>).</p>
  <p num="p-0199">The inference engine can use a “fuzzy logic” method similar to the Sugeno method. In one embodiment, the inference engine uses a table of empirically-determined data to establish rule weights. The inference engine can also use multiple grouping of detectors in addition to individual detector levels to calculate a final fill level of the container. In some embodiments, the empirically-determined lookup table can be developed by performing various calibration experiments using an optical level sensing system to measure containers at known fill levels. In addition to any controlled experiments, the lookup table can be supplemented by analysis of information it receives during use in measuring fill levels of new containers. For example, as optical anomalies are detected and accounted for, the software can adapt to correct for them.</p>
  <p num="p-0200"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</figref> are flow charts illustrating one embodiment of an inference engine. In order to avoid misleading readings during filling, the system can be configured to determine when the detectors are at a steady state (e.g., when the movement of waste within the container drops below a threshold level). This is particularly helpful in embodiments in which a waste material is a liquid, and thus may continue moving for a period of time.</p>
  <p num="p-0201">Once steady state is reached, the inference engine compares the values of the detector readings and ultimately derives a final fill value which can be stored and/or output to a user-readable device such as a liquid crystal display. In alternative embodiments, an output of the system can include other visible, audible or tactile alerts, such as LEDs, buzzers, bells, vibrators, etc. In some embodiments, an output signal is used to notify the user that a particular container is ready to be emptied, discarded, replaced etc. In an alternative embodiment, an output signal is provided substantially continuously or at various intervals, so that the user can determine or monitor the amount of material in a given container at any given time. For example, in some embodiments, the fill-level of a container can be measured at regular intervals, such as every ten minutes, every hour, every two hours, every six hours, every 12 hours, or every 24 hours. In still further embodiments, the system can comprise a sensor (such as an optical sensor) to determine when an item is deposited into a container. Then a fill-level of the container can be measured after each item is deposited in the container.</p>
  <p num="p-0202"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of a video fill level sensing system. The embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> employs a camera <b>270</b> to continuously detect an intensity of light exiting the container from the source. In the illustrated embodiment, a light source <b>272</b> is positioned to illuminate the container <b>80</b>, and a curved mirror <b>274</b> and pinhole video camera are located adjacent another side of the container <b>80</b>. The system can also include a software-based processor <b>276</b> and other electronic hardware. In the illustrated embodiment, the light source <b>270</b> is located adjacent one vertical side of the container <b>80</b> and the camera and mirror are positioned on the opposite side of the container. In alternative embodiments, the light source <b>270</b> and camera/mirror assembly can be located on adjacent sides of the container <b>80</b>. Alternatively still, the light source <b>270</b> can be located above the container such that light is directed downward into the container, thereby allowing the waste to absorb as well as reflectively diffuse the light source onto the walls of the container <b>80</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0203">In some embodiments, the camera <b>270</b> is directed at the mirror <b>274</b> to detect light emitted from the container <b>80</b> and gathered by the mirror <b>274</b>. The curved mirror <b>274</b> provides a linearization of scanline width by distorting the optics of the camera. In one embodiment, the camera <b>270</b> is a pinhole camera, which is selected due to the depth of field this type of lens provides. In one embodiment, the curved mirror <b>274</b> has a shape substantially similar to a shoehorn, e.g., it is curved about two perpendicular axes (e.g., longitudinal and transverse axes). Alternative mirror configurations can also be used as desired. The particular curvature of the mirror <b>274</b> is determined empirically depending on the width of scanline needed and the height of the measured area (e.g., the height of the container wall). Variation in the curvature of the mirror along its length allows the scanline to be optimized in order to emphasize areas of higher interest and to de-emphasize lower interest areas. The mirror can be convexly curved at the height of higher interest areas, and concavely curved to de-emphasize lower interest areas.</p>
  <p num="p-0204">In some alternative embodiments, the light source can include bands of varying color or intensity along the height of the container in order to provide emphasis to portions of the container, or to provide “watermark” levels that can be measured against. In some embodiments, the software can be configured to interpret information received from the camera to learn about points of interest in order to further optimize a measurement algorithm. For example, rather than programming an algorithm to anticipate areas of higher or lower interest, the algorithm can be configured to recognize variations in light intensity during calibration in order to detect such areas of higher or lower interest.</p>
  <p num="p-0205">The processor and its support hardware provide the sampling of multiple luminance intensities along the wall of the container <b>80</b> adjacent the mirror <b>274</b>. The analog video signal is amplified and ground-referenced by the video amplifier. This amplified signal is scanned for a selected scanline to digitize for quantifying its luminance value. The amplified video is also applied to the Sync Separator module, which produces timing pulses for the scanline selector module. The processor receives the scanline data from the scanline selector, digitizer and sync separator. The video level sensor can determine a current fill level of the waste in the container <b>80</b> using a similar software method to that described above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a circuit schematic which can be used in building a video fill level sensor such as that illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. The skilled artisan will recognize, however, that this is merely one exemplary embodiment. In alternative embodiments, the system of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> can be built using any appropriate components.</p>
  <p num="p-0206">Many of the above embodiments of fill level sensors were described with reference to a single container. In some alternative embodiments, it may be desirable to provide a single fill level detection system configured to selectively measure a fill level of any one of a plurality of containers. For example, in one embodiment, a light source may be provided on a first side of a plurality of containers, and a light detector can be movable into a position opposite the light source of the containers. In one embodiment, this may take the form of a circular arrangement of containers in which a light detector is located at a center of a circular arrangement of containers. One or more light sources can be positioned on an outer portion of the circular arrangement such that the light source and/or the light detector is capable of measuring a fill level of each one of the plurality of containers around the circle.</p>
  <p num="p-0207">In some embodiments, the sorting system can also include a weight scale (such as a load cell, pressure transducer, mechanical scale or other device) configured to weigh either a single spent drug, container or individual segregated spent drugs. In one embodiment, the information from the scale can be sent to a printer providing a means for printing a manifest for the container. Additionally, such information could be combined with other information available to a clinician in order to determine a quantity of a drug or substance that has been used or consumed. Many hospitals are automating the dispensing of drugs. The automation is usually embodied in a piece of equipment that a doctor or nurse accesses with a patient and clinician code and the correct amount of drug is dispensed. The automation provides pharmacists, nurses, doctors and administrators with information from a database on what drugs are dispensed and to which patient. These systems can typically indicate how much of a drug was administered, but entering this information typically requires a clinician to return to the dispenser (which may be inconvenient, and thus not done regularly). This information can be quite useful because it will demonstrate any inefficiencies or mistakes in administrating the drugs as well as point out any theft of drugs. In some embodiments, a sorting and disposal system can be configured to track dispensing information because at the point of throwing the spent drug away, they are automatically providing information to a central database.</p>
  <p num="p-0208">In another embodiment, the invention comprises one or more level sensors, wherein the level sensor comprises a bar, wherein the bar is periodically adapted to pass through a container at approximately the fill level. In one embodiment, a position indicator (or other visual indicator) coupled to the bar is also provided, wherein movement of the bar causes movement of the position indicator. In some embodiments, the position indicator may be comprised of a physical flag. In one embodiment, a detector adapted to detect movement of the position indicator is also provided. Thus, in one embodiment, the invention detects movement of the bar, thereby sensing the level of waste in a container. The position indicator can be fixed, tied, attached, connected, or otherwise coupled to the bar. Physical contact between the position indicator and bar is not needed.</p>
  <p num="p-0209">In one embodiment, the container comprises a level sensor that comprises a bar, wherein the bar is adapted to pass through the container. In one embodiment, a photo-detector adapted to detect movement of the bar is also provided, thereby sensing the level of waste in a container. A position indicator, or other mechanism, may also be coupled to the bar for detection by the photo-detector. The photo-detector can be adapted to either detect transmission of light or to detect the absence of transmission. Thus, in some embodiments, the photo-detector can be a photo-interruptor. One of skill in the art will understand that several optical sensors can be used in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention. One of skill in the art will also understand that non-optical sensors (such as mechanical sensors, electrical sensors, and acoustic sensors) may also be used in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. For example, mechanical sensors, electrical sensors, and/or acoustic sensors may be used to detect the movement of the bar, and thus detect the level of waste in a container.</p>
  <p num="p-0210">In yet another embodiment, a method of detecting the level of material in a hazardous waste container is provided. In one embodiment, the method comprises passing a bar through the container at the approximate fill level, wherein the bar is coupled to a position indicator (or other mechanism), wherein the position indicator (or other mechanism) activates a photo-interruptor to determine whether the container is full. The method further comprises detecting whether the bar is free to move or is blocked by the contents, thereby detecting the level of material in a hazardous waste container.</p>
  <p num="p-0211">In a further embodiment, a method of detecting the level of material in a hazardous waste container (opaque or translucent) by passing a bar through the container is provided. In one embodiment, the bar is passed at the approximate fill level and a detector is used to determine whether the bar is free to move or is blocked by the contents. A position indicator fixed (or otherwise coupled) to the bar activates a photo-interruptor, to detect the end position and determine whether the container is full. The bar operates in conjunction with a lid, that excludes access to the contents of the container. The lid may also have a position indicator and photo-interruptor for determining its position.</p>
  <p num="p-0212">Some embodiments of the present invention can also be used for receptacles containing materials other than medical or pharmaceutical waste. Thus, in some embodiments, the level sensor can be used with non-medical, non-pharmaceutical containers, holders, or vessels.</p>
  <p num="p-0213">The level sensor apparatus, in one embodiment, comprises a bar, a position indicator tied to the bar, a photo detector, and processing electronics. The level sensor apparatus, in one embodiment, is used to determine when a container is full, thereby necessitating the need for action, such as emptying or replacing the container. The level sensor apparatus, in one embodiment, is directed at the problem of level detection in hazardous waste containers. In one embodiment, the level sensor comprises a bar, induced under spring force (or other force) to pass through a container approximately at the fill level. The bar is activated periodically, such as when the container lid is operated. Since the bar may come into contact with hazardous waste, it may become soiled in use or otherwise contaminated. In a preferred embodiment, the bar is part of the container, so that it may be disposed, or cleaned for reuse, along with the container.</p>
  <p num="p-0214">In another embodiment, a position indicator (or similar feature), is coupled to the bar, so that movement of the bar causes movement of the position indicator. In a preferred embodiment, the position indicator resides outside the container, so that the associated detecting means are not in contact with the hazardous waste. However, one of skill in the art will understand that the position indicator may also be located within the container. The position indicator can be fixed, tied, attached, connected, or otherwise coupled to the bar. However, physical contact between the position indicator and bar is not needed. Moreover, one of skill in the art will understand that a position indicator is simply provided in one exemplar embodiment, and therefore, other indicators can also be used.</p>
  <p num="p-0215">In one embodiment, a photo-interruptor, or other detecting means, is utilized to detect movement of the position indicator. In a preferred embodiment, the detector is situated on the outside the container, so that it is not in contact with the hazardous waste. However, one of skill in the art will understand that the detector may also be located within the container.</p>
  <p num="p-0216">In one embodiment, the bar is released at intervals to sweep across the container. In a preferred embodiment, the bar operates each time the lid is opened. The bar can operate in a horizontal, circular, or other motion. In a preferred embodiment, the lid and bar are both rotary, and share a common axis. Thus, both the lid and bar describe a circular motion as they rotate from the closed to the open position.</p>
  <p num="p-0217">In one embodiment, the opening forces may be applied by compression, extension, or torsion springs, or by other motive forces, such as a torque motor. In a preferred embodiment, the spring forces are provided by torsion springs.</p>
  <p num="p-0218">In one embodiment, the lid may be closed manually, by a motor, or by other means. In a preferred embodiment, the lid is closed manually. In one embodiment, in the closed position, the lid and bar are restrained by one or more latches, which control the opening of the lid by opposing the opening spring force. In a preferred embodiment, the lid is latched, and the bar is in turn restrained by the lid by an interfering stop. Thus, the latch reacts to the sum of the two spring forces. In one embodiment, when the door opens, the latch releases the lid, and both the lid and bar open simultaneously under independent spring forces. In one embodiment, as the lid is rotated closed, the bar remains in contact with the lid and is pushed along ahead of it the lid until the latch clicks into the closed position. As the lid rotates open, the bar follows the rotation of the lid.</p>
  <p num="p-0219">In yet another embodiment, if the container is not full, the lid and bar both complete their full excursion and arrive at the open position. If the container is full, the lid rotates open, but the motion of the bar is impeded by the container contents, and cannot reach the open position. Thus, according to one embodiment, the bar photo-interruptor remains unactivated, and the circuit detects a full container.</p>
  <p num="p-0220">Other embodiments that incorporate one or more level sensors are described below, in conjunction with restricted access containers.</p>
  <p num="h-0011">Sorting Algorithm</p>
  <p num="p-0221">Embodiments of a pharmaceutical waste sorting and disposal system will generally employ a waste sorting algorithm to assign each item of waste to a particular waste category and correspondingly to a particular waste container. A waste sorting algorithm can take a variety of forms, and can include a range of functionalities.</p>
  <p num="p-0222">In some embodiments, as discussed above, determination of the waste categories themselves can depend on a number of factors, including RCRA hazardous waste definitions, state and federal EPA regulations, OSHA regulations, and any institution-specific regulations. For example, RCRA definitions generally include a P list, a U list and four characteristics of hazardous waste: ignitability, corrosivity, toxicity and reactivity. Materials exhibiting each of these characteristics typically call for different handling, treatment and/or disposal. Thus, in some cases waste categories can be defined based on groups of materials that require the same or similar handling, treatment, or disposal. However, in some cases, two materials that may be handled and/or treated in a similar manner might react adversely if they are combined with one another. Thus, in further embodiments, determination of the waste categories can also depend on the combinability of materials exhibiting one or more of the above characteristics.</p>
  <p num="p-0223">Once a series of unique waste categories is established, lists of known pharmaceuticals, chemicals, materials and waste items can be selectively assigned to at least one of the waste categories. In some embodiments, as discussed above, when a waste item is presented to a sorting station, the item is identified according to a waste item identifier. Such identifiers can include a trade name, a generic name, a National Drug Code (NDC), one or more components or ingredients of the item, or any other sufficiently unique or relevant waste-identifying datum. Thus, a category database can be developed which correlates a number of known waste identifiers with respective waste categories according to existing federal, state, local, institution-specific or other rules and regulations.</p>
  <p num="p-0224">In some embodiments, it may also be desirable to provide a database which lists ingredients of a plurality of known pharmaceuticals or other chemicals that have not yet been correlated to a waste category by the category database. Such an ingredient database can be used by the sorting algorithm in an intermediate step between identifying an item and assigning the item to a category on the basis of one or more ingredients. In some embodiments, an ingredient database may reside within the waste sorting and disposal system. In alternative embodiments, an ingredient database can reside at a remote location, such as on a server operated by a manufacturer of a particular item, or another remote location. The waste sorting and disposal system can be configured to access such remote databases via any available network, including the internet. In some embodiments, the remote or local databases may receive updates to maintain the sorting process current. In some embodiments, the updating occurs periodically based on a predetermined time interval (e.g., once every 24 hrs, week, month, etc.). In another embodiment, the updating occurs when a user prompts the system for an update. In yet another embodiment, the updating occurs when the system encounters a waste item for which no appropriate waste classification can be found.</p>
  <p num="p-0225">In some embodiments, on a first level, assignment of waste items to waste categories can be performed simply by sorting the items according to known characteristics. In some embodiments, a waste sorting algorithm simply involves locating a waste item identifier in a look-up table or database which lists known identifiers correlated to respective waste categories, such as the category database described above. Thus, to the extent that an item can be assigned to a waste category based solely on one or more waste item identifiers, the sorting algorithm can comprise a simple look-up routine. If needed, the sorting algorithm may also seek additional information such as from the ingredient database described above, or any other available source of additional information.</p>
  <p num="p-0226">Cases may arise where a single waste item possesses two or more waste identifiers (such as ingredients) belonging to two or more different waste categories. Thus, in the event that a particular waste item can reasonably be assigned to two or more waste categories, yet is only physically capable of being placed in a single container, the waste sorting algorithm can be configured to assign the item to a single category by reviewing a number of secondary variables. Such secondary variables may include a dosage or quantity of specific ingredients; a dilution or concentration level of one or more ingredients; a relative hazardousness level of one or more specific ingredients; a relative reactiveness of one or more ingredients; a shape, size, type or other feature of a waste item container (e.g., a pill bottle, syringe, etc); a physical property of the item (e.g., liquid, solid or gas), or any other datum that may be available to a user, but that might not be automatically determinable by the sorting station. If such a piece of additional information is needed in order to complete an assignment of an item to a container, the sorting station can prompt a user to input further information. Such additional information can be input by selecting from multiple answer choices or by typing.</p>
  <p num="p-0227"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is a flow chart illustrating one embodiment of a sorting algorithm. In the illustrated embodiment, a user initiates the process by presenting <b>300</b> a waste item to be identified by the sorting station. The sorting station then detects <b>302</b> a waste item identifier in any manner discussed above, such as scanning a barcode, reading an RFID tag, or scanning a textual or graphic label. The system then searches <b>304</b> the category database using any information or identifier determined from the item in an attempt to discover whether the determined identifier has previously been correlated to a waste category. If the identifier is found <b>306</b> to have been correlated to a waste category, the system continues by assigning the item to the appropriate waste category, and facilitating disposal of the item in the appropriate container.</p>
  <p num="p-0228">On the other hand, if the identifier is not found in the category database (e.g., if the system discovers that the determined waste item identifier is insufficient to determine an appropriate waste category), the system may search an ingredient database <b>308</b> for additional information or further details about the item. If additional information is found <b>320</b> in an ingredient database, the additional information, along with the originally-detected waste item identifier can be used to again search the category database <b>322</b>. If this information is found to be sufficient <b>324</b> to assign the item to a waste category, then the system assigns the item <b>326</b> to that category, determines an appropriate container <b>328</b> and facilitates disposal <b>330</b> of the item in a container associated with the assigned category. The system can also store <b>340</b> the identifier/category assignment combination in the category database for use in accelerating the sorting of future waste items with the same identifier.</p>
  <p num="p-0229">However, if the search of the ingredient database yields insufficient information to assign the item to a waste category, the system may seek additional information by prompting a user <b>342</b> to input additional information. Such a prompt may request specific information, such as a choice between known alternatives, or may be more general in nature. The information received <b>344</b> from the user can then be combined with previously-obtained information about the item, and the category database can again be searched in an attempt to assign the item to a category. If this information, in combination with the previously-obtained information, is sufficient to assign the item to a waste category <b>346</b>, then the system assigns the item <b>326</b> and facilitates disposal <b>330</b> of the item in the appropriate container. As above, the system can also store <b>340</b> the identifier/category assignment combination in the category database for use in accelerating the sorting of future waste items with the same identifier.</p>
  <p num="p-0230">If the information received <b>344</b> from the user is insufficient <b>346</b> for the system to make a category assignment, the system can either prompt the user for still more information <b>342</b>, or the system can simply assign <b>350</b> the item to the most conservative waste category for disposal of the item as hazardous waste.</p>
  <p num="p-0231"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a portion of a sorting algorithm which can be used in determining the best container for a particular item. Once the sorting algorithm has assigned an item to a waste category, the system determines <b>328</b> the container type associated with the assigned waste category. In the illustrated embodiment, the station searches the stock of the containers currently loaded into that station to determine whether the assigned container type is present in that particular sorting station <b>360</b>. If the container type is present, the station proceeds to indicate <b>362</b> the appropriate container to the user, and the user may then deposit <b>330</b> the item into the selected container. However, in some embodiments, if the selected container type is not present, the station can assess <b>366</b> whether another sorting station nearby contains a container of the assigned type. If a station with the selected container is nearby, the system can direct the user <b>370</b> to the nearby station to deposit the item. If a station with the selected container type is not nearby, the system can re-assign <b>368</b> the waste item to the most conservative (e.g., the highest level hazardous waste) category for which a container is loaded into the station.</p>
  <p num="p-0232">In an alternative embodiment, a station may indicate that the selected container is full and thus cannot accept any further waste items. In such a case, the station can instruct the user to replace the container with an empty one of the same type. Alternatively, the station can instruct the user to use a container in a nearby station. In some embodiments, the station may offer the user a choice between replacing a container and using a nearby station.</p>
  <p num="p-0233">The term “nearby” is a relative term, and can include any actual distance deemed appropriate by a particular user or system administrator. For example, in some embodiments, a station located on another floor of the hospital may be considered nearby, while in other embodiments, a sorting station across the hallway may not be considered nearby for the purposes of re-directing disposal of the waste item.</p>
  <p num="p-0234">In some embodiments it may be inappropriate or undesirable to re-assign an item to a higher level container in the event that an appropriate waste category cannot be determined (e.g., as in step <b>350</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>), or that an appropriate container cannot be located within an acceptable proximity (e.g., in step <b>368</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>). In such embodiments, it may be desirable to provide a temporary holding space for items that cannot be placed in any currently present container to the extent allowed by regulations governing satellite storage of hazardous waste. Such items can then be analyzed at a later time by a hazardous waste analyst in order to determine the most appropriate disposal of the item. Once such an analysis is performed, the analyst preferably enters such information into the category database in order to facilitate future sorting of items having similar characteristics.</p>
  <p num="p-0235">In some embodiments, the waste sorting software can be configured to maintain a log file of all identified waste items and the categories/container to which each item was assigned. Such information can be used by hospital administrators, regulatory auditors, pharmacists, or other entities to determine what items were disposed of and how. This information can be used to further optimize the sorting algorithm, to audit compliance with regulations, to audit usage or disposal of specific items, to alter a container arrangement in a station to increase sorting efficiency, or any of a variety of other purposes.</p>
  <p num="p-0236">By enlisting the use of one or more embodiments of the present system, hospitals can demonstrate to their communities and their staff that they are participating in the improvement of the environment. It has been demonstrated by the US Geological Survey that the groundwater in the United States is contaminated with drugs. Although in trace amounts, the cumulative effect of these contaminants have been shown to be endocrine system disrupters contributing to the rise in cancers, birth defects and other ailments. By properly sorting the spent drugs into appropriate containers, the waste can be properly processed in order to leave only an inert residue that cannot contaminate the ground water.</p>
  <p num="p-0237">Thus, embodiments of a medical waste sorting and disposal system advantageously provide a convenient means for clinicians to automatically sort pharmaceutical waste streams in order to comply with RCRA without the need to manually classify and sort each item individually. Additionally, the system advantageously provides hospitals with a means for participating in the improvement of the environment while avoiding fines for non-compliant waste disposal methods.</p>
  <p num="p-0238">Additionally, as described above, some embodiments of the system can be configured to create a manifest to provide administrators suitable tracking information on the amount of a drug that has been actually used. Many hospitals are now moving toward implementing drug dispensing automation. The automation provides the hospital pharmacist and administrator information on what drugs are dispensed but not a convenient way of generating information on how much of a drug is used.</p>
  <p num="h-0012">Medical Waste Treatment System</p>
  <p num="p-0239">In one embodiment, a medical waste treatment system is provided. The medical waste treatment system is a product that renders infectious waste non-infectious, compacts it to a fraction of the original volume and uniquely maintains the treated material in a compact form. The cost of present embodiments of a medical waste treatment system is much less than competing technologies, because the footprint of the equipment is, in one embodiment, about one fourth the size. Competing technologies have cycle times that are long (usually about one hour) which necessitate large vessels for acceptable throughput versus the medical waste treatment system which has a cycle time of less than five minutes.</p>
  <p num="p-0240">In one embodiment, the operating cost goal (about $0.09/lb) will be equal or better than most common technology, autoclave sterilization. Other competing technologies may have lower operating costs but they have many drawbacks. Incinerators may be one option, but it is possible that the EPA may tighten regulations and force many of the remaining incinerators to shut down. Many states do not allow incinerators to operate within their boundaries. For example, much of California's infectious waste is trucked to a Kansas City incinerator. The transportation costs add to the actual operating costs. Plasma technologies have equipment costs that are very high ($1-$3 million) and are, therefore, only suitable for central processing plants.</p>
  <p num="p-0241">In one embodiment, a medical waste treatment system as a truck mounted service to hospitals is provided. The medical waste treatment system has significant advantages over truck mounted chemical processors. The medical waste treatment system unlike the chemical processors has a residue that is substantially innocuous such as common sand. It has been demonstrated that if there are any concentrations of organic matter, such as blood, the chemicals tend to be consumed by the organics leaving some of the remaining waste in a load untreated or partially treated. In one embodiment, the medical waste treatment system uses a unique heat technology that quickly and uniformly decontaminates the waste regardless of the amount of organics present. In several embodiments, the heat technology comprises use of sand or wax (including, but not limited to, paraffin) or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the sand and/or wax is heated to a temperature of about 150° C. to about 250° C., preferably between about 165° C. to about 225° C. In one embodiment, the sand and/or wax is heated for less than about five minutes. One particular advantage of this method is the ability to produce highly stiff and/or compacted medical waste. In some embodiments, the volume and/or surface area of the treated medical waste is reduced to about 1/10 of its original size.</p>
  <p num="p-0242">In addition to truck mounted systems, stand alone versions of the system or a central off-site processing unit can be made available for hospital purchase. In this way, infectious waste can be treated efficiently.</p>
  <p num="p-0243">Up to about 50% of infectious medical waste can be plastic, of which about 25% can include disposable PVC waste. Utilizing sand or wax to treat such plastic waste may not be any more cost effective than an autoclave or other processing approach for these materials. It also may cause a number of problems such as the PVC outgassing chlorine because the temperature may be greater than 320° F. (the effective melting temperature of PVC).</p>
  <p num="p-0244">Thus, in one embodiment, a potential processing system for such plastic waste includes a rough grinder to grind the heterogeneous infectious medical waste into 2″ by 5″ strips. A second grinder grinds the waste into small pellets that are less than 0.25″ in diameter. The waste pellets are mixed with a whitening agent and moisture that in the presence of UVC and/or UVA will cause an oxidative reaction which in turn will denature protein or organics, thereby inactivating some if not all of the microorganisms or spores present in the pelletized waste. This will set up the microorganisms and spores for a shorter sterilization procedure.</p>
  <p num="p-0245">In some embodiments, the moisture can be removed by a dryer and then conveyed to a hopper of a plastic extruder. The extruder can be set to temperature less than 320 degrees F. but hot enough to melt the PVC. Plasticizers and other additives may be introduced to get the heterogeneous pelletized mix of waste to flow homogeneously and not clump or dissociate. This process is also the final sterilization procedure. Many of the states have adopted a document called the STAAT II (and soon STAAT III) sterilization guideline that spells out the amount of reduction of spores and microorganisms required for sterilization.</p>
  <p num="p-0246">In some embodiments, the effluent from this plastic-treating process could then be used as a filler for a product that is extruded into useful products rather than being placed in a landfill. Reducing disposal of solid waste is desirable because of the disposal cost (0.02 to 0.05 cents per pound). In one embodiment, the effluent can be used in the manufacture of fence posts and building materials. For example, the effluent may be used for a security fence that is composed of a hollow extrusion that forms posts and walls. Extruded hospital waste may provide such hollow extrusions with more weight and structural integrity than wood. In another embodiment, multiple compressed Mylar sheets may be applied to the exterior of the fence to provide additional benefits (e.g., rendering the wall bullet resistant or proof).</p>
  <p num="p-0247">Other embodiments are possible, for example freeway dividers, caskets, asphalt filler for roads or any proprietary design that incorporates previously extruded hollow profiles that are filled with the extruded sterilized infectious medical waste can be used.</p>
  <p num="h-0013">Medical Waste-Water Monitoring System</p>
  <p num="p-0248">In one embodiment, a medical waste water management system is provided. In one embodiment this system is a water quality sampling service that is supplied to hospitals, clinics and labs. The product would be installed at the P trap of a sink. The medical waste-water monitoring system would sense water draining and a sample of water would be directed to a cuvette on a carousel. The samples could be taken randomly or in some predetermined sequence at a number of different sinks throughout a facility. The carousel of cuvettes would be removed, and then sent to an inside or outside lab for analysis. The analysis would pinpoint the location of any water pollution. Training classes to reinforce the proper disposal of pharmaceuticals are provided according to one embodiment of the invention. The service would continue on a less frequent basis once clinician habits had improved.</p>
  <p num="p-0249">Despite a plethora of federal, state and local regulations, many clinicians continue to inappropriately dispose of pharmaceuticals in the sink. This is especially true of pharmaceutical spiked IV fluids. Verification of this practice has been established in a recent market research effort with 150 hospitals in which 60% of the respondents admitted to inappropriate disposal of drugs down the drain.</p>
  <p num="p-0250">One advantage of several embodiments of this system is that it can pinpoint the source of the infraction. By combining this service along with the other products and services owned by the assignee of the present application will provide valuable improvement and advantages.</p>
  <p num="h-0014">Air Quality Monitoring System</p>
  <p num="p-0251">The air quality monitoring system is a service that utilizes a device to sample the air quality, primarily in the pharmacy, oncology and operating room areas. It is intended to detect hazardous drugs including chemotherapeutics and anesthetics that become volatilized. The service is intended to provide clinicians with drug specific air quality information. The service will also suggest ways of eliminating the contaminants with both devices and a change in protocol. One advantage of some embodiments of this approach is that drug specific information that can be obtained.</p>
  <p num="h-0015">Hospital Hazard Prevention</p>
  <p num="p-0252">According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, hospitals and nursing facilities are among the most hazardous work environments. Each year, an average of seven occupational injuries or illnesses out of 100 employees occurs. About half result in lost work time. Working with or exposure to toxic chemicals is the single largest contributing risk factor associated with occupational injury and illness in healthcare</p>
  <p num="p-0253">Although nanoemulsion disinfectants and microfiber materials for cleaning and disinfection have worked successfully to reduce toxicity, much opportunity remains to improve the hospital environment, making it safer for the healthcare worker. Reducing hospital hazards will also result in savings to the hospital.</p>
  <p num="p-0254">In one embodiment, a system for a service to analyze and implement reductions in hospital hazards is provided. Implementing the solutions with hospital personnel will be a process similar to making cost reductions in organizations with significant numbers of administrative procedures.</p>
  <p num="h-0016">Handheld Devices</p>
  <p num="p-0255">In one embodiment, the waste sorting device comprises a computer, barcode scanner, memory, and wireless communication connected or coupled to an array of containers with automated opening means. In order to address anticipated cost concerns, less expensive means of sorting medical waste have been considered. One embodiment of a low-cost medical waste sorting system and method comprises the use a wireless handheld computer or similar wireless device having a barcode scanner. Such a wireless device can be used to scan waste items and determine the waste classification of the item being discarded. In one embodiment, the scanner communicates with an array of collection containers (either directly, via the system's control unit or via some other system component) using an infrared (IR) light beam (similar to that used by television or stereo remotes). The IR beam causes the correct container to open. This approach has the potential of redistributing hardware costs in a more favorable way. Thus, in one embodiment, the cost of the container array is reduced by implementing the IR receiver and container controls in dedicated electronics. Of course those of skill in the art will recognize that the handheld computer or device may communicate with the other components of the sorting system in various other hardwired and wireless ways, including, but not limited to, Ethernet, cable, radio frequency identification (RFID), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc. Likewise, in another embodiment, hardware costs may be reduced as the necessary portable devices are issued to personnel rather than being dedicated to particular room locations. For example, the handheld computer count can average 1 per nurse rather than 1 per room. Since there are generally many more rooms than nurses in a particular healthcare facility, significant cost savings (e.g., 3 to 5 fold per one embodiment of the invention) are envisioned for the computing, wireless communication and bar code scanning hardware.</p>
  <p num="p-0256">In another embodiment, costs are further reduced by displaying the waste item information on the screen of the handheld computer. The user can then place the item in the appropriate conventional waste container. Under such embodiments, where each nurse or other individual responsible for discarding waste must be equipped with his or her own handheld computer, the cost of the automated container array are avoided. Some embodiments also allow leveraging existing handheld computer hardware, if used, by placing Eco-Rex™ or other drug information software on a multi-purpose handheld computer, such as those used for barcode medication administration. A handheld device is particularly advantageous in certain embodiments because it permits the use of waste containers situated within, coupled to, or in communication with a wall unit. Wall units used in conjunction with handhelds may be more economical and cost-effective for certain healthcare institutions.</p>
  <p num="p-0257">In some embodiments, handheld devices may facilitate disposal of waste items by indicating to the user, via a display, the closest disposal location for that particular waste item. For example, in one embodiment, a user may use his or her handheld device to scan a medical waste item while in a patient's room. In one embodiment, the handheld device and the facility may be equipped with the appropriate wireless technology to enable the system to determine the current location of the user. Thus, the display on the handheld device may be configured to locate the closest suitable waste container capable of handling the particular waste item. In other embodiments, the system may use level sensing and/or container sensing means to direct the user to the appropriate waste container. The handheld system may be well-suited to track multiple features of drug administration and/or personnel. For example, if handheld units are associated with a specific individual, the institution may be able to monitor drug administration and disposal on an individual basis. Whether handheld or not, some embodiments of the present invention may be particularly useful for monitoring the percentage of hospital drugs that are properly disposed.</p>
  <p num="h-0017">Container Sensing</p>
  <p num="p-0258">One feature of some embodiments of the invention is the ability to automatically detect containers. Knowledge of whether or not a container is present allows the device to disable a bay that is not populated with a container. In another embodiment, each container is also provided with a machine-readable pattern that is applied to the container surface by a label or the like. One embodiment of different machine-readable patterns for containers is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0259">In one embodiment, when a bay is empty, the machine will know not to direct waste to that bay. However, when a bay is occupied, the device, using the information provided by the machine-readable pattern, will correctly identify the container and direct the waste accordingly.</p>
  <p num="p-0260">In another embodiment, containers can be “hot-swapped,” (e.g., changed from one bay to another during use, and the device will register the order or position of the containers and/or container positions. In one embodiment, the system instantly registers the container mix and/or container positions.</p>
  <p num="p-0261">In one embodiment in which the device is capable of identifying containers, usage information can be collected and used to implement a use-fee based payment schedule.</p>
  <p num="p-0262">In another embodiment, the usage information can be used to detect improper or unauthorized disposal of waste into the containers by comparing the accumulated machine usage data to corresponding data retained by the particular facility (e.g., sales figures). Another advantage of some embodiments involves the ability to track container change out, storage time, and usage information.</p>
  <p num="p-0263">In one embodiment, the containers are manufactured using common tooling techniques known in the art and injection moldings that are made with a single color (e.g., white). Container types may be distinguished for human recognition using color coded labels. In other embodiments, specialized tooling is used. In yet another embodiment, containers are manufactured with one or more special distinguishing characteristics, including color, size, shape, material, codes, etc.</p>
  <p num="p-0264">In one embodiment, labels are used in conjunction with the containers. Optionally, the labels may also contain the above mentioned machine-readable patterns to allow machine recognition.</p>
  <p num="p-0265">In one embodiment, the container labels (e.g., adhesive labels) may also include optional serialization that would permit tracking of the waste items placed into a specific container. Consequently, a container can later be identified by its serial number and tracked on a computer. Further, this information can optionally be used to print a manifest describing the contents of a given container. This is especially helpful since regulatory authorities often require a manifest to be placed on waste containers. Presently, these requirements are sometimes met by “over manifesting” (e.g., listing all possible types of waste that may be discarded in the container). However, as regulation of such waste becomes more stringent, this practice may be disallowed in the future. In addition, some embodiments of the invention use serialized containers that provide an elegant method of detailed container manifesting.</p>
  <p num="p-0266">In yet another embodiment, the number of times a particular reusable container has been used will be tracked. One advantage of such a tracking system is to aid users in determining when a reusable container is approaching the end of its life cycle. This is particularly useful for containers that may be reused for only a predetermined number of times.</p>
  <p num="h-0018">Manual Input System for Additional Waste Characteristics (e.g., not Empty/Empty, Sharp/not-Sharp)</p>
  <p num="p-0267">In some embodiments of the invention, the system determines one or more characteristics of the item that is to be sorted or disposed. In one embodiment, the system incorporates a manual input system that prompts the user to indicate information regarding certain waste item characteristics that may not be automatically detectable by the system. For example, in some embodiments, the system may query a user as to whether the waste item is empty or not-empty. This distinction can be important as waste items that are not empty (e.g., those that still contain a volume of bulk chemistry) pose a greater risk of groundwater contamination if landfilled. For example, drugs on the EPA P-list must be triple-rinsed before they are allowed into a public solid waste disposal facility. The user prompt may occur either prior to or following the scanning of the waste item for a determination of the National Drug Code (NDC) number. Further, the user may be prompted to provide this information in one of several ways. For example, the user may be queried using either a visual instruction or a voice command.</p>
  <p num="p-0268">In a further embodiment of the invention, the system interacts with the user to determine whether the item to be disposed contains a needle, and therefore, should be handled as bio-hazardous waste. For example, the system prompts the user, by one of several means, to indicate whether a sharps item is being disposed. In some embodiments, a visual instruction or voice command is used to prompt the user to indicate such information. In most hospitals, because a needle is assumed to have been in contact with the bodily fluids of a patient, it is treated as infectious. Such items are referred to as “bio-hazardous” by lab personnel and as “regulated medical waste” by waste haulers. Thus, a preliminary determination as to whether a particular waste item qualifies as a sharps determines whether the item needs to be handled as infectious. In one embodiment, if the waste item is an empty sharp, it would normally be directed to the “red sharps” waste stream. If the waste item is a non-empty sharp, then it must be handled according to the chemical risk, possibly ending up in a container with mixed medical and hazardous waste. Thus, disposal costs of the waste may be influenced by such preliminary qualifications. Proper handling may result in lowering of disposal costs, added safety for personnel, and an increased sensitivity for the environment.</p>
  <p num="h-0019">Waste Sorting Decision Matrix</p>
  <p num="p-0269">In one embodiment of the invention, the system for sorting waste comprises a computer equipped with one or more software applications and a database system that control the handling of each identified NDC. In one embodiment, the system could be enabled to identify the specific prompts and actions for each of the approximately 135,000 drugs in the NDC database. In an alternative embodiment, the actions are grouped into approximately two-dozen different handling procedures. In this embodiment, the database only needs to associate the NDC with a code representing the corresponding procedure. A separate database can then be used to define the details for prompts and actions associated with each waste group. This classification simplifies processing and database maintenance. One of skill in the art will understand that the number of handling procedure classes may vary in order to facilitate processing.</p>
  <p num="p-0270">In one embodiment, the sorting system comprises a computer that is programmed to operate as a state machine. A state machine is a concept originated by Turing and is sometimes called Finite State Automata or a Turing machine. A state machine remains in a known condition or state until a specific set of inputs causes a transition to a new state. For each state, a finite library of subsequent states is possible based on a finite library of input sets. In one embodiment, the computer has a state for each class of waste. Subsequent state transitions are invoked for various flags, as described below.</p>
  <p num="h-0020">2-Button Action File</p>
  <p num="p-0271">In some embodiments, the sorting system uses a manual input system in conjunction with a waste item identification device to further enhance the disposal of waste. For example, in one embodiment, the sorting system uses a 2-button action file to determine prompts and action steps for each type of item scanned. Questions are prompted sequentially, and thus, require the sustained attention of the user on the display and/or keypad to provide the necessary answers or to follow the necessary instructions. Under this approach, the system uses only two buttons, which may be incorporated into a low-cost textual display, such as an alphanumeric LCD having as few as one line of text. In addition, questions to the user can be worded for a yes/no answer. In a more elaborate embodiment, a graphical display may be used. The graphical display may even be color, such as a small computer monitor.</p>
  <p num="p-0272">In one embodiment, the keys can be 2 dedicated buttons or may be soft keys on a low cost text display. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> provides examples of a 2-button action file. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> <i>a </i>provides an example of a 2-button keyboard and display indicating a first prompt requiring a yes/no response. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> <i>b </i>provides an example of a 2-button keyboard and display indicating a second prompt requiring a yes/no response.</p>
  <p num="h-0021">4-Button Concept</p>
  <p num="p-0273">In one embodiment, the 2-button prompt concept is modified to simultaneously obtain information regarding more than one inquiry, thus avoiding “menu layering,” e.g., sequentially presenting menus. Various embodiments of the 4-button concept are feasible. For example, pairs of buttons serve to distinguish between “sharps” and “non-sharps” and “empty” and “not empty” in respective quadrants. Questions can be textual or graphical and can be color coded to enhance the user interface. In one embodiment, the buttons can be physical switch keys with permanent nomenclature (e.g., silk-screened). However, the buttons may also be represented by electrically activated annunciators or as touch screen zones of a high resolution display.</p>
  <p num="p-0274">In one embodiment, once familiar with using a particular machine, a user can go to the keypad as the item is being scanned and select from the four available selections without waiting for the prompt, thereby saving time.</p>
  <p num="h-0022">First 4-Button Graphics</p>
  <p num="p-0275"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> <i>a </i>illustrates one embodiment of a switch arrangement that utilizes four graphic images. Such a design can be used to simultaneously obtain key information from the user. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> <i>a</i>, the two left buttons are for sharps, while the two right buttons are for non-sharps. In addition, the two top buttons are for empty waste items, while the two bottom buttons are for non-empty waste items. Therefore, if the waste item is a sharps and is empty, the user should select the top, left button.</p>
  <p num="h-0023">4-Button Action File</p>
  <p num="p-0276">In one embodiment, a 4-button action file is used to determine prompts and action steps for each type of item scanned. Questions to the user are prompted simultaneously, and thus making it easier for the user to respond. The keys can be fixed or represented on a monochrome or a color graphics display. Moreover, keys can be implemented using 4 dedicated buttons or with 4 soft keys (e.g., on a low cost text display). Examples of a 4-button action file are provided in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>.</p>
  <p num="h-0024">Second 4-Button Graphics</p>
  <p num="p-0277">One of skill in the art will understand that several graphic designs can be used in accordance with several of the embodiments disclosed herein. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> <i>b </i>shows a second design for a switch arrangement using four graphic images specifically designed to obtain information related to whether a waste item is or is not a sharps and whether a waste item is or is not empty.</p>
  <p num="h-0025">Software Flags (Modes Of Operation)</p>
  <p num="p-0278">In some embodiments, the user (or another entity) can define configuration settings or “flags” for the device which change the entry point into the Action File and, in one embodiment, can increase the number of items in the Action File. Effectively, this permits a user to alter the system's mode of operation. For instance, if an embodiment includes the use of a cost/eco flag, there may be two lines in the Action File (e.g., one to handle waste as the most cost effective route and another to handle waste in the most ecologically conscious route). However, if the method of disposal were to be the same regardless of the setting of the flag, there may be only one item in the Action file. In an alternate embodiment, the Action File can have two items that are identical. Examples of several flags (or modes of operation) are described below.</p>
  <p num="h-0026">COST-ECO Flag</p>
  <p num="p-0279">In one embodiment, a “COST-ECO” flag is used. Implementing a COST-ECO flag may permit a hospital to specify a level of concern for waste disposal. If the hospital specifies the COST setting, the device operates in a manner that satisfies all regulatory and other legal requirements at the lowest cost. In practice, this can mean landfilling items with multiple toxic ingredients because they do not qualify as hazardous under Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Under RCRA regulations, medical waste is considered hazardous only if it contains an active ingredient on one of the EPA lists (e.g., P-list, U-list, or D-list).</p>
  <p num="p-0280">Alternatively, the ECO flag emphasizes greater concern for the environment and shows a willingness by the facility to spend more money for the potential environmental benefit. When the ECO flag is set, the device assigns multi-ingredient waste items, endocrine disruptors, estrogen mimics, and other high risk waste items into recommended waste streams that exceed the minimum regulatory and legal requirements.</p>
  <p num="h-0027">Waste Hauler Flag</p>
  <p num="p-0281">Certain waste haulers are licensed to handle bio-hazardous (regulated medical waste or RMW) waste, while others are licensed to handle toxic (hazardous) waste. In one embodiment, a flag may be used that allows sorting into different containers to accommodate the available waste haulers requirements. Thus, it may possible to prevent filling a container with a particular type of waste if the waste hauler cannot handle such waste.</p>
  <p num="h-0028">POTW (Publicly Owned Treatment Works) Flag</p>
  <p num="p-0282">Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) facilities may or may not be set up to handle and/or treat certain wastewater contaminants. Thus, in one embodiment, a POTW flag may be used. By adding a POTW flag to each item in the database, it is possible to identify whether a waste item can be directly discharged into a particular sewer system.</p>
  <p num="h-0029">Jump Drive and Barcode for Configuration</p>
  <p num="p-0283">In one embodiment, the sorting system will receive updates to the database to account for new drugs, repackaged drugs, admixtures, and the like. In one embodiment, the carts are not hardwired to an Ethernet connection port (CAT-5) and, thus, instead rely on a wireless communication to connect with the hospital's or facility's network (e.g., intranet). Since data security is a foremost concern in hospitals and other healthcare facilities, in one embodiment, new devices may be precluded from accessing the network until properly authenticated. In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>, one or more firewall systems are used to enhance a facility's data security networks. Typically, hospital devices conform to the Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP) standard. In order for a device to become LEAP authenticated, it typically needs to present certain keys. On a general-purpose computer, it is possible for the system administrator of a particular network to manually enter these keys (e.g., via keyboard and monitor). For those embodiments of the invention that are particularly cost-effective, less expensive, special-purpose, “headless” (no display or keyboard) devices can be used. Thus, alternative methods of supplying the necessary authentication codes are used.</p>
  <p num="p-0284">For example, in one embodiment, the authentication codes are inserted during the manufacturing process. However, this may not be possible if the customer is not known at the time of manufacture. Another method involves the temporary connection to a keyboard and display device in order to enter the codes. A third method uses a laptop computer connection for assigning codes. A fourth method is to temporarily dock the collection device to an Ethernet port and load the codes from another computer. These approaches, although usable in accordance with several embodiments of the invention, may require knowledge that is unavailable at a particular point in time, or may require unreasonable hardware intervention. A preferred method of loading the LEAP authentication codes is to insert a flash or thumb drive into a Universal Serial Bus (USB) port to download the codes. The USB drive could also be used for other computer setup tasks.</p>
  <p num="p-0285">In one of the several embodiments that use a barcode reader, the system employs authentication codes to a series of barcodes that may be presented to the scanner sequentially. Thus the device will read one or more barcodes and use the information to set up LEAP authentication. For those embodiments that do not use a bar code reader, other alternatives may be used (e.g., RFID, magnetic card, etc.).</p>
  <p num="h-0030">Repackaged Drugs and Admixture Sorting</p>
  <p num="p-0286">Several embodiments of the invention are adapted to receive waste from multiple sources. In one scenario, three main classes of pharmaceutical items are expected to reach the collection devices that are located in a point of care patient area. These can be described as (i) pass-through drugs; (ii) repackaged drugs; and (iii) admixtures.</p>
  <p num="p-0287">Pass-through drugs are drugs that reach the point of use in the original package as provided by the manufacturer. Examples include I.V. bags, syringes, inhalants, patches, and all single use items such as pills, liquids, creams, or others. According to one embodiment, once the item is used and presented to the sorting system, a barcode on the waste item can be easily read and decoded since the system's database should contain information on all of the roughly 135,000 known FDA registered drugs. Ideally, the barcode for these pass-through drugs will be (or may contain) the FDA registered NDC number.</p>
  <p num="p-0288">Repackaged drugs are those that are received from the manufacturer in a first package, and are transferred to a second package for distribution to the point of care patient area. The repackaging may take place in a pharmacy, another location within the hospital, or an off-site commercial repackaging house. Examples of commonly repackaged drugs include bulk packaged pills, powders, or liquids that usually must be repackaged into smaller portions or “unit dose” packages for distribution. Repackaging facilitates handling, billing, and verifying correct medication administration.</p>
  <p num="p-0289">The package for repackaged drugs can be bar-coded to be recognized by embodiments of the invention. Typically, it is the hospital's responsibility to design the barcode that accompanies repackaged goods. For example, the selected barcode may be the NDC number of the larger package. Although this “borrowed” barcode correctly identifies the drug's chemistry, it is not entirely correct, because it does not provide package code information as does a full NDC code. By changing the package and keeping the barcode, a portion of the barcode becomes technically incorrect. However, it is still usable by some embodiments of the sorting system and is one of the preferred barcodes for the second package of a repackaged drug.</p>
  <p num="p-0290">The hospital may also generate a site-unique barcode for the second package. In one embodiment, the site-unique barcode typically starts with an “L” or “99” to distinguish it from manufacturer NDC codes. In order for embodiments of the sorting system to dispose an item with a site-unique barcode, communication between the collection device and the pharmacy is preferred. In one embodiment, the pharmacy provides the collection device with an NDC code with which to associate the barcode appearing on the repackaged item. In one embodiment, the communication may occur in real-time, when the item is presented for disposal. However, real-time communication may slow the operation of the collection device, as the pharmacy computer may be busy or unacceptably slow due to authentication and encryption requirements or communication traffic. In one preferred embodiment, the necessary communication between the collection device and the pharmacy occurs before the item is discarded (e.g., by a broadcast message from the pharmacy at the time the order is filled and sent to the floor).</p>
  <p num="p-0291">Communications of this sort often take the form of a Health Level 7 (HL7) message. HL7 is an industry standard communication scheme for information transfer among diverse hospital systems such as billing, admissions, patient records, medication administration and the like. The HL7 formatted message will associate the NDC of the waste item contents with the barcode on the package. In one preferred embodiment, the HL7 message directed to the sorting system will safeguard patient-specific information in compliance with all privacy requirements, such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act).</p>
  <p num="p-0292">In addition to pass-through and repackaged drugs, pharmacies often create custom recipes containing multiple pharmaceutical ingredients. These “7 admixtures” are generally labeled with a site-specific barcode rather than the NDC code of their ingredients. In one embodiment, the site-unique barcode is decoded. In one preferred embodiment, the sorting system is instructed to sort the admixture waste via an HL7 message or the like. Unlike a single repackaged item, an admixture message will associate the barcode with multiple NDC numbers contained in the admixture being discarded. In one embodiment, once the sorting system is in possession of the list of NDC numbers, it can quickly identify the container in which the waste item should be placed, Such a determination is based on individual waste stream codes for the various constituent ingredients in the waste item. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> illustrates a flowchart of one embodiment of the decision logic related to the identification and classification of the waste items.</p>
  <p num="p-0293">One of skill in the art will appreciate that the flowchart in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> shows one example of how the waste sorting system can handle admixture waste in real-time.</p>
  <p num="h-0031">On Screen Waste Stream Display</p>
  <p num="p-0294">In one embodiment, a display is provided to indicate selected information, including, but is not limited to, the NDC decoded from the barcode on the package, the chemistry formulation derived from the database lookup (which would match that listed on the package), the waste composition and categorization determined by the machine (which should match the open door), and/or the reasons for the particular waste decision.</p>
  <p num="h-0032">Restricted Access Containers</p>
  <p num="p-0295">In one embodiment of the invention, the present invention comprises waste receptacles that are adapted to restrict access to medical or pharmaceutical waste, once that waste has been deposited in the receptacle.</p>
  <p num="p-0296">In one embodiment, a receptacle for medical or pharmaceutical waste is provided. In one embodiment, the container is adapted to restrict access to disposed waste. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 44</figref> illustrate some of the features of some of the embodiments discussed below. In one embodiment, the container comprises a lid <b>82</b> formed in a V-shaped cross section, with circular outer edges. In a further embodiment, a shield <b>26</b> having a circular cross section, wherein the shield is positioned at the perimeter of the arc formed by said lid <b>82</b> is also provided. In yet another embodiment, a latch assembly <b>24</b> is provided. In one embodiment, the container comprises a V-shaped lid, one or more shields, and one or more latch assemblies.</p>
  <p num="p-0297">In another embodiment, a restricted access container for medical or pharmaceutical waste is provided wherein the container comprises a lid having substantially circular outer edges, wherein the lid is rotatably operated so that the circular outer edges remain at a constant radius from the axis in all positions, a blocking means adapted to block access to waste contents in all lid positions, and a latch assembly.</p>
  <p num="p-0298">In one embodiment, the lid is adapted to restrict, exclude, reduce, or minimize access to deposited waste when in the closed position. In a preferred embodiment, the lid is further adapted to restrict, exclude, reduce, or minimize access to deposited waste during the opening cycle. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the waste receptacle has a safety feature that restricts (or minimizes) access to disposed medical or pharmaceutical waste while the receptacle is being opened. Thus, in one embodiment the container permits disposal of additional waste while simultaneously restricting access to waste that has been previously disposed.</p>
  <p num="p-0299">Some embodiments of the present invention can also be used for receptacles containing materials other than medical or pharmaceutical waste. Thus, in some embodiments, the restricted access lid can be used with non-medical, non-pharmaceutical containers, holders, or vessels.</p>
  <p num="p-0300">In one embodiment, a rotary level sensor operates in conjunction with a rotary lid. One function of the lid, according to several embodiments of the invention, is to open upon command from the electronics, allowing an item of hazardous waste to be deposited.</p>
  <p num="p-0301">A second function of the lid, according to several embodiments of the invention, is that the open lid is easily recognizable by the user, from among an array of other container lids, intuitively directing their attention to the open container, thus avoiding the need for lights or other indicating means.</p>
  <p num="p-0302">A third function of the lid, according to several embodiments of the invention, is to exclude access to the container contents by the user or other personnel, at all times. The lid, according to some embodiments, may be adapted to accomplish none, one, two, or all three of these functions.</p>
  <p num="p-0303">In one embodiment, the restricted access safety feature comprises a lid formed in a V-shaped cross section, with circular outer edges. The lid is rotatably operated so that the circular outer edges remain at a constant radius from the axis in all positions, including open, closed, and in between open and closed. The V-shaped lid forms an approximately 135 degrees angle, and its diameter is such that the resulting opening is large enough to accept the largest anticipated waste item. In one embodiment, the lid motion is also limited to approximately 135 degrees. One of skill in the art will understand that lids of other shapes and other angles can also be used in accordance with several embodiments of the present invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0304">In one embodiment, a shielding means, or shield, is also provided. For example, in one embodiment, a shield that is circular in cross section is placed at the perimeter of the arc described by the lid during a portion of its motion. In one embodiment, the lid, in combination with the shield, blocks access to the contents during some or most operating positions. In a preferred embodiment, the lid, in combination with the shield, blocks access to the contents during all operating positions.</p>
  <p num="p-0305">In one embodiment, a latch assembly is provided. In one embodiment, a latch assembly is part of the equipment and mates to a container during use. In a preferred embodiment, the container is formed with control rods extending outward from one end to mate with openings in the latch assembly. One control rod is tied to the lid, and the other is tied to the bar. Rotational position information of the lid and bar is transferred to concentric inner and outer rings, which track the rotational motion of the lid and bar. The inner and outer ring are each supplied with a position indicator and opto-interruptor for detecting a predetermined position. In a preferred embodiment, the lid detector is set to indicate when the lid is closed, and the bar detector is set to detect when the bar is fully open. In one embodiment, each ring is supplied with a torsion spring to provide opening force.</p>
