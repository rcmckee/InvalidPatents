    <heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading> <p num="p-0002">This application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-073182, filed Mar. 19, 2008.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="p-0004">The present invention relates to an on-vehicle camera lens glass material used for an optical device such as an imaging lens mounted in an on-vehicle camera and to the on-vehicle camera lens.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">2. Description of Related Art</p>
    <p num="p-0006">Conventionally, in order to eliminate driver's blind spots while driving a vehicle, there has been proposed a method of installing an on-vehicle camera on a vehicle. Specifically, by installing a camera for imaging the rear and the side of a vehicle on the vehicle itself, an image taken by the camera is displayed on a position where a driver can check the image by his/her own eyes. Therefore, it is possible to eliminate the blind spots.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">In view of a low price and light weight, an optical device made of plastic material or low refractive glass material is broadly used for an optical device such as an imaging lens mounted on the on-vehicle camera, as described in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. JP-A-2006-11093.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">By comparison between the materials in an optical performance of lens material, the glass material is more excellent than plastic material in various properties. Accordingly, in the imaging lens constituted of a plurality of lenses, it has been studied that a plastic lens and a glass lens are used jointly in order to decrease manufacturing costs and improve optical performance.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">In such an on-vehicle camera, it is required to increase resolution and an imaging view angle of the camera in order to secure safety and improve recordability. However, it is difficult to configure an imaging lens suitable for the requirement by the plastic lens and the low refractive glass lens. Hence, in the imaging lens mounted in the on-vehicle camera, the configuration using high refractive optical glass can be considered.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">In such an imaging lens mounted in the on-vehicle camera, unlike an imaging lens of general camera, there is a possibility that the lens is damaged or eroded by shock, wind pressure, and dust while vehicle is running. In addition, there is also concern about lens surface deterioration and metamorphosis that is caused by acid rain and chemicals such as a cleanser and a wax used at the time of car washing. Further, when oil, dust, and coarse particulates are attached on a surface of the imaging lens, sometimes the lens surface may be blurred as time elapses, and when a contamination is in contact with the lens surface for a long time, sometimes the lens surface may metamorphose.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">In addition, when the camera is mounted on the front side of a vehicle body, there is concern about lens deterioration caused by heat generated from an engine and by nitrous oxide contained in gas exhausted from other vehicles which are running ahead of the vehicle. Further, the lens is frequently exposed under a severe environment where, for example, direct sun light including ultraviolet rays is irradiated on the lens for a long time. Particularly, when the lens has a wide-view angle, a first surface of the imaging lens has a larger exposed area. Therefore, the environment effect on the lens increases.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">Accordingly, when the imaging lens mounted in the on-vehicle camera is made of plastic material or optical glass material used in a general imaging lens, there is concern that enough durability is not secured. The reason is that plastic material and glass material, which has low glass transition temperature suitable for a precision press forming process that enables mass production of an aspheric surface lens, have low hardness and are easily scratched. In addition, plastic material has lower ultraviolet resistance than glass material, and is easily deteriorated when ultraviolet rays are irradiated thereon for a long time.</p>
    <p num="p-0013">In this case, it can be considered that a protective member made of an excellent glass material in chemical durability is disposed at the front of the imaging lens in order to prevent the lens from being directly exposed to outside environment such as wind or rain. However, when the protective member is installed, there is concern that the imaging view angle of the lens is restricted, and it becomes difficult to sufficiently enlarge the imaging view angle.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0014">Accordingly, the invention has been made in consideration of the situation mentioned above, and its object is to provide an on-vehicle camera lens glass material that is excellent in resistance of acid rain and chemicals, has a hardness enough to keep from scratching, is less deteriorated in characteristics by ultraviolet rays, has high refractive index, and is suitable to constitute an optical device such as an imaging lens mounted in an on-vehicle camera exposed to severe environment, and to provide an on-vehicle camera lens made of the on-vehicle camera lens glass material.</p>

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p num="p-0081">Hereinafter, a preferred embodiment of an on-vehicle camera lens glass material according to the invention will be described with reference to the drawings.</p>
    <p num="p-0082"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a sectional view illustrating a structure of an on-vehicle camera.</p>
    <p num="p-0083">The on-vehicle camera lens glass material according to the invention is a glass for forming the on-vehicle camera lens. The on-vehicle camera is a camera that is mounted on an outer side of a vehicle itself, and includes an on-vehicle camera lens (an imaging lens) <b>1</b> and an imaging element (CCD) <b>2</b> for taking an image formed by the on-vehicle camera lens <b>1</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In addition, the on-vehicle camera is disposed on the rear of the vehicle and is used for checking the rear, or is disposed on the front of the vehicle and is used for checking the front, the side, or a distance from a car ahead.</p>
    <p num="p-0084">The on-vehicle camera lens <b>1</b> is formed of plural sheets of lenses, light exiting from a subject is incident through a first lens <b>1</b> <i>a </i>close to an object point (the subject). The light sequentially passes the second and following lenses, and is formed as an image of the subject on an imaging surface.</p>
    <p num="p-0085">An on-vehicle camera lens glass material forming the on-vehicle camera lens is frequently exposed to rain, particularly, acid rain, and thus chemical durability (acid resistance) is required for at least the first lens <b>1</b> <i>a</i>. The acid rain is caused by a plurality of contaminations existing in the atmosphere. The on-vehicle camera lens glass material according to the invention has a sufficient chemical durability. Chemical durability of the on-vehicle camera lens glass material can be evaluated by a diluted nitric acid, and influence caused by acid rain also can be evaluated.</p>
    <p num="p-0086">Specifically, in the on-vehicle camera lens glass material according to the invention, a measurement result in acid resistance based on a powder method prescribed by Japanese Optical Glass Industrial Standard (1999 edition) is 1<sup>st </sup>Class or 2<sup>nd </sup>Class. The reason is that, in the chemical durability (the powder method) of an optical glass based on the standard, when the acid resistance is 3<sup>rd </sup>Class or more, the glass is blurred by erosion of acid rain, and a clear image can not be taken. In addition, the acid resistance is preferably 1<sup>st </sup>Class and a weight reduction ratio is preferably less than 0.1%.</p>
    <p num="p-0087">Japanese Optical Glass Industrial Standard (JOGIS) is a standard for a method of measuring an optical glass characteristics prescribed by Japanese Optical Glass Industrial Association. The measurement of the chemical durability (the acid resistance) based on the powder method prescribed by Japanese Optical Glass Industrial Standard (1999 edition) proceeds in the following order. First, samples are adjusted as follows.</p>
    <p num="p-0088">(1) A glass having new fracture surface is powdered in a mortar, the powder filtered through a sub wire sieve of 710 μm is filtered again through a standard wire sieve of 600 μm, and then the powder remaining in 425 μm is extracted. In addition, as the sieves, standard sieves specified by JIS Z 8801 (standard) are used.</p>
    <p num="p-0089">(2) An amount of the powder three times as much as specific gravity gram of glass is put in a 50 ml beaker, and 15 ml of a 99.5 vol % methanol is added. Then fine glass particulates are removed by means of decantation method.</p>
    <p num="p-0090">(3) After this cleaning process is repeated five times, the sample is dried in an air bath of 120 to 130° C. for 60 minutes, and is stored in a silica gel desiccator.</p>
    <p num="p-0091">Next, measurement of acid resistance proceeds in the following order.</p>
    <p num="p-0092">(1) a sample as much as specific gravity gram of glass is extracted by a dissolution basket, is shaken slightly, is put in a capped weighing bottle, and then the sample is precisely weighed. The dissolution basket includes a standard sieve of 177 to 210 μm that is made of platinum and a structure and a size thereof is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0093">(2) 80 ml of a 10 m mol/l {0.01N} nitric acid aqueous solution is put in a cleaned and dried round bottom flask, cooling pipes are fixed on the flask, and the flask is kept in a heating device for 10 minutes. As the nitric acid, a special grade nitric acid specified by JIS K 8541 (nitric acid (reagent)) is used. As the heating device, a boiling water bath having a depth capable of completely containing a rounded part of the round bottom flask is used. Water temperature of the water bath must be kept at 99° C. or more at a horizontal position higher by 20±10 mm than the bottom of the round bottom flask.</p>
    <p num="p-0094">(3) The dissolution basket in which the sample is put is carefully inserted in the round bottom flask, is processed in the heating device for 60 minutes, and then the basket is taken out.</p>
    <p num="p-0095">(4) About 80 ml of the 99.5 vol % methanol is put in a 100 ml beaker, and the basket is dipped therein to be cleaned.</p>
    <p num="p-0096">(5) After the step (4) is repeated three times, the sample is put in the weighing bottle, and is dried in the air bath of 120 to 130° C. for 60 minutes.</p>

The total content of SiO<sub>2 </sub>and ZrO<sub>2 </sub>is more preferably 15% by weight or more, and further preferably 20% by weight or more. The SiO<sub>2 </sub>is a base component of glass, and is a main component that determines the chemical durability. The ZrO<sub>2 </sub>is a component that increases the refractive index and simultaneously improves the chemical durability. The total content of SiO<sub>2</sub>+ZrO<sub>2 </sub>is set in the range mentioned above, and thus it is possible to improve chemical durability and obtain high refractive index.</p>

    <p num="p-0172">In addition, the on-vehicle camera lens glass material according to the invention may include a transparent crystallized glass. The transparent crystallized glass is obtained, for example, by a heat treatment for melting a glass material based on SiO<sub>2</sub>—Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>—Li<sub>2</sub>O based composition containing a crystal nucleating agent. In addition, as the transparent crystallized glass, there has been known a low expansion transparent crystallized glass based on Li<sub>2</sub>O—Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>—SiO<sub>2 </sub>based. In the crystallized glasses, a transparent glass can be formed in accordance with a composition or a heat treatment condition, most of them is configured to have as a main crystal a β-quartz solid solution crystal containing TiO<sub>2 </sub>of about 1.5% to 5% as a crystallizing agent.</p>
    <p num="p-0173">In addition, the B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is also a base component of glass and simultaneously is an effective component that improves meltability. When the B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is less than 0.1% by weight, the effect thereof is not sufficient. Conversely, when the B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is more than 25% by weight, the chemical durability of glass is intended to deteriorate. Accordingly, the content of the B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is preferably in the range of 0.1 to 25% by weight, and more preferably in the range of 0.1 to 20% by weight.</p>
    <p num="p-0174">The ZrO<sub>2 </sub>is a component that increases a refractive index and improves chemical durability.

    <p num="p-0185">In addition, the on-vehicle camera needs wide eyesight, and thus it is preferred that the on-vehicle camera lens glass material according to the invention have high refractive index. When a refractive index (nd) of the material with respect to line d is less than 1.70, it is difficult to configure a lens having small size and wide view angle. Accordingly, in the on-vehicle camera lens glass material, a refractive index with respect to line d is preferably 1.70 or more, more preferably 1.75 or more, and further preferably 1.80 or more.</p>

    <p num="p-0187">The on-vehicle camera lens glass material according to the invention can be manufactured by a general optical glass manufacturing process.</p>
    <p num="p-0188">For example, the on-vehicle camera lens glass material is manufactured by processes of:</p>
    <p num="p-0189">forming a mixed raw material by precisely weighing and mixing the glass raw materials, which properly employs an oxide, a hydroxide, a carbonate, a nitrate, a chloride, a sulfide, and the like, to obtain a desired composition;</p>
    <p num="p-0190">vitrifying the mixed raw material by heating;</p>
    <p num="p-0191">heating the molten glass in a heat-resistant container of which a content of platinum is 95% by weight or more;</p>
    <p num="p-0192">homogenizing the molten glass by stirring it with a rod having vanes, the rod having a content of platinum on the surface thereof is 95% by weight or more;</p>
    <p num="p-0193">clarifying the molten glass by defoaming it.</p>
    <p num="p-0194">The molten glass homogenized by the method mentioned above is formed by poring it to a mold to be molded, and then is cooled down up to room temperature in a furnace heated up to near the annealing point of glass.</p>
    <p num="p-0195">A glass piece is cut from block shaped glasses obtained by the method mentioned above, and the glass piece is grinded and polished. Therefore, it is possible to manufacture optical devices such as a lens and a prism. Alternatively, a glass piece is cut from the block shaped glasses, and is processed into a press molding material. Then, the material is heated to be soften, and is press-molded in a shape similar to an optical device by using a press molding tool. Subsequently, the press-molded product is grinded and polished, and thus it is possible to manufacture an optical device such as a lens or a prism.</p>
    <p num="p-0196">In any methods mentioned above, the glass polishing process is inserted. In this connection, the on-vehicle camera lens glass material according to the invention has high Knoop hardness. Thus, the material is easy to be finished with a smooth lens surface and with high accuracy in shape. In addition, since an average linear expansion coefficient thereof is low, it is easy to prevent glass from being damaged in the grinding or the polishing process. In addition, the on-vehicle camera lens glass material has excellent acid resistance and water resistance. Therefore, it may be possible to prevent so-called “blue tarnish” and “white tarnish” phenomenon caused after polishing and cleaning process. As described above, the on-vehicle camera lens glass material according to the invention has many advantageous characteristics in using and manufacturing an optical device.</p>
    <p num="p-0197">The on-vehicle camera lens glass material according to the invention has the advantageous characteristics mentioned above, and thus is appropriate for a material forming the on-vehicle camera lens. When the on-vehicle camera lens is formed of a plurality of lenses, it is preferred that a first lens <b>1</b> <i>a </i>close to a subject (an object point) be made of the on-vehicle camera lens glass material according to the invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0198">Specifically, in the on-vehicle camera lens according to the invention, at least a first lens <b>1</b> <i>a </i>close to a subject (an object point) is made of the on-vehicle camera lens glass material according to the invention mentioned above.

    <p num="p-0199">In addition, in the on-vehicle camera lens, it is preferred that a photocatalytic film be formed on at least a first surface, which is close to the object point, of the first lens <b>1</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0200">The photocatalytic film is a surface layer that is formed of photocatalytic particulates only or photocatalytic particulates and the like on the lens surface. Since the film has a hydrophilizing (a super hydrophilizing) function, water drops adhering to the surface are instantly spread on the whole surface, and thus has an effect of preventing the surface pollution caused by dust.</p>
    <p num="p-0201">As the photocatalytic particulates, it is preferred to use a crystalline titanium oxide such as an anatase type or a rutile type. Optionally, a metallic oxide such as ZnO, SnO<sub>2</sub>, SrTiO<sub>3</sub>, WO<sub>3</sub>, Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, or Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>may be used as the photocatalytic particulates. In addition, the surface layer may include silica or silicon other than the photocatalytic particulates.</p>
    <p num="p-0202">Exemplary methods of forming a hydrophilic surface layer containing photocatalytic particulates, in a case of a titanium oxide (titania), include methods of:</p>
    <p num="p-0203">forming an amorphous titania,</p>
    <p num="p-0204">coating a silica-blended titania,</p>
    <p num="p-0205">coating a tin oxide-blended titania, and</p>

    <p num="p-0207">In the method of forming the amorphous titania, firstly a target surface is coated with the amorphous titania, and the amorphous titania is phase-changed into a crystalline titania by a baking process, and it is possible to employ any one of the following methods.</p>
    <p num="p-0208">(1) Hydrolysis and Dehydration Condensation Polymerization of Organic Titanium Compound</p>
    <p num="p-0209">A hydrolysis depressant such as hydrochloric acid or ethylamine is added to an alkoxide of titanium such as a tetraethoxy titanium, a tetraisopropoxy titanium, a tetra n-propoxy titanium, a tetrabutoxy titanium, and a tetramethoxy titanium. Then, the sample is diluted with an alcohol such as an ethanol or a propanol, and hydrolysis is partially or completely performed thereon. Then, the mixture is coated, and is dehydrated at 200° C. from room temperature. Due to the dehydration, the hydrolysis of alkoxide of titanium is completed. Thus, a titanium hydroxide is produced, and an amorphous titania layer is formed by dehydration condensation polymerization of the titanium hydroxide. The alkoxide of titanium may be replaced with other organic titanium compound such as a chelate of titanium or an acetate of titanium.</p>
    <p num="p-0210">(2) Formation of Amorphous Titania by using Inorganic Titanium Compound</p>
    <p num="p-0211">An inorganic titanium compound such as an acid aqueous solution of a TiC<sub>14 </sub>or a Ti(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>is coated and is dehydrated at temperature in the range of 100 to 200° C., thereby performing hydrolysis and dehydration condensation polymerization and forming an amorphous titania layer. Alternatively, the amorphous titania layer may be formed on a surface to be coated, by chemical vapor deposition of the TiC<sub>14</sub>.</p>
    <p num="p-0212">(3) The amorphous titania layer is formed on the surface to be coated, by irradiating electron beams on a titanium target in oxidative atmosphere. The titanium target is formed as an amorphous titania by a sputtering process.</p>
    <p num="p-0213">Coating a silica-blended titania is that a layer made of a mixture of titania and silica is formed on the surface to be coated. A ratio of the silica to the total amount of titania and silica is in the range of 5 mol % to 90 mol %, preferably in the range of 10 mol % to 70 mol %, and more preferably in the range of 10 mol % to 50 mol %.</p>
    <p num="p-0214">In addition, as a method of forming a surface layer made of the silica-blended titania, it is possible to employ following methods.</p>
    <p num="p-0215">(1) A suspension liquid including silica particulates and titania particulates of the anatase type or the rutile type is coated on the surface of the substrate (the subject to be coated), and the coated substrate is baked at a temperature of softening point or less of the substrate.</p>
    <p num="p-0216">(2) A mixture of an amorphous silica precursor (for example, a tetraalkoxysilane such as a tetraethoxy titanium, a tetraisopropoxy titanium, a tetra n-propoxy titanium, a tetrabutoxy titanium, or a tetramethoxy titanium) and a crystalline titania sol is coated on the surface of the substrate. Then, a silanol is formed by performing the hydrolysis thereon as occasion demands, and the dehydration condensation polymerization is performed on the silanol by heating at about 100° C. or more. Thus, the surface layer (photocatalytic coating) in which the titania is conjugated to the amorphous silica is obtained. Particularly, when the dehydration condensation polymerization of the silanol is performed at 200° C. or more, it is possible to increase polymerization degree of the silanol and improve an alkali resistance property of the photocatalytic coating.</p>
    <p num="p-0217">(3) A suspension liquid formed by diffusing the silica particulates in a solution of an amorphous titania precursor (an organic titanium compound such as an alkoxide, a chelate, or an acetate of titanium, or an inorganic titanium compound such as a TiC<sub>14 </sub>or a Ti(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) is coated on the surface of the substrate. Then the hydrolysis and the dehydration condensation polymerization are performed on the titanium compound at a temperature of 200° C. from room temperature. Therefore an amorphous titania thin film in which the silica particulates are diffused is formed. Subsequently, the amorphous titania is heated in the range of titania crystallization temperature or more and the substrate softening point or less, and thus is phase-changed into the crystalline titania.</p>
    <p num="p-0218">(4) The amorphous silica precursor (for example, a tetraalkoxysilane such as a tetraethoxy titanium, a tetraisopropoxy titanium, a tetra n-propoxy titanium, a tetrabutoxy titanium, or a tetramethoxy titanium; a silanol which is a hydrolysate of those; or a polysiloxane of which average molecular weight is 3000 or less) is mixed with a solution of the amorphous titania precursor (an organic titanium compound such as an alkoxide, a chelate, or an acetate of titanium, or an inorganic titanium compound such as a TiC<sub>14 </sub>or a Ti(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>), and the mixture is coated on the surface of the substrate. Then, by performing the hydrolysis and the dehydration condensation polymerization on these precursors, a thin film made of the mixture of the amorphous titania and amorphous silica. Subsequently, the amorphous titania is heated in the range of titania crystallization temperature or more and the substrate softening point or less, and thus is phase-changed into the crystalline titania.</p>
    <p num="p-0219">Coating a tin oxide-blended titania is that a layer made of a mixture of titania and tin oxide is formed on the surface to be coated. A ratio of the tin oxide to the total amount of titania and tin oxide is in the range of 1 mol % to 95 mol %, and preferably in the range of 1 mol % to 50 mol %.</p>
    <p num="p-0220">In addition, as a method of forming a surface layer made of the tin oxide-blended titania, it is possible to employ following methods.</p>
    <p num="p-0221">(1) Anatase Type or Rutile Type Titania Particulates and Oxidation</p>
    <p num="p-0222">A suspension liquid including tin particulates is coated on the surface of the substrate (the subject to be coated), and the coated substrate is baked at a temperature of softening point or less of the substrate.</p>
    <p num="p-0223">(2) A suspension liquid formed by diffusing the tin oxide particulates in a solution of an amorphous titania precursor (an organic titanium compound such as an alkoxide, a chelate, or an acetate of titanium, or an inorganic titanium compound such as a TiC<sub>14 </sub>or a Ti(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) is coated on the surface of the substrate. Then the hydrolysis and the dehydration condensation polymerization are performed on the titanium compound at a temperature of 200° C. from room temperature. Therefore an amorphous titania thin film in which the tin oxide particulates are diffused is formed. Subsequently, the amorphous titania is heated in the range of titania crystallization temperature or more and the substrate softening point or less, and thus the amorphous titania is phase-shifted into the crystalline titania.</p>
    <p num="p-0224">In a method of coating a titania-contained silicone coating material, there is used a coating material in which the titania (photocatalytic particulates) is diffused in film forming components made of the silicone precursor or a non-cured or partial-cured silicone (organopolysiloxane). In detail, the coating material is coated on the surface of the substrate, the film forming components are cured, and then the photocatalyst is photoexcited. In this case, an organic group combined with a silicon atom of a silicon molecule is replaced with a hydroxyl group by action of the photocatalyst, and a contact angle of the surface to the water approaches 0°. As a result, the surface is hydrophilized (a super-hydrophilizing). According to this method, it is possible to cure the film forming components in a comparative low temperature, it is possible to coat the film forming components again and again whenever necessary, and it is also possible to easily hydrophilize glass even in sun light.</p>
    <p num="p-0225">In addition, in the on-vehicle camera lens, it is preferred that a hard coat film is formed on at least the first surface, which is close to the object point, of the first lens <b>1</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0226">The hard coat film, which is excellent in light resistance, antiweatherability, transparency, scratch resistance, surface hardness, abrasion resistance, heat resistance, and the like, is formed on a glass surface. In addition, the film is used as an optical thin film such as anti-reflective film, permselective film, ultraviolet shielding film, or the like. Such a hard coat film is formed by, for example, coating composition including: ultrafine particles of an composite oxide constituted of fine core particles, which are ultrafine particles of the rutile type titanium oxide, and cover layers, which include at least one kind of metal oxide, a sol thereof, or a curable binder component; and water or organic solvent. In addition, as the coating composition, it is possible to use a composition in which an alkoxysilane hydrolysate and Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>fine particles are stably diffused by an anionic based surfactant in a colloidal state. In addition, in the coating composition, to improve coatability and exterior appearance ability as occasion demands, there may be added a very small amount of ultraviolet absorbing agent (which is based on a benzotriazole based, a benzophenone based, or the like), an antioxidant, a disperse dye (water dispersion), an antistatic agent, and a surfactant (a non-ionic surfactant constituted of a hydrophobic group of dimethylsilicone oil and a hydrophilic group of polyester, or the like).</p>
    <p num="p-0227">As a method of coating a glass having the hard coat film composition, it is possible to use a brush coating, a dip coating, a roller coating, a spray coating, a spin coating, or the like, after the glass is previously processed by an acid cleaning, an alkali cleaning, a defatting cleaning using a solvent, a plasma treatment, or an ultrasonic cleaning. A dry curing condition is, for example, in the range of 80° C. to 150° C., and preferably in the range of 100° C. to 120° C., for about 1 hour to 5 hours. In addition, a thickness of the cured hard coat film is appropriately selectable in the range of 0.5 μm to 20 μm.</p>
    <p num="p-0228">In addition, between the glass and the hard coat film, it is preferred to provide a primer film. The primer film has a function of improving impact resistance and adhesiveness. In detail, in the primer composition, all or a main body of a film-forming resin is made of a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) or an ester based thermoplastic elastomer (TPEE). Examples thereof include a TPU base primer composition and a TPEE base primer composition configured so that the fine particles of the niobium oxide are diffused in the colloidal state.</p>
    <p num="p-0229">In addition, in the on-vehicle camera lens, the hard coat film is formed and preferably the photocatalytic film is further formed on the first surface, which is close to the object point, of the first lens <b>1</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0230">However, in the on-vehicle camera lens, at least one surface of the plurality of lenses is formed as an aspheric surface. Therefore, it is possible to achieve improvements in characteristics such as a decrease in aberration, an increase in resolution, and the like.</p>

    <p num="p-0234">Using raw materials having purity of an optical glass, the raw materials such as an oxide, a hydroxide, a carbonate, a nitrate, a chloride, and a sulfate were precisely weighed so as to make the composition shown in Table 1. Then, the mixed raw material was put in a platinum melting pot, and was melted by being heated up to 1300° C. to 1500° C. Subsequently, the material was homogenized by being stirred with a stirring rod having a platinum vanes, was clarified by standing it, and the melted material was made to flow in a mold. The glass was solidified, and was moved to an electric furnace previously heated up to near an annealing point of the glass, and was gradually cooled down to room temperature.</p>
    <p num="p-0235">Cutting a test piece for measurement from the obtained glass block, the respective characteristics (an average linear expansion coefficient α, water resistance DW, acid resistance DA, Knoop hardness Hk, and solarization) were evaluated based on Japanese Optical Glass Industrial Standard mentioned above.</p>
    <p num="p-0236">By using the on-vehicle camera lens glass material of the examples and the glass material of the comparative example, an anti-reflection (AR) coat was performed on a concave meniscus lens which has a diameter of 25 mm and a center thickness of 2 mm and was previously polished. Then, the on-vehicle camera lens was constituted of the lens as a first lens. The casing of the on-vehicle camera having the on-vehicle camera lens was dipped in an acid rain solution (sulfuric acid:nitric acid:hydrochloric acid=4:2:1) which has PH 4 and was artificially prepared. Temperature of the solution was set by 50° C. The sample was taken out after it was dipped for 1000 hours, and the surface of the lens was inspected. As a result, in the on-vehicle camera lens glass materials of the examples, there was no variation, but in the glass material of the comparative example, there was surface roughness, that is, a blurred shape formed on the surface.</p>
    <p num="p-0237">In addition, a glass piece was cut from the obtained glass block, and the glass piece was processed into a press molding material. Then, the material was heated to be soften, and was press-molded in a shape similar to a lens by using a press molding tool. Subsequently, the press-molded product was grinded and polished, and a lens was manufactured.</p>
    <p num="p-0238">In any methods mentioned above, the glass polishing process was required. Since Knoop hardness was high, the material was easy to be finished with a smooth lens surface and with high accuracy in shape. In addition, since an average linear expansion coefficient thereof was low, it was easy to prevent glass from being damaged in the grinding or the polishing process. In addition, all of examples of the on-vehicle camera lens glass materials have excellent acid resistance and water resistance. Therefore, it was possible to prevent so-called staining and dimming phenomenon caused after polishing and cleaning process.</p>
    <p num="p-0239">While the invention has been described in connection with the exemplary embodiments, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various changes and modification may be made therein without departing from the present invention, and it is aimed, therefore, to cover in the appended claim all such changes and modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
