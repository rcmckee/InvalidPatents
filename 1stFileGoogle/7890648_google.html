At least one segment is associated with a plurality of links to other segments. The method includes playing at least one segment with the temporal flow, determining whether a content expansion is desired prior to reaching the second terminus. If the content expansion is desired, then linking to an expansion segment and playing the expansion segment. If the content expansion is not desired, then linking to a continuing segment and playing the continuing segment. The method includes an additional link from the expansion segment to the continuing segment such that the continuing segment is played after the expansion segment has been played. Other aspects of the invention include other methods for playing stored content, for capturing and playing content, capturing segment and linkage descriptions, storage devices of the segment content, storage mechanisms referencing the continuous media content by segments and linkages and apparatus for capturing and playing continuous media content."><meta name="DC.date" content="2011-2-15"

At least one segment is associated with a plurality of links to other segments. The method includes playing at least one segment with the temporal flow, determining whether a content expansion is desired prior to reaching the second terminus. If the content expansion is desired, then linking to an expansion segment and playing the expansion segment. If the content expansion is not desired, then linking to a continuing segment and playing the continuing segment. The method includes an additional link from the expansion segment to the continuing segment such that the continuing segment is played after the expansion segment has been played. Other aspects of the invention include other methods for playing stored content, for capturing and playing content, capturing segment and linkage descriptions, storage devices of the segment content, storage mechanisms referencing the continuous media content by segments and linkages and apparatus for capturing and playing continuous media content.</div>

No. 7,467,218, which is a continuation of prior application No. 10/107,945, filed Mar. 26, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,615,270, which is a continuation of prior application Ser. No. 09/298,336 filed Apr. 23, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,393,158.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">This invention pertains to the storage and interactive playing of segmented continuous play media sequences, and more particularly to digitally stored interactive multimedia content.</p>
    <p num="p-0004">Continuous play media (“multimedia”) can be defined as minimally containing a stream of image or text content forming a perceived continuity when presented to an observer/user. Continuous play media may further contain content streams forming perceived audio continuities when presented to an observer/user. Continuous play media may further contain other content streams including but not limited to closed captioned support for the acoustically impaired or closed captioned presentation of dialogue in one or more alternative languages.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">Image content streams as used herein will include but not be limited to motion video streams as well as streams of text moving with regards to the displayed view available to the user/observer. Programs may generate these image streams, where the displayed view is altered in a manner rendered essentially continuous. Implementation environments for such generating programs include but are not limited to language environments for C, C++, Java, Lingo™ by Macromedia as well as various low level machine independent and/or machine dependent assembly languages. Examples of such implementations include but are not limited to motion picture preambles and postambles, often incorporating still images, textual credits and copyrights often further accompanied by music with a motion background or moving text providing a sense of continuity to the user/observer. Such image content streams may be further accompanied by acoustic effects which augment, and in some cases, establish the sense of continuity experienced by the user/observer.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">Contemporary technology has driven down the cost of storing continuous play media, allowing the recording of large amounts of audio-video content onto a compact disk or DVD disk by a growing number of people, businesses and institutions. Continuous play media recordings and the playing of such recordings began in large numbers with the video tape players and their successors, Video Cassette Recorders (VCRs). Such technologies could record and play one to several hours of television grade audio-video content. The user could control the player to rewind, fast forward, pause, stop and start at a given moment in the recorded presentation. Many of these units could record material, usually received from a television signal, as well as play pre-recorded material. Standard implementations of this technology record or play only one multi-media stream at a time without multiplexing schemes supporting multiple simultaneous streams.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">More recently, digital continuous play media technologies based upon image compression techniques such as QuickTime™ by Apple, MPEG 1, MPEG 2 and DVD have become quite popular. Such technologies are typically used to create a single long playing sequence, such as a motion picture, documentary or training session. User controls for playing such recordings are very similar to earlier controls found on video tape players and VCRs. All of these prior methods of playing and storing continuous play media have a limitation in presenting complex subjects, namely that there presentation is flat, there is no way for the user/observer to alter the stream to delve into a topic as a contiguous part of the stream.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">The Internet and World Wide Web have accelerated the proliferation of hypertext documents. Hypertext possesses highlighted triggers embedded into a viewed document, which when selected, cause the document viewer to display a different view of either the same document or a different document. There is a “back” button on most hypertext viewing systems, which when pushed, causes the view to return to the previous view. These hypertext documents are rapidly creating a new class of interactive documents, allowing a much higher level of complexity to be traversed by readers of greatly varying backgrounds. People may follow many of the hypertext links, or few of the hypertext links depending upon their preferences. However, the approach of hypertext is not continuous play media, it does not create audio-visual streams, but screens of text and pictures primarily, which only move when the user/observer urges them to move. When a hypertext document references a continuous play media file, such as a Quicktime file, it is loaded and played with controls much as a VCR possesses.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">Television, long one of the dominant cultural forces in image content presentation has reached a difficult impasse. Television in the United States is largely supported by revenues from advertising. The Internet threatens such revenues. The reason is that many perceive the Internet as a better basis for advertising because people who are interested in a product can find out what they want to know about the product as they wish to find it out via hyper links. Today's television advertising is constrained to present sound bites of very short duration possessing no ability for the potential customer to direct an inquiry into facts they wish to know. Instead, television today forces repeated transmission of the same limited amount of information, never getting beyond the simplest of messages concerning a product. What is needed is a method by which an advertiser's purchased bandwidth can be more efficiently utilized to permit potential customers to query a larger cross section of information about the products advertised while insuring that the basic product pitch is seen.</p>
    <p num="p-0010"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> displays a relevant prior art system comprising an enclosure <b>10</b>, housing a display device <b>12</b>, selector device <b>14</b>, and communication (<b>16</b> and <b>18</b>) between selector device and system plus speakers (<b>20</b>).

    <p num="p-0018">Relevant prior art player controllers <b>40</b> often, but not always, partition a continuous play media stream received via <b>38</b> from content player <b>36</b> into an audio stream and a video stream. The audio stream is sent via communication path (arrows <b>42</b> to <b>52</b> to <b>34</b>) to audio generator <b>32</b> to drive speakers <b>20</b>. This communication path may be incorporated into an overall bus protocol, or be a separate signal path, depending upon the specific implementation. The video stream would be sent via communication path (arrows <b>42</b> to <b>52</b> to <b>26</b>) to display controller <b>24</b> to drive display <b>12</b>. The actual decoding of the video stream is often done primarily in display controller <b>24</b>, but in certain instances, digital processor <b>56</b> and player controller <b>40</b> may contribute to the video decoding process. There are also situations in which relevant prior art systems employ display controller <b>24</b> to partition a continuous play media stream into separate one or more audio streams and at least one video stream. Such systems include many set top box architectures.</p>
    <p num="p-0019">Note that in relevant prior art systems, there may be more than one content player <b>36</b> with potentially distinct player controllers <b>40</b> and communication paths <b>38</b>.

    <p num="p-0020">Another relevant source of continuous play media content is provided via external content <b>44</b> communicating with external interface <b>48</b> via arrow <b>46</b>.

    <p num="p-0022">The external content <b>44</b> may be located a substantial distance away from the enclosure <b>10</b>. The external content <b>44</b> is often embodied in many circumstances within a server supporting a network of user systems via interconnections <b>46</b> of these external interfaces <b>48</b>. Such networks may well support TCP/IP thereby enabling support for the Internet. Such networks may further support one or more Intranets. Such networks may further support one or more Extranets.</p>
    <p num="p-0023">Another form of external content <b>44</b> includes video input devices. These often possess external interfaces <b>48</b>, which include video frame capturing circuitry. Such external interfaces <b>48</b> are now including advanced image processing, often further supporting MPEG compatible compression of the captured video stream.</p>
    <p num="p-0024">Note that in many relevant prior art systems, there is more than one kind of external content <b>44</b> and external interface <b>48</b> with potentially different communication paths <b>46</b>. A desktop box might possess both a RF tuner using an antenna as well as an optical fiber interface to a cable television provider.

    <p num="p-0026">Relevant prior art digital processors <b>56</b> often possess local memory resources in the form of RAM <b>62</b> and nonvolatile memory <b>66</b>, interfaced via busses <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>64</b> and <b>68</b>.

Such nonvolatile memory <b>66</b> embodiments may be used to initialize the system as well as provide security and accounting information or store content.</p>
    <p num="p-0027">From the user perspective, relevant prior art systems play continuous play media content recordings much as did predecessor VCR systems. They can start at the beginning, or partially through a sequence, and progress forward pausing, stopping and possibly rewinding. Internet access has allowed hypertext-based web sites to provide hot keys supporting the downloading and playing of continuous play media sequences, but again, once downloaded, the continuous play media sequence playing controls are essentially those found on a VCR Modern television, particularly cable and satellite broadcast television possesses a fairly large number of channels, often over a hundred, to be multiplexed and modulated at the broadcast site and demodulated at the customer/user site into these separate channels. The signal protocols in common use deserve some discussion. These relevant, prior art television channels tend to employ an MPEG continuous play media stream, with an audio stream and a video stream component.</p>
    <p num="p-0028">Consider first what happens in the video stream. MPEG video compression mechanisms utilize an initializing video frame compressed in a manner similar to a still frame, followed by motion compensation data essentially transforming this initial frame into a succession of subsequent motion frames. Every so often, a new initializing frame is sent, followed by motion compensation data again transforming the new initial frame into a new sequence of subsequent motion frames. The compression ratios compared to the raw data are impressive, often a reduction in data size of 200 to 1 can be achieved without noticeable loss of visual clarity. This compression ratio enables this large number of channels to be cost effectively broadcast by satellite and cable television companies.</p>
    <p num="p-0029">Consider what happens when someone changes television channels. The MPEG stream of the new channel is isolated and demodulated from the television broadband transmission into a video stream and an audio stream. The video stream is scanned until the next initializing video frame is encountered. Once encountered, the MPEG video decoder initializes its output stream and motion video frames follow shortly from this initialization frame. These initialization frames occur frequently enough that there is a barely noticeable delay between when one turns to a new channel and the channel's video stream is being displayed. If at this point, the channel is again changed, a short time later there is another initialization video frame observed, the motion frame sequencing begins again. However, there is no mechanism to compensate for or retain whatever has transpired on the original channel. Once these motion frame sequences have passed by, they are gone.</p>
    <p num="p-0030">The audio streams also possess an initialization structure which is asserted from time to time, followed by the time varying incremental audio stream modifications. While the audio and video frames do not necessarily initialize simultaneously, there are synchronization controls between them to facilitate time-aligning them to each other. Taken collectively, there is a certain rationale in considering contemporary continuous play media to be segmented. The block coding used in both transmission and storage of digital continuous play media reinforces the sense of segmentation of continuous play media into short sequences of motion frames (video stream) and the associated audio stream. However, there are no embedded cues within these streams to indicate expansion possibilities or to direct such expansions, or direct the return to provide continuity with the original stream segments.</p>
    <p num="p-0031">What is needed is a method of playing and storing a segmented continuous play media stream which expands and contracts the viewing material based upon the user/observer's and/or system/agent(s)' selections.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0032">One aspect of the invention is implemented as a method for playing a stored content providing a plurality of segments which collectively contains the stored content. Each of the segments has a first terminus and a second terminus, where the content in each of the segments has a temporal flow from the first terminus to the second terminus. At least one segment is associated with a plurality of links to a corresponding plurality of other segments.</p>
    <p num="p-0033">The method includes playing at least one segment with the temporal flow, determining whether a content expansion is desired prior to reaching the second terminus. If the content expansion is desired, then linking to an expansion segment and playing the expansion segment. If the content expansion is not desired, then linking to a continuing segment and playing the continuing segment. The method includes an additional link from the expansion segment to the continuing segment such that the continuing segment is played after the expansion segment has been played.</p>
    <p num="p-0034">This method is advantageous in providing the user and content provider with a much greater degree of freedom in traversing the content provided. Topics can be expanded upon user request. The individual who wants to know about the gas mileage of an automobile shown in a commercial may find out about it, whereas someone interested in the safety features can delve into that while the advertiser is assured that the basic advertising pitch will be presented in a cinematic fashion.</p>
    <p num="p-0035">Another aspect of the invention includes a method for playing a stored content providing a plurality of segments which collectively comprise the stored content. Each of the segments has a first terminus and a second terminus and a continuity link associated with a member of the collection of a segment indicator and a non-segment indicator. Content in each of the segments has a temporal flow from the first terminus to the second terminus. At least one segment is associated with a plurality of expansion links to a corresponding plurality of other of the segments.</p>
    <p num="p-0036">The method of playing includes: Playing the at least one segment with the temporal flow. Determining whether a content expansion is desired prior to reaching the second terminus. If the content expansion is desired, then linking to an expansion segment, pushing the continuity link onto a link stack and playing the expansion segment. If the content expansion is not desired and if the continuity link indicates the continuing segment then linking to a continuing segment and playing the continuing segment.</p>
    <p num="p-0037">This method is advantageous in providing the user and content provider with a much greater degree of freedom in traversing the content provided. Topics can be expanded upon user request. The individual who wants to know about the gas mileage of an automobile shown in a commercial may find out about it, whereas someone interested in the safety features can delve into that while the advertiser is assured that the basic advertising pitch will be presented in a cinematic fashion.</p>
    <p num="p-0038">This method is further advantageous in providing the ability to share an expansion segment or collection of nested expansion segments in more than one segment designating the same expansion segment. Such segments capable of being shared as expansion segments are indicated by continuity segment links indicating a non-segment.</p>
    <p num="p-0039">Another aspect of the invention includes a storage device for a segmented continuous play media stream containing at least three segments. Each segment contains a first terminus and a second terminus. The segmented continuous play media stream within each segment progresses from the first terminus to the second terminus.</p>
    <p num="p-0040">At least one segment of the storage device contains a plurality of links to a corresponding plurality of other segments further comprising a continuation link and at least one expansion link. A cue is associated with each of the expansion links. Each cue may be stored in the containing segment substantially before the segmented continuous play media stream progresses to the second terminus of the containing segment. The segmented continuous play media stream of the containing segment progresses to the first terminus of the corresponding continuation link segment after progress to the containing segment second terminus. The segmented continuous play media stream of the containing segment progresses to the first terminus of the corresponding expansion link segment after progress to the containing segment second terminus.</p>
    <p num="p-0041">Such a storage device is advantageous for providing segmented continuous play media which may by played by the above methods which provide a much greater degree of freedom in traversing the stored content. Topics can be expanded upon user request. The individual who wants to know about the gas mileage of an automobile shown in a commercial may find out about it, whereas someone interested in the safety features can delve into that while the advertiser is assured that the basic advertising pitch will be traversed in a cinematic fashion.</p>
    <p num="p-0042">Another aspect of the invention includes a storage mechanism referencing a continuous play media stream segment store containing a collection of at least three segment descriptors and a collection of at least one expansion link element.</p>
    <p num="p-0043">Each of the segment descriptors of the storage mechanism contains a first terminus, a second terminus and a continuity link. The first terminus referencing a first time point of a continuous play media stream segment contained in the continuous play media stream segment store. The second terminus referencing a second time point of the continuous play media stream segment contained in the continuous play media stream segment store. The continuity link represents one of a collection containing an indicator of another of the segment descriptors and an indicator to a non-segment.</p>
    <p num="p-0044">Each of the expansion link elements of the storage mechanism contains an expansion segment indicator, an expansion cue indicator and an indicator of another of the expansion link elements or of a non-expansion link element. Each of the segment descriptors further contains an indicator of an expansion link element.</p>
    <p num="p-0045">Such a storage mechanism is advantageous for providing segmented continuous play media which may by played by the above methods which provide a much greater degree of freedom in traversing the stored content. Topics can be expanded upon user request. The individual who wants to know about the gas mileage of an automobile shown in a commercial may find out about it, whereas someone interested in the safety features can delve into that while the advertiser is assured that the basic advertising pitch will be traversed in a cinematic fashion.</p>
    <p num="p-0046">Such a storage mechanism is further advantageous in supporting more than one mechanism whereby alternative traversal of a common continuous play media library is provided. One traversal of a television soap opera library may focus on character evolution, whereas another may focus on family relationships and another, on adulterous relationships. Such traversals would reference the common continuous play media library, but establish at least partially divergent expansions.</p>
    <p num="p-0047">Another aspect of the invention includes a method for capturing and playing a continuous content including capturing a plurality of segments, playing at least one stored content segment, determining whether a content expansion is desired, linking to other segments and playing other segments.</p>
    <p num="p-0048">The method includes capturing of at least one continuous play media stream collectively contains the continuous content providing corresponding stored content segments each having a first terminus and a second terminus, where the content has a temporal flow from the first terminus to the second terminus. At least one segment is associated with a plurality of links to a corresponding plurality of the other segments.</p>
    <p num="p-0049">The method further includes playing the stored content segment with temporal flow and determining whether a content expansion is desired prior to reaching the second terminus. If the content expansion is desired then linking to an expansion segment and playing the expansion segment of stored content. If the content expansion is not desired then linking to a continuing segment of stored content and playing the continuing segment of stored content. There is an additional link from the expansion segment of stored content to the continuing segment of stored content such that the continuing segment of stored content is played after the expansion segment of stored content has been played.</p>
    <p num="p-0050">This method advantageously provides for the capturing of a continuous play media stream content and playing of that content. Different users can play and expand the content based upon their individual choices. By way of example, a viewer of a sporting event may chose to expand recent performances of a team or team member, whereas another viewer may chose to examine recent news and interviews with a coach or team manager.</p>
    <p num="p-0051">A further advantage of this method is the ability for selected advertising to gain in depth rather than just repeat or rotate the same prespecified commercial content with no added informational depth on demand. This supports a smarter use of advertising content, providing advertisers with the ability to build up information content, with a kinesthetic interface to expand and examine selected details otherwise unavailable through a media such as television as it is known today.</p>
    <p num="p-0052">Another aspect of the invention includes a method of capturing references to a continuous play media stream segment store including capturing a collection of at least three segment descriptors and capturing a collection of at least one expansion link elements.</p>
    <p num="p-0053">Each of the segment descriptors of the method includes a first terminus, a second terminus and a continuity link. The first terminus references a first time point of a continuous play media stream segment contained in the continuous play media stream segment store. The second terminus references a second time point of the continuous play media stream segment contained in the continuous play media stream segment store. The continuity link represents one of a collection including an indicator of another of the segment descriptors and an indicator to a non-segment.</p>

Each of the segment descriptors further includes one of the indicators of one of the expansion link element.</p>
    <p num="p-0055">This method advantageously provides for the capture of references to a continuous play media stream segment store supporting differing expansion services. In a sporting event expansion service: one service may support recent sporting performances, another might incorporate performance statistics and a third might support recent interviews and expert commentary related to specific players or teams.</p>
    <p num="p-0056">Another aspect of the invention includes an apparatus to store and play a continuous play media stream including an external interface circuit, a writeable content store, a digital controller, a display circuit and a selector circuit. The external interface circuit receives at least one continuous play media stream segment. The writeable content store is coupled to the external interface circuit by which the segments of the received continuous play media stream may be transferred and stored. The digital controller is coupled to the external interface circuit and is coupled to the writeable content store. The digital controller further contains a link segment association table. The display circuit is coupled to the digital controller. The display circuit is further coupled to the writeable content store.

    <p num="p-0060">A further advantage of this apparatus is the ability for selected advertising to gain in depth rather than just repeat the same commercial content with no added informational depth.

    <p num="p-0112"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref> depicts an annotation chart shown for use in designing a continuous play expansion segment system in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. One of the first stages in making an expansion segment content is the acquisition of continuous media stream components. As was previously discussed, MPEG streams can be addressed down to specific frames in a temporal sequence. It is to be noted that raw video streams may be digitally captured and are also addressable down to individual frames. This figure depicts the stage in the creation process when the designer has captured frame sequences <b>300</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>322</b>, <b>324</b>, <b>326</b>, <b>328</b> and <b>330</b>. The figure represents one conceptual model of an annotation system where the scope, content and duration of the frame sequences can be viewed in preparation for creating the links associated with the completed expansion media product. Note that the specific frame sequences <b>300</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>322</b>, <b>324</b>, <b>326</b>, <b>328</b> and <b>330</b> may be modified over time by the edit process of which this chart is but one component.</p>
    <p num="p-0113">In certain preferred embodiments of the invention, this chart uses a notation in which number of timing relation relationships can be derived. Two frame sequences may be temporally abutting, such as sequence <b>322</b> and sequence <b>324</b>, where the second terminus of frame sequence <b>322</b> and the first terminus of sequence <b>324</b> are essentially temporally adjacent to each other. Frame sequences <b>326</b> and <b>328</b> display a temporal gap, where the second terminus of frame sequence <b>326</b> occurs a perceptible time before the first terminus of frame sequence <b>328</b> occurs.</p>
    <p num="p-0114">Frame sequence <b>320</b> is nested within frame sequence <b>300</b>, where the first terminus of frame sequence <b>300</b> occurs at the same time or before the first terminus of <b>320</b>, and the second terminus of frame sequence <b>320</b> occurs at the same time or before the second terminus of frame sequence <b>300</b>. Frame sequences <b>322</b> and <b>326</b> share simultaneous starting times, where each frame sequence's first terminus occurs at essentially the same time. Frame sequences <b>328</b> and <b>330</b> share simultaneous ending times, where each frame sequence's second terminus occurs at essentially the same time.</p>
    <p num="p-0115">Frame sequences <b>324</b> and <b>328</b> overlap, where the first terminus of the first frame sequence <b>324</b> occurs before the first terminus of the second frame sequence <b>328</b> and the second terminus of the second frame sequence <b>328</b> occurs after the second terminus of the first frame sequence <b>324</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0116">Frame sequence <b>320</b> spans frames sequences <b>322</b> and <b>324</b>, in that the first terminus of frame sequence <b>320</b> occurs before the second terminus of frame sequence <b>322</b> and the second terminus of frame sequence <b>320</b> occurs after the first terminus of frame sequence <b>324</b>. Another example of spanning frame sequences <b>322</b> and <b>324</b> could also include a segment starting at <b>306</b> and ending at <b>310</b> in certain preferred embodiments of the invention. Such a segment would have a first terminus <b>306</b> occurring before the second terminus of frame sequence <b>322</b> and the second terminus of frame sequence, <b>310</b> occurs after the first terminus of frame sequence <b>324</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0117">In certain preferred embodiments of the invention, the end product of the segmentation design process is presentation upon a broadcast media, where bandwidth and local user content storage constraints may necessitate organizing priorities for transmission and storage of the edited content. To this end and by way of example, consider the following additional structural elements where the frame sequences are organized into horizontal rows for certain further preferred embodiments of the invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0118">Frame sequence <b>300</b> is the top level of the presentation. This is the basic material, which the designer wishes the users/observers to traverse. In a documentary setting, this is the basic information. In a fictional setting, such as a soap opera, dram or comedy, this is the basic episodic presentation. In an advertising setting, this is the basic pitch material, often limited to 20 to 30 seconds induration, which is currently transmitted repetitiously many times with no additional content. In sports settings, this is the athletic event with commercials and intermission events, which possess no ability for the users/observers to focus the presentation upon their specific interests. This is the entirety of what can be presented today.</p>
    <p num="p-0119">The second horizontal layer contains a single frame sequence <b>320</b>. Note that at this stage in the editing process, no segment linkages have been determined, so that while the material of <b>320</b> is continuous, it may be subsequently partitioned into more than one segment. In other circumstances, flame sequence <b>320</b> may be provided with premature contraction points. Segmentation and premature contraction points can be advantageously placed in an advertising setting within say the sporting event presentation to allow the users to return to the sporting event when the action on the field resumes, by way of example. Note that in certain preferred embodiments, the second row may represent the preceding episode of a fictional, historical or documentary series. In certain other preferred embodiments, the second row might be the second highest priority information documenting a product or service in an advertisement.</p>
    <p num="p-0120">The third horizontal layer contains frame sequences <b>322</b> and <b>324</b>. In certain circumstances, these frame sequences may represent frame sequences from a previous episode which remain relevant, for instance, where the advertisers have stopped supporting a series, the removed frame sequences may be their previous advertisements. In certain other preferred embodiments, the content of the previous episode may have been rendered irrelevant by subsequent events and therefore no longer relevant to be stored. In certain other preferred embodiments of the invention, each layer has lower priority for transmission and/or storage, so that in various embodiments, the content of a layer may either be given a lower bandwidth budget or local user storage budget. Many of the compression technologies in use and under development support what is known as progressive encoding, which permits the allocation of varying amounts of bandwidth and/or storage for specific segments, or in the case, layers of segments.</p>
    <p num="p-0121">The fourth horizontal layer contains frame sequences <b>326</b> and <b>328</b>. In certain circumstances, these frame sequences may represent frame sequences from a previous episode which remain relevant, for instance, where the advertisers have stopped supporting a series, the removed frame sequences may be their previous advertisements. In certain other preferred embodiments, the content of the previous episode may have been rendered irrelevant by subsequent events and therefore no longer relevant to be stored.</p>
    <p num="p-0122">The fifth horizontal layer includes one frame sequence <b>330</b>. This may represent an archival frame sequence where the primary characters were introduced in certain preferred embodiments of the invention. This may also an archival frame sequence where the current dominant plot in a soap opera was introduced in certain preferred embodiments of the invention. In certain other preferred embodiments of the invention, this may represent an overview to an advertiser's product line.</p>
    <p num="p-0123">In certain alternative preferred embodiments of the invention, continuous play stream <b>300</b> is the “raw” continuous play stream, such the footage of interview, athletic event, or soap opera, by way of example.

Segment <b>320</b> is a subsequence of sequence <b>300</b>, where the person being interviewed may discuss a specific handbag that they own. In sequence <b>322</b>, the subject is showing their wallet. In sequence <b>326</b>, the subject discusses how they acquired the wallet. In sequence <b>324</b>, the subject demonstrates one of the contents of the handbag, such as a concert ticket.

    <p num="p-0124">The storage of the “raw” content need only be done once. The segment descriptions represent a very amount of data compared to the continuous play streams they reference. One second of MPEG 2 audio-video content is typically between one half to one megabyte. Each segment referencing that content would typically take less than a few hundred bytes in many preferred embodiments of the invention and might well reference many seconds of content. The separation of segment description tables from the storage of continuous play content is thus advantageous in certain preferred embodiment of the invention. The segment description tables may thus be supplied separately from the “raw” continuous play media stream in certain other preferred embodiments.</p>
