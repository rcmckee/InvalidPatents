No. 09/217,116 filed on Dec. 21, 1998 and Ser. No. 09/419,266 filed on Oct. 15, 1999.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">1. Technical Field</p>
    <p num="p-0004">The present invention relates to a human resource management system. More specifically, this invention relates to a human resource management system for performing substitute fulfillment, compiling absence and entitlement information, notifications of unexpected events, schedules, instructional information, and notifications of benefits and policies.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">2. Background Information</p>
    <p num="p-0006">To date, locating a substitute to fill a temporary employee absence in an organization, a process referred to as “substitute fulfillment,” has generally been an unreliable, labor-intensive, and often panic-driven process. In any organization, the absence of a worker can have tangible consequences throughout the workplace. The effects of an employee absence vary with the nature of the work environment and with the scope of the employee's position. For example, upcoming deadlines and patterns of absenteeism can have different consequences within a particular organization. These consequences may be immediate and drastic, as when an assembly line shuts down due to the absence of a critical worker on the line or an airline pilot is not able to report to duty, or more attenuated and moderate, as when another employee is distracted from his primary task to answer telephones due to the absence of the office receptionist. These consequences may also include diversion of management resources to address the consequences of the absence; delays in accomplishing projects in which the absentee has a role; displacement of other employees who must fulfill the absentee's role, either by express assignment or in order to complete their own tasks; reduced productivity; fines levied against the organization, particularly if the absence impacts safety or other government-regulated aspects of the work environment; and, in an extreme but not uncommon case, the inability to complete the central task of the organization.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">In the latter case, assignment of a substitute worker is imperative or “mission-critical”—without the substitute worker, the mission of the organization will not go forward. In this instance, filling the vacancy with a temporary substitute is the only acceptable alternative. In other cases, assignment of a substitute worker may not be mission-critical, but may nevertheless be a preferred policy in order to minimize the consequences of any absence. As a result, an upcoming absence may impact the workplace even before the absence period begins, as managers consider ways of compensating for the absence. Examples of work environments in which substitute fulfillment may be a mission-critical task include schools, emergency services, security services, airlines, and manufacturing plants, particularly plants with an assembly-line operation. The substitute of an absent teacher with a substitute teacher is a commonly occurring example of a mission-critical substitute-fulfillment objective.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">Thus, when an employee notifies the organization that the employee will be absent, in an organization where a substitute is necessary or desired, management must necessarily turn its attention to the substitute fulfillment task or risk a noticeable reduction in the productivity of the organization or an inability to accomplish the business of the organization for the entire absence period. Although seemingly simple in concept, the substitute fulfillment task is non-trivial, requiring managers to devote significant time, effort and other resources, with no guarantee of success. The number of intermediate tasks that must be accomplished and constraints that must be satisfied to successfully realize a particular substitute in a timely manner complicates substitute fulfillment.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">The absent worker often provides notice of his or her impending absence less than a day, or even only several hours, before the worker is expected at work. Thus, management typically enters the substitute fulfillment task with little time to carry it out. Should there be no automation of the process in any aspect, then management must direct each step of the process.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">Once the absence, which may extend from only hours to several days, or even months, is known, management must typically identify the scope of the absentee worker's critical responsibilities and skills to establish criteria for identifying a suitable substitute and develop a substitution candidate profile. Typically, multiple substitution candidate profiles may be established, with more demanding requirements for ideal or preferred substitutes, and with less demanding, threshold requirements for merely acceptable substitutes. Once the appropriate qualifications for an acceptable substitute are established, management may consider potential substitutes from a prepared list of candidates, or alternatively, management may identify potential candidates by some other means. Candidates may be regular employees of the affected workplace, for example, assembly line workers at a manufacturing plant who work different shifts from the absentee, or, persons from outside the workplace, for example, substitute teachers registered with a school district.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">Management must then contact potential substitutes, typically by telephone, and determine whether potential substitutes are available and willing to work at the desired times in the desired position. Merely reaching potential substitutes may require several attempts. In the best case, management will eventually locate and assign an available substitute to cover the vacancy. In the worst case, management will be unable to find a substitute, despite having expended significant resources on the substitute fulfillment task. The substitute fulfillment task is substantially, but not wholly, complete when the available substitute is assigned. Typically, management performing the substitute fulfillment must then notify the appropriate persons that a substitute has been confirmed to facilitate inclusion of the substitute in the workplace. Due to the complexity of the substitute fulfillment task and the diversion of resources it entails, many workplaces may forego substitute fulfillment despite its desirability.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">Substitute fulfillment is a routine practice in the education system, especially at the primary and secondary school levels. An example of substitute fulfillment for a high school teacher is provided herein as an accessible example and for reference. The substitute fulfillment task usually is triggered in a school when a teacher “calls in sick.” Depending on the degree to which substitute fulfillment is automated in the school or district, locating a substitute teacher may require the efforts of a principal or other administrator, as well as several support staff members. Once a teacher has called in sick or otherwise signaled his absence, perhaps the night before or even the morning of the absence, the responsible administrator must disrupt her schedule to focus on the substitute fulfillment task. If she is unable to find a substitute teacher, the operation of the class, the department, and even the whole school may be disrupted. For example, the affected classes may fall behind in their scheduled curricula, an administrator or other teachers may have to neglect their other duties to cover for the absentee, and/or the school may be fined by the state for failing to provide an acceptable substitute teacher.</p>
    <p num="p-0013">In order to perform the substitute fulfillment, generally the administrator first must determine which classes the absent teacher teaches and what skills are required of a substitute. For example, if an absent teacher is a high school science teacher who teaches AP Physics and basic chemistry, a substitute may be required not only to have a college degree but also specifically to have pursued college-level classes in both subjects. The administrator may then identify acceptable substitutes from those substitutes registered with the school district. The administrator then telephones potential substitutes to check their availability and willingness to take on the assignment. Often, the administrator may have to telephone an individual substitute several times to speak with the individual substitute and obtain a response. If the administrator locates and confirms a substitute, the administrator then has to inform the relevant school head or other teachers and complete paperwork for processing the substitute assignment.</p>
    <p num="p-0014">Presently, computer systems for supporting substitute fulfillment are known in the education field. Individual schools in a school district typically share a single such system installed at the school district level. Typical system equipment includes at least one dedicated computer, combined with specialized telephony equipment, including multiple phone lines, and other equipment. The equipment is expensive and set-up of the substitute fulfillment system may be technically demanding. A school district must invest in equipment adequate to handle its anticipated volume of use. In order to upgrade the system, often all of the equipment must be replaced, at substantial expense and inconvenience.</p>
    <p num="p-0015">In these automated systems, necessary information relating to teachers, substitution criteria, registered substitutes, etc., is entered and maintained in a database through software on the system at the school district level. Individual schools may receive daily absence information from the school district office via facsimile. School district personnel must receive absence notification and initiate and oversee the substitute fulfillment procedure with support from the system. Significant involvement by school district personnel and the system vendor may be required, including hardware and software support of the system.</p>
    <p num="p-0016">In light of the mission-critical nature of the substitute fulfillment task in the education system, the reliability of the system is a key concern. At present, substitute fulfillment systems are not adequately reliable. Power failures, computer network interruptions, telephone outages, computer system failures, unauthorized tampering, computer security crime, and other catastrophic events may undermine the efficacy of systems operated at the school district level. Because all information is maintained locally at the school district level, system failures may result in partial or total data loss. Backup systems entail additional expense, often not within the budgets of school systems.</p>
    <p num="p-0017">Present systems are inherently limited in their capabilities due to equipment limitations, access constraints, and operation requirements; thus, each district typically purchases and installs a system and independently handles its own substitute fulfillment using the purchased system. As a result of the decentralized nature of substitute fulfillment management in present systems, it is virtually impossible for school districts to share information and common substitute fulfillment resources. For the same reason, compilation or aggregation of data relating to substitute fulfillment across school districts is difficult and uncommon. All of the costs, responsibilities, disadvantages, and inconveniences of substitute fulfillment are typically borne exclusively and separately by individual school districts and schools.</p>
    <p num="p-0018">Additionally, organizations including but not limited to schools, school districts and business entities require a centralized system and method of tracking worker's absences and entitlements, including but not limited to used and available vacation, personal and sick time. Administrators and workers have a time-consuming, inefficient and often inaccurate procedures for recording absences and entitlements. This results in labor-intensive recordation procedures and often no universal record (for access by both administrators and workers) detailing up-to-date absences and entitlements for the particular worker, a group of workers, or the overall workforce of the organization.</p>
    <p num="p-0019">Organizations also require an efficient, current and easily accessible system and method for recording and announcing benefits, policies, current and unexpected events. Presently, organizations often resort to bulletin boards, which are not remotely accessible, or phone chains, which are inefficient, unreliable, and labor-intensive.</p>
    <p num="p-0020">Illustrated here with particular examples, these same considerations are generally applicable to any organization. Due to the mission-critical nature of these tasks, it is crucial that any equipment or method relating to substitute fulfillment, information compilation or notification be reliable and efficient. It is an advantage of the present invention to provide a reliable, efficient system and method of substitute fulfillment, information compilation and notification. It is a further advantage of the present invention to provide an automated system and method that has low overhead and requires little organization involvement or oversight. It is another advantage of the present invention to broaden the scope of system connectivity and to include an interface to the Internet. It is yet another advantage of the present invention to maintain a central database of related information and to process data across multiple independent organizations. It is still another advantage of the present invention to provide trend analysis and reporting. A system and method for substitute fulfillment, information compilation and notification is useful to any organization that anticipates a need to assign substitute workers to fill temporary absences.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0021">The present invention is directed to an automated system and method for performing substitute fulfillment for an organization that wishes to replace an employee during a temporary absence; performing placement of floating workers; tracking absences and entitlements of workers; notifying interested parties regarding unexpected events, daily announcements, policies and benefits; and bidding for temporary workers. In a preferred embodiment, the substitute fulfillment system includes a server configured for managing substitute fulfillment, compiling information, and notifying parties for multiple client organizations. The server maintains substitute fulfillment data, contact data, notification information and other data in a database for one or more client organizations employing the system. Organizations enter substitute fulfillment data and contact data via a website hosted by the server. The system sends updates to and receives updates from an organization's local database via the Internet or a telephone network.</p>
    <p num="p-0022">In a preferred embodiment, an employee registers an absence by contacting the substitute fulfillment system. In another preferred embodiment, a business entity such as a school or school district registers contact information and the system contacts the desired parties regarding unexpected events, benefits, policies or daily announcements. Yet another embodiment encompasses a system which tracks information regarding worker's absences and entitlements.</p>
    <p num="p-0023">In a preferred embodiment, the system provides the organization with the absence information. Once an absence is registered, the substitute fulfillment system uses the database to identify potential substitutes, temporary workers or floating workers (“substitutes”) based on preferences or matching criteria selected by the organization and other information. The system then contacts the identified potential substitutes to inquire regarding their availability. In a preferred embodiment, the system continues to contact potential substitutes until one accepts the assignment or until the list is exhausted and all potential substitutes have refused the assignment.</p>
    <p num="p-0024">If a substitute accepts the assignment, the system relays instructions, key information and messages from the worker to the substitute, if necessary. Whether or not a substitute is successfully assigned, the system contacts the organization and other desired recipients to report on the result. In a preferred embodiment, the system relies on multiple communications channels to ensure reliability.</p>
    <p num="p-0025">The system can also track the absences of each particular worker and the worker's entitlements. Upon accessing the system, the worker or an administrator can inquire about the worker's absences and entitlements. The system stores the information on the absences and entitlements in the database.</p>
    <p num="p-0026">In another embodiment, the system records announcements regarding unexpected or current events, benefits or policies when the system is accessed by an authorized party for this purpose. The system then contacts the interested parties regarding the announcement, or allows the interested parties to access the announcement upon request. Additionally, if desired, reports detailing the contacted parties and the parties with which contact has been unsuccessful may be generated.</p>
    <p num="p-0027">In another embodiment, the system can receive registration information from substitute workers who are not affiliated with a specific client. The registrant's information and professional skills can be made available to interested clients who will, upon approval, use this substitute worker for placement in their organization.</p>
    <p num="p-0028">In another embodiment, the system allows substitutes to select positions available with multiple unaffiliated organizations. The substitute worker can manage their availability and work schedule across these multiple non-affiliated organizations.</p>
    <p num="p-0029">In another embodiment, the system retrieves a list of available jobs and displays the list to a substitute worker once the substitute worker establishes a connection with the computer network. The substitute worker is able to select a position from the list without having to access the website, e.g., using an instant messaging system.</p>
    <p num="p-0030">In yet another embodiment, the system is able to conduct auctions of idle temporary workers. An organization that requires temporary workers may designate the skills and background required of the worker, the date and time for the position, as well as with the price the organization is willing to pay. The system then fulfills these requests starting with the highest bidder.</p>
    <p num="p-0031">It is understood that “workplace” or “organization” or “entity”, when used in this application, refers not only to more traditional work environments, but to any work environment amenable to substitute fulfillment, information compilation or notification, such as an employee unit that works cooperatively together within a larger organization, for example, an emergency services unit.</p>

In a preferred embodiment, the present invention is an Internet Application Server Provider (ASP), or a thin-client.</p>
    <p num="p-0060">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, a block diagram of an exemplary server in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. According to a preferred embodiment, the substitute fulfillment system <b>10</b> operates on a server <b>12</b> by executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in the main memory <b>46</b>. Such instructions may be read into main memory <b>46</b> from another computer readable medium, such as a storage device <b>50</b>. Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in main memory <b>46</b> causes processor <b>52</b> to perform the process steps described herein. One or more processors <b>52</b> in a multi-processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the sequences of instructions contained in main memory <b>46</b>. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the invention. Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.</p>
    <p num="p-0061">The server <b>12</b> can be coupled via the bus <b>44</b> to a display <b>56</b>, such as a cathode ray tube (CRT), for displaying information. An input device <b>58</b>, including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to the bus <b>44</b> for communicating information and command selections to processor <b>52</b>. Another type of user input device is a cursor control <b>60</b>, such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to processor <b>52</b> and for controlling cursor movement on the display <b>56</b>. This input device typically has two degrees of freedom in two axes, a first axis (e.g., x) and a second axis (e.g., y), that allows the device to specify positions in a plane.</p>
    <p num="p-0062">The term “computer-readable medium” as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to processor <b>52</b> for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks. Volatile media include dynamic memory, such as main memory <b>46</b>. Transmission media include coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including conductors that comprise a bus <b>44</b>. Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic or electromagnetic waves, such as those generated during radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) data communications. Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, DVD, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, any other physical medium, with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM (programmable ROM), and EPROM (electronically PROM) a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer can read.</p>
    <p num="p-0063">Various forms of computer-readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to processor for execution. For example, the instructions may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. The remote computer can load instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to computer system can receive the data on the telephone line and use an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal. An infrared detector coupled to the bus <b>44</b> can receive the data carried in the infrared signal and place the data on the bus <b>44</b>. Bus <b>44</b> carries the data to main memory <b>46</b>, from which processor <b>52</b> retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory <b>46</b> may optionally be stored on storage device <b>50</b> either before or after execution by processor.</p>
    <p num="p-0064">Computer system also includes a communication interface <b>54</b> coupled to bus <b>44</b>. The communication interface <b>54</b> provides a two-way data communication coupling to a communication link <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>. The communication interface <b>54</b> provides an interface between the IVR system <b>25</b> and the website interface <b>26</b> and the communication links <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, respectively. For example, the communication interface <b>54</b> may be an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card or modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. As another example, communication interface <b>54</b> may be a local area network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links may also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication interface <b>54</b> sends and receives electrical, radio frequency, or optical signals that carry digital streams representing various types of information.</p>
    <p num="p-0065">The server <b>12</b> can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), communication link <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> and communication interface <b>54</b>. In the Internet example, the server <b>12</b> can transmit a requested code for an application program through the communication interface <b>54</b> and Internet <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0066">Registering with the System</p>
    <p num="p-0067">Client organizations must register with the substitute fulfillment system <b>10</b> in order for the system <b>10</b> to secure a substitute worker for an absent worker. The registration process requires a client organization to provide the registration information necessary to perform substitute fulfillment. In a preferred embodiment, the client organization provides this registration information in a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet can be sent via email or placed on a computer medium and sent in the mail. A worker then enters the registration information into the database <b>14</b> for the client organization.</p>
    <p num="p-0068">In an alternate embodiment, a client organization uses an applet, e.g., a registration “wizard,” to enter the registration information. The wizard presents a series of interfaces for guiding the organization through the registration process. Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, preferably, the registration wizard interface <b>250</b> requires the organization to submit identification <b>260</b> and billing information <b>258</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0069">In a preferred embodiment, the server <b>12</b> displays one or more webpages that provide a client organization a series of forms to complete in order to build records, which are key to substitute identification for each worker <b>30</b> or potential substitute <b>32</b>, as well as other records necessary for ancillary tasks. Examples of other records include general customer information and reporting preferences. The webpages are preferably tailored for collecting data needed to perform substitute fulfillment in the work environment of the organization. For example, if the customer is a school, the webpages can be tailored to collect data related to teachers, such as education background, certifications, schedules, and course information. The forms preferably conform to the data records that will be maintained by the server <b>12</b> in the database <b>14</b>. The webpages may aid the client in completing particular fields in the forms by providing drop-down lists with options for that field.</p>
    <p num="p-0070">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a sample data structure <b>150</b> of a possible Pick-Lists that can be generated is illustrated. For example, the drop-down list may provide a list of all courses taught at the school so that the client can select the classes taught by a particular teacher to fill in that teacher's record. The server <b>12</b> can also automatically fill in certain fields for the client by drawing on information stored in other records. For example, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</figref>, once a school has completed a school data record <b>166</b>, the server <b>12</b> can fill in the school contact information <b>176</b>, <b>178</b>, and <b>180</b> for each teacher affiliated with a particular school. Once the information has been entered into the system <b>10</b>, the information can subsequently be updated using the webpages via website interface <b>26</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0071">In another embodiment, the primary data elements of the system <b>10</b> such as a worker, substitute worker and location data, can be electronically transmitted between a client's existing system and the system <b>10</b>, thereby eliminating the need for manual data entry. The electronic exchange of such data elements can be bi-directional, e.g., as soon as a specific worker's record is modified on the client's system, the data can be propagated from the client's system to the system <b>10</b>, and vice versa where as soon as the worker records is modified in the system <b>10</b>, the modified data can be electronically transmitted to the client's system.</p>
    <p num="p-0072">Typical Data Records in the System</p>
    <p num="p-0073">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-10</figref>, exemplary data records for a school district client according to an embodiment of the present invention are illustrated. The data records illustrate types of information that the system <b>10</b> typically uses, and how that information would typically be organized. In a preferred embodiment, the information in the data records is provided to the system <b>10</b> through the website interface.</p>
    <p num="p-0074">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an exemplary staff data record according to an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. As shown, teacher and substitute information stored in a staff data record <b>90</b>, or data record <b>404</b>, can include: name <b>92</b>; title <b>94</b>; social security number <b>96</b>; a personal identification number (PIN) <b>98</b>; billing information for billing substitute fulfillment services involving that teacher <b>100</b>; certifications of the teacher <b>102</b>; a list of teachers preferred to substitute for the teacher, or, alternatively, a list of criteria for selecting an appropriate substitute for the teacher <b>104</b>; schedule information, preferably through a pop-up calendar <b>106</b>, including work duties and absence information <b>108</b> (primarily for teachers) and availability <b>126</b> (primarily for substitutes); flags for special conditions <b>122</b>, such as special instructions for a substitute or messages from a teacher to a substitute; affiliation information <b>112</b>; contact information for the teacher <b>116</b>; organization contact information for who to contact if that teacher calls in an absence or a substitute fulfillment is performed <b>118</b>; classroom location information <b>120</b>; entitlement balances <b>124</b>, for how many absences (sick days, personal days, etc.) a teacher has left for the school year; and call time preferences <b>128</b> (primarily for substitutes). The substitute schedule information is also stored in data record <b>403</b>. The entitlement types are stored in data record <b>402</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0075">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, exemplary business data for record-keeping, billing, and administrative functions according to an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. The database <b>14</b> can store a business data record <b>130</b> with fields such as: the billing address <b>132</b> of the customer organization, its mailing address <b>134</b>, billing contact <b>136</b>, emergency contacts <b>138</b>, phone numbers <b>140</b>, fax numbers <b>142</b>, electronic mail addresses <b>144</b>, and options selected <b>148</b>. It is understood that the fields shown are only representative of the fields that may be used within the scope of the present invention. Also, these fields may be further broken down into more specific subfields, for example, multiple mailing addresses or different emergency contacts for different times of day, week, month, or year. In this way, the system <b>10</b> maintains the information needed to perform substitute fulfillment, information compilation or notification for a particular organization. Other possible records are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-10</figref>, and include records for pick-list management <b>150</b>; for school data <b>166</b>; for county data <b>190</b>; for district data <b>202</b>; for client preferences <b>226</b>; and for reporting schemes <b>230</b>. The skills for each worker that may be used as a substitute or may require a substitute are recorded in data record <b>409</b>, while the worker's personal identification number for accessing the system <b>10</b> is stored in data record <b>410</b>. Data records <b>407</b> and <b>408</b> include the preferred skills of a potential substitute and the skills of the actual substitute who accepts the position, respectively. The records maintained in the main database of the system <b>10</b> are preferably stored on the database server <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0076">Substitute Worker Fulfillment</p>
    <p num="p-0077">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, an exemplary flowchart of a method for performing substitute fulfillment according to an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. At step <b>62</b>, the server <b>12</b> receives notification of an absentee. The notification can occur in several ways. In one embodiment, when a worker <b>30</b> covered by the system <b>10</b> becomes aware of an absence, the worker <b>30</b> contacts the server <b>12</b> by telephone, preferably through a toll-free number. Using keys on the standard telephone keypad, the worker <b>30</b> identifies himself or herself and enters the details of the pending absence. Alternatively, the worker <b>30</b> can contact a website hosted by the server <b>12</b> via the Internet <b>18</b>. In an alternate embodiment, the worker <b>30</b> can access a website hosted by the server <b>12</b> via a link on a website hosted on behalf of the worker's employer. The worker <b>30</b> can access the website using a personal computer, an Internet capable telephone, a personal data assistant, or any other device that provides access to the Internet. The information regarding the pending absence is stored in data record <b>401</b>. In addition to providing information regarding his upcoming absence, the worker <b>30</b> can also record or transmit a message directed to the substitute worker or substitute <b>32</b>. In one embodiment, if the worker <b>30</b> notifies the client organization, rather than the system <b>10</b>, of the absence directly, then the organization can either call in the absence as described above or can access the website as described above.</p>
    <p num="p-0078">Once the server <b>12</b> receives the notification of an absence, the server <b>12</b> records the absence in data record <b>401</b>. The skills required of a substitute are stored in data record <b>405</b>. The entitlement information regarding a pending absence is stored in data record <b>406</b>. The server operates in the states shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, including Initial (<b>281</b>), MainMenu (<b>282</b>), Whenstep<b>1</b> (<b>283</b>), WhenAnotherDay (<b>284</b>), Shift (<b>285</b>), StartTime (<b>286</b>), AbsenceType (<b>287</b>), RecordInstructions (<b>288</b>), ConfirmAbsence (<b>289</b>), CheckComplete (<b>290</b>), Entitlements (<b>291</b>), ErrorState (<b>292</b>), Hangup (<b>293</b>), and Goodbye (<b>294</b>), and the events which invoke these states are also described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>. For example, Generate Start Event signifies returning to the first action of the phone call, preferably to replay a greeting or a request for an identification number. MainMenu (<b>282</b>) prompts the worker to push 1 on the telephone if the worker desires to record an absence, 2 to listen to entitlement day balances, including but not limited to vacation, personal and sick days remaining, and 3 for special instructions regarding a particular workplace. In Shift (<b>285</b>), if the worker's absence will not begin at the start of the work shift, the system proceeds to StartTime (<b>286</b>), during which worker is prompted for the start time of the absence. The worker is prompted to designate an absence type, which types have been designated by the Client, in state <b>287</b>. In Entitlements (<b>291</b>), “List Entitlement Day Balances” signifies notifying the worker of entitlements, including but not limited to, used and remaining vacation, sick and personal days.</p>
    <p num="p-0079">At step <b>63</b>, the system <b>10</b> distributes absence notifications to relevant client personnel <b>28</b>. The absence notifications can be distributed on a regular basis at a time specified in advance by the client or on an event basis, e.g., upon each notification. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, an exemplary notification in the form of summary absence reports <b>276</b> is illustrated. The information for the absence reports is stored on data record <b>400</b>. For example, the server <b>12</b> can transmit a summary absence report <b>276</b> for each workday at 5:00 p.m. on the previous day and again at 7:00 a.m. that day to selected client personnel. The summary absence reports <b>276</b> can be distributed via facsimile, electronic mail, applet, or through the website to any parties designated by the client as “need-to-know” parties for all absences or for particular absences. Notification preferences are stored within the server <b>12</b>. In a preferred embodiment, designated client personnel receive both an absence notification via electronic mail as soon as the absence is registered and a summary absence report <b>276</b> via facsimile at a pre-set time. Use of multiple communications channels builds additional reliability into the system <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0080">At step <b>64</b>, the substitute fulfillment system <b>10</b> identifies potential substitutes <b>32</b> for the absent worker <b>30</b>. The organization typically has a pool of potential substitutes <b>32</b>. If the organization has chosen to identify particular substitutes <b>32</b> suitable for a particular worker <b>30</b>, then the substitute fulfillment system <b>10</b> accesses a list of the identified substitutes <b>32</b> which is used in the next step. Alternatively, if the organization has identified only qualifications or criteria for selecting an acceptable substitute <b>32</b> for a particular worker <b>30</b>, then the substitute fulfillment system <b>10</b> compiles a list of potential substitutes by searching for potential substitutes with the requisite qualifications in a master list of substitutes <b>32</b> available to the organization located in the database <b>14</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the substitute fulfillment system <b>10</b> compiles a list of preferred substitutes and a back-up list of acceptable substitutes.</p>
    <p num="p-0081">At step <b>65</b>, the system <b>10</b> contacts potential substitutes <b>32</b> via the telephone network using the IVR system <b>24</b>. The IVR system <b>24</b> interfaces logically with callers, usually employing a set of pre-recorded prompts, a database, and dynamic selection criteria. The number called, and the caller identification are recorded in data record <b>411</b>. The server operates during step <b>82</b> in the states including MakeTheCall (<b>308</b>), CallAnalysis (<b>309</b>), Identify (<b>310</b>), PresentRequest (<b>311</b>), RejectRequest (<b>312</b>), AcceptRequest (<b>313</b>), ErrorState (<b>314</b>), Goodbye (<b>315</b>), and Hangup (<b>316</b>) which are displayed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13D</figref>. The invoking events for each of these states are set forth in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13D</figref>, and examples of these events follow:</p>
    <p num="p-0082">In Identify (<b>310</b>), the potential substitute is prompted for an identification number. In PresentRequest (<b>311</b>), the request is played and the potential substitute is prompted for 1 to replay the request, 2 to accept and 3 to reject. Further, the potential substitute is prompted for 1 to reject future requests, or 2 to allow additional requests to be phoned to the potential substitute, in RejectRequest (<b>312</b>). If the potential substitute accepts the request, a confirmation number is played in AcceptRequest (<b>313</b>).</p>
    <p num="p-0083">At step <b>66</b>, the system <b>10</b> continues to contact the potential substitute workers listed on the generated list over a period of time until a substitute worker <b>32</b> accepts a position or until the generated list is exhausted. If multiple lists of potential substitutes have been compiled, the system <b>10</b> first searches the list of preferred substitutes before resorting to secondary lists. The client organization may specify appropriate call times and other parameters for the IVR system <b>24</b>. If a substitute worker <b>32</b> accepts the assignment, the server <b>12</b> can relay instructions from the organization or messages from the absent worker <b>30</b> to the substitute worker <b>32</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0084">At step <b>67</b>, the system <b>10</b> generates one or more reports and send the reports to organization personnel <b>28</b>, e.g., officials, designated for receipt of the reports. Clients may specify different personnel distribution lists for various reports. Reports may be mailed electronically or faxed, or both by server <b>12</b>. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, exemplary reports generated by the system according to an embodiment of the present invention. The system <b>10</b> generates summary absentee reports <b>276</b>, summary substitute assignment reports <b>278</b>, call history reports <b>279</b>, and unfulfilled substitute assignment reports <b>280</b> with the details of any successful substitute, all calls made, and information regarding any vacancy that could not be filled. The information for the reports is stored in data record <b>400</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0085">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, all desired transaction information, including all absence notifications, substitute requirements, substitute fulfillment attempts, substitute fulfillment successes and failures, web site accesses, employment searches by substitutes, etc., are stored in the database <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0086">List of Opportunities for Substitute Workers</p>
    <p num="p-0087">In a preferred embodiment, using the information in the database <b>14</b>, the server <b>12</b> can generate a listing of opportunities for substitute workers <b>32</b> and make the listing available through a web site interface. Substitute workers <b>32</b> can access the site and select an assignment. If the same assignment is currently being processed or waiting to be processed by the IVR system <b>24</b>, then the assignment selection is recognized, further processing is halted, and appropriate reports generated. Data record <b>400</b> stores the information for said reports.</p>
    <p num="p-0088">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, an exemplary flowchart for allowing substitute workers to secure a position via the Internet is illustrated. At step <b>70</b>, the server <b>12</b> receives notification of an absentee. Step <b>70</b> is equivalent to step <b>62</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0089">At step <b>71</b>, the system <b>10</b> generates a list of positions that need to be filled. The list can be generated on a periodic basis, e.g., at the same time everyday, or on an event basis, e.g. adding a new position upon the receipt of an absentee notification. In the preferred embodiment, positions that the organization has chosen to identify particular substitutes <b>32</b> suitable for a particular worker <b>30</b>, then the position is not listed unless the system <b>10</b> cannot secure an identified substitute <b>32</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0090">At step <b>72</b>, the system <b>10</b> posts or displays the list on a website hosted on the server <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0091">At step <b>73</b>, a response to the posted position is received by the system <b>10</b> via the Internet.</p>
    <p num="p-0092">At step <b>74</b>, the system <b>10</b> determines if the substitute worker <b>32</b> is qualified to fill-in for the absent worker <b>30</b>. The determination is made by comparing the qualifications of the potential substitute worker <b>32</b> with the qualifications or criteria for the position that are identified by the client organization. If the system <b>10</b> determines that the potential substitute worker <b>32</b> is qualified, then the system <b>10</b> secures the substitute worker <b>32</b> to cover for the absent worker <b>30</b>. If a substitute worker <b>32</b> accepts the assignment, the server <b>12</b> can relay instructions from the organization or messages from the absent worker <b>30</b> to the substitute worker <b>32</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0093">At step <b>75</b>, the system <b>10</b> notifies the client organization of the position fulfillment. This can be accomplished by generating one or more reports and sending the reports to organization personnel <b>28</b>, e.g., officials, designated for receipt of the reports. Client organizations can specify different personnel distribution lists for various reports. Reports may be mailed electronically, faxed, or both by server <b>12</b>. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, exemplary reports generated by the system according to an embodiment of the present invention. The system <b>10</b> generates summary absentee reports <b>276</b>, summary substitute assignment reports <b>278</b>, call history reports <b>279</b>, and unfulfilled substitute assignment reports <b>280</b> with the details of any successful substitute, all calls made, and information regarding any vacancy that could not be filled. The information for the reports is stored in data record <b>400</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0094">The server <b>12</b> is capable of handling multiple clients and multiple substitute fulfillment tasks simultaneously. The system <b>10</b> provides opportunities to match substitutes across organizations, to aggregate data and to review trends. In a preferred embodiment, the server <b>12</b> and database <b>14</b> track substitute fulfillment data globally, identify opportunities for inter-organization substitute referral or fulfillment, and report on substitute fulfillment needs and other trends. The report information is stored in data record <b>400</b>. For example, the server <b>12</b> may identify substitute teachers registered in a district adjacent to a customer school district and inform the customer school district. In another example, the substitute fulfillment system may identify hot spots where substitutes with particular qualifications are in demand.</p>
    <p num="p-0095">Notification System of an Unexpected Absence</p>
    <p num="p-0096">In a preferred embodiment, the system <b>10</b> can notify designated groups of people of an absence over the telephone. The client in this embodiment is an organization including but not limited to school or business entity. The data records may contain information related to contact information for each student in the school's body or each worker, including but not limited to, phone numbers and email addresses of parent's and guardian's, student's classes, and student's year.</p>
    <p num="p-0097">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, an exemplary flowchart for notifying a designated group of an unexpected absence according to an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. At step <b>76</b>, the system receives a notification of an unexpected absence via a phone call or email. Information regarding the call, including the number called is stored at data record <b>411</b>. At step <b>76</b>, the server <b>12</b> transitions between the states shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref>, which included RecordFilesMenu (<b>303</b>), RecordFiles (<b>304</b>), ErrorState (<b>305</b>), Goodbye (<b>306</b>) and Hangup (<b>307</b>). These states are invoked by the events set fourth in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref> and several example events follow. The caller is prompted for the recording ID, in order to prevent an unauthorized recording in RecordFilesMenu (<b>303</b>). In RecordFiles (<b>304</b>), if the caller presses 1 on the telephone, the system <b>10</b> prompts the caller to record a new recording or to verify that the existing recording is acceptable.</p>
    <p num="p-0098">At step <b>77</b>, the system <b>10</b> distributes notifications of absence to interested parties, including but not limited to, administrators or managers. These notifications may be in the form of summary absence reports distributed by facsimile, electronic mail, or via telephone to any parties designated by the client as a contact person for all absences or for particular absences, including absences for a particular class year.</p>
    <p num="p-0099">At step <b>78</b>, the system <b>10</b> contacts each persons listed in the contact information (“contacts”) for each absent student or worker, including but not limited to parents and guardians, preferably via the IVR system <b>25</b> and telephone network <b>16</b>. The system <b>10</b> calls the contacts in order to receive an acknowledgement that the student or worker is absent for an acceptable reason.</p>
    <p num="p-0100">At step <b>79</b>, the system <b>10</b> continues to call particular contacts for the student or worker until the list is exhausted. If the list is not exhausted, the system <b>10</b> continues to call the next contact on the list.</p>
    <p num="p-0101">At step <b>80</b>, the system <b>10</b> generates and distributes a report of unacknowledged absences from the server to designated personnel in the client organization.</p>
    <p num="p-0102">Notification System of an Unexpected Event</p>
    <p num="p-0103">In another preferred embodiment, the invention may be used to notify designated groups of people over the telephone of an unexpected event. The client in this embodiment includes but is not limited to a school, school district, or business entity. The data records, in a preferred embodiment, contain information related to contact information for each student or worker of the client's, including but not limited to, phone numbers for workers, parents, and guardians, email addresses, student's classes, student's grade, and the content of the message representing the unexpected event.</p>
    <p num="p-0104">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> again, an exemplary flowchart for notifying a designated group of an unexpected event according to an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. At step <b>76</b>, the system <b>10</b> receives a phone call or email regarding an unexpected event or announcement of the client, and records a new message regarding the unexpected event or announcement. The server <b>12</b> then operates in and transitions between the states shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, which include MainMenu (<b>295</b>), RecordSchoolMenu (<b>296</b>), RecordSchool (<b>297</b>), Record EntTypesMenu (<b>298</b>), RecordEntTypes (<b>299</b>), ErrorState (<b>300</b>), Goodbye (<b>301</b>), and Hangup (<b>302</b>). The events which invoke and transition between these states are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0105">At step <b>78</b>, the server <b>12</b> then contacts the persons listed in the contact information for each affected student or worker, including but not limited to parents and guardians, preferably using the IVR system <b>25</b> and telephone network <b>16</b> to notify the contacts of the event or announcement. At step <b>79</b>, the system <b>10</b> continues to call particular contacts for the student or worker until the list is exhausted. If the list is not exhausted, the system <b>10</b> continues to call the next contact on the list. At step <b>80</b>, the system <b>10</b> generates and distributes a report of unacknowledged event announcements from the server to designated personnel in the client organization. The report can be distributed via facsimile, electronic mail, or via an applet to any parties designated by the client as a contact person for all events or for particular events. All information for the reports is stored in data record <b>400</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0106">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, an exemplary flowchart for allowing a substitute worker to secure a position via an instant messaging system according to an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. At step <b>81</b>, a substitute worker <b>32</b> downloads an instant messaging (IM) applet from the server <b>12</b> over a communication network <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> where the applet is installed onto a computing device. Examples of IM applets include, but are not limited to, AOL IM, MSN IM, ICQ IM, and any other instant messaging applets.</p>
    <p num="p-0107">At step <b>82</b>, the system <b>10</b> generates a list of positions that need to be filled in response to the substitute worker <b>32</b> establishing a connection to the telephone network <b>16</b> or computer network <b>18</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the list of positions is a list of positions that need to be filled in which the substitute worker <b>32</b> is qualified to fill. In a preferred embodiment, the list of positions is a list of positions that one or more organizations has chosen to identify the particular substitute worker <b>32</b> who established the connection.</p>
    <p num="p-0108">At step <b>83</b>, the system <b>10</b> posts or displays the list on the computing device of the substitute worker <b>32</b>. Using the IM applet, the substitute worker <b>32</b> can configure intervals over which an updated list of positions to be filled is retrieved and refreshed on the IM applet.</p>
    <p num="p-0109">At step <b>84</b>, a response to the posted position is received by the system <b>10</b> via the IM applet. Thus, the substitute worker <b>32</b> is able to interact with the system <b>10</b> without accessing the website.</p>
    <p num="p-0110">At step <b>85</b>, the system <b>10</b> determines if the substitute worker <b>32</b> is qualified to fill-in for the absent worker <b>30</b>. The determination is made by comparing the qualifications of the potential substitute worker <b>32</b> with the qualifications or criteria for the position that are identified by the client organization. If the system <b>10</b> determines that the potential substitute worker <b>32</b> is qualified, then the system <b>10</b> secures the substitute worker <b>32</b> to cover for the absent worker <b>30</b>. If a substitute worker <b>32</b> accepts the assignment, the server <b>12</b> can relay instructions from the organization or messages from the absent worker <b>30</b> to the substitute worker <b>32</b> via the IM applet. In a preferred embodiment, the substitute worker <b>32</b> can participate in an interactive online message interaction, commonly known as an “online chat” with either an official <b>28</b> from the client organization or the worker <b>30</b> the substitute worker <b>32</b> is temporarily replacing. In addition, the substitute worker <b>32</b> can receive a stored message or messages from the client organization or the worker <b>30</b> the substitute worker <b>32</b> is temporarily replacing.</p>
    <p num="p-0111">At step <b>86</b>, the system <b>10</b> notifies the client organization of the position fulfillment. This can be accomplished by generating one or more reports and sending the reports to organization personnel <b>28</b>, e.g., officials, designated for receipt of the reports. Client organizations can specify different personnel distribution lists for various reports. Reports may be mailed electronically or faxed, or both by server <b>12</b>. Refer ring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, exemplary reports generated by the system according to an embodiment of the present invention. The system <b>10</b> generates summary absentee reports <b>276</b>, summary substitute assignment reports <b>278</b>, call history reports <b>279</b>, and unfulfilled substitute assignment reports <b>280</b> with the details of any successful substitute, all calls made, and information regarding any vacancy that could not be filled.
