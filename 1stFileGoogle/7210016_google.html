<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading> <p num="p-0003">The invention relates generally to information storage and retrieval and, more specifically, to coordinating memory components.</p>
  <heading>BACKGROUND</heading> <p num="p-0004">As computers and data processing equipment have grown in capability, users have developed applications that place increasing demands on the equipment. Thus, there is a continually increasing need to process more information in a given amount of time. One way to process more information in a given amount of time is to process each element of information in a shorter amount of time. As that amount of time is shortened, it approaches the physical speed limits that govern the communication of electronic signals. While it would be ideal to be able to move electronic representations of information with no delay, such delay is unavoidable. In fact, not only is the delay unavoidable, but, since the amount of delay is a function of distance, the delay varies according to the relative locations of the devices in communication.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">Since there are limits to the capabilities of a single electronic device, it is often desirable to combine many devices, such as memory components, to function together to increase the overall capacity of a system. However, since the devices cannot all exist at the same point in space simultaneously, consideration must be given to operation of the system with the devices located diversely over some area.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">Traditionally, the timing of the devices' operation was not accelerated to the point where the variation of the location of the devices was problematic to their operation. However, as performance demands have increased, traditional timing paradigms have imposed barriers to progress.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">One example of an existing memory system uses DDR (double data rate) memory components. The memory system includes a memory controller and a memory module. A propagation delay occurs along an address bus between the memory controller and the memory module. Another propagation delay occurs along the data bus between the memory controller and the memory module.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">The distribution of the control signals and a control clock signal in the memory module is subject to strict constraints. Typically, the control wires are routed so there is an equal length to each memory component. A “star” or “binary tree” topology is typically used, where each spoke of the star or each branch of the binary tree is of equal length. The intent is to eliminate any variation of the timing of the control signals and the control clock signal between different memory components of a memory module, but the balancing of the length of the wires to each memory component compromises system performance (some paths are longer than they need to be). Moreover, the need to route wires to provide equal lengths limits the number of memory components and complicates their connections.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">In such DDR systems, a data strobe signal is used to control timing of both data read and data write operations. The data strobe signal is not a periodic timing signal, but is instead only asserted when data is being transferred. The timing signal for the control signals is a periodic clock. The data strobe signal for the write data is aligned to the clock for the control signals. The strobe for the read data is delayed by delay relative to the control clock equal to the propagation delay along the address bus plus the propagation delay along the data bus. A pause in signaling must be provided when a read transfer is followed by a write transfer to prevent interference along various signal lines used. Such a pause reduces system performance.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">Such a system is constrained in several ways. First, because the control wires have a star topology or a binary tree routing, reflections occur at the stubs (at the ends of the spokes or branches). The reflections increase the settling time of the signals and limit the transfer bandwidth of the control wires. Consequently, the time interval during which a piece of information is driven on a control wire will be longer than the time it takes a signal wavefront to propagate from one end of the control wire to the other. Additionally, as more modules are added to the system, more wire stubs are added to each conductor of the data bus, thereby adding reflections from the stubs. This increases the settling time of the signals and further limits the transfer bandwidth of the data bus.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">Also, because there is a constraint on the relationship between the propagation delays along the address bus and the data bus in this system, it is hard to increase the operating frequency without violating a timing parameter of the memory component. If a clock signal is independent of another clock signal, those clock signals and components to which they relate are considered to be in different clock domains. Within a memory component, the write data receiver is operating in a different clock domain from the rest of the logic of the memory component, and the domain crossing circuitry will only accommodate a limited amount of skew between these two domains. Increasing the signaling rate of data will reduce this skew parameter (when measured in time units) and increase the chance that a routing mismatch between data and control wires on the board will create a timing violation.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">Also, most DDR systems have strict limits on how large the address bus and data bus propagation delays may be (in time units). These are limits imposed by the memory controller and the logic that is typically included for crossing from the controller's read data receiver clock domain into the clock domain used by the rest of the controller. There is also usually a limit (expressed in clock cycles) on how large the sum of these propagation delays can be. If the motherboard layout makes this sum too large (when measured in time units), the signal rate of the system may have to be lowered, thereby decreasing performance.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">In another example of an existing memory system, the control wires and data bus are connected to a memory controller and are routed together past memory components on each memory module. One clock is used to control the timing of write data and control signals, while another clock is used to control the timing of read data. The two clocks are aligned at the memory controller. Unlike the previous prior art example, these two timing signals are carried on separate wires.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">In such an alternate system, several sets of control wires and a data bus may be used to intercouple the memory controller to one or more of the memory components. The need for separate sets of control wires introduces additional cost and complexity, which is undesireable. Also, if a large capacity memory system is needed, the number of memory components on each data bus will be relatively large. This will tend to limit the maximum signal rate on the data bus, thereby limiting performance.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">Thus, a technique is needed to coordinate memory operations among diversely-located memory components.</p>

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading> <p num="p-0051">A method and apparatus for coordinating memory operations among diversely-located memory components is described. In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, wave-pipelining is implemented for an address bus coupled to a plurality of memory components. The plurality of memory components are configured according to coordinates relating to the address bus propagation delay and the data bus propagation delay. A timing signal associated with address and/or control signals which duplicates the propagation delay of these signals is used to coordinate memory operations. The address bus propagation delay, or common address bus propagation delay, refers to the delay for a signal to travel along an address bus between the memory controller component and a memory component. The data bus propagation delay refers to the delay for a signal to travel along a data bus between the memory controller component and a memory component.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">According to one embodiment of the invention, a memory system includes multiple memory modules providing multiple ranks and multiple slices of memory components. Such a system can be understood with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. The memory system of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> includes memory module <b>2703</b> and memory module <b>2730</b>. Memory module <b>2703</b> includes a rank that includes memory components <b>2716</b>–<b>2618</b> and another rank that includes memory components <b>2744</b>–<b>2746</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0053">The memory system is organized into slices across the memory controller component and the memory modules. The memory system of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> includes a slice <b>2713</b> that includes a portion of memory controller <b>2702</b>, a portion of memory module <b>2703</b> including memory components <b>2716</b> and <b>2744</b>, and a portion of memory module <b>2730</b> including memory components <b>2731</b> and <b>2734</b>. The memory system of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> includes another slice <b>2714</b> that includes another portion of memory controller <b>2702</b>, another portion of memory module <b>2703</b> including memory components <b>2717</b> and <b>2745</b>, and another portion of memory module <b>2730</b> including memory components <b>2732</b> and <b>2735</b>. The memory system of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> further includes yet another slice <b>2715</b> that includes yet another portion of memory controller <b>2702</b>, yet another portion of memory module <b>2703</b> including memory components <b>2718</b> and <b>2746</b>, and yet another portion of memory module <b>2730</b> including memory components <b>2733</b> and <b>2736</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">The use of multiple slices and ranks, which may be implemented using multiple modules, allows efficient interconnection of a memory controller and several memory components while avoiding degradation of performance that can occur when a data bus or address bus has a large number of connections to it. With a separate data bus provided for each slice, the number of connections to each data bus can be kept to a reasonable number. The separate data buses can carry different signals independently of each other. A slice can include one or more memory components per module. For example, a slice can include one memory component of each rank. Note that the term slice may be used to refer to the portion of a slice excluding the memory controller. In this manner, the memory controller can be viewed as being coupled to the slices. The use of multiple modules allows memory components to be organized according to their path lengths to a memory controller. Even slight differences in such path lengths can be managed according to the organization of the memory components into ranks. The organization of memory components according to ranks and modules allows address and control signals to be distributed efficiently, for example through the sharing of an address bus within a rank or module.</p>
  <p num="p-0055">In one embodiment, a slice can be understood to include several elements coupled to a data bus. As one example, these elements can include a portion of a memory controller component, one or more memory components on one module, and, optionally, one or more memory components on another module. In one embodiment, a rank can be understood to include several memory components coupled by a common address bus. The common address bus may optionally be coupled to multiple ranks on the module or to multiple modules. The common address bus can connect a memory controller component to each of the slices of a rank in succession, thereby allowing the common address bus to be routed from a first slice of the rank to a second slice of the rank and from the second slice of the rank to a third slice of the rank. Such a configuration can simplify the routing of the common address bus.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">For discussion purposes, a simplified form of a memory system is first discussed in order to illustrate certain concepts, whereas a more complex memory system that includes a plurality of modules and ranks is discussed later in the specification.</p>
  <p num="p-0057"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a memory system having a single rank of memory components with which an embodiment of the invention may be implemented. Memory system <b>101</b> comprises memory controller component <b>102</b> and memory module <b>103</b>. Address clock <b>104</b> provides an address clock signal that serves as a timing signal associated with the address and control signals that propagate along address bus <b>107</b>. Address clock <b>104</b> provides its address clock signal along address clock conductor <b>109</b>, which is coupled to memory controller component <b>102</b> and to memory module <b>103</b>. The address and control signals are sometimes referred to as simply the address signals or the address bus. However, since control signals may routed according to a topology common to address signals, these terms, when used, should be understood to include address signals and/or control signals.</p>
  <p num="p-0058">Write clock <b>105</b> provides a write clock signal that serves as a timing signal associated with the data signals that propagate along data bus <b>108</b> during write operations. Write clock <b>105</b> provides its write clock signal along write clock conductor <b>110</b>, which is coupled to memory controller component <b>102</b> and memory module <b>103</b>. Read clock <b>106</b> provides a read clock signal that serves as a timing signal associated with the data signals that propagate along data bus <b>108</b> during read operations. Read clock <b>106</b> provides its read clock signal along read clock conductor <b>111</b>, which is coupled to memory controller component <b>102</b> and memory module <b>103</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">Termination component <b>120</b> is coupled to data bus <b>108</b> near memory controller component <b>102</b>. As one example, termination component <b>120</b> may be incorporated into memory controller component <b>102</b>. Termination component <b>121</b> is coupled to data bus <b>108</b> near memory module <b>103</b>. Termination component <b>121</b> is preferably incorporated into memory module <b>103</b>. Termination component <b>123</b> is coupled to write clock conductor <b>110</b> near memory component <b>116</b> of memory module <b>103</b>. Termination component <b>123</b> is preferably incorporated into memory module <b>103</b>. Termination component <b>124</b> is coupled to read clock conductor <b>111</b> near memory controller component <b>102</b>. As an example, termination component <b>124</b> may be incorporated into memory controller component <b>102</b>. Termination component <b>125</b> is coupled to read clock conductor <b>111</b> near memory component <b>116</b> of memory module <b>103</b>. Termination component <b>125</b> is preferably incorporated into memory module <b>103</b>. The termination components may utilize active devices (e.g., transistors or other semiconductor devices) or passive devices (e.g. resistors, capacitors, or inductors). The termination components may utilize an open connection. The termination components may be incorporated in one or more memory controller components or in one or more memory components, or they may be separate components on a module or on a main circuit board.</p>
  <p num="p-0060">Memory module <b>103</b> includes a rank <b>112</b> of memory components <b>116</b>, <b>117</b>, and <b>118</b>. The memory module <b>103</b> is organized so that each memory component corresponds to one slice. Memory component <b>116</b> corresponds to slice <b>113</b>, memory component <b>117</b> corresponds to slice <b>114</b>, and memory component <b>118</b> corresponds to slice <b>115</b>. Although not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the specific circuitry associated with the data bus, write clock and associated conductors, and read clock and associated conductors that are illustrated for slice <b>113</b> is replicated for each of the other slices <b>114</b> and <b>115</b>. Thus, although such circuitry has not been illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for simplicity, it is understood that such dedicated circuitry on a slice-by-slice basis is preferably included in the memory system shown.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">Within memory module <b>103</b>, address bus <b>107</b> is coupled to each of memory components <b>116</b>, <b>117</b>, and <b>118</b>. Address clock conductor <b>109</b> is coupled to each of memory components <b>116</b>, <b>117</b>, and <b>118</b>. At the terminus of address bus <b>107</b> within memory module <b>103</b>, termination component <b>119</b> is coupled to address bus <b>107</b>. At the terminus of address clock conductor <b>109</b>, termination component <b>122</b> is coupled to address clock conductor <b>109</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0062">In the memory system of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each data signal conductor connects one controller data bus node to one memory device data bus node. However, it is possible for each control and address signal conductor to connect one controller address/control bus node to an address/control bus node on each memory component of the memory rank. This is possible for several reasons. First, the control and address signal conductors pass unidirectional signals (the signal wavefront propagates from the controller to the memory devices). It is easier to maintain good signal integrity on a unidirectional signal conductor than on a bidirectional signal conductor (like a data signal conductor). Second, the address and control signals contain the same information for all memory devices. The data signals will be different for all memory devices. Note that there might be some control signals (such as write enable signals) which are different for each memory device—these are treated as unidirectional data signals, and are considered to be part of the data bus for the purposes of this distinction. For example, in some instances, the data bus may include data lines corresponding to a large number of bits, whereas in some applications only a portion of the bits carried by the data bus may be written into the memory for a particular memory operation. For example, a 16-bit data bus may include two bytes of data where during a particular memory operation only one of the two bytes is to be written to a particular memory device. In such an example, additional control signals may be provided along a similar path as that taken by the data signals such that these control signals, which control whether or not the data on the data bit lines is written, traverse the system along a path with a delay generally matched to that of the data such that the control signals use in controlling the writing of the data is aptly timed. Third, routing the address and control signals to all the memory devices saves pins on the controller and memory module interface.</p>
  <p num="p-0063">As a result, the control and address signals will be propagated on wires that will be longer than the wires used to propagate the data signals. This enables the data signals to use a higher signaling rate than the control and address signals in some cases.</p>
  <p num="p-0064">To avoid impairment of the performance of the memory system, the address and control signals may be wave-pipelined in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The memory system is configured to meet several conditions conducive to wave-pipelining. First, two or more memory components are organized as a rank. Second, some or all address and control signals are common to all memory components of the rank. Third, the common address and control signals propagate with low distortion (e.g. controlled impedance). Fourth, the common address and control signals propagate with low intersymbol-interference (e.g. single or double termination).</p>
  <p num="p-0065">Wave-pipelining occurs when Tbit&lt;Twire, where the timing parameter Twire is defined to be the time delay for a wavefront produced at the controller to propagate to the termination component at the end of the wire carrying the signal, and the timing parameter Tbit is defined to be the time interval between successive pieces (bits) of information on the wire. Such pieces of information may represent individual bits or multiple bits encoded for simultaneous transmission. Wave-pipelined signals on wires are incident-wave sampled by receivers attached to the wire. This means that sampling will generally take place before the wavefront has reflected from the end of the transmission line (e.g., the wire).</p>
  <p num="p-0066">It is possible to extend the applicability of the invention from a single rank to multiple ranks of memory components in several ways. First, multiple ranks of memory components may be implemented on a memory module. Second, multiple memory modules may be implemented in a memory system. Third, data signal conductors may be dedicated, shared, or “chained” to each module. Chaining involves allowing a bus to pass through one module, connecting with the appropriate circuits on that module, whereas when it exits that particular module it may then enter another module or reach termination. Examples of such chaining of conductors are provided and described in additional detail in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29</figref>, <b>32</b>, and <b>35</b> below. Fourth, common control and address signal conductors may be dedicated, shared, or chained to each module. Fifth, data signal conductors may be terminated transmission lines or terminated stubs on each module. For this discussion, transmission lines are understood to represent signal lines that have sufficient lengths such that reflections and other transmission line characteristics must be considered and accounted for in order to assure proper signal transmission over the transmission lines. In contrast, terminated stubs are understood to be of such limited length that the parasitic reflections and other transmission line characteristics associated with such stubs can generally be ignored. Sixth, common control and address signal conductors may be terminated transmission lines or terminated stubs on each module. Permitting the shared address and control signals to be wave-pipelined allows their signaling rate to be increased, thereby increasing the performance of the memory system.</p>

The memory controller component <b>102</b> includes address transmit block <b>201</b>, which is coupled to address bus <b>107</b> and address clock conductor <b>109</b>. The memory controller component <b>102</b> also includes, on a per-slice basis, data transmit block <b>202</b> and data receive block <b>203</b>, which are coupled to data bus <b>108</b>.

  <p num="p-0068">Within each memory component, such as memory component <b>116</b>, an address receive block <b>204</b>, a data receive block <b>205</b>, and a data transmit block <b>206</b> are provided. The address receive block <b>204</b> is coupled to address bus <b>107</b> and address clock conductor <b>109</b>.

  <p num="p-0070">The basic topology represented in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> has several attributes. It includes a memory controller. It includes a single memory module. It includes a single rank of memory components. It includes a sliced data bus (DQ), with each slice of wires connecting the controller to a memory component. It includes a common address and control bus (Addr/Ctrl or AC) connecting the controller to all the memory components. Source synchronous clock signals flow with data, control, and address signals. Control and address signals are unidirectional and flow from controller to memory components. Data signals are bi-directional and may flow from controller to memory components (write operation) or may flow from memory components to controller (read operation). There may be some control signals with the same topology as data signals, but which flow only from controller to memory components. Such signals may be used for masking write data in write operations, for example. These may be treated as unidirectional data signals for the purpose of this discussion. The data, address, control, and clock wires propagate with low distortion (e.g., along controlled impedance conductors). The data, address, control, and clock wires propagate with low inter-symbol interference (e.g., there is a single termination on unidirectional signals and double termination on bi-directional signals). These attributes are listed to maintain clarity. It should be understood that the invention is not constrained to be practiced with these attributes and may be practiced so as to include other system topologies.</p>
  <p num="p-0071">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is a two dimensional coordinate system based on the slice number of the data buses and the memory components (S={0,1, . . . N<sub>S</sub>}) and the module number (M={0,1}). Here a slice number of “0’ and a module number of ‘0’ refer to the controller. This coordinate system allows signals to be named at different positions on a wire. This coordinate system will also allow expansion to topologies with more than one memory rank or memory module.</p>
  <p num="p-0072"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also shows the three clock sources (address clock <b>104</b>, which generates the AClk signal, write clock <b>105</b>, which generates the WClk signal, and read clock <b>106</b>, which generates the RClk signal) which generate the clocking reference signals for the three types of information transfer. These clock sources each drive a clock wire that is parallel to the signal bus with which it is associated. Preferably, the positioning of the clock sources within the system is such that the physical position on the clock line at which the clock source drives the corresponding clock signal is proximal to the related driving point for the bus line such that the propagation of the clock for a particular bus generally tracks the propagation of the related information on the associated bus. For example, the positioning of the address clock (AClk clock <b>104</b>) is preferably close to the physical position where the address signals are driven onto the address bus <b>107</b>. In such a configuration, the address clock will experience similar delays as it propagates throughout the circuit as those delays experienced by the address signals propagating along a bus that follows generally the same route as the address clock signal line.</p>
  <p num="p-0073">The clock signal for each bus is related to the maximum bit rate on the signals of the associated bus. This relationship is typically an integer or integer ratio. For example, the maximum data rate may be twice the frequency of the data clock signals. It is also possible that one or two of the clock sources may be “virtual” clock sources; the three clock sources will be in an integral-fraction-ratio (N/M) relationship with respect to one another, and any of them may be synthesized from either of the other two using phase-locked-loop (PLL) techniques to set the frequency and phase. Virtual clock sources represent a means by which the number of actual clock sources within the circuit can be minimized. For example, a WClk clock might be derived from an address clock (AClk) that is received by a memory device such that the memory device is not required to actually receive a WClk clock from an external source. Thus, although the memory device does not actually receive a unique, individually-generated WClk clock, the WClk clock generated from the AClk clock is functionally equivalent. The phase of a synthesized clock signal will be adjusted so it is the same as if it were generated by a clock source in the positions shown.</p>
  <p num="p-0074">Any of the clock signals shown may alternatively be a non-periodic signal (a strobe control signal, for example) which is asserted only when information is present on the associated bus. As was described above with respect to clock sources, the non-periodic signal sources are preferably positioned, in a physical sense, proximal to the appropriate buses to which they correspond such that propagation delays associated with the non-periodic signals generally match those propagation delays of the signals on the buses to which they correspond.</p>
  <p num="p-0075"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a timing diagram illustrating address and control timing notations used in timing diagrams of other Figures. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a rising edge <b>302</b> of the AClk signal <b>301</b> occurs at a time <b>307</b> during transmission of address information ACa <b>305</b>. A rising edge <b>303</b> of the AClk signal occurs at a time <b>308</b> during transmission of address information ACb <b>306</b>. Time <b>308</b> occurs at a time t<sub>CC </sub>before the time <b>309</b> of the next rising edge <b>304</b> of AClk signal <b>301</b>. The time tCC represents a cycle time of a clock circuit of a memory controller component. Dashed lines in the timing diagrams are used to depict temporal portions of a signal coincident with address information or datum information. For example, the AClk signal <b>301</b> includes a temporal portion corresponding to the presence of address information ACa <b>305</b> and another temporal portion corresponding to the presence of address information ACb <b>306</b>. Address information can be transmitted over an address bus as an address signal.</p>
  <p num="p-0076">If one bit per wire occurs per t<sub>CC</sub>, address bit <b>311</b> is transmitted during cycle <b>310</b>. If two bits per wire occur per t<sub>CC</sub>, address bits <b>313</b> and <b>314</b> are transmitted during cycle <b>312</b>. If four bits per wire occur per t<sub>CC</sub>, address bits <b>316</b>, <b>317</b>, <b>318</b>, and <b>319</b> are transmitted during cycle <b>315</b>. If eight bits per wire occur per t<sub>CC</sub>, address bits <b>321</b>, <b>322</b>, <b>323</b>, <b>324</b>, <b>325</b>, <b>326</b>, <b>327</b>, and <b>328</b> are transmitted during cycle <b>320</b>. Note that the drive and sample points for each bit window may be delayed or advanced by an offset (up to one bit time, which is t<sub>CC</sub>/N<sub>AC</sub>), depending upon the driver and sampler circuit techniques used. The parameters N<sub>AC </sub>and N<sub>DQ </sub>represent the number of bits per t<sub>CC </sub>for the address/control and data wires, respectively. In one embodiment, a fixed offset is used. An offset between the drive/sample points and the bit windows should be consistent between the driving component and the sampling component. It is preferable that in a particular system, any offset associated with the drive point for a bus is consistent throughout the entire system. Similarly, any understood sampling offset with respect to the bus should also be consistent. For example, if data is expected to be driven at a point generally corresponding to a rising edge of a related clock signal for one data bus line, that understood offset (or lack thereof) is preferably consistently used for all data lines. Note that the offset associated with driving data onto the bus may be completely different than that associated with sampling data carried by the bus. Thus, continuing with the example above, the sample point for data driven generally coincident with a rising edge may be 180 degrees out of phase with respect to the rising edge such that the valid window of the data is better targeted by the sample point.</p>
  <p num="p-0077"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a timing diagram illustrating data timing notations used in timing diagrams of other Figures. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a rising edge <b>402</b> of the WClk signal <b>401</b> occurs at a time <b>407</b> during transmission of write datum information Da <b>405</b>. A rising edge <b>403</b> of the WClk signal <b>401</b> occurs at a time <b>408</b>. A rising edge <b>404</b> of the WClk signal <b>401</b> occurs at a time <b>409</b> during transmission of read datum information Qb <b>406</b>. Time <b>407</b> is separated from time <b>408</b> by a time t<sub>CC</sub>, and time <b>408</b> is separated from time <b>409</b> by a time t<sub>CC</sub>. The time t<sub>CC </sub>represents the duration of a clock cycle. RClk signal <b>410</b> includes rising edge <b>411</b> and rising edge <b>412</b>. These rising edges may be used as references to clock cycles of RClk signal <b>410</b>. For example, transmission of write datum information Da <b>405</b> occurs during a clock cycle of RClk signal <b>410</b> that includes rising edge <b>411</b>, and transmission of read datum information Qb <b>406</b> occurs during a clock cycle of RClk signal <b>410</b> that includes rising edge <b>412</b>. As is apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, the clock cycle time associated with the address clock may differ from the clock cycle time associated with the read and/or write clocks.</p>
  <p num="p-0078">Write datum information is an element of information being written and can be transmitted over a data bus as a write data signal. Read datum information is an element of information being read and can be transmitted over a data bus as a read data signal. As can be seen, the notation Dx is used to represent write datum information x, while the notation Qy is used to represent read datum information y. Signals, whether address signals, write data signals, read data signals, or other signals can be applied to conductor or bus for a period of time referred to as an element time interval. Such an element time interval can be associated with an event occurring on a conductor or bus that carries a timing signal, where such an event may be referred to as a timing signal event. Examples of such a timing signal include a clock signal, a timing signal derived from another signal or element of information, and any other signal from which timing may be derived. In a memory access operation, the time from when an address signal begins to be applied to an address bus to when a data signal corresponding to that address signal begins to be applied to a data bus can be referred to as an access time interval.</p>

  <p num="p-0081">The column cycle time of the memory component represents the time interval required to perform successive column access operations (reads or writes). In the example shown, the AClk, RClk, and WClk clock signals are shown with a cycle time equal to the column cycle time. As is apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, the cycle time of the clock signals used in the system may be different from the column cycle time in other embodiments.</p>
  <p num="p-0082">Alternatively, any of the clocks could have a cycle time that is different than the column cycle time. The appropriate-speed clock for transmitting or receiving signals on a bus can always be synthesized from the clock that is distributed with the bus as long as there is an integer or integral-fraction-ratio between the distributed clock and the synthesized clock. As mentioned earlier, any of the required clocks can be synthesized from any of the distributed clocks from the other buses.</p>
  <p num="p-0083">This discussion will assume a single bit is sampled or driven on each wire during each t<sub>CC </sub>interval in order to keep the timing diagrams as simple as possible. However, the number of bits that are transmitted on each signal wire during each t<sub>CC </sub>interval can be varied. The parameters N<sub>AC </sub>and N<sub>DQ </sub>represent the number of bits per t<sub>CC </sub>for the address/control and data wires, respectively. The distributed or synthesized clock is multiplied up to create the appropriate clock edges for driving and sampling the multiple bits per t<sub>CC</sub>.

  <p num="p-0088">The clock signal AClk is shown with a cycle time that corresponds to the column cycle time. As previously mentioned, it could also have a shorter cycle time as long as the frequency and phase are constrained to allow the controller and memory components to generate the necessary timing points for sampling and driving the information on the bus. Likewise, the bus is shown with a single bit per wire transmitted per t<sub>CC </sub>interval. As previously mentioned, more than one bit could be transferred in each t<sub>CC </sub>interval since the controller and memory components are able to generate the necessary timing points for sampling and driving the information on the bus. Note that the actual drive point for the bus (the point at which data signals, address signals, and/or control signals are applied to the bus) may have an offset from what is shown (relative to the rising and falling edges of the clock)—this will depend upon the design of the transmit and receive circuits in the controller and memory components. In one embodiment, a fixed offset is used. An offset between the drive/sample points and the bit windows should be consistent between the driving component and the sampling component. As reiterated above, it is preferable that in a particular system, any offset associated with the drive point or sampling point for a bus is consistent throughout the entire system. It should be noted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is that there is a delay t<sub>PD0 </sub>in the clock AClk<sub>S,M </sub>and bus AC<sub>S,M </sub>as they propagate from the controller to the first slice.

  <p num="p-0095">It should be noted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is that there is a delay t<sub>PD2 </sub>in the clock WClk<sub>S,M </sub>and bus DQ<sub>S,M </sub>(with the write data) as they propagate from the controller to the slices of the first module. Thus, WClk clock signal <b>632</b> is shifted in time and space from WClk clock signal <b>601</b>. Also note that there is an approximately equal delay t<sub>PD2 </sub>in the clock RClk<sub>S,M </sub>and bus DQ<sub>S,M </sub>(with the read data) as they propagate from the slices of the first module to the controller. Thus, RClk clock signal <b>623</b> is shifted in time and space from RClk clock signal <b>654</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0096">As a result, the controller and the memory components must have their transmit logic coordinated so that they do not attempt to drive write data and read data at the same time. The example in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a sequence in which there are write-read-read-write-write transfers. It can be seen that read-read and write-write transfers may be made in successive t<sub>CC </sub>intervals, since the data in both intervals is traveling in the same direction. However, gaps (bubbles) are inserted at the write-read and read-write transitions so that a driver only turns on when the data driven in the previous interval is no longer on the bus (it has been absorbed by the termination components at either end of the bus wires).</p>
  <p num="p-0097">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the read clock RClk<sub>S,M </sub>and the write clock WClk<sub>S,M </sub>are in phase at each memory component (however the relative phase of these clocks at each memory component will be different from the other memory components—this will be shown later when the overall system timing is discussed). Note that this choice of phase matching is one of several possible alternatives that could have been used. Some of the other alternatives will be described later.</p>
  <p num="p-0098">As a result of matching the read and write clocks at each memory component (slice), the t<sub>CC </sub>intervals with read data Qb <b>650</b> will appear to immediately follow the t<sub>CC </sub>intervals with write data Da <b>649</b> at the memory components (bottom of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), but there will be a gap of 2*t<sub>PD2 </sub>between the read data interval Qb <b>619</b> and write data interval Da <b>618</b> at the controller (top of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). There will be a second gap of (2*t<sub>CC</sub>−2*t<sub>PD2</sub>) between the read data Qc <b>620</b> and the write data Dd <b>621</b> at the controller. There will be a gap of (2*t<sub>CC</sub>) between the read data Qc <b>651</b> and the write data Dd <b>621</b>. Note that the sum of the gaps at the memory components and the controller will be 2*t<sub>CC</sub>.</p>
  <p num="p-0099">The overall system timing will be described next. The example system phase aligns the AClk<sub>S,M</sub>, RClk<sub>S,M</sub>, and WClk<sub>S,M </sub>clocks at each memory component (the slice number varies from one through N<sub>S</sub>, and the module number is fixed at one). This has the benefit of allowing each memory component to operate in a single clock domain, avoiding any domain crossing issues. Because the address and control clock AClk<sub>S,M </sub>flows past each memory component, the clock domain of each memory slice will be offset slightly from the adjacent slices. The cost of this phasing decision is that the controller must adjust the read and write clocks for each slice to different phase values—this means there will be 1+(2*N<sub>s</sub>) clock domains in the controller, and crossing between these domains efficiently becomes very important. Other phase constraints are possible and will be discussed later.</p>
  <p num="p-0100"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a timing diagram illustrating system timing at a memory controller component in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. As before, the controller sends a write-read-read-write sequence of operations on the control and address bus AClk<sub>S0,M1</sub>. The Da write datum information is sent on the WClk<sub>S1,M0 </sub>and WClk<sub>SNs,M0 </sub>buses so that it will preferably arrive at the memory component of each slice one cycle after the address and control information ACa. This is done by making the phase of the WClk<sub>S1,M0 </sub>clock generally equivalent to (t<sub>PD0</sub>−t<sub>PD2</sub>) relative to the phase of the AClk<sub>S0,M1 </sub>clock (positive means later, negative means earlier). This will cause them to be in phase at the memory component of the first slice of the first module. Likewise, the phase of the WClk<sub>SNs,M0 </sub>clock is adjusted to be generally equivalent to (t<sub>PD0</sub>+t<sub>PD1</sub>−t<sub>PD2</sub>) relative to the phase of the AClk<sub>S0,M1 </sub>clock. Note that some tolerance is preferably built into the system such that the phase adjustment of the clock to approximate the propagation delays can vary slightly from the desired adjustment while still allowing for successful system operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0101">In a similar fashion, the phase of the RClk<sub>S1,M0 </sub>clock is adjusted to be generally equivalent to (t<sub>PD0</sub>+t<sub>PD2</sub>) relative to the phase of the AClk<sub>S0,M1 </sub>clock. This will cause them to be in phase at the memory component of the last slice of the first module. Likewise, the phase of the RClk<sub>SNs,M0 </sub>clock is adjusted according to the expression (t<sub>PD0</sub>+t<sub>PD1</sub>+t<sub>PD2</sub>) relative to the phase of the AClk<sub>S0,M1 </sub>clock to cause the RClk<sub>SNs,M0 </sub>clock and the AClk<sub>S0,M1 </sub>clock to be in phase at the memory component of the last slice of the first module.</p>

  <p num="p-0116"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 through 18</figref> illustrate the details of an exemplary system which uses address and data timing relationships which are nearly identical to what has been described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 through 9</figref>. In particular, all three clocks are in-phase on each memory component. This example system has several differences relative to this earlier description, however. First, two bits per wire are applied per t<sub>CC </sub>interval on the AC bus (address/control bus, or simply address bus). Second, eight bits per wire are applied per t<sub>CC </sub>interval on the DQ bus. Third, a clock signal accompanies the AC bus, but the read and write clocks for the DQ bus are synthesized from the clock for the AC bus.</p>
  <p num="p-0117"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a block diagram illustrating further details for one memory rank (one or more slices of memory components) of a memory system such as that illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The internal blocks of the memory components making up this rank are connected to the external AC or DQ buses. The serialized data on these external buses is converted to or from parallel form on internal buses which connect to the memory core (the arrays of storage cells used to hold information for the system). Note that <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows all 32 bits of the DQ bus connecting to the memory rank—these 32 bits are divided up into multiple, equal-sized slices and each slice of the bus is routed to one memory component. Thus, slices are defined based on portions of the DQ bus routed to separate memory components. The example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a memory component, or device, that supports the entire set of 32 data bits for a particular example system. In other embodiments, such a system may include two memory devices, where each memory device supports half of the 32 data bits. Thus, each of these memory devices would include the appropriate data transmit blocks,.data receive blocks, and apportionment of memory core such that they can individually support the portion of the overall data bus for which they are responsible. Note that the number of data bits need not be 32, but may be varied.</p>
  <p num="p-0118">The AClk signal is the clock which accompanies the AC bus. It is received and is used as a frequency and phase reference for all the clock signals generated by the memory component.

The frequency and phase adjustment is typically done with some type of phase-locked-loop (PLL) circuit, although other techniques are also possible. A variety of different suitable PLL circuits are well known in the art. The feedback loop includes the skew of the clock drivers needed to distribute the various clocks to the receive and transmit blocks as well as the memory core.

  <p num="p-0125">Address/control receive block <b>204</b> comprises registers <b>1101</b>, <b>1102</b>, and <b>1103</b>. Address bus conductor <b>1016</b> is coupled to registers <b>1101</b> and <b>1102</b>, which together form a shift register, and which are clocked by ClkM<b>2</b> clock signal <b>1025</b> and coupled to register <b>1103</b> via couplings <b>1104</b> and <b>1105</b>, respectively. Register <b>1103</b> is clocked by ClkM clock signal <b>1024</b> and provides address/control information to internal address bus <b>1027</b>. The representation of registers <b>1101</b> and <b>1102</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is preferably understood to imply that they form a shift register such that data entering register <b>1101</b> during one cycle is transferred into register <b>1102</b> during the subsequent cycle as new data enters register <b>1101</b>. In the particular embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the movement of data is controlled by the clock signal ClkM<b>2</b> <b>1025</b>. Thus, if clock ClkM<b>2</b> <b>1025</b> operates at twice the frequency of clock ClkM <b>1024</b>, the receive block <b>204</b> generally operates as a serial-to-parallel shift register, where two consecutive serial bits are grouped together in a two-bit parallel format before being output onto signal lines RAC <b>1027</b>.

  <p num="p-0128">Shown are the register elements needed to sample the address/control and write data, and to drive the read data. It is assumed in this example that two bits are transferred per address/control (AC[i]) wire in each t<sub>CC </sub>interval, and that eight bits are transferred per read data (Q[i]) wire or write data (D[i]) wire in each t<sub>CC </sub>interval. In addition to the primary clock ClkM (with a cycle time of t<sub>CC</sub>), there are two other aligned clocks that are generated. There is ClkM<b>2</b> (with a cycle time of t<sub>CC</sub>/2) and ClkM<b>8</b> (with a cycle time of t<sub>CC</sub>/8). These higher frequency clocks shift information in to or out from the memory component. Once in each t<sub>CC </sub>interval the serial data is transferred to or from a parallel register clocked by ClkM.</p>
  <p num="p-0129">Note that ClkM<b>2</b> and ClkM<b>8</b> clocks are frequency locked and phase locked to the ClkM clock. The exact phase alignment of the two higher frequency clocks will depend upon the circuit implementation of the driver and sampler logic. There may be small offsets to account for driver or sampler delay. There may also be small offsets to account for the exact position of the bit valid windows on the AC and DQ buses relative to the ClkM clock.</p>
  <p num="p-0130">Note also that in the memory component, the ClkM<b>2</b> or ClkM<b>8</b> clocks could be replaced by two or eight clocks each with a cycle time of t<sub>CC</sub>, but offset in phase in equal increments across the entire t<sub>CC </sub>interval. The serial register, which in transmit block <b>204</b> includes registers <b>1101</b>–<b>1102</b>, in transmit block <b>206</b> includes registers <b>1123</b>–<b>1130</b>, and in data receive block <b>205</b> includes registers <b>1106</b>–<b>1113</b>, would be replaced by a block of two or eight registers, each register loaded with a different clock signal so that the bit windows on the AC and DQ buses are properly sampled or driven. For example, in the transmit block <b>204</b>, two individual registers would be included, where one register is clocked by a first clock signal having a particular phase and the second register is clocked by a different clock signal having a different phase, where the phase relationship between these two clock signals is understood such that the equivalent serial-to-parallel conversion can be achieved as that described in detail above. Another possibility is to use level-sensitive storage elements (latches) instead of edge sensitive storage elements (registers) so that the rising and falling edges of a clock signal cause different storage elements to be loaded.</p>
  <p num="p-0131">Regardless of how the serialization is implemented, there are multiple bit windows per t<sub>CC </sub>interval on each wire, and multiple clock edges per t<sub>CC </sub>interval are created in the memory component in order to properly drive and sample these bit windows.</p>

  <p num="p-0140">In the embodiment shown, the ClkIn signal is the master clock for the whole memory subsystem. It is received and used as a frequency and phase reference for all the clock signals used by the controller. The other clocks are ClkC<b>2</b>, ClkC<b>8</b>, ClkC, and ClkCD. These are, respectively, 2×, 8×, 1×, and 1× the frequency of ClkIn. ClkC will have no phase offset relative to ClkIn, and ClkCD will be delayed by 90 degrees. ClkC<b>2</b> has every other rising edge aligned with a rising edge of ClkIn.</p>
  <p num="p-0141">Every eighth ClkC<b>8</b> rising edge is aligned with a rising edge of ClkIn except for an offset which compensates for the delay of a frequency divider and phase offset selector in the transmit and receive blocks.

  <p num="p-0142">The frequency and phase adjustment is typically done with some type of phase-locked-loop (PLL) circuit, although other techniques are also possible.

  <p num="p-0143"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a block diagram illustrating the logic used in the receive and transmit blocks of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Memory controller component <b>102</b> comprises address/control transmit blocks <b>201</b>, data transmit blocks <b>202</b>, and data receive blocks <b>203</b>. For clarity, the elements for only one bit are illustrated. It is understood that such elements may be replicated for each bit of the buses.</p>
  <p num="p-0144">Address/control transmit blocks <b>201</b> comprise register <b>1301</b> and registers <b>1302</b> and <b>1303</b>. Internal address bus <b>1231</b> is coupled to register <b>1301</b>, which is clocked by ClkC clock <b>1215</b> and provides outputs to registers <b>1302</b> and <b>1303</b> via couplings <b>1304</b> and <b>1305</b>, respectively. Registers <b>1302</b> and <b>1303</b> are clocked by ClkC<b>2</b> clock <b>1217</b> and provide output <b>1328</b> to the AC bus. As a result, the parallel information on the internal address bus <b>1231</b> is converted to serial form on the output <b>1228</b>. Additional functional description of the address/control transmit blocks <b>201</b> is provided with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> below.</p>
  <p num="p-0145">Generally, the data transmit blocks <b>202</b> and data receive blocks <b>203</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> serve the function of performing serial-to-parallel or parallel-to-serial conversion of data (the type of conversion depending upon the direction of the data flow). Such blocks are similar to those present within the memory devices, however in the case of the transmit and receive blocks included in the controller in this particular system, additional circuitry is required in order to obtain the appropriate clocking signals required to perform these serial-to-parallel and parallel-to-serial conversions. In the memory devices of this example, such clock adjustment circuitry is not required, as the clocks are understood to be phase aligned within the memory devices. However, within the controller such phase alignment cannot be guaranteed due to the assumption within the system that phase alignment within the memory devices will possibly cause phase mismatching in other portions of the system due to the physical positioning of the memory devices with respect to the controller. Thus, a memory device positioned a first distance from the controller will have a different set of characteristic delays with respect to signals communicated with the controller than a second memory device positioned at a second position. As such, individual clock adjustment circuitry would be required for such memory devices within the controller such that the controller is assured of properly capturing read data provided by each of the memory devices and to allow for the controller to properly drive write data intended to be received by each of the memory devices.</p>
  <p num="p-0146">Within the transmit block <b>202</b>, data for transmission is received over the TD bus <b>1232</b> in parallel format. This data is loaded into the register <b>1310</b> based on the clock ClkC signal <b>1215</b>. Once loaded in the register <b>1310</b>, the data is either directly passed through the multiplexer <b>1312</b> to the register <b>1313</b> or caused to be delayed by a half clock cycle by traversing the path through the multiplexer <b>1312</b> that includes the register <b>1311</b> which is clocked by the falling edge of the ClkC signal. Such circuitry enables the data on the TD bus, which is in the ClkC clock domain, to be successfully transferred into the clock domain needed for its transmission. This clock domain is the TClkC<b>1</b>B clock domain, which has the same frequency as the ClkC clock, but is not necessarily phase aligned to the ClkC clock signal. Similar circuitry is included within the receive block <b>203</b> such that data received in the RClkC<b>1</b>B clock domain can be successfully transferred onto the RQ bus that operates in the ClkC clock domain.</p>

Once in every t<sub>CC </sub>interval the serial data is transferred to or from a parallel register clocked by ClkC.</p>
  <p num="p-0152">Note that in the controller, the ClkC<b>2</b> or ClkC<b>8</b> clocks can be replaced by two or eight clocks each with a cycle time of t<sub>CC</sub>, but offset in phase in equal increments across the entire t<sub>CC </sub>interval. In such embodiments, the serial register is replaced by blocks of two or eight registers, where each register is loaded with a different clock signal so that the bit windows on the AC and DQ buses are properly sampled or driven. Another possibility is to use level-sensitive storage elements (latches) instead of edge sensitive storage elements (registers) so that the rising and falling edges of a clock signal cause different storage elements to be loaded.</p>
  <p num="p-0153">Regardless of how the serialization is implemented, there will be multiple bit windows per t<sub>CC </sub>interval on each wire, and many embodiments utilize multiple clock edges per t<sub>CC </sub>interval in the controller in order to properly drive and sample these bit windows.</p>
  <p num="p-0154"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> also shows how the controller deals with the fact that the read and write data that is received and transmitted for each slice is in a different clock domain. Since a slice may be as narrow as a single bit, there can be 32 read clock domains and 32 write clock domains simultaneously present in the controller (this example assumes a DQ bus width of 32 bits). Remember that in this example no clocks are transferred with the read and write data, and such clocks are preferably synthesized from a frequency source. The problem of multiple clock domains would still be present even if a clock was transferred with the read and write data. This is because the memory component is the point in the system where all local clocks are preferably in-phase. Other system clocking topologies are described later in this description.</p>
  <p num="p-0155">The transmit block for address/control bus (AC) in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> uses the ClkC<b>2</b> and ClkC clocks to perform two-to-one serialization. The ClkC<b>2</b> clock shifts the serial register <b>1302</b>, <b>1304</b> onto the AC wires <b>1328</b>. Note the exact phase alignment of the ClkC<b>2</b> clock depends upon the circuit implementation of the driver logic; there may be a small offset to account for driver delay. There may also be small offsets to account for the exact position of the bit drive window on the AC bus relative to the ClkC clock. For example, if the output drivers have a known delay, the phase of the ClkC<b>2</b> clock signal may be adjusted such that a portion of the output circuitry begins providing data to the output drivers slightly earlier than the time at which the data is to actually be driven onto an external signal line. The shifting of the phase of the ClkC<b>2</b> clock signal can thus be used to account for the inherent delay in the output driver such that data is actually presented on the external data line at the desired time. Similarly, adjustments to the phase of the ClkC<b>2</b> clock signal may also be used to ensure that the positioning of the valid data window for data driven based on the ClkC<b>2</b> clock signal is optimally placed.</p>
  <p num="p-0156">In a similar fashion, the transmit block for write data bus (D) in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> uses a phase-delayed ClkC<b>8</b> clock to perform eight-to-one serialization. The phase-delayed ClkC<b>8</b> clock shifts the serial register <b>1314</b> onto the DQ wires. Note the exact alignment of the phase-delayed ClkC<b>8</b> clock will depend upon the circuit implementation of the driver logic; there may be a small offset to account for driver delay. There may also be small offsets to account for the exact position of the bit drive window on the DQ bus.</p>
  <p num="p-0157">The TphShA[i][n:0] control signals <b>1236</b> select the appropriate phase offset relative to the input reference vectors ClkC<b>8</b>[N:1]. A phase offset selector may be implemented using a simple multiplexer, a more elaborate phase interpolator, or other phase offset selection techniques. In one example of a phase interpolator, a first reference vector of less-than-desired phase offset and a second reference vector of greater-than-desired phase offset are selected. A weighting value is applied to combine a portion of the first reference vector with a portion of the second reference vector to yield the desired output phase offset of the TClkC<b>8</b>A clock. Thus, the desired output phase offset of the TClkC<b>8</b>A clock is effectively interpolated from the first and second reference vectors. In one example of a phase multiplexer, the TphShA[i][n:0] control signals <b>1236</b> are used to select one of the ClkC<b>8</b>[N:1] clock signals <b>1219</b> to pass through to the TClkC<b>8</b>A clock (note that 2<sup>n+1</sup>=N). The phase that is used is, in general, different for each transmit slice on the controller. The phase for each slice on the controller is preferably selected during a calibration process during initialization. This process is described in detail later in this description.</p>
  <p num="p-0158">The TClkC<b>8</b>A clock passes through 1/8 <b>1325</b> and 1/1 <b>1324</b> frequency dividers before clocking the parallel <b>1313</b> and serial <b>1314</b> registers. Note that the ClkC<b>8</b>[N:1] signals that are distributed have a small phase offset to compensate for the delay of the phase offset selection block (PhShA) <b>1306</b> and the frequency divider blocks <b>1324</b> and <b>1325</b>. This offset is generated by a phase-locked-loop circuit and will track out supply voltage and temperature variations.</p>
  <p num="p-0159">Even with the transmit phase shift value set correctly (so that the bit windows on the D bus <b>1229</b> are driven properly), the phase of the TClkC<b>1</b>B clock used for the parallel register <b>1313</b> could be misaligned (there are eight possible combinations of phase). There are several ways of dealing with the problem. The scheme that is used in the embodiment illustrated provides an input TPhShB <b>1235</b>, such that when this input is pulsed, the phase of the TClkC<b>1</b>B clock will shift by ⅛<sup>th </sup>of a cycle (45 degrees). The initialization software adjusts the phase of this clock until the parallel register loads the serial register at the proper time. This initialization process is described in detail later in this description.</p>
  <p num="p-0160">Alternatively, it is also possible to perform the phase adjustment in the ClkC domain when preparing the TD bus <b>1232</b> for loading into the transmit block <b>202</b>. To do so, multiplexers and registers may be used to rotate the write data across ClkC cycle boundaries. A calibration process may be provided at initialization to accommodate the phase of the TClkC<b>1</b>B clock during which the transmit block <b>202</b> is powered up.</p>
  <p num="p-0161">After the phase shift controls are properly adjusted, the write data can be transmitted onto the D bus from the parallel register <b>1313</b>. However, the write data still needs to be transferred from the TD bus <b>1232</b> in the ClkC <b>1215</b> domain into the parallel register <b>1313</b> in the TClkC<b>1</b>B domain. This is accomplished with the skip multiplexer <b>1312</b>. The multiplexer selects between registers that are clocked on the rising <b>1310</b> and falling <b>1311</b> edges of ClkC. The SkipT value determines which of the multiplexer paths is selected. The SkipT value is determined by sampling the TClkC<b>1</b>B clock by the ClkCD clock <b>1222</b>. The resulting value is loaded into a register <b>1309</b> by the LoadSkip signal <b>1238</b> during the initialization routine. This circuitry is described in detail later in this description.</p>

  <p num="p-0165">Even with the receive phase shift value set correctly (so that the bit windows on the Q bus are sampled properly), the phase of the RClkC<b>1</b>B clock used for the parallel register <b>1320</b> could be mismatched (there are eight possible combinations of phase).

  <p num="p-0166">A skip multiplexer similar to that described for the transmit circuit is used to move between the RClkC<b>1</b>B clock domain and the ClkC clock domain.

  <p num="p-0167"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a logic diagram illustrating details of the PLL used to generate the ClkC<b>8</b> signal as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. PLL <b>1204</b> comprises PLL circuit <b>1401</b>, adjustable matched delays <b>1402</b>, matched buffers <b>1403</b>, and phase comparator <b>1404</b>. PLL circuit <b>1401</b> comprises VCO <b>1405</b>, dummy phase offset selector <b>1406</b>, frequency divider <b>1407</b>, and phase comparator <b>1408</b>. ClkIn clock signal <b>1201</b> is provided to VCO <b>1405</b> and phase comparator <b>1408</b>. VCO <b>1405</b> provides an output to adjustable matched delays <b>1402</b> and matched buffers <b>1403</b>. Adjustable matched delays <b>1402</b> provide a plurality of incrementally delayed outputs to matched buffers <b>1403</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0168">The PLL circuit <b>1401</b> generates a clock signal that is 8 times the frequency of the input clock signal ClkIn <b>1201</b>, and the generated signal is also phase-shifted to account for delay expected to exist in the paths of the clock signals produced by the circuit in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. As such, expected delays are compensated for during the clock generation process such that the clock signals that appear at the point of actual use are correctly phase adjusted. The remaining portion of the block <b>1204</b> outside of the PLL circuit <b>1401</b> is used to generate equally phase-spaced versions of the clock produced by the PLL circuit <b>1401</b>. This is accomplished through well-known delay locked loop techniques where the delay locked loop provides the mechanism for generating the equally spaced clock signals. The clock signals produced as a result of the block <b>1204</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> are provided to the phase shifting logic described below with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. The results of the clock generation performed by the circuits of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref> are used to perform the serial-to-parallel or parallel-to-serial conversion as described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> above.</p>
  <p num="p-0169">Output <b>1409</b> of matched buffers <b>1403</b>, which is not delayed by adjustable matched delays <b>1402</b>, is provided to an input of dummy phase offset selector <b>1406</b> and an input of phase comparator <b>1404</b> and provides the ClkC<b>8</b> clock signal. Delayed output <b>1410</b> provides the ClkC<b>8</b> <sub>1 </sub>clock signal. Delayed output <b>1411</b> provides the ClkC<b>8</b> <sub>2 </sub>clock signal. Delayed output <b>1412</b> provides the ClkC<b>8</b> <sub>3 </sub>clock signal. Delayed output <b>1413</b> provides the ClkC<b>8</b> <sub>N−1 </sub>clock signal. Delayed output <b>1414</b> provides the ClkC<b>8</b>N clock signal, which is provided to an input of phase comparator <b>1404</b>. Phase comparator <b>1404</b> provides a feedback signal to adjustable matched delays <b>1402</b>, thereby providing a delay-locked loop (DLL). Each of the matched buffers <b>1403</b> has a substantially similar propagation delay, thereby providing a buffered output without introducing unintended timing skew among output <b>1409</b> and delayed outputs <b>1410</b>–<b>1414</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0170">The ClkIn reference clock <b>1201</b> is received and is frequency-multiplied by 8× by the PLL <b>1204</b>. Several delays are included with the PLL feedback loop of PLL <b>1204</b>, including a buffer delay introduced by matched buffers <b>1403</b>, a dummy phase offset selection delay introduced by dummy phase offset selector <b>1406</b>, and a frequency divider delay introduced by frequency divider <b>1407</b>. By including these delays in the feedback loop, the clock that is used for sampling and driving bits on the DQ will be matched to the ClkIn reference, and any delay variations caused by slow drift of temperature and supply voltage will be tracked out.</p>
  <p num="p-0171">The output of the PLL circuit <b>1401</b> is then passed through a delay line <b>1402</b> with N taps. The delay of each element is identical, and can be adjusted over an appropriate range so that the total delay of N elements can equal one ClkC<b>8</b> cycle (t<sub>CC</sub>/8). There is a feedback loop <b>1404</b> that compares the phase of the undelayed ClkC<b>8</b> to the clock with maximum delay ClkC<b>8</b>[N]. The delay elements are adjusted until their signals are phase aligned, meaning there is t<sub>CC</sub>/8 of delay across the entire delay line.</p>
  <p num="p-0172">The ClkC<b>8</b>[N:1] signals pass through identical buffers <b>1403</b> and see identical loads from the transmit and receive slices to which they connect. The ClkC<b>8</b> reference signal <b>1409</b> also has a buffer and a matched dummy load to mimic the delay.</p>
  <p num="p-0173"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a block diagram illustrating how the ClkC<b>8</b>[N:1] signals are used in the transmit and receive blocks of the memory controller component such as that illustrated in FIG. <b>13</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. PhShA logic block <b>1501</b> comprises phase offset selection circuit <b>1502</b>, which comprises phase offset selector <b>1503</b>. Phase offset selector <b>1503</b> receives ClkC<b>8</b> <sub>1 </sub>clock signal <b>1410</b>, ClkC<b>8</b> <sub>2 </sub>clock signal <b>1411</b>, ClkC<b>8</b> <sub>3 </sub>clock signal <b>1412</b>, ClkC<b>8</b> <sub>N−1 </sub>clock signal <b>1413</b>, and ClkC<b>8</b> <sub>N </sub>clock signal <b>1414</b> (i.e., N variants of the ClkC<b>8</b> clock signal) and selects and provides ClkC<b>8</b>A clock signal <b>1504</b>. This is accomplished using the N-to-1 multiplexer <b>1503</b> which selects one of the signals depending upon the setting of the control signals PhShA[i][n:0], where N=2<sup>n+1</sup>. This allows the phase of the ClkC<b>8</b>A output clock for slice [i] to be varied across one ClkC<b>8</b> cycle (t<sub>CC</sub>/8) in increments of t<sub>CC</sub>/8N.</p>
  <p num="p-0174">At initialization, a calibration procedure is performed with software and/or hardware in which test bits are sampled and driven under each combination of the control signals PhShA[i][n:0]. The combination which yields the best margin is selected for each slice. This static value compensates for the flight time of the DQ and AC signals between the controller and the memory components. This flight time is mainly a factor of trace length and propagation velocity on printed wiring boards, and does not vary much during system operation. Other delay variations due to supply voltage and temperature are automatically tracked out by the feedback loops of the PLLs in the system.</p>

This is accomplished with an eight bit register which can be inserted into the path of the read and write data for each slice. The insertion of the delay is determined by the two control buses TPhShC[31:0] and RPhShC[31:0]. There is one control bit for each slice, since the propagation delay of the read and write data may cross a ClkC boundary at any memory slice position. Some systems with larger skews in the read and write data across the memory slices may need more than one ClkC of adjustment.

  <p num="p-0184">The circuit transfers the data in the RClkC<b>1</b>B clock domain to the ClkC domain. These two clocks have the same frequency, but may have any phase alignment. The solution is to sample RClkC<b>1</b>B with a delayed version of ClkC called ClkCD (the limits on the amount of delay can be determined by the system, but in one embodiment, the nominal delay is ¼ of a ClkC cycle). This sampled value is called SkipR, and it determines whether the data in an RClkC<b>1</b>B register may be transferred directly to a ClkC register, or whether the data must first pass through a negative-edge-triggered ClkC register.</p>

  <p num="p-0192"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> generally summarizes the possible phase alignments of RClkC<b>1</b>B and ClkC as eight cases labeled A<b>0</b> through D<b>1</b>. These cases are distinguished by the position of the RClkC<b>1</b>B rising and falling edge relative to the set/hold window of the rising edge of ClkCD which samples RClkC<b>1</b>B to determine the SkipR value. Clearly, if the RClkC<b>1</b>B rising or falling edge is outside of this window, it will be correctly sampled. If it is at the edge of the window or inside the window, then it can be sampled as either a zero or one (i.e., the validity of the sample cannot be ensured). The skip logic has been designed such that it functions properly in either case, and this then determines the limits on the delay of the ClkCD clock tD.</p>
  <p num="p-0193">For the receive block, case B<b>0</b> <b>1905</b> has the worst case setup constraint, and case A<b>1</b> <b>1904</b> has the worst case hold constraint:

The value of t<sub>D </sub>can vary up to the t<sub>D,MAX </sub>value shown above, or down to the t<sub>D,MIN </sub>value, also shown above. If the setup (e.g., t<sub>S1</sub>, t<sub>S</sub>), hold (e.g., t<sub>H1</sub>, t<sub>H</sub>), multiplexer propagation delay (e.g., t<sub>M</sub>), and valid (e.g., t<sub>V</sub>) times all went to zero, then the t<sub>D </sub>value could vary up to t<sub>CH,MIN </sub>(the minimum high time of ClkC) and down to zero. However, the finite set/hold window of registers, and the finite clock-to-output (valid time) delay and multiplexer delay combine to reduce the permissible variation of the t<sub>D </sub>value.</p>
  <p num="p-0195">Note that it would be possible to change some of the elements of the skip logic without changing its basic function. For example, a sampling clock ClkCD may be used that is earlier rather than later (the constraint equations are changed, but there is a similar dependency of the timing skew range of ClkC to ClkCD upon the various set, hold, and valid timing parameters). In other embodiments, a negative-edge-triggered RClkC<b>1</b>B register is used instead of a ClkC register into the domain-crossing path (again, the constraint equations are changed, but a similar dependency of the timing skew range of ClkC to ClkCD upon the various set, hold, and valid timing parameters remains).</p>
  <p num="p-0196">Finally, it should be noted that the skip value that is used is preferably generated once during initialization and then loaded (with the LoadSkip control signal) into a register. Such a static value is preferable to rather than one that is sampled on every ClkCD edge because if the alignment of RClkC<b>1</b>B is such that it has a transition in the set/hold window of the ClkCD sampling register, it may generate different skip values each time it is sampled. This would not affect the reliability of the clock domain crossing (the RClkC<b>1</b>B date would be correctly transferred to the ClkC register), but it would affect the apparent latency of the read data as measured in ClkC cycles in the controller. That is, sometimes the read data would take a ClkC cycle longer than at other times. Sampling the skip value and using it for all domain crossings solves this problem. Also note that during calibration, every time the RClkC<b>1</b>B phase is adjusted, the LoadSkip control is pulsed in case the skip value changes.</p>

  <p num="p-0198">The circuit of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is used in the transfer of data in the ClkC clock domain to the TClkC<b>1</b>B domain. The two clocks ClkC and TClkC<b>1</b>B have the same frequency, but may be phase mismatched. One technique that can be used in the clock domain crossing is to sample TClkC<b>1</b>B with a delayed version of ClkC called ClkCD (the limits on the amount of delay can vary, but in one embodiment, the delay selected is ¼ of a ClkC cycle). The sampled value, SkipT, determines whether the data in a ClkC register is transferred directly to a TClkC<b>1</b>B register, or whether the data first passes through a negative-edge-triggered ClkC register.</p>

  <p num="p-0227">As a reminder, the example system described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> included single memory module, a single rank of memory components on that module, a common address and control bus (so that each controller pin connects to a pin on each of two or more memory components), and a sliced data bus (wherein each controller pin connects to a pin on exactly one memory component). These characteristics were chosen for the example embodiment in order to simplify the discussion of the details and because this configuration is an illustrative special case. However, the clocking methods that have been discussed can be extended to a wider range of system topologies. Thus, it should be understood that embodiments of the invention may be practiced with systems having features that differ from the features of the example system of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0228">The rest of this discussion focuses on systems with multiple memory modules or multiple memory ranks per module (or both). In these systems, each data bus wire connects to one controller pin and to one pin on each of two or more memory components. Since the t<sub>PD2 </sub>propagation delay between the controller and each of the memory components will be different, the clock domain crossing issue in the controller becomes more complicated. If the choice is made to align all clocks in each memory component, then the controller will need a set of domain crossing hardware for each rank or module of memory components in a slice. This suffers from a drawback in that it requires a large amount of controller area and that it adversely affects critical timing paths. As such, in a multiple module or multiple rank system, it may be preferable to keep all of the clocks aligned in the controller, and to place the domain crossing logic in the memory components.</p>

In this example, there is a dedicated data bus for each slice of each module. Each data bus is shared by the ranks of memory devices on each module.
