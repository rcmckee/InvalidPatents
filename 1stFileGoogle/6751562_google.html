The architecture includes multiple intelligent electronic devices (“IED&#39;s”) distributed throughout the power distribution system to manage the flow and consumption of power from the system. The IED&#39;s are linked via a network to back-end servers. Power management application software and/or hardware components operate on the IED&#39;s and the back-end servers and inter-operate via the network to implement a power management application. The communications between the IED&#39;s and the back-end servers are facilitated through network security devices such as firewalls. The architecture provides a scalable and cost effective framework of hardware and software upon which such power management applications can operate to manage the distribution and consumption of electrical power by one or more utilities/suppliers and/or customers which provide and utilize the power distribution system."><meta name="DC.date" content="2004-6-15" scheme="issued"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:20010010032:A1" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:20010039837:A1" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:20020010801:A1" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:20020077729:A1" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:20020091784:A1" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:20020116550:A1" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:20020120723:A1" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:20020161536:A1" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:20020162014:A1" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:20020165677:A1" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:20030176952:A1" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4589075" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:4641248" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5448229" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5459459" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5477216" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5495239" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5517423" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5572438" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5576700" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5680324" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5699276" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5736847" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5764155" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5862391" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5897607" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:5963734" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:6005759" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:6035285" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:6088659" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:6115393" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:6118269" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:6167389" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:6169979" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:6178362" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:6259972" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:6301527" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:6313752" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:6327541" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:6535797" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:6549880" scheme="references"><meta name="DC.relation" content="US:6553418" scheme="references"><meta name="citation_reference" content="A8800-1 AcquiSuite Data Acquisition System specification, pp. 1-2, Sep. 24, 2001."><meta name="citation_reference" content="Advertisement, EiServer and RTU+Server, source, Metering International-2001 Issue 1, p. 19, published date 1&lt;st &gt;Quarter 2001, p. 1."><meta name="citation_reference" content="Advertisement, EiServer and RTU+Server, source, Metering International—2001 Issue 1, p. 19, published date 1st Quarter 2001, p. 1."><meta name="citation_reference" content="Article, &quot;Providing Tomorrow&#39;s Energy Management and Metering Tools Today,&quot; source, Metering International-2001 Issue 1, p. 18, publish date 1&lt;st &gt;Quarter 2001, p. 1."><meta name="citation_reference" content="Article, “Providing Tomorrow&#39;s Energy Management and Metering Tools Today,” source, Metering International—2001 Issue 1, p. 18, publish date 1st Quarter 2001, p. 1."><meta name="citation_reference" content="ATI Systems, &quot;Technical Overview Ethernet SCAN II(TM) Module&quot; specification, Oct. 1994, 2 pages."><meta name="citation_reference" content="ATI Systems, “Technical Overview Ethernet SCAN II™ Module” specification, Oct. 1994, 2 pages."><meta name="citation_reference" content="Axeda Access, 3 pages, obtained http://www.axeda.com/solutions/portals/portal_access.html, printed Jun. 9, 2003.

The architecture includes multiple intelligent electronic devices (“IED&#39;s”) distributed throughout the power distribution system to manage the flow and consumption of power from the system. The IED&#39;s are linked via a network to back-end servers. Power management application software and/or hardware components operate on the IED&#39;s and the back-end servers and inter-operate via the network to implement a power management application. The communications between the IED&#39;s and the back-end servers are facilitated through network security devices such as firewalls. The architecture provides a scalable and cost effective framework of hardware and software upon which such power management applications can operate to manage the distribution and consumption of electrical power by one or more utilities/suppliers and/or customers which provide and utilize the power distribution system."/><meta property="og:title" content="Patent US6751562 - Communications architecture for intelligent electronic devices"/><meta property="og:type" content="book"/><meta property="og:site_name" content="Google Books"/><meta property="og:image" content="http://www.google.com/patents?id=&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1"/><link rel="image_src" href="http://www.google.com/patents?id=&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1"/><script>(function(){try{var aa=function(a,b,c,d){d=d||{};d._sn=["cfg",b,c].join(".");window.gbar.logger.ml(a,d)};var g=window.gbar=window.gbar||{},l=window.gbar.i=window.gbar.i||{},m={},n;function _tvn(a,b){var c=parseInt(a,10);return isNaN(c)?b:c}function _tvf(a,b){var c=parseFloat(a);return isNaN(c)?b:c}function _tvv(a){return!!a}function p(a,b,c){(c||g)[a]=b}g.bv={n:_tvn("2",0),r:"",f:".67.",e:"0",m:_tvn("0",1)};

The architecture includes multiple intelligent electronic devices (“IED's”) distributed throughout the power distribution system to manage the flow and consumption of power from the system. The IED's are linked via a network to back-end servers. Power management application software and/or hardware components operate on the IED's and the back-end servers and inter-operate via the network to implement a power management application. The communications between the IED's and the back-end servers are facilitated through network security devices such as firewalls. The architecture provides a scalable and cost effective framework of hardware and software upon which such power management applications can operate to manage the distribution and consumption of electrical power by one or more utilities/suppliers and/or customers which provide and utilize the power distribution system.</div>

    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading> <p>With the advent of high technology needs and market deregulation, today's energy market has become very dynamic. High technology industries have increased their demands on the electrical power supplier, requiring more power, increased reliability and lower costs. A typical computer data center may use 100 to 300 watts of energy per square foot compared to an average of 15 watts per square foot for a typical commercial building. Further, an electrical outage, whether it is a complete loss of power or simply a drop in the delivered voltage, can cost these companies millions of dollars in down time and lost business.</p>
    <p>In addition, deregulation of the energy industry is allowing both industrial and individual consumers the unprecedented capability to choose their supplier which is fostering a competitive supply/demand driven market in what was once a traditionally monopolistic industry.</p>
    <p>The requirements of increased demand and higher reliability are burdening an already overtaxed distribution network and forcing utilities to invest in infrastructure improvements at a time when the deregulated competitive market is forcing them to cut costs and lower prices. Accordingly, there is a need for a system of managing the distribution and consumption of electrical power which meets the increased demands of users and allows the utility supplier to compete in a deregulated competitive marketplace.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY</heading> <p>The present invention is defined by the following claims, and nothing in this section should be taken as a limitation on those claims.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p>Intelligent electronic devices (“IED's”) such as programmable logic controllers (“PLC's”), Remote Terminal Units (“RTU's”), electric/watt hour meters, protection relays and fault recorders are widely available that make use of memory and microprocessors to provide increased versatility and additional functionality. Such functionality includes the ability to communicate with remote computing systems, either via a direct connection, e.g. modem or via a network. For more detailed information regarding IED's capable of network communication, please refer to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/798,723, captioned above. In particular, the monitoring of electrical power, especially the measuring and calculating of electrical parameters, provides valuable information for power utilities and their customers. Monitoring of electrical power is important to ensure that the electrical power is effectively and efficiently generated, distributed and utilized. Various different arrangements are presently available for monitoring, measuring, and controlling power parameters. Typically, an IED, such as an individual power measuring device, is placed on a given branch or line proximate to one or more loads which are coupled with the branch or line in order to measure/monitor power system parameters. Herein, the phrase “coupled with” is defined to mean directly connected to or indirectly connected with through one or more intermediate components. Such intermediate components may include both hardware and software based components. In addition to monitoring power parameters of a certain load(s), such power monitoring devices have a variety of other applications. For example, power monitoring devices can be used in supervisory control and data acquisition (“SCADA”) systems such as the XA/21 Energy Management System manufactured by GE Harris Energy Control Systems located in Melbourne, Fla.</p>
    <p>In a typical SCADA application, IED's/power measuring devices individually dial-in to a central SCADA computer system via a modem. However, such dial-in systems are limited by the number of inbound telephone lines to the SCADA computer and the availability of phone service access to the IED/power measuring devices. With a limited number of inbound telephone lines, the number of IED's/power measuring devices that can simultaneously report their data is limited resulting in limited data throughput and delayed reporting. Further, while cellular based modems and cellular system access are widely available, providing a large number of power measuring devices with phone service is cumbersome and often cost prohibitive. The overall result is a system that is not easily scalable to handle a large number of IED's/power measuring devices or the increased bandwidth and throughput requirements of advanced power management applications. However, the ability to use a computer network infrastructure, such as the Internet, allows for the use of power parameter and data transmission and reporting on a large scale. The Internet provides a connectionless point to point communications medium that is capable of supporting substantially simultaneous communications among a large number of devices. For example this existing Internet infrastructure can be used to simultaneously push out billing, load profile, or power quality data to a large number of IED/power measurement and control devices located throughout a power distribution system that can be used by those devices to analyze or make intelligent decisions based on power consumption at their locations. The bandwidth and throughput capabilities of the Internet supports the additional requirements of advanced power management applications. For example, billing data, or other certified revenue data, must be transferred through a secure process which prevents unauthorized access to the data and ensures receipt of the data by the appropriate device or entity. Utilizing the Internet, communications can be encrypted such as by using encrypted email. Further, encryption authentication parameters such as time/date stamp or the IED serial number, can be employed. Within the Internet, there are many other types of communications applications that may be employed to facilitate the above described inter-device communications such as email, Telnet, file transfer protocol (“FTP”), trivial file transfer protocol (“TFTP”) or proprietary systems, both unsecured and secure/encrypted.</p>
    <p>As used herein, Intelligent electronic devices (“IED's”) include Programmable Logic Controllers (“PLC's”), Remote Terminal Units (“RTU's”), electric power meters, protective relays, fault recorders and other devices which are coupled with power distribution networks to manage and control the distribution and consumption of electrical power. Such devices typically utilize memory and microprocessors executing software to implement the desired power management function. IED's include on-site devices coupled with particular loads or portions of an electrical distribution system and are used to monitor and manage power generation, distribution and consumption. IED's are also referred herein as power management devices (“PMD's”).</p>
    <p>A Remote Terminal Unit (“RTU”) is a field device installed on an electrical power distribution system at the desired point of metering. It is equipped with input channels (for sensing or metering), output channels (for control, indication or alarms) and a communications port. Metered information is typically available through a communication protocol via a serial communication port. An exemplary RTU is the XP Series, manufactured by Quindar Productions Ltd. in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada.</p>
    <p>A Programmable Logic Controller (“PLC”) is a solid-state control system that has a user-programmable memory for storage of instructions to implement specific functions such as Input/output (I/O) control, logic, timing, counting, report generation, communication, arithmetic, and data file manipulation. A PLC consists of a central processor, input/output interface, and memory. A PLC is designed as an industrial control system. An exemplary PLC is the SLC 500 Series, manufactured by Allen-Bradley in Milwaukee, Wis.</p>
    <p>A meter, is a device that records and measures power events, power quality, current, voltage waveforms, harmonics, transients and other power disturbances. Revenue accurate meters (“revenue meter”) relate to revenue accuracy electrical power metering devices with the ability to detect, monitor, report, quantify and communicate power quality information about the power which they are metering. An exemplary meter is the model 8500 meter, manufactured by Power Measurement Ltd, in Saanichton, B.C. Canada.</p>
    <p>A protective relay is an electrical device that is designed to interpret input conditions in a prescribed manner, and after specified conditions are met, to cause contact operation or similar abrupt change in associated electric circuits. A relay may consist of several relay units, each responsive to a specified input, with the combination of units providing the desired overall performance characteristics of the relay. Inputs are usually electric but may be mechanical, thermal or other quantity, or a combination thereof. An exemplary relay is the type N and KC, manufactured by ABB in Raleigh, N.C.</p>
    <p>A fault recorder is a device that records the waveform and digital inputs, such as breaker status which resulting from a fault in a line, such as a fault caused by a break in the line. An exemplary fault recorder is the IDM, manufactured by Hathaway Corp in Littleton, Colo.</p>
    <p>IED's can also be created from existing electromechanical meters or solid-state devices by the addition of a monitoring and control device which converts the mechanical rotation of the rotary counter into electrical pulses or monitors the pulse output of the meter. An exemplary electromechanical meter is the ABl Meter manufactured by ABB in Raleigh, N.C. Such conversion devices are known in the art.</p>
    <p>This invention describes a communications architecture that can be used for monitoring, protection and control of devices and electrical power distribution in an electrical power distribution system, where IED's can interact with other IED's and attached devices.</p>
    <p>As will be described in more detail below, a power management architecture for an electrical power distribution system, or portion thereof, is disclosed. The architecture provides a scalable and cost effective framework of hardware and software upon which power management applications can operate to manage the distribution and consumption of electrical power by one or more utilities/suppliers and/or customers which provide and utilize the power distribution system.</p>
    <p>Power management applications include automated meter reading applications, load shedding applications, deregulated supplier management applications, on-site power generation management applications, power quality management applications, protection/safety applications, and general distribution system management applications, such as equipment inventory and maintenance applications. A power management application typically includes one or more application components which utilize the power management architecture to interoperate and communicate thereby implementing the power management application.</p>
    <p>The architecture includes Intelligent Electronic Devices (“IED's”) distributed throughout the power distribution system to monitor and control the flow of electrical power. IED's may be positioned along the supplier's distribution path or within a customer's internal distribution system. IED's include revenue electric watt-hour meters, protection relays, programmable logic controllers, remote terminal units, fault recorders and other devices used to monitor and/or control electrical power distribution and consumption. As was noted, IED's also include legacy mechanical or electromechanical devices which have been retrofitted with appropriate hardware and/or software so as to be able to integrate with the power management architecture. Typically an IED is associated with a particular load or set of loads which are drawing electrical power from the power distribution system. As was described above, the IED may also be capable of receiving data from or controlling its associated load. Depending on the type of IED and the type of load it may be associated with, the IED implements a power management function such as measuring power consumption, controlling power distribution such as a relay function, monitoring power quality, measuring power parameters such as phasor components, voltage or current, controlling power generation facilities, or combinations thereof. For functions which produce data or other results, the IED can push the data onto the network to another IED or back end server, automatically or event driven, (discussed in more detail below) or the IED can wait for a polling communication which requests that the data be transmitted to the requester.</p>
    <p>In addition, the IED is also capable of implementing an application component of a power management application utilizing the architecture. As was described above and further described below, the power management application includes power management application components which are implemented on different portions of the power management architecture and communicate with one another via the architecture network. The operation of the power management application components and their interactions/communications implement the power management application. One or more power management applications may be utilizing the architecture at any given time and therefore, the IED may implement one or more power management application components at any given time.</p>
    <p>The architecture further includes a communications network. Preferably, the communication network is a publicly accessible data network such as the Internet or other network or combination of sub-networks that transmit data utilizing the transport control protocol/internet protocol (“TCP/IP”) protocol suite. Such networks include private intranet networks, virtual private networks, extranets or combinations thereof and combinations which include the Internet. Alternatively, other communications network architectures may also be used. Each IED preferably includes the software and/or hardware necessary to facilitate communications over the communications network by the hardware and/or software which implements the power management functions and power management application components. In alternative embodiments, quality of service protocols can be implemented to guarantee timely data delivery, especially in real time applications.</p>
    <p>The hardware and/or software which facilitate network communications preferably includes a communications protocol stack which provides a standard interface to which the power management functions hardware/software and power management application components hardware/software interact. As will be discussed in more detail below, in one embodiment, the communications protocol stack is a layered architecture of software components. In the preferred embodiments these layers or software components include an applications layer, a transport layer, a routing layer, a switching layer and an interface layer.</p>
    <p>The applications layer includes the software which implements the power management functions and the power management applications components. Further, the applications layer also includes the communication software applications which support the available methods of network communications. Typically, the power management function software interacts with the power management hardware to monitor and or control the portion of the power distribution system and/or the load coupled with the IED. The application component typically interacts with the power management function software to control the power management function or process data monitored by the power management function. One or both of the power management function software and the power management application component software interacts with the communication software applications in order to communicate over the network with other devices.</p>
    <p>The communications applications include electronic mail client applications such as applications which support SMTP, MIME or POP network communications protocols, security client applications such as encryption/decryption or authentication applications such as secure-HTTP or secure sockets layer (“SSL”), or other clients which support standard network communications protocols such as telnet, hypertext transport protocol (“HTTP”), file transfer protocol (“FTP”), network news transfer protocol (“NNTP”), instant messaging client applications, or combinations thereof. Other client application protocols include extensible markup language (“XML”) client protocol and associated protocols such as Simple Object Access Protocol (“SOAP”). Further, the communications applications could also include client applications which support peer to peer communications. All of the communications applications preferably include the ability to communicate via the security client applications to secure the communications transmitted via the network from unauthorized access and to ensure that received communications are authentic, uncompromised and received by the intended recipient. Further, the communications applications include the ability to for redundant operation through the use of one or more interface layer components (discussed in more detail below), error detection and correction and the ability to communicate through firewalls or similar private network protection devices.</p>
    <p>The transport layer interfaces the applications layer to the routing layer and accepts communications from the applications layer that are to be transmitted over the network. The transport layer breaks up the communications layer into one or more packets, augments each packet with sequencing data and addressing data and hands each packet to the routing layer. Similarly, packets which are received from the network are reassembled by the transport layer and the re-constructed communications are then handed up to the applications layer and the appropriate communications applications client. The transport layer also ensures that all packets which make up a given transmission are sent or received by the intended destination. Missing or damaged packets are re-requested by the transport layer from the source of the communication. In the preferred embodiment, the transport layer implements the transport control protocol (“TCP”).</p>
    <p>The routing layer interfaces the transport layer to the switching layer. The routing layer routes each packet received from the transport layer over the network. The routing layer augments each packet with the source and destination address information. In the preferred embodiment, the routing layer implements the internet protocol (“IP”). It will be appreciated that the TCP/IP protocols implement a connectionless packet switching network which facilitates scalable substantially simultaneous communications among multiple devices.</p>
    <p>The switching layer interfaces the routing layer to the interface layer. The switching layer and interface layer are typically integrated. The interface layer comprises the actual hardware interface to the network. The interface layer may include an Ethernet interface, a modem, such as wired modem using the serial line interface protocol (“SLIP”) or point to point protocol (“PPP”), wired modem which may be an analog or digital modem such as a integrated services digital network (“ISDN”) modem or digital subscriber line (“DSL”) modem, or a cellular modem. Further, other wireless interfaces, such as Bluetooth, may also be used. In addition, AC power line data network interface may also be used. Cellular modems further provide the functionality to determine the geographic location of the IED using cellular RF triangulation. Such location information can be transmitted along with other power management data as one factor used in authenticating the transmitted data. In the preferred embodiments, the interface layer provided allows for redundant communication capabilities. The interface layer couples the IED with a local area network, such as provided at the customer or utility site. Alternatively, the interface layer can couple the IED with a point of presence provided by a local network provider such as an internet service provider (“ISP”).</p>
    <p>Finally, the architecture includes back-end server computers or data collection devices. Back end servers may be provided by the consumer of electric power, the utility supplier of electric power or a third party. In one embodiment, these devices are IED's themselves. The back end servers are also coupled with the network in a same way as the IED's and may also include a communication protocol stack. The back end servers also implement power management applications components which interact and communicate with the power management application components on the IED's to accomplish the power management application. Preferably, the IED's are programmed with the network addresses of the appropriate back end servers or are capable of probing the network for back end servers to communicate with. Similarly, the back end server is programmed with the network addresses of one or more affiliate IED's or is capable of probing the network to find IED's that are connected. In either case of network probing by the IED or back-end server, software and/or hardware is provided to ensure that back-end servers communicate with authorized IED's and vice versa allowing multiple customers and multiple suppliers to utilize the architecture for various power management applications without interfering with each other.</p>
    <p>The back end servers preferably are executing software application counterparts to the application clients and protocols operating on the IED's such as electronic mail, HTTP, FTP, telnet, NNTP or XML servers which are designed to receive and process communications from the IED's. Exemplary server communications applications include Microsoft Exchange™. The back end server is therefore capable of communicating, substantially simultaneously, with multiple IED's at any given time. Further, the back end server implements a security application which decrypts and/or authenticates communications received from IED's and encrypts communications sent to IED's.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, software executing on the back end server receives communications from an IED and automatically extracts the data from the communication. The data is automatically fed to a power management application component, such as a billing management component.</p>
    <p>In this way, a generally accessible connectionless/scalable communications architecture is provided for operating power management applications. The architecture facilitates IED-supplier communications applications such as for automated meter reading, revenue collection, IED tampering and fraud detection, power quality monitoring, load or generation control, tariff updating or power reliability monitoring. The architecture also supports IED-consumer applications such as usage/cost monitoring, IED tampering and fraud detection, power quality monitoring, power reliability monitoring or control applications such as load shedding/cost control or generation control. In addition, real time deregulated utility/supplier switching applications which respond in real time to energy costs fluctuations can be implemented which automatically switch suppliers based on real time cost. Further the architecture supports communications between IED's such as early warning systems which warn downstream IED's of impending power quality events. The architecture also supports utility/supplier to customer applications such as real time pricing reporting, billing reporting, power quality or power reliability reporting. Customer to customer applications may also be supported wherein customers can share power quality or power reliability data.</p>
    <p>As used herein, an IED or PMD is a power management device capable of network communication. A back end server is a data collection or central command device coupled with the network which receives power management data from an IED and/or generates power management commands to and IED. An IED may contain a back-end server. The network is any communications network which supports the Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (“TCP/IP”) network protocol suite. In the preferred embodiment IED's include devices such as PLC's, RTU's, meters, protection relays, fault recorders or modified electromechanical devices and further include any device which is coupled with an electrical power distribution network, or portion thereof, for the purpose of managing or controlling the distribution or consumption of electrical power.</p>
    <p>FIG. 1 illustrates an overview of the preferred embodiment of the Power Management Architecture (“architecture”) <b>100</b>, which contains one or more IED's <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>107</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>109</b>. The IED's <b>102</b>-<b>109</b> are connected to an electrical power distribution system <b>101</b>, or portion thereof; to measure, monitor and control quality, distribution and consumption of electric power from the system <b>101</b>, or portion thereof. The power distribution system is typically owned by either a utility/supplier or consumer of electric power however some components may be owned and/or leased from third parties. The IED's <b>102</b>-<b>109</b> are further interconnected with each other and back end servers <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>123</b>, <b>124</b> via a network <b>110</b> to implement a Power Management Application (“application”) <b>111</b> (not shown). In the preferred embodiment, the network <b>10</b> is the Internet. Alternatively, the network <b>110</b> can be a private or public intranet, an extranet or combinations thereof, or any network utilizing the Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (“TCP/IP”) network protocol suite to enable communications, including IP tunneling protocols such as those which allow virtual private networks coupling multiple intranets or extranets together via the Internet. The network <b>110</b> may also include portions or sub-networks which use wireless technology to enable communications, such as RF, cellular or Bluetooth technologies. The network <b>110</b> preferably supports application protocols such as telnet, FTP, POP<b>3</b>, SMTP, NNTP, Mime, HTTP, SMTP, SNNP, IMAP, proprietary protocols or other network application protocols as are known in the art as well as transport protocols SLIP, PPP, TCP/IP and other transport protocols known in the art.</p>
    <p>The Power Management Application <b>111</b> utilizes the architecture <b>100</b> and comprises power management application components which implement the particular power management functions required by the application <b>111</b>. The power management application components are located on the IED <b>102</b>-<b>109</b> or on the back end server <b>121</b>-<b>124</b>, or combinations thereof, and can be a client component, a server component or a peer component. Application components communicate with one another over the architecture <b>100</b> to implement the power management application <b>111</b>.</p>
    <p>In one preferred embodiment the architecture <b>100</b> comprises IED's <b>102</b>-<b>109</b> connected via a network <b>110</b> and back end servers <b>120</b>, <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>123</b>, <b>124</b> which further comprise software which utilizes protocol stacks to communicate. IED's <b>102</b>-<b>109</b> can be owned and operated by utilities/suppliers <b>130</b>, <b>131</b>, consumers <b>132</b> <b>133</b> or third parties <b>134</b> or combinations thereof. Back end servers <b>120</b> <b>121</b> <b>122</b> <b>123</b> <b>124</b> can be owned by utilities/suppliers <b>130</b>, <b>131</b>, consumers <b>132</b>, <b>133</b>, third parties <b>134</b> or combinations thereof. For example, an IED <b>102</b>-<b>109</b> is operable to communicate directly over the network with the consumer back-end server <b>120</b>, <b>121</b>, another IED <b>102</b>-<b>19</b> or a utility back end server <b>123</b>,<b>124</b>. In another example, a utility back end server <b>123</b>, <b>124</b> is operable to connect and communicate directly with customer back end servers <b>120</b>, <b>121</b>. Further explanation and examples on the types of data and communication between IED's <b>102</b>-<b>109</b> are given in more detail below.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the architecture's <b>100</b> devices, such as the back end servers <b>120</b>-<b>124</b> or IED's <b>102</b>-<b>109</b>, can contain an email server and associated communications hardware and software such as encryption and decryption software. Other transfer protocols, such as file transfer protocols (FTP), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), HTTP, XML or other protocols know in the art may also be used in place of electronic mail. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol that allows transfer of files to devices connected to the network. FTP is a standard internet protocol that allows exchange of files between devices connected on a network. Extensible markup language (XML) is a file format similar to HTML that allows transfer of data on networks. XML is a flexible, self describing, vendor-neutral way to create common information formats and share both the format and the data over the connection. In the preferred embodiment the data collection server is operable by either the supplier/utility <b>123</b>, <b>124</b> or the customer <b>132</b>, <b>133</b> of the electrical power distribution system <b>101</b>. SOAP allows a program running one kind of operating system to communicate with the same kind, or another kind of operating system, by using HTTP and XML as mechanisms for the information exchange.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the application <b>111</b> includes an authentication and encryption component which encrypts commands transmitted across the network <b>110</b>, and decrypts power management data received over the network <b>110</b>. Authentication is also performed for commands or data sent or received over the network <b>110</b>. Authentication is the process of determining and verifying whether the IED <b>102</b>-<b>109</b> transmitting data or receiving commands is the IED <b>102</b>-<b>109</b> it declares itself to be and in the preferred embodiment authentication includes parameters such as time/date stamps, digital certificates, physical locating algorithms such as cellular triangulation, serial or tracking ID's, which could include geographic location such as longitude and latitude. Authentication prevents fraudulent substitution of IED <b>102</b>-<b>109</b> devices or spoofing of IED <b>102</b>-<b>109</b> data generation in an attempt to defraud. Authentication also minimizes data collection and power distribution system <b>101</b> control errors by verifying that data is being generated and commands are being received by the appropriate devices. In the preferred embodiment encryption is done utilizing Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). PGP uses a variation of public key system, where each user has a publicly known encryption key and a private key known only to that user. The public key system and infrastructure enables users of unsecured networks, such as the internet, to securely and privately exchange data through the use of public and private cryptographic key pairs.</p>
    <p>In the preferred embodiment the architecture is connectionless which allows for substantially simultaneous communications between a substantial number of IED's within the architecture. This form of scalability eclipses the current architectures that utilize point to point connections, such as provided by telephony networks, between devices to enable communications which limit the number of simultaneous communications that may take place.</p>
    <p>FIG. 2<i>a </i>illustrates a preferred embodiment where and IED <b>200</b> contains several power management components <b>201</b> <b>202</b> <b>203</b> and power management circuitry <b>220</b>. The power management circuitry <b>220</b> is operable to implement the IED's functionality, such as metering/measuring power delivered to the load <b>218</b> from the electrical power distribution system <b>216</b>, measuring and monitoring power quality, implementing a protection relay function, or other functionality of the IED <b>200</b>. The IED <b>200</b> further includes a power management application components <b>211</b> coupled with the circuitry <b>220</b> and a protocol stack <b>212</b> and data communication interface <b>213</b>. The protocol stack <b>212</b> and data communications interface <b>213</b> allow the IED <b>200</b> to communicate over the network <b>215</b>. It will be appreciated that, as described below, the protocol stack <b>212</b> may include an interface layer which comprises the data communications interface <b>213</b>. The power management application components <b>211</b> include software and/or hardware components which, alone, or in combination with other components, implement the power management application <b>111</b>. The components <b>211</b> may include components which analyze and log the metered/measured data, power quality data or control operation of the IED <b>200</b>, such as controlling a relay circuit. The components <b>211</b> further include software and/or hardware which processes and communicates data from the IED <b>200</b> to other remote devices over the network <b>215</b>, such as back end servers <b>121</b>-<b>124</b> or other IED's <b>200</b> (<b>102</b>-<b>109</b>), as will be described below. For example, the IED <b>200</b> is connected to a load <b>218</b>. The power management circuitry <b>220</b> includes data logging software applications, memory and a CPU, which are configured to store kWh data from the load <b>218</b> in a memory contained within the power management circuitry. The stored data is then read and processed by the components <b>201</b> <b>202</b> in the power management application <b>211</b>. The components communicate with operating system components which contain the protocol stack <b>212</b> and the processed data is passed over the network <b>215</b> to the appropriate party via the data communications interface <b>213</b>. One or more of the components <b>211</b> may communicate with one or more application components located on one or other IED's <b>200</b> and/or one or more back end servers <b>121</b>-<b>124</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 2<i>b </i>illustrates an alternate preferred embodiment where an IED <b>240</b> is provided which includes power management application components <b>290</b>. A load <b>280</b> is connected to an IED <b>240</b> via the electrical power distribution system <b>281</b>. The IED <b>240</b> is further connected to the network <b>283</b>. The IED <b>240</b> contains power management circuitry which is operable to implement the IED's functionality, such as receiving power and generating data from the load <b>280</b>. The IED further includes a protocol stack layer <b>284</b> and a data communication interface <b>286</b> which allows the back end server to communicate over the network <b>283</b>. The power management application components <b>290</b> include one or more components such as data collection component <b>250</b>, an automated meter reading component <b>253</b> and a billing/revenue management component <b>252</b>, which may be revenue certified, a peer-to-peer power management component <b>257</b>, a usage and consumption management component <b>258</b>, a distributed power management component <b>254</b>, a centralized power management component <b>255</b>, a load management component <b>259</b>, an electrical power generation management component <b>260</b>, an IED inventory component <b>261</b>, an IED maintenance component <b>262</b>, an IED fraud detection component <b>263</b>, a power quality monitoring component <b>264</b>, a power outage component <b>265</b>, a device management component <b>251</b>, a power reliability component <b>256</b>, or combinations thereof. Furthermore, components contained on one IED <b>240</b> may operate simultaneously with components on an IED <b>102</b>-<b>109</b>, <b>200</b> or another IED <b>240</b> or back end server (not shown). More component details and examples are given below.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment the application components comprise software components, such as an email server or an XML or HTTP server. These servers may include a Microsoft Exchange server or a BizTalk framework/XML compatible server. A Microsoft Exchange™ server is an email server computer program manufactured by Microsoft Corporation, located in Redmond, Wash., typically operating on a server computer which facilitates the reception and transmission of emails, and forwards emails to the email client programs, such as Microsoft Outlook™, of users that have accounts on the server. BizTalk is a computer industry initiative which promotes XML as the common data exchange for e-commerce and application integration over the internet. BizTalk provides frameworks and guidelines for how to publish standard data structures in XML and how to use XML messages to integrate software components or programs. Alternately, hardware components, such as a dedicated cellular phone, GPS encryption or decryption key or dongle are included in the components. In a further embodiment, a combination of both hardware and software components are utilized. Additionally, referring back to FIG. 1, one or more power management application components <b>290</b> can utilize the architecture <b>100</b> to implement their functionality. For example, a utility <b>130</b> has a back end server <b>124</b> which contains power management application and associated components, such as a usage and consumption monitoring component <b>258</b>. The utility <b>130</b> supplies power to a consumer <b>132</b> via the power distribution network <b>110</b> and monitors the consumers power consumption using the power management application components on the back end server <b>124</b> which communicates with the IED's <b>104</b>, <b>105</b>, <b>108</b> via the network <b>110</b> to retrieve measured consumption/usage data. The consumer <b>132</b> concurrently monitors usage of loads <b>150</b>, using an IED <b>104</b>, <b>105</b>, <b>108</b> which is connected to the network <b>110</b>, computing real time costs posted by the utility <b>130</b>. In one embodiment, the consumer <b>132</b> monitors usage using back end server <b>120</b> which receives usage and consumption data from the IED's <b>104</b>, <b>105</b>, <b>108</b> via the network <b>110</b>. The IED <b>104</b>, <b>105</b>, <b>108</b> implements power management application components such as load management components and billing management components. One back end server <b>120</b>, <b>124</b> implements power management application components such as a data collection component, a billing/revenue management component, an automated meter reading component or a usage/consumption management component. The components on the IED <b>104</b>, <b>105</b>, <b>108</b> work in concert with the components on the back end server <b>120</b>, <b>124</b> via the network <b>110</b> to implement the overall power management application. In a further embodiment, one or more power management application components are operating on IED <b>104</b>, <b>105</b>, <b>108</b> and/or back end servers <b>120</b>, <b>124</b> at any given time. Each power management application can be utilized by one or more users, or different applications can be used by different users. Moreover, the application components can exist on the same or different IED's <b>104</b>, <b>105</b>, <b>108</b> or back end servers <b>120</b>, <b>124</b>.</p>
    <p>In the preferred embodiment, the data collection component <b>250</b> enables an IED to collect and collate data from either a single or multiple sources via the network <b>110</b>. The data collected by the component is stored and can be retrieved by other components of the power management application components <b>290</b>, or other components implemented on other IED's <b>102</b>-<b>109</b> located on the network <b>110</b>. In the preferred embodiment the Automated Meter Reading component <b>253</b> is utilized to allow either the consumers <b>132</b>, <b>133</b> or providers <b>130</b>, <b>131</b> to generate power management reports from the IED data. In the preferred embodiment the electrical power generation management component <b>260</b> analyzes data received from IED's <b>102</b>-<b>109</b> to either minimize or maximize measured or computed values such as revenue, cost, consumption or usage by use of handling and manipulating power systems and load routing. IED inventory, maintenance and fraud detection component <b>261</b>, <b>262</b>, <b>263</b> receive or request communications from the IED's <b>102</b>-<b>109</b> allowing the power management application to inventory the installed base of IED's <b>102</b>-<b>109</b>, including establishing or confirming their geographic installation location, or check the maintenance history of all connected IED's <b>102</b>-<b>109</b> These power management applications aid in confirming outage locations or authenticating communications to or from an IED <b>102</b>-<b>109</b> to prevent fraud and minimize errors. In one embodiment, the IED inventory component <b>261</b> utilizes cellular triangulation technologies, or caller ID based geographic locator technologies to determine and verify IED inventories. In the preferred embodiment the fraud detection component <b>263</b> further detects device tampering. In the preferred embodiment the power quality monitoring component <b>264</b> monitors and processes electric parameters, such as current, voltage and energy which include volts, amps, Watts, phase relationships between waveforms, kWh, kvAr, power factor, and frequency, etc. The power quality monitoring component <b>264</b> reports alarms, alerts, warnings and general power quality status, based on the monitored parameters, directly to the appropriate user, such as customers <b>132</b>, <b>133</b> or utilities <b>130</b>, <b>131</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 3<i>a </i>illustrates a preferred embodiment of an IED <b>302</b> for use with the disclosed power management architecture <b>100</b>. The IED <b>302</b> is preferably coupled with a load <b>301</b> via a power a distribution system <b>300</b>, or portion thereof. The IED <b>302</b> includes device circuitry <b>305</b> and a data communications interface <b>306</b>. The IED <b>302</b> is further coupled with a network <b>307</b>. The device circuitry <b>305</b> includes the internal hardware and software of the device, such as the CPU <b>305</b> <i>a</i>, memory <b>305</b> <i>c</i>, firmware and software applications <b>305</b> <i>d</i>, data measurement functions <b>305</b> <i>b </i>and communications protocol stack <b>305</b> <i>e</i>. The data communication interface <b>306</b> couples the device circuitry <b>305</b> of the IED <b>302</b> with the communications network <b>307</b>. Alternate embodiments may have power management control functions <b>305</b> <i>b </i>in place of data measurement circuitry. For example, a relay may include a control device and corresponding control functions that regulate electricity flow to a load based on preset parameters. Alternately a revenue meter may include data measurement circuitry that logs and processes data from a connected load. IED's may contain one or the other or combinations of circuitry. In an alternate embodiment the circuitry includes phasor monitoring circuits (not shown) which comprise phasor transducers that receive analog signals representative of parameters of electricity in a circuit over the power distribution system. Further detail and discussion regarding the phasor circuitry is discussed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/798,723, captioned above.</p>
    <p>FIG. 3<i>b </i>illustrates a more detailed embodiment of the IED's <b>310</b> power management application components <b>311</b> and protocol stacks. The IED <b>310</b> includes power management application components <b>311</b>, a communications protocol stack <b>312</b> and a data communications interface <b>313</b> (as was noted above, in alternate embodiments, the protocol stack <b>312</b> may include the data communications interface <b>313</b>). The application components <b>311</b> includes a Load management component <b>315</b> <i>a</i>, which measures the load's <b>301</b> consumption of electrical power from the portion of the power distribution system <b>316</b>, a Power Quality component <b>315</b> <i>b</i>, which measures power quality characteristics of the power on the portion of the power distribution system <b>316</b>, and a billing/revenue management component <b>315</b> <i>c</i>, which computes the quantity and associated value of the incoming power. The power management components are connected to the network via the data communications interface <b>312</b> using the communications protocol stack <b>312</b> (described in more detail below).</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, a Billing/Revenue Management component on a back end server receives the billing and revenue computations over the network <b>307</b> from the billing/revenue management component <b>315</b> <i>c </i>on the IED <b>310</b>. These computations are translated into billing and revenue tracking data of the load <b>317</b> associated with the IED <b>310</b>. The Billing/Revenue Management component on the back end server then reports the computations to the appropriate party operating that particular back end server or subscribing to a service provided by the operator the back end server, either the consumer or provider of the electrical power. Additionally, the Billing/Revenue Management component <b>315</b> <i>c </i>on the IED <b>310</b> or the Billing/Revenue Management component on the back end server computes usage and cost computations and tracking data of the associated load and reports the data to the appropriate party. In a still another embodiment, IED <b>310</b> transmits billing and revenue data directly to the Billing/Revenue Management component over the network <b>307</b> and the Billing/Revenue Management component computes usage and cost computations and tracking data of the associated load and reports the data directly to the appropriate party. Furthermore, tariff data received from the utility by the Billing/Revenue Management component <b>315</b> <i>c </i>is factored into usage or cost computations.</p>
    <p>FIG. 3<i>c </i>illustrates a preferred embodiment of the communications protocol stack <b>305</b> <i>e</i>. In the preferred embodiment the connection between devices coupled with the network <b>110</b> is established via the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (“TCP/IP”) protocol suite. To facilitate communications over a network or other communications medium, devices typically include a set of software components known as a protocol stack. The protocol stack handles all of the details related to communicating over a given network so that other application programs executing on the device need not be aware of these details. The protocol stack effectively interfaces one or more application programs executing on the device to the network to which the device is connected. Typically, the protocol stack is arranged as a layered architecture with one or more software components in each layer. In the preferred embodiment, the protocol stack includes an application layer <b>321</b>, a transport layer <b>322</b>, a routing layer <b>323</b>, a switching layer <b>324</b> and an interface layer <b>325</b>. The application layer <b>321</b> includes all of the applications component software and/or power management component software. The application layer <b>321</b> is coupled with the transport layer <b>322</b>. Applications or software components in the application layer communicate with the transport layer in order to communicate over the network. In the preferred embodiment, the transport layer is implemented as the Transmission Control Protocol (“TCP”). The transport layer, using TCP, divides communications from the applications of the application layer <b>321</b> into one or more packets for transmission across the network. The transport layer adds information about the packet sequence to each packet plus source and destination information about what application component generated the communication and to what application component on the receiving end the communication should be delivered to once reassembled from the constituent packets. The routing layer is coupled with the transport layer and is responsible for routing each packet over the network to its intended destination. In the preferred embodiment, the routing layer is implemented as the Internet Protocol (“IP”) and utilizes internet protocol addresses to properly route each packet of a given communication. The switching and interface layers <b>324</b>, <b>325</b> complete the protocol stack and facilitate use of the physical hardware which couples the device to the network. This hardware may include an Ethernet interface, a modem, or other form of physical network connecting including RF based connections such as Bluetooth interfaces. Generally, the preferred embodiments are capable of communicating via any network which transmits information utilizing the TCP and IP, collectively TCP/IP, protocols as are known in the art. TCP/IP is essentially the basic communication language of the both the Internet and private intranets. TCP/IP utilizes the communications protocol stack and can be described as comprising a TCP layer which manages the decomposing and reassembling of messages from the application layer <b>321</b> into smaller more manageable packets, and the IP layer which handles the addressing of the packets. The IP layer comprises the routing layer <b>323</b>, the switching layer <b>324</b> and the interface layer <b>325</b>. The interface layer <b>325</b>, as described above, makes the physical connection with the network utilizing connections such as Ethernet, dial-up-modems, Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), Serial Line Interface Protocol (SLIP), cellular modems, T1, Integrated Service Digital Network (IDSN), Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), Bluetooth, RF, fiber-optics or AC power line communications. In an alternate embodiment multiple interface layers <b>325</b> are present. For example, the interface layer <b>325</b> contains both an Ethernet and cellular modem thus enabling the IED to connect to the network with either interface. This redundancy is advantageous if one interface is inoperable due to a local Ethernet or cellular network outage. It is preferable that one or more of the application components in the application layer <b>321</b> implement TCP compatible protocols for the exchange of their communications over the network. Such TCP compatible protocols include the Instant Messaging protocol, file transfer protocol (“FTP”), or Hypertext Transport Protocol (“HTTP”). In addition, a Secure HTTP (S-HTTP) or Secure Socket Layers (SSL) may also be utilized between the application layer <b>321</b> and the transport layer <b>322</b> for secure transport of data when HTTP is utilized. S-HTTP is an extension to HTTP that allows the exchange of files with encryption and or digital certificates. SSL only allows authentication from the server where S-HTTP allows the client to send a certificate to authenticate to the user. The routing layer <b>323</b> and the switching layer <b>324</b> enable the data packet to arrive at the address intended.</p>
    <p>In operation the IED monitors the power distribution system for events such as wave shape deviation, sag, swell, kWh, kvA or other power usage, consumption, or power quality events and disturbances. In one embodiment, when the IED detects an event, it process the event and generates an email message using an email client application component for transport over the network to a back end data collection server. Raw data <b>330</b>, such as the error message generated from the IED or a billing signal, is passed into the application layer's <b>321</b> Security Sub-layer <b>321</b> <i>a </i>where it is encrypted before email protocol packaging <b>321</b> <i>b </i>takes place. Once the data <b>330</b> has been encrypted and packaged, the message is passed through the remaining IP layers where the message is configured for transmission and sent to the destination address. In one embodiment, the destination address is for a back end server implementing a data collection application component. This back end server may be operated by the consumer or supplier of electrical power or a third party as described above. In an alternate embodiment the Security Sub-layer <b>321</b> <i>a </i>includes authentication or encryption, or alternately the Security Sub-layer <b>321</b> <i>a </i>is bypassed. The application layer may include application components which implement protocols that are designed to pass through a firewall or other type of software that protects a private network coupled with a publicly accessible network. Multiple redundant data messages may be sent from the IP layer to ensure the complete data packet is received at the destination. In the above operation, the protocol stack, which includes an SMTP or MIME enabled email client, is a scalable, commercial product such as the Eudora™ email client manufactured by Qualcomm, Inc., located in San Diego, Calif. In an alternate embodiment data messages may also be sent to redundant destination email addresses to ensure delivery of the message. Quality of Service (QoS) may also be implemented, depending on the volume of bandwidth required for the data, ensuring reliable and timely delivery of the data. QoS is based on the concept that transmission rates, error rates, and other characteristics of a network can be measured, improved and, to some extent, guaranteed in advance. QoS is a concern for continuous transmission of high-bandwidth information. The power quality events, consumption, disturbances or other usage data may be stored in the IED and sent to the destination address upon request from an application component operating at the destination address, upon pre-determined time intervals and schedules, upon pre-defined events or in real time. In an alternate embodiment a IED may transport data or requests to or receive data or requests from other IED's directly, also know as peer-to-peer communications. Peer-to-peer is a communications model in which each party or device has the same capabilities and either party or device can initiate communication sessions.</p>
    <p>In an alternate embodiment the Security Sub-layer <b>321</b> <i>a </i>may include multiple encryption keys, each conferring different access rights to the device. This enables multiple users, such as a utility and customers, or multiple internal departments of a utility or customer, to send or receive data and commands to or from the IED. For example a customer's IED sends out two encrypted messages, one billing data and one power quality data, to the customer's office site. The billing data message is encrypted at a level where only the internal accounting department has access to decrypt it. The power quality data message is encrypted at a different level where the entire company can decrypt the message. Furthermore, in the preferred embodiment, commands sent to or from the IED are coupled with the appropriate encryption key. For example, the IED's Security Sub-layer <b>321</b> <i>a </i>may only permit billing reset commands to be received and processed if the command has been authenticated where the point of origin was the appropriate customer or utility. Further, encrypted email messages may also include various encrypted portions, each accessible and readable with a different encryption key. For example an IED sends out one message to both the utility and the customer containing billing data and power quality data. The data is encrypted with two different encryption keys so only the utility can decrypt the power quality data and only the customer can decrypt the billing data.</p>
    <p>In operation the IED monitors the power distribution system <b>301</b> for billing events such as, kWh or kvA pulses. In one embodiment the IED may store billing events and transport the data to the power management application components operating on a back end server either upon request or upon pre-determined time intervals. Alternately the IED may transport billing event data in real time to the back end server. Data may he filtered through the either the Back End Server's or IED's power management components or any combination or variation thereof, before being entered into the Billing/Revenue Management component where billing, revenue, cost and usage tracking are computed into revised data. The Billing/Revenue Management components either stores the computations for future retrieval or pushes the revised data to the appropriate party, such as the consumer or provider of the electric power system. Data can be retrieved upon command or sent or requested upon a scheduled time.</p>
    <p>In the preferred embodiment the back end server's operate in a similar approach to the IED's. The back end server contains a transport protocol stack and power management application components. Alternatively, a back end server could be a function or component of the IED, i.e., implemented as an application component.</p>
    <p>The IED <b>402</b> implements power management functions on the whole electrical power distribution system <b>400</b> or just a portion thereof. Referring to FIG. 4<i>a </i>the IED <b>402</b> monitors the electrical power via the system <b>400</b> to a load <b>401</b> and reports events and data to the power management application components <b>411</b> through the network <b>410</b>. The power management application components <b>411</b> are preferably operating on a back end server. The events and data are collected and processed through the automated meter reading components, billing/revenue management components or a combination and variation thereof, and revised data or commands are sent back to the IED through the network <b>410</b>, enabling control of the power flow and distribution of the loading on the power distribution system. The automated meter reading component allows for retrieval and collection of data for the customer, utility or third party. The component further allows for schedule driven, event driven or polling commands which are operable to push data onto the network.</p>
    <p>The power management functions implemented by the IED's enables the back end servers or IED's to control power flow and distribution over the electrical power distribution system. Specifically the power management application components process power measurement data and generate power measurement and reporting commands, transmitting them to the back end servers or IED's for execution. Referring now to FIG. 4<i>b</i>, in one preferred operation a load is monitored by a IED where kvA and kWh pulse data are sent in real time over the network <b>424</b> to the Application via email or another transport protocol. If pre-processing is required <b>425</b> <i>a </i>the raw pulse data is transported into a data collection server or component where it is translated into a format readable by the billing/revenue management component <b>426</b>. Alternately, the billing/revenue management component may be configured to receive and process data without pre-processing <b>425</b> <i>b</i>. Once sent to the billing/revenue management component <b>428</b> the data is compared and analyzed for usage, consumption or billing revenue ranges against a pre-determined tariff structure <b>432</b> where any anomalies, excess or shortages are reported back to the IED in the form of a command to a power management function which controls the power flow and load distribution accordingly <b>434</b>. The components further contact the required parties, such as the consumer or provider of the load, over the network, forwarding power quality, billing, usage or consumption reports or any power management functions that were required against the set tariff structure.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5<i>a </i>illustrates a preferred embodiment for a usage and consumption management application of the power management architecture. The IED <b>502</b> implements a power management function of controlling the source of electrical power for the load <b>501</b> from either energy supplier <b>1</b> <b>505</b> or energy supplier <b>2</b> <b>506</b>. The application is designed to take advantage a deregulated marketplace and operate the load <b>501</b> from the most cost efficient energy supplier at the given time period. Which supplier is most efficient may fluctuate frequently as a function of the energy market and supply and demand for electrical power. Referring to FIG. 5<i>b</i>, the IED <b>502</b> contains a usage and consumption management component which receives tariff and cost structures from multiple energy suppliers <b>505</b>, <b>506</b>. The component receives usage and consumption from the Load <b>501</b> and compares actual usage against multiple tariff structures choosing the most cost effective provider for a given load. Similarly the load management component <b>259</b>, as shown in FIG. 2<i>b</i>, is utilized to connect and disconnect loads to and from the electrical distribution system during either low and high rate and demand periods, hence reducing the electrical power costs and demand. In the preferred embodiment the load management component <b>250</b> is programmed to run in an automated fashion based on feedback from the system, however in an alternate embodiment the component is operated manually based on user input.</p>
    <p>For example, an IED <b>502</b> is connected to a power line <b>500</b> and associated load <b>501</b>. The IED <b>502</b> measures power usage by the load and transmits this consumption data <b>514</b> over a network <b>510</b> to a usage and consumption management application component operating on a back end server <b>511</b>. The Usage and consumption management component receives and tracks cost and usage <b>516</b>, <b>518</b> and compares rates for actual usage against multiple suppliers bids <b>522</b>. Suppliers have the option to either push tariff structures to the application component or have tariff structures polled over the network. Once the most cost effective structure is determined by the usage and consumption management component, a command or function is sent to the IED <b>502</b> with the new tariff structure <b>523</b>, <b>524</b>. Alternately, the new tariff structure is applied across to the billing/revenue management component where billing is applied to the usage and revenue reports are forwarded onto the appropriate parties.</p>
    <p>In another example the usage and consumption management component determines all suppliers tariff structures are too expensive to warrant usage or consumption thus a command to reduce consumption to a desired level is transmitted over the network to the IED <b>525</b>. Furthermore, an alternate embodiment includes application of real-time usage and cost monitoring of loads being measured by an IED and multiple energy and distribution system suppliers.</p>
    <p>In an alternate embodiment the usage and consumption component is pre-programmed to monitor and shed loads based on a exceeding a set tariff structure. For example an IED <b>502</b> monitors a load <b>501</b> connected to a power distribution system <b>500</b>. Energy is supplied by an energy supplier <b>505</b>. The IED contains a tariff structure that has a limit of $0.80/kWh during peak hours of 6 am to 6 pm and a limit of $0.60/kWh for non-peak hours of 6 pm to 6 am. The IED <b>502</b> monitors the power usage of the load <b>501</b> vs. the actual tariff structure of the energy supplier and shuts the load <b>501</b> off if the actual tariff exceeds the limits of $0.80/kWh during peak times or $0.60/kWh during non-peak times.</p>
    <p>The centralized power management component <b>255</b> allows the centralization of work at one location, such as a centralized billing server, load management server or master IED, which collects and processes data from various devices spread over the network. In operation, remote IED's connected to the network transmit data to the centralized power management component where operations such as billing, load management, usage and consumption reporting are processed in one central location.</p>
    <p>The distributed power management component <b>254</b> allows for the distribution of work or data processing to various devices on the network. In operation, an IED measures or detects an occurring or impending catastrophic power quality event and alerts other downstream IED's (on the power distribution network) of the event thereby giving the downstream IED's an opportunity to disconnect or alter loads before the event reaches the downstream system and causes damage. The component further includes a function that, upon detection of an occurring or impending event, alerts downstream IED's or back end servers to alert their connected loads to either protect themselves from the outage by shutting down, or instructing them to shut down applications that may cause critical failure or damage if interrupted, such as writing to a hard-drive. FIG. 6 illustrates a preferred embodiment of the distributed power management component in action. An Electrical power distribution system <b>600</b> distributes energy over distribution lines <b>601</b> which are connected to multiple IED's <b>620</b>, <b>622</b>, <b>624</b>, <b>626</b> which are present to continuously monitor the energy being fed onto their respective loads <b>621</b> <b>623</b> and generators <b>625</b> <b>627</b> on a given branch and furthermore all IED's <b>620</b>, <b>622</b>, <b>624</b>, <b>626</b> are connected via a network <b>610</b> as described above. IED's <b>616</b> <b>618</b> are also present on the distribution system <b>600</b> to continuously monitor energy being transferred onto the system as a whole. It will be appreciated that the loads and generators may reside on multiple or separate consumer sites. In operation, a catastrophic power quality event is detected on a load <b>623</b> by the attached IED <b>622</b>. The IED <b>622</b> takes appropriate action, such as triggering a protection relay, on the load and further transmits communications of its actions to upstream IED's <b>616</b> <b>618</b>. This ensures local containment of the event by the IED <b>622</b> informing upstream IED's to not duplicate the action on the larger system. Obviously retaining upstream IED's as a backup is not discounted in this operation. Alternatively, the operation is utilized to coordinate downstream IED's over the network <b>610</b>. For example an event may be detected at the distribution system <b>600</b> by an IED <b>616</b> monitoring the system <b>600</b> which triggers, for example, a protection relay. The IED <b>616</b> which triggered the protection relay communicates its actions to downstream IED's <b>618</b> <b>620</b> <b>622</b> <b>624</b> <b>626</b> over the network <b>610</b> allowing them to take appropriate intelligent action, such as disconnection the generators <b>625</b> <b>627</b>. It can be appreciated that IED applications may include a combination of the centralized and distributed power management components.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, a power reliability component <b>256</b> is provided in the IED to measure and compute the reliability of the power system. Power system reliability is discussed in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/749,129, “APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR MEASURING AND REPORTING THE RELIABILITY OF A POWER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM”, captioned above. In the preferred embodiment the component <b>256</b> computes and measures reliability as a number of “nines” measure. The component includes a function which compiles the reliability of the power from other components located on back end servers or IED's, giving a total reliability. This function also enables a user to determine which part of the distribution system has the most unreliable power. Knowing this enables the user to focus on the unreliable area, hopefully improving local power reliability and thus increasing overall reliability.</p>
    <p>For example, referring now to FIG. 7, an IED <b>711</b> is connected to a network <b>710</b> and measures the reliability of the power distribution system <b>701</b> which supplies power to loads <b>724</b> <b>726</b> within a customer site <b>705</b>. The customer also provides a generator <b>726</b> which supplies power to the loads <b>722</b> <b>724</b> at various times. The customer measures the power reliability of the system for the load <b>722</b> <b>724</b> using the associated IED <b>712</b> <b>714</b> and considers it unreliable. One IED's <b>714</b> power reliability component polls the other IED's <b>711</b> <b>712</b> <b>716</b> and determines the unreliable power source is coming from the generator <b>726</b>. From this the customer can decide to shut off the power supply from the generator <b>726</b> in order to improve the power reliability of the system.</p>
    <p>In another embodiment, a power outage component <b>265</b> is provided in the IED which informs the appropriate parties of a power outage using email or other transport protocols. In the preferred embodiment an IED is connected to a power system when a power failure occurs. The IED's power outage component <b>265</b> contains hardware, such as a battery backup and modem, which enables the IED to transmit a power failure warning to the appropriate parties, such as the utility or customer, such as by email over a network as described above. Further, a cellular modem may be utilized to call out to indicate the location of an outage. Physical locating algorithms such as cellular triangulation or telephone caller ID can be used to track or verify outage locations.</p>
    <p>Peer to peer communications between IED's and between back end servers are supported by the peer to peer management component <b>257</b>. In the preferred embodiment peer to peer communications are utilized to transport or compile data from multiple IED's. For example, as shown in FIG. 8, an IED <b>800</b> is connected to a network <b>810</b>. Multiple loads <b>806</b> <b>808</b> draw power from a power utility's <b>803</b> power distribution line <b>801</b> and each load is monitored by an IED <b>804</b> <b>806</b>. An IED <b>800</b> polls load and billing data from all other IED's on the network on the customer site <b>802</b> <b>804</b>. Upon request, the IED <b>800</b> then transmits the load and billing data to the customer's billing server <b>814</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the IED <b>800</b> communicates the load and billing data in a format which allows software programs inside the customer billing server <b>814</b> to receive the data directly without translation or reformatting.</p>
    <p>Transmission of data in XML format allows a user to receive the data in a readable self-describing format for the application intended. For example, traditional data file formats include comma-separated value files (CSV), which contain values in tables as a series of ASCII text strings organized so each column value is separated by a comma from the next column's value. The problem with sending CSV file formats is the recipient may not be aware of each column's desired meaning. For example, a CSV file may contain the following information sent from a revenue billing application</p>
    <p>45.54,1.25,1234 Elm Street, 8500</p>
    <p>where 45.54 is the kWh used this month, 1.25 is the kWh used today, 1234 Elm Street is the location of the device and 8500 is the type of device. However, if the recipient of the CSV file was not aware of the data format, the data could be misinterpreted. A file transported in XML is transmitted in HTML tag type format and includes information that allows a user or computer to understand the data contained within the tags. XML allows for an unlimited number of tags to be defined, hence allowing the information to be self-describing instead of having to conform to existing tags. The same information is transmitted in XML format as:</p>
    <p>&lt;billing[ ]<sub>=</sub>information&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;kWh[ ]<sub>=</sub>month&gt;45.54&lt;/kWh[ ]<sub>=</sub>month&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;kWh[ ]<sub>=</sub>day&gt;1.25&lt;/kWh[ ]<sub>=</sub>day&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;location&gt;1234 Elm Street&lt;/location&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;device[ ]<sub>=</sub>type&gt;8500&lt;/device[ ]<sub>=</sub>type&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;/billing[ ]<sub>=</sub>information&gt;</p>
    <p>Transmission in XML format allows the recipient to receive XML-tagged data from a sender and not require knowledge of how the sender's system operates or data formats are organized. In a preferred embodiment communications between IED's connected to the network are transmitted in XML format. An IED utilizes XML based client application components included within the power management applications and transmits the data in XML format so little or no post-processing is required. FIG. 9 illustrates an example of the preferred embodiment. An IED <b>902</b> is connected to a power distribution line <b>900</b> and associated load <b>901</b> owned by a customer <b>920</b>. Power is supplied by a power utility's <b>908</b> power generator <b>903</b>. The power utility also has a utility billing server <b>906</b> which compiles billing data from consumers drawing power from their power generators. The IED <b>902</b> is connected to the utility billing server via a network connection <b>910</b> and the IED <b>902</b> measures usage and consumption of the load, and other values associated with billing. The utility billing server <b>906</b> contains billing software, such as a MV90, which requires data in a specified format. Either upon request, or a pre-scheduled times, the IED <b>902</b> transmits the usage, consumption and billing data associated with the load <b>901</b> to the utility billing server <b>906</b> in XML format. The customer also has a monitoring server <b>921</b> which is dedicated to receiving billing data from the IED <b>902</b> and reporting usage and consumption to the appropriate parties, the monitoring server <b>921</b> also reads data in a specified format for its associated monitoring software. The IED <b>902</b> transmits the same usage, consumption and billing data to the monitoring server <b>921</b> in XML format. By utilizing XML data formats the data transmitted by the IED <b>902</b> can be read by multiple servers or IED's <b>902</b> that do not require knowledge beforehand of the order or type of data that is being sent. In an alternate embodiment an IED <b>902</b> may also receive inputs from peripheral devices which may be translated and combined in the XML transmission. For example, the load <b>901</b> is a motor which contains a temperature probe. The temperature probe is connected to the IED <b>902</b> and allows the IED <b>902</b> to monitor the motor temperature in addition to power data on the power distribution line <b>900</b>. The IED <b>902</b> is programmed to act on the temperature input by shutting down the motor if the temperature exceeds a pre-defined critical level by tripping a relay or other protection device (not shown). The IED <b>902</b> is further programmed to alert the customer monitoring server <b>921</b> and an alert pager <b>922</b> and if such an action takes place. This alert transmission is sent in XML format so both the server <b>921</b> and the pager <b>922</b>, which may be configured to read incoming transmissions differently, receive the alert transmission in the form it was intended. It can be appreciated that the IED <b>902</b> can receive data in XML format from multiple sources without complete knowledge of their file transfer notations.</p>
    <p>In an alternate embodiment the back end servers include software that is generally included on a majority of existing computer systems, such as Microsoft Office™ software, manufactured by Microsoft Corporation, located in Redmond, Wash. which includes the software applications Microsoft Word™ and Microsoft Excel™. The software receives data in a self describing format, such as XML, and the software includes off the shelf applications and processes such as a Microsoft Exchange Server, Microsoft Excel and associated Excel Workbooks, Microsoft Outlook and associated Outlook rules, Microsoft Visio and associated Visio Stencils, Template files, and macros which allow the user to view and manipulate data directly from the IED. In one embodiment the IED transmission format makes use of existing standard software packages and does not require additional low level components, such as a communications server communicating with a serial port, which are normally required to interface to the IED communication ports. Further, the embodiment does not require a separate database, as the data is stored in the software programs. This allows a user to view data from the IED using standard computer software. For example, referring now to FIG. 10, an IED <b>1002</b> monitors a load <b>1001</b> and passes the monitored data to a monitoring server <b>1011</b>. The data can be transmitted using a variety of protocols, such as FTP, TCP/IP or HTTP, as described above. In the preferred embodiment data is transmitted in an HTTP based form or an SMTP form where the HTTP form is a self-describing format such as XML and the SMTP format is an email message. The monitoring server <b>1011</b> includes Microsoft Exchange Server <b>1022</b>, Visio <b>1021</b>, Microsoft Excel <b>1020</b> and Excel Workbooks <b>1023</b>. The Excel software <b>1020</b> is capable of receiving data directly from the IED in a self-describing format, thus allowing the user to view real time load profiles or graphs and other monitored data directly from the IED in real time. The Visio software <b>1021</b> is also capable of receiving data directly from the IED in a self-describing format, thus allowing the user to process and view real time data in Visio format. Alternately, the IED transmits power quality, load, billing data or other measured or monitored values to the Excel Workbooks <b>1023</b> via the Exchange Server <b>1022</b>. The Excel or Visio software is then capable of retrieving historical data directly from the workbooks.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 11, there is shown an exemplary screen display of a Microsoft Excel worksheet which is coupled with the IED <b>1002</b> as described above. In this example, the IED <b>1002</b> is a model <b>8500</b> meter, manufactured by Power Measurement Limited, in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. The IED <b>1002</b> is coupled via a TCP/IP based network with a personal computer having at least 64 MB memory and 6 GB hard disk with a Pentium™ III or equivalent processor or better, executing the Microsoft Windows 98™ operating system and Microsoft Excel 2000. The computer further includes Microsoft Internet Explorer™ 5.0 which includes an XML parser that receives and parses the XML data fro the meter and delivers it to the Excel worksheet. The worksheet displays real time data received directly from the IED <b>1002</b> in an XML format. As the IED <b>1002</b> detects and measures fluctuations in the delivered electrical power, it transmits updated information, via XML, to the worksheet which, in turn, updates the displayed data in real time. Note that all of the features of the Microsoft Excel program are available to manipulate and analyze the received real time data, including the ability to specify mathematical formulas and complex equations which act on the data. Further, display templates and charting/graphing functions can be implemented to provide meaningful visual analysis of the data as it is received. Further, the real time data can be logged for historical analysis. In one embodiment, the activation of a new IED <b>1002</b> on the network is detected by the worksheet which cause automatic generation of a new worksheet to receive and display data from the new device.</p>
    <p>In still another alternative embodiment, the ability to communicate through a firewall or other private network security/protection implementations, as described above, also known as “punch through”, is provided. As was described, in order to implement the various power management applications on the disclosed power management architecture, the IED's, back-end servers and their constituent application components must be able to intercommunicate with and among one another to share data and command and control information. Further, as was noted, the IED's, back-end servers and their constituent application components may be located anywhere, including within private internal networks, relying on the fabric of the public network infrastructure to link them together and facilitate their “machine to machine” communications. However, concerns over enterprise network security often result in the restriction of such communications between private/internal networks and public external networks such as the Internet. Unfettered communications over unknown or unregulated protocols or between unknown or unregulated clients, servers or hosts represent an inherent network security risk to an enterprise. As will be discussed below, it is therefore advantageous to encapsulate/facilitate these computer readable communications using protocols intended for human readable communications, such as electronic mail, hypertext/web or instant messaging protocols, which are more benign and more easily regulated and monitored, i.e. trusted.</p>
    <p>A firewall is a software program, or combination of software and hardware, typically located on a network, that protects the resources of a private network, such as an intranet, from users of other external networks, such as the Internet, coupled with that private network. The firewall within an internal network, or intranet, allows internal users access to the intranet but prevents outsiders from accessing the private data, and/or it controls which resources both the internal or external users have access to. Alternately, or in conjunction, the firewall restricts outgoing connections to external network entities from the internal user by restricting certain types of protocol connections or data transfers. A firewall mediates/facilitates bi-directional communication between two networks, typically external and internal networks, but in certain situations data or standard communications protocols are only allowed outbound to the external network and not inbound from the external network. Alternately, select standard protocols are enabled for both inbound and outbound communication. Standard communication protocols include FTP, NNTP or instant messaging protocols, such as AOL™, Yahoo!™ or MSN™ instant messaging protocols. It may also include SMTP (port 25) type protocols known in the art or other HTTP (port 80) type protocols. It will be appreciated that firewalls are well known in the art.</p>
    <p>A firewall examines each network packet to determine whether to forward it towards its destination. A firewall may also include or work with a proxy server that makes external network requests on behalf on internal users. The proxy server allows an enterprise, which has several users, to act as an intermediary between the users and the external network/internet so the Enterprise, such as a company's Information Services department, can ensure security, administrative control and/or offer caching services.</p>
    <p>The firewall also acts as a screening method. For example, a firewall may screen requests to ensure they come from acceptable domain names or Internet protocol addresses. Further, the firewall may also allow remote access into the private or internal network by the use of secure login procedures and authentication certificates. The term firewall typically implies not only that firewall network hardware and software is installed but also that a security policy is in place. The security policy refers to the configuration of the firewall as to which internal and external entities are permitted to communicate. Typically this includes defining which communications protocols will be allowed to pass through and which computer systems or hosts, internal and external, will be allowed to communicate via those protocols. Such security policies are typically implemented by the Information Technology/Services (IT or IS) departments of the enterprise.</p>
    <p>Typical enterprises implement internal or local area networks for at least the purpose of allowing employees to communicate via electronic mail. Further, these mail servers are typically configured, along with the firewall, to permit the exchange of electronic mail with entities outside the enterprise. Mail servers may also act as a similar screening method to restrict messages or access only to acceptable services or from acceptable users. For example, a mail server may screen incoming messages to ensure that they come from acceptable or valid domain names, Internet protocol addresses or even specific user addresses. In one embodiment a mail server may be instructed to only receive messages from a single user address, such as ied_data@company.com, or a valid domain @company.com. Further, the mail server typically must also be configured for each user or email client program that wishes to communicate using the server. For example, an email account must be set up for each user within the enterprise who is to be allowed to communicate via email.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment disclosed herein, the IED is configured as an email client with the email server and appears to the email server as any other user of email within the enterprise, creating, sending and receiving emails via the server. These emails contain the computer readable power management data and commands to other application components within the power management application which are capable of receiving the email and parsing out the power management data or commands. The IED may be configured to define or set any outgoing message criteria/parameters or to conform its communications to the user or enterprise domain address to ensure the mail server will accept any messages the IED sends from the valid domain. In this way, the IED can take advantage of the email server's capability to communicate via the firewall to get messages out to the external network.</p>
    <p>As described above, the ability of an IED to push or send data or commands using the public Internet infrastructure allows IED's to be easily scalable when implemented in a network type architecture. By using the existing resources of the enterprise in which the IED is installed, including the internal/local area network and its connection with the external network/Internet, the need for dedicated communications media, such a telephone line, is eliminated. However, this ability to communicate requires that the data be able to get out of the internal/private network and to the external public network or Internet. As discussed above, with the advent of network security, this requires that the IED be able to send and receive its communications through the firewall. Sending data or commands, such as power management commands described earlier, using a protocol such as SMTP enabled email clients, allows a user or IED to communicate through a firewall while meeting the demands for security by the enterprise. However, due to various security policies, discussed above, the enterprise's internal network must be configured, in most cases, to allow such communication.</p>
    <p>One method, as discussed above, is to configure the IED as an email client on the enterprise's internal electronic mail server, where that server is capable of communicating electronic mail via the firewall. In this case, the TED appears as any other user of the email server and is able to send and receive email via the firewall. The IED need only be configured to correctly interact with the mail server. In another embodiment, the IED is configured to interact with a communications server, such as an electronic mail server or XML server, which is external to the enterprise's internal network. In this case, the security policy of the enterprise may need to be reconfigured to allow the firewall to pass the communications of the IED to an external communications server such as an external mail server or external XML server. As will be discussed, in still another embodiment, the IED is configured to utilize a standard protocol typically already permitted by the enterprise's security policy for communications via the firewall, such as the HTTP protocol. In this case, no reconfiguration of the enterprise's internal network is required for the IED to communicate via the firewall.</p>
    <p>In order to interact via electronic mail, whether with an internal or external mail server, the IED includes an electronic mail client application, as described above. It will be appreciated, that depending on the protocol and method of communications, the IED is equipped with an appropriately enabled client application, as described above. An exemplary SMTP enabled email client for IED's is the MeterM@il™ email client manufactured by Power Measurement, Ltd, located in Saanichton, B.C. Canada. Other protocols, such as Multi-Purpose Internet Mail Extensions (“MIME”) may also be used to transport data or commands.</p>
    <p>As described earlier in FIG. 3<i>c</i>, a security sub-layer <b>321</b> <i>a </i>is present on the application layer <b>321</b> where encryption before email protocol packaging takes place. In an alternate embodiment a secure sockets layer (“SSL”) is utilized to ensure security between the IED and the server or client which it ultimately connects to. SSL is a commonly-used protocol for managing the security of a message transmission. In the preferred embodiment, the SSL is included on the application layer <b>321</b>, which includes all of the application software component and/or power management components. SSL uses public-and-private key encryption, which also includes the use of digital certificates. Digital certificates allow the recipient to verify that the certificate is real, and hence the message is real and from an authorized user. As described earlier, encryption can also be done utilizing Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). PGP uses a variation of the public key system, where each user has a publicly known encryption key and a private key known only to that user. The public key system and infrastructure enables users of unsecured networks, such as the Internet, to securely and privately exchange data through the use of public and private cryptographic key pairs. A security module, or security application, includes the aforementioned encryption, authentication and encryption applications.</p>
    <p>In an alternate embodiment a Network Time Protocol (“NTP”) or other form of time-syncing is utilized on the IED to ensure the transferred message has the correct time and to ensure that the contents of the message is derived using accurate time (i.e., interval energy data). NTP is a protocol that is used to synchronize computer or IED clock times in a network, either external or internal. Accurate time across the network is important. Distributed procedures depend on coordinated times to ensure proper sequences are followed or security mechanisms depend on coordinated times across the network. For example, a supplier may initiate a startup of two generators, each connected to an IED. In order to achieve proper startup, the first and second generator must be started in the correct order within a specified period of time. The supplier sends a command to start the first generator at 12:00 AM and the second generator at 12:01 AM. In order to ensure the proper startup sequence is done, both the IED's must be timesynced together. As one can see, if one of the IED's has the incorrect internal time the procedure may not occur in the correct order. Further, correct time stamping of messages is important for real time or revenue related messages. NTP typically applies to both the protocol and the client/server programs that may run on the IED. In one embodiment, the IED NTP initiates a request to the network time server, internal or external. Alternately, the IED may receive the correct time to timesync the IED from the time server via a push mechanism.</p>
    <p>FIG. 12 shows an example of a networked architecture with firewalls. A firewall <b>1220</b> defines the internal network <b>1202</b>, which comprises an intranet <b>1210</b> with IED's <b>1212</b> <b>1214</b> coupled with the intranet <b>1210</b>. The IED's <b>1212</b> <b>1214</b> may be in turn connected to loads or generators or other devices requiring power management or other power measurement data. It can be appreciated that loads or generators, such as fuel cells, turbines or flywheels, may be coupled with other types of power systems beyond electricity systems, such as power and gas. As described earlier power management data includes any data or information utilized or created by an IED, such as a status information, load information or electricity information used by an energy enterprise that may used in reporting or commanding or communicating to, with or from an IED. A database <b>1254</b> is connected to a server <b>1252</b>, which may include a mail server such as Microsoft Exchange™, which is in turn connected to the Internet <b>1250</b>. The network connections shown allow the server <b>1252</b> to connect to the IED <b>1212</b>. In an alternate embodiment, the external network <b>1204</b> contains another firewall <b>1225</b> thereby defining another internal network which houses the server <b>1252</b> and the database <b>1254</b>. The use of a firewall allows security to be present so the IED's <b>1212</b> <b>1214</b> located in the internal network <b>1202</b>, or internal Ethernet network, are protected from unauthorized access, and may restrict communications to other unauthorized sites or locations. For example the IED <b>1212</b> may contain billing or other revenue certified data which is required to be sent to the database <b>1254</b>, which is located outside the secure firewall. The security contained in the firewall prohibits unauthorized users from collecting or viewing the billing data. The IED <b>1212</b> pushes or sends billing data on a scheduled or event driven basis by packaging the billing data in an email message, which utilizes an SMTP protocol. The email message is sent through the firewall <b>1220</b> to the server <b>1252</b>, which processes the data and forwards it onto the database <b>1254</b>. It will be appreciated that increased security, such as email encryption and authentication as described earlier may be utilized to further prevent unauthorized access to the billing data while in transport across the Internet <b>1250</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 13, Customer A <b>1305</b> contains an internal network <b>1310</b> with various IED's <b>1312</b> <b>1314</b> connected to the network <b>1310</b>. A firewall <b>1320</b> protects the internal network <b>1310</b> from users which may attempt to access the IED's <b>1312</b> <b>1314</b> or other network resources through the Internet <b>1350</b>, or via some other type of external network connection. Customer B <b>1306</b> also contains an internal network <b>1326</b> with an IED <b>1322</b> connected to a transport box <b>1324</b>, the transport box <b>1324</b>, described in more detail below, is connected to the network. The internal network <b>1326</b> also contains a firewall <b>1330</b> which protects the internal network from unauthorized users or access. An Enterprise <b>1360</b> has a server <b>1352</b> and a database <b>1354</b> which are utilized to receive data from both Customer A <b>1305</b> and Customer B <b>1306</b>. This data, such as revenue billing data, or other power management data, is packaged by the respective IED <b>1314</b> on the respective internal network and sent using a SMTP protocol through the firewall <b>1320</b> to the server <b>1352</b>. The server <b>1352</b> contains a mail server, such as Microsoft Exchange™ which receives and processes the data sent. The Enterprise <b>1360</b> has a database <b>1354</b> which compiles the data sent by the respective Customers <b>1305</b> <b>1306</b>. Further, it will be appreciated that the Server <b>1352</b> can also send a command or data packet to the IED <b>1312</b> using the same protocol.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment the transport box <b>1324</b> allows an IED <b>1322</b>, which does not have the ability to either directly connect to the network <b>1326</b> or the ability to use an email transport protocol, to connect to the Enterprise <b>1360</b>. The IED, such as an electro-mechanical watt-hour meter, gives an output pulse, or other form of output data, to the transport box <b>1324</b>, which is equal to a pre-defined measurement such as a kWh. In turn the transport box <b>1324</b> contains the ability to compile and translate the pulses or other output data from the IED <b>1322</b> into data, such as billing data, and package and push or send the data on either a pre-defined schedule, or an event driven schedule, to the Enterprise <b>1360</b>. For example the IED <b>1322</b> emits a pulse to the transport box for every kWh measured. The transport box <b>1324</b> is programmed to push revenue billing data, as measured by the IED <b>1322</b>, on a weekly or other scheduled basis to the Enterprise <b>1360</b>. The transport box compiles the pulses, as sent by the IED <b>1322</b>, into an email message containing the data, encrypts the data, and sends the message through the firewall <b>1330</b> to the Enterprise <b>1360</b>. The Server <b>1352</b> receives the message from the transport box <b>1324</b> and decrypts and authenticates the message before sending the data to the database <b>1354</b>. The database is then utilized to provide billing to Customer B <b>1306</b> on a monthly basis. The use of a firewall <b>1330</b> ensures that an unauthorized user, such as Customer A may not access or alter the billing data contained in the transport box <b>1324</b>. In an alternate embodiment the transport box contains a data converter engine, such as an extensible markup language (“XML”) Engine, to convert the billing data into a pre-defined or readable data format, such as XML or Comma Separated Values (“CSV”).</p>
    <p>Further, in an alternate embodiment, the Enterprise <b>1360</b>, may contact the Customer to enable a power management command, such as shed a load, on a load or device connected to an IED <b>1314</b>. In operation a power management command is created or sent to the Server <b>1352</b> and the corresponding “shed load” command is packaged in an email protocol, such as SMTP, and sent to the IED <b>1314</b>. A power management command may be included or reside in power management data. The use of an email message allows the Enterprise <b>1360</b> to transmit information through the firewall <b>1320</b>. It can be appreciated that other transport protocols to transmit information through the firewall can be utilized, such as HTTP, HTTP Tunneling, SOAP™ or instant messaging.</p>
    <p>In an alternate embodiment the transport box is utilized to allow bi-directional communication through the firewall between the IED <b>1322</b> and the Enterprise <b>1360</b>. The Server <b>1352</b> sends an email message through the Internet <b>1350</b>, the firewall <b>1330</b> to the transport box <b>1324</b>, addressed to the IED <b>1322</b>. The transport box <b>1324</b>, which contains a mail server, such as Microsoft Exchange™, receives and temporarily stores the email message for pickup from the IED <b>1322</b>. Alternatively, the Mail Server <b>1328</b> may be external from the transport box <b>1324</b>. Upon pickup, the IED <b>1322</b> can extract, process, permanently store the message and take any necessary action the message may have included. This “store and forward” capability of the mail server <b>1328</b> allows the IED <b>1322</b> to only connect to the Mail Server <b>1328</b> or Transport Box <b>1324</b> while the corresponding message is held for retrieval. It can be appreciated that although the IED <b>1322</b> has the ability to connect to the network but for reasons such as security utilizes the transport box <b>1324</b> or mail server <b>1328</b> as a way to connect to the network and send messages either in one direction or bi-directional as described.</p>
    <p>FIG. 14 illustrates an alternate embodiment where the Mail Server <b>1452</b> is located on the external network. Customer C <b>1405</b> comprises an internal network <b>1410</b> with an IED <b>1412</b> and an internal mail server <b>1416</b> connected to the network <b>1410</b>. A firewall <b>1420</b> protects the internal network <b>1410</b> from users which may attempt to access the IED <b>1412</b> via the Internet <b>1450</b>, or some other type of external network connection. An Enterprise <b>1460</b> has an enterprise mail server <b>1452</b> and a database <b>1454</b> which are utilized to send or receive data or commands to or from Customer C <b>1405</b>. In one embodiment a message is sent to the IED <b>1412</b>. In operation, the message from the Enterprise <b>1460</b> is received and stored in the internal mail server <b>1416</b>, and the IED <b>1412</b> contacts the internal mail server <b>1416</b> periodically to check for messages. If a message is found on the internal mail server <b>1416</b> for the IED <b>1412</b> in question, the IED <b>1412</b> retrieves the message and acts or responds accordingly. In a second embodiment the message is received and stored in the external mail server <b>1452</b>. This mail server <b>1452</b>, which is located outside the firewall <b>1420</b>, also stores the message for the IED <b>1412</b> until the IED <b>1412</b> retrieves the message and acts or responds accordingly. It can be appreciated that the IED connects to the internal mail server <b>1416</b> or the external mail server <b>1452</b>, which ever is utilized by the Customer <b>1405</b>, using protocols known in the art such as POP3 or Internet Message Access Protocol 4 (“IMAP”).</p>
    <p>In another embodiment authentication and encryption of the email message is performed to ensure that the email is not erroneously received by another IED <b>1312</b> and the command is conducted on the correct load or application. In another embodiment a proxy server is located on the internal network however, in alternate embodiments, the IED may contain a proxy server which can also act as a filter to protect the IED from contacting or connecting to unauthorized sites. Further, it can be appreciated that the IED may have the ability to communicate to the internet <b>1250</b> via a proxy server. In another embodiment the IED itself may contain a firewall to secure access as described above.</p>
    <p>With the inherent insecurity of publicly accessible external networks such as the Internet, private enterprises implementing internal local area networks, such as Intranets, must take precautions. While the safest alternative to prevent hacking, information theft, corporate espionage and other security breaches is to completely disconnect the internal network from external network, this solution also shuts out the tremendous benefits of having access to such external networks, some which have been explained above. Therefore, network security devices and policies, such as firewalls, must be implemented to safeguard the internal network while maintaining communication with the outside world. Automated power management applications operating on the disclosed power management architecture, as described above, must deal with this reality and respect the enterprise's need for network security while employing the intra-application component communications which span the internal and external networks to implement the power management application.</p>
    <p>The disclosed embodiments meet these needs by providing a system and method for communicating through a firewall that takes advantage of the existing network infrastructure of the enterprise without jeopardizing the security of that infrastructure. The disclosed embodiments do not require a dedicated communications medium such as a telephone line. Each IED is capable of connecting directly to the existing network infrastructure, taking advantage of cabling, routers, switches, hubs, etc. that are already in place. Further, the disclosed embodiments do not require additional layers of data collection. Each IED is a standalone device capable of communicating with the back end servers or other data collection system within the power management architecture. Additional dedicated intermediary devices are not necessary to collect the power management data for the purpose of communicating it over the internal network. Further, each IED is capable of initiating communications, either according to a schedule, or as power management events are detected on the monitored power distribution system. This eliminates the need for in-bound “polling request” communications to the IED to cause it to send its data. By restricting communications to outbound traffic only, the enterprise's network security policies can be respected, and less burden is placed on the enterprise's network security staff in monitoring in bound network traffic from unknown sources.</p>
    <p>As described above, a generally accessible connectionless/scalable communications architecture is provided for operating power management applications. The architecture facilitates IED-supplier communications applications such as for automated meter reading, revenue collection, IED tampering and fraud detection, power quality monitoring, load or generation control, tariff updating or power reliability monitoring. The architecture also supports IED-consumer applications such as usage/cost monitoring, IED tampering and fraud detection, power quality monitoring, power reliability monitoring or control applications such as load shedding/cost control or generation control. In addition, real time deregulated utility/supplier switching applications which respond in real time to energy costs fluctuations can be implemented which automatically switch suppliers based on real time cost. Further the architecture supports communications between IED's such as early warning systems which warn downstream IED's of impending power quality events. The architecture also supports utility/supplier to customer applications such as real time pricing reporting, billing reporting, power quality or power reliability reporting. Customer to customer applications may also be supported wherein customers can share power quality or power reliability data.</p>
    <p>It is therefore intended that the foregoing detailed description be regarded as illustrative rather than limiting, and that it be understood that it is the following claims, including all equivalents, that are intended to define the spirit and scope of this invention.</p>
