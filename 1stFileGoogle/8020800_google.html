    <p num="p-0002">This invention concerns improvements in or relating to mobile rigs and, in particular, to mobile rigs for processing dug mineral in an opencast mine.</p>
    <p num="p-0003">In a typical opencast or surface mining operation, mobile shovels dig up mineral and deposit the dug mineral into dumper trucks. The dumper trucks then transport the dug mineral to a mineral processing plant located in the mine.</p>
    <p num="p-0004">The mineral processing plant breaks down the dug mineral to ensure that it contains no lumps above a desired size, and so enables the processed mineral to be conveyed out of the mine either in a dry state on a conveyor belt or as a slurry in a pipeline.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">Typically the mineral processing plant is a massive structure, which is purpose-built in a specific location, i.e. it is located at a fixed location within the mine.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">The use of a static processing plant in an opencast mine requires the use of a fleet of dumper trucks to transport the dug mineral from the shovels to the processing plant. As mining proceeds, the shovels move further away from the static processing plant. More dumper trucks are therefore required to transport the dug mineral to the processing plant if the same rate of feed to the plant is to be maintained. Eventually an economic point may be reached where it becomes more economical to build a new mineral processing plant at a different location in the mine.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">Furthermore the use of large dumper trucks is becoming less and less attractive both because of the large amounts of fuel they consume while working; and also because there is presently (2007) a worldwide shortage of tyres for the dumper trucks. Even when available the tyres can cost tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">As a result it is desirable to provide a mobile processing rig that is able to move around the mine as mining proceeds. In order to ensure a maximum throughput of processed mineral it is necessary to maintain a continuous supply of dug mineral to the mobile processing rig such that the time it spends idle is reduced to a minimum</p>
    <p num="p-0009">According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a mobile rig, for processing mineral material, comprising a feeder including a feed device for receiving mineral and a feeder conveyor arranged to convey mineral; a main chassis supporting a mineral breaker; and a discharge conveyor, the mineral breaker having an infeed region via which it receives mineral and a discharge region via which it discharges mineral after processing in the mineral breaker, the feeder conveyor being such as to convey mineral from the feed device to the infeed region of the mineral breaker and the discharge conveyor being such as to convey mineral from the discharge region of the mineral breaker, wherein the rig includes a primary transport carriage on which the main chassis is supported.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">The provision of a primary transport carriage effectively enables the rig to form a mineral processing plant for processing mineral in an opencast mine which can be moved from location to location within the mine. This allows the mineral processing plant to be continuously located a relatively short working distance from the shovels, and thereby maintain the need for dumper trucks to a minimum or dispose of them altogether in situations where it is appropriate for the shovels to deposit dug mineral directly into the feed device.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">The main chassis may be supported on the primary transport carriage so as to be pivotable relative to the primary transport carriage to raise and lower the feeder relative to the ground.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">The ability to raise and lower the feeder relative to the ground allows the feeder to be supported on the ground while dug mineral is deposited into the feeder, and selectively spaced from the ground to allow the rig to move to a new digging location.</p>
    <p num="p-0013">Preferably in such embodiments, the feed device, feeder conveyor, main chassis, mineral breaker and discharge conveyor are arranged such that their combined centre of gravity lies over the primary transport carriage throughout the range of pivotal displacement of the main chassis relative to the primary transport carriage.</p>
    <p num="p-0014">Maintaining the centre of gravity over the transport carriage throughout the range of pivotal displacement of the main chassis relative to the primary transport carriage ensures that the rig remains stable while moving to another digging location. As a result the time taken in moving the mobile rig to a new digging location is reduced, thereby minimizing any downtime during which the rig is unable to process mineral.</p>
    <p num="p-0015">The feeder also preferably includes a rigid frame structure projecting downwardly from the chassis such that a lower end of the feeder is lowered to seat on the ground or raised to clear the ground solely by pivoting of the main chassis relative to the primary transport carriage.</p>
    <p num="p-0016">The rigid frame is able to support the feed assembly during loading of the feeder with dug mineral and therefore reduces the likelihood of the rig failing through overloading of the feeder.</p>
    <p num="p-0017">In other embodiments, the rig may include an auxiliary transport carriage arranged to support the feeder conveyor and/or the feed device.</p>
    <p num="p-0018">The provision of an auxiliary transport carriage means that it is not necessary to support the feeder on the ground while mineral is deposited into the feed device. As a consequence it is not necessary to provide for pivotal movement of the main chassis relative to the primary transport carriage.</p>
    <p num="p-0019">The provision of an auxiliary transport carriage also means that the feeder conveyor can be made longer than in prior art rigs and plant without the conveyor being over-stressed in use. This means that at any given time during use the feeder may accommodate a large through put of mineral without the need for e.g. an over-sized hopper at the infeed end of the feeder. As a consequence the feed device may be of an essentially conventional hopper design, which has cost advantages. As a result of the aforesaid arrangement, the feeder is able to receive a large amount of dug mineral from shovels working close by and therefore is able to act as a reservoir of dug mineral. This allows time for the shovels to dig more mineral and load it into the feeder without the supply of dug mineral to a downstream processing element becoming interrupted.</p>
    <p num="p-0020">Optionally the feeder conveyor and/or the feed device are pivotally supported on the auxiliary transport carriage to negotiate ground undulations without significantly altering the orientation of the feeder conveyor and/or the feed device. Self-evidently such an arrangement is beneficial since the floor of an opencast mine is rarely level or flat.</p>
    <p num="p-0021">Such pivotal support may be provided by supporting the feeder conveyor and/or the feed device on the primary transport carriage via a spherical joint mounting.</p>
    <p num="p-0022">Preferably the primary transport carriage includes a pair of parallel, driven, ground-engaging tracks and the rig includes one or more control devices for selectively driving the respective said tracks at different speeds so as to effect steering of the primary transport carriage.</p>
    <p num="p-0023">In such embodiments, the orientation of the ground-engaging tracks relative to the main chassis may be fixed in a transverse direction. This arrangement allows the rig to move alongside the shovels and/or an overland conveyor in a mine whilst maintaining the feeder adjacent the shovels for deposit of dug mineral directly into the feed device, and/or maintaining the discharge region of the discharge conveyor adjacent the overland conveyor for discharge of mineral onto the conveyor.</p>
    <p num="p-0024">In other embodiments where a better turning ability of the rig is required, i.e. spot turning, the main chassis may be rotatably supported on the primary transport carriage to permit rotation of the main chassis relative to the primary transport carriage.</p>
    <p num="p-0025">In embodiments where an auxiliary transport carriage is also provided, the feeder conveyor and/or the feed device are preferably rotatably supported on the auxiliary transport carriage. Such a feature permits operation of the rig in a slewing mode as described below. Conveniently therefore the axes of rotation relative to the respective transport carriages are in use generally vertical.</p>
    <p num="p-0026">In another preferred embodiment of the invention the auxiliary transport carriage includes a pair of parallel, driven, ground-engaging tracks and the rig includes one or more control devices for selectively driving the respective said tracks at different speeds so as to effect rotation of the main chassis relative to the primary transport carriage. Thus the rig may readily by operated in a slewing mode if desired. By “slewing mode” is meant a mode (which may or may not incorporate processing of mineral) in which slewing of the main chassis relative to the primary transport carriage occurs.</p>
    <p num="p-0027">In another preferred embodiment of the invention the rig includes a slewing gear interconnecting the main chassis and the primary transport carriage to effect selective, powered rotation of the main chassis and the primary transport carriage one relative to the other.</p>
    <p num="p-0028">The slewing gear may take any of a range of forms and in one embodiment of the invention includes a slewing rig secured to one of the main chassis and the primary transport carriage; at least one slewing motor that is secured to the other of the main chassis and the primary transport carriage and having an output shaft that is drivingly engaged with the slewing ring. If the slewing gear is present it may not be needed to provide controlled powering of the auxiliary transport carriage for slewing purposes (and vice versa). If the slewing gear is present and the auxiliary transport carriage includes powered or driven tracks the rig may include one or more control devices operatively interconnecting the slewing gear and the auxiliary transport carriage so as to effect co-ordinated rotation of the main chassis relative to the primary transport carriage on the one hand and rotation of the feeder conveyor and/or the feed device relative to the auxiliary transport carriage on the other.</p>
    <p num="p-0029">Preferably in such embodiments the primary transport carriage includes a pair of parallel, driven, ground-engaging tracks and the rig includes one or more control devices for selectively driving the respective said tracks at different speeds so as to effect changes in the orientation of the main chassis relative to the primary transport carriage.</p>
    <p num="p-0030">According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided a mobile rig, for processing mineral material, comprising a feeder including a feed device for receiving mineral and a feeder conveyor arranged to convey mineral; a main chassis supporting a mineral breaker; and a discharge conveyor, the mineral breaker having an infeed region via which it receives mineral and a discharge region via which it discharges mineral after processing in the mineral breaker, the feeder conveyor being such as to convey mineral from the feed device to the infeed region of the mineral breaker and the discharge conveyor being such as so convey mineral from the discharge region of the mineral breaker, wherein the rig includes first and second transport carriages on which the main chassis is supported.</p>
    <p num="p-0031">The provision of first and second transport carriages allows the main chassis to be made longer to support the feeder and the discharge conveyor. This in turn means that the feeder conveyor can be made longer providing the associated advantages outlined above.</p>
    <p num="p-0032">Each of the first and second transport carriages may include a single, driven, ground-engaging track, the first and second transport carriages being arranged in a spaced, parallel configuration and oriented relative to the main chassis in a fixed transverse direction. In such embodiments, the or each single, driven, ground-engaging track may be bolted directly to the main chassis.</p>
    <p num="p-0033">The use of single, driven, ground-engaging tracks provides a relative high load carrying capacity. However such tracks are expensive and relatively time consuming to build. Consequently, in other embodiments, the first and/or second transport carriage may be replaced by a pair of parallel, driven, ground-engaging tracks.</p>
    <p num="p-0034">The use of a pair of parallel, driven, ground-engaging tracks means that each individual track is considerably smaller than the track which would otherwise be required of a single, driven, ground-engaging track carrying the same load. As a consequence the overall cost and time required to build each track is considerably less, thereby rendering the use of a pair of parallel, driven, ground-engaging tracks cheaper than a single, driven, ground-engaging track.</p>
    <p num="p-0035">Regardless of whether the first and/or second transport carriage includes a single, driven, ground-engaging track or a pair of parallel, driven, ground-engaging tracks, in such embodiments the rig preferably includes one or more control devices for selectively driving the transport carriages at different speeds so as to effect steering of the rig.</p>
    <p num="p-0036">In other embodiments, each of the first and second transport carriages may include a pair of parallel, driven, ground-engaging tracks, the main chassis being mounted on each pair of tracks by means of a slewing gear to effect selective, powered rotation of the main chassis and the transport carriage, one relative to the other.</p>
    <p num="p-0037">To improve the stability of the mobile rig, a third transport carriage may be provided, which is spaced from the first transport carriage in a transverse direction across the width of the main chassis.</p>
    <p num="p-0038">In such embodiments, each of the first, second and third transport carriages may include a pair of parallel, driven, ground-engaging tracks, the main chassis being mounted on each pair of tracks by means of a slewing gear to effect selective, powered rotation of the main chassis and the transport carriage, one relative to the other.</p>
    <p num="p-0039">According to a third aspect of the invention there is provided a mobile rig, for processing mineral material, comprising a feeder including a feed device for receiving mineral and a feeder conveyor arranged to convey mineral; a main chassis supporting a mineral breaker; and a discharge conveyor, the mineral breaker having an infeed region via which it receives mineral and a discharge region via which it discharged mineral after processing in the mineral breaker, the feeder conveyor being such as to convey mineral from the feed device to the infeed region of the mineral breaker and the discharge conveyor being such as to convey mineral from the discharge region of the mineral breaker, wherein the rig includes first and second transport carriages on which the main chassis is supported, the first transport carriage including a single, driven, ground-engaging track and the second transport carriage including one or more driven, ground-engaging tracks, the ground-engaging tracks being arranged in a spaced, parallel configuration and oriented relative to the main chassis in a fixed transverse direction, and the single ground-engaging track of the first transport carriage being pivotally mounted to allow pivotal movement of the ground-engaging track relative to the chassis in a plane parallel to said transverse direction.</p>
    <p num="p-0040">The provision of first and second transport carriages allows the main chassis to be made longer to support the feeder and the discharge conveyor. This in turn means that the feeder conveyor can be made longer providing the associated advantages outlined above.</p>
    <p num="p-0041">Pivotally mounting the ground-engaging track of the first transport carriage to allow pivotal movement of the ground-engaging track relative to the chassis in a plane parallel to the transverse direction also allows the rig to negotiate ground undulations and uneven ground whilst maximizing contact between the ground and the ground-engaging tracks of the first and second transport carriages. It therefore permits optimal distribution of load to the ground-engaging tracks of the first and second transport carriages to be maintained.</p>
    <p num="p-0042">In preferred embodiments, the ground-engaging track of the first transport carriage is pivotally mounted between a pair of opposed frame elements. In such embodiments each frame element includes a pivot shaft bearing to receive a pivot shaft extending from a respective side of the ground-engaging track so as to define co-axial pivot joints on opposite sides of the ground-engaging track.</p>
    <p num="p-0043">To resist movement of the ground-engaging track towards either frame element on either side of each pivot joint, a buffer assembly is preferably provided on each side of each pivot joint on each side of the ground-engaging track of the first transport carriage.</p>
    <p num="p-0044">This arrangement helps to resist twisting movement of the ground-engaging track between the frame elements. It thereby minimizes the otherwise damaging effects to the mechanical integrity of the pivot joints in circumstances where rotational turning moments are applied to the ground-engaging track of the first transport carriage.</p>
    <p num="p-0045">Each buffer assembly may include a buffer element extending from a respective side of the ground-engaging track and a corresponding buffer element extending from a respective frame element such that buffer faces on the buffer elements abut each other.</p>
    <p num="p-0046">Cooperating buffer faces are preferably shaped to maintain abutting contact therebetween during the range of pivotal movement of the ground-engaging track of the first transport carriage relative to the carriage.</p>
    <p num="p-0047">This may be achieved, for example, by providing elongated buffer faces on the buffer elements extending from the frame elements. In such arrangements, the buffer face on each of the buffer elements extending from the ground-engaging track slides along the length of the buffer face of the corresponding buffer element extending from the respective frame element during pivotal movement of the ground-engaging track relative to the chassis. It is envisaged that such an arrangement could be reversed and that elongated buffer faces could be provided on the buffer elements extending from the ground-engaging track.</p>
    <p num="p-0048">One or more control devices is preferably provided to selectively drive the ground-engaging tracks of the respective transport carriages at different speeds and in different directions, as required, so as to control movement of rig and effect steering thereof.</p>
    <p num="p-0049">The or each control device may include a gearbox associated with each ground-engaging track. In such embodiments, the gearboxes are preferably fixedly mounted relative to the chassis and a drive shaft extending from the gearbox associated With the ground-engaging track of the first transport carriage is coupled to a drive shaft provided to drive the ground engaging track of the first transport carriage by means of a gear coupling having a floating outer sleeve.</p>
    <p num="p-0050">The gear coupling having a floating sleeve maintains driving engagement between the drive shafts, accommodating both angular and radial misalignment between the ends of the shafts during pivotal movement of the ground-engaging track relative to the chassis.</p>
    <p num="p-0051">The second transport carriage may include a single, driven, ground-engaging track or a pair of parallel, driven, ground-engaging tracks, the use of a pair of parallel, driven, ground-engaging tracks providing the associated advantages outlined above.</p>
    <p num="p-0052">In any of the aspects of the invention outlined above, the feeder conveyor may extend between the feed device and the main chassis at an angle in the range of 14-23° to level ground, and preferably in the range 15-22° to level ground. Most preferably the feeder conveyor extends at an angle of approximately 18° to level ground. An angle of inclination of approximately 18° helps to assure that the problem of hang-up or freezing, discussed herein, that is encountered when mining oil sand does not occur.</p>
    <p num="p-0053">The main chassis may optionally include supported thereon a hollow booth having at least one pedestrian entry/exit opening located approximately at the level on the main chassis of the mineral breaker.</p>
    <p num="p-0054">The provision of a booth at or adjacent the level of the mineral breaker facilitates maintenance of the rig, especially in cold climates.</p>
    <p num="p-0055">A mineral deposit end of the discharge conveyor may be located below a discharge chute of the mineral breaker to receive and convey mineral from the discharge region of the mineral breaker towards a mineral discharge end, the discharge conveyor being pivotable to permit adjustment of the angle of inclination of the discharge conveyor to level ground.</p>
    <p num="p-0056">In such an arrangement the discharge end of the feed conveyor is preferably fixedly mounted relative to the mineral breaker such that its position relative to the mineral breaker remains the same irrespective of the orientation of the main chassis relative to the ground. This ensures that dug mineral is consistently transferred from the feed conveyor to the mineral breaker.</p>
    <p num="p-0057">In other embodiments, the discharge conveyor may include a transfer section fixed generally parallel to level ground below a discharge chute of the mineral breaker to receive and convey mineral from the discharge region of the mineral breaker towards a discharge section of the discharge conveyor which is pivotable relative to the transfer section of the discharge conveyor to permit adjustment of the angle of inclination of the discharge section of the discharge conveyor to level ground.</p>
    <p num="p-0058">The provision of a transfer section fixed generally parallel to level ground below the discharge chute of the mineral breaker enables a better seal to be created between the discharge chute and the discharge conveyor. It also provides greater clearance for the deposit of mineral onto the discharge conveyor when compared with arrangements in which the discharge conveyor extends at an angle to level ground below the discharge chute. This increase in clearance below the discharge chute helps to eliminate the compaction of mineral between the discharge chute and the discharge conveyor. This in turn allows a longer mineral breaker to be used having a comparatively larger discharge chute.</p>
    <p num="p-0059">The ability to pivotally adjust the discharge section of the discharge conveyor allows the rig to accommodate variations in ground terrain while ensuring that the discharge section of the discharge conveyor is positioned as desired relative to a downstream element, such as an overland removal conveyor.</p>
    <p num="p-0060">In yet further embodiments according to any of the aspects of the invention outlined above, the discharge conveyor may include a transfer section extending from the discharge region of the mineral breaker to convey mineral from the discharge region of the mineral breaker to a transfer region where it transfers mineral to a discharge section of the discharge conveyor, the transfer section of the discharge conveyor being fixed at a predetermined angle relative to level ground and the discharge section of the discharge conveyor being pivotable relative to the transfer section of the discharge conveyor to permit adjustment of the angle of inclination of the discharge section of the discharge conveyor to level ground.</p>
    <p num="p-0061">In such embodiments, the discharge section of the discharge conveyor is preferably hingedly mounted on the main chassis to permit rotation of the discharge section relative to the main chassis. This allows the discharge section to slew relative to the main chassis and may include a slewing motor is provided to effect selective, powered rotation of the discharge section of the discharge conveyor relative to the main chassis.</p>
    <p num="p-0062">In embodiments according to any of the aspects of the invention outlined above, the feed device of the feeder may include a container including a deposit aperture through which mineral is deposited into the container, a support surface to support the mineral and a discharge aperture located in communication with the support surface and through which the mineral is discharged to a downstream processing element; and at least one transfer member moveable relative to the support surface to urge mineral through the discharge aperture towards the downstream processing element.</p>
    <p num="p-0063">The provision of a support surface within the container allows the feed device to hold a larger amount of dug mineral than, for example, a conventional hopper of the same height. As a result the feed device is able to receive a large amount of dug mineral from shovels working close by and therefore is able to act as a reservoir of dug mineral. This allows time for the shovels to dig more mineral and load it into the feeder without the supply of dug mineral to a downstream processing element becoming interrupted.</p>
    <p num="p-0064">The inclusion of at least one transfer member helps to ensure that no dug mineral is retained in the container, and thereby ensures that all dug mineral is discharged to the downstream processing element.</p>
    <p num="p-0065">In a preferred embodiment the or each transfer member includes a planar transfer plate. Such a feature is readily manufacturable and is capable of urging large quantities of dug mineral through the discharge aperture.</p>
    <p num="p-0066">In another preferred embodiment the or each transfer member includes a first support plate lying adjacent and substantially parallel to the support surface of the container, each side of the first support plate defining a leading edge, the first support plate being secured to a first edge of the transfer member such that the first support plate and the transfer plate are perpendicular to one another. The inclusion of a first support plate improves the flexural rigidity of the transfer plate, and each leading edge of the support plate is able to act to break up the dug mineral.</p>
    <p num="p-0067">Optionally the or each transfer member includes a second support plate, each side of the second support plate defining a leading edge, the second support plate being secured to a second edge of the transfer member opposite the first edge such that the second support plate and the transfer plate are perpendicular to one another.</p>
    <p num="p-0068">Such features further increase the flexural rigidity of the transfer plate, and provide additional leading edges to further assist in breaking up dug mineral.</p>
    <p num="p-0069">Preferably the or each transfer member includes at least one support web secured between the transfer plate and the or each support plate, the or each exposed edge of the or each support web defining a leading edge. The inclusion of one or more support webs increases still further the rigidity of the transfer member, and provides at least one additional leading edge to break up dug mineral.</p>
    <p num="p-0070">At least one of the leading edges may be chamfered. The provision of a chamfer on a given leading edge defines a blade to cut and even more effectively break up dug mineral.</p>
    <p num="p-0071">In another preferred embodiment the or each transfer member rotates within the container. Such an arrangement is a convenient way of ensuring that the or each transfer member is able to move over a large area of support surface and therefore urge a large amount of dug mineral through the discharge aperture.</p>
    <p num="p-0072">Preferably the container defines a bowl and the feed device further includes a rotor assembly including a rotor housing having at least one transfer member secured thereto, the rotor assembly rotating within the bowl. Such features are readily manufacturable while providing the desired urging of dug mineral through the discharge aperture.</p>
    <p num="p-0073">Optionally the rotor housing includes a toothed ring and the feed device further includes at least one motor, the or each motor being engaged with the toothed ring to rotate the rotor assembly. These features provide a desired control of the rotational speed of the rotor while ensuring sufficient torque is available to permit urging of a large volume of dug mineral through the discharge aperture.</p>
    <p num="p-0074">The rotor housing may include one or more distribution members secured to an exposed surface thereof, the or each distribution member directing dug mineral away from the exposed surface of the rotor housing and towards the support surface of the container. The provision of one or more distribution members helps to reduce the build up of dug mineral on the exposed surface of the rotor housing and thereby helps to ensure that all the dug mineral is discharged from the feed device to the downstream processing element.</p>
    <p num="p-0075">In a further preferred embodiment the or each transfer member includes a wear member located between the transfer member and a surface of the container relative to which the transfer member, in use, moves, the wear member being removable to facilitate repair or replacement. Such a feature permits the transfer member to remain in service indefinitely with only minimal downtime required to repair or replace a worn or damaged wear member.</p>
    <p num="p-0076">Optionally the container includes one or more heating elements to warm the dug mineral deposited therein. Warming the dug mineral can help the dug mineral to move more readily and thereby reduces the power required to urge the dug mineral through the discharge aperture.</p>
    <p num="p-0077">Optionally the mineral breaker includes a frame having journalled therein two or more rotatable breaker shafts each supporting at least one breaker ring including a plurality of breaker tips, the dimensions of the frame being such that on rotation of the breaker shafts each breaker tip protrudes above the frame while moving along an arc corresponding to a portion of 360° rotation of the associated breaker shaft.</p>
    <p num="p-0078">The mineral breaker may include a gearbox or a journal bearing and a frame defining an upwardly facing reject shelf overlying the gearbox or journal bearing and onto which, during use of the mineral breaker, rejected mineral passes, the reject shelf declining downwardly from a location corresponding generally to the lateral extent of the gearbox or journal bearing relative to the frame. The foregoing features assist to define a reject chute at either end of the mineral breaker that is more efficient than prior art reject chutes.</p>
    <p num="p-0079">In other embodiments according to any of the aspects of the invention outlined above, the feed device of the feeder may take the form of a hopper formed by hopper side walls mounted on a support chassis of the feeder conveyor to define a mineral deposit area.</p>
    <p num="p-0080">In yet further embodiments according to any of the aspects of the invention outlined above, the feed device of the feeder may take the form of an in-ground feeder hopper formed by walls of, for example, compacted mineral erected to surround the sides and end of a mineral deposit end of the feeder conveyor.</p>

    <p num="p-0121">The mineral breaker <b>20</b> may be of any suitable type, but is preferably a mineral breaker <b>20</b> of the type having a plurality of breaker drums such as, for example, one of the mineral breakers disclosed in European patents Nos. 0 167 178, 1 725 335 or 1 809 422.</p>
    <p num="p-0122">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the breaker drums of the mineral breaker <b>20</b> extend laterally across the width of the main chassis <b>12</b>.

    <p num="p-0123">A discharge conveyor <b>26</b> is also provided and arranged to convey mineral from a discharge region of the mineral breaker <b>20</b> to a downstream element, such as an overland removal conveyor (not shown).</p>
    <p num="p-0124">The primary transport carriage <b>14</b> includes a pair of parallel, driven, ground-engaging tracks <b>28</b> and the mobile rig <b>10</b> includes one or more control devices (not shown) for selectively driving the respective said tracks <b>28</b> at different speeds so as to effect steering of the primary transport carriage <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0125">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the ground-engaging tracks <b>28</b> are fixed in a transverse orientation relative to the main chassis <b>12</b> of the mobile rig <b>10</b>. In other embodiments, as will be described later, the main chassis <b>12</b> may be supported on the primary transport carriage <b>14</b> to permit rotation of the main chassis <b>12</b> relative to the primary transport carriage <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0126">The main chassis <b>12</b> is supported on the primary transport carriage <b>14</b> so as to be pivotable relative to the primary transport carriage <b>14</b> to raise and lower the hopper <b>16</b> relative to the ground.</p>
    <p num="p-0127">The main chassis <b>12</b> is pivotally mounted to the primary transport <b>14</b> via a pivot shaft and is moved about the pivot shaft by an associated hydraulic rain assembly.</p>
    <p num="p-0128">The feeder in the form of the hopper <b>16</b> and the feeder conveyor <b>18</b> includes a rigid frame structure <b>30</b> projecting downwardly from the main chassis <b>12</b> such that a lower end <b>32</b> of the frame structure <b>30</b> is lowered to seat on the ground (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) or raised to clear the ground (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) solely by pivoting of the main chassis <b>12</b> about the pivotal connection provided by the pivot shaft. The lower end <b>32</b> of the frame structure <b>30</b> includes a ground engaging foot <b>34</b> having a relatively wide pad <b>36</b> for seating upon the ground.</p>
    <p num="p-0129">The feeder conveyor <b>18</b> is fixedly mounted relative to the mineral breaker <b>20</b> such that its position relative to the mineral breaker <b>20</b> remains the same irrespective of the orientation of the main chassis <b>12</b> relative to the ground.</p>
    <p num="p-0130">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the feeder conveyor <b>18</b> is arranged at an angle of 22° to level ground when the lower end <b>32</b> of the feeder is seated on the ground.</p>
    <p num="p-0131">A first end <b>38</b> of the discharge conveyor <b>26</b> is located below a discharge chute <b>40</b> of the mineral breaker <b>20</b> to receive mineral discharged via the discharge region of the mineral breaker <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0132">The discharge conveyor <b>26</b> extends at an angle from the first end <b>38</b> to a second end <b>42</b>, and is pivotally connected to the main chassis <b>12</b> such that an operator is able to luff the discharge conveyor <b>26</b> to accommodate changes in ground terrain while ensuring that the second end <b>42</b> of the discharge conveyor <b>26</b> remains able to discharge onto a downstream element, such as an overland removal conveyor (not shown). Luffing cylinders may interconnect the discharge conveyor <b>26</b> and the main chassis <b>12</b> for this purpose.</p>
    <p num="p-0133">In use the main chassis <b>12</b> is pivoted relative to the primary transport carriage <b>14</b> so as to seat the lower end <b>32</b> of the feeder onto the ground. The hopper <b>16</b> of the feeder is then loaded with dug mineral, which is discharged from the hopper <b>16</b> onto the feeder conveyor <b>18</b> for conveyance to the infeed region of the mineral breaker <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0134">Following introduction into the mineral breaker <b>20</b> via the infeed region of the mineral breaker <b>20</b>, the mineral is processed to ensure that it contains no lumps over a desired size before being discharged via the discharge chute <b>40</b> in the discharge region of the mineral breaker <b>20</b> onto the first end <b>38</b> of the discharge conveyor <b>26</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0135">The mineral is then conveyed from the first end <b>38</b> of the discharge conveyor <b>26</b> to the second end <b>42</b> of the discharge conveyor <b>26</b> for discharge onto a downstream element (not shown).</p>
    <p num="p-0136">When it becomes necessary to move the mobile rig <b>10</b>, an operative first pivots the main chassis <b>12</b> relative to the primary transport carriage <b>14</b> so as to raise the lower end <b>32</b> of the feeder off the ground, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The ground-engaging tracks <b>28</b> may then be operated to move the mobile rig <b>10</b> to the next required location. Once the mobile rig <b>10</b> is positioned as desired, the operative pivots the main chassis <b>12</b> relative to the primary transport carriage <b>14</b> to lower the lower end <b>32</b> of the feeder and seat it on the ground.</p>
    <p num="p-0137">In embodiments where spot turning of the main chassis <b>12</b> is required, the main chassis <b>12</b> may be rotatably coupled to the primary transport carriage <b>14</b>, as in the mobile rig <b>44</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0138"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> show a mobile rig <b>44</b> similar to the mobile rig <b>10</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> in which the primary transport carriage <b>46</b> includes a slewing assembly (not shown) to secure the primary transport carriage <b>46</b> to the main chassis <b>48</b> such that the main chassis <b>48</b> can slew relative to the primary transport carriage <b>46</b> about a generally vertical axis.</p>
    <p num="p-0139">The slewing assembly includes a (typically toothed) slewing ring secured e.g. on the underside of the main chassis <b>48</b>, and one or more rotary slewing motors secured e.g. on the primary transport carriage <b>46</b> each having its output shaft drivingly engaged with the slewing ring e.g. by way of a pinion.</p>
    <p num="p-0140">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the main chassis <b>48</b> preferably includes a pair of longitudinally extending main chassis beams <b>50</b>, which are secured together by cross beams (not shown). Preferably each main chassis beam <b>50</b> is pivotally mounted on a plinth <b>52</b> via a respective pivot shaft <b>54</b>, and is moved about its respective pivot shaft <b>54</b> by an associated hydraulic ram assembly <b>56</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>).</p>
    <p num="p-0141">The slewing assembly defines a slewing axis S<sub>x</sub>, as illustrated diagrammatically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, about which the main chassis <b>48</b> is able to slew relative to the transport carriage <b>46</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0142">As can be seen from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the main chassis <b>48</b> includes ground engaging support legs <b>58</b> located fore and aft of the primary transport carriage <b>46</b>. A pair of support legs <b>58</b> is located on each side of the main chassis <b>48</b>, only the pair of support legs <b>58</b> on the near side being visible in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. Each support leg <b>58</b> is extendible and carries a ground engaging foot <b>60</b>, which includes a relatively wide pad <b>62</b> for seating on the ground.</p>
    <p num="p-0143">In use, the support legs <b>58</b> may be extended to seat their wide pads <b>62</b> on the ground in order to provide added support for the main chassis <b>48</b> of the mobile rig <b>44</b> whilst mineral is processed. In addition the support legs <b>58</b> may be extendible to such an extent that they are able to raise the primary transport carriage <b>46</b> clear of the ground.</p>
    <p num="p-0144">This is advantageous in situations where the transport carriage <b>46</b> has sunk into soft ground in that the support legs <b>58</b> can be used to release the transport carriage <b>46</b>. It is also advantageous in that it enables the primary transport carriage <b>46</b> to be slewed whilst raised above the ground. It therefore enables the mobile rig <b>44</b> to move in a desired direction without turning the mobile rig <b>44</b> using the primary transport carriage steerage.</p>
    <p num="p-0145">Similar ground engaging support legs may optionally be included in the mobile rig <b>10</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0146">When constructing the mobile rig <b>44</b>, the main chassis <b>48</b>, hopper <b>64</b>, feeder conveyor <b>66</b>, mineral breaker <b>68</b> and discharge conveyor <b>70</b> are arranged such that their combined centre of gravity C<sub>G </sub>lies over the primary transport carriage <b>46</b> throughout the range of pivotal displacement of the main chassis <b>48</b> relative to the primary transport carriage <b>46</b>. This is illustrated schematically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> where C<sub>g1 </sub>and C<sub>g2 </sub>illustrate the limits of the range of displacement of the combined centre of gravity C<sub>g </sub>when the main chassis <b>48</b> is tipped to its limits of pivotal displacement about pivot axis P. (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>)</p>
    <p num="p-0147">The range of angular displacement of the main chassis <b>48</b> about the pivot axis P is preferably relatively small. For example, it is preferably chosen to be less than 10° and more preferably it is about 5°. This enables the main chassis <b>48</b> to be tipped about pivot axis P and maintain stability of the main chassis <b>48</b> and the components it carries whilst the mobile rig <b>44</b> is being driven across the ground on the primary transport carriage <b>46</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0148">During use of the mobile rig <b>44</b> to process mineral, the main chassis <b>48</b> is tipped about a pivot axis P so that a lower end <b>72</b> of the feed conveyor <b>66</b> is seated upon the ground. This is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The support legs <b>58</b> may be extended to engage the ground to give additional support to the main chassis <b>48</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0149">Before moving the mobile rig <b>44</b> to a different location, the ram assemblies <b>56</b> are operated to cause the main chassis <b>48</b> to tip about the pivot axis P and so raise the lower end <b>72</b> of the feed conveyor <b>66</b> clear of the ground. This is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The transport carriage <b>46</b> can then be operated to move the mobile rig <b>44</b> across the ground to a different location.</p>
    <p num="p-0150">Preferably, the main chassis <b>48</b> is tipped to raise the lower end <b>72</b> of the feed conveyor <b>66</b> only a distance sufficient to clear the ground. However, during transport, the mobile rig <b>44</b> may encounter uneven ground or an incline. In such circumstances, the main chassis <b>48</b> may be tipped a greater amount to raise the lower end <b>72</b> of the feed conveyor <b>66</b> further from the ground. This is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0151">The maximum amount of tilting permitted is preferably such that, on level ground, the wide pads <b>62</b> of the foremost support legs <b>58</b> remain clear of the ground by a relatively short distance, which is preferably about 600 mm. This is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0152">A mobile rig <b>74</b> according to a third embodiment of the invention is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0153">The mobile rig <b>74</b> comprises a main chassis <b>76</b> and primary and auxiliary transport carriages <b>78</b>, <b>80</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12</figref>. The primary transport carriage <b>78</b> provides for powered movement of the mobile rig <b>74</b> from place to place in a mine.</p>
    <p num="p-0154">The main chassis <b>76</b> includes a feed assembly <b>82</b> to receive dug mineral at a mineral deposit end <b>98</b> and convey the dug mineral to a mineral discharge end <b>100</b>, and a mineral breaker <b>84</b> lying in communication with the mineral discharge end <b>100</b> of the feed assembly <b>82</b> to receive dug mineral discharged therefrom.</p>
    <p num="p-0155">The mineral breaker <b>84</b> may be of any suitable type, but is preferably a mineral breaker of the type having a plurality of breaker drums such as, for example, one of the mineral breakers disclosed in European patents Nos. 0 167 178, 1 725 335 or 1 809 422. In the embodiments shown, the breaker drums of the mineral breaker <b>84</b> extend laterally across the width of the main chassis <b>76</b>. In other embodiments of mobile rig the breaker drums may extend along the length of the main chassis <b>76</b>, or at another angle relative to the length of the main chassis <b>76</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0156">The main chassis <b>76</b> also includes a discharge assembly <b>86</b> to receive processed mineral from the mineral breaker <b>84</b> at a processed mineral deposit end <b>86</b> and convey the processed mineral to a processed mineral discharge end <b>88</b> from which the processed mineral is discharged to a downstream element, such as an overland conveyor (not shown).</p>
    <p num="p-0157">The primary transport carriage <b>78</b> is coupled to the main chassis <b>76</b> and includes a ground engaging transport assembly and a motive drive assembly to drive the transport assembly across the ground.</p>
    <p num="p-0158">The transport assembly includes a pair of ground-engaging tracks <b>90</b>, each of which is independently powered such that they can be driven separately so as to allow, for example, the transport assembly to spot turn.</p>
    <p num="p-0159">The primary transport carriage <b>78</b> is rotatably coupled to the main chassis <b>76</b> such that the main chassis <b>76</b> is rotatable about a generally vertical axis.</p>
    <p num="p-0160">The primary transport carriage <b>78</b> optionally includes a slewing assembly to secure the primary transport carriage <b>78</b> to the main chassis <b>76</b> such that the main chassis <b>76</b> can slew relative to the foremost transport carriage <b>78</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0161">As in the second embodiment of the invention described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the slewing assembly includes a (typically, toothed) slewing ring secured e.g. on the underside of main chassis <b>76</b>, and one or more rotary slewing motors secured e.g. on transport carriage <b>78</b> and each having its output shaft drivingly engaged with the slewing ring e.g. by way of a pinion. A control arrangement may be provided to permit controlled operation in a slewing mode (during which, if desired, the rig <b>74</b> may continue to move and may continue to process mineral).</p>
    <p num="p-0162">The auxiliary transport carriage <b>80</b> supports a feed conveyor <b>92</b> of the feed assembly <b>82</b>. As a consequence, in this embodiment, the pivotal connection between the main chassis <b>76</b> and the primary transport carriage <b>78</b> is omitted since pivotal movement of the main chassis <b>76</b> in order to raise and lower the lower end of the rigid frame of the feeder is no longer necessary since the auxiliary transport carriage <b>80</b> allows for movement of the feeder assembly <b>82</b> over the ground.</p>
    <p num="p-0163">The auxiliary transport carriage <b>80</b> may include a pair of ground-engaging tracks <b>90</b> that are controlledly powered by way of one or more control devices. By controlling the tracks <b>90</b> to move at different speeds it is possible to make the auxiliary transport carriage <b>80</b> drive one end of the rig <b>74</b> in an offset manner so as to effect slewing of the main chassis <b>76</b> relative to the primary transport carriage <b>78</b>. In such a case the aforementioned slewing assembly may not be needed.</p>
    <p num="p-0164">However, in embodiments where the slewing assembly is included, a control arrangement may be provided to permit controlled operation in a slewing mode (during which, if desired, the mobile rig <b>74</b> may continue to move, and continue to process material).</p>
    <p num="p-0165">The auxiliary transport carriage <b>80</b> may be pivotally secured to the underside of the feeder conveyor <b>92</b> so as to accommodate undulations in the ground without significantly altering the orientation of the feeder conveyor <b>92</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, this pivotal support is provided via a spherical mounting but may also be achieved through use of a mushroom coupling or an equivalent arrangement. The inclusion of such a coupling allows the auxiliary transport carriage <b>80</b> to pivot backwards and forwards and side to side relative to the feeder conveyor <b>92</b>. In this way the auxiliary transport carriage <b>80</b> is able to follow the primary transport carriage <b>78</b> and accommodate any changes in ground terrain as they may arise.</p>
    <p num="p-0166">The spherical joint coupling also permits rotation of the auxiliary transport carriage <b>80</b> relative to the feeder conveyor <b>92</b> about a generally vertical axis.</p>
    <p num="p-0167">The feeder conveyor <b>92</b> is shown extending between a hopper <b>96</b> and the main chassis <b>76</b> and is upwardly inclined relative to the ground at about 18° so as to minimize hang-up.</p>
    <p num="p-0168">The feeder conveyor <b>92</b> is located in communication with a discharge aperture <b>98</b> of the hopper <b>96</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0169">The feeder conveyor <b>92</b> is typically a so-called “plate feeder” which includes a discharge end that defines the mineral discharge end <b>100</b> of the feed assembly <b>82</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0170">In use the feeder conveyor <b>92</b> receives dug mineral discharged from the hopper <b>96</b> and conveys the dug material to the mineral discharge end <b>100</b> of the feed assembly <b>82</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0171">The discharge end <b>100</b> of the feeder conveyor <b>92</b> is fixedly mounted relative to the mineral breaker <b>84</b> such that its position relative to the mineral breaker <b>84</b> remains the same irrespective of the orientation of the main chassis <b>76</b> relative to the ground.</p>
    <p num="p-0172">The main chassis <b>76</b> supports a maintenance booth <b>102</b> adjacent to the breaker <b>84</b> and at generally the same level as it. This permits convenient maintenance operations.</p>
    <p num="p-0173">The discharge assembly <b>86</b> of the mobile rig <b>74</b> includes a discharge conveyor <b>104</b> having a first end <b>106</b> defining the processed mineral deposit end of the discharge assembly <b>86</b> and a second end <b>108</b> defining the processed mineral discharge end of the discharge assembly <b>86</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0174">In the embodiment shown, the discharge conveyor <b>104</b> is pivotally connected to the main chassis <b>76</b> such that it is pivotally adjustable through a predetermined range of angles relative to the main chassis <b>76</b> in order to provide luffing as described above. Luffing cylinders may interconnect the discharge conveyor <b>104</b> and the main chassis <b>76</b> for this purpose.</p>
    <p num="p-0175"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> show the transport carriages <b>78</b>, <b>80</b> in a first orientation relative to the remainder of the rig <b>74</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> in a second orientation, at 90° thereto, following (or during) slewing or spot turning.</p>
    <p num="p-0176">In use, shovels load dug mineral into the hopper <b>96</b> of the feed assembly <b>82</b> at one end of the mobile rig <b>74</b>. Loading of the hopper <b>96</b> can take place while the mobile rig <b>74</b> is stationary or while the mobile rig <b>74</b> is moving in the mine.</p>
    <p num="p-0177">The feeder conveyor <b>92</b> conveys the dug mineral from a mineral deposit end <b>98</b> to a discharge end <b>100</b> thereof from which it is discharged into the mineral breaker <b>84</b>. The mineral breaker <b>84</b> processes the dug mineral to ensure that is contains no lumps over a desired size, and discharges processed mineral onto a first end <b>106</b> of a discharge conveyor <b>104</b>. Any over-sized minerals not processed in this way may be automatically rejected depending on the mineral breaker <b>84</b> used.</p>
    <p num="p-0178">The discharge conveyor <b>104</b> conveys the processed mineral to the second end <b>108</b> thereof from which the processed mineral is discharged e.g. onto an overland conveyor.</p>
    <p num="p-0179">An operator is able to luff the discharge conveyor <b>104</b> to accommodate changes in ground terrain while ensuring the second end <b>108</b> of the discharge conveyor <b>104</b> remains able to discharge onto the overland conveyor.</p>
    <p num="p-0180">A significant factor in the conveying of particular minerals relates to the angle at which the dug mineral is conveyed.</p>
    <p num="p-0181">Certain dug minerals can “freeze” or “hang up” if the angles of conveyance are not correctly optimised. Hang-up of the mineral material in the mobile rig <b>74</b> is strongly undesirable because of the adverse effect on productivity. In this regard the importance of essentially continuous production in a surface mine cannot be over-emphasised.</p>
    <p num="p-0182">As explained hereinabove the feeder conveyor <b>92</b> is set at an angle of 18° relative to the ground, this being an optimised angle of conveyance that prevents material hang-up when considering a particular type of mineral.</p>
    <p num="p-0183">Other minimum conveyance angles may be suitable for different minerals although typically they will be around the value of 18°. An important design consideration is that the angle of the feeder conveyor <b>92</b> is such that the body of material conveyed may be generally as deep in an up-and-down direction as the width of the conveyor <b>92</b>, without hang-up occurring. This leads to a highly efficient conveying operation that is able to clear mineral out of the hopper <b>96</b> as fast as the shovels feed it in, thereby promoting and facilitating continuous production even when there is a requirement for a large hopper.</p>
    <p num="p-0184">A mobile rig <b>110</b> according to a fourth embodiment of the invention is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0185">The mobile rig <b>110</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is essentially the same as the mobile rig shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0186">However the discharge conveyor <b>112</b> of the mobile rig <b>110</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> differs from the discharge conveyor <b>104</b> of the mobile rig <b>74</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12</figref> in that it includes a first, transfer section (not shown) fixed generally parallel to level ground below the discharge chute (not shown) of the mineral breaker <b>118</b> to receive and convey mineral from the discharge region of the mineral breaker <b>118</b> towards a second, discharge section <b>120</b> of the discharge conveyor <b>112</b>. In other embodiments of the invention the first section may be fixed at an angle of up to 15° to level ground.</p>
    <p num="p-0187">The second section <b>120</b> is pivotally connected to the main chassis <b>122</b> to allow luffing of the second section <b>120</b> and thereby permit adjustment of the angle of the second section <b>120</b> relative to the ground.</p>
    <p num="p-0188">Fixing the first section at a predetermined angle to the ground, below the discharge chute of the mineral breaker <b>118</b>, enables a better seal to be created between the discharge chute and the discharge conveyor <b>112</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0189">It also provides greater clearance for the deposit of mineral onto the discharge conveyor <b>112</b> when compared with arrangements in which the discharge conveyor <b>112</b> extends at an angle to level ground below the discharge chute, such as those shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-12</figref>. This increase in clearance below the discharge chute helps to eliminate the compaction of mineral between the discharge chute and the discharge conveyor <b>112</b>. This in turn allows a longer mineral breaker to be used having a comparatively large discharge chute.</p>

    <p num="p-0222">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the breaker drums of the mineral breaker <b>202</b> extend laterally across the width of the main chassis <b>190</b>.

    <p num="p-0224">The first and second transport carriages <b>192</b>, <b>194</b> each includes a single, driven, ground-engaging track <b>208</b> and are arranged such that the ground-engaging tracks <b>208</b> are located in a spaced, parallel configuration and oriented relative to the main chassis <b>190</b> in a fixed transverse direction. This arrangement permits the use of a longer main chassis <b>190</b> to support the hopper <b>198</b> and the feeder conveyor <b>200</b>.</p>

    <p num="p-0227">The ground-engaging track <b>208</b> of the first transport carriage <b>192</b> is pivotally mounted on the main chassis <b>190</b> to allow pivotal movement of the ground-engaging track <b>208</b> relative to the main chassis <b>190</b> in a plane generally parallel to the-transverse direction.</p>
    <p num="p-0228">The ground-engaging track <b>208</b> of the second transport carriage <b>194</b> is, in contrast, fixedly mounted on the main chassis <b>190</b>. In other embodiments of the invention the ground-engaging track <b>208</b> of the second transport carriage <b>194</b> may be pivotally mounted on the main chassis <b>190</b> to allow pivotal movement of the ground-engaging track <b>208</b> relative to the main chassis <b>190</b> in a plane generally parallel to the transverse direction.</p>
    <p num="p-0229">In order to pivotally mount the ground-engaging track <b>208</b> of the first transport carriage <b>192</b>, for example, on the main chassis <b>190</b>, the ground-engaging track <b>208</b> is mounted between a pair of opposed frame elements <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, which extend from the underside of the main chassis <b>190</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0230">Each frame element <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> includes a pivot shaft bearing <b>214</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>) to receive a pivot shaft <b>213</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>) extending from a respective side of the ground-engaging track <b>208</b> so as to define co-axial pivot joints <b>215</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>) on opposite sides of the ground-engaging track <b>208</b>. Such pivotal connections allow the ground-engaging track <b>208</b> to pivot about a pivot axis A defined by the pivot joints <b>215</b> in response to undulations in the ground over which the mobile rig <b>188</b> is moved. This in turn allows contact between the ground and the ground-engaging tracks <b>208</b> to be maximized in circumstances where the slope of the ground under each of the ground-engaging tracks <b>208</b> differs. It therefore permits distribution of load to the ground-engaging tracks <b>208</b> and reduces the risk of any twisting forces being transmitted to the main chassis <b>190</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0231">The provision of pivotal joints <b>215</b> to pivotally mount the ground-engaging track <b>208</b> of the first transport carriage <b>192</b> between the opposed frame elements <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> renders the ground-engaging track <b>208</b> vulnerable to rotational turning moments. This is particularly so in circumstances where the first transport carriage <b>192</b> sinks into soft ground. During steering of the mobile rig <b>188</b> in such conditions relatively large rotational turning moments are applied to the ground-engaging track <b>208</b> of the first transport carriage <b>192</b>. So as to avoid such rotational turning moments being transmitted to the pivot joints <b>215</b> and thereby damaging the pivot joints, a buffer assembly <b>214</b> is provided on each side of each pivot joint <b>215</b> to resist movement of the ground-engaging track <b>208</b> towards either frame element <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> on either side of each pivot joint <b>215</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0232">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, each buffer assembly <b>214</b> includes a buffer element <b>216</b> extending from a respective side of the ground-engaging track <b>208</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. Each buffer assembly <b>214</b> also includes a corresponding buffer element <b>218</b> extending from the respective frame element <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. The corresponding buffer elements <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> extending from the ground-engaging track <b>208</b> and the frame elements <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> are aligned such that buffer faces <b>220</b> on the corresponding buffer elements <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> abut each other. This abutment resists movement of the ground-engaging track <b>208</b> towards the respective frame element <b>210</b>,<b>212</b> in the event a rotational turning moment is applied to the ground-engaging track <b>208</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0233">Spacing of the buffer assemblies <b>214</b> on each side of the respective pivot joints allows any rotational turning moments applied to the ground-engaging track <b>208</b> to be distributed along the length of the ground-engaging track <b>208</b> and frame elements <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>, allowing the ground-engaging track <b>208</b> and frame elements <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> to absorb the rotational turning moments and minimize the risk of damage to the pivotal joints.</p>
    <p num="p-0234">If the buffer assemblies <b>214</b> were omitted, counterbalancing of any rotational turning moments would be provided solely by the pivotal joints rendering the pivotal joints susceptible to damage, which would threaten their mechanical integrity.</p>
    <p num="p-0235">In the event that manufacturing tolerances lead to gaps between the buffer faces <b>220</b> of corresponding buffer elements shims (not shown) may be located between the buffer faces <b>220</b>. This ensures that contact between the buffer elements <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> minimizes the risk of any twisting movement of the ground-engaging track <b>208</b> between the frame elements <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0236">To ensure that abutting contact is also maintained through the range of pivotal movement of the ground-engaging track <b>208</b> relative to the main chassis <b>190</b>, the buffer faces <b>220</b> of the buffer elements <b>218</b> extending from the frame elements <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> are elongated. This allows the buffer faces <b>220</b> of the corresponding buffer elements <b>216</b> extending from the ground-engaging track <b>208</b> to slide along the elongated buffer faces <b>220</b> during pivotal movement of the ground-engaging track <b>208</b> relative to the main chassis <b>190</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0237">It is envisaged that in other embodiments the buffer faces <b>220</b> on the buffer elements <b>216</b> extending from the ground-engaging track <b>208</b> may be elongated in addition or as an alternative to the arrangement described above.</p>
    <p num="p-0238">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, a gearbox <b>222</b> is mounted on one of the frame elements <b>212</b> of the first transport carriage <b>192</b> to control drive to the ground-engaging track <b>208</b>. Drive is transferred from the gearbox <b>222</b> to the ground-engaging track <b>208</b> by means of a drive shaft <b>224</b> extending from the gearbox <b>222</b> and a drive shaft <b>226</b> coupled to the ground-engaging track <b>208</b>. To allow for pivotal movement of the ground-engaging track <b>208</b> relative to the frame element <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>, and therefore relative displacement of the drive shafts <b>224</b>, <b>226</b>, a gear coupling <b>228</b> having a floating sleeve <b>230</b> is used to couple the drive shafts <b>224</b>, <b>226</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. The floating sleeve <b>230</b> acts as an intermediary member to transmit drive from one drive shaft to the other drive shaft and therefore allows coupling of the drive shafts <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> to be maintained (within certain limits) during both angular and radial misalignment between ends of the drive shafts <b>224</b>, <b>226</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0239">The gear coupling <b>228</b> is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</figref> and includes first and second hubs <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>).</p>
    <p num="p-0240">The hubs <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> are formed to define internal splines <b>236</b>, each of which engages external gear teeth (not shown) provided on the end of a respective one of the drive shafts <b>224</b>, <b>226</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0241">The hubs <b>232</b>,<b>234</b> are received within the floating sleeve <b>230</b>, which is formed to define internal gear teeth <b>240</b>, which engage external gear teeth <b>242</b> on the hubs <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0242">The hubs <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> are retained within the floating sleeve <b>230</b> by means of end clamps <b>244</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>), each of which is formed in two halves to allow location thereof about the hubs <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> and the floating sleeve <b>230</b> before being secured together by means of bolts <b>246</b>. An inner flange <b>248</b> provided within each end clamp <b>244</b> is received within a recess <b>250</b> formed in the outer surface towards a respective end of the floating sleeve <b>230</b> to prevent separation of the components. The end clamps <b>244</b> therefore prevent axial movement of the floating sleeve <b>230</b> relative to the hubs <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> and therefore relative to the drive shafts <b>224</b>, <b>226</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0243">Engagement between the external gear teeth on the gearbox drive shaft <b>224</b> and the internal spline <b>236</b> of the respective hub <b>234</b> causes rotation of the hub <b>234</b> which in turn causes rotation of the floating sleeve <b>230</b> by virtue of engagement between the external gear teeth <b>242</b> on the hub <b>234</b> and the internal gear teeth <b>240</b> in the floating sleeve <b>230</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0244">Engagement between the internal gear teeth <b>240</b> in the floating sleeve <b>230</b> and the external gear teeth <b>242</b> of the hub <b>232</b> provided on the end of the ground-engaging track drive shaft <b>226</b> causes rotation of the hub <b>232</b>, which in turn causes rotation of the ground-engaging track drive shaft <b>226</b> through engagement between the internal spline <b>236</b> of the hub <b>232</b> and the external gear teeth on the ground-engaging drive shaft <b>226</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0245">The external gear teeth <b>242</b> of the hubs <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> are crowned so as to define a rounded tooth profile. This configuration ensure that the floating sleeve <b>230</b> is not rigidly connected to either of the hubs <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> and therefore allows driving engagement between the external gear teeth <b>242</b> of the hubs <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> and the internal gear teeth <b>240</b> in the floating sleeve <b>230</b> to be maintained when the two hubs <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> are out of radial and/or angular alignment. This is because it allows the floating sleeve <b>230</b> to move relative to the hubs <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> and thereby adjust to so as to maintain torsional connection of the hubs <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> even when the ends of the drive shafts <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> are misaligned.</p>
    <p num="p-0246">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> the feeder conveyor <b>200</b> is fixed at an angle of approximately 18° relative to level ground, this being an optimized angle of conveyance that prevents material hang-up when considering one particular type of material.</p>
    <p num="p-0247">As explained earlier with reference to the other embodiments, other minimum conveyance angles may be suitable for different materials although typically they will be around the value of 18° and in the range of 15-22° to level ground.</p>

    <p num="p-0249">The discharge conveyor <b>209</b> extends at an angle from the first end <b>246</b> to a second end <b>250</b>, and is pivotally connected to the main chassis <b>190</b> such that an operator is able to lull the discharge conveyor <b>209</b> to accommodate changes in ground terrain while ensuring that the second end <b>250</b> of the discharge conveyor <b>209</b> remains able to discharge onto a downstream element, such as an overland removal conveyor (not shown). Luffing cylinders may interconnect the discharge conveyor <b>209</b> and the main chassis <b>190</b> for this purpose.</p>
    <p num="p-0250">In use the hopper <b>198</b> of the feed device is loaded with dug mineral, which is discharged from the hopper onto the feeder conveyor <b>200</b> for conveyance to the infeed region of the mineral breaker <b>202</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0251">Following introduction into the mineral breaker <b>202</b> via the infeed region of the mineral breaker <b>202</b>, the mineral is processed to ensure that it contains no lumps over a desired size before being discharged via the discharge chute <b>248</b> in the discharge region of the mineral breaker <b>202</b> onto the first end <b>246</b> of the discharge conveyor <b>209</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0252">The mineral is then conveyed from the first end <b>246</b> of the discharge conveyor <b>209</b> to the second end <b>250</b> of the discharge conveyor <b>209</b> for discharge onto a downstream element (not shown).</p>
    <p num="p-0253">Use of the mineral breaker disclosed in European patent application No. 1 725 335 allows oversized material which cannot be broken by the mineral breaker <b>202</b> and cannot therefore be discharge via the discharge chute <b>248</b> to be removed from the mineral processing route defined by the mobile rig <b>188</b>. The oversized material is preferably removed by means of a chute (not shown), extending from an opposite side of the mineral breaker <b>202</b> to the infeed region, to a receptacle.</p>
    <p num="p-0254">In another embodiment not shown in the drawings, the discharge conveyor <b>209</b> may be constructed to include a first, transfer section fixed generally parallel to level ground below the discharge chute <b>248</b> of the mineral breaker <b>202</b> to receive and convey mineral from the discharge region of the mineral breaker <b>202</b> towards a second, discharge section of the discharge conveyor <b>209</b>, as described earlier with reference to the mobile rig <b>110</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. In other embodiments of the invention the first section may be fixed at an angle of up to 15° to level ground.</p>
    <p num="p-0255">In a yet further embodiment not shown in the drawings, the discharge conveyor <b>209</b> may be constructed to include transfer and discharge sections as described earlier with reference to the mobile rigs <b>124</b>, <b>176</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14</figref>, <b>15</b> and <b>17</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0256">A mobile rig <b>256</b> according to a tenth embodiment of the invention is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>, and includes a main chassis <b>258</b> mounted on first, second and third transport carriages <b>260</b>, <b>262</b>, <b>264</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0257">The mobile rig <b>256</b> also includes a feed device in the form of an in-ground feeder hopper <b>266</b> and a feeder conveyor <b>268</b> arranged to convey mineral deposited in the in-ground feeder hopper <b>266</b> to an infeed region of a mineral breaker <b>270</b> mounted on the main chassis <b>258</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0258">The feeder conveyor <b>268</b> is preferably of a plate type having a continuous chain of flights.</p>
    <p num="p-0259">In contrast to the previously described embodiments, the in-ground feeder hopper <b>266</b> is preferably defined by walls of e.g. compacted mineral erected to surround the sides and end of a mineral deposit end <b>272</b> of the feeder conveyor <b>268</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0260">Such a hopper arrangement is advantageous in circumstances where the mobile rig <b>256</b> can be located below the mining operation since it may be arranged such that mineral can be swept from the mining floor, above the in-ground hopper <b>266</b>, directly into the in-ground hopper <b>266</b>. This arrangement can be used to improve efficiency and rate at which mineral can be loaded into the hopper since it removes the need to lift the mineral for deposit into the hopper. It also means that less accuracy is required to deliver the mineral since the sloped side walls of compacted mineral direct the mineral towards the mineral deposit end <b>272</b> of the feeder conveyor <b>268</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0261">The provision of sloped side walls of compacted mineral, and sweeping the mineral down these side walls, also serves to reduce the impact of the mineral onto the mineral deposit end of the feeder conveyor thereby reducing the amount of wear to the feeder conveyor <b>268</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0262">It is envisaged that in other embodiments the in-ground feeder hopper <b>266</b> may be replaced by a hopper defined by hopper side walls mounted on a support chassis of the feeder conveyor <b>268</b>, such as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> for example.</p>
    <p num="p-0263">The mineral breaker <b>270</b> of the mobile rig <b>256</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref> may be of any suitable type, but is preferably a mineral breaker of the type having a plurality of breaker drums such as, for example, one of the mineral breakers disclosed in European patents Nos. 0 167 178, 1 725 335 or 1 809 422.</p>
    <p num="p-0264">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>, the breaker drums of the mineral breaker <b>270</b> extend laterally across the width of the main chassis <b>258</b>. In other embodiments the breaker drums may extend along the length of the main chassis <b>258</b>, or at another angle relative to the length of the main chassis <b>258</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0265">A discharge conveyor <b>274</b> is also provided and arranged to convey mineral from a discharge region of the mineral breaker <b>270</b> to a downstream element, such as an overland removal conveyor (not shown).</p>
    <p num="p-0266">The first, second and third transport carriages <b>260</b>, <b>262</b>, <b>264</b> each includes a pair of parallel, driven, ground-engaging tracks <b>276</b>, <b>278</b> located in a spaced configuration such that the first and third transport carriages <b>260</b>, <b>264</b> are spaced in a lengthwise direction of the main chassis <b>258</b> from the second transport carriage <b>262</b> and the first and third transport carriages <b>260</b>, <b>264</b> are spaced in a widthwise direction of the main chassis <b>258</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0267">In this arrangement the location of the second transport carriage <b>262</b> from the first and third transport carriages <b>260</b>, <b>264</b> permits the use of a longer chassis <b>258</b> to support the feeder conveyor <b>268</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0268">The location of the first and third transport carriages <b>260</b>, <b>264</b> provides additional support to the main chassis <b>258</b> below the mineral breaker <b>270</b> where the main chassis <b>258</b> is generally wider. It therefore improves the stability of the main chassis <b>258</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0269">Each of the first, second and third transport carriages <b>260</b>, <b>262</b>, <b>264</b> is rotatably coupled to the main chassis <b>258</b> to allow steering of the mobile rig <b>256</b> during movement.</p>
    <p num="p-0270">Each of the transport carriages <b>260</b>, <b>262</b>, <b>264</b> optionally includes a slewing assembly to secure the transport carriage <b>260</b>, <b>262</b>, <b>264</b> to the main chassis <b>258</b> such that the main chassis <b>258</b> can slew relative to each transport carriage <b>260</b>, <b>262</b>, <b>264</b> through a full 360°. This allows, for example, the orientation of the tracks <b>276</b>, <b>278</b> of the transport carriages <b>260</b>, <b>262</b>, <b>264</b> to be adjusted from a lengthwise direction (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>) to a transverse direction (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 and 29</figref>) in the event it is necessary to move the mobile rig <b>256</b> in a transverse direction, for example.</p>
    <p num="p-0271">Each slewing assembly may include a (typically, toothed) slewing ring secured e.g. on the underside of the main chassis <b>258</b> and one or more rotary slewing motors secured e.g. on a respective transport carriage <b>260</b>, <b>262</b>, <b>264</b> and each having its output shaft drivingly engaged with a respective slewing ring e.g. by way of a pinion. A control arrangement may be provided to permit controlled operation in a slewing mode.</p>
    <p num="p-0272">As a result of the rotatable mounting of the main chassis <b>258</b> on the second transport carriage <b>262</b>, the in-ground feeder hopper <b>266</b> includes angled wall members located above the intended path of the second transport carriage <b>262</b> below the main chassis <b>258</b>. This arrangement ensures that dug mineral does not impede rotation of the second transport carriage <b>262</b> relative to the main chassis <b>258</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0273">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref> the feeder conveyor <b>268</b> is fixed at an angle of approximately 18° relative to level ground, this being an optimized angle of conveyance that prevents material hang-up when considering one particular type of material.</p>
    <p num="p-0274">As explained earlier with reference to the other embodiments, other minimum conveyance angles may be suitable for different materials although typically they will be around the value of 18° and in the range of 15-22° to level ground.</p>
    <p num="p-0275">A first end <b>280</b> of the discharge conveyor <b>274</b> is located below a discharge chute <b>282</b> of the mineral breaker <b>270</b> to receive mineral discharged via the discharge region of the mineral breaker <b>270</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0276">The discharge conveyor <b>274</b> extends at an angle from the first end <b>280</b> to a second end <b>284</b>, and is pivotally connected to the main chassis <b>258</b> such that an operator is able to luff the discharge conveyor <b>274</b> to accommodate changes in ground terrain while ensuring that the second end <b>284</b> of the discharge conveyor <b>274</b> remains able to discharge onto a downstream element, such as an overland removal conveyor (not shown). Luffing cylinders may interconnect the discharge conveyor <b>274</b> and the main chassis <b>258</b> for this purpose.</p>
    <p num="p-0277">In use dug mineral is delivered into the in-ground feeder hopper <b>266</b> and onto the mineral deposit end <b>272</b> of the feeder conveyor <b>268</b> for conveyance to the infeed region of the mineral breaker <b>270</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0278">Following introduction into the mineral breaker <b>270</b> via the infeed region of the mineral breaker <b>270</b>, the mineral is processed to ensure that it contains no lumps over a desired size before being discharged via the discharge chute <b>282</b> in the discharge region of the mineral breaker <b>270</b> onto the first end <b>280</b> of the discharge conveyor <b>274</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0279">The mineral is then conveyed from the first end <b>280</b> of the discharge conveyor <b>274</b> to the second end <b>284</b> of the discharge conveyor <b>274</b> for discharge onto a downstream element (not shown).</p>
    <p num="p-0280">Use of the mineral breaker disclosed in European patent application No. 1 725 335 allows oversized material which cannot be broken by the mineral breaker <b>270</b> and cannot therefore be discharged via the discharge chute <b>282</b> to be removed from the mineral processing route defined by the mobile rig <b>256</b>.

    <p num="p-0281">In another embodiment not shown in the drawings, the discharge conveyor <b>274</b> may be constructed to include a first, transfer section fixed generally parallel to level ground below the discharge chute <b>282</b> of the mineral breaker <b>270</b> to receive and convey mineral from the discharge region of the mineral breaker <b>270</b> towards a second, discharge section of the discharge conveyor <b>274</b>, as described earlier with reference to the mobile rig <b>110</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.

    <p num="p-0283">It is envisaged that the hopper employed in each of the mobile rigs described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> and <b>8</b>-<b>19</b> may be replaced with an in-ground feeder hopper, such as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>. In this regard a mobile rig <b>285</b> according to an eleventh embodiment of the invention is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> which is essentially identical to the mobile rig shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> except that the hopper has been replaced by an in-ground feeder hopper <b>267</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0284">It is also envisaged that each of the mobile rigs shown and described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, <b>8</b>-<b>19</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>30</b> may be modified to include a feed device such as the feed device <b>286</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31(</figref> <i>a</i>), <b>31</b>(<i>b</i>), and <b>32</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0285">The feed device <b>286</b> comprises a container <b>288</b> and three transfer members <b>290</b>. Other embodiments of the invention may include a greater number or a fewer number of transfer members <b>290</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0286">The container <b>288</b> includes a deposit aperture <b>292</b> through which dug mineral (not shown) is deposited into the container <b>288</b>. In the embodiment shown the deposit aperture <b>292</b> is defined by an open top of the container <b>288</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0287">The container <b>288</b> also includes a support surface <b>294</b> to support the deposited dug mineral, and a discharge aperture <b>296</b> located in communication with the support surface <b>294</b>, and through which dug mineral is discharged to a downstream processing element (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>).</p>
    <p num="p-0288">The transfer members <b>290</b> are moveable relative to the support surface <b>294</b> to urge the dug mineral through the discharge aperture <b>296</b> towards the downstream processing element.</p>
    <p num="p-0289">Each transfer member <b>290</b> includes a planar transfer plate <b>298</b> and a first support plate <b>300</b> which lies adjacent and substantially parallel to the support surface <b>294</b> of the container <b>288</b>. Each side <b>302</b> of each first support plate <b>300</b> defines a leading edge <b>304</b>, which is active according to the direction in which the transfer member <b>290</b> is moving. Each first support plate <b>300</b> is secured to a first edge <b>306</b> of the transfer member <b>290</b> such that the first support plate <b>300</b> and the transfer plate <b>298</b> are perpendicular to one another.</p>
    <p num="p-0290">Each transfer member <b>290</b> also includes a second support plate <b>307</b>, each side <b>308</b> of which defines a leading edge <b>304</b>. Each second support plate <b>306</b> is secured to a second edge <b>310</b> of the transfer member <b>290</b>, opposite the first edge <b>306</b>, such that the second support plate <b>306</b> and the transfer plate <b>298</b> are perpendicular to one another.</p>
    <p num="p-0291">The transfer members <b>290</b> also include four support webs <b>312</b> which, in the embodiment shown, are secured between the transfer plate <b>298</b> and each of the first and second support plates <b>300</b>, <b>307</b>. Other embodiments of the invention may include a different number and arrangement of support webs <b>312</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0292">Each support web <b>312</b> includes an exposed edge <b>314</b> which defines a leading edge <b>304</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0293">In the embodiment shown, each of the leading edges <b>304</b> is chamfered so as to define a blade to cut and break up dug mineral.</p>
    <p num="p-0294">Other embodiments of feed device <b>286</b> may include transfer members <b>290</b> having differing combinations and arrangements of transfer plate <b>298</b>, first support plate <b>300</b>, second support plate <b>306</b> and support web <b>312</b> depending on the nature of dug mineral being mined.</p>
    <p num="p-0295">The three transfer members <b>290</b> rotate within the container <b>288</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0296">The container <b>288</b> shown in the figures defines a bowl <b>316</b> which is substantially circular when viewed in plan, and which has a side wall <b>318</b> that extends substantially perpendicular to the support surface <b>294</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0297">The feed device <b>286</b> also includes a rotor assembly <b>320</b> that includes a rotor housing <b>322</b> to which the three transfer members <b>290</b> are secured. The three transfer members <b>290</b> are equally spaced around the periphery of the rotor housing <b>322</b>. Other embodiments of the invention may include a differing number and/or differently spaced transfer members <b>290</b> secured to the rotor housing <b>322</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0298">The rotor assembly <b>320</b> is located within the bowl <b>316</b> and also rotates therein.</p>
    <p num="p-0299">The rotor housing <b>322</b> includes a toothed ring <b>324</b> and the feed device <b>286</b> further includes six motors <b>326</b> (only two shown), each motor <b>326</b> being engaged with the toothed ring <b>324</b> to rotate the rotor assembly <b>320</b>. Other numbers of motor <b>326</b> are also possible.</p>
    <p num="p-0300">The rotor housing <b>322</b> also includes three distribution members <b>328</b> secured to an exposed surface <b>330</b> thereof. Preferably each distribution member <b>328</b> is in the form of a triangular plate <b>332</b> which is radially aligned with a corresponding transfer member <b>290</b>. In use the distribution members <b>328</b> direct dug mineral away from the exposed surface <b>330</b> of the rotor housing <b>322</b> towards the support surface <b>294</b> of the container <b>288</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0301">Each transfer member <b>290</b> includes a wear member <b>334</b> that is located between the transfer member <b>290</b> and the side wall <b>318</b> of the container <b>288</b> relative to which an end of the transfer member <b>290</b> moves during use.</p>
    <p num="p-0302">The container <b>288</b> may include one or more heaters (not shown) to warm the dug mineral deposited therein.</p>
    <p num="p-0303">In use the container <b>288</b> of the feed device <b>286</b> defines a large target for shovels to load dug mineral into. In addition, the inclusion of a support surface <b>294</b> allows the container <b>288</b> to act as a reservoir of dug mineral which accommodates interruptions in the loading of dug mineral into the feed device <b>286</b> while maintaining a continuous supply of dug mineral to a downstream processing element.</p>
    <p num="p-0304">The rotor assembly <b>320</b> rotates, typically at ½ a rpm, within the bowl <b>316</b> of the container <b>288</b> to move the transfer members <b>290</b> in an arc over the support surface <b>294</b>. This movement distributes the dug mineral within the container <b>288</b> and urges it through the discharge aperture <b>296</b>. During such movement the first and second support plates <b>300</b>, <b>307</b> and the support webs <b>312</b> act to break up the dug mineral which assists in urging it through the discharge aperture <b>296</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0305">It is possible to alter the rotational speed of the rotor assembly <b>320</b> to, for example, vary the bed depth on a downstream conveyor onto which the dug mineral is discharged through the discharge aperture <b>296</b>. In this way it is possible to vary the throughput of dug mineral to downstream equipment.</p>
    <p num="p-0306">It is also possible to vary the rotational speed of the rotor assembly <b>320</b> to accommodate changes to the speed of, for example, the downstream conveyor. In this way it is possible to maintain a given bed depth on the downstream conveyor regardless of changes to the speed of the downstream conveyor.</p>
    <p num="p-0307">In addition, since the dug mineral is evenly distributed within the container <b>288</b> the power requirement of such a downstream conveyor is reduced because it only has to pull a given bed depth of dug mineral, rather than a large and heavy concentration of dug mineral.</p>
    <p num="p-0308">The use of a cylindrical bowl in the feed device <b>286</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31(</figref> <i>a</i>), <b>31</b>(<i>b</i>), and <b>32</b> is advantageous in that it opens up the possibility of using a single transport carriage.</p>
    <p num="p-0309">Such an arrangement is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 34</figref>, which show a mobile rig <b>336</b> that includes a cylindrical bowl-type feeder <b>338</b>, of the same or similar type to those described hereinabove with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31(</figref> <i>a</i>), <b>31</b>(<i>b</i>) and <b>32</b>, whose discharge aperture feeds mineral material onto a feed conveyor <b>340</b> that is also the same as or similar to the arrangement previously described. The main difference however between the mobile rig <b>336</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 34</figref> on the one hand and, for example, the mobile rig shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref> on the other is that the rig <b>336</b> is supported on a single transport carriage <b>342</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0310">The transport carriage <b>342</b> underlies the feed conveyor <b>340</b> at a location chosen such that the mass of a mineral breaker <b>344</b> located at the end of the feed conveyor <b>340</b> that lies remote from the feeder <b>338</b> is balanced by the mass of the feeder <b>338</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0311">The possibility of this arrangement derives principally from the fact that the employment of a cylindrical bowl means that the feeder <b>338</b> may be made virtually to any size and hence may be large enough to balance the mass of the breaker <b>344</b>. Since in many applications the rig <b>336</b> will be in continuous use the mass of mineral permanently in the feeder <b>338</b> may also contribute to the balancing effect.</p>
    <p num="p-0312">The mass of mineral deposited as each shovel load in the feeder <b>338</b> typically may be approximately 100 tonnes and it may be necessary to react the impulses of such loads during use of the rig <b>336</b>. This may be achieved for example through the inclusion of a hydraulic damper (or any of a range of equivalent means) acting to stabilize the rig <b>336</b> relative to the ground.</p>
    <p num="p-0313">The feed conveyor <b>340</b> is shown secured on the upper side of the transport carriage <b>342</b> by way of a pivot that is hydraulically operable in order to provide for adjustment of the angle of inclination of the conveyor <b>340</b>. The pivot however may be omitted and a slewing ring and motor arrangement provided instead, the slewing ring and motor arrangement being operable to permit controlled slewing of the major part of the rig <b>336</b> relative to the transport carriage <b>342</b>. In a further embodiment, both a pivot, and a slewing ring and motor arrangement may be provided, so as to permit angular adjustment of the conveyor <b>340</b> and slewing of the major part of the rig <b>336</b> relative to the transport carriage <b>342</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0314">The discharge of the mineral breaker <b>344</b> feeds to a transfer conveyor <b>346</b> by means of a motorized pivot arrangement. This permits selective rotation of the transfer conveyor <b>346</b> as shown schematically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> to feed a processed mineral material to e.g. a number of waiting trucks. The angle of the transfer conveyor <b>346</b> relative to the ground is also adjustable through use of the hydraulic ram assembly that is visible in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0315">The apparatus of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 34</figref> is, like the other embodiments of the invention, capable of efficient operation to process minerals even while being moved from place to place about a mine.</p>
    <p num="p-0316">As is apparent from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 34</figref> hereof the feeder <b>338</b> is similarly inclined to the ground, whereby the axis of rotation of the rotor assembly is at right angles to the bed of the feed conveyor <b>340</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0317">This produces particular advantages in terms of avoiding freezing or hang-up of dug mineral material in the feeder <b>338</b> itself. This is because in effect the rearmost portion of the circular wall of the feeder (i.e. the portion of the feeder that is spaced furthest from the discharge aperture), where the effective angle of inclination encountered by mineral material falling from the shovels is at its shallowest, is inclined at 75° to the ground (assuming the feed conveyor angle is) 15° and the parts of wall, adjacent the discharge aperture, will also be inclined such that hang-up is prevented. At all further points of the wall between the aforesaid portions the angle of inclination of wall is adequate to prevent the freezing or hang-up problems mentioned, being at least as steep as the “rearmost” part.</p>
    <p num="p-0318">Nevertheless, in other embodiments of the invention the cylindrical bowl of the feeder <b>338</b> may be inclined at an angle to the bed of the feed conveyor <b>340</b>, and so the axis of rotation of the corresponding rotor assembly may extend at an angle other than 90° to the bed of the feed conveyor <b>340</b> </p>
    <p num="p-0319">In addition to the foregoing the use of an essentially cylindrical bowl for the feeder <b>338</b> eliminates the valleys that arise at the joints between the flat plates of pyramidal hoppers of the prior art. The angles of such valleys relative to the ground in prior art hoppers can be small enough to give rise to the hang-up problem.</p>
    <p num="p-0320">A further advantage of using a circular bowl lies in the ability to employ the rotor assembly to drive material onto the feed conveyor <b>340</b>. This provides for continuous clearing out of the container such that the shovels may continuously replenish it without the height to which dug mineral material is piled becoming inconvenient.</p>
    <p num="p-0321">Use of a cylindrical bowl additionally confers great versatility on a rig <b>336</b> made in accordance with the invention. This is not least because the designer may vary at will the diameter, and hence the volume, of the bowl in order e.g. to accommodate differing shovel sizes, without any requirement in design terms for the feeder size to be related to the size of the feed conveyor.</p>
    <p num="p-0322">Thus in a further broad aspect, that is applicable to all embodiments, the invention may be considered to reside in a container or hopper, for a mobile mineral processing rig, the container including one or more side walls the inclination of which, relative to the ground, in use exceeds a predetermined minimum value that is sufficient to prevent or substantially eliminate mineral hang-up in the container.</p>
    <p num="p-0323">More specifically the invention resides in an essentially cylindrical container, for a mobile mineral rig, the container defining a centre axis that is in use inclined relative to the ground at such an angle that all parts of a side wall forming part of the container are inclined at least at an angle that prevents or eliminates hang-up of the mineral being processed.</p>
    <p num="p-0324">In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, as stated, the cylindrical container may contain a rotor assembly whose axis of rotation coincides with the aforesaid centre axis. As noted, such an arrangement gives rise to various advantages that are not available in the prior art.</p>
    <p num="p-0325">In other embodiments of the invention, the mineral breaker provided in each of the mobile rigs shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, <b>8</b>-<b>19</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>30</b> may be replaced by the mineral breaker <b>350</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35 and 36</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0326">The breaker <b>350</b> includes at its uppermost (mineral infeed) end a frame <b>352</b> in which are rotatably journalled the shafts of respective, mutually meshed breaker drums. The latter are of per se known design and each includes a series of breaker rings <b>354</b> supporting a further series of breaker teeth <b>356</b>. The frame <b>352</b> defines as its uppermost surface a shelf <b>358</b> that in use is horizontal. The shelf <b>358</b> declines steeply downwards as shown at <b>359</b> a short distance from the breaker drums, the horizontal length of shelf being effectively the minimum needed to accommodate a journal bearing or gearbox (or other component, depending on the design of breaker) accommodated within frame <b>352</b> beneath it.</p>
    <p num="p-0327">The heights of the walls of frame <b>352</b> are such that the tips of the teeth <b>356</b> are exposed for at least part of the rotation of the breaker drums.</p>
    <p num="p-0328">In such embodiments, the main chassis preferably supports a maintenance booth adjacent the breaker and at generally the same level as it. This permits convenient maintenance operations.</p>
    <p num="p-0329">The discharge conveyor in any of the embodiments shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, <b>8</b>-<b>19</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>30</b> may be fanned so as to include an end portion adjacent to the second end thereof which is moveable between a first, erect configuration in which the end portion lies in line with the remainder of the discharge conveyor, as shown by dashed lines in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, and a second, drooped configuration in which the end portion adopts a lower, curved profile, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>.</p>
