    <heading>MICROFICHE/COPYRIGHT REFERENCE</heading> <p num="p-0004">[Not Applicable]</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0005">This invention relates to amusement or gaming device methods and systems. Electronic gaming machines are generally known, and may take the form of slot machines, poker machines, blackjack machines, roulette machines, etc. The electronic machine takes the place of the dealer for games of the type that involve a dealer, and the player, after inputting money or tokens representing the wager or drawing an amount to be wagered from a credit balance associated with the player in the machine, inputs card selection and/or other gaming decision inputs by pushing buttons provided on the machine or in some instances by placing a finger on a box displayed on a CRT or LCD touch screen.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">Electronic amusement machines are also known, and are often provided in restaurants or lounges in non-gaming jurisdictions or environments for patron amusement. Patrons typically insert coins into the machines for the privilege of playing on the machines, and scoring of the game is done by the machine. Typically, player input into the amusement game is achieved by pressing buttons or a touch screen in the same manner as discussed above for gaming devices, but without of course the wagering step.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">In the prior art, electronic machines have been provided as amusement devices or as gaming machines, but usually not both. Rather, the electronic machines have been used for a dedicated single purpose, i.e., either amusement or gaming but not both.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0008">It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system incorporating a dual mode gaming device which is selectably configurable as a gaming device on the one hand, or as an electronic amusement game device on the other hand.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">It is another object of the present invention to provide a dual mode gaming device as described above, in which switching between the gaming and amusement modes is achieved automatically, based on geographic position or coordinates information.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">It is another object of the present invention to provide an electronic machine and method used solely for amusement purposes, and in which scoring can be arbitrarily increased by a player to prevent the electronic amusement machine from being considered or used as a gambling machine.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">It is another object of the present invention to provide novel mounting arrangements for electronic gaming/amusement machines for incorporation into vehicles that traverse jurisdictional boundaries, such as boats, airplanes, buses and/or trains.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved touch screen control system for input of selection information into a computer system, which can be a gaming/amusement device in accordance with other aspects of the present invention but which need not be.</p>
    <p num="p-0013">Briefly, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, there is provided a system and method in which electronic game machines are switchable between an amusement mode and a gaming mode. Player input means are provided which can be in the form of knobs, buttons or touch screen areas on a CRT or LCD screen. In the amusement mode, the game machines include circuitry which keeps score of a game, with the score simply being a number or other indicia of relative success in playing the game. In the gaming mode, either a system controller or the electronic game machines themselves have registers for maintaining an indication of player credit balance, and for incrementing or decrementing the player credit balance in accordance with the outcome of games played by the player in the gaming mode.</p>
    <p num="p-0014">In accordance with various embodiments of the present invention, the switching of a machine between amusement and gaming modes can be done by the player, by the system operator such as by the crew of a boat or airplane on which the machines are provided, or can be done automatically by the system in accordance with geographic coordinates or the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0015">In accordance with additional other aspects of the present invention, a touch screen is provided for player input, and an improved control system is provided for the touch screen system for minimizing errors and missed inputs.</p>

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading> <p num="p-0026">Turning now to a consideration of the drawing figures, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of one embodiment of a dual mode amusement/gaming device system in accordance with one aspect of the present invention. There are many jurisdictions where gaming is legal, and many jurisdictions where gaming is not legal. Vehicles or passenger conveyances such as boats, airplanes, buses and trains, are capable of and do carry passengers in various jurisdictions and from one geographic position in one jurisdiction to another geographic position in another jurisdiction, including some where gaming or gambling is legal and some where it is not. For example, in the case of a boat or ocean going vessel, it is a common situation that certain segments of a voyage may take place in geographic areas or jurisdictions where gambling is not legal (such as within a three-mile or nine mile coastal limit of the United States) and other parts of the voyage may take place in geographic areas or jurisdictions where gambling or gaming is legal, i.e. on the high seas. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the system operator of a gaming or amusement machine is able to ensure that the machine is not viewed as a gambling machine by the authorities in jurisdictions where gambling is illegal, by providing a mechanism for preventing the machine from being operated in a gaming or gambling mode while in such jurisdictions. Thus, in accordance with this aspect of the invention the operating mode of a machine may be switched between a gaming (or gambling) mode in which wagers are placed by a player, payoffs are made, etc., and an amusement mode, in which no gambling can occur and instead an electronic machine only provides a score to a player to provide feedback to the player on how well he or she is playing the game. In accordance with the broadest aspects of the invention, a machine can be switched between gaming and amusement modes by the player, by the operator of the system or vessel on which the system is provided, such as a ship's crew, or even automatically switched in accordance with the vessel's geographic location as provided by positioning determining means such as a global satellite positioning system (GPS) or a Loran system.</p>
    <p num="p-0027">Turning to a detailed consideration of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a gaming machine generally indicated by reference numeral <b>11</b> is provided. The gaming machine can be any of a wide variety of types, such as poker machines, blackjack machines, roulette machines, etc. Such gaming device machines are well known in the art and the particular game provided on the machine is not important to an understanding of the present invention. Such known machines involve mechanisms for receiving player input during game play, with the player input being diagrammatically indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by box <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0028">Player input to an electronic amusement or gaming machine can be provided through buttons or switches provided on the machine as known in the art, but in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the invention is provided through touching button or box areas provided on a CRT or LCD screen, also in a manner well known in the computer and game art. Use of a touch screen facilitates player interaction, and there are no buttons or switches to become fouled due to spilling drinks, etc., which is of course a concern given the environment in which most electronic amusement and gaming machines are located.</p>
    <p num="p-0029">The machine <b>11</b> is provided with the usual scoring circuitry illustrated by box <b>13</b>, which can function while the machine is either in a gaming mode or an amusement mode. The scoring circuitry or software is of course dependent on the particular game or games provided on the machine, and appropriate circuitry or software for the various games is well known.</p>
    <p num="p-0030">An account balance register indicated by box <b>14</b> is provided for use in connection with the operation of the machine or device in the gaming or gambling mode, and the account balance register <b>14</b> is suitably interconnected with the scoring circuitry <b>13</b> to increment or decrement the account balance when the machine is in a gaming mode in accordance with the success or lack of success of the player. Suitable account balance circuitry or software arrangements are also known in the art, with electronic machines used for gaming in casinos and the like providing a “credit balance” indication or talley. The account balance register can be incorporated into each machine, or can alternatively or additionally be incorporated into the system operator controller <b>20</b> for providing an account balance for each player at a central location.</p>
    <p num="p-0031">Naturally a mechanism or arrangement needs to be provided for accepting wagers from the player. Box <b>16</b> is intended to refer to a suitable arrangement for accepting wagers or player selected increases to an account balance for operation of the machine <b>11</b> in a gaming mode. Box <b>16</b> can be any suitable arrangement for accepting credit cards, where a credit card is debited in accordance with a pre-selected amount by the player. Alternatively, tokens which can be purchased by the player can be input into arrangement <b>16</b> for wagering or increasing the account balance register <b>14</b> as well as cash. The input of cash, tokens or credit card debit can be with regard to one wager on one game to be played, or as a general increase to a player's account balance from which individual wagers are later debited or subtracted by the player. Also, of course, funds for wagering can be accepted at the control location system controller <b>20</b>, where the funds are translated into an account balance.</p>
    <p num="p-0032">Conversely, when a player has concluded a gaming or gambling session and desires to “cash out,” a suitable mechanism or arrangement is provided for the machine settling up with the player. Box <b>17</b> is intended to refer to such an arrangement. Box <b>17</b> can be any suitable arrangement for crediting a credit card account or the like with whatever is in the account balance register <b>14</b> at the time a player “cashes out.” Alternatively, tokens can be output to the player which can be redeemed at a cashier or the like for cash, or arrangement <b>17</b> can be provided to simply output cash in accordance with the account balance register <b>14</b> when the player cashes out. Suitable arrangements are well known for causing a credit in a credit card account as well as for outputting tokens or cash in accordance with a credit balance when a player “cashes out.” As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the account balance register is interconnected with both of the boxes <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> for registering inputs of credit cards, tokens or cash, and for controlling payouts of the machine in credit card credits, tokens or cash. Also, of course, in installations where a player's account balance is maintained at a central location in the system controller <b>20</b>, such “cashing out” can take place at the central location rather than at an individual machine.</p>
    <p num="p-0033">As mentioned at the outset, in accordance with this one aspect of the invention, the device or machine <b>11</b> is selectably switchable between a gaming mode in which game play results not only in scoring kept track of by traditional scoring circuitry <b>13</b>, but also incrementing or decrementing the account balance register <b>14</b> of the player in accordance with the player's success or lack thereof in the game play. In the amusement mode, the scoring circuitry <b>13</b> functions to indicate the success or lack of success of the player in playing the game, but no gaming or gambling occurs because game play does not result in any incrementing or decrementing of the account balance register <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0034">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> a switching means <b>18</b> is provided for switching the machine or device <b>11</b> between gaming mode and amusement mode functions. The switching device <b>18</b> can obviously be manually operated, either by a player or by the system operator of the machines <b>11</b>, such as a ship's crew in the case of an ocean going vessel.</p>
    <p num="p-0035"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also illustrates an alternative arrangement in which switching between gaming mode and amusement mode automatically occurs when the vehicle or vessel on which the gaming device or machine <b>11</b> is located transitions from geographic positions or jurisdictions where gaming is legal to jurisdictions where gaming is illegal and vice versa. In accordance with this alternative embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a navigation receiver <b>19</b> is provided. Navigation receivers, such as GPS and Loran receivers, are well known in the art, and can provide very accurate geographic position indications over most if not all of the earth. Loran navigation receivers have been in use for a long time on airplanes and boats, and are known to be very accurate position determining means at least in areas adequately served by Loran transmission chains. As is also well known, GPS receivers are quite accurate in determining positioning fixes for civilian applications over most of the earth (even when subject to selective degradation by military authorities), particularly if the GPS systems are provided with differential position circuitry. GPS systems with differential correction facility can be used to accurately locate a geographic position on the earth to within 10 or 15 feet or less.</p>
    <p num="p-0036">The navigation receiver <b>19</b> provides a geographic position output signal to a legal position switch control <b>21</b>, with the geographic position output signal representing the position of the vehicle or vessel (e.g. in terms of latitude and longitude) on which the gaming/amusement devices <b>11</b> are located. A software table or the like indicated by box <b>22</b> is provided which is preprogrammed with latitudes and longitudes where gaming is illegal (e.g., within three miles or in some instances nine miles of a shoreline), and latitudes and longitudes where gaming is permitted (i.e., outside the coastal limit). The legal position switch control <b>21</b> compares the geographic position as reported by the navigation receiver <b>19</b> to the software table or the like of legal latitude and longitude geographic positions provided by box <b>22</b>, and uses the result of the comparison to determine whether or not the switching means <b>18</b> is switched to the position allowing the gaming mode of operation or whether it is switched and restricted to the amusement mode of operation.</p>
    <p num="p-0037">The machine <b>11</b> is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as including a communications component <b>15</b> interconnected with a system operator controller <b>20</b>. This facilitates two-way communication between a system operator or display, as might be required for certain gaming functions or activities. Also, where game device <b>11</b> is situated on a vessel or conveyance, such as in a lounge, for example, the communications capability can be useful in the player ordering drinks, food, or merchandise. Thus, in a manner known in the art, the machine <b>11</b> can be provided with an ordering mode, with menus of selectable items provided by an on line or residently stored catalog, with appropriate player input through a touch screen or the like for placing orders. Payment for the orders can be automated by credit card, token or cash input by the player into arrangement <b>16</b>, or payment can be achieved through a debit to the player's account balance register <b>14</b>, maintained either locally at a machine or at the system controller.</p>
    <p num="p-0038">There is some concern on the part of governmental authorities that even in geographic areas where gaming is not permitted, that so-called “amusement” machines used in lounges and the like, are in fact used for illegal gambling. In reality, any electronic game machine which provides a score, whether measured in dollars, points, or whatever, can be used for gambling, so long as there is a way for the operator or owner of the machine to “clear” or wipe out a score. That is, the operator or owner of the electronic machine either receives the wagers or the wagers result from money input into the machine and winning wagers are paid off in accordance with the “amusement” score indicated on the machine, instead of the machine itself making payoffs. Although this kind of arrangement is in fact, illegal, there seems to be no question but that it occurs. This has resulted in consideration by some governmental authorities of banning altogether “amusement” machines in which a score is provided, and is capable of being cleared or “wiped out.”</p>
    <p num="p-0039">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a means can be provided to ensure that an “amusement” machine, whether a dedicated amusement machine or a switchable machine being operated in amusement mode, cannot be used for gambling. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a dashed line labeled with reference numeral <b>25</b>, extending from the player input means <b>12</b> to scoring circuitry <b>13</b>. This refers to an arbitrary player increment to the scoring circuitry, which can be activated at any time the machine is in amusement mode (or anytime with a dedicated “amusement” machine) to increment the score. That is, at any time during play of an amusement game, the player is permitted to arbitrarily increase the score indicated by the machine, i.e. by 100 points, 100 dollars, or whatever. With such an arrangement there is no practical way that the machine could be used for illegal gambling, subject as the score is to being arbitrarily increased at any time by the player.</p>
    <p num="p-0040">Moreover, as mentioned above, this feature of the present invention is equally applicable to machines operating in a dedicated fashion in “amusement” applications, as well as the switchable machine shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> being operated in amusement mode.</p>
    <p num="p-0041">As mentioned previously, the preferred mode of providing player input to a gaming device or machine in accordance with the present invention is through use of a touch screen provided on a CRT or LCD screen. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, an improved arrangement is provided for minimizing errors and ambiguities which can arise in connection with the operation of touch screens. Although the improved arrangement and method of this aspect of the invention can be and preferably is applied to touch screens provided on CRT or LCD screens of gaming/amusement machines in accordance with other aspects of this invention, this aspect of the present invention is not limited to such applications. Rather, the touch screen aspects of this invention can be applied to any CRT or LCD screen of any computer based system to provide input by a person to the system.</p>
    <p num="p-0042">Touch screens are very popular as a user interface not only with respect to gaming or amusement devices, but by airline and rental car reservation terminals and other computer applications for use by players or customers who may not be totally computer literate to issue commands to computers by pressing on images (or buttons) provided on the screen. The screens are usually CRTs, but could appropriately be LCDs or any other type of computer screens, the basic technology for which is well known. Current touch screen applications require that large button areas (i.e., “touch” areas) be provided on the screens as well as a relatively large spacing between buttons due to the inherent ambiguities of the touch point and the release point reported to a processor by the touched screen. The ambiguities arise because known touch screens typically report essentially the centroid of the fingerprint area. This area is quite small at the moment of contact of a finger with the screen, and its exact location is not accurately predictable by the average user of the touch screen. Since, for the usual touch screen buttons, a command will not be issued unless the point of first touch of the finger to the screen and the point of release of the finger from the screen occur within the bounds of the same button on the screen, buttons must accordingly be large and well spaced to give the user a reasonable chance of issuing the desired command without jabbing at the screen a number of times or issuing the wrong command.</p>
    <p num="p-0043">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a software controlled method and system is provided which issues commands based solely on the finger release point. Furthermore, once the screen is touched, the software responds by highlighting each button “slid over” by the finger and ultimately issues commands when the touch is released over a button which was slid onto. This allows the user to correct for a misaligned initial touch by sliding his or her finger while being visually guided, through feedback from the highlighting of the buttons.</p>
    <p num="p-0044"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram which illustrates the basic operation of the touch screen aspect of the method and system of the present invention. A touch screen <b>26</b> is provided, such as on a CRT or LCD screen as is known. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, reference numerals <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> and <b>29</b> are used to refer to screen buttons. The oval area <b>31</b> refers to a full touch fingerprint, and the smaller oval <b>32</b> refers to the centroid of the fingerprint as the finger is being lifted. The larger dotted rectangle <b>33</b> represents the enlarged sensitive area in accordance with this aspect of the present invention of the middle button <b>28</b>. In accordance with the present invention this enlarged area is considered “sensitive” because the finger last contacted the screen within this button <b>28</b>. The method and system of the present invention would report the release in the center button <b>28</b> because of the “hysteresis” rectangle <b>33</b> even though the actual point of release is over the left button as illustrated by the oval <b>32</b>. In order to invoke the left button <b>27</b>, the user must slide his or her finger off the center button <b>28</b> far enough to be clear of the dotted rectangle <b>33</b>. This would be confirmed in operation by the unhighlighting of the center button <b>28</b> and the highlighting of the left button <b>27</b> on the touch screen. At this time, the sensitive area for the center button <b>28</b> would shrink and the sensitive area for the left button <b>27</b> would be enlarged in a similar fashion to the “hysteresis” area or dotted rectangle <b>33</b>, but this time centered over the left button <b>27</b>. When the user then releases his or her touch anywhere in the enlarged sensitive rectangle of the left button, the left button is invoked.</p>
    <p num="p-0045">Turning now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is shown a flow chart for the software for controlling operation of a touch screen in accordance with the method and system of this aspect of the present invention. Thus, a touch signal input <b>34</b> results in a comparison in decision block <b>35</b> as to whether or not the touch signal is in the left button. If not, then the comparison proceeds in decision block <b>36</b> as to whether the touch signal is in the center button and, if not, decision <b>37</b> decides whether or not the touch signal is in the right button. Similar decision block steps suitably occur for each of the various buttons which may be provided on a touch screen. The same type of comparison or evaluation keeps being conducted if it is determined that the touch signal is not in the right button through decision block <b>38</b> which recycles the method back to the left button, center button, right button, etc. If the finger is not still touching, nothing is invoked and the method exits the routine. If the finger is still touching anywhere on the touch screen, the same sort of comparison continues as to whether the touch signal is in the left button, center button, right button, etc.</p>
    <p num="p-0046">Assume, for example, that the evaluation as to whether the touch signals in the left button which occurs in decision block <b>35</b> results in a yes output. Decision block <b>41</b> does an evaluation of whether or not the finger is still touching. If yes, decision block <b>42</b> highlights the left button and unhighlights any other buttons. Then, an evaluation is made in decision block <b>43</b> as to whether or not the finger touching is in the enlarged left button. This is the “hysteresis” function referred to above and which is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by the dotted area <b>33</b>. If the finger is still touching in the enlarged left button, looping occurs back to decision block <b>41</b>. If the finger is not still touching as determined by the decision block <b>41</b>, decision block <b>44</b> results in invoking the left button and exiting the routine. If decision block <b>43</b> determines that the finger is not touching in the enlarged left button, then the routine cycles to decision block <b>36</b> for the center button. Decision blocks <b>46</b> through <b>49</b> associated with the functions related to the center button function in the same way as decision blocks <b>41</b> through <b>44</b> function with regard to the left button. If decision block <b>48</b> determines that the finger is still touching, but not in the enlarged center button, then cycling of the routine proceeds to decision block <b>37</b> to determine whether or not the finger touching is in the right button. Decision blocks <b>51</b> through <b>54</b> associated with functioning of the right button probably function in the same way as decision blocks <b>46</b> through <b>49</b> associated with the center button and decision blocks <b>41</b> through <b>44</b> associated with the left button. Of course, equivalent software decision blocks are provided for each of the many touch screen buttons or selections provided in accordance with different screen displays on the machine.</p>
    <p num="p-0047">The arrangement illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> results in improved functioning for any kind of touch screen, using both the slide-on feature and the hysteresis feature of the present invention. Such a touch screen is, of course, very efficient in connection with use in gaming devices or machines as well as amusement devices or machines, as well as machines in accordance with the present invention switchable between amusement and gaming modes. The touch screen method and system of the present invention, however, is not limited to gaming or amusement devices, but is applicable to any kind of environment and apparatus in which a touch screen is used with respect to a CRT or LCD or any other type of touch screen for player or operator input or selection.</p>
    <p num="p-0048">It is known to provide “drop-in” gaming or amusement devices, typically mounted in bars or in tables in lounge areas. Such equipment, which is basically a computer, is subject to a fair amount of abuse due to drinks being spilled, things being dropped, etc. on the computer screen. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a method and arrangement are provided for fixing a computer display device, such as an LCD panel which would be relatively thin, or such other more or less flat panel type of displays, under a transparent surface, such as a table top, so that the display can be viewed through the transparent surface, but the transparent table top is still intact and usable for any other table functions, such as holding food and drink, etc.</p>
    <p num="p-0049">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there is illustrated a table base <b>56</b> supporting a transparent table top <b>57</b> which can be transparent glass or plastic. A player or customer illustrated by reference numeral <b>58</b> is illustrated as being seated in a chair <b>59</b> at the edge of tabletop <b>57</b>. A computer display and input device <b>61</b> is advantageously mounted through mounting means <b>62</b> to the underside of tabletop <b>57</b>. The dotted lines shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrate the computer display device <b>61</b> as being rotatable to a viewing or playing position underneath tabletop <b>57</b>. The computer display device <b>61</b> can have a computer or gaming device input arrangement such as a touch screen, with the player <b>58</b> being able to provide inputs to the device through touching appropriate buttons on the touch screen while viewing same through the transparent surface of tabletop <b>57</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0050">If desired, the computer display and input device <b>61</b> can also incorporate an identification device, such as a magnetic stripe reader for credit cards, through an appropriate card reader arrangement as already referred to in connection with FIG. <b>1</b>. Through use of such an arrangement, passengers on an oceangoing vessel, for an example, can order food and drink, purchase items from menus or catalogs provided on the computer display device <b>61</b>, as well as gamble at their tables, without impairing the normal use of the tabletop. Suitable communication connection between the computer display device <b>61</b> and a central location, such as a system operator, can be made through appropriate wiring <b>60</b> run through the table base or the like. At the same time, the computer equipment is protected from spills and mechanical abuse. Such an arrangement as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is also useful in lounge areas on a boat for an example, as it gets double duty from the limited floor space available on a boat. That is, a tabletop is provided which can be used to serve food and drink, while at the same time being functional, if desired by a patron or a player, for placing orders for food or drink or merchandise, as well as utilizing an amusement device or for gaming play if the ship is located in an area where gaming is legal.</p>
    <p num="p-0051">In the context of the present invention, many different mounting arrangements are suitable for the computer display device <b>61</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a front elevational view of one acceptable mounting arrangement with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> being a side elevation of the arrangement. Basically, a mounting bracket or pair of mounting brackets <b>66</b> are provided descending downwardly from the bottom surface of tabletop <b>57</b> and having a friction screw or bolt <b>67</b> passing through an opening in the bracket <b>66</b> and screwed into an edge surface of the computer display device <b>61</b>. By loosing the screw <b>67</b>, computer display device <b>61</b> can be tilted or angled downwardly, with the screw <b>67</b> being again tightened to retain the device in virtually any desired position. Alternatively, a screw and friction washer arrangement can be used. Of course, many other arrangements are also suitable for mounting the computer display device to the bottom of a tabletop such that it can positioned for use by a player or operator seated at the edge of the tabletop and viewing the computer display device through the transparent tabletop. This could be piano hinge arrangements, hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders for holding the computer display device in whatever angled position it is placed in, cams with detents etc. Many such suitable arrangements are known in the art.</p>
    <p num="p-0052">It should be clear that the aspects of the present invention enabling selective switching of an electronic game apparatus between a gaming mode and a strictly amusement mode, for respective use in jurisdictions where gaming is legal and for use for amusement purposes only where it is not legal, is particularly applicable to vehicles or vessels, such as boats, airplanes, trains and buses, that transport occupants through various geographic jurisdictions in their operation.</p>
    <p num="p-0053"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> illustrate still another aspect of the present invention in which a computer display device such as an LCD panel, with touch screen or the like for player input, is mounted in a convenient manner in a seating arrangement for a vehicle. Typically, vehicles such as airplanes or buses have a plurality of rows of seats, with one of the seats illustrated generally by reference numeral <b>71</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. Space and weight are very important considerations, particularly on airplanes. Efforts so far to provide computers for passenger use on airplanes involved the use of a small liquid crystal display device for the computer monitor, usually mounted in the back of the airplane seats. Of course, often meal trays are also mounted in the back of airplane seats, and the computer monitor has to share space in the airplane seat back. The small screen is, of course, useful to minimize weight and space occupied, but severely limits the utility of the computer because of the small display area available and the inability to position the monitor to the passenger's preference. The small area that would result for a touch screen results in the usual provision of a separate input device for the user-the screen is just simply too small for providing touch screen capabilities.</p>
    <p num="p-0054"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> illustrate providing a space efficient and relatively large size computer monitor with touch screen input in the back of passenger seats on vehicles such as airplanes in a manner that they can be adjusted in position in accordance with passenger preference. In the drawings, seat <b>71</b> has a seat portion <b>72</b>, a back portion <b>73</b>, and suitable legs or mountings <b>74</b> to fix the seat to the vehicle. In accordance with the invention, a cutout portion <b>75</b> is provided in seat back <b>73</b>, the purpose of which is to receive and serve as a storage area for a tray/monitor assembly generally indicated by reference numeral <b>76</b>. The tray/monitor assembly <b>76</b> is configured to have a thin panel computer monitor <b>77</b> preferably incorporating touch screen input means, combined back to back with a meal tray panel <b>78</b>, as shown in the drawings. The meal tray panel <b>78</b> can be flat, or can be provided with one or more depressions for holding cups, etc., in place as known in the art. The computer monitor <b>77</b> and tray panel <b>78</b> can be held together in assembled relationship by any convenient means such as screws or the like (not shown), or could both be held in a thin frame or the like in assembled relationship (not shown).</p>
    <p num="p-0055">The tray/monitor assembly <b>76</b> is mounted to seatback <b>73</b> by a pair of swing arms <b>81</b> mounted to either side of seatback <b>73</b> by an adjustable locking assembly <b>82</b>, and mounted to the sides of tray/monitor assembly <b>76</b> by adjustable locking assembly <b>83</b>. The adjustable locking assemblies <b>82</b> and <b>83</b> can be of any convenient and known configuration, and one suitable construction is the same friction locking knob assembly as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> in connection with discussion of another aspect of this invention. Alternatively, the locking assemblies <b>82</b> and <b>83</b> can be known configurations of cams with detents, spring loaded pins which fit into recesses for locking, etc. Many suitable configurations are known to those in the art, and the particular configuration is not part of the essence of this invention. In any event, the purpose of adjustable locking assembly <b>82</b> is to permit the swing arms <b>81</b> and attached tray/monitor assembly <b>76</b> to pivot in the direction indicated by reference line A—A, from a storage position where it is located within cutout portion <b>75</b>, to any desired position. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the swing arms <b>81</b> and tray/monitor assembly in a horizontal position, but it should be clear that the purpose is to be able to fix the swing arms <b>81</b> and attached tray/monitor assembly <b>76</b> in any desired intermediate position.</p>
    <p num="p-0056">The adjustable locking assembly <b>83</b> can likewise be of any suitable configuration, as discussed above in connection with adjustable locking assemblies <b>82</b>. The purpose of the adjustable locking assemblies <b>83</b> is to permit in the range of 180 degrees or more rotation of and locking in place of tray/monitor assembly <b>76</b>, and preferably even a greater degree range of rotation, even 360 degrees. Reference line B—B in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is intended to be a representation of the permitted rotation of the tray/monitor assembly <b>76</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0057">Through rotation and fixing of tray/monitor assembly <b>76</b>, either the tray panel <b>78</b> or the computer monitor <b>77</b> can be positioned for use by the passenger, by rotation of the assembly <b>76</b> in its mountings <b>83</b> and fixing the locking assemblies <b>83</b> with assembly <b>76</b> in a desired position. Note that through adjustable locking assemblies <b>82</b> and <b>83</b>, the tray/monitor assembly <b>76</b> can be positioned in a wide range of possible desired positions for use by a passenger.</p>
    <p num="p-0058">As previously mentioned, the computer monitor <b>77</b> is preferably an LCD computer screen, or other substantially flat panel type computer screen, for reasons of space economy in combining same in a seat back with a tray panel. It is also preferred that the computer monitor <b>77</b> incorporate a touch screen for input to the computer by a passenger. Suitable power and communication connections can be made to the computer monitor <b>77</b> through wiring extending through swing arms <b>81</b>, seat back <b>73</b>, seat bottom <b>72</b>, and legs or mountings <b>74</b>, as indicated diagrammatically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> by the dashed line labeled <b>85</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0059">In the drawings the computer monitor <b>77</b> can be just a monitor and input device, connected for computing or communication purposes by wiring <b>85</b> to a computer or the like. Alternatively, the computer monitor <b>77</b> can be a complete computer or terminal, with power being supplied by wiring <b>85</b> or even by on-board batteries provided in the computer monitor <b>77</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0060">The computer monitor <b>77</b> can serve a variety of purposes. In addition to placing at a passenger's disposal general purpose computing power if desired, the computer monitor <b>77</b> can be a gaming or amusement device, or serve as a communications input for transmitting faxes or the like. It can also be programmed in a known fashion and used by a passenger to order refreshments from attendants on the vehicle, or to order merchandise for delivery while on the vehicle or upon arrival at a destination, all through communications provided by wiring <b>85</b>. An on-line or memory resident catalog can be provided for display on computer monitor <b>77</b> to facilitate such ordering and sales to passengers, in a manner already well known in the computer arts.</p>
    <p num="p-0061">It should be clear from the foregoing description and drawings that the present invention has a variety of facets, usable in combination or subcombinations or individually, and it is intended by the claims appended hereto to cover all such uses.</p>
