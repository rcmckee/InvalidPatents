The control module includes a thin film printed circuit with non-contact speed sensing of a flywheel to more accurately set the target speed and control transfer kinetic energy thereof to a fastener, achieving a desired depth regardless of variations in component performance and battery voltage. The printed circuit also includes long service life thin film switches for responding to trigger and safety inputs. Furthermore, the control module responds to a user speed selection and to preset speed selection ranges to reconfigure the controls as appropriate to constraints of a fastener drive assembly and to user preferences.</div>

<heading>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading> <p num="p-0002">This application is a divisional of U.S. Non-Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 10/027,767, filed Dec. 20, 2001, now abandoned, entitled CONTROL MODULE FOR FLYWHEL OPERATED HAND TOOL.</p>
  <p num="p-0003">This application claims the priority of Provisional Patent Applicant Ser. No. 60/258,022, filed on Dec. 22, 2000 and incorporates herein, by reference, the totality of the invention disclosure therein.</p>
  <p num="p-0004">This application is related to three commonly-owned, co-pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications filed on even date herewith and respectively titled, “FLYWHEEL OPERATED TOOL” to Conrad Gravis, et al; “FLYWHEEL OPERATED NAILER” to John Burke, et al; and “RETURN MECHANISM FOR A CYCLICAL TOOL” to Kevin Harper, et al. This application further relates to the commonly-owned, co-pending U.S. non-provisional patent application to Shane Adams, et al., filed on even date herewith and titled “SPEED CONTROLLER FOR FLYWHEEL OPERATED HAND TOOL”.</p>
<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0005">This invention generally relates to a hand-held electromechanical fastener driving tool, and more particularly to a fastener driving tool having an inertial member for imparting kinetic energy to drive a fastener into a work piece.</p>
  <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0006">In the past, where relatively large energy impulses have been required to operate a fastener driving tool, such as an industrial nailer or stapler, it has been common practice to power such tool pneumatically. Such tools are capable of driving a 3″ or longer nail, or staple, into framing wood such as 2×4s, for example. However, pneumatic driving tools require an on-site air compressor, which is often unavailable or not desired. Also, dragging the pneumatic umbilical is often an impediment to the user.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">Corded AC electrical fastener driving tools are often used instead of pneumatic power since electrical power is more often available than air compressors. In particular, much effort has been expended in the prior art in providing heavy duty, high powered, fastener driving tools employing a flywheel as a means of delivering kinetic energy sufficient to drive a heavy duty fasteners. Examples of such systems are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,042,036; 4,121,745; 4,204,622; 4,298,072; and 5,511,715. Use of a flywheel is an attempt to limit the large current draws to actuate a solenoid to drive a fastener. A DC motor is activated over a non-instantaneous period and then the kinetic energy thus developed in the flywheel is clutched to the driver in an “energy dump”.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">While such corded electrical fastener driving tools may perform well, in many instances an AC outlet is not available. Even if an AC outlet is available, many users find dragging the electrical cord to be an impediment to use. To address these preferences, it is further known to employ a portable power source such as a battery, such as solenoid-operated fastener driving tools. These portable fastener driving tools are primarily used in light-duty applications such as in driving one inch brad nails, for example, rather than the larger 2″ to 4″ staples or nails used in framing.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">One approach to an efficient portable electrically driven tool is a multiple impact tool, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,625,903, wherein a linear inertial member is repeatedly raised by a cam against a compression spring and released to impact a fastener. An electrical motor and portable battery pack are operated in a more efficient manner by running the motor for a period of time rather than providing a surge of power to a device such as a solenoid. The relatively small amount of energy stored in the spring each cycle typically requires a large number of impacts to drive a staple or nail into a workpiece. During this time, the user is required to maintain an appropriate position and force on the fasten and to gauge the appropriate length of time to achieve the desired depth. However, while the multiple impact tool is efficient and effective in driving fasteners, some users prefer a single driving action comparable to pyrotechnic or compressed air systems. The multiple impact tools also can damage a wood surface due to the vibrations the tool generates while stroking.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">It would be desirable to use a battery to power a flywheel operated hand tool to provide a portable fastener driver that can drive larger fasteners in a single drive. However, using a battery has been thwarted by a number of challenges. First, each specific application generally requires a fastener drive assembly and motor customized for the type of fastener. In particular, the size of flywheel, the desired rotary speed of the flywheel, and the type of electric motor to accelerate the flywheel to the desired rotary speed are generally specifically sized for the type of fastener and work piece into which the fastener is typically driven. Thus, each specific application was thought to require a custom control module, with the increased costs of design, manufacture and support.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">Even assuming that various types of fasteners could then be used with a family of flywheel operated hand tools, each tool would suffer the disadvantages inherent in using battery power. The battery voltage varies as a function of the amount of charge remaining and the amount of electrical current being drawn. The rotary speed of the flywheel varies with the battery voltage, and thus the depth of drive of the fastener would unacceptably vary. The generally known controllers for corded flywheel operated hand tools are unable to accommodate these power variations.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">Furthermore, even for a specific application, the desired depth of drive is affected by the type of work piece into which the fastener is driven and to user preferences. However, flywheel operated hand tools rely upon a given amount of kinetic energy imparted by the flywheel to achieve a desired depth of travel. Thus, when the work piece is more or less dense, the depth of the drive will vary. Moreover, the user may prefer in some instances to sink the fastener below the plane of the work piece or to leave the head of the fastener exposed for easy removal.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">Other types of hand tools, such a pneumatic powered hand tools, generally rely on driving the fastener to a specific position in order to achieve a desired depth. For example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,679,719, 5,732,870 and 5,918,788 a control module is described that advantageously determines the mode of operation for the trigger. In particular, a microprocessor provided additional capabilities by receiving two signal inputs initiated by the user and by selectively activating an electronic solenoid in response thereto. Although the increased functionality of the control module in such pneumatic tools has advantages, these control modules are not responsive to changes in operating conditions to vary the depth of drive.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">Other tools employing a rotary member (e.g., drill) generally require the user to determine the proper speed of the tool. The user provides the closed loop control of the tool, monitoring the tool for binding and proper operation and depressing the trigger an appropriate amount. However, consistent operation of the tool is thus dependent upon the skill level and attentiveness of the user. Due to the speed in which a fastener must be driven into the workpiece, the user would only learn after the fact whether the rotary member (in this case a flywheel) was accelerated to an appropriate speed prior to firing.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">Therefore, a significant need exists for a control module that drives medium and large fasteners into a work piece with a single driving action, yet has the increased portability of battery power. It would be further desired to have such a tool that consistently provides a depth of fastener regardless of the state of charge of the battery. It would be yet further desired to have a control module readily adapted to a family of hand tools.</p>
  <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0016">These and other problems in the prior art are addressed by a control module that is responsive to a rotary speed of a rotational member of an electrically powered hand tool and is responsive to an adjustable target speed for the rotational member. Thereby, the control module more consistently controls the hand tool, avoiding human error and the inconvenience of relying upon the user to modulate the speed of the tool.</p>
  <p num="p-0017">In one aspect of the invention, a control module for a hand tool includes a speed setting that is used for presetting the control module to an operating range of the intended rotational member of the hand tool. Thus, the control module is readily adjusted to the operating environment, using the speed setting as a target for comparing a sensed speed.</p>
  <p num="p-0018">In another aspect of the invention, a method of controlling a fastener-driving tool enforces a user input sequence to ensure that a fastener is driven into a workpiece. In particular, a safety signal is received from a safety switch indicating a nose assembly of the tool is against a workpiece. A safety time-out value is accessed. The duration of depression of the safety signal is timed. Then, the tool is activated to drive a fastener in response to receiving a trigger signal from a trigger switch before the timed duration of the safety signal exceeds the safety time-out value. By so enforcing this sequence, a user is less likely to inadvertently drive a fastener in instances where the trigger is inadvertently squeezed and the tool contacts a surface.</p>
  <p num="p-0019">In yet another aspect of the invention, an electrically powered hand tool is provided a reliable interface to a control module through use of a thin film switch interface to user controls (e.g., safety and trigger) and through use of noncontact speed sensing.</p>

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0049">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, wherein like numbers refer to like components throughout the several views, a portable flywheel operated hand tool, depicted as a hand-held nailing tool <b>10</b>, includes a control system <b>12</b> that advantageously provides consistent speed control throughout a range of operating conditions. In particular, the nailing tool <b>10</b> generally comprises a housing or main body <b>14</b> enclosing a fastener drive assembly <b>16</b> and a control module <b>18</b>, and further includes and a gripping handle <b>20</b>. Attached to the end of handle <b>20</b> is a removable, rechargeable battery <b>22</b> for providing the necessary electrical energy to operate a DC motor <b>24</b> and a solenoid <b>26</b> of the fastener drive assembly <b>16</b>, as well as the electrical control module <b>18</b>. Unlike generally known batteries that are required to handle large current influxes (e.g., Nickel Cadmium), the present invention advantageously may utilize other types of batteries (e.g., Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH), lithium Polymers).</p>
  <p num="p-0050">The DC motor <b>24</b>, when accelerated by the control module <b>18</b>, turns a flywheel <b>28</b> to build kinetic energy in the form of rotational inertia. Thereafter, the control module <b>18</b> actuates the solenoid <b>26</b> in response to user inputs and a sensed parameter of rotational speed of the flywheel <b>28</b> to impart the kinetic energy of the flywheel <b>28</b> to a fastener, which is described in further detail below</p>
  <p num="p-0051">A user input to the nailing tool <b>10</b> are depicted as a trigger <b>30</b> of the handle <b>20</b>, which mechanically communicates with the control module <b>18</b> via a trigger linkage <b>32</b>. Another user input is depicted as a safety device <b>34</b> of a nose assembly <b>36</b> that mechanically communicates with the control module <b>18</b> via a safety linkage <b>38</b>. Yet another user input is depicted as a speed adjust knob <b>40</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">The nailing tool <b>10</b> includes a fastener supplying magazine assembly <b>42</b>, which is typically attached to the main body <b>14</b> and handle <b>20</b>, as illustrated, for supplying a strip of fasteners (not shown) to the nose assembly <b>36</b>. It will be appreciated that the control system <b>12</b> may be advantageously operated with different types of magazine assemblies <b>42</b> to include different numbers, types and sizes of fasteners. Moreover, the control system <b>12</b> advantageously enhances use of indexed magazine assemblies, as will be described in more detail below.</p>
  <p num="h-0007">Control Module.</p>
  <p num="p-0053">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the control module <b>18</b> of the control system <b>12</b> advantageously enhances reliability, design flexibility, ease of assembly, and performance of the nailing tool <b>10</b>. In particular, the control module <b>18</b> includes user speed selection capability, depicted as a potentiometer <b>44</b> that is adjusted by knob <b>40</b>. By being responsive to the user speed adjustment knob <b>40</b> enables the nailing tool <b>10</b> to adjust a target speed of the flywheel <b>28</b>. In addition to any preset target speed of the control module <b>18</b>, the user may adjust the knob <b>40</b> to compensate for variations in the workpiece or the desired depth of fastener insertion.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">The control module <b>18</b> further includes a thin film printed circuit <b>46</b> that provides an extremely reliable electrical interface to the mechanical user inputs of the safety device <b>34</b> and the trigger <b>30</b>. Moreover, the printed circuit <b>46</b> is readily adapted to various three-dimensional orientations with the support of a molded bridge <b>48</b>. Thus, a trigger switch <b>50</b> and a safety switch <b>52</b> are readily positioned to receive the respective trigger and safety mechanical linkages <b>32</b>, <b>36</b>. It will be appreciated that thin film switches <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> provide a service life that exceed generally known trigger and safety switches and at a reduced cost.</p>
  <p num="p-0055">The molded bridge <b>48</b> further supports and orients a portion of the printed circuit <b>46</b> that forms a rotary speed transducer <b>54</b>. Two inductive pickups <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> of the printed circuit <b>46</b> are oriented to register to respectively to alternating north and south magnetic poles on a ring magnet (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) of the flywheel <b>28</b>, forming a rotary speed sensor <b>60</b>. The non-contact nature of the rotary speed sensor <b>60</b> avoids degradation due to wear. In addition, by sensing rotary speed directly, the sensor <b>60</b> provides an accurate measurement representative of the kinetic energy of the flywheel <b>28</b>. By contrast, if electrical current drawn by the motor was sensed instead, the resulting measurement may contain variations due to friction, motor component degradation, etc. More accurate speed sensing allows more accurate transfer of kinetic energy to the fastener and thus a more consistent result.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">Before discussing the control system <b>12</b> in greater, the mechanical aspects of the fastener drive assembly <b>16</b> are discussed in greater detail.</p>
  <p num="h-0008">Fastener Drive Assembly of the Flywheel Operated Hand Tool</p>
  <p num="p-0057">The fastener drive assembly <b>16</b> is described that has features of efficiently uses DC electrical power by accelerating the flywheel <b>28</b> with the DC motor <b>24</b>. A clutching technique is advantageously used that avoids the need for a manual reset. In addition, components are described below that advantageously couple to the flywheel during acceleration to increase the inertial load prior to driving the fastener and then disengage after driving the fastener. Furthermore, resetting the fastener drive assembly <b>16</b> with a vacuum return approach further conserves electrical power and avoids the generally known techniques that require a manual reset key.</p>
  <p num="p-0058"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b> illustrate top, left side, bottom and rear views of the fastener drive assembly <b>16</b> as positioned within the main body <b>14</b> of the nailing tool <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b> have electrical control module <b>18</b> removed for clarity. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the primary operational elements of fastener drive assembly <b>16</b> comprise the flywheel <b>28</b> for providing kinetic energy, for driving a fastener into a workpiece, energized by an electric motor <b>24</b>. Flywheel <b>28</b> is freewheeling upon a fixed central shaft <b>62</b>. Upon achieving the required revolutions per minute (RPM), a clutch drive assembly <b>64</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 9</figref>) causes engagement of a clutch plate <b>66</b> and flywheel <b>28</b> thereby transferring a portion of the kinetic energy of flywheel <b>28</b> to a linearly moving fastener driver <b>68</b> for driving a fastener into a workpiece. The flywheel <b>28</b> is thereafter allowed to continue spinning with any remaining kinetic energy between cycles to further conserve electrical power and to reduce cycle time.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, through <b>9</b>, the elements and operation of the fastener drive assembly <b>16</b> will be discussed. The fastener drive assembly <b>16</b> comprises clutch drive assembly <b>64</b> and flywheel <b>28</b> gear driven by electric motor <b>24</b>. Although a gear drive between motor <b>24</b> and flywheel <b>28</b> is primarily illustrated herein, it is understood that a belt drive may also be used between motor <b>24</b> and flywheel <b>28</b> or any other suitable drive mechanism. As an alternative to having the motor axis of rotation parallel to the axis of rotation of flywheel <b>28</b>, as illustrated herein, it may be preferable to position motor <b>24</b> such that its axis of rotation is perpendicular to the axis of rotation of flywheel <b>28</b> and shaft <b>62</b>, thereby employing a bevel gear drive between the motor output shaft and the flywheel periphery.</p>
  <p num="p-0060">Referring particularly to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and additionally to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 through 8</figref>, the mechanical structure of flywheel <b>28</b> and clutch drive assembly <b>64</b> will be operationally described.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">Clutch drive assembly <b>64</b> and flywheel <b>28</b> are axially aligned upon central shaft <b>62</b> as best illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Central shaft <b>62</b> is threadingly affixed to end plate <b>70</b> which in turn is rigidly attached to a frame <b>72</b> by an integral boss <b>74</b> extending axially from end plate <b>70</b> and received within a slotted groove <b>76</b> such that end plate <b>70</b> and central shaft <b>62</b> are non-rotatable. The opposite end of central shaft <b>62</b> is received within supporting groove <b>78</b> in frame <b>72</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0062">Flywheel <b>28</b> is rotatingly positioned at the end of central shaft <b>62</b>, as best illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, upon a deep groove ball bearing <b>80</b>, whereby flywheel <b>28</b> freely rotates about central shaft <b>62</b> when energized by motor <b>24</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0063">Flywheel <b>28</b> includes a conical cavity <b>82</b> for receiving therein a conical friction surface <b>84</b> of conical clutch plate <b>66</b>. Clutch plate <b>66</b> and an activation plate <b>86</b>, although they are separable members, are geared to a drum <b>88</b> by interlocking projections <b>90</b> and <b>92</b> respectively, whereby clutch plate <b>66</b>, activation plate <b>86</b> and drum <b>88</b> rotate freely about shaft <b>62</b> as a single unitary assembly. Roller bearings <b>94</b> <i>a </i>and <b>94</b> <i>b</i>, positioned on the inside diameter of drum <b>88</b>, are provided to assure the free rotational characteristic of activation plate <b>86</b>, drum <b>88</b> and clutch plate <b>66</b> as a unitary assembly.</p>
  <p num="p-0064">Adjacent activation plate <b>86</b> is a fixed plate <b>96</b>. Fixed plate <b>96</b> and activation plate <b>86</b> are connected to one another by three equally spaced axially expandable ball ramps <b>98</b> <i>a</i>, <b>98</b> <i>b</i>, <b>98</b> <i>c</i>, <b>98</b> <i>a</i>′, <b>98</b> <i>b</i>′, and <b>98</b> <i>c′ </i>as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. The operation of the ball ramps <b>98</b> between fixed plate <b>96</b> and activation plate <b>86</b> is described in greater detail below. Fixed plate <b>96</b> is fixed to frame <b>72</b> such that fixed plate <b>96</b> is free to move axially upon central shaft <b>62</b>, but not free to rotate about central shaft <b>62</b> by an anti-rotation tang <b>100</b> slidably received within an axially aligned slot <b>102</b> within frame <b>72</b>. See <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0065">Fixed plate <b>96</b> includes a circular projection <b>104</b> receiving thereon freely rotatable thrust bearing <b>106</b> positioned between fixed plate <b>96</b> and a retarder plate <b>108</b>. A pair of nested, parallel acting, Belleville springs <b>110</b> are positioned, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, between retarder plate <b>108</b> and a solenoid plate <b>112</b> the function of which is described in greater detail below. Axially expandable ball ramps <b>113</b>, see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, connect end plate <b>70</b> and solenoid plate <b>112</b>, the function of which is also described in greater detail below.</p>
  <p num="p-0066">Positioned upon central shaft <b>62</b>, between clutch plate <b>66</b> and flywheel <b>28</b>, is a compression spring assembly <b>114</b> comprising washers <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> having a coil spring <b>120</b> therebetween the function of which is described in further detail below.</p>
  <p num="p-0067">Upon start of the fastener work, or driving, cycle, the control module <b>18</b> causes motor <b>24</b> to “spin up” flywheel <b>28</b>, in the counter clockwise direction as indicated by arrow A in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, to a predetermined RPM. Upon flywheel <b>28</b> achieving its desired RPM, or kinetic energy state, the control module <b>18</b> activates solenoid <b>26</b> which, through a flexible wire solenoid cable <b>122</b> extending from a solenoid plunger <b>124</b> and affixed to the periphery of solenoid plate <b>112</b> causes solenoid plate <b>112</b> to rotate clockwise, as indicated by arrow B in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. As solenoid plate <b>112</b> rotates clockwise, solenoid plate <b>112</b> is caused to move axially away from end plate <b>70</b> by action of the corresponding ball ramps <b>98</b> in end plate <b>70</b> and solenoid plate <b>112</b>. See <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. As end plate <b>70</b> and solenoid plate <b>112</b> axially separate, the remaining elements of clutch drive assembly <b>64</b> are thereby caused to move axially toward flywheel <b>28</b> compressing coil spring <b>120</b> whereby clutch surface <b>36</b> preliminarily engages flywheel cavity <b>44</b>. Engagement of clutch plate <b>66</b> with flywheel <b>28</b> causes counter clockwise rotation of clutch plate <b>66</b>, drum <b>88</b> and activation plate <b>86</b>, as an assembly. By action of corresponding ball ramps <b>98</b>, between fixed plate <b>96</b> and activation plate <b>86</b>, see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, rotation of activation plate <b>86</b> causes axial separation of clutch plate <b>66</b> and activation plate <b>86</b>. Belleville springs <b>72</b> are thus compressed against solenoid plate <b>112</b> thereby providing an opposite axial force, forcing clutch plate <b>66</b> into tighter engagement with flywheel <b>28</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0068">As drum <b>88</b> rotates counter clockwise, cables <b>126</b> <i>a </i>and <b>126</b> <i>b </i>wrap about peripheral grooves <b>128</b> and <b>130</b> in drum <b>88</b> and clutch plate <b>66</b> respectively, thereby drawing a vacuum return piston assembly <b>132</b> downward, within a cylinder <b>134</b>, in a power, or working, stroke whereby the attached fastener driver <b>68</b> is likewise driven downward, through guide block <b>108</b> and opening <b>135</b> within frame <b>72</b>, thereby driving a selected fastener into a targeted workpiece.</p>
  <p num="p-0069"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A through 13C</figref> sequentially illustrate the action between fixed plate <b>96</b> and activation plate <b>86</b> as plate <b>86</b> rotates during the power stroke of clutch drive assembly <b>64</b>. Although ball ramps <b>98</b> of fixed plate <b>96</b> and activation plate <b>86</b> are helical as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, ramps <b>98</b> are illustrated as being linear in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A through 13C</figref> for simplicity of explanation.</p>
  <p num="p-0070"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> illustrates fixed plate <b>96</b> and activation plate <b>86</b> at the beginning of the tool's work cycle. As flywheel <b>28</b> drives activation plate <b>86</b> counter clockwise (to the left in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>) balls <b>136</b>, following the profile of ramp <b>98</b>, cause a fast and sudden separation x, between activation plate <b>86</b> and fixed plate <b>96</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>. Separation x is maintained throughout the power stroke of fastener driver <b>68</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, thereby affecting the transfer of the kinetic energy, stored within flywheel <b>28</b>, to a driver <b>68</b> as described above. At the end of the power stroke, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref>, plates <b>96</b> and <b>86</b> suddenly close together thereby causing the rapid disengagement of clutch plate <b>66</b> from flywheel <b>28</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0071"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> presents a representative graphical plot of the separation x between activation plate <b>86</b> and fixed plate <b>96</b> as a function of the angle of rotation of activation plate <b>86</b>. A combination driver guide and resilient stop block <b>138</b> is preferably positioned at the bottom of cylinder <b>134</b> to stop piston assembly <b>132</b>, within cylinder <b>134</b>, at the end of the power stroke.</p>
  <p num="p-0072">Upon disengagement of clutch plate <b>66</b> from flywheel <b>28</b>, coil spring <b>120</b> urges all elements of clutch drive assembly <b>64</b> back toward end plate <b>70</b>. The resulting axial force and pressure now being applied to solenoid plate <b>112</b>, by action of coil spring <b>120</b> and Belleville springs <b>74</b>, cause solenoid plate <b>112</b> to close upon end plate <b>70</b>. The pressure being exerted, by solenoid plate <b>112</b>, upon balls <b>140</b> cause solenoid plate <b>112</b> to rotate, counterclockwise, towards its original start position whereby solenoid cable <b>122</b>, being wrapped about solenoid plate <b>112</b>, stops the rotation of solenoid plate <b>112</b> when solenoid plunger <b>124</b> returns to its start position as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. In order to decrease the tensile stress applied to solenoid cable <b>122</b> as it stops, the counterclockwise rotation of solenoid plate <b>112</b> and retarder plate <b>108</b> is provided. By action of the axial force remaining within Belleville springs <b>72</b>, retarder plate <b>108</b> and solenoid plate <b>112</b>, as an assembly, exhibit a combined mass and/or inertia greater than that of solenoid plate <b>112</b> alone. Thus, during the short period of time during which the combined solenoid plate <b>112</b> and retarder plate <b>108</b> assembly is rotationally accelerated the rotational velocity achieved has been reduced and upon separation of retarder plate <b>108</b> from solenoid plate <b>112</b>, solenoid plate <b>112</b> has a lower angular momentum resulting in a lower tensile stress being applied to solenoid cable <b>122</b> as it stops rotation of solenoid plate <b>112</b>. Once retarder plate <b>108</b> is uncoupled from solenoid plate <b>112</b>, retarder plate <b>108</b> freely rotates about central shaft <b>62</b> until its kinetic energy dissipates. By use of retarder plate <b>108</b> the mass and/or inertia of solenoid plate <b>112</b> may be selectively chosen so as not to unnecessarily stress solenoid cable <b>122</b> upon stopping the rotation of solenoid plate <b>112</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0073">By constructing the clutch drive assembly <b>64</b>, as taught hereinabove, clutch plate <b>66</b> disengages from flywheel <b>28</b> thereby allowing flywheel <b>28</b> to continue spinning after clutch drive assembly <b>64</b> has reached the end of its power stroke. Thus in the event it is desired to successively drive additional fasteners, the remaining kinetic energy is available for the subsequent operation thereby economizing battery power and saving the drive assembly elements and/or the frame <b>72</b> from having to absorb the impact that would otherwise occur by bringing flywheel <b>28</b> to a full stop immediately after the power stroke. This feature also permits “dry firing” of the tool.</p>
  <p num="p-0074">The clutch drive system as taught herein also provides for automatic compensation for clutch wear in that the expansion between end plate <b>70</b> and solenoid plate <b>112</b> will continue until clutch plate <b>66</b> engages flywheel <b>28</b> thereby allowing solenoid plate <b>112</b> to take up the difference at the start of every power drive.</p>
  <p num="p-0075">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Vacuum return piston assembly <b>132</b> comprises piston <b>142</b> slidably received within cylinder <b>134</b>. Spaced from the top of piston <b>142</b> is a circumscribing groove <b>144</b> having positioned therein a sealing O-ring <b>146</b>. Positioned toward the bottom of piston <b>142</b> are two axial stabilizing bands <b>148</b> and <b>150</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0076">The inside diameter D, of cylinder <b>134</b>, is flared outward to diameter D′ at the top of cylinder <b>134</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Diameter D′ is slightly greater than the outside diameter of O-ring <b>146</b> thus creating an annular gap <b>152</b> between O-ring <b>146</b> and inside diameter D′.</p>
  <p num="p-0077">As piston assembly <b>132</b> is drawn axially into cylinder <b>134</b>, during the power stroke of fastener driver <b>68</b>, O-ring <b>146</b> slidingly engages the inside wall diameter D of cylinder <b>134</b> thereby forming a pneumatic seal between inside wall <b>153</b> of cylinder <b>134</b> and piston assembly <b>132</b>. As piston assembly <b>132</b> progresses into cylinder <b>134</b>, a vacuum is created within the top portion of cylinder <b>134</b>, between advancing piston assembly <b>132</b> and the sealed end cap <b>154</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0078">Upon disengagement of friction clutch plate <b>66</b> from flywheel <b>28</b>, the vacuum created within the top portion of cylinder <b>134</b> draws piston assembly <b>132</b> back toward an end cap <b>154</b> thereby resetting activation plate <b>86</b>, drum <b>88</b>, and clutch plate <b>66</b>, as an assembly, to their restart position.</p>
  <p num="p-0079">As O-ring <b>146</b> passes from inside diameter D to diameter D′, on its return stroke, any air that may have by passed O-ring <b>146</b>, during the power stroke, is compressed and permitted to flow past O-ring <b>146</b> through annular gap <b>152</b> and to the atmosphere through cylinder <b>134</b>, thereby preventing an accumulation of entrapped air above piston assembly <b>132</b>. A resilient end stop <b>156</b> is preferably positioned within end cap to absorb any impact that may occur as piston assembly <b>132</b> returns to its start position at the top of cylinder <b>134</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0080">As drum <b>88</b> returns to its start position tang <b>157</b> radially extending from drum <b>88</b> engages abutment block <b>158</b> affixed to frame <b>72</b>, see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, thereby preventing over travel of drum <b>88</b> as it returns to its start position.</p>
  <p num="p-0081">It will be appreciated that the above-described fastener drive assembly <b>16</b> is illustrative and that aspects of the invention have application in other types of fastener drive assemblies.</p>
  <p num="p-0082">Additional structural and operational details of the fastener drive assembly <b>16</b> is completely described within the two co-pending patent applications identified in the “Related Patent Applications” section above and are incorporated herein by reference.</p>

  <p num="p-0083"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> depicts a control system <b>200</b> for a nailing tool <b>10</b> that advantageously uses rotary speed sensing of a inertial member, depicted as a flywheel <b>202</b>, to more consistently and efficiently drive a fastener into a workpiece. The control system <b>200</b> responds to input signals <b>204</b> received and processed by an electronic control module <b>206</b> to command a motive device, such as a flywheel motor <b>208</b>, to accelerate the flywheel <b>202</b>. The control module <b>206</b> further commands a clutch actuator <b>210</b> to transfer kinetic energy from the flywheel <b>202</b> to a fastener.</p>
  <p num="p-0084">A signal representative of the rotational rate (e.g., RPM) that a plurality <b>212</b> of radially arrayed pairs of magnetic poles rotate with the flywheel <b>202</b> is generated by a transducer <b>214</b> that senses each closest pair of registered magnetic poles <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> of the plurality <b>212</b>. In addition to flywheel speed signal, the control system <b>200</b> responds to other types of inputs. For example, the input signals <b>204</b> may include a trigger input <b>220</b>, a safety input <b>222</b>, a user speed adjustment input <b>224</b>, a continuous flywheel mode switch input <b>226</b>, a fastener type sensor input <b>228</b>, and a fastener transducer input <b>230</b> for sensing the presence of a fastener positioned for driving.</p>
  <p num="p-0085">A fastener indexer <b>232</b> may advantageously respond to an electrical command from the control module <b>206</b>. The electric interface to a separable indexing magazine (not shown) may be readily designed and assembled with electrical interconnects. This advantageously compares to pneumatic power tools with indexing wherein more complicated pneumatic plumbing at the interface of the magazine and main body is required.</p>
  <p num="p-0086">The control module <b>206</b> may respond to an enabling condition input <b>234</b>. In some instances, the availability of electrical power in combination with actuation of a trigger or depression of a safety may be deemed an enabling condition for powering the nailing tool <b>10</b>. Alternatively or in addition, the enabling condition input <b>234</b> may represent other input signals that enable or disable the nailing tool <b>10</b>. For instance, the enabling condition input <b>234</b> may include a sensed motor overheat condition, an ON/OFF switch, a battery power voltage level, or presence of an AC electrical power input. The latter may cause the control module <b>206</b> to switch power source, or to charge a battery.</p>
  <p num="p-0087">Battery input <b>236</b> may represent a source of power for the control module <b>206</b>. In addition, the control module <b>206</b> may respond to the voltage level of the battery input <b>236</b> by altering time-out values when the control module expects to see acceleration and actuation performed. For example, for a given battery voltage level, the flywheel motor <b>208</b> should accelerate to a given target speed in a certain time range, whereas this time range would be expected to change in relation to the voltage level. Thus, mechanical failures would be more accurately detected by more accurately predicting the performance thereof.</p>
  <p num="p-0088">The electronic control module <b>206</b> includes interfaces <b>240</b>–<b>256</b> for these input signals <b>204</b>. A speed sensor <b>240</b> may convert the speed signal from the transducer <b>214</b> into another form. For instance, the speed sensor may convert an analog signal into a near DC signal (digital signal) suitable for digital signal processing. A thin film switch “A” <b>242</b> converts a mechanical trigger input <b>220</b> into an electrical trigger signal. A thin film switch “B” <b>244</b> converts a mechanical safety input <b>222</b> into an electrical safety signal. A preset speed range interface <b>246</b> may fully comprise a speed selection or define a flywheel speed range for user speed adjustment input <b>224</b>. The present speed range interface <b>246</b> may define a range constrained by a combination of the operable range of the flywheel motor <b>208</b> and/or clutch actuator <b>210</b> and the force requirements expected for the fastener and type of workpiece. A continuous mode input <b>248</b> receives a selection for continuous or intermittent mode for the flywheel. It should be appreciated that continuous mode or intermittent mode may be used at the exclusion of the other mode. Alternatively or in addition, the selection may be determined based on another consideration such as state of charge of the battery (e.g., switching to intermittent mode to save electrical power when a battery is partially discharged). A fastener type input interface <b>250</b> senses or accepts a selection from the fastener type sensor input <b>228</b>, which may advantageously adjust speed and timing considerations. A fastener sensor interface <b>252</b> responds the fastener transducer input <b>230</b> to convert the signal into a form suitable for digital processing. The control module <b>206</b> may respond to the presence or absence of a fastener ready for driving in a number of fashions. For example, dry firing may be prevented to avoid wear or a jam of a partially loaded or improper fastener; an indication of the need to load the magazine may be given, a continuous mode for the flywheel may be discontinued, etc. For applications with an indexing magazine, an index control interface <b>254</b> provides an index signal suitable for the fastener indexer <b>232</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0089">The control module <b>206</b> is depicted as including a power supply <b>256</b> that responds to the enabling condition input <b>234</b> and the battery input <b>236</b>. It should be appreciated that the power supply may comprise a power source for the control module <b>206</b> only, wherein power drain on the battery is prevented by shutting down the control module <b>206</b> except when commanded to drive a fastener or when in continuous mode and the tool <b>10</b> is enabled. The power supply <b>256</b> may further represent logic to select a source of electrical power and/or to charge an attached battery. In addition, the power supply <b>256</b> may represent additional safety features to prevent electrical power from inadvertently reaching actuating components.</p>
  <p num="p-0090">The electronic control module <b>206</b> provides a motor control interface <b>260</b> to convert a control signal into a form suitable for the flywheel motor <b>208</b> (e.g., a logic signal to a pulse width modulated (PWM) power signal). A clutch control interface <b>262</b> converts a control signal into a form suitable for the clutch actuator <b>210</b> (e.g., a logic signal to power signal).</p>
  <p num="p-0091">The control system <b>200</b> may advantageously include additional features to the user to include an aim indicator <b>264</b> that is controlled by an indicator control interface <b>266</b> in the control module <b>206</b>. For example, in response to an enabling condition such as depression of the safety against a workpiece, a focused light or laser pointer may be directed at the expect point of the fastener. The illumination thereof may assist the user in seeing the workpiece more clearly in dim lighting or to better appreciate the aim of the tool.</p>
  <p num="p-0092">The electronic control module <b>206</b> advantageously includes a digital controller <b>300</b> that is programmed for additional features. To that end, a processor <b>302</b> accesses instructions and data by indirect addressing through a pointer <b>304</b> of a Random Access Memory <b>306</b>. The processor and/or memory access analog-to-digital (A/D) inputs <b>308</b>, such as from the speed sensor <b>240</b>, that are used and stored in digital form. Although not depicted, another example may be the speed adjustment input <b>224</b> and preset speed range interface <b>246</b> as being analog inputs. The memory <b>306</b> includes instructions <b>310</b>; a switch timer <b>312</b> for monitoring a stuck or inadvertently held switch; interrupts code <b>314</b> for handling time sensitive signals or abnormal processing; a motor timer <b>316</b> for monitoring overlong motor operation that could result in overheating; a switch debounce buffer <b>318</b> for precluding inadvertent or spurious switch signals from being acted upon; a speed target register <b>320</b> for holding a preset or calculated value for a desired or appropriate flywheel speed; an actuation timer register <b>322</b> for holding a preset or calculated value for monitoring for abnormally long time for transfer kinetic energy to the driver by actuation; a no-operation (no op) timer <b>324</b> for timing when to deactivate; or other data structures or unused memory <b>326</b> </p>
  <p num="p-0093">It will be appreciated that the instructions <b>310</b> include diagnostic code to perform RAM checking, verifying that all memory locations are working properly prior to use and that the program counter <b>304</b> is indexing correctly. The diagnostic code further checks that jumps and returns from subroutine locations return back to the correct location. In addition, the diagnostic code checks that when the processor <b>302</b> tells a pin to go high or low that the line attached to the pin responds accordingly.</p>
  <p num="p-0094">The control module <b>206</b> includes a watch dog timer circuit <b>330</b> that prevents a processing failure. Throughout processing, it will be appreciated that the watch dog timer circuit <b>330</b> is periodically reset by the processor <b>302</b>, lest a time limit be reached that initiates resetting or disabling the control module <b>206</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0095">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, an illustrative sequence of steps for utilizing the control system <b>200</b> to affect control of the tool <b>10</b> is depicted as a main routine <b>400</b>. Before driving a fastener, user settings are available (block <b>402</b>). For instance, a user setting may include an enabling condition such as an ON setting or a momentary actuation of a control (e.g., trigger, safety). A user setting may include a MODE setting, such as continuous, intermittent, or automatic (e.g., the control system determines the appropriate mode). The user setting may include a speed adjust setting, to include a factory preset range appropriate for the fastener drive assembly, a range appropriate for the type of fastener sensed, or a user selected range.</p>
  <p num="p-0096">In the illustrative embodiment, a user input, such as depression of the safety switch, begins processing (block <b>404</b>) by enabling the control system (block <b>406</b>). Immediately, the control module performs diagnostics to preclude failures that may cause an inadvertent activation and actuation of the tool (block <b>408</b>), discussed in more detail below. It will be appreciated that certain diagnostic features continue to be performed throughout operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0097">Once diagnostics are complete, with a determination is made as to whether the safety is depressed (block <b>410</b>). If so, an aim indicator is activated (block <b>412</b>). This feature is included to illustrate features that may be performed to give visual indications to the user about the operation or condition of the tool.</p>
  <p num="p-0098">Thereafter, a determination is made as to whether the tool is in continuous mode (block <b>414</b>). This determination may be preset, user selected, or automatically selected based on considerations such as battery voltage. If in continuous mode in block <b>414</b>, then a further determination is made as to whether an input has been made to ready the tool for actuation, for instance a depression of the trigger (block <b>416</b>). And if so, the continuous mode is initiated as described below. Otherwise, an additional determination is made as to whether a no op timer has expired (block <b>418</b>). If no operations have been received within a suitable time, then the control module is disabled (block <b>420</b>) to prevent battery drain and preclude inadvertent actuation. If in block <b>418</b> the no op time-out has not occurred, then processing continues to wait for a trigger command to initiate the continuous operating of the flywheel.</p>
  <p num="p-0099">Returning to block <b>414</b>, if continuous mode is not selected or appropriate, then the main routine <b>400</b> is in an intermittent mode that advantageously accelerates the flywheel to a target speed each time a fastener is to be driven. Thus, battery power is conserved between driving cycles. Since residual kinetic energy of the flywheel is conserved by the fastener drive assembly, the cycle time is still short even in intermittent mode. In intermittent mode, a determination is made as to whether a valid command to drive a fastener has been received (block <b>422</b>), and if so, initiating intermittent acceleration of the flywheel will be discussed below, as well as the forced sequence of the safety and the trigger for a valid command. If a valid command is not received in block <b>422</b>, then a further determination is made as to whether a no op time-out limit has been reached (block <b>424</b>), and if so the control module is disabled (block <b>420</b>) and routine <b>400</b> is complete.</p>
  <p num="p-0100"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> depicts the diagnostics routine <b>500</b> referenced in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. Certain diagnostic tests are performed upon powering up the control module and other tests continue in background during operation of the tool. For example, a watchdog timer (block <b>502</b>) is depicted, wherein a dedicated circuit times the period since the last update from the processor. If the watchdog timer is not updated before timing out, the control module is assumed to be processing abnormally and the tool is placed in a safety lockout mode (block <b>503</b>). This watchdog timer continues operation throughout the main routine <b>400</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0101">Also, digital parameters are initialized and any calibrations are performed (block <b>504</b>). For example, interrupt vectors are set so that any resets will be appropriately handled. Also, analog devices like oscillators are calibrated. Then the processor memory is tested by checking for any failure to toggle and to read a memory location (Z BIT) (block <b>505</b>). If Z BIT fails (block <b>506</b>), then safety lock-out mode is set (block <b>503</b>), else any unused memory is loaded with a reset code (e.g., interrupt vector) (block <b>508</b>). In addition, a check is made as to whether the program counter (pointer) is corrupt (block <b>510</b>), and if so safety lockout mode is set (block <b>512</b>). If the program is not corrupt in block <b>510</b>, then a delay occurs to allow for the power supply to the control module to stabilize (block <b>514</b>). If not stable (block <b>516</b>), then safety lockout mode is set (block <b>518</b>). If stable in block <b>516</b>, then the trigger time-out counter is set up so that overly long trigger commands due not result in actuation (block <b>520</b>). Also, switch debounce code is set up so that momentary or spurious trigger or switch signals are ignored (block <b>522</b>). Thereafter, routine <b>500</b> returns to the main routine <b>400</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0102"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> depicts the intermittent mode from block <b>416</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. In particular, this portion of the main routine <b>400</b> begins with a valid command from the user indicating that the flywheel is to be accelerated to the target speed and the driver is to be driven by the flywheel. To that end, the speed target is determined (block <b>600</b>), which could be based on a preset value, a user selection, a preset speed range adjusted by a user selection, a selection based on a sensed fastener type, or a range based on a sensed fastener type as adjusted by a user selection. With the target set, a motor command is initiated (block <b>602</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0103">Advantageously, the motor command begins with a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) soft start is used. Thus, the duty cycle of the PWM command ramps up to a full command level, reducing the initial electrical current demand on the battery and surge to the motor. Thereby, power consumption is greatly reduced and the service life of the motor is extended.</p>
  <p num="p-0104">With the flywheel accelerating in response to the motor command, a determination is made as to whether the safety is still held (block <b>604</b>). Withdrawal of the safety from the workpiece causes the motor command to be deactivated (block <b>606</b>) and the control module to be disabled (block <b>608</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0105">If the command is still valid in block <b>604</b>, then a further determination is made as to whether the motor time-out has expired (block <b>610</b>). If so, due to a failure in the fastener drive assembly (e.g., stuck clutch, motor failure, weak battery), the safety lockout mode is set (block <b>612</b>). If the motor has not timed out in block <b>610</b>, then the current sensed speed is compared to the target. If the target is not reached (block <b>614</b>), then processing returns to block <b>602</b>, continuing with a full motor command. If the target speed is reached in block <b>614</b>, then the motor command is deactivated (block <b>616</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0106">A speed reduction threshold is determined for imparting or transferring kinetic energy from the flywheel to the linearly moving fastener driver. Thus, not only is a known amount of kinetic energy available in the flywheel, but a known amount is transferred to the driver and thus to the fastener for a consistent depth of drive. Moreover, since the flywheel is not completely stopped during or after transferring the kinetic energy, the remaining kinetic energy is available for a subsequent operation. The speed reduction may be based on a look-up table for the given conditions, based on a fixed ratio of a current speed, or a fixed scalar amount below the target, or other measures.</p>
  <p num="p-0107">The clutch is engaged to transfer the kinetic energy to the driver (block <b>620</b>). Then a determination is made as to whether the threshold is reached (block <b>622</b>). If not reached, then a further determination is made as to whether the actuation time-out has been reached (block <b>624</b>), and if so, safety lock-out mode is set (block <b>626</b>). If in block <b>622</b> the time-out is not reached, then actuation is still in progress by returning to block <b>620</b>. Returning to block <b>622</b>, if the reduction threshold is reached, then the clutch is deactivated (block <b>628</b>). If installed and enabled, the fastener index is actuated (block <b>630</b>). Then the control module is disabled (block <b>632</b>) and main routine <b>400</b> ends.</p>
  <p num="p-0108"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> depicts the continuous mode portion after a trigger command in block <b>416</b> of the main routine <b>400</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. In particular, the speed target is determined (block <b>700</b>) and the motor is started (block <b>702</b>) in a manner similar to that described respectively for blocks <b>600</b> and <b>602</b>. Then a determination is made as to whether the motor time-out has expired, indicating an inability to accelerate the motor in the expected time (block <b>704</b>). If expired, then safety lockout mode is set (block <b>706</b>). If not timed out, then a further determination is made as to whether the target has been reached (block <b>708</b>). If not, then flywheel acceleration continues by returning to block <b>702</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0109">Advantageously, continuous mode allows addition safety/trigger sequences for a valid command. For instance, rather than requiring the safety signal to precede the trigger signal, (“trigger fire”), the trigger signal may precede the safety signal (“bottom fire”). Again, a trigger time-out (e.g., 3 seconds) is applicable just as is the safety time-out (e.g., 3 seconds) to minimize inadvertent actuation. Bottom fire is included as an option in continuous mode for applications wherein the user desires very short cycle time between drives or has a personal preference for this technique.</p>
  <p num="p-0110">If the target is reached in block <b>708</b>, then the speed is held (block <b>710</b>). For example an operating range may be entered wherein the motor command is recommenced when a lower limit is reached and removed when an upper limit is reached. Then, a determination is made as to whether a valid command has been received from the user (block <b>712</b>). If not, a check is made as to whether the no op time-out has occurred (block <b>714</b>), and if not, the flywheel speed is continuously maintained by returning to block <b>710</b>. If the no-op timer has expired in block <b>714</b>, then the motor command is deactivated (<b>716</b>) and the control module is disabled (block <b>718</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0111">Returning to block <b>712</b> wherein a valid command has been received, then the clutch is actuated in a manner similar to that described above for the intermittent mode, wherein blocks <b>720</b>–<b>734</b> correspond respectively to block <b>616</b>–<b>630</b>. However, after deactuating the clutch in block <b>732</b> and actuating a fastener index in block <b>634</b>, control returns to block <b>710</b> to continue holding speed in a continuous fashion awaiting the next valid command to drive a fastener.</p>
  <p num="p-0112"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref> graphically illustrates a valid user command that initiates acceleration of the motor <b>24</b> and actuation of the solenoid <b>26</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> over a time period of “t<b>0</b>” to “t<b>7</b>”. At time “t<b>1</b>”, an enabling event, depicted as depression of the safety, provides power to the control system. The “Power or Safety” remains on throughout the depicted time scale to time “t<b>7</b>”. At time “t<b>2</b>”, trigger signal is received, which also remains present throughout the remainder the graph, representing the tool placed against the workpiece followed by depression of the trigger. Also at time “t2”, the motor command (“Motor Signal”) begins.</p>
  <p num="p-0113">The portion of the motor signal between times “t<b>2</b>” and “t<b>3</b>” of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref> are depicted in greater detail in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref>, which shows the soft start portion of the motor signal. In particular, the PWM motor signal begins with an on time of 2 μsec and off time of 510 μsec, incrementing each cycle by 10 μsec until reaching a full command of 510 μsec on time and 10μ off time. It will be appreciated that other approaches to soft starting the motor may be implemented as well as omitting soft start.</p>
  <p num="p-0114">Returning to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref>, with the motor signal beginning at time “t<b>2</b>”, the parameter of rotational speed of the flywheel and motor is sensed (“motor speed”). The initial value of motor speed at time “t<b>2</b>” may be nonzero if the flywheel has residual kinetic energy from a previous driving cycle. At about time “t<b>3</b>”, the sensed speed enters the lowest speed of the speed range available for actuation. At time “t<b>5</b>”, the sensed speed reaches the target speed, whereupon several changes occur. The motor command is deactivated. In addition, a solenoid signal commands actuation, transferring the kinetic energy from the flywheel to the linearly moving driver to the fastener as shown by the decreasing motor speed. At time “t6”, the motor speed is sensed at having reduced to a threshold indicating the desired actuation, and thus the solenoid signal is deactivated.</p>
  <p num="p-0115"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23C–23F</figref> depict instances where an invalid command is given, resulting in no actuation of the tool. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23C</figref> presents a trigger signal at time “t<b>1</b>” that precedes the safety signal at time “t<b>2</b>”, which in the illustrative embodiment precludes activating the motor and actuating the solenoid. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23D</figref> presents a safety depressed at time “t<b>1</b>”, but the safety signal reaches a time-out at time “t<b>4</b>” before the trigger signal is received, thus precluding activation and actuation. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23E</figref> presents a safety signal at time “t<b>1</b>” and a trigger signal at time “t<b>2</b>”, which is the required sequence and within the time-out value for the safety. Although the safety signal remains present, the trigger signal is withdrawn after time “t<b>4</b>” before the motor speed has reached the speed target (“speed set point”). Without a valid command being removed, the motor signal is removed and actuation does not occur. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23F</figref> presents a situation similar to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23E</figref> except that the safety signal is the one that is removed after time “t<b>4</b>” before the motor speed reaches the speed target. Again, the motor signal is removed and actuation does not occur.</p>
  <p num="p-0116"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A–24B</figref> illustrate the adaptability of the control system to a wide operating range of fastener types and battery charge. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref> graphically illustrates a scenario where the flywheel accelerates rapidly with a fully charged battery and a low speed set point for the speed target. Thus at time “t<b>1</b>” the low speed set point is reached and the solenoid signal is present for a relatively short period until time “t<b>2</b>”. Then, between time “t<b>4</b>” and “t<b>5</b>”, the battery voltage is shown as reaching a fully discharged level and the tool having been set to a high-speed set point. Thus, the acceleration of the motor speed from time “t<b>5</b>” to time “t<b>6</b>” to the high-speed set point takes longer. Moreover, the solenoid signal is required to be present for a longer period from time “t<b>6</b>” to “t<b>7</b>” by actuating more slowly with a lower solenoid signal.</p>
  <p num="p-0117"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref> illustrates a feature of the control system to accommodate increased tolerance within the clutch components due to wear or manufacturing variation yet still detect a failure condition. In the first trace representing a clutch with a low gap, the motor accelerates the flywheel to the target speed at time “t<b>1</b>”. Then, a brief solenoid signal starts at time “t<b>1</b>”. After a brief period, the flywheel has slowed to the necessary speed drop off and the solenoid signal is deactivated, having provided the necessary amount of kinetic energy to the driver. In the second trace representing a clutch with a high gap, the motor accelerates the flywheel to the target speed at time “t<b>6</b>”, prompting the solenoid signal to start. The solenoid signal last for a longer period than the first trace. At time “t<b>7</b>”, the necessary speed drop off is reached and the solenoid signal is deactivated. The third trace represents a clutch that fails to engage. At time “t<b>10</b>”, the motor has accelerated the flywheel to the target speed and the solenoid signal starts. With the clutch failing to engage, the motor speed drops off slowly, still higher than the expected value at time “t<b>11</b>”. Then, at time “t<b>12</b>”, the clutch time-out value is reached, indicating the failure, and the solenoid signal is discontinued.</p>
  <p num="p-0118"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> depicts an exemplary control circuit <b>800</b> for a flywheel operated hand tool, such as the nailing tool <b>10</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> that advantageously provides selectable continuous or intermittent modes and economical speed sensing.</p>
  <p num="p-0119">A speed sensor <b>802</b> is picks up alternating north and south magnetic fields <b>804</b> on a ring magnet with an inductive transducer <b>806</b>. In particular, a series pair of coils <b>808</b> have their shared node is grounded and their opposite ends connected to a differential amplifier, or comparator U<b>1</b>, such as model no. TA75S393F. Thus, as each pair of fields <b>804</b> of the 32 alternating poles are encountered, the push-pull arrangement or differential arrangement enhances signal integrity and noise immunity of the differential speed signal of about 10–15 mV. The comparator U<b>1</b> is biased between power supply VDD and ground. The positive bias is also coupled to ground via capacitor C<b>1</b> suppress high frequency noisy disturbances from the power supply.</p>
  <p num="p-0120">The output node of the comparator U<b>1</b> is coupled to ground via a capacitor C<b>2</b> to rectify and low pass filter the differential speed output that is passed to the +T input of a monostable multivibrator (one shot) U<b>2</b>, such as model no. MM74HC4538 by Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation. The one shot U<b>2</b> is an integrated circuit that, when triggered, produces an output pulse width that is independent of the input pulse width, and can be programmed by an external resistor-capacitor (RC) network to set the pulse width. To that end, the RC input of the one shot U<b>2</b> is coupled to the common node of a series resistor R<b>1</b> and capacitor C<b>3</b>, the series coupled between power supply VDD and ground, respectively. The inverted input CS of the one shot U<b>2</b> is coupled to the common node of a series resistor R<b>2</b> and capacitor C<b>4</b>, the series coupled between power VDD and ground, respectively. The inverted output {overscore (Q)} of the one shot U<b>2</b> is connected to the inverted input −T. The bias V+ of the one shot U<b>2</b> is coupled to power supply VDD and to ground via capacitor C<b>5</b>. Thus configured, the one shot U<b>2</b> outputs at noninverted output Q a series of pulses, the spacing between pulses being a function of the rate that the poles of ring magnet pass by the speed transducer <b>808</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0121">The pulse train at output Q of one shot U<b>2</b> is connected to a node <b>810</b> via a resistor R<b>3</b>. The node <b>810</b> is also coupled to ground via capacitor C<b>6</b>. Thus, the signal at node <b>810</b> is low pass filtered, creating a near DC signal whose amplitude is related to rate of pulses. Thus, the sensed speed signal has been converted to a form suitable for digital processing.</p>
  <p num="p-0122">A controller U<b>3</b>, such as an 8-pin RISC microprocessor performs the digital processing, model PIC12C671. The analog input GP<b>1</b> of the controller U<b>3</b> receives the near DC signal from node <b>810</b>. This near DC signal is compared to a speed target reference signal at analog input GP<b>0</b>. The controller U<b>3</b> changes the analog reference signal into a digital signal to be compared to the digitized speed signal with a resolution of one bit. The speed target reference signal is produced by preset speed adjust range formed by a voltage divider of trimmable resistors R<b>4</b> and R<b>5</b> coupled between power supply VDD and ground. Inserting an infinitely variable potentiometer <b>812</b> between resistors R<b>4</b> and R<b>5</b> advantageously provides a user speed adjustment. The pick off point of the potentiometer <b>812</b> is coupled to the analog input GP<b>0</b> and also coupled to ground via capacitor C<b>7</b> for noise suppression. It will be appreciated that the resistors R<b>4</b> and R<b>5</b> may be selected for a desired speed range within which the potentiometer <b>812</b> selects a target speed. The voltage thus produced at analog input GP<b>0</b> may advantageously be selected for a desired voltage level corresponding to a target speed. When enabled by a safety signal at input GP<b>2</b>, the processor U<b>3</b> awaits a trigger signal at input GP<b>3</b>, as described above in the timing diagrams of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A–23F</figref> before producing a motor signal at output GP<b>5</b> and thereafter a solenoid actuation signal at output GP<b>4</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0123">The user initiates these actions by selecting a mode, either continuous or intermittent, at mode select switch <b>814</b>, enabling the tool with safety switch <b>816</b>, and then commanding the driving of a fastener with a trigger switch <b>818</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0124">The safety signal is received in either continuous or intermediate mode, which affects the manner of operation of processor U<b>3</b>. Specifically, in continuous mode, switch <b>814</b> couples battery voltage VBATT to a resistor R<b>6</b> whose value is selected to scale the battery voltage to the desired voltage VDD for the control system <b>800</b>. The resulting power supply voltage VDD is further regulated by being coupled to ground via the parallel combination of a capacitor C<b>8</b> and zener diode Z<b>1</b>. Thus, in continuous mode, the control system remains enabled, awaiting a safety and trigger signal to initiate the tool.</p>
  <p num="p-0125">To that end, the mode switch <b>814</b> in continuous mode also couples the battery voltage to a first input of an AND gate <b>820</b>, such as an SN74AHC1G08. The other input to the AND gate <b>820</b> receives battery voltage VBATT when the safety switch <b>816</b> is closed, inverted by inverter <b>822</b>, such as an SN74AHC1G04. The output of the AND gate <b>820</b> controls the input GP<b>2</b> via a biasing circuit <b>824</b>. In particular, the output of the AND gate <b>820</b> is connected to input GP<b>2</b> via resistor R<b>7</b>. The input GP<b>2</b> is also coupled to power supply VDD via a resistor R<b>8</b> and to ground via capacitor C<b>9</b>. When the trigger switch is closed, ground is coupled the input GP<b>3</b> of the processor U<b>3</b> via resistor R<b>9</b>. The input GP<b>3</b> is connected to power supply VDD via resistor R<b>10</b> and to ground via a capacitor C<b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0126">When the mode switch <b>812</b> is in intermittent mode, the resistor R<b>6</b> is connected to battery voltage VBATT when the safety switch <b>816</b> is closed. Also, the first input of the AND gate <b>820</b> is connected to ground.</p>
  <p num="p-0127">The processor U<b>3</b> commands a DC motor <b>826</b> with a motor signal at output GP<b>4</b> that is coupled via resistor R<b>11</b> to the base of a buffer, depicted as a small signal transistor Q<b>1</b> such as a 2N4401. The base is also coupled to ground via resistor R<b>12</b> to ensure that the transistor will be off if voltage is not applied to the base. The collector is connected to power supply VDD. The emitter is also connected to the base of a rectifier Q<b>2</b>, such as an IRL3803 that advantageously has a low RDS (on) characteristics minimizing energy dissipation, that is heat shielded. The emitter is also coupled to ground via resistor R<b>13</b> to ensure that rectifier Q<b>2</b> if off when not supplied with a signal. The turned-on rectifier Q<b>2</b> thereby couples to ground a negative terminal respectively of a DC motor <b>826</b>, a MOSFET configured as a diode Q<b>3</b> (such as a model MTD20N03HDL) that advantageously has a high current carrying capacity in a small package. A positive terminal respectively of the diode Q<b>3</b> and the DC motor <b>826</b> are coupled to battery voltage VBATT. Thus, the DC motor <b>826</b> is activated when rectifier Q<b>2</b> closes.</p>
  <p num="p-0128">The processor U<b>3</b> commands a solenoid <b>828</b> with a solenoid signal at output GP<b>5</b> that is coupled via resistor R<b>14</b> to the base of a MOSFET configured as diode Q<b>4</b> (such as a model MTD20N03HDL). The base is also coupled to ground via resistor R<b>15</b> to ensure that the transistor will be off if voltage is not applied to the base. The rectifier Q<b>4</b> has a negative terminal coupled to ground and a positive terminal coupled to a negative terminal of the solenoid <b>828</b>. The positive terminal of the solenoid <b>828</b> is coupled to battery voltage VBATT, thus solenoid <b>828</b> activates when rectifier Q<b>4</b> is closed by the solenoid signal. The rectifier Q<b>4</b> advantageously withstands the electrical current spikes associated with inductive loads of solenoids.</p>
  <p num="p-0129"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> presents an index circuit <b>830</b> for providing an electrical index signal, thereby avoiding the additional complexity of pneumatic index approaches. Moreover, the index circuit advantageously uses a one shot U<b>4</b> that is part of the same package as one shot U<b>2</b>. The index circuit <b>830</b> is triggered by the solenoid signal from GP<b>4</b> of the processor U<b>3</b> to an inverted −T input, as would be appropriate for a solenoid that is triggered on a falling edge of a solenoid signal rather than a rising edge. The one shot U<b>4</b> is configured with a positive bias V+ to power supply VDD and also coupled to ground via capacitor C<b>10</b>. A negative bias V− is grounded. A noninverted output Q is connected to input +T to place the device into a non-retriggerable, monostable mode of operation. An inverted input R is coupled to a shared node of a series combination of a resistor R<b>18</b> and capacitor C<b>11</b> that are connected across power supply VDD and ground, providing a reset RC network to hold the device in reset until power supply VDD is up and stable. Similarly, an input RC of the one shot U<b>4</b> sets up the output timing, i.e. time the output pulse is high. In particular, the input RC is coupled to a shared node of a series combination of a resistor R<b>19</b> and capacitor C<b>12</b> connected between power supply VDD and ground, respectively. The one shot U<b>4</b> has an output pulse of appropriate duration and delay from the solenoid signal to advance the next fastener after the previous fastener is driven. The index pulse from output Q is given an appropriate voltage by passing through a series resistor R<b>16</b> to a base of a rectifier Q<b>5</b> (a MOSFET configured as a diode such as a model MTD20N03HDL. The base is also coupled to ground through a resistor R<b>17</b> to ensure that rectifier Q<b>5</b> is off when no voltage is applied. A negative terminal of the rectifier Q<b>5</b> is grounded. A positive terminal rectifier Q<b>5</b> is connected to a negative terminal of an indexing solenoid <b>832</b>. A positive terminal of the indexing solenoid <b>832</b> is connected to battery voltage VBATT. Thus, when the indexing signal closes the rectifier Q<b>5</b>, the indexing solenoid <b>832</b> is activated.</p>
  <p num="p-0130">In use, a user loads the magazine <b>42</b> of the nailing tool <b>10</b> with a strip of fasteners, and installs a charged battery <b>22</b>. The tool is in a mode, such as Intermittent, conserving battery power by accelerating a flywheel each time that a fastener is to be dispensed or driven. As the nose assembly <b>36</b> is placed against a workpiece, closing a safety device <b>34</b>, the safety mechanical linkage <b>38</b> contacts a highly reliable thin film safety switch <b>52</b>, powering the control module <b>18</b>. A trigger <b>30</b> is depressed, activating another highly reliable thin film trigger switch <b>50</b> via a trigger mechanical linkage <b>32</b>. If the safety and trigger switches are actuated within appropriate time intervals and sequence (e.g., safety depressed and held no more than 3 seconds prior to trigger), then the processor U<b>3</b> calculates a target speed for the flywheel set as appropriate for the fastener drive assembly <b>16</b> and/or an appropriate setting for the fastener and workpiece. As the flywheel accelerates, the speed signal from a noncontact speed sensor <b>60</b> is compared to the target speed. Once reached, the motor <b>24</b> is de-energized and then a solenoid actuation signal couples a clutch to the flywheel <b>28</b> to impart kinetic energy to a linearly moving fastener driver <b>68</b>. The processor U<b>3</b> uses a reduction threshold to determine when the flywheel <b>28</b> has imparted an appropriate amount of kinetic energy, thereafter allowing the flywheel <b>28</b> to continue spinning with any remaining energy available for the next cycle. By monitoring flywheel speed, fault conditions are detected such as a slow motor acceleration that could be due to low battery voltage, motor degradation or a stuck clutch. Similarly, by detecting an actuation time-out, the failure of the clutch drive assembly <b>64</b> to engage is detected, preventing jamming of the tool <b>10</b> if attempting to cycle again.</p>
  <p num="p-0131">By virtue of the foregoing, a portable tool <b>10</b> provides a consistent drive in a single stroke, yet efficiently uses electrical power from the battery <b>22</b> without detrimental surges by using a DC motor <b>24</b> to accelerate a flywheel <b>28</b>. Moreover, consistent drives are ensured across a range of battery voltages and component tolerance variations (e.g., clutch wear). The consistent rotary sensing and control of a rotary member (e.g., flywheel <b>28</b>) has application more broadly to hand tools in accurately and robustly setting a desired speed.</p>
  <p num="p-0132">While the present invention has been illustrated by description of several embodiments and while the illustrative embodiments have been described in considerable detail, it is not the intention of the applicant to restrict or in any way limit the scope of the appended claims to such detail. Additional advantages and modifications may readily appear to those skilled in the art. For example, aspects of the invention are applicable to other sources of power, such as corded power tools or pneumatic power tools. As another example, although a programmed approach is described herein, it will be appreciated that digital logic or analog controls may be used.</p>
  <p num="p-0133">As a further example, although a noncontact speed sensor is disclosed, applications of the present invention may include other types of speed sensing. For instance, an optical encoding approach may be used, weigan sensor, variable reluctance sensors, Hall effect sensors, feedback from the motor such as a tachometer signal, and other techniques.</p>
  <p num="p-0134">As yet a further example, the described control circuit <b>800</b> employs a battery voltage VBATT having a nominal value with resistors and a zener diode Z<b>1</b> being used to step down the battery voltage to the power supply voltage VDD. However, it will be appreciated that a power supply (e.g., a switching power supply) capable of regulating the voltage to the integrated circuit components may be used while providing a battery voltage signal to a processor. Thereby the processor may adapt its command, timing, and other features to accommodate a wider range of battery voltage, thus extending service life. For instance, a processor having additional available inputs such as an 18-pin processor, model PIC16C71 may be used.</p>
  <p num="p-0135">As an addition example, a speed adjustment circuit may employ other types of voltage references, such as a sized digital resistor. In addition, the processor may calculate or lookup in a table a digital reference against which the sensed speed signal is compared.</p>
  <p num="p-0136">As another example, although a specific safety and trigger sequence is described, other sequences and time-out schemes may be employed. Moreover, even a single trigger scheme without a safety may be employed.</p>
