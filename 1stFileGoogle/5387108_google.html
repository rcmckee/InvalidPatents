    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading> <p>During the last several years, electronic circuits have been constructed incorporating a single, fixed audible pre-recorded message thereon, which is delivered to the user when activated. Typically, these fixed messages comprise sounds or tones which emulate a particular well-known song or provide verbal information for communicating one specific message to all users. Due to inherent limitations found in the construction of these circuits, these prior art circuits have been limited to use in greeting cards or prize/promotional gifts or games. In general, no attempt has been made to expand the use of these prerecorded message delivery circuits beyond these limited, few accepted products.</p>
    <p>The principal drawbacks of these prior art message delivery circuits is their limited message presentation abilities and the difficulties encountered in integrating the circuit in existing products. As a result, universal applicability or acceptability of these circuits has not been realized.</p>
    <p>One principal reason for the failure of these prior art systems to be more widely used has been the requirement that these prior art systems be fixedly mounted in the greeting card or prize package. As a result, only one-time use is attainable.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, these prior art systems are unable to provide a wide variety of different audible messages, as well as being extremely expensive for imparting a particular message into the electronic circuit. As a result, large quantities of the same message must be usable, in order to justify the production costs.</p>
    <p>Therefore, it is a principal object of the present invention to provide a multi-purpose, reusable, audible message delivery systems which is constructed for being universally employable either independently or in a wide variety of products and applications.</p>
    <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a multi-purpose, universally applicable, audible message delivery system having the characteristic features described above which enables users to receive a pre-recorded message while also being able to re-record a new message for subsequent delivery, whenever desired.</p>
    <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a multi-purpose, universally applicable, audible message delivery system having the characteristic features described above which is capable of being easily used by any individual for activation, to receive the recorded message, as well as easily employed for imparting a new message thereto.</p>
    <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a multi-purpose, universally applicable, audible message delivery system having the characteristic features described above which is capable of being manually transferred into a plurality of different products for enabling these products to provide audible messages where such messages have previously been impossible to achieve.</p>
    <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a multi-purpose, universally applicable, audible message delivery system having the characteristic features described above which is completely self-contained and able to be used and enjoyed as a separate, independent product.</p>
    <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a multi-purpose, universally applicable, audible message delivery system having the characteristic features described above which is reusable either independently or in any desired associated product.</p>
    <p>Other and more specific objects will in part be obvious and will in part appear hereinafter.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading> <p>In FIGS. 1 and 2, one preferred embodiment of multi-purpose universally employable, re-recordable, audible message delivery system 20 of the present invention is depicted in detail. In this embodiment, audible message delivery system 20 incorporates a housing 21, which peripherally surrounds and encloses message delivering circuitry 22. As depicted, message delivery system 20 comprises an independent, separately employable construction that can be used in a variety of alternate applications.</p>
    <p>In the preferred embodiment, message delivery circuit 22 comprises a printed board 24 on which an integrated circuit chip 25, power means 26, and a microphone 27 are all electronically interconnected. In addition, a speaker 28 is connected to contact terminals formed on printed circuit board 24 in order to provide the desired audio output for message delivery circuit 22, when appropriately activated.</p>
    <p>If desired, printed circuit board 24 of message delivery circuit 22 also comprises an LED 29 mounted to connection points on printed circuit board 24. LED 29 is constructed to be illuminated whenever the play mode and/or the record mode is activated.</p>
    <p>In the preferred embodiment, power means 26 comprises a plurality of batteries which are interconnected and mounted in holders affixed to printed board 24 to provide the desired power thereto. Of course, any alternate power source can be employed, without departing from the scope of this invention.</p>
    <p>In order to provide the desired message re-recordability in this embodiment of the present invention, message delivering circuit 24 comprises a "play" activation switch means 30 and a "record" activation switch means 31. As shown in FIG. 1, switch means 30 and 31 are connected to printed circuit board 24 at the desired contact points therefor.</p>
    <p>Once a message has been recorded on integrated circuit chip 25 of printed circuit board 24, the recorded message is audibly delivered whenever "play" activation switch 30 is pressed. By activating switch 30, message delivery circuit 22 is activated, causing the recorded message on chip 25 to be delivered through speaker 28. This message delivery process continues each time switch 30 is activated. If desired, LED 29 can be constructed to be illuminated whenever play activation switch 30 is pressed, thereby informing the user that message delivery circuit 22 is in the activated play mode.</p>
    <p>Whenever the user desires to record a new message, record activation switch means 31 is pressed in order to activate circuit 22 into the record mode. Once activated, the user states the desired message for receipt by microphone 27 with the message being recorded by integrated circuit chip 25, overwriting the previously recorded message. Once a new message has been received and recorded by chip 25, the new message is delivered through speaker 28 whenever desired, by activating play switch means 30. In this way, any desired message is easily recorded on message delivery circuit 22, with the recorded message being repeatedly delivered by circuit 22 each and every time play switch means 30 is activated.</p>
    <p>Although any desired arrangement can be employed, it is preferred that the record activation switch means 31 is constructed to require continued pressure or contact during the entire record mode. In this way, complete control over the record session by the user is assured.</p>
    <p>In the preferred embodiment, LED 29 is connected to message delivery circuit 22 for being activated each time record switch means 31 is activated. In this way, the user is notified by the illumination of LED 29 that the record mode is in progress. However, as discussed above, LED 29 can also be connected to be similarly illuminated whenever play activation switch means 30 is employed. In addition, if desired, a pause switch 32 is connected to printed circuit board 24 in order to enable individuals to pause during recording a message, without adversely affecting the timing of the message. In this way, greater flexibility and control is provided.</p>
    <p>In order to further enhance audible message delivery system 20 of the present invention and improve its universal applicability, message delivery circuit 22 also incorporates a second or alternate play activation switch means 35. In the preferred construction, alternate switch means 35 incorporates a longitudinally movable, elongated tab 36 cooperatively associated with contacts 37 and 38.</p>
    <p>In the preferred embodiment, tab 36 is positioned between spring biased contacts 37 and 38 in order to prevent contacts 37 and 38 from being normally electrically engaged with each other. However, when tab 36 is longitudinally moved out of interleaved relationship with contacts 37 and 38, the spring biased construction causes contacts 37 and 38 to touch each other, completing the circuit and activating message delivery circuit 22 into its play mode.</p>
    <p>By incorporating second play activation switch means 35 in addition to play activation switch means 30, a dual play activation configuration is achieved. As detailed herein, this construction enables audible, message delivery system 20 to be universally employable.</p>
