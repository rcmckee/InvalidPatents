    <p>This invention relates to a support system and in particular to a bicycle seat.</p>
    <p>The present invention is an improvement or modification to the seat as disclosed in my international application PCT/AU96/00273 and my international application PCT/AU94/00284. The contents of these earlier international applications are incorporated into this specification by this reference.</p>
    <p>This invention may be said, in the first aspect, to reside in a support system, including;</p>
    <p>a first support portion and a second support portion for receiving a riders buttocks; and</p>
    <p>and a hinge for allowing each of the first and second support portions to undergo independent arcuate movement having a component at least in a substantially vertical plane when the rider is seated on the support portions and performing a pedalling motion.</p>
    <p>This invention may also be said, in the first aspect, to reside in a support system, including;</p>
    <p>a first support portion and a second support portion for receiving a riders buttocks;</p>
    <p>a front portion coupled to the first and second support portions; and</p>
    <p>and a hinge between the first and second support portions and the front portion for allowing each of the first and second support portions to undergo substantially independent arcuate movement having a component at least in a substantially vertical plane when the rider is seated on the support portions and performing a pedalling motion.</p>
    <p>According to this aspect of the invention the independent arcuate movement of the support portions provides both comfort and energy return to the person when the person is seated on the support portion and performing a pedalling motion such as that performed when riding a bicycle. Furthermore because of the movement of the support portions friction is reduced which in turn reduces chaffing.</p>
    <p>Preferably the first and second support portions are separated by a longitudinal slot. However, in other embodiments the first and second support portions could be connected by a thin longitudinal hinge member so the first and second portions are formed on a single support member and wherein the longitudinal hinge allows independent arcuate movement of the first and second support portions.</p>
    <p>Preferably the hinge comprises a first hinge between the first support portion and the front portion and a second between the second support portion and the front portion.</p>
    <p>Preferably the support system includes an integral shell which includes the first and second support portions, the front portion and the hinge with the hinge being defined by a transition between the support portions and the front portion.</p>
    <p>In the embodiment of the invention where the support system includes the integral shell, the integral shell including the hinge is preferably formed from a resilient plastics material such as nylon 6, 6 polycarbonate, polyethylene or the like so that the first and second support portions can move in the arcuate direction by flexure of the hinge and the resilient nature of the material will cause the first and second support portions to tend to return to their initial position as load is removed from them during pedalling motion.</p>
    <p>Preferably the shell is provided with upholstery which covers the shell.</p>
    <p>Preferably the support system has connecting means for connecting the support system to an article, the connecting means being coupled to the front portion between a front end of the front portion and the hinge so as not to interfere with flexing movement of the hinge and the arcuate movement of the first and second support portions.</p>
    <p>Preferably the connecting means comprise connecting rails.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment the connecting rails are coupled to the shell by embedding portions of the rails into the shell when the shell is formed. In other embodiments the rails may be coupled to the shell by securement members which are attached to the shell or which are formed integral with the shell. In still further embodiments the rails may be formed integral with the shell.</p>
    <p>Preferably support portions are cupped shaped for receiving the ischial bone region and buttock region of a rider.</p>
    <p>Preferably the front portion comprises a truncated nose.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment the front portion includes a soft padding to extend the length of the truncated nose. In this embodiment the soft padding merely collapses when contacted by a rider so that the front portion has the appearance of a conventional bicycle seat with an elongated nose but the front portion preforms little or no vertical support function for a rider. In this embodiment, the front portion may provide some lateral support function to assist in stability and centring of the rider on the seat.</p>
    <p>A further aspect of the invention may be said to reside in a support system including;</p>
    <p>first and second support portions, the first and second support portions-each having a depression for receiving the ischial regions of a persons anatomy;</p>
    <p>a raised portion between and forward of the depressions of the first and second support portions, for receiving the ramus of the ischial regions or the ischial regions of a persons anatomy;</p>
    <p>and a nose section which extends forwardly of the support portions and which declines from the support portions towards a front end of the nose section.</p>
    <p>In this aspect of the invention the support is configured so that most of the riders weight will be centred on the ischial bones and buttock region of the rider and supported in the depressions of the first and second support portions. This therefore decreases the amount of compression of the users anatomy other than the vicinity of the ischial bones to increase comfort and prevent significant pressure from being applied to other portions of the buttocks outside the ischial region.</p>
    <p>Preferably the first and second support portions are separated by an elongated slot.</p>
    <p>Preferably the first and second support portions and the front portion are integral with one another by being made as an integral shell.</p>
    <p>Preferably the support portion includes upholstery on the shell.</p>
    <p>A further aspect of the invention may be said to reside in a support system, including;</p>
    <p>a support portion for receiving a users buttocks;</p>
    <p>a truncated nose extending forwardly from the support portion;</p>
    <p>a soft collapsible upholstery member provided on the nose portion for extending the nose portion forwardly and/or upwardly with respect to the support portions.</p>
    <p>According to this aspect of the invention the self collapsible member on the nose portion gives the seat the appearance of a conventional bicycle seat but nevertheless performs little or no vertical support function because of the collapsibility of the material when pressure is applied to it. This reduces pressure to the soft tissue of the nose section against a user when on the support system. The soft collapsible material provides a centring member so that a person can centre him or herself on the support portion relative to the truncated nose and the collapsible material and truncated nose may also provide some lateral support to assist centring and stability of a rider when seated on the support system.</p>
    <p>The self collapsible material may be a foam or sponge material or polyurethane or the like.</p>
    <p>Preferably the support portions and truncated nose are formed as a integral shell from plastics materials such as nylon 6,6 polycarbonate, polyethylene or like material.</p>
    <p>The invention may also be said to reside in a bicycle seat, including:</p>
    <p>a unitary shell having a nose portion and a rear portion, the shell being formed from a flexible material;</p>
    <p>a slot in the rear portion dividing the rear portion into two separate support portions; and</p>
    <p>each of the support portions being independently movable relative to the nose portion and each other by flexure of the flexible material from which the shell is formed so that a transition between the two separate support portions and the nose portion forms a hinge allowing the two separate support portions to undergo substantially independently movement when a rider is seated on the bicycle seat and pedalling a bicycle.</p>
    <p>Preferably the bicycle seat includes a cushioning skin over an upper surface of the unitary shell.</p>
    <p>Preferably the shell has an upper surface and a lower surface, a plurality of ribs projecting from the lower surface.</p>
    <p>Preferably a mounting rail is coupled to the lower surface of the shell.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of the invention, the mounting rail extends to a position below the support portions and a spring is arranged between the mounting rail and each support portion.</p>
    <p>The spring may be a coil spring which is connected to the mounting rail and to the shell.</p>
    <p>In other embodiments, the spring may be integral with the mounting rail and be defined by a curved or bent portion of the mounting rail.</p>
    <p>Preferably the nose portion has an undercut for receiving a front portion of the mounting rail to secure the front portion of the mounting rail to the shell.</p>
    <p>Preferably stop means is provided for limiting movement of the two support portions.</p>
    <p>Preferably the stop means comprise end portions of the mounting bracket which are spaced from the lower surface of the shell.</p>
    <p>A further aspect of the invention may be said to reside in a bicycle seat, including:</p>
    <p>a nose portion;</p>
    <p>a rear support portion coupled to the nose portion, the rear support portion having first and second support portions;</p>
    <p>a hinge for allowing each of the first and second support portions to undergo substantially independent movement relative to one another and the nose portion, the independent arcuate movement having a component at least in a substantially vertical plane when the rider is seated on the support portions and forming a pedalling motion; and</p>
    <p>stop means for limiting the amount of movement of the first and second support portions.</p>
    <p>Preferably the bicycle seat includes a mounting rail for mounting the seat to a bicycle and the stop means comprises end portions of the mounting rail which are spaced from the first and second support portions and positioned below the first and second support portions.</p>
    <p>The invention in a further aspect may be said to reside in a bicycle seat, including:</p>
    <p>a nose portion;</p>
    <p>a rear portion for receiving a rider's buttocks;</p>
    <p>the nose portion and rear support portion having an upper surface and a lower surface;</p>
    <p>a mounting rail coupled to the lower surface;</p>
    <p>a cut-out in the nose portion for receiving a front portion of the mounting rail to hold the front portion of the mounting rail to the bicycle seat; and</p>
    <p>securing means for securing the mounting rail to the lower surface substantially at a middle portion of the lower surface so the rear portion is free and not connected to the mounting rail.</p>
    <p>Preferably the securing means comprises a bracket and bolt and nut for clamping the mounting rail to the lower surface.</p>
    <p>Preferably the bolt is embedded in the shell for receiving the nut and the bracket to couple the bracket and therefore the mounting rail to the bicycle seat.</p>
    <p>In a further aspect, the invention may be said to reside in a support system including:</p>
    <p>an inflatable housing which defines a chamber for receiving a fluid; and</p>
    <p>wherein when a user is supported by the support system and moves, fluid is caused to move from one part of the housing to another part of the housing so that the said one part can change its shape and/or form and the fluid flow to said another part causes the said another part to change its shape and/or form in response to the change in fluid in said another part of the housing.</p>
    <p>Thus, with the support system according to this aspect of the invention, when a user is supported by the support system and the user moves, fluid is caused to move from one part to another part to change the shape of the support system to facilitate support. In one embodiment the support system is a bicycle seat. In the case of a bicycle seat, as a user is pedalling, movement of the legs and buttocks during pedalling can place an increase in pressure on one part of the seat so that fluid is forced from that part to another part which has less pressure on it so that that part can expand so as to maintain some contact and support of the user notwithstanding the reduction in pressure applied by the user during riding. The fluid can basically move back and forward as the rider pedals to result in one part of the seat collapsing and then reinflating as the fluid moves back and forward during pedaling so that various parts of the seat collapse under the weight of the user or expand to maintain contact of the seat with the user and mimic movement of the user as the user pedals the bicycle.</p>
    <p>Preferably the housing includes a fluid inlet in the housing for enabling fluid to enter the housing.</p>
    <p>Preferably the housing includes rigid sections so that the general shape of the housing is maintained notwithstanding the fact that the housing is able to expand or collapse during movement of the user on the seat.</p>
    <p>The housing may be a single chamber which changes form. However, preferably the housing includes two housing portions joined by a fluid passage so that when fluid passes from one part of the housing to the another part of the housing, the fluid passes through the fluid passage to thereby direct the fluid to particular parts of the housing for expansion of those parts of the housing. By selecting the position of the fluid passage, various parts of the housing can be made to expand more or less than others depending on the particular use of the seat or needs of a particular user.</p>
    <p>Preferably the housing is made from elastomeric material such as rubber, elasticated plastic or like stretchable material to enable expansion and contraction of the housing as the fluid moves from one part of the housing to another part of the housing.</p>
    <p>Preferably the seat has a base plate for supporting the housing.</p>
    <p>Preferably the base plate has attachment means for attaching the seat to an article.</p>
    <p>Preferably the attachment means comprises a pair of rails.</p>
    <p>Preferably the seat is a bicycle seat but in other embodiments, the seat could be a lounge chair or like seat, or a medical application appliance such as a therapeutic or rehabilitation or harness like appliance.</p>
    <p>A still further aspect of the invention may be said to reside in a support system including:</p>
    <p>a first portion;</p>
    <p>a second portion;</p>
    <p>the first and second portions being coupled to one another by spring material so that the first portion can move in response to a user's weight and/or pressure applied by a user when a user is supported by the support system and return as a user moves and reduces pressure and/or weight on that portion of the support system.</p>
    <p>Thus, in this aspect of the invention, the support system is also able to generally follow the movement of the user's anatomy as the user moves on the support system.</p>
    <p>Preferably the first portion of the support system includes two separate sections.</p>
    <p>Preferably the first portion of the support system and the second portion of the support system are formed from spring material and the hinge is an integral part of the support system forming a transition between the first and second portions.</p>
    <p>In another embodiment of the support system, the first and second portions may be formed from non-spring material and be coupled together by a hinge section formed from spring material.</p>
    <p>A further aspect of the invention may be said to reside in a support system, including:</p>
    <p>an abutment portion within the support system;</p>
    <p>biasing means for biasing the abutment portion relative to the support system so that the abutment portion can move relative to the support system; and</p>
    <p>the biasing means providing a floating support for the abutment portions so that the abutment portion can move relative to the support system against the bias of the biasing means in response to the weight or pressure of a user when supported by the support system.</p>
    <p>The biasing means may comprise a pad or block of resilient material, a spring, or air, for biasing the abutment portion relative to the support system.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, the support system is a seat and includes a cover member for covering the seat surface portion and the abutment portion.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of the invention, the seat includes a single abutment portion which may be in the pubic area. However, in other embodiments, two or more abutment portions could be used. Furthermore, the abutment portion or abutment portions may be arranged at different positions on the seat to provide different support characteristics depending on the position at which the abutment portion is located.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of the invention, the abutment portions are disc-shaped and in the embodiment where the biasing means comprises air, the abutment members may be hollow members formed from elastic material to enable expansion of the abutment members so as to move the abutment portion relative to the seat surface portion, or alternatively the biasing means may be an inflatable chamber below the abutment portion.</p>
    <p>The biasing means may also be in the form of an air spring.</p>
    <p>In other embodiments, the abutment portions may be ramp-shaped so as to form an inclined abutment portion.</p>
    <p>According to a still further aspect of the invention there is provided a support system, including:</p>
    <p>at least two separate chambers in the support system; and</p>
    <p>a fluid inlet to each of the chambers for allowing fluid to enter each of the chambers.</p>
    <p>This aspect of the invention enables the at least two chambers to be inflated by fluid to different degrees to provide different support characteristics at the location of the two chambers.</p>
    <p>A further aspect of the present invention may be said to reside in a support system including:.</p>
    <p>an inflatable abutment portion coupled to the support system;</p>
    <p>a fluid inlet to the inflatable abutment portion for coupling with a fluid reservoir for retaining a supply of fluid; and</p>
    <p>fluid control means for allowing flow of fluid from the fluid reservoir to the inflatable abutment portion.</p>
    <p>This aspect of the invention enables an inflatable abutment portion to be inflated to provide an abutment for high performance racing o r the like or to merely change the setting surface characteristics of the support system to suit a user. The fluid control means enables a certain amount of fluid to be supplied to the inflatable abutment portion to either fully inflate the abutment portion so that the abutment portion effectively forms a generally rigid abutment portion or to partially inflate the abutment portion so that the abutment portion is able to move under the weight and/or pressure of a user and to follow the change in contour of a user's anatomy as a user moves on the support system.</p>
    <p>Preferably the fluid reservoir is coupled to the control means.</p>
    <p>In the preferred embodiments of the invention, the fluid which is supplied to the housing or which is used to inflate the abutment portion(s) comprises air but in some embodiments of the invention if it is desired to minimise weight, a lighter gas such as helium could be utilised.</p>
    <p>Once again, in the preferred embodiment, the support system is a bicycle seat.</p>
    <p>In other embodiments, the gas may be some other gas applicable to particular types of fluid reservoirs such as carbon dioxide cartridges or the like, nitrogen or the reservoir may be a chamber manually inflated with air by a pump or the like.</p>
    <p>A still further aspect of the invention provides a support system including:</p>
    <p>a support portion; and</p>
    <p>at least one abutment portion in the support portion, the abutment portion being a fluid chamber for containing a fluid.</p>
    <p>Preferably the fluid chamber includes a fluid inlet and the fluid chamber is an inflatable chamber.</p>
    <p>A still further aspect of the invention provides a support system including:</p>
    <p>an abutment portion coupled to the support system;</p>
    <p>fluid receiving means for moving the abutment portion relative to the support system; and</p>
    <p>fluid control means for controlling the application of fluid to the fluid receiving means to provide a desired amount of movement of the abutment portion and/or lock of the abutment portion in a desired position relative to the support portion.</p>

    <p>With reference to FIGS. 1 and 6, a bicycle seat <b>10</b> is shown which has an integral shell <b>11</b> including first and second support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> which are separated by a longitudinal slot <b>16</b>. The shell <b>11</b> also has a front portion <b>18</b> which forms a nose of the seat <b>10</b> and which is integrally coupled to the support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p>The nose <b>18</b> and support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are coupled together by first and second hinges <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> which are also integral with the nose <b>18</b> and support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> and which are formed by a transition between the nose <b>18</b> and support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p>The shell <b>11</b> may be covered by upholstery <b>25</b> (see FIGS. 3, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>) which is formed from conventional padding material.</p>
    <p>In the preferred embodiment of the invention where the hinges <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> are integral with the remainder of the shell <b>11</b>, the shell is formed from a flexible material, for example, plastics material such as nylon 6,6 polycarbonate or polyethylene so that the combined effect of the slot <b>16</b> and the transition from the nose portion <b>18</b> to the support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> allows flexing movement of the support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> about the hinges <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> relative to the front portion <b>18</b>. However, in other embodiments the hinges <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> could be formed from suitable flexible material which is connected to separate front portion <b>18</b> and support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> which, in turn, are formed from rigid material. Further still, in other embodiments rather than providing the slot <b>16</b> a thin narrow longitudinal hinge line (not shown) may be provided between the portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> so that the portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are effectively formed as a single member with the portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> being able to move independently with respect to one another about the longitudinal hinge which joins the support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p>The support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are a mirror image with respect to one another and, as will be evident from the cross-sectional views forming FIGS. 3 to <b>6</b>, have a depression or recess <b>30</b> so that they are generally cupped shaped in configuration so as to snugly receive a portion of a riders buttocks adjacent the ischial bones. As is also apparent in FIG. 2 the portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> incline upwardly slightly relative to the front portion <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p>The support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> may also be provided on the underside of the shell <b>11</b> with a plurality of integral ribs <b>27</b> which extend from a rear end of the support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> to a position rearwardly of the hinges <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> as can be clearly seen in FIGS. 3 and 4.</p>
    <p>As is best seen in FIGS. 3 to <b>6</b> the portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> (only the portion <b>12</b> being shown in FIGS. 3 and 4) have a rim <b>32</b> which surrounds-the depressions or recesses <b>30</b>. The rim <b>32</b> has a downwardly curved outer edge <b>33</b>. As also shown in FIG. 2 a connecting rail <b>40</b> is coupled to the seat <b>10</b>. The rail <b>40</b> is connected between the hinges <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> and front end <b>42</b> of the nose <b>18</b> so that the rail <b>40</b> is confined to the nose <b>18</b> and does not interfere with movement of the hinge <b>22</b> or support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. Thus, when the rail <b>40</b> is coupled to a bicycle to secure the seat <b>10</b> to the bicycle (in a manner which is known) the front portion <b>18</b> is held substantially still and the support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are able to move by flexing movement of hinges <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> relative to the front portion <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p>As is best shown in FIG. 4 the shell <b>11</b> may be provided with an enlarged thickness portion <b>50</b> just forward of the hinges <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> and also an enlarged thickness portion <b>52</b> at the front end <b>42</b> of the nose <b>18</b>. The enlarged thickness areas <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> can provide bosses for receiving the rails <b>40</b> to secure the rails <b>40</b> to the shell <b>11</b>. Preferred methods of connecting the rails <b>40</b> to the shell <b>11</b> will be described in more detail hereinafter with reference to FIGS. 15 to <b>22</b>.</p>
    <p>As is best shown in FIG. 6 the nose <b>18</b> is preferably of inverted U-shape in cross-section and forms a raised portion <b>19</b> between the depressions or recesses <b>30</b> of the support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. As best shown in FIGS. 12 and 4 the nose <b>18</b> is angled downwardly from the hinges <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>.</p>
    <p>When a rider is seated on the bicycle seat of FIGS. 1 to <b>6</b> and commences pedalling motion the movement of the buttocks of the rider during pedalling will cause general oscillating movement of the support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> about hinges <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> independently of one another so that the portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> move in an arcuate manner as shown by arrow A in FIG. <b>2</b>. The arcuate movement is mainly in a substantially vertical plane which is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the bicycle so that the arcuate movement has a major component in that vertical plane. However, some lateral movement of the portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> may also take place as shown by arrows B in FIG. 5 so that the arcuate movement also has a component in a generally vertically plane which is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the bicycle. Thus, the arcuate movement in the vertical plane which is perpendicular to the axis of the bicycle is generally a minor component movement compared to the arcuate movement which is in the plane parallel to the longitudinal axis of the bicycle.</p>
    <p>The arcuate movement of the support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> provides comfortable support for the rider as the rider pedals the bicycle and also some energy return back into the users body due to the generally spring action or flexing provided by the hinges <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> which tends to return the portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> to their starting position as the rider moves. Thus, the rider is comfortably supported in an energy sufficient manner for pedalling of the bicycle.</p>
    <p>In the embodiments of FIGS. 1 to <b>6</b> the seat <b>10</b> has the appearance of a generally conventional long nosed bicycle seat apart from the slot <b>16</b>. If the slot <b>16</b> is covered by the upholstery material the seated embodiments of FIGS. 1 to <b>6</b> would, for intense purposes, look like any conventional long nosed leather bicycle seat but with a downwardly curved nose.</p>
    <p>The embodiment of the invention shown in FIGS. 7 and 8 has the same general appearance as the embodiment of FIGS. 1 to <b>6</b> and is structured identically to FIGS. 1 to <b>6</b> except that the front portion <b>18</b> of the shell <b>11</b> is in the form of a truncated nose <b>18</b> which is much shorter than the nose <b>18</b> in the embodiments of FIGS. 1 to <b>6</b>. In the embodiments of FIGS. 7 and 8 the upholstery <b>25</b> <i>a </i>is much thicker in the front portion <b>21</b> of the seat <b>10</b> and effectively extends the length of the front <b>21</b> so that the front portion <b>21</b> has the same appearance as the nose <b>18</b> in FIGS. 1 to <b>6</b>. However, the upholstery <b>25</b> <i>a </i>which is in the vicinity of the nose <b>18</b> and extends the length of the front portion <b>21</b> in the embodiment of FIGS. 7 and 8 is of a very soft material such as soft foam or sponge material, “nerf” type material, polyethylene or like material so that it will readily collapse as soon as the user places any weight on it at all. Thus, the front portion <b>21</b> in embodiments of FIGS. 7 and 8 provides little or no support in the vertical direction and therefore reduces the pressure of the soft tissue of a rider when pedalling. The purpose of the soft upholstery portion <b>25</b> <i>a </i>in the embodiments <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> gives the appearance of a conventional seat whilst at the same time reducing the support function of the nose <b>18</b> and also therefore reduces pressure to soft tissue.</p>
    <p>The front portion <b>21</b> in the embodiment of FIGS. 7 and 8 does provide some centring datum so that the rider can properly centre himself on the support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> relative to the front portion <b>21</b> and also provide some lateral stability for the rider when seated on the seat and during cornering. Nevertheless, the general support provided by the front portion <b>21</b> in the embodiments of FIGS. 7 and 8 is intended to be considerably less than that provided in the previous embodiment and the very soft upholstery material <b>25</b> <i>a </i>is intended to collapse when weight is applied to it so as to basically form no load bearing function thereby reducing any chaffing which the nose portion of a bicycle seat normally produces.</p>
    <p>Apart from the inclusion of the truncated nose section <b>18</b> and the relatively thicker yet softer upholstery material <b>25</b> <i>a </i>in the front portion <b>21</b> the bicycle seat of FIGS. 7 and <b>8</b> functions in exactly the same manner as that of FIGS. 1 to <b>6</b>.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 9 and 10 show a third embodiment of the invention which is also similar to FIGS. 1 to <b>6</b> except that in this embodiment the front portion <b>18</b> is in the form of a truncated nose <b>18</b> substantially identical to that of FIGS. 7 and 8. However, in this embodiment the elongated soft upholstery material of FIGS. 7 and 8 is not provided so that the seat has the appearance of a very short nosed seat as is evident from FIGS. 9 and 10.</p>
    <p>As is shown in FIGS. 11 to <b>14</b> upholstery material <b>25</b> is provided and generally follows the contour of the shell <b>11</b> of FIGS. 9 and 10 similar to the upholstery <b>25</b> in FIGS. 1 to <b>6</b>.</p>
    <p>In the embodiments of FIGS. 9 to <b>14</b> the ribs <b>27</b> run the entire length of the shell <b>11</b> from rear <b>55</b> to front end <b>42</b> and the support portion <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are slightly wide then in the embodiment of FIGS. 1 to <b>6</b>.</p>
    <p>The hinges <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> at support portion <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> of the embodiment of FIGS. 9 to <b>14</b> operates in precisely the same manner as in the embodiment of FIGS. 1 to <b>6</b>.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 15 to <b>22</b> show preferred ways of coupling the mounting rails <b>40</b> to the shell <b>11</b> of the bicycle seat <b>10</b>. In FIG. 15 a plate <b>70</b> is provided and rails <b>40</b> are connected to the plate <b>70</b>. The plate <b>70</b> can be bolted or glued to shell <b>11</b> or can be embedded in the shell <b>11</b> between the hinges <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> and the front <b>42</b> of the nose <b>18</b> during moulding of the shell <b>11</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 16 shows a slightly different configuration of the rails <b>40</b> in which the rails <b>40</b> are formed from a single piece having a U-shaped transition <b>41</b>. The ends of the rails <b>40</b> are provided with circular plates <b>43</b> which can be embedded in the shell <b>11</b> when the shell is moulded.</p>
    <p>FIG. 17 shows an embodiment similar to that shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 where the rails <b>40</b> have laterally projecting ends <b>47</b> which are received in the thickened portions <b>50</b>. The ends <b>47</b> may be embedded in the thickened portions <b>50</b> when the shell <b>11</b> is moulded or alternatively holes may be provided in the thickened portions <b>50</b> for receiving the ends <b>47</b>. The U-shaped transition <b>41</b> can be received in a slot in portion <b>52</b>.</p>
    <p>The distance between the thickened portions <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> and the size of the rails <b>40</b> may be such that when the rails <b>40</b> are located in place they are placed under slight tension to securely maintain the rails <b>40</b> in place on the shell <b>11</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 18 shows an embodiment in which the nose <b>18</b> has moulded to it two generally cylindrical bosses <b>59</b> which are provided with holes <b>61</b> for receiving the ends <b>47</b> of the rails <b>40</b>. The transition <b>41</b> of the rails may be received in slot <b>74</b> at the front <b>42</b> of the nose <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 19 is a side view of the nose <b>18</b> and rails <b>40</b> according to the embodiment of FIG. 18 more clearly showing the location of the transition portion <b>41</b> in the slot <b>74</b>. In this embodiment a fastener <b>75</b> may be located through a return portion <b>18</b>′ of the nose <b>18</b> to securely hold the transition portion <b>41</b> of the rails <b>40</b> in place in the slot <b>74</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 20 merely shows a different embodiment of the rail <b>40</b> wherein the rail is provided with ends <b>47</b>′ which are turned inwardly in the opposite direction to the direction of the ends <b>47</b> in FIGS. 17, <b>18</b> and <b>19</b>. In this embodiment the transition portion <b>41</b> is square in shape rather than U-shaped as in the earlier embodiments. The legs <b>47</b>′ could be embedded in the shell <b>11</b> during the moulding.</p>
    <p>FIG. 21 shows a further embodiment in which a stud <b>80</b> can be embedded in the shell <b>11</b> when the shell <b>11</b> is formed. The stud <b>80</b> has a sleeve <b>82</b> having screw threads <b>83</b>. Stud <b>80</b> also has a base <b>85</b> which has prongs <b>87</b> which embed in the shell <b>11</b> to securely locate the stud in place. The rails <b>40</b> are provided with screw threads <b>40</b>′ on a free end thereof which screw into the screw threads <b>83</b> in the sleeves <b>82</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 22 shows a further embodiment in which the rails <b>40</b> are formed integrally with the nose <b>18</b> from the same material as the nose <b>18</b>. In this embodiment the rails <b>40</b> have integral legs <b>65</b> which extend between the rails <b>40</b> and the nose <b>18</b> to couple the rails to the shell <b>11</b>. The embodiment of FIG. 1 is a sleeker design for more high performance applications and may be relatively light whereas FIG. 9 is designed more for additional lateral width for recreational purposes.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 23 to <b>36</b> show a fourth embodiment of the invention in which like reference numerals indicate like parts to those previously described.</p>
    <p>As in the previous embodiments the seat is formed from a shell <b>11</b> of resilient material such as injection moulded plastics material, for example, nylon <b>6</b>,<b>6</b> or polypropylene. An upholstery <b>25</b> may be provided over the upper surface <b>11</b> <i>a </i>of the shell <b>11</b> as will be described in more detail hereinafter.</p>
    <p>The shell <b>11</b> has rear buttock support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> separated by a slot <b>16</b> and a front nose portion <b>18</b>. Once again an integral hinge-is formed in the regions <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> between the support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> and the nose <b>18</b> so that the support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> can undergo independent arcuate movement relative to one another and also the nose section <b>18</b> in the same manner as has been previously described.</p>
    <p>The support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are slightly dish-shaped in the areas <b>30</b> and rise upwardly to the portion <b>19</b> and also upper peripheral edge <b>110</b> which delimits the rear support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. The contouring will be more fully described and apparent from the cross-sectional drawings which will be described hereinafter.</p>
    <p>As is clear from FIGS. 24 and 25 the shell <b>11</b> also includes a downwardly projecting skirt portion <b>112</b> which extends about the periphery of the seat from upper peripheral edge <b>110</b> to lower extremity <b>132</b>. The skirt portion <b>112</b> is of greatest height at the side of the seat as shown in FIGS. 29 and 31, slightly of less height at the rear as shown in FIG. <b>32</b> and of lowermost height at the front portion of the nose <b>18</b> as shown in FIG. <b>31</b>.</p>
    <p>As is apparent from FIGS. 25 and 26 the lower surface <b>11</b> <i>b </i>of the shell <b>11</b> has downwardly projecting ribs <b>114</b>. The ribs <b>114</b> are of generally curved contour and outermost rib <b>114</b>′ (see FIG. 26) is somewhat longer than the middle rib <b>114</b>″ which, in turn, is somewhat longer than the innermost rib <b>114</b>′″ of each of the support sections <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 26 mounting rail <b>40</b> is secured to the lower surface <b>11</b> <i>b </i>by a nut <b>116</b> and bracket <b>118</b>. A bolt <b>117</b> is embedded in the shell <b>11</b> for receiving the nut <b>116</b> (as best seen in FIG. <b>31</b>). The shell <b>11</b> has a cut-out <b>120</b> which receives a front portion <b>122</b> of the rail <b>40</b> as will be described in more detail hereinafter to secure the front portion <b>122</b> of the rail <b>40</b> to the shell <b>11</b>.</p>
    <p>The bracket <b>118</b> clamps the rail <b>40</b> to the lower surface <b>11</b> <i>b </i>of the shell <b>11</b>. The bracket <b>118</b> may have curved sections <b>126</b> for accommodating the rail <b>40</b> and securely fastening the rail <b>40</b> to the shell <b>11</b>. The lower surface <b>11</b> <i>b </i>of the shell may also have guide projections or groove <b>145</b> <i>a </i>(FIG. 28) for correctly positioning the rail <b>40</b>. The rail. <b>40</b> will be more fully described with reference to FIGS. 34 to <b>36</b>.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 27 to <b>29</b> are cross-sectional views across the seat of FIG. 23 showing the curvature of the nose portion <b>18</b> and the support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> in a direction transverse to the longitudinal direction of the seat and the bicycle upon which the seat will be used.</p>
    <p>As can be clearly seen from FIGS. 27, <b>28</b> and <b>29</b> the lower extremity <b>132</b> of the shell <b>11</b> is formed with a step <b>130</b> on the lower surface lib. Step <b>130</b> accommodates the upholstery material <b>25</b> so that the upholstery material can wrap around the bottom extremity <b>132</b> (see FIG. 28) of the shell <b>11</b> and still remain flush with the lower surface <b>11</b> <i>b </i>of the shell <b>11</b>. This assists in securing the upholstery <b>25</b> to the shell <b>11</b> by increasing the surface area and also prevents the likelihood of any contact beneath the seat rolling the upholstery from the lower extremity <b>132</b> as would more likely be the case if the upholstery <b>25</b> is not flush with the lower surface <b>11</b> <i>b </i>of the shell <b>11</b>.</p>
    <p>The upholstery <b>25</b> is preferably formed by a self-skinning polyurethane which in a moulding process adheres or otherwise connects onto the shell <b>11</b>, foams into the desired moulded shape and provides cushioning for the bicycle seat. The outer surface of the polyurethane upholstery <b>25</b> forms a firm skin formed with any desired texture. The moulding of the shell <b>11</b> and the upholstery <b>25</b> can therefore be formed in a single operation. Alternatively, upholstery <b>25</b> can be formed separately and connected to the shell <b>11</b> in a separate operation. Furtherstill, the application of the upholstery can be a combination of the two processes, for example, the cushioning can be formed in the moulding process and a outer cover or skin can be adhered onto the moulded cushioning to complete the upholstery <b>25</b>. Apart from adhering the upholstery <b>25</b> to the shell <b>11</b> in a moulding operation or by a separate adhesive process, the upholstery <b>25</b> can be stapled onto the shell or otherwise fixed to the shell <b>11</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 29 also shows a thickened region <b>147</b> arranged directly above the rear portions <b>145</b> of the rails <b>40</b> which form the stop members, the thickened portions <b>147</b> are slightly angled as shown in FIG. <b>29</b> and provide a reinforced area on the lower surface <b>11</b> <i>b </i>of the shell <b>11</b> so that when the seat bottoms out and contacts the end portions <b>145</b>, the thickened areas <b>147</b> provide added strength to resist-any tendency for fracturing of the shell <b>11</b> and wearing through of the shell <b>11</b> due to contact between the lower surface <b>11</b> <i>b </i>and the end portions <b>145</b>. Generally the thickened areas <b>147</b> are in the form of a strip which follows the end portions <b>145</b> and arranged directly above the end portions <b>145</b> as shown in FIG. <b>29</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 30 shows a side view of the seat and as apparent from FIG. 30 the seat is normally positioned in a slightly inclined position. The rail <b>40</b> has a connection section <b>141</b> which will couple to a clamp assembly on a bicycle so as to connect the seat to the bicycle. The clamp assembly allows for some arcuate adjustment of the seat so that the angle and position of the seat can be adjusted from that shown in FIG. 30 between a more inclined position and a less inclined position depending on the rider's requirement. Generally a more inclined position will be used for high performance riding such as racing and a lower incline will be used for more recreational and comfortable riding.</p>
    <p>FIG. 30 also shows the seat mounted on a bicycle generally designated by the reference numeral <b>200</b>. The bicycle <b>200</b> includes a frame <b>201</b> having a sleeve or hollow socket <b>203</b>, a central frame member <b>204</b> and a downwardly inclined and rearwardly extending frame member <b>205</b>. Other frame components and parts of the bicycle are not shown in FIG. <b>30</b>. The sleeve <b>203</b> receives in telescopic fashion, a support post <b>207</b> which can be locked in position by a nut and bolt <b>209</b> which clamps a flange portion <b>211</b> of the sleeve <b>203</b> to clamp the sleeve <b>203</b> about the post <b>207</b>. The post <b>207</b> carries a clamp assembly <b>209</b> which engages the rails <b>40</b> at the portions <b>141</b>. The clamp assembly <b>209</b> is clamped in position and seats on a cup-shaped support portion <b>210</b> at the top of the post <b>207</b>. A bolt <b>212</b> and nut <b>213</b> pass through the portion <b>210</b> and the clamp <b>209</b> to clamp the clamp <b>209</b> to the rails <b>40</b> and also to locate the clamp portion <b>209</b> on the portion <b>210</b>. By loosening the bolt <b>212</b>, the rails <b>40</b> can be moved back and forward in the direction of double headed arrow H within the clamp <b>209</b> and the clamp <b>209</b> can be pivoted slightly on surface <b>215</b> of cup-shaped portion <b>210</b> to position the seat <b>10</b> shown in FIG. 30 in the desired orientation relative to the bicycle frame <b>201</b>.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 31 to <b>33</b> are cross-sectional views along the lines D—D, E—E and F—F respectively and show the contour of the nose portion <b>18</b> and support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the seat and bicycle upon which the seat is to be used.</p>
    <p>FIG. 31 shows bolt <b>117</b> embedded in hole <b>124</b> in the shell <b>11</b> which receives the nut <b>116</b> to retain the bracket <b>118</b> in clamping engagement with the rail <b>40</b> to secure the rail <b>40</b> to the shell <b>11</b>. FIG. 31 also shows that the nose section <b>18</b> of the shell includes the undercut <b>120</b> which is in the form of a slot or a socket for receiving front portion <b>122</b> of the rail <b>40</b>. Thus, the front <b>22</b> of the rail <b>40</b> is securely held in the undercut <b>120</b> and the rear portion of the rail <b>40</b> is secured to the shell <b>11</b> by the bracket <b>118</b> so that the rail <b>40</b> is securely held to the shell <b>11</b> for mounting onto a bicycle.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 32 and 33 show the dish-shaped contouring of the portion <b>12</b> and the fact that the contour rises upwardly to the upper periphery <b>110</b> of that portion. The raised portion <b>19</b> is also clearly shown.</p>
    <p>As is show in FIGS. 32 and 33 the mounting bracket <b>40</b> has rearwardly extending free end sections <b>145</b> which are spaced from the lower surface lib of the shell <b>11</b>. The rear portions <b>145</b> form stop members which limit the amount of flexing movement of the portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> relative to one another and the nose <b>18</b> so that if a rider is pedalling the bicycle and severely high load is applied to the portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, such as may occur if going over bumps or the like, which would otherwise cause the portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> to flex about their hinges <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> to such a degree where the seat may be permanently distorted or broken, the end portions <b>145</b> will contact the lower surface <b>11</b> <i>b </i>adjacent the portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> to limit the amount of movement of the portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> to prevent permanent distortion or breaking of the seat. The end portions <b>145</b> being spaced from the lower surface <b>11</b> <i>b </i>of the shell <b>11</b> is also clearly shown in FIG. <b>29</b>. Thus, with reference to FIG. 29, downward movement of the portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> in the direction of arrow M in FIG. 29 will be limited by the end portions <b>145</b>. The spacing between the end portions <b>145</b> and the lower surface <b>11</b> <i>b </i>will be dependent on the amount of movement required of the portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> and the material from which those portions are made.</p>
    <p>As in the earlier embodiments the dish-shaped depressions <b>30</b> are contoured to receive the region of the anatomy where a majority of the rider's weight will be supported. The nose portion <b>18</b> is not intended to bear much, if any weight and normally sweeps downwards from the raised portion <b>19</b>. The nose <b>18</b> can act to give a centring and stabilising effect by contact with the inner thighs, for example, when cornering. The ribs <b>114</b> can be positioned to control the amount of flex about the hinges <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> formed by the transition of the shell <b>11</b> from the support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> to the nose portion <b>18</b>. Increasing the length and size of the ribs will tend to increase stiffness and therefore decrease the amount of flexing movement provided by the hinges <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>. Furthermore, by altering the direction of the ribs <b>114</b> irelative to the longitudinal axis of the bicycle and the seat the nature or the arcuate movement of the support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> can change from an arcuate movement generally in a plane parallel to the longitudinal axis of the seat and the bicycle upon which the seat is mounted to arcuate movement in a more lateral direction in a plane transverse with respect to the longitudinal axis of the seat and bicycle upon which the seat is mounted. The flex is also determined by the shell design and the material of the shell. Stiffer seats may be used for racing to provide quicker energy return by the flexing movement of the portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> and more flexible seats can be used for recreational use to increase comfort. The direction of the flex also depends on the use. The arcuate movement may be more linear (that is, in the longitudinal direction of the seat and bicycle) for racing whilst for recreational use it may be more lateral, (that is, in a plane transverse to the longitudinal axis of the seat).</p>
    <p>The seat may be used without the upholstery <b>25</b> in which case the shell <b>11</b> is preferably provided with a textured finish on the upper surface <b>11</b> <i>a </i>to prevent slippage.</p>
    <p>As previously mentioned, the shell <b>11</b> is formed most preferably by injection moulding and plastics additives such as glass fibre or the like can be added to stiffen the seat or otherwise alter the characteristics of the arcuate movement of the portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 34 to <b>36</b> show the rail <b>40</b> in more detail.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIGS. 34 to <b>35</b> the rail <b>40</b> includes the front portion <b>122</b> which is received in the undercut <b>120</b> of the shell <b>11</b>. The front portion <b>122</b> is generally semicircular and a pair of downwardly and outwardly curved transition sections <b>151</b> which extend from the front portion <b>122</b>. A pair of parallel connecting rails <b>141</b> extend from the transition sections <b>151</b> rearwardly to upwardly extending sections <b>153</b>. The pair of upwardly extending sections <b>153</b> extend into a paid of rearwardly and slightly upwardly inclined sections <b>157</b> and those sections extend into outwardly extending sections <b>159</b> which, in turn, extend into the end sections <b>145</b> which form the stop members. Alternatively the sections <b>159</b> and <b>145</b> could form a continuously curved profile.</p>
    <p>The rail portions <b>141</b> are the portions of the mounting rail <b>40</b> which couple onto a clamp arrangement of a bicycle to secure the seat to the bicycle.</p>
    <p>The sections <b>157</b> form abutment sections which abut the lower side <b>11</b> <i>b </i>of the shell <b>11</b> and which are engaged by the clamp bracket <b>118</b> to secure the rear portion of the mounting rail <b>40</b> to the shell <b>11</b> as has been described.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 37, <b>38</b> and <b>39</b> show a further embodiment of the invention which is similar to the seat described with reference to FIGS. 23 to <b>35</b>. The seat includes an integral shell <b>11</b> which is formed in the same manner as the above mentioned embodiment. The seat includes the integral hinge and the other features previously described. However, for ease of illustration, the shell is only schematically shown in FIGS. 37 to <b>39</b>. A mounting rail <b>40</b> is coupled to the underside of the shell <b>11</b> by a nut and bracket arrangement <b>180</b>. The mounting rail <b>40</b> is different to the previous embodiments in that it extends further to the rear of the seat to a position below the buttock support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. Arranged between the ends <b>40</b>″ of the mounting rail <b>40</b> below the support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are coil springs <b>182</b>. The coil springs <b>182</b> are coupled to the shell <b>11</b> by bolts <b>183</b> which can be screwed into holes formed in the shell <b>11</b> or can be embedded in the shell <b>11</b> and have nuts (not shown) coupled to the bolts for securing the coil springs <b>182</b> in place. The lower end of the coil springs <b>182</b> are connected to the ends <b>40</b>″ of the mounting rail <b>40</b> by a bolt and nut arrangement <b>184</b>.</p>
    <p>The seat functions in the same manner as described with reference to the embodiment of FIGS. 23 to <b>35</b> except that the springs <b>182</b> act to slightly dampen the movement of the support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> and also to facilitate return of the support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> during pedalling motion.</p>
    <p>In the side view shown in FIG. 38, the front portion of the rail <b>40</b> is secured to the shell <b>11</b> in a slightly different fashion to that shown in FIG. <b>37</b>. In FIG. 38, the rail <b>40</b> passes through a loop or eye <b>185</b> which in turn is connected to the shell <b>11</b> by a bolt and nut arrangement <b>186</b>.</p>
    <p>In the rear view shown in FIG. 40, the slot <b>16</b> between the support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> is provided with a bridging section <b>187</b> which is flexible in nature and merely provided for aesthetic purposes. The bridging section <b>187</b> allows movement of the support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> as previously described without altering or influencing the movement of those portions.</p>
    <p>FIG. 41 shows a further embodiment similar to FIG. 37 in which the springs <b>182</b> are replaced by an integral spring <b>190</b> formed integral with the rail <b>40</b>. The rail <b>40</b> may be formed from steel material and the curved portion of the rail <b>40</b> which forms the spring <b>190</b> provides the same spring effect as the coil springs <b>182</b> previously described. The rail <b>40</b> is connected to the front portion of the shell <b>11</b> in the same manner as described with reference to FIG. <b>39</b> and the end of the spring section <b>190</b> is secured to the shell <b>11</b> by locating the end <b>192</b> in a hole <b>194</b> in a boss <b>196</b> formed integral with the shell <b>11</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 42 shows a rear view of the embodiment of FIG. 41 but with the slot <b>16</b> omitted so that the support portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are continuous and can move independently in view of the flexibility of the shell <b>11</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 43 shows a bicycle seat <b>210</b> according to another embodiment of the invention. The seat <b>210</b> has a base plate <b>212</b> to which is welded or otherwise secured a pair of rails <b>214</b> to enable the seat <b>10</b> to be secured to a bicycle in a manner which is well known. The base plate <b>212</b> supports an inflatable hollow housing <b>216</b>. The housing <b>216</b> is preferably made from elastomeric material so that it can expand when inflated by the application of fluid to the interior of the housing <b>216</b>. An inlet valve <b>218</b> is provided in the housing <b>216</b> for enabling fluid to be pumped into the housing <b>216</b> by a conventional bicycle pump or any other suitable source of pressurised fluid.</p>
    <p>The housing <b>216</b> has two portions <b>216</b> <i>a </i>and <b>216</b> <i>b </i>which are joined by a bridging passage <b>220</b>. The portions <b>216</b> <i>a </i>and <b>216</b> <i>b </i>receive a part of the buttocks of a rider and the bridging passage <b>220</b> enables fluid, preferably air, to move from one portion <b>216</b> <i>a </i>to the other portion <b>216</b> <i>b </i>through the passage <b>220</b> as the rider pedals and as more is supplied to one of the sections <b>216</b> <i>a </i>or <b>216</b> <i>b </i>than the other of the sections <b>216</b> <i>a </i>or <b>216</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
    <p>The structure shown in FIG. 43 could be located on the seats shown in FIGS. 23 to <b>42</b> to act as the upholstery or cushioning for those seats.</p>
    <p>As is shown in FIG. 44, the section <b>216</b> <i>b </i>is shown slightly compressed and collapsed due to additional weight of a rider (not shown) applied to that portion during pedalling of a bicycle. Fluid in the portion <b>216</b> <i>b </i>therefore passes through the passage <b>220</b> into the portion <b>216</b> <i>a </i>and the portion <b>216</b> <i>a </i>is inflated further by the fluid which passes from the portion <b>216</b> <i>a</i>. Thus, as pressure is applied to the portion <b>216</b> <i>b</i>, that portion can slightly collapse under the pressure of a rider and the portion <b>216</b> <i>a </i>which may have reduced pressure applied to it during cycling motion is able to expand to maintain support of the rider during pedalling motion. Thus, as the rider pedals, the portion <b>216</b> <i>a </i>and <b>216</b> <i>b </i>in turn basically collapse and expand as fluid is pushed from one portion <b>216</b> <i>a </i>to the other portion <b>216</b> <i>b </i>and then back from the portion <b>216</b> <i>b </i>to the portion <b>216</b> <i>a </i>during the pedalling motion so that the seat moves with the rider somewhat in seesaw fashion by virtue of the transfer of the fluid from the portion <b>216</b> <i>a </i>to the portion <b>216</b> <i>b</i>. This provides comfort to the rider because the seat is changing shape as the rider pedals and also provides support during the pedaling motion because the seat basically expands and collapses as pressure is applied and reduced to the seat during the pedalling motion.</p>
    <p>Preferably the housing <b>216</b> is reinforced by reinforcing such as ribbing, a cell structure, a support frame or the like (not shown) so that when air is applied to the inlet valve <b>218</b> to inflate the housing <b>210</b>, the housing <b>210</b> basically inflates to the share shown in FIG. 41 z fluid transfers between the portions <b>216</b> <i>a </i>and <b>216</b> <i>b</i>, the portions <b>216</b> <i>a </i>and <b>216</b> <i>b </i>inflate so that they increase in size relative to the position shown in FIG. 43 (as is shown in FIG. 44) but maintain the general shape of the portion shown in FIG. <b>43</b>. That is, the portions basically enlarge in size and maintain their shape during that enlargement rather than merely totally deforming to a spherical or like shape as pressure increases in the portions <b>216</b> <i>a </i>and <b>216</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
    <p>FIG. 45 shows an embodiment of the invention in which a seat <b>220</b> is in the form of a normal lounge seat or car seat etc rather than a bicycle seat and wherein the housing <b>210</b>′ is located in the seat <b>220</b> and which operates as described with reference to FIG. <b>43</b>. In this embodiment, the shape of the housing <b>210</b>′ may be different from that shown in FIG. 43 but as a user shifts his or her position on the seat, fluid will transfer from one part of the housing <b>210</b>′ to another part so that the housing expands and contracts during the movement generally in the same manner as described with reference to FIG. <b>43</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 46 shows a further embodiment in which the seat is of slightly different shape to that shown in FIG. <b>43</b>. In the embodiment of FIG. 46, the seat <b>210</b>″ has a pelvic area <b>230</b> and two side portions <b>232</b> which form supports for the ischial region of a rider's anatomy. The pelvic region <b>230</b> basically forms the passageway for transfer of fluid between the portions <b>232</b> in exactly the same manner as described with reference to FIG. <b>43</b>.</p>
    <p>Thus, in the embodiment of FIG. 46, the passageway <b>230</b> is basically in a different position to the passageway <b>220</b> in FIG. <b>43</b>. By locating the passageway in different positions, the nature of the transfer of fluid from one portion of the housing <b>210</b> or <b>210</b>′ or <b>210</b>″ to another portion of the housing can change to slightly alter the inflation or expansion characteristics of the various portions of the housing during movement of a user on the seat.</p>
    <p>Returning to FIG. 43, for example, if the passageway <b>220</b> was located as shown by the dotted lines in FIG. <b>43</b> and referenced by the numeral <b>220</b>′, more air may be applied to the front portion of the seat during fluid transfer to basically cause the front portion to inflate slightly greater than the rear portion of the seat which will change the shape characteristics slightly and therefore the nature of support during pedalling.</p>
    <p>FIG. 47 shows yet a further embodiment of the invention. In the embodiment of FIG. 47, a seat <b>240</b> is shown which has a pair of buttock support sections <b>242</b> which are separated by a longitudinal slot <b>244</b>. A horn section <b>244</b> joins the two buttock support sections <b>242</b> so that the seat is generally of the conventional shape of a bicycle seat except for the inclusion of the slot <b>244</b> between the buttock support sections <b>242</b>. Hinge portions <b>246</b> are provided between the buttock support sections <b>242</b> and the horn section <b>244</b> and the hinge sections <b>246</b> are made from spring material such as spring metal or spring plastics material or polymers. As is shown in FIG. 48, the buttock support sections <b>242</b> are angled upwardly at an angle with respect to the horn section <b>244</b> so that when a rider seats on the seat, the buttock support sections <b>242</b> will pivot about the spring material hinge <b>246</b> under the weight and/or pressure supplied by the user.</p>
    <p>The seat <b>240</b> may be formed from spring metal material or spring plastic material and in such an embodiment, the hinge sections <b>246</b> are merely integral portions of the seat <b>240</b> and defined by the transition areas between the buttock support sections <b>242</b> and the horn section <b>244</b>. However, in other embodiments, the buttock support sections <b>242</b> and the horn section <b>244</b> may be formed from non-spring material such as aluminium plate or steel plate and the buttock support sections <b>242</b> may be connected to the horn section <b>244</b> by the hinge portions <b>246</b> which are formed from spring material such as spring steel or spring plastic material.</p>
    <p>When a user seats on the bicycle seat of FIG. 47, the buttock support sections <b>242</b> will tend to move downwardly as shown by arrow A in FIG. <b>48</b> and also slightly towards the side as shown by arrow C in FIG. <b>49</b>. The separation of the buttock support sections <b>242</b> in FIG. 49 is exaggerated to show the slight sideways movement of the portion <b>242</b> as the user seats on the seat. During pedalling motion, the portions <b>242</b> will therefore tend to move upwardly and downwardly as shown by arrows D and E in FIG. 50 as the rider pedals and as pressure is applied to one of the portions <b>242</b> and then reduced and as pressure is applied to the other portion <b>242</b> so that the portions <b>242</b> basically move in paddle like or seesaw like movement during pedalling motion by the user.</p>
