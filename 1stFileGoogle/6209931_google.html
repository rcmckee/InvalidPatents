    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention relates to a multi-point door locking system.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>It is known to use multi-point door locks in sliding or french doors to provide secure closure and locking. In configuring a multi-point door lock there are a number of design considerations that must be made such that the door lock is easily manufactured, easily installed, functionally and aesthetically appealing, and secure.</p>
    <p>A main feature of a typical conventional multi-point door lock is that the door lock has more than one latch or bolt to engage a door frame. Plural latches or bolts create a lock that is substantially more difficult to overcome in a forcible entry than a single deadbolt and latch. Thus, it is desirable, for example, in a french door to have three bolts and a latch. A first bolt and latch engage with a second door. A second and third bolt engage the upper and lower portions of the door frame, respectively. Such door locks do not permit the addition of the second or third bolts or latches to the central locking unit. Further, such multi-point door locks are not adaptable to accommodate doors of various heights. Further still, such multi-point door locks are configured to be used with only one door type. For example, a conventional multi-point door lock may only have the option of allowing the second and third bolt or latch mechanisms to run along an edge of the door, even when it may be desirable to have the mechanisms fully concealed within the door itself.</p>
    <p>Conventional multi-point door locks may allow the second and third bolts or latches, which extend out the top and bottom of the door, to be extended even when the door is open. Therefore, if the door is slammed shut while the bolts are extended, the bolts may cause damage to the door, the door frame, or a door frame molding. Furthermore, such conventional multi-point door locks typically require extension of all the bolts or latches according to a specific sequence without allowing them to be extended independently of one another.</p>
    <p>Moreover, such conventional multi-point door locks are not easily reconfigurable for use as left handed or right handed doors. Furthermore, such conventional multi-point door locks require that a user must rotate the latch drive handle more than 45 degrees in order to fully engage or disengage the bolts.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provide for a multi-point door lock system having multiple bolts or latches designed to engage a door or a door frame. It would also be advantageous to provide for a multi-point door lock having a standard deadbolt and extension bolts or shoot bolts extending through the door. Further still, it would be advantageous to have a multi-point door lock with shoot bolts or extension bolts that extend either along the front edge of the door or through the interior of the door. Thus, it would be advantageous to have such a mechanism that is easily configurable for a variety of door designs.</p>
    <p>It would further be advantageous to provide for a multi-point door lock that has an activation button that allows actuation of at least one of the extension bolts or shoot bolts and the deadbolt when the activation button is depressed. Further, it would be desirable to have a multi-point door lock system in which the deadbolt may be extended independently of extension of the shoot bolts or extension bolts. Further still, it would be desirable to have a multi-point door lock system in which the extended extension bolts are prevented from retraction when the deadbolt is extended.</p>
    <p>It would further be advantageous to provide for a multi-point door lock system that is easily reconfigurable for one of a left hand door and a right hand door. It would further be advantageous to provide for a multi-point door lock in which the door lock handle actuates the door latch and provides a positive indication of when at least one extension bolt is extended. It would further be advantageous to provide for a multi-point door lock system such that the deadbolt and extension bolts move linearly at least one inch, thereby creating a more structurally sound locking system. It would further be advantageous to provide for a multi-point door lock system having fewer parts, especially fewer springs, creating an easily manufactured door lock.</p>
    <p>It would be desirable to provide for a multi-point door lock incorporating any one or more of these advantageous features.</p>

Doors <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> are rotatably coupled to door frame <b>54</b> by a set of hinges <b>60</b> so that when primary door <b>50</b> and secondary door <b>52</b> are in an unlatched condition they may swing freely from an open position to a closed position. (Alternatively, doors <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> each may be in a sliding door arrangement whereby doors <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> slide along a track attached to door frame <b>54</b>, from an open to a closed position.) Latches <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> fix door <b>52</b> from movement when latches <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> are extended and engaged with door frame <b>54</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring again to FIG. 1, mortise lock <b>20</b> includes a base lock member shown as deadbolt <b>22</b>, a latch <b>24</b>, an activation device shown as activation button <b>26</b>, a housing <b>28</b>, a first input device shown as thumbturn handle <b>64</b>, a second input device shown as handle <b>62</b>, an upper secondary lock member shown as upper extension bolt assembly <b>34</b>, and a lower secondary lock member shown as lower extension bolt assembly <b>36</b>. Deadbolt <b>22</b> is actuated by rotation of thumbturn handle <b>64</b> (e.g. an input device). Retraction of latch <b>24</b> into housing <b>28</b> is caused by rotation of handle <b>62</b> (e.g. an input device).</p>
    <p>In operation, secondary door <b>52</b> would be closed, as depicted in FIG. 2, with latches <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> engaged with door frame <b>54</b>. Primary door <b>50</b> is then closed. To cause locking of door <b>50</b>, an operator typically first turns thumbturn handle <b>64</b>, in a counterclockwise direction, as depicted in FIG. 3, thereby extending deadbolt <b>22</b>. Latch <b>24</b> is spring biased to cause latching engagement with secondary door <b>52</b>. Next, an operator causes engagement of extension bolts <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> with door frame <b>54</b>. (Alternatively, door <b>50</b> may have any of a variety of lock members such as extension bolts, latches, hooks, or other suitable locking members to engage door <b>52</b> or door frame <b>54</b>.) Engagement of extension bolts <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> is caused by a counterclockwise rotation of handle <b>62</b>, as depicted in FIG. <b>4</b>. Once latch <b>24</b>, deadbolt <b>22</b>, and extension bolts <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> are engaged, doors <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> are in a fully locked state. Lock <b>20</b> also allows alternative sequences to be used to lock door <b>50</b>. For example, an operator may first turn thumbturn handle <b>64</b>, to extend deadbolt <b>22</b> and then lift handle <b>62</b> to extend extension bolts <b>35</b> and <b>37</b>. Thus, deadbolt <b>22</b> and extension bolts <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> are extendably independent of one another. (Alternatively, the movement of deadbolt <b>22</b> and extension bolts <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> may be dependent on one another.) It should be noted that any lock members (e.g. both extension bolts <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> and deadbolt <b>22</b>) may be any of a variety of types of locking members including, but not limited to flippers, hooks, and other suitable locking members (having any of a variety of locking actions, e.g. directions, orientations). For example, extension bolts may be configured to move laterally or horizontally and may be configured to engage a door or a door frame.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 5, mortise door lock unit <b>20</b> is depicted in the door open state, with latch <b>24</b> extended and activation button <b>26</b> also extended. Because activation button <b>26</b> is extended, both deadbolt <b>22</b> and extension bolt assemblies <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> cannot be extended. (Alternatively, activation button <b>26</b> may be configured to prevent movement or engagement of only one of deadbolt <b>22</b> and extension bolt assemblies <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>.) Deadbolt <b>22</b> is actuated by rotation of thumbturn <b>32</b>, thumbturn <b>32</b> being coupled to thumbturn handle <b>64</b> (depicted in FIG. <b>1</b>). The extension of latch <b>24</b> is caused by a latch biasing spring <b>38</b>. Therefore, latch biasing spring <b>38</b> causes latch <b>24</b> to be extended while a drive <b>30</b> (drive <b>30</b> is coupled to handle <b>62</b>, as depicted in FIG. 1) is not being rotated in the clockwise direction. It should be noted that both drive <b>30</b> and thumbturn <b>32</b> extend through both sides of mortise unit <b>20</b> (see FIGS. <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>). Therefore, rotational directions are reversed if operated from the opposing side. In a preferred embodiment, thumbturn <b>32</b> is coupled to a thumbturn handle <b>64</b> as depicted in FIGS. 1-4 on one side of the door and is coupled to a keyway on the opposite side of the door such that a key must be used to turn thumbturn <b>32</b>. (Alternatively, keyways are interchangeable with thumbturn handle <b>64</b> and handle <b>62</b>; also, thumbturn handle <b>64</b> may be any suitable handle and handle <b>62</b> may be a thumbturn handle or any other suitable handle.)</p>
    <p>Latch <b>24</b> is preferably made from a polymeric material such as a plastic resin (e.g., DELRIN polyester resin or other polymers or composites) to provide a quieter latching action when latch <b>24</b> engages a strike plate situated on the edge of an opposing door or door frame. (Alternatively, latch <b>24</b> may be made from a metal or metal alloy and the strike plate may be made from a polymeric or metallic material.) The application of a plastic latch may also produce less wear on a strike plate. (According to a preferred embodiment, most of the components of the door lock assembly are made from metallic materials such as steel, and steel alloys, however is may be preferable to manufacture some of the components from polymeric materials and polymer composite materials to provide ease of manufacturing, lower manufacturing costs, required strength properties, required flexibility properties, and other desired properties.) As drive <b>30</b> is rotated clockwise to unlatch or retract latch <b>24</b>, a drive spring <b>44</b> causes an opposing torque that returns an input arm <b>42</b> to a nominal position, as depicted in FIG. 5, after the latch retracting torque is released from drive <b>30</b>. Further, during the latching action, a strike plate attached to a second door or a door frame, causes latch <b>24</b> to retract into housing <b>28</b>. Latch <b>24</b> is then forced into an aperture in the strike plate by a latch biasing spring <b>38</b>.</p>
    <p>Drive unit <b>30</b> is also used to extend upper extension bolt base assembly <b>34</b> and lower extension bolt base assembly <b>36</b>. In one embodiment of the present invention extension bolt base assembly <b>34</b> is attached to an extension bolt <b>35</b> as depicted in FIGS. 1-4. Lower extension bolt base <b>36</b> is likewise coupled to an extension bolt <b>37</b>.</p>
    <p>In an alternative embodiment, thumbturn <b>32</b> may actuate both the extension bolt bases <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> as well as deadbolt <b>22</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring again to FIG. 5, mortise door lock unit <b>20</b> is depicted as with the door open position such that everything (e.g. all lock members) is in the fully unlocked position. Furthermore, activation button <b>26</b> is extended thereby preventing the extension of deadbolt <b>22</b> and extension bolt assemblies <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>. Alternatively, activation button <b>26</b> may be configured to prevent movement of any combination of extension bolt base assemblies <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>, handle <b>62</b>, thumbturn <b>32</b>, or deadbolt <b>22</b>. Activation button <b>26</b> is free to move within an activation button housing <b>72</b>. As activation button <b>26</b> is depressed into housing <b>28</b>, activation button <b>26</b> moves into activation button housing <b>72</b> where it engages a push rod <b>74</b>. (According to an alternative embodiment, activation button <b>26</b>, activation button housing <b>72</b>, and push rod <b>74</b> may be combined into a single integrated activation device.) As depicted in FIGS. 9 and 10, push rod <b>74</b> has a stop <b>76</b>, extending therefrom, that is slidably engaged with a slot <b>78</b> on a slide plate <b>91</b>. Therefore, as depicted in FIGS. 5 and 9 the interaction between stop <b>76</b> and slot <b>78</b> when activation button <b>26</b> is extended prevents slide plate <b>91</b> from substantially moving in the vertical direction. As activation button <b>26</b> is depressed, and push rod <b>74</b> causes stop <b>76</b> to slide out of slot <b>78</b>, slide plate <b>91</b> will be freed for movement in the vertical direction. Therefore, it is possible to operate extension bolt assemblies <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> independent of the operation of deadbolt <b>22</b>.</p>
    <p>During normal operation, door <b>50</b> closes and latch <b>24</b> is extended into an opposing door or door frame, thereby latching door <b>50</b> in a closed position. When door <b>50</b> is in a closed position, activation button <b>26</b> engages the strike plate on the opposing door or door frame and is thereby depressed into housing <b>28</b>. If an operator chooses to open door <b>50</b>, handle <b>64</b> is rotated in the clockwise direction. Clockwise rotation of handle <b>64</b> rotates drive <b>30</b> in the clockwise direction causing a first end <b>40</b> of input arm <b>42</b> to engage latch stop <b>43</b>, as depicted in FIG. 6, thereby pulling latch <b>24</b> into housing <b>28</b>, as shown by arrow <b>25</b> in FIG. <b>6</b>. (Alternatively, latch <b>24</b> may be configured to be actuated by thumbturn <b>32</b>.) FIG. 6 depicts mortise lock unit <b>20</b> when door <b>50</b> is in the closed and unlocked position and drive unit <b>30</b> is turned to unlatch door <b>50</b> from door <b>52</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5 depicts deadbolt <b>22</b> in the retracted state, that is deadbolt <b>22</b> is retracted into housing <b>28</b>. In the position depicted in FIG. 5, deadbolt <b>22</b> is in a held position; that is an operator attempting to turn thumbturn <b>32</b> in order to cause deadbolt <b>22</b> to be extended is prevented from turning thumbturn <b>32</b> unless activation button <b>26</b> is depressed. Thumbturn handle <b>64</b>, depicted in FIGS. 1-4, causes deadbolt <b>22</b> to be extended when thumbturn handle <b>64</b> is rotated in the counterclockwise direction. Thumbturn handle <b>64</b> is coupled to thumbturn <b>32</b>. Consistent therewith, deadbolt <b>22</b> is retracted when thumbturn handle <b>64</b> is turned in the clockwise direction. As depicted in FIG. 5, thumbturn <b>32</b> is coupled to a thumbturn link <b>66</b>. Thumbturn link <b>66</b> is designed to provide an extended moment arm for thumbturn <b>32</b> and to engage a thumbturn stop <b>68</b> at a thumbturn link engagement site <b>70</b>. Alternatively, any number of suitable mechanisms may be used to provide movement to deadbolt <b>22</b>, including, for example a system of gears or a system of links and gears.</p>
    <p>As depicted in FIG. 5, thumbturn stop <b>68</b> prevents thumbturn <b>32</b> from being rotated in a counterclockwise direction to extend deadbolt <b>22</b>. (Thumbturn stop <b>68</b> is but one exemplary embodiment of a stop mechanism that prevents deadbolt <b>22</b> from being extended; according to alternative embodiments, any number of alternative mechanisms may be employed to provide the function of thumbturn stop <b>68</b>.) Therefore, to extend deadbolt <b>22</b>, activation button <b>26</b> must first be depressed. As activation button <b>26</b> is depressed into housing <b>28</b>, activation button <b>26</b> moves into activation button housing <b>72</b> where it engages a push rod <b>74</b>. (Activation button <b>26</b> should not be considered limited to the “button” configuration disclosed, as other devices, mechanisms or linkages could be used to provide the function of activation button <b>26</b>.) Push rod <b>74</b> has a pin <b>76</b> extending therefrom that is slidably engaged with a slot <b>78</b>. As activation button <b>26</b> is depressed and push rod <b>74</b> causes pin <b>76</b> to ride in slot <b>78</b>, thumbturn stop <b>68</b> is caused to move in a downward direction perpendicular to the direction of movement of push rod <b>74</b>. Thumbturn stop <b>68</b> is constrained to move by a stop guide <b>69</b>, as depicted in FIGS. 5, <b>9</b>, and <b>11</b>. (Alternatively, thumbturn stop <b>68</b> could be constrained by a pin, a series of pins, constrained to rotate about an axis, or constrained to move in any number of suitable ways.) Stop guide <b>69</b> is constrained to move in a slot <b>71</b> in housing <b>28</b>, depicted in FIGS. 9, <b>11</b>, and <b>22</b>. Slot <b>71</b> and stop guide <b>69</b> constrains thumbturn stop <b>68</b> to move linearly in the direction shown by arrow <b>73</b> in FIG. <b>11</b>. When thumbturn stop <b>68</b> has fully moved downward in the vertical direction, as constrained by the engagement of pin <b>76</b> and slot <b>78</b> and stop guide <b>69</b> and slot <b>71</b>, thumbturn engagement extension <b>70</b> is released from engagement with thumbturn stop <b>68</b>. (Alternatively, thumbturn stop <b>68</b> may be a variety of mechanisms including but not limited to a link that is rotatably mounted and actuated through coaction with activation button <b>26</b>.) Therefore, thumbturn <b>32</b> may be rotated in the counterclockwise direction to extend deadbolt <b>22</b>. Thumbturn link <b>66</b> is rotatably coupled with a second thumbturn link <b>80</b>, that is rotatably coupled with deadbolt <b>22</b>. Deadbolt <b>22</b> is constrained to move in a linear direction by pin guide <b>82</b>. Pin guide <b>82</b> has a pin extending through pin guide <b>82</b> that rides in a slot <b>83</b>.</p>
    <p>As will be recognized, if deadbolt <b>22</b> is extended while door <b>52</b> is closed and door <b>50</b> is open, and door <b>50</b> is subsequently closed, deadbolt <b>22</b> will contact door <b>52</b> thereby causing damage to door <b>52</b> (or to the frame in a single-door application). It is thus important to note that because activation button <b>26</b> must be depressed before deadbolt <b>22</b> may be extended, deadbolt <b>22</b> may be extended only under certain conditions, for example, when the door is in a closed position and activation button <b>26</b> is depressed by the abutting second door or door frame or, when activation button <b>26</b> is intentionally depressed by an operator. Therefore, the utilization of activation button <b>26</b> helps prevent closure (i.e. accidental slamming) of an “open” door, such as the type shown by door <b>50</b>, as depicted in FIGS. 1-4, when deadbolt <b>22</b> is extended.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, it is important to note that extension of deadbolt <b>22</b> and extension assemblies <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> are independent of one another, providing an operator with full selectivity of extending the base lock member or the secondary lock members. In other words, deadbolt <b>22</b> may be extended (fully) while extension assemblies <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> are retracted, or extension assemblies <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> may be fully extended while deadbolt <b>22</b> is retracted.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 6, mortise lock unit <b>20</b> is depicted in the door closed position having deadbolt <b>22</b> and extension bolt assemblies <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> in the unlocked state, and having latch <b>24</b> retracted. As depicted by directional arrow <b>31</b>, drive unit <b>30</b> is rotated in the clockwise position to engage first end <b>40</b> of input arm <b>42</b> with latch stop <b>43</b>. As depicted, drive <b>30</b> is rotated so that first end <b>40</b> engages latch stop <b>43</b> causing latch <b>24</b> to move in the horizontal direction as depicted by directional arrow <b>25</b>. Also, as drive <b>30</b> is rotated in the clockwise direction, drive spring <b>44</b> flexes which tends to put a counterclockwise torque on drive <b>30</b> so that when an operator induced torque is released from drive <b>30</b>, input arm <b>42</b> returns to the nominal position, depicted in FIG. <b>5</b>. Further, as latch <b>24</b> moves in the direction of arrow <b>25</b>, latch spring <b>38</b> is caused to flex thereby storing potential energy which is used to return latch <b>24</b> to an extended position (shown in phantom lines).</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 7, mortise lock unit <b>20</b> is depicted in a door closed position having deadbolt <b>22</b> extended and having extension bolt assemblies <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> in an unlocked or retracted state. In the position depicted in FIG. 7, deadbolt <b>22</b> may be freely locked and unlocked by turning thumbturn <b>32</b>. Furthermore, latch <b>24</b> may be freely retracted by rotating drive <b>30</b> in a clockwise direction. Because activation button <b>26</b> is depressed, extension bolt assemblies <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> are also free to move by rotation of drive unit <b>30</b> in the counterclockwise direction. As drive <b>30</b> is rotated in the counterclockwise direction input arm <b>42</b> engages a pin <b>84</b> that extends from slide plate <b>91</b>. The force of input arm <b>42</b> on pin <b>84</b> causes slide plate <b>91</b> to move in the vertical downward direction (as indicated by arrow <b>93</b> depicted in FIG. <b>8</b>). As depicted in FIG. 8, downward movement of slide plate <b>91</b> causes a pinion gear <b>95</b> to rotate in the counterclockwise direction as indicated by arrow <b>97</b>. As pinion gear <b>95</b> rotates in the clockwise direction, an upper slide plate <b>94</b> is caused to move in the vertical upward direction indicated by arrow <b>99</b>, thereby reversing the motion supplied by plate <b>91</b>. (Alternatively, other motion-reversing devices, mechanisms or linkages may be used, such as a suitably configured series of gears, links, or levers, or any other suitable combination of mechanical elements.) When slide plate <b>91</b> has moved to the fully locked position, as depicted in FIG. 8, pin <b>82</b> moves into a slot <b>45</b> on slide plate <b>91</b>. (Although slide plate <b>91</b> is depicted as a sliding plate, other mechanisms, such as rotating mechanisms, or latching mechanisms, etc. may be used to coact with drive <b>30</b> to cause movement of the extension bolt or extension members.) FIG. 15 also depicts a partial cross sectional cut away view of pin <b>82</b>, showing pin <b>82</b> engaged in slot <b>45</b> of slide plate <b>91</b>. Furthermore, FIG. 14 provides a cross sectional view of mortise lock unit <b>20</b>, showing pin <b>82</b> sliding in a slot <b>47</b> of deadbolt <b>22</b>. FIG. 14 also shows pin <b>82</b> to be slidable within lock unit <b>20</b>, pin <b>82</b> riding in a slot <b>27</b> provided in housing <b>28</b>. (The location of slot <b>27</b> and housing <b>28</b> can also be seen in FIG. <b>24</b>). As depicted in FIGS. 1-4, extension bolt assemblies <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> are concealed within door <b>50</b>. Extension bolt assemblies <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> extend through channels interior to door <b>50</b> through which extension bolts <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> are freely moveable. To extend extension bolts <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>, extension bolt bases <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> must be extended therewith. Further, to extend extension bolt bases <b>46</b> and <b>48</b>, drive <b>30</b> must be rotated in a counterclockwise direction by using handle <b>62</b> as discussed above.</p>
    <p>When activation button <b>26</b> is extended and extension bolt bases <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> are retracted, a stop <b>76</b> (depicted in FIGS. 9, <b>10</b>, and <b>21</b>) on push rod <b>74</b> prevents lower slide plate <b>91</b> from any substantial movement, and therefore prevents extension bolt bases <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> from extending through housing <b>28</b>. When activation button <b>26</b> is extended and extension bolt assemblies <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> are retracted, a counterclockwise rotation to drive <b>30</b> will not extend extension bolt bases <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> because stop <b>76</b> engages a groove <b>78</b> in lower slide plate <b>91</b> thereby preventing any linear upward or downward movement. If extension bolt assemblies <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> were allowed to move freely without depression of activation button <b>26</b>, potential damage to door frame <b>54</b> or wood work surrounding doors <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> could result as shutting door <b>50</b> could cause extension bolts <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> to contact door frame <b>54</b> and cause damage. For example, as depicted in FIGS. 1-4, if door <b>52</b> is closed and door <b>50</b> is in the open position, and extension bolts <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> were extended, closure of door <b>50</b> may cause extension bolts <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> to slam into door frame <b>54</b> possibly causing damage to any wood work surrounding door frame <b>54</b> (or the locking system). Therefore, activation button <b>26</b> is to be depressed before extension bolts <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> may be extended. When activation button <b>26</b> is depressed, stop <b>76</b> moves out of slot <b>78</b> and slider plate <b>91</b> is allowed to move freely along with slider plate <b>94</b>. (Closure of door <b>50</b> causes activation button <b>26</b> to be depressed by engagement with door <b>52</b>.) With door <b>50</b> in this closed position, engagement of extension bolts <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> will more firmly secure door <b>50</b> in door frame <b>54</b>.</p>
    <p>In many conventional multi-point door lock systems, operation is not “intuitive” as to the extension bolts and the deadbolt, because the deadbolt is typically coupled to the extension bolt mechanism such that the deadbolt is extended if and only if the extension bolts are extended. According to any preferred embodiment of the present invention, the extension of deadbolt <b>22</b> is independent of the extension of extension bolts <b>35</b> and <b>37</b>. Therefore, an operator may choose to extend either deadbolt <b>22</b> or extension bolts <b>35</b> and <b>37</b>. Thus, when an operator does not understand how to extend extension bolts <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> for optimum security, deadbolt <b>22</b> may still be extended by the intuitive operation of thumbturn handle <b>64</b>, when activation button <b>26</b> is depressed.</p>
    <p>To extend deadbolt <b>22</b> without extending extension bolts <b>35</b> and <b>37</b>, an operator first closes door <b>50</b>. If door <b>52</b> is already closed, activation button <b>26</b> engages door <b>52</b>, the engagement depresses activation button <b>26</b> into housing <b>28</b>. As activation button <b>26</b> is depressed, rod <b>74</b> pushes pin <b>76</b> to ride in slot <b>78</b>. As pin <b>76</b> rides in slot <b>78</b>, thumbturn stop <b>68</b> moves in the vertical direction thereby freeing thumbturn link <b>66</b> along thumbturn <b>32</b> to be rotated and thereby extending deadbolt <b>22</b> as earlier described.</p>
    <p>Once multi-point door lock unit <b>20</b> is in the fully locked position, as depicted in FIG. 8, the door <b>50</b> may not be unlocked until deadbolt <b>22</b> is first unlocked. In other words, a user is prevented from retracting extension bolt assemblies <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> or latch <b>24</b> until deadbolt <b>22</b> is first retracted. Pin <b>82</b> that rides in slot <b>83</b> of deadbolt <b>22</b> also sits in a slot <b>45</b> of slide plate <b>91</b> thereby preventing slide plate <b>91</b> from moving in the vertical direction. If slide plate <b>91</b> is prevented from moving in the vertical direction, extension bolt assemblies <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> are also prevented from moving. Furthermore, if slide plate <b>91</b> is prevented from moving, input arm <b>42</b> is prevented from engaging latch stop <b>43</b> because a pin <b>71</b> prevents end <b>40</b> of input arm <b>42</b> from engaging latch stop <b>43</b>. A biasing spring <b>23</b> retains pin <b>82</b> within slot <b>45</b> of slide plate <b>91</b>.</p>
    <p>To unlock door <b>50</b>, an operator first turns thumbturn <b>32</b> in a clockwise direction. As deadbolt <b>22</b> is retracted into housing <b>28</b>, end <b>47</b> of slot <b>45</b> engages pin <b>82</b> as depicted in FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>12</b>-<b>14</b> and thereby moves pin <b>82</b> out of slot <b>45</b>. In such a position, slide plate <b>91</b> is freed to move. Therefore, clockwise rotation of drive <b>30</b> causes input arm <b>42</b> to engage pin <b>71</b>. This engagement drives slide plate <b>91</b> in the vertical upwards direction causing pinion <b>95</b> to rotate in the counterclockwise direction thereby driving slide plate <b>94</b> in the vertical downwards direction. Thus, extension bolt assemblies <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> are retracted into housing <b>28</b> thereby unlocking door <b>50</b>. As input arm <b>42</b> drives slide plate <b>91</b> in the vertical upward direction, end <b>40</b> of input arm <b>42</b> engages latch stop <b>43</b> thereby causing retraction of latch <b>24</b> into housing <b>28</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring again to FIGS. 1-4, it should be noted that it may be preferable to have door lock <b>20</b> mounted in door <b>52</b> as opposed to door <b>50</b>. If it is desired to mount door lock <b>20</b> in door <b>52</b>, it would be necessary to install latch <b>24</b> (which has a “flat” face or surface and a diagonal face or surface) with its diagonal face turned in the opposite direction compared to the position of door lock <b>20</b> when installed in door <b>50</b>, as depicted in FIGS. 1-4 (so that it is readily guided into its receptacle in the other door or frame but yet may firmly hold against a pulling force once the door is closed).</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 16, diagonal surface <b>25</b> of latch <b>24</b> is depicted. It may be preferable to install latch <b>24</b> with diagonal surface <b>25</b> facing in the opposite direction, as shown in phantom lines (that is to have latch <b>24</b> rotated 180 degrees about an axis that is perpendicular to a face plate <b>100</b>). FIG. 17 depicts latch <b>24</b> in the position shown in FIG. 16. A latch retainer <b>102</b> guides latch <b>24</b> to slide in a linear horizontal direction. Latch retainer <b>102</b> is retained in its guiding position, depicted in FIG. 17, by a biasing spring <b>103</b> and a pin <b>104</b>.</p>
    <p>To reorient (or “reverse”) latch <b>24</b>, an operator inserts a tool <b>106</b>, such as a screwdriver or other suitable tool, into a slot <b>105</b>. The operator then lifts tool <b>106</b> to rotate latch retainer <b>102</b> in a direction depicted in FIG. 18 by arrow <b>108</b>. Once retainer <b>102</b> is in the released position depicted in FIG. 18, latch <b>24</b> may be extended out of housing <b>28</b> in a direction shown by arrow <b>110</b> in FIG. <b>20</b>. Once latch <b>24</b> is extended as depicted in FIG. 20, latch <b>24</b> can be rotated as depicted by arrow <b>112</b> in FIG. <b>19</b>. The rotation of latch <b>24</b> reorients diagonal surface <b>25</b> into an alternative position as depicted in FIG. 16, in phantom. After latch <b>24</b> is rotated and reoriented in the desired position, latch <b>24</b> is reinserted into housing <b>28</b> in a direction opposite arrow <b>110</b> until latch stop <b>43</b> passes end <b>114</b> of latch retainer <b>102</b>. Retaining spring <b>103</b> and release from tool <b>106</b>, causes retainer <b>102</b> to return to its initial position, depicted in FIG. <b>17</b>. As depicted in FIG. 22, retainer <b>102</b> can be accessed through slot <b>105</b> which is located on one side of the door lock unit <b>20</b>. (According to an alternative embodiment, an access hole could be placed in an alternative position on housing <b>28</b> such that a tool, such as tool <b>106</b> could be used to access and manipulate the position of retainer <b>102</b>, that is to release retainer <b>102</b> from its initial position on pin <b>104</b>; furthermore, other latch reorienting mechanisms may be applied without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.)</p>
    <p>According to a preferred embodiment, multi-point door lock <b>20</b> is reconfigurable and modular and the extension bolts may be installed to extend through the interior of the door, as depicted in FIGS. 1-4; in an alternative embodiment the extension bolts may be installed to extend along an edge <b>200</b> of a door <b>250</b>, as depicted in FIGS. 25, <b>26</b>, and <b>28</b>. As depicted in FIGS. 25 and 26, an extension bolt base <b>210</b> extends through a top slot <b>212</b> in housing <b>28</b>. Similarly, an extension bolt base <b>214</b> extends through a bottom slot <b>216</b> in housing <b>28</b>. Extension bolt base <b>210</b> is coupled to slide plate <b>294</b> which is actuated by drive <b>30</b>. Similarly, extension bolt base <b>214</b> is coupled to slide plate <b>291</b> which is also actuated by drive <b>30</b>. As drive <b>30</b> is turned in the counterclockwise direction, extension bolt bases <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> are extended from housing <b>28</b>, as depicted in FIG. <b>26</b>.</p>
    <p>As depicted in FIGS. 28 and 29, extension bolt bases <b>210</b> and <b>214</b> are coupled to extension assemblies <b>218</b> and <b>220</b> respectively by pins <b>222</b> and <b>224</b> respectively. A series of spacer guides <b>226</b> have columnar pins <b>227</b>, running therethrough; the spacer guides <b>226</b> ride in elongated slots <b>228</b>. (Columnar pins <b>222</b> may be provided by, for example, appropriate fasteners such as but not limited to bolts, rivets, nails, or screws.)</p>
    <p>Extension assemblies <b>218</b> and <b>220</b> are coupled to extension bolts <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> respectively. Extension bolts <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> extend into the door frame to securely latch door <b>250</b> to a door frame, such as door frame <b>54</b> as depicted in FIGS. 1-4. FIG. 27 depicts face plate system <b>200</b> having a face plate <b>202</b>. Face plate <b>202</b> runs along the edge <b>201</b> of door <b>250</b>.</p>
    <p>To install face plate system <b>200</b> on a door such as door <b>250</b>, an operator would form a mortise hole in door <b>250</b> having a size and shape that would accommodate insertion of mortise unit <b>20</b> therein. Also, an operator would provide a routed groove along edge <b>201</b> of door <b>250</b> that would accommodate the face plate system <b>200</b> such that face plate <b>202</b> would reside substantially flush with edge <b>201</b> of door <b>250</b>. When face plate assembly <b>200</b> is properly positioned, a plurality of pins <b>227</b> (or suitable fasteners) may be used to affix assembly <b>200</b> to edge <b>201</b> of door <b>250</b>. Pins <b>227</b> would extend into edge <b>201</b> of door <b>250</b> to fasten assembly <b>200</b> thereto.</p>
    <p>It should be noted that extension assemblies <b>218</b> and <b>220</b> may be provided in a variety of lengths to accommodate different door sizes. Further, it should also be noted that a variety of extension bolts <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> may be attached to the ends of extension assembly <b>218</b> and <b>200</b> to provide customized output suitable for the application. For example, extension bolts <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> may be replaced by extension hooks or other locking elements or mechanisms.</p>
    <p>According to a particularly preferred embodiment, deadbolt <b>22</b> and extension bolts <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> or extension bolts <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> will extend linearly a distance of approximately one inch or more (or other shorter distances if needed in alternative embodiments). Multi-point door lock <b>20</b> allows extension of the extension bolts <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> or <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> and the deadbolt <b>22</b> to be at least one inch or more; because of the length of input arm <b>42</b> that engages pin <b>88</b>, extension bolt base <b>36</b> is caused to move a distance of at least one inch or more. As slide plate <b>91</b> or <b>291</b> is moved downwardly by input arm <b>42</b> engaging pin <b>88</b>, slide plate <b>91</b> or <b>291</b> has teeth that engage a pinion wheel <b>92</b>. Downward movement of slide plate <b>91</b> or <b>291</b> causes pinion wheel <b>92</b> to rotate in a clockwise direction. The teeth on pinion wheel <b>92</b> engage second slide plate <b>94</b> or <b>294</b> which moves upwardly along with upper extension bolt base <b>34</b>. Upper extension bolt base <b>34</b> runs along a guide <b>35</b> to provide linear movement. According to a preferred embodiment, both upper bolt base <b>34</b> and lower bolt base <b>36</b> move linearly approximately one inch or more in opposite directions as caused by the reversing mechanism, pinion gear <b>92</b>.</p>
    <p>As depicted in FIGS. 1-4, handle <b>62</b> actuates drive unit <b>30</b>. In a preferred embodiment, handle <b>62</b> is designed to rotate approximately 30 degrees in each direction and preferably less than 45 degrees, to cause extension of extension bolts <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> or <b>230</b> and <b>232</b>. When extension bolts <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> or <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> have been extended, pin <b>71</b>, depicted in FIG. 8, rests against input arm <b>42</b> thereby providing the user with a positive-locked feel via drive unit <b>30</b> and handle <b>62</b>. For example, with extension bolts locked, a user providing a clockwise rotation to handle <b>62</b> will feel resistance from pin <b>71</b>, the resistance to movement caused by pin <b>82</b> riding in slot <b>45</b>, thereby indicating to the user that the extension bolts are extended. If the extension bolts are not extended and deadbolt <b>22</b> is extended, pin <b>71</b> is in the position as depicted in FIG. <b>7</b> and input arm <b>42</b> is not constrained to rotate in the clockwise direction, thereby indicating that the extension bolts are not extended. When extension bolts <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> or <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> are extended, clockwise rotation of drive <b>30</b> causes input arm <b>42</b> to engage pin <b>71</b> thereby causing retraction of extension bolts <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> or <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> simultaneously, arm <b>40</b> engages latch stop <b>43</b> thereby simultaneously causing latch <b>24</b> to retract into housing <b>28</b>. Therefore, if deadbolt <b>22</b> has already been retracted into housing <b>28</b> by rotating thumbturn <b>32</b> in the clockwise direction, doors <b>50</b> or <b>250</b> will be free to swing open.</p>
    <p>In an alternative embodiment, depicted in FIGS. 30-32, a passive door lock <b>300</b> may be used to cooperate with multi-point door lock <b>20</b>, as described above. As shown in FIG. 30, multi-point door lock <b>20</b> is embedded in an active door (such as active door <b>50</b>, as depicted in FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b>). Passive door lock <b>300</b> is embedded in a passive door <b>352</b> (door <b>352</b> being similar to door <b>52</b> depicted in FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b>). Passive door lock <b>300</b> has a housing <b>328</b>, a deadbolt aperture <b>322</b> in housing <b>328</b>, a latch aperture <b>324</b> in housing <b>328</b>, a drive <b>330</b>, an input arm <b>342</b>, a slide plate <b>391</b>, and a slide plate <b>394</b>. FIG. 30 depicts passive lock <b>300</b> having extension bolt bases <b>346</b> and <b>348</b> in a retracted position. Extension bolt bases <b>346</b> and <b>348</b> are configured to be coupled to a set of extension bolt assemblies, the extension bolt assemblies extending through the door and out of the top edge of the door, to lock up and hold door <b>352</b> in a locked position, when extension bolt bases <b>346</b> and <b>348</b> are extended. In an alternative embodiment, extension bolt assemblies may be coupled to slide plates <b>391</b> and <b>394</b> at positions <b>392</b> and <b>393</b> respectively, similar to the extension bolt assemblies depicted in FIGS. 25 and 26.</p>
    <p>As depicted in FIG. 31, passive lock <b>300</b> has a blocker pin <b>340</b> that interferes with the movement of deadbolt <b>22</b> through deadbolt aperture <b>322</b>, when passive lock <b>300</b> is in a retracted position.</p>
    <p>If drive <b>330</b> is rotated in the counterclockwise direction, input arm <b>342</b> engages a pin <b>384</b>, causing extension bolt bases <b>346</b> and <b>348</b> to be extended to the position shown in FIG. <b>32</b>. As slide plate <b>394</b> moves in the upward direction, so does blocking pin <b>340</b> such that when extension bolt bases <b>346</b> and <b>348</b> are in a fully extended position, deadbolt <b>22</b> is not restricted from moving through deadbolt aperture <b>322</b> and into housing <b>328</b>, as depicted in FIG. <b>32</b>. (Other types of lock members may be employed according to alternative embodiments.)</p>
    <p>Passive lock <b>300</b> therefore requires that the passive door first be placed in a locked state before allowing the active door to be locked using deadbolt <b>22</b>. This prevents passive door <b>352</b> from being unlocked and an operator locking deadbolt <b>22</b>, whereby forcible entry may be obtained by pulling open both the active and passive doors simultaneously.</p>
    <p>Lock <b>20</b> (in any preferred or alternative embodiment) may be applied to a variety of configurations, all within the spirit and scope of the present invention. These configurations include, lock <b>20</b> in an active door installed in a frame, lock <b>20</b> in an active door in a frame with a passive door in a frame, and lock <b>20</b> in an active door in a frame with a passive door in a frame with a passive lock.</p>
    <p>According to alternative embodiments of the present invention, a variety of passive locks may be applied without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. These passive locks may include passive locks that are automatically triggered by locking of the primary door, locks having different extension assembly arrangements, and locks having different locking mechanisms.</p>
    <p>According to further alternative embodiments of the present invention, door lock <b>20</b> may be embodied without activation button <b>26</b> (while still retaining all of the structure functionality that does not depend on activation button <b>26</b>), without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention; furthermore, activation button <b>26</b> may be viewed as a selectively removable device, without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
    <p>Although only a few exemplary embodiments of this invention have been described in detail above, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible in the exemplary embodiments without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of this invention. For example, various input devices and/or different handle configurations may be coupled to the door lock, various alternative mechanisms may be used to provide locking action, different extension bolt and/or deadbolt configurations or hooks or latches may be used, members and elements may be coupled (or may co-act) directly or indirectly (e.g. through other intermediate links or structures), and the door lock may be applied to different door arrangements or configurations. Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the invention as defined in the following claims. Furthermore, a variety of mechanisms may be applied to carry out the functions of the door lock. Although members and elements may be shown as directly or indirectly coupled in the exemplary embodiments, the present invention should not be considered to be limited to such couplings (e.g. such couplings may be direct or indirect) within the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
    <p>The method of operation of the lock according to preferred and alternative embodiments may be performed in various steps; any omissions or additions of steps to those steps disclosed, or any departure from the order or sequence of steps recited, should be considered to fit within the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
    <p>In the claims, each means-plus-function clause is intended to cover the structures described herein as performing the recited function and not only structural equivalents but also equivalent structures.</p>
    <p>Other substitutions, modifications, changes, and omissions may be made in the design, size or proportion, operating conditions, and arrangement of the preferred embodiments without departing from the spirit of the invention as described in the appended claims.</p>
