    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>The present invention relates to a hand tool, more particularly to a clamp having a clamping wire set for extending the distance between the handle and the working end of the tool, so that the working end can be extended into the engine chamber of a car or a small narrow space of other machineries for the application of the tool.</p>
    <p>2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p>Various tools such as clamps, wrenches, and the like are used for repairing machineries, and there are lots of wirings and components in the interior of ordinary machines or car engine chamber. Therefore, there are limitations for using ordinary tools in such a limited working space, not only staining the sleeve or clothes by dirty grease, but also having the risk of hurting the user's hand by the mechanical components. Furthermore, some of the repairing position is beyond the reach by the user's hands or hand tools. Therefore, the parts other than those requiring repair are removed first before repairing, and reinstall those parts after the repair is completed. In some cases, we have to disassemble and then assemble the whole set of machine for replacing or adjusting a small part, not only wasting efforts but also wasting lots of time.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a clamp assembly that can be extended into an engine chamber of a car or a small narrow space of other machineries for the application of the tool. The clamp assembly of the present invention can use a clipping member to clip a workpiece, or uses a poling member to poke the objects around the repairing workpiece, which offers a convenient, handy, easy, and convenient way for the repair.</p>
    <p>Another objective of the present invention is to provide a clamp assembly that allows users to replace or install the clipping member or poking member on the same clamp handle.</p>
    <p>A further objective of the present invention is to provide a clamp assembly having a replaceable clipping member and poking member, so that any single component of the clipping member or the poking member can be replaced when it is damaged. The structural design of the present invention enables users to replace such component quickly and easily.</p>
    <p>To accomplish the foregoing objectives, the present invention comprises a pair of clamp handles, wherein one clamp handle has a sliding track, and said sliding track is pivotally couple to a corner of a clamp wire control plate, and both ends of said clamp wire control plate individually coupled to a clamp wire fixing member and pivotally coupled to another clamp handle; a pair of clamp heads are stacked and pivotally coupled with each other, and their rear ends are couple with said clamp handles. A clamp handle torque spring is disposed on one of the clamp head, and a clamp control plate is disposed on another clamp head, and the clamp control plate and the clamp head having a clamp handle torque spring at their corresponding edges each has a ratcheted edge and a ratcheted section engaged with each other. The rear end of the clamp control plate is a poking plate, and the ratcheted edge and ratcheted serration will be separated by pressing the poking plate, and the clamp wire fixing member is coupled with the rear end of the central linear member of a clamp wire set, and the central linear member passes through a protective tube, and its front end is coupled to a clipping member or a poking member. Controlling the extension or contraction of the central linear member of the clamp wire set produces an axial movement and further controls such clipping member or poking member to clip the workpiece or poke the objects around the workpiece.</p>

    <p>a first L-shaped poking member <b>92</b>, having a fixing hole <b>921</b> for enabling the fixing head <b>712</b> of said central linear member <b>71</b> to pass through and be latched in a fixed position; a space <b>922</b> being defined at the upper section of said first L-shaped clipping member <b>92</b>;</p>
    <p>a second L-shaped poking member <b>93</b>, comprising an extended upper plate structure passing through the space <b>922</b> of the first poking member <b>92</b>, and one end of said L-shaped poking member <b>93</b> being fixed to the upper section of said fixing plate <b>91</b> by a fixture <b>931</b>;</p>
    <p>a spring <b>94</b>, disposed between said first and first poking members <b>92</b>, and the fixing plate <b>91</b> outside said central linear member <b>71</b>.</p>
    <p>After knowing the structure of the present invention, we will further describe the operation and movement of the present invention as follows:</p>
    <p>The user generally operates the first and second clamp handles <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> to attain the purpose of controlling the opening of the clipping member <b>80</b> or the poking member <b>90</b>; the clipping member is closed to clip a workpiece and opened to release a workpiece; the poking member is opened to poke the objects surrounding a workpiece.</p>
    <p>In FIG. 5B, the user exerts forces on the first and second clamp handles <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> by gripping them, the ratcheted section <b>43</b> of the second clamp head <b>41</b> and the ratcheted edge <b>63</b> of the clamp control plate <b>60</b> produces a alternate ratchet phenomenon and sound due to the sliding in the positive direction, and the clamp wire control plate <b>30</b> swings towards the second clamp handle <b>11</b> by sing the pivotal member <b>311</b> of its long arm <b>31</b> as a hinge, and such swing converts into a force on the sliding wedge <b>34</b> to drive the corner of the clamp wire control plate <b>30</b> to move towards the end of said sliding hole <b>23</b>, and said clamp wire fixing member also moves back and further pull the central linear member <b>71</b>. The front end of the central linear member <b>71</b> pulls the second clipping member <b>83</b> of the clipping member <b>80</b>, and the first and second clipping members <b>82</b>, <b>83</b> use said sliding space <b>822</b> to produce the corresponding movement and compress the spring <b>84</b> to achieve the control of clipping the workpiece. In FIG. 8B, if the first and second clamp handles <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> work with the poking member <b>90</b>, then the central linear member <b>71</b> is pulled while the first poking plate <b>92</b> is pulled so that the first and second poking plates <b>92</b>, <b>93</b> are separated to achieve the purpose of poking the objects surrounding the workpiece.</p>
    <p>When the clipping member <b>80</b> has clipped the workpiece or the poking member <b>90</b> has poked the object to a predetermined distance, the user can gently grip the first and second clamp handles <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>. Although a tension is exerted on the first and second clamp handles <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, the reaction on the ratchet section <b>43</b> and the ratcheted edge <b>63</b> of the first and second clamp heads <b>40</b>, <b>41</b> is in a latch situation in the opposite direction, therefore the first and second clamp handles <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> will be fixed in a predetermined clamping angle without the risk of spring apart.</p>
    <p>In FIGS. 5A and 8A, if the user wants to release the workpiece from the clipping member <b>80</b> or the object around the workpiece from the poking member <b>90</b>, the user must press the poking plate <b>64</b> of the clamp control plate <b>60</b> in the direction towards the first clamp handle <b>10</b> so that the ratcheted edge and the ratcheted section <b>43</b> are separated, and the first and second clamp handles <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> lose the latching force. The clamp handle torque spring <b>50</b> and the spring <b>84</b>, <b>94</b> of the clipping member <b>80</b> or poking member <b>90</b> also lose the coiling or compression, both restore their positions. Particularly, the spring <b>84</b>, <b>90</b> of the clipping member <b>80</b> or the poking member <b>90</b> restores its position to drive the second clipping member <b>83</b> or the first poking plate <b>92</b> to restore the position such that the clipping member <b>80</b> or the poking member <b>90</b> restores its original opening status while pulling the central linear member <b>71</b> to move forward. The central linear member <b>71</b> also pulls the clamp fixing member <b>35</b> to use the sliding wedge <b>34</b> at its corner to move to the front of the sliding hole <b>23</b> such that the clamp control plate swings outward in the direction towards the first clamp handle <b>10</b>, and the first and second clamp handles <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> will automatically open.</p>
    <p>The present invention uses a clamp wire set <b>70</b> to extend the distance between the handle of the tool to the working end, so that the tool can be extended into a small narrow operating space that the user's hand or regular tools cannot reach. The flexibility of the clamp wire set <b>70</b> allows the tool of the present invention to pass through the curve and turning in the space easily. The user can control the grip of the first and second clamp handles <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> to control the clipping member <b>80</b> to clip the workpiece or the poking member <b>90</b> to poke the objects around the workpiece. The operation is simple and handy. If the user wants to release the workpiece, the user just needs to press the poking plate <b>64</b> to open the first and second clamp handles <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> while restoring the clipping member <b>80</b> or poling member to the original opening status. The operation is also simple, handy, easy and convenient.</p>
    <p>In addition, the clipping member <b>80</b> and poking member <b>90</b> of the present invention can work together with a clamp wire set <b>70</b> and uses the threaded fixture <b>721</b> of the protective sleeve <b>72</b> to couple with the threaded hole <b>4541</b> of the clamp wire plate <b>711</b>, and the threaded fixture <b>711</b> of the central linear member <b>71</b> to couple with the threaded hole <b>351</b> of the clamp wire fixing member <b>35</b> to quickly install the clipping member <b>80</b> or the poking member <b>90</b> on the same clamp handle. The clipping member <b>80</b> and the poking member <b>90</b> are the replaceable components. When a component fails, it can be replaced. For replacing a component, the C-shape latch ring <b>821</b>, <b>911</b> and the fixture <b>831</b>, <b>931</b> are removed to release the coupling of the components, and thus achieving the purpose of replacing components quickly.</p>
    <p>While the present invention has been described in connection with what is considered the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is understood that this invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments but is intended to cover various arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the broadest interpretations and equivalent arrangements.</p>
