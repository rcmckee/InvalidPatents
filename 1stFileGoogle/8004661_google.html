    <heading>RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading> <p num="p-0002">This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/077,083, filed Jun. 30, 2008, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. This application is related to concurrently-filed U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/495,437, the entire disclosure of which is also incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">The present invention relates, in general, to methods and apparatus for sorting cells and, in particular, to methods and apparatus for using a controlled energy source to modify a population of cells of interest by selectively removing, enriching, or altering cells, viruses, or particles from the population.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading> <p num="p-0004">Flow cytometric sorting permits the selection, enrichment, apportionment, or division of populations of cells, viruses, bodies or particles of interest (hereinafter referred to as cells). The selection criteria include measurable properties of individual cells that can be detected from outside the cell, with or without the aid of chemical reagents or of complexes or bodies that are, or that may be caused to be, associated with the cell. For instance, properties of cells may be measured or approximated by detecting and/or quantifying the association of the cells with one or more labels, such as molecules, complexes, or bodies that fluoresce or have been modified to be rendered fluorescent. Such fluorescent molecules, complexes, and/or bodies may differentially associate with cells on the basis of qualitative or quantitative properties of the cells, including their composition with respect to proteins, lipids, phosphoproteins, glycoproteins, phospholipids, glycolipids, nucleic acids (including the quantity, sequence, or organization of nucleic acids), carbohydrates, salts/ions, and any other molecules in, on, or associated with the cells. Further, such fluorescent molecules, complexes, and/or bodies may differentially associate with cells based on physical or physiological characteristics of the cells, examples of which include but are not limited to membrane permeability, membrane composition, membrane fluidity, chemical or membrane potential, viability, chemical gradients, motility, reduction or oxidation potential or state, and other parameters or properties.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">Other measurable properties of cells, whether labeled or unlabelled, modified or unmodified, that may provide a basis for cell selection may include but are not limited to:</p>
    <p num="p-0006">properties of light interacting with the cells, such as fluorescence, absorbance, reflectance, scatter, polarization, or other properties;</p>
    <p num="p-0007">electrical properties of the cells or of the effect of the cells on their environment, including conductance, inductance, resistance, membrane potential or voltage, or other properties;</p>
    <p num="p-0008">magnetic or electromagnetic properties of cells, including magnetism, paramagnetism, magnetic resonance, and/or interaction of the cells with electromagnetic energy;</p>
    <p num="p-0009">the appearance, image, or morphological properties of the cells; and</p>
    <p num="p-0010">the makeup of the cells with respect to any substance or parameter, measured directly or indirectly in any way.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">Furthermore, the measurement of such parameters, directly or indirectly, singularly or in combination, may reflect simple or complex properties of interest of the cells.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">One example of such a property is the sex chromosome included in the diploid, haploid, or gamete genome, which may be an X chromosome or a Y chromosome or combinations of both depending on the cell type and the organism. The determination of sex chromosome content may be inferred using direct or indirect measurements or determinations using one or more methods. Such methods include the measurement of the DNA content of the cells determined relatively or absolutely; the presence or absence of certain DNA sequences, or markers of the presence or absence of certain DNA sequences; the size of the cells or of portions or organelles of the cells; the presence, localization, or absence of proteins or other markers characteristic of the sex chromosome content of the cells, or combinations or patterns of expression of such markers; or any other measurement that reflects the sex chromosome composition of the cell. Many other such measurements may be made, or properties determined, to identify cells that are of interest in a particular instance, situation, system, disease, condition, process, or circumstance.</p>
    <p num="p-0013">Such cytometric measurements permit quantitative and/or qualitative determinations about cells, populations of cells, organs, tissues, or organisms. Such determinations may be used in many ways including but not limited to diagnosis, biomedical research, engineering, epidemiology, medicine, agriculture, animal husbandry, livestock management, zoology, biopharmaceutical industry, and other fields. In addition to the ability to perform such measurements, current methods and instrumentation permit the separation of cells based on characteristics or parameters measured by cytometry as described above. Cells can be selected positively or negatively by the concentration, collection, or partitioning of cells of interest or by the removal of cells that are not desired or of interest in the preparation. Such selection can be controlled on the basis of any parameter, characteristic, or combination of parameters or characteristics that can be determined as described above.</p>
    <p num="p-0014">Cells identified by methods including or related to those described above can be separated, partitioned, concentrated, depleted, or collected into any arbitrary number of groups. One common separation method (depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) uses electrostatic forces to divert an electrically or electrostatically charged stream, droplet, or droplets containing a cell or cells having desired or undesired properties. The diverted cells are collected or discarded as appropriate to the particular application, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. Other separation methods include the use of fluidic devices including valves to divert cells in a fluid stream to alternate pathways, channels, tubes, or elements for subsequent collection or disposal, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0015">There exist a number of methods and systems for performing flow cytometric sorting of cells. Among these are methods and systems designed specifically to perform flow cytometric sorting of mammalian sperm cells and, in particular, to sort the sperm cells into populations of sperm cells bearing X chromosomes and/or populations of sperm cells bearing Y chromosomes, with the purpose of increasing the probability that fertilization of an egg with the sorted sperm will result in offspring with a desired gender. For example, a dairy farmer may desire to sort the sperm of a bull so that bovine embryos may be produced, by artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, or other means, with sperm having an X chromosome to produce additional female bovine offspring.</p>
    <p num="p-0016">Flow cytometric sorting methods present a number of challenges, particularly with respect to sorting mammalian sperm cells for later use in producing offspring. Importantly, methods used to label and/or to differentiate between the cells and/or methods used to sort the cells must not adversely affect the viability of the cells. Often, one or more goals of the methods and/or systems involved (e.g., faster sorting, improved accuracy, etc.) conflict with other goals of the methods and/or systems. Various factors must be balanced and considered, including the temperatures, temperature changes, pressures and/or pressure changes to which the cells are subjected, the fluidic environments to which the cells are exposed, the forces applied to the cells, and the lifespan of the cell. For example, the rate at which a fluorescent molecule (e.g., a fluorochrome) enters a cell to bind to DNA within the nucleus of the cell (i.e., the rate at which cells may be stained), may increase as temperature increases. Thus, the throughput of a system (at least the throughput of the staining process) may increase with an increase in the temperature of the cells' environment. However, increased temperature may prove detrimental to the viability of the cells and/or the length of time that the cells remain viable. By contrast, maintaining the cells at the optimal temperature for viability may increase the time required for staining (and measuring and sorting) the cells, such that the process takes longer than is practical or such that the cells are not viable after the time required to complete the process.</p>
    <p num="p-0017">Another challenge associated with sorting cells relates to the physical and optical properties of the cells. In particular, flattened or otherwise asymmetrical cells, such as mammalian red blood cells or sperm cells, exhibit anisotropic emission of energy (e.g., light). The complex geometries of a cell's interior and/or the complex geometries of the cell's boundaries act to refract and/or reflect light in ways that are highly dependent on the orientation of the cell with respect to any illumination sources and/or detectors used to differentiate between cells. For example, flow cytometry sorting of mammalian sperm cells into populations having X or Y chromosomes usually involves staining the cells with a fluorescent molecule that binds to DNA within the cells. The variation in DNA content between the X and Y chromosomes of most mammalian species (Y chromosomes generally containing less DNA than X chromosomes) results in relatively greater fluorescence from cells containing X chromosomes. However, the difference in DNA content of X and Y chromosomes is typically on the order of only a few percent and, often, cell geometry and/or orientation can affect the detected fluorescence by a percentage that far exceeds the percentage difference in DNA content between the X and Y chromosomes. Additionally, such analysis requires that cells pass through the detection region singly, such that a detector does not interpret fluorescence from two cells as fluorescence from a single cell.</p>
    <p num="p-0018">Flow cytometry sorting systems frequently employ a core-in-sheath fluidic mechanism to carry the cells through the detection region. As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, a relatively slow moving stream <b>50</b> of an aqueous suspension of cells <b>52</b> is injected into a relatively faster moving flow <b>54</b> of sheath fluid. This arrangement focuses the cells <b>52</b> into a stream <b>56</b>, referred to as the core stream. With appropriate selection of the pressures and consequent velocities of the core suspension and sheath fluid, the core stream is narrowed by hydrodynamic forces exerted by the sheath flow, and the cells in the core stream are distributed longitudinally such that they are carried one by one in the flow. The forces that elongate and narrow the core stream have the additional benefit of orienting the cells <b>52</b> such that a lengthwise axis <b>58</b> of the cell <b>52</b> is parallel to the direction of flow of the single file stream <b>56</b>. However, the orientation of the cells about the lengthwise axis <b>58</b> remains more or less random. Thus, as each cell <b>52</b> passes through the detection area, light incident upon the cell, light emitted from the cell (e.g., fluorescent light), and light reflected off of the cell, remains dependent on the orientation of the cell <b>52</b>. This is especially true of many types of mammalian sperm cells.</p>
    <p num="p-0019">There are a number of solutions to the problem of sperm cell orientation with respect to illumination and detection of cells within flow cytometry systems. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> illustrates one solution, which solution employs a cut, beveled tip <b>60</b> on a tube <b>62</b> injecting a sample stream <b>64</b> into a sheath flow <b>66</b>. The flattened, beveled tip <b>60</b> helps to orient the cells about their lengthwise axes <b>58</b> within the sheath flow <b>66</b> such that the flat faces of the cells tend to align in a consistent direction. Another solution (which may be combined with the beveled tip solution) employs two detectors <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> orthogonal to each other (a 0-degree detector <b>68</b> and a 90-degree detector <b>70</b>) which are used in combination to estimate the orientation of each cell <b>52</b> as it passes through a detection area <b>72</b> and to measure the fluorescence of those cells that are found to be appropriately oriented such that precise quantization of the fluorescent signal is possible. The solutions employing hydrodynamic orientation of cells around the lengthwise axis generally yield populations in which the desired alignment for fluorescence measurement is achieved for about 70% or less of the cells in the sample flow, which decreases the throughput of the instrument and results in the discarding of improperly oriented cells.</p>
    <p num="p-0020">Still another solution to the problems associated with cell geometry and orientation utilizes optical detection along the same axis as the core-in-sheath flow that carries the cells. In one such solution, epi-illumination optics are used to illuminate the cell and detect light emitted by the cell. As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, a sample stream <b>74</b> carried by a sheath flow <b>76</b> travels directly towards a microscope objective lens <b>78</b>, eliminating the dependence on the orientation of the cell (e.g., a sperm cell <b>80</b>) about a lengthwise axis <b>82</b> of the cell <b>80</b>. However, the trajectory of the cell <b>80</b> towards the objective lens <b>78</b> requires that the cell <b>80</b> change trajectory immediately after passing through a detection area <b>82</b> (i.e., the focal point <b>84</b> of the objective lens <b>78</b>). The system accomplishes this trajectory change by using a transverse flow <b>86</b> of fluid. Uncertainty in the position of individual cells may be introduced after the analysis by the convergence <b>88</b> of the transverse fluid flow <b>86</b> and the sheath flow <b>76</b> and fluid stream <b>74</b>. Such position uncertainty may render the system inoperable to perform cell sorting because the location of the cell <b>80</b> within the converged flow may become unpredictable immediately after the cell passes through the detection area <b>82</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0021">Yet another solution, illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>, utilizes one or more parabolic reflectors <b>102</b> to illuminate cells uniformly and/or to collect light radially from the cells. The system utilizes a nozzle <b>104</b> to emit a stream/jet <b>106</b> of liquid containing individual cells <b>92</b>. The stream <b>106</b> moves through a detection region <b>94</b> and through a hole <b>96</b> in the parabolic reflector <b>102</b>. At some point after passing through the detection region, the stream <b>106</b> is broken into droplets <b>90</b> which may be electrically charged. Thereafter, each of the droplets <b>90</b> may be sorted by, for example, deflecting the charged droplet <b>90</b> and electrically charged deflector plates <b>98</b> to deflect the droplets into one or more receptacles <b>100</b>. Problematically, this âjet-in-airâ configuration subjects the stream <b>106</b> (and the cells <b>92</b> contained within the stream <b>106</b>) to a drop in pressure as the stream <b>106</b> exits the nozzle <b>104</b>. Sudden changes in pressure (and the increased pressures within the nozzle itself), can adversely affect the viability of the cell <b>92</b> as can the subsequent impact of the cell <b>92</b> into the receptacle <b>100</b>. Thus, the pressure and speed of the stream <b>106</b> exiting the nozzle <b>104</b> must remain below any threshold that could damage the cells <b>92</b>, which decreases the throughput of the system. Additionally, the movement of the droplets <b>90</b> through the atmosphere may require environmental constraints including cleanliness of the room air (e.g., a âclean roomâ) and temperature-control.</p>
    <p num="p-0022">Thus, even with the relatively advanced state of flow cytometry, there exists an ongoing need in the art to provide more efficient, more sensitive, and more precise methods of and devices for cell separation and/or identification.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY</heading> <p num="p-0023">A method and apparatus is described for detecting, selectively altering by functional and/or physical modification, and collecting desired or undesired cells in a population using flow cytometry. The method does not rely on parabolic reflectors or orthogonal detection to detect and categorize cells, as is the case for common existing cytometric sorting methods and apparatus. Instead, the method employs an objective lens having an optical axis coaxial with the flow of the sample through a detection area. The method may or may not rely on the diversion or breakup of the flow stream of cells or the assortment of cells to different receiving vessels or pathways, as is also the case for common existing cytometric sorting methods and apparatus.</p>
    <p num="p-0024">The method contemplates the use of a controllable energy source, such as, but not limited to, an electromagnetic radiation source such as a laser, to irradiate desired or undesired cells in a population that have been identified using cytometric detection techniques. The controllable energy source is selectively directed to cells of interest based on their measured properties or characteristics, after their analysis in the cytometer, in certain aspect within one second of their analysis while the cells remain in the fluidic flow of the device. Such cells may be functionally or physically altered by the imparted energy. Depending on the particular use and the particular embodiment of the methods or apparatus, the resulting cell population may be functionally or physically depleted of undesired cells, or may be modified in such a way as to permit the subsequent enrichment of desired cells or the removal of undesired cells. The described methods and apparatus are broadly useful in applications where the enrichment or depletion of cells is required. In some embodiments, the method and/or apparatus alters liquid containing desired or undesired cells in a population that have been identified using cytometric detection techniques, and may not alter the cells directly. In such embodiments, the method and/or apparatus may rely on the diversion or breakup of the flow stream of cells or the assortment of cells to different receiving vessels or pathways.</p>
    <p num="p-0025">One aspect of the described methods and apparatus includes the use thereof for enrichment, selection, functional alteration, or depletion of sperm cells in a population on the basis of the sex chromosome, X or Y, contained in the cells. The methods and apparatus include the use of alternate designs for the fluidics and optical systems of a cytometer, including in one aspect, an apparatus where optical measurement components and/or a cell-altering energy source are/is oriented orthogonal to the fluidic stream, and in another aspect, an apparatus where some such components may also or alternatively be oriented in the same axis as the fluidic stream and/or at oblique angles to it.</p>
    <p num="p-0026">The flow cytometric methods and apparatus provide a novel method and apparatus permitting positive or negative selection of cells by observing the cells and accurately classifying each cell independently of the cell's orientation about its longest axis, and subsequently using the classification to determine whether to modify, derivatize, damage, kill, or fragment the cell in the course of the cytometry procedure. The presently described methods and apparatus incorporate the application of forces, energy, or irradiation to desired or undesired cells coincident with or following within one second of the cytometric measurement to effect changes in those cells that alter them physically or functionally. Such altered cells, or their debris or derivatives, are in one aspect retained in the resulting preparation or in other aspects are enriched or removed, depending on the requirements of the particular use or application.</p>
    <p num="p-0027">An embodiment is described that permits the functional and/or physical separation of spermatozoa bearing X chromosomes from spermatozoa bearing Y chromosomes and/or of spermatozoa bearing Y chromosomes from spermatozoa bearing X chromosomes. In this embodiment, the relative DNA content of individual spermatozoa in a population of spermatozoa is measured indirectly, utilizing a well known property of DNA-associating chemicals such as, but not limited to, bisbenzimide, SYBR dyes, such as SYBR-14, Hoechst 33342, Hoechst 33258, ethidium bromide, acridine orange, DAPI, chromomycin, mithramycin, olivomycin and other chemicals known in the art that exhibit enhanced fluorescence when associated with DNA. The measurement is accomplished by observing a cell as the cell moves within a stream flowing toward the observation point, preferably by an objective lens having an optical axis coaxial with the flow of the stream. Cells containing relatively more DNA (i.e., a higher DNA content) are presumed to contain the larger X chromosome, and cells containing relatively less DNA (i.e., a lower DNA content) are presumed to contain the smaller Y chromosome. In some embodiments of the method where cells having only one of the sex chromosomes are desired in the final preparation, the method utilizes a laser energy source directed to cells, in one aspect, coincident with or in another aspect, within one second or less of their analysis, where the laser energy source can be rapidly modulated to irradiate cells that contain the undesired sex chromosome and/or cells whose sex chromosome content is uncertain. In one aspect of this embodiment, the method utilizes a laser energy source that deposits energy of sufficient quality and/or quantity to modify, derivatize, disrupt, disable, and/or kill the undesired cells. Such changes in the selected cells involve, in one aspect, the fragmenting of the cells or, in an alternative aspect, are less disrupting, depending on the application. For example, in embodiments of the method where identified and/or isolated sperm are to be used for fertilization and/or reproduction, rendering undesired cells incapable of producing viable offspring, for instance by disruption of the sequence or structure of DNA molecules in the cells, or by decreasing their motility such that they are mostly infertile in use in artificial insemination, is in one aspect sufficient to produce the desired preparation. In other aspects, the undesired cells are rendered non-motile, killed, modified, or inactivated in some other way to affect the reproductive capacity of the undesired cells. In an alternative aspect, undesired cells are modified or derivatized in a way that permits their subsequent removal or partial removal from the preparation of desired cells.</p>
    <p num="p-0028">In another embodiment, the configuration of the cytometer employs one or more optical elements used, in one aspect, for the measurement of cellular properties and/or in another aspect, used in the delivery of energy to cells, wherein at least one optical element, preferably an optical axis of an objective lens, is oriented in the same axis as the flow of the cells undergoing analysis. Thus, in some embodiments, a method and apparatus is provided utilizing an optical element and, in particular, an objective lens positioned coaxial with the fluid flow, for the illumination, measurement, or delivery of energy to cells. In another embodiment, a method and apparatus is provided utilizing one or more additional optical elements, alone or in combination, positioned at 90 degrees to the fluid stream for measurements or for the delivery of energy to cells. In still another embodiment, a method and apparatus is provided utilizing one or more additional optical elements, alone or in combination, positioned non-coaxial to the fluid stream for measurements or for the delivery of energy to cells. In yet another embodiment, a method and apparatus is provided utilizing one or more additional optical elements, alone or in combination, positioned at an oblique angle to the fluid stream for measurements or for the delivery of energy to cells. As used herein, an âoblique angleâ is an angle, such as an acute or obtuse angle, that is not a right angle or a multiple of a right angle.</p>
    <p num="p-0029">Some embodiments provide a method for modifying a cell of interest in a population of cells comprising the step of contacting the cell of interest with a controllable energy source that modifies the cell of interest upon identification of a cell as a cell of interest in a population of cells, without separating the cell of interest from the population of cells upon modification by the energy source.</p>

    <p num="p-0034">In some embodiments, one or more analyses are accomplished by observing a cell as the cell moves within a stream flowing toward an observation point, preferably by an objective lens having an optical axis coaxial with the flow of the stream. After passing through the observation point, the stream changes directions in some embodiments, while the order and/or location of the cells within the stream remain determinable. In some embodiments, a controllable energy source may selectively alter one or more of the cells according to the one or more analyses. In some embodiments, the controllable energy source is positioned coaxial to the newly directed stream, while in other embodiments, the controllable energy source is positioned perpendicularly or at an oblique angle relative to the newly directed stream. In some embodiments, which may or may not include a controllable energy source, a nozzle may eject stream, forming droplets that may be sorted using known means (e.g., by using a controllable energy source to apply an electrostatic charge, controlling pressure in various fluid flow pathways, etc.).</p>
    <p num="p-0035">In some related embodiments, the controllable energy source is directed to the location of the cell in a flow stream in a manner selected from the group consisting of continuous stream, pulsed stream, intermittent on/off cycles, periodic focus and defocus of the energy source and intermittent rapid diversion of the energy source to the stream.</p>

For example, in a flow cytometer comprising detectors and a controllable energy source, either the detectors or the controllable energy source, or both, are positioned co-axial to the flow stream. In a related embodiment, any detection apparatus and or optical elements used in the detection of properties of cells in the flow is positioned coaxial to the flow stream.</p>

It is contemplated, in some embodiments, that the sperm cell is identified as a cell of interest based on a desired property of difference in DNA content between X chromosome-bearing sperm and Y chromosome-bearing sperm.</p>
    <p num="p-0045">The described methods and apparatus further provide that the population of cells are collected in a collection chamber for further use. In some embodiments, the collection chamber contains cells of interest which have been modified by the controllable energy source and cells that have not been modified by the controllable energy source.

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading> <p num="p-0072">The present specification describes methods, systems, and apparatus for cell separation based on flow cytometry. Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this the claimed inventions belong.</p>
    <p num="p-0073">It is noted here that, as used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms âa,â âan,â and âtheâ include plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.</p>
    <p num="p-0074">As persons of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate, unless otherwise indicated as being important to the understanding of the described methods and apparatus, the included figures are not drawn to scale.</p>
    <p num="p-0075">As used herein, the following terms have the meanings ascribed to them unless specified otherwise.</p>
    <p num="p-0076">The term âcellsâ refers to the analyte in the described methods and apparatus, this matter including, but not limited to cells, viruses, bodies, or particles. The term âcells of interestâ or âcell of interestâ refers to a cell having a desired property which property can be detected during flow of the cell through the flow cytometric apparatus. A âdesired propertyâ refers to a certain characteristic that distinguishes the cell having the desired property from a cell not having said characteristics. Cells having a desired property are within a âdesired sub-populationâ of cells. Exemplary measurable or detectable cell characteristics in a cell of interest include, but are not limited to, protein composition, protein content DNA composition, DNA content, cell surface markers, molecule size, light absorbance, light reflection, fluorescence, light scatter, polarization, electrical properties of the cells, magnetic properties, morphological properties, membrane permeability, membrane fluidity, and redox state. One of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that a cytometer may measure or detect any of a number of alternative characteristics in a cell of interest, and that these alternative characteristics are readily amenable to exploitation in the described methods and apparatus. In one aspect, the methods or apparatus exploit a âdesired propertyâ of a cell of interest to identify cells having this property.</p>
    <p num="p-0077">The term âfirst analysisâ refers to an initial analysis of cells as the cells proceed through a flow cytometric apparatus, which can be a tube, a cuvette, a region, a cell, a chamber, etc., to determine if the cells are cells of interest. In an aspect of some embodiments, detectors in a flow cytometer execute the first analysis.</p>
    <p num="p-0078">The term âsecond analysisâ as used herein refers to characterization of the cell of interest after the first analysis through the flow tube to determine whether to alter the cell of interest using an energy source. In an aspect of some embodiments, the second analysis takes place after, usually less than one second after, the first analysis.</p>
    <p num="p-0079">The terms âmodify,â âmodification,â âalter,â and âalteration,â as used herein, refer to using the energy source to induce changes to a cell. Modifications include, but are not limited to, direct effects on the cells, including but not limited to the modification of cellular components or chemicals including proteins, DNA, and substances involved in cellular metabolism; disruption, heating, cavitation, or explosions occurring in or near the cells; permeabilization or perforation of cells; and destruction, fragmentation, or morphological alteration of cells. In other aspects, modifications also or alternatively include indirect effects of the energy source, mediated by the energy source or by other factors, including chemical activation and/or deactivation, chemical crosslinking, or chemical derivitization of the cells or of one or more cellular components, the activation and/or deactivation of one or more chemical agents in or near the cells that cause the binding or association of such agents or their derivatives to the cell or its components, or the induction of altered functioning of the cells. In certain aspects, chemical agents, normally present within or otherwise applied to the cells, interact with the cells upon irradiation of the cells.</p>
    <p num="p-0080">The described methods and apparatus permit identification of cells of interest by detecting the presence or absence of any number of characteristics (e.g., a desired property) or parameters that can be determined, estimated, or reflected in measurements compatible with flow cytometric techniques. Cytometric measurements used to define cells or cellular populations of interest include in various aspects those discussed herein and those otherwise known in the art, as well as novel measurement methods, mechanisms, and/or apparatus that may be introduced or made applicable to flow cytometric analysis. Cells subjected to cytometric analysis through practice of the presently described methods and apparatus, may be labeled or unlabelled, or otherwise modified or unmodified using techniques and reagents known in the art.</p>
    <p num="p-0081">As used herein, the term âlabelâ refers to a composition detectable by spectroscopic, photochemical, biochemical, immunochemical, or chemical means. For example, useful labels include fluorescent dyes, electron-dense reagents, enzymes, biotin-streptavidin, dioxigenin, haptens, proteins for which antisera or monoclonal antibodies are available, or nucleic acid specific dyes. Thus, in the presently described methods and apparatus, the makeup, properties, and/or characteristic of cells with respect to any substance or parameter, measured directly or indirectly in any way is the basis for the identification of cells and cell populations for selection or exclusion.</p>
    <p num="p-0082">Examples of detectable makeup, properties, and/or characteristics of cells include, but are not limited to: measurements of properties of light interacting with the cells or emitted by the cells, such as absorbance, light scattering, luminescence, fluorescence, phosphorescence, polarization or depolarization of light, or other properties; properties of electricity including but not limited to inductance, capacitance, potential, current, or resistance of cells or of the surrounding medium; properties of electromagnetism including magnetism, paramagnetism, magnetic resonance, and/or interaction of the cell with or emission of electromagnetic forces and/or waves; imaging, image properties, morphological properties, or related properties derived from the collection and/or analysis of image or image-like properties of cells. In certain aspects, the measurement is an intrinsic quantity or quality of the cell, or in alternative aspects, the measurement is a value that indirectly reflects, represents, or approximates, a quantity or quality of the cell. In still other aspects, the measurement is both an intrinsic quantity or quality of the cell and an indirect reflection, representation, or approximation of a quantity or quality of the cell. By way of example and not limitation, a measure of fluorescence of a cell may reflect the intrinsic fluorescence of the cell or the measure of fluorescence of a cell may reflect the presence and/or quantity of a fluorochrome or fluorescent particle that binds to or associates with the cell and directly or indirectly reflects some property of the cell, or both.</p>
    <p num="p-0083">In some aspects of the described methods and apparatus, a sorting cytometer employs a technique that results in the physical or spatial separation of cells and cell populations. In other aspects of the described methods and apparatus, a sorting cytometer utilizes a technique that physically and/or functionally modifies selected cells in populations to permit their functional and/or physical separation and/or differentiation, optionally for subsequent use. In some aspects of the described method and apparatus, a sorting cytometer does not rely on immediate separation of cells by position, location, vessel, or time, but instead provides cells are that inactivated, incapacitated, disrupted, disarticulated, fragmented, or otherwise altered (i.e., âmodifiedâ) with respect to some desired property, that optionally allows separation or differentiation of subpopulations in the preparation. The nature of the modification depends, all or in part, on an intended application or use for identified cells, and thus, characteristics of the identified cells that are relevant in the application. For example and for purposes of explanation or clarification only, a malignant or otherwise immortal or rapidly growing cell might be considered functionally inactivated in the context of the preparation of normal somatic cells if the cell's capacity to reproduce is negatively affected or if the cell is killed. In another example, again for purposes of explanation or clarification only, where an application requires the removal from a population of a subpopulation of cells that produce an undesirable protein or other substance, a sorting cytometer may achieve this result by abrogating production of the substance in these cells, by killing the cells, and/or by modifying the cells to permit their physical removal from the population.</p>
    <p num="p-0084">The methods and apparatus presently described utilize, in some embodiments, an energy source for modification of cells or for the induction or initiation of processes such as chemical activation that may modify cells. Modifications induced by the energy source include in various aspects, direct effects on the cells, including but not limited to the modification of cellular components or chemicals including proteins, DNA, and substances involved in cellular metabolism; disruption, heating, cavitation, or explosions occurring in or near the cells; permeabilization or perforation of cells; and destruction, fragmentation, or morphological alteration of cells, including cells, viruses, bodies or particles. In other embodiments, modifications also or alternatively include indirect effects of the energy source, mediated by the energy source or by other factors, including chemical activation and/or deactivation, chemical crosslinking, or chemical derivitization of the cells or of one or more cellular components, the activation and/or deactivation of one or more chemical agents in or near the cells that cause the binding or association of such agents or their derivatives to the cell or its components, or the induction of altered functioning of the cells. In certain embodiments, chemical agents that react upon irradiation with the cells are normally present in the cells or in the application, or they are added as part of the method.</p>
    <p num="p-0085">In some embodiments, the described methods and apparatus incorporate the use of photoactivatable compounds that are induced to bind or associate with cells or cellular components upon irradiation with light of an appropriate intensity and energy. Such compounds in certain aspects induce sufficient crosslinking or denaturation of one or more cellular components that affect cellular processes or metabolism of cells of interest. Alternatively, such compounds in certain aspects induce sufficient crosslinking or denaturation of one or more cellular components that kill cells of interest. In another alternative, photoactivatable compounds used in the described methods and apparatus bind to selected cells and alter one or more properties of cells of interest in such a way as to render the cells of interest amenable to identification and/or enrichment and/or depletion in subsequent processes. Cells of interest that have been altered by chemical derivatization, such as the addition of a chemical substance, are in certain aspects removed, concentrated, or purified in a subsequent step by methods that utilize the properties or interactions of such a substance. For example, and for purposes of explanation and clarification only, cells of interest are, in one aspect, derivatized by the addition of a substance that is subsequently bound by an antibody that permits the capture or retention of the derivatized cell of interest by various means. Many such substances are contemplated, and in one aspect, such substances include a class of compounds containing or related to the 2,4-dinitrophenyl group (DNP), which in one aspect is recognized and specifically bound by antibodies recognizing DNP. Accordingly, photoactivatable derivatives of DNP or related compounds are used in one aspect to derivatize cells of interest in an application of this type. Alternatively, derivatized cells of interest are captured or removed using strategies that cause the derivatized cells of interest to bind preferentially to certain substrates. For example and for purposes of explanation and clarification only, cells of interest derivatized using compounds containing or related to biotin are in one aspect captured or retained on substrates, surfaces, substances, media, compounds, or particles that bind or have been modified to bind biotin, for instance by the presence of avidin, streptavidin, biotin-binding antibodies, or other biotin-binding molecules. In another alternative related to this aspect, photoactivatable derivatives of biotin or related compounds are used to derivatize cells of interest in such an application. Alternately in other aspects, cells of interest are altered by the addition or association of chemical substances or compounds before being subjected to selection and modification. In such a case, therefore, an embodiment of the methods and apparatus described herein utilizes alteration of the added substance on selected cells to permit the differentiation of such cells from others in the population. For instance, and for purposes of explanation and clarification only, in one aspect all cells in a population are derivatized by the addition of a photolabile chemical compound before analysis, and in one aspect, specific cells are targeted for modification using the energy source of the apparatus to modify the photolabile chemical compound on those cells.</p>
    <p num="p-0086">In some embodiments of a cytometer (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), cells pass into an interrogation or analysis chamber, cuvette, stream, or other analysis position or region in the usual way, familiar in the art, for flow cytometric analysis and/or sorting. The cytometer identifies cells by their measured properties as described above, including but not limited to such properties as fluorescence and/or light scattering, as having a desired property or not having a desired property in the final preparation. A flow of fluid carries the cells through the region of the cytometer and, in one aspect, past one or more laser beams, detectors, and/or other apparatus that detect quantities and qualities of the cells. In one such aspect, the flow of fluid moves the cells toward an optical element having an axis generally coaxially aligned with the fluid flow. By way of example and not limitation, the optical element may include a lens, such as an objective lens, and/or may include one or more detectors, laser beams, and/or other energy sources. The light and/or energy passing between the cells and the detectors, laser beams, and or other energy sources may pass through the optical element (e.g., the objective lens) that is generally coaxially aligned with the flow the cells through the relevant portion of the cytometer. The position of each cell in the cytometer at any point in time is, in one aspect, determined directly or indirectly and/or estimated from the velocity of the cell or fluid passing through the relevant portion of the instrument. A cell that has passed some or all of the analysis position(s) in the region is, in one aspect, identified as having a desired property or not having a desired property in the final preparation. Such a determination is, in one aspect, made by a computer and/or analogue and/or digital electrical or electronic and/or software and/or computer hardware data analysis device or devices. Such a device compares individual or multiple properties, measurements, and/or characteristic of each cell to one or a set or group of properties, measurements, and/or characteristics defined by the operator of the apparatus. Alternatively, the properties to which the measured properties are to be compared are, in one aspect, determined automatically using algorithms or programs included in or with the cytometer.</p>
    <p num="p-0087">The set of properties against which cells measured in the cytometer are compared in one aspect defines one or more subpopulations of cells of interest that have a desired property or do not have a desired property in the cell preparation. The determination of whether a cell that is passing through the analysis region of the instrument is a member of a particular subpopulation of cells of interest is, in one aspect, made rapidly such that the cell's status as having a desired property or not having a desired property in the cell preparation is determined at a time when the position of the cell in the flow system of the instrument is determined, in certain aspects, usually less than one second after entering the analysis region of the instrument. Once the determination has been made, cells in one aspect are acted upon by an energy or force that is selectively imparted to cells that satisfy or do not satisfy the selection criteria. The force or energy in various aspects inactivates, incapacitates, disrupts, disarticulates, fragments, or otherwise alters the cells of interest with respect to a desired property that is relevant to an optional subsequent application, or the force or energy in alternative aspects modifies, and/or derivatives, or causes the cells of interest to be derivatized in a way that permits subsequent separation or differentiation of one or more subpopulations of cells of interest in the preparation.</p>
    <p num="p-0088">Such a force or energy, in various aspects, is imparted by one or more lasers or other light and/or electromagnetic sources directed to the location of cells in the flowing stream, in such a manner that the energy source can be rapidly diverted, defocused, or turned off to permit the passage of cells that are not selected for modification. For example, and for purposes of clarification and explanation only, a high energy and/or high intensity laser, capable of being rapidly pulsed or turned on and off, exposes selected cells to damaging radiation rendering them non-functional in the context of any desired use. In some aspects, the force or energy passes through an optical element generally coaxially aligned with the flow of cells as the cells pass through the relevant area of the cytometer. In any event, all cells, both those selected and acted upon by the modifying force or energy, and those not selected and not acted upon by the force or energy, continue to migrate with the cellular flow and exit the region of the apparatus in which the measurement of cellular properties and the modification of selected cells is performed. The effluent is collected and it contains modified and unmodified cells as well as, in certain aspects, fragments, or residues of cells, as well as fluid, solutions, and/or buffers used in the process. In various aspects, the effluent is used further in this form, or in other aspects it is concentrated, fractionated, or otherwise processed further to achieve desired properties and/or composition.</p>
    <p num="p-0089"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref> depict various embodiments of a sorting flow cytometer according to the described methods and apparatus. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in particular depicts an embodiment of a basic flow path <b>110</b> of such a cytometer. A sheath fluid input tube <b>112</b> allows pressurized sheath fluid to enter the flow path <b>110</b> at a sheath fluid input <b>114</b>, creating a flow <b>116</b> of sheath fluid through the flow path <b>110</b>. Downstream from the sheath fluid input <b>114</b> and preferably in a region of smooth, laminar flow of the sheath fluid, an analyte fluid input tube <b>118</b> allows a stream <b>120</b> of analyte fluid (i.e., a fluid in which an analyte is suspended, carried, etc.) to enter the flow path <b>110</b> through an analyte input <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, the analyte input <b>122</b> is disposed centrally within the flow <b>116</b> of sheath fluid and/or centrally within the flow path <b>110</b>, and oriented such that the stream <b>120</b> of analyte fluid is parallel to the flow <b>116</b> of sheath fluid as the analyte fluid enters the flow path <b>110</b>. Of course, the analyte input <b>122</b> need not be central to either of the flow <b>116</b> of sheath fluid or the flow path <b>110</b>, and one of ordinary skill in the art could envision embodiments in which the stream <b>120</b> of analyte fluid is other than parallel to the flow <b>116</b> of sheath fluid as the stream <b>120</b> of analyte fluid enters the flow path <b>110</b>. The flow rate and pressure of the flow <b>116</b> of sheath fluid relative to the stream <b>120</b> of analyte fluid compress and constrict the stream <b>120</b> of analyte fluid to be narrow relative to the flow <b>116</b> of the sheath fluid. The flow <b>116</b> of sheath fluid and the stream <b>120</b> of analyte fluid combine to form a sample flow <b>123</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0090">The flow path <b>110</b> may change direction in a region <b>124</b>, but preferably thereafter includes a region <b>126</b> free of both obstacles and abrupt changes in flow direction, and serving to stabilize the sample flow <b>123</b> before the sample flow <b>123</b> reaches an interrogation area <b>128</b> (i.e., an observation area, analysis area, nominal focal point, etc.). The path of the sample flow <b>123</b> through the flow path <b>110</b> defines a flow axis <b>130</b>. In some embodiments, the stream <b>120</b> of analyte fluid and, in particular, the analytes (i.e., the cells) within the stream <b>120</b> of analyte fluid generally travels through the flow path <b>110</b> along the flow axis <b>130</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0091">After reaching and/or passing through the interrogation area <b>128</b>, the sample flow <b>123</b> is diverted. In some embodiments, the flow path <b>110</b> changes directions at a corner <b>132</b> (indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by a broken line). In other embodiments, the sample flow <b>123</b> encounters a transverse flow <b>134</b> as it reaches an end <b>136</b> of the region <b>126</b>. The transverse flow <b>134</b> redirects the sample flow <b>123</b>. In some embodiments, the corner <b>132</b> or the transverse flow <b>134</b> causes a 90-degree change in the direction of the sample flow <b>123</b>. However, the sample flow <b>123</b> may, in alternative embodiments, vary by more or less than 90 degrees. In any event, after changing direction, the sample flow <b>123</b> may flow to a collection vessel <b>138</b>, and may pass through one or more flow path elements <b>140</b> (e.g., flow regulators, filters, etc.) before reaching the collection vessel <b>138</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0092">An objective lens <b>142</b> disposed generally at or near the corner <b>132</b> or at or near the intersection of the sample flow <b>123</b> with the transverse flow <b>134</b> operates to create a focal point (not shown) within the interrogation area <b>128</b>. An optical axis <b>144</b> of the objective lens <b>142</b> is generally coaxially aligned with the flow axis <b>130</b> of the flow path <b>110</b> as the flow path <b>110</b> passes through the interrogation area <b>128</b>. Of course, the optical axis <b>144</b> and the flow axis <b>130</b> need not be perfectly coaxial, and may vary such that the optical axis <b>144</b> is parallel to and offset from the flow axis <b>130</b>, such that the optical axis <b>144</b> is at an oblique angle with respect to the flow axis <b>130</b>, etc.</p>
    <p num="p-0093"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an exemplary sorting flow cytometer <b>151</b> including various characteristics of the described methods and apparatus. Similarly to the embodiment of the flow path <b>110</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts the sheath flow input tube <b>112</b> and the sample fluid input tube <b>118</b>, introducing respectively the flow <b>116</b> of sheath fluid and the stream <b>120</b> of analyte fluid through the sheath fluid input <b>114</b> and the analyte fluid input <b>122</b>. In particular, the analyte fluid depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes mammalian sperm cells <b>150</b> and a buffer solution <b>152</b> carrying the mammalian sperm cells <b>150</b>. As the flow <b>116</b> of sheath fluid and the flow <b>120</b> of analyte fluid merge to form the sample flow <b>123</b>, the respective flow rates cause the cells <b>150</b> to form a generally single-file stream and to align their lengthwise axis (i.e., along the length of the cells' tail) with the direction of the sample flow <b>123</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0094">Referring still to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an embodiment of a sorting flow cytometer includes a first analysis and a second analysis. As the cells <b>150</b> proceed through the flow path <b>110</b> with the sample flow <b>123</b>, the first analysis may determine whether the cells are of interest, may determine the rate at which the cells are moving through the flow path <b>110</b>, may determine whether, at a given point in the sample flow <b>123</b>, the cells <b>150</b> are too close together for one or more later analyses, whether the cells <b>150</b> are oriented tail-first or head-first, etc. In the embodiment depicted by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the first analysis occurs as the cells <b>150</b> reach a point <b>154</b> in the flow path <b>110</b>. A first analysis illumination source <b>156</b> directs energy <b>158</b> toward the point <b>154</b>. The energy <b>158</b> may interact with each cell <b>150</b> to scatter the energy <b>158</b> or to otherwise interact with the cell <b>150</b>, an antibody associated with the cell <b>150</b>, a fluorochrome (e.g., fluorescein) associated with the cell <b>150</b>, etc. A detector <b>160</b> may detect resulting energy <b>162</b> (e.g., the scattered energy, the resulting fluorescent signal, etc.) and send a corresponding signal via a connection <b>164</b> to a controller <b>166</b>. The detector <b>160</b> may be disposed at any location appropriate to detect the energy <b>162</b>, including at an oblique angle from the point <b>154</b> (with respect to the illumination energy source <b>156</b>) or in line with the point <b>154</b>. The first analysis illumination source <b>156</b> is preferably a 488 nm laser, but may comprise any energy source suitable for the measurements contemplated in the first analysis. The first analysis illumination source <b>156</b> may be oriented such that the energy <b>158</b> travels perpendicularly to the sample flow <b>123</b> or may, alternatively, be oriented such that the energy <b>158</b> is incident upon the cells <b>150</b> at an oblique angle to the direction of the sample flow <b>123</b>. Moreover, the energy <b>158</b> and/or the energy <b>162</b> may pass through one or more optical elements (not shown) such as filters, lenses, etc., which may allow either or both of the illumination energy source <b>156</b> and the detector <b>160</b> to be positioned differently than depicted by creating a different optical path as generally known in the art.</p>
    <p num="p-0095">Some embodiments may omit the first analysis. For example, information gleaned from the second analysis (described in detail below) may prove sufficient both to determine which cells are of interest and to distinguish between cells in desired and un-desired sub-populations. Thus, the elements <b>154</b>-<b>164</b> may be omitted in some embodiments. Alternatively, some embodiments may include two or more first analyses and, accordingly, two or more sets of elements <b>154</b>-<b>164</b>. For example, and without limitation, the sample flow <b>123</b> may include one or more markers (e.g., included in the sheath flow <b>116</b>, attached or otherwise associated with some cells <b>150</b> in the sample stream <b>120</b>, etc.). A primary first analysis may detect one of the markers at a first point, and a secondary first analysis may detect the marker at a second point to determine the flow rate of cells in the sample flow <b>123</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0096">In any event, the sample flow <b>123</b> proceeds after the first analysis to carry the cells <b>150</b> along the flow path <b>110</b>. As the cells <b>150</b> pass through a point <b>170</b>, the second analysis characterizes the cells <b>150</b>, as described below, to determine whether to modify each cell <b>150</b>. As each cell <b>150</b> reaches the point <b>170</b>, a second analysis illumination source <b>172</b> directs energy <b>174</b> toward the point <b>170</b>. The energy <b>174</b> may interact with the cell <b>150</b>, an antibody associated with the cell <b>150</b>, a fluorochrome (e.g., Hoechst stain) associated with the cell <b>150</b> or with DNA within the cell <b>150</b>, etc. In some embodiments, the second analysis illumination source <b>172</b> is an ultraviolet laser emitting the energy <b>174</b> in the form of ultraviolet radiation that interacts with particles of Hoechst stain attached to the DNA inside of the cell <b>150</b> to cause fluorescence proportional to the DNA content of the cell <b>150</b>, as generally known in the art. The second analysis illumination source <b>172</b> may be oriented such that the beam <b>174</b> is perpendicular to the sample flow <b>123</b>, as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. However, the second analysis illumination source <b>172</b> may also be located at an oblique angle with respect to the sample flow <b>123</b>. Moreover, the energy <b>174</b> may pass through one or more optical elements (not shown) such as filters, lenses, etc., which may allow the second analysis illumination source <b>172</b> to be positioned differently than depicted by creating an optical path that is not straight.</p>
    <p num="p-0097">The interaction of the energy <b>174</b> with the cell <b>150</b> or with elements inside the cell <b>150</b>, causes resulting energy <b>176</b> to radiate from the cell <b>150</b>. The objective lens <b>142</b>, positioned such that the optical axis <b>144</b> of the objective lens <b>142</b> is generally coaxial with the sample flow <b>123</b>, operates to focus the energy <b>176</b>. A focal point <b>178</b> of the objective lens <b>142</b> is located generally at the point <b>170</b>, but may be located so as to detect the resulting energy <b>176</b> from the cell <b>150</b> slightly after the energy <b>174</b> illuminates the cell <b>150</b> (i.e., the focal point <b>178</b> may be slightly closer to the objective lens <b>142</b> than the point <b>170</b>). A detector <b>180</b> situated so as to receive energy <b>182</b> focused by the objective lens <b>142</b> detects the focused energy <b>182</b> from the cell <b>150</b>, and sends a corresponding signal via a connection <b>184</b> to the controller <b>166</b>. Of course, one or more optical elements, such as a filter <b>186</b> may act to alter or redirect the energy <b>182</b> between the objective lens <b>142</b> and the detector <b>180</b>. In some embodiments, the objective lens <b>142</b> creates the focal point <b>178</b> prior to the corner <b>132</b> or the convergence of the transverse flow <b>134</b> and the sample flow <b>123</b>. In other embodiments, the objective lens <b>142</b> creates a focal point (not shown) at or near the corner <b>132</b> or the convergence of the transverse flow <b>134</b> and the sample flow <b>123</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0098">The controller <b>166</b>, which may include one or more microprocessors <b>188</b>, one or more crystal oscillators <b>190</b>, one or more memories <b>192</b> storing one or more routines <b>194</b>, etc., interprets the signals received from the detector <b>160</b> and/or the detector <b>180</b>, to determine for each cell <b>150</b> whether the cell <b>150</b> is part of a desired sub-population of cells. For example, in some embodiments, the cells <b>150</b> are mammalian sperm cells, and the controller <b>166</b> interprets signals received from the detector <b>180</b> to determine whether each cell <b>150</b> bears an X chromosome or a Y chromosome. As generally known by those of ordinary skill in the art, in mammalian sperm cells Y chromosomes generally contain less DNA than X chromosomes. Accordingly, by analyzing the fluorescence (i.e., the resulting energy <b>176</b>) emitted by the stain in the cell <b>150</b> upon illumination by the second analysis illumination source <b>172</b>, the controller <b>166</b> may generally determine whether the cell <b>150</b> carries an X or a Y chromosome. In some embodiments, one of the routines <b>194</b> continuously monitors the statistical distribution of detected fluorescent signals to improve with the passage of time the accuracy of the determination.</p>
    <p num="p-0099">Still referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in some embodiments, the controller <b>166</b>, according to the determination of whether a cell <b>150</b> is part of a desired sub-population, outputs a signal to a controllable energy source <b>196</b> via a connection <b>198</b>. The controllable energy source <b>196</b> may emit energy <b>197</b> directed at a point <b>199</b> in the sample flow <b>123</b>. In some embodiments, the controller <b>166</b> operates to coordinate the signal to the controllable energy source <b>196</b> and/or the point <b>199</b> is selected (e.g., by aiming, by one or more lenses, mirrors, etc.) according to the rate at which the cell <b>150</b> moves through the flow path <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the point <b>199</b> may be located prior to the corner <b>132</b> or the convergence of the transverse flow <b>134</b> and the sample flow <b>123</b>, to simplify the determination of the position of the cell <b>150</b> traveling along the flow path <b>110</b>. In other embodiments, the point <b>199</b> may be located after the corner <b>132</b>, or may be located at or after the convergence of the transverse flow <b>134</b> and the sample flow <b>123</b>. In the example above, the controller <b>166</b> may output a signal to cause the controllable energy source <b>196</b> to emit the energy <b>197</b> in response to a determination that the cell <b>150</b> has an X chromosome or in response to a determination that the cell <b>150</b> has a Y chromosome. Alternatively, the controller <b>166</b> may output a signal to cause the controllable energy source <b>196</b> to stop emitting energy <b>197</b> in response to a determination that the cell <b>150</b> has an X chromosome or in response to a determination that the cell <b>150</b> has a Y chromosome. The energy <b>197</b> emitted from the controllable energy source <b>196</b> may act to disable the cell <b>150</b> or render the cell <b>150</b> non-viable (e.g., by modifying cellular components or chemicals including proteins, DNA, and substances involved in cellular metabolism; by causing disruption, heating, cavitation, or explosions in or near the cell <b>150</b>; by causing permeabilization or perforation of the cell <b>150</b>; and/or by causing destruction, fragmentation, or morphological alteration of the cell <b>150</b>), may act to alter (e.g., by interacting with a chemical in or attached to a cellular component) the cell so that it may later be identified and/or removed from the desired sub-population of cells <b>150</b>, or may act to favorably affect the cell. In some embodiments, the controllable energy source <b>196</b> is a laser and, in particular, may be a laser outputting energy in the visible or infrared parts of the spectrum. In some embodiments, the laser outputs energy having a wavelength of 690 nm. In other embodiments, the controllable energy source <b>196</b> may output other types or wavelengths of radiation, such as X-rays, microwaves, visible light, infrared light, ultraviolet light, or any other type of energy having a desired effect on a cell <b>150</b>. Of course, in response to the determination of whether a cell is part of the desired sub-population the controller <b>166</b> may: (1) emit energy <b>197</b> to adversely affect cells <b>150</b> determined not to be part of the desired sub-population (while leaving alone cells <b>150</b> determined to be part of the desired sub-population); (2) may emit energy <b>197</b> to positively affect cells <b>150</b> determined to be part of the desired sub-population (while leaving alone cells <b>150</b> determined not to be part of the desired sub-population); (3) may stop emitting energy <b>197</b> to avoid positively affecting cells <b>150</b> determined not to be part of the desired sub-population (while continuing to emit energy <b>197</b> to positively affect cells <b>150</b> determined to be part of the desired sub-population); or (4) may stop emitting energy <b>197</b> to avoid adversely affecting cells <b>150</b> determined to be part of the desired sub-population (while continuing to emit energy <b>197</b> to adversely affect cells <b>150</b> determined not to be part of the desired sub-population). Moreover, in some embodiments, the controller <b>166</b> may treat indeterminate cells <b>150</b> (e.g., cells <b>150</b> for which the controller <b>166</b> cannot make a determination, cells <b>150</b> that are too close together, etc.) in the same manner in which the controller <b>166</b> treats cells determined not to be in the desired sub-population.</p>
    <p num="p-0100"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an exemplary sorting flow cytometer <b>200</b> including various characteristics of the described methods and apparatus.

However, while not illustrated, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the first analysis may be included, if desired, in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As in the embodiment depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the sample flow <b>123</b> carries the cells <b>150</b> along the flow path <b>110</b>. As the cells <b>150</b> pass through the point <b>170</b>, the second analysis (which, in the depiction of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> does not follow any first analysis) characterizes the cells <b>150</b>, as described above, to determine whether to modify each cell <b>150</b>. That is, as each cell <b>150</b> reaches the point <b>170</b>, the second analysis illumination source <b>172</b> directs the energy <b>174</b> toward the point <b>170</b>, and the energy <b>174</b> interacts with the cell <b>150</b>, as described above. Of course, the second analysis illumination source <b>172</b> may be an ultraviolet laser and the energy <b>174</b> may interact with molecules of Hoechst 33342 stain attached to the DNA inside of the cell <b>150</b>. The second analysis illumination source <b>172</b> may be oriented such that the beam <b>174</b> is perpendicular to the sample flow <b>123</b>, as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. However, the second analysis illumination source <b>172</b> may also be at an oblique angle with respect to the sample flow <b>123</b>. Moreover, the energy <b>174</b> may pass through one or more optical elements (not shown) such as filters, lenses, etc., which may allow the second analysis illumination source <b>172</b> to be positioned differently than depicted by creating an optical path that is not straight.</p>
    <p num="p-0101">The resulting energy <b>176</b> radiating from the cell <b>150</b> propagates toward the objective lens <b>142</b>, which is positioned such that the optical axis <b>144</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the objective lens <b>142</b> is generally coaxial with the sample flow <b>123</b>, and operates to focus the energy <b>176</b>. The focal point <b>178</b> of the objective lens <b>142</b> is located generally at the point <b>170</b>, but may alternatively be located so as to detect the resulting energy <b>176</b> from the cell <b>150</b> slightly after the energy <b>174</b> illuminates the cell <b>150</b>. One or more optical elements may direct the focused energy <b>182</b> from the objective lens <b>142</b> to the detector <b>180</b>. For example, in the embodiment depicted by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the focused energy <b>182</b> passes through a beam splitter <b>202</b> and the filter <b>186</b> before reaching the detector <b>180</b>. Other optical elements (e.g., lenses, mirrors, filters, etc.) may also affect the path of the focused energy <b>182</b> between the objective lens <b>142</b> and the detector <b>180</b>. As in the embodiment depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in some embodiments the objective lens <b>142</b> creates the focal point <b>178</b> prior to the corner <b>132</b> or the convergence of the transverse flow <b>134</b> and the sample flow <b>123</b>. In other embodiments, the objective lens <b>142</b> creates a focal point (not shown) at or near the corner <b>132</b> or the convergence of the transverse flow <b>134</b> and the sample flow <b>123</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0102">The controller <b>166</b>, as described above with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, operates to interpret signals received (via the connection <b>184</b>) from the detector <b>180</b> (and the detector <b>160</b> if the cytometer <b>200</b> includes the first analysis) to determine for each cell <b>150</b> whether the cell <b>150</b> is part of a desired sub-population of cells (e.g., sperm cells with an X chromosome). The controller <b>166</b> outputs a signal over a connection <b>206</b> to a controllable energy source <b>204</b>. The controllable energy source <b>204</b> operates in the same manner as the controllable energy source <b>196</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). However, in the embodiment depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, energy <b>208</b> emitted by the controllable energy source <b>204</b> passes through the objective lens <b>142</b> after passing, in some embodiments, through one or more optical elements, such as a filter <b>216</b>.

    <p num="p-0103">Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that multiple methods exist for creating both the focal point <b>210</b> and the focal point <b>178</b> using the same lens. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts one method that the cytometer <b>200</b> could employ to create the focal point <b>178</b> for the energy <b>176</b> and the focal point <b>210</b> for the energy <b>212</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts that as the energy <b>176</b> (indicated by solid lines in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) passes through a lens <b>214</b> of the objective lens <b>142</b> (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) from the focal point <b>178</b> (i.e., from the cell <b>150</b> at the point <b>170</b>), the lens <b>214</b> acts on the energy <b>176</b> such that the rays of energy <b>176</b> are parallel as they leave the lens <b>214</b>. By contrast, the rays of energy <b>208</b> are converging slightly as they fall incident upon the lens <b>214</b> and, accordingly, converge at the focal point <b>210</b> after passing through the lens <b>214</b>. Of course, other methods exist for creating both the focal point <b>178</b> and the focal point <b>210</b>, including taking advantage of the fact that different wavelengths of energy may refract differently through the same material, or employing multi-focal lenses such as, by way of example and not limitation, those described in U.S. Pat.

    <p num="p-0104">For illustrative purposes, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts another exemplary embodiment of a sorting flow cytometer <b>220</b>. The sorting flow cytometer <b>220</b> includes the flow path <b>110</b> as generally described with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. Similarly to the sorting flow cytometer <b>200</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the sorting flow cytometer <b>220</b> omits the first analysis (as well as equipment associated with the first analysis). The sample flow <b>123</b> and, in particular, the cells <b>150</b>, flow toward the objective lens <b>142</b>. As in previously-described embodiments, the objective lens <b>142</b> creates a focal point <b>178</b> at a point <b>170</b> in flow path <b>110</b>. The energy <b>176</b> from the cell <b>150</b> as the cell <b>150</b> reaches the point <b>170</b> passes through the objective lens <b>142</b>, which objective lens <b>142</b> is positioned such that the optical axis <b>144</b> of the objective lens <b>142</b> is generally coaxial with the sample flow <b>123</b>, and operates to focus the energy <b>176</b>. The focal point <b>178</b> of the objective lens <b>142</b> is located generally at the point <b>170</b>, but may alternatively be located so as to detect the resulting energy <b>176</b> from the cell <b>150</b> slightly after the energy <b>174</b> illuminates the cell <b>150</b>. One or more optical elements (such as the beam splitter <b>202</b>, the filter <b>186</b>, etc.) may direct the focused energy <b>182</b> from the objective lens <b>142</b> to the detector <b>180</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0105">Referring still to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the depicted sorting flow cytometer <b>220</b> includes a second analysis illumination source <b>222</b>. The second analysis illumination source <b>222</b> emits energy <b>224</b>, which may be ultraviolet energy <b>174</b>. The energy <b>224</b> emitted from the second analysis illumination source <b>222</b> travels through an optical path to the objective lens <b>142</b>. The objective lens <b>142</b> may focus the energy <b>224</b> on the focal point <b>178</b> and, in this manner, the optical paths of the energy <b>176</b> and the energy <b>224</b> may overlap to some degree. Various arrangements of other optical elements, such as the beam splitter <b>202</b> and a filter <b>226</b> may operate to direct the energy <b>224</b> from the second analysis illumination source <b>222</b> to the objective lens, and to direct the energy <b>176</b> (from the cell <b>150</b>) from the objective lens <b>142</b> to the detector <b>180</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0106">The controller <b>166</b>, as described above with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, operates to interpret signals received (via the connection <b>184</b>) from the detector <b>180</b> (and the detector <b>160</b> if the cytometer <b>200</b> includes the first analysis) to determine for each cell <b>150</b> whether the cell <b>150</b> is part of a desired sub-population of cells. The controller <b>166</b> outputs a signal over a connection <b>230</b> to a controllable energy source <b>228</b>. The controllable energy source <b>228</b> operates in the same manner as the controllable energy source <b>196</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), outputting energy <b>232</b> directed at a point <b>234</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0107"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> depict portions <b>235</b>A and <b>235</b>B, respectively, of still other embodiments of a flow cytometer in accordance with the contemplated methods and apparatus. In each of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, cells <b>236</b> travel in a stream <b>237</b> through a flow path <b>238</b>, which flow path <b>238</b> changes trajectory at or around a point <b>239</b>, as described with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Fluidics modeling of and/or precise formation of the flow path <b>238</b> and/or the stream <b>237</b> of cells <b>236</b> through the flow path <b>238</b>, and/or the inclusion of additional elements (not shown) to monitor the position of cells <b>236</b>, may ameliorate uncertainty otherwise caused by the change in trajectory at or around the point <b>239</b>. In this way, the position and identity of individual cells may remain determinable after the trajectory change. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> depicts an embodiment in which a controllable energy source <b>240</b>, operating in the same manner as described above with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b> (<b>196</b>, <b>204</b>, and <b>228</b>, respectively) is positioned such that emitted energy <b>241</b> falls incident upon cells <b>236</b> after the cells <b>236</b>, travel past the point <b>239</b> in the flow path <b>238</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> depicts the energy <b>241</b> traveling perpendicularly to the direction in which the cells <b>236</b> flow through the flow path <b>238</b>. Of course, one may appreciate that the controllable energy source <b>240</b> may alternatively be positioned such that the emitted energy <b>241</b> travels generally coaxially with the direction in which the cells <b>236</b> flow through the flow path <b>238</b> (e.g., by again changing the flow direction, and positioning the controllable energy source <b>240</b> such that the cells <b>236</b> in the flow path <b>238</b> travel toward the controllable energy source <b>240</b>).</p>
    <p num="p-0108">It should be appreciated that a sorting flow cytometer in accordance with the contemplated methods and apparatus may alternatively employ a âjet-in-airâ configuration, as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> depicts a nozzle <b>242</b> emitting a stream <b>243</b> of droplets <b>244</b>. A controllable energy source (not shown) selectively alters droplets by imparting a charge to one or more of the droplets <b>244</b>. Thereafter, and by way of example and not limitation, a pair of electrically charged plates <b>245</b> may sort the stream <b>243</b> of droplets <b>244</b> into receptacles <b>246</b> according to a determination by a detector (not shown), as described above.</p>
    <p num="p-0109"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> depicts the objective lens <b>142</b> and a portion of the flow path <b>110</b> that includes the interrogation region <b>128</b>. As generally known in the art, one or more lens elements <b>250</b> (e.g., a hemispherical front lens, a meniscus lens, etc.) act to create a nominal focal point <b>252</b>. In the embodiments described above with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, the nominal focal point <b>252</b> is within the sample flow <b>123</b> and, in particular, within the path of the cells <b>150</b> through the flow path <b>110</b>. The nominal focal point <b>252</b> defines the apex of a generally conical volume <b>254</b> between the nominal focal point <b>252</b> and an outer element <b>256</b> of the objective lens <b>142</b> forming a base <b>253</b> of the conical volume <b>254</b>. The conical volume <b>254</b> may be a right circular conical volume, but may also be an oblique conical volume. An axis <b>258</b> of the cone is generally coaxial with an axis <b>260</b> of the objective lens <b>142</b> in embodiments in which the conical volume <b>254</b> is a right circular conical volume. In such embodiments, the axes <b>258</b> and <b>260</b> are further coaxial with an axis of flow <b>262</b> within the flow path <b>110</b>, which axis of flow <b>262</b> generally defines the path that the cells <b>150</b> travel within the flow path <b>110</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0110">In some embodiments, the focal point <b>252</b> of the objective lens <b>142</b> is such that the number of interfaces through which the lateral surface <b>264</b> of the conical volume <b>254</b> passes is minimized. For example, and with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, flow path wall <b>268</b>A forms the a generally cylindrical transverse flow path <b>270</b>A, and flow path wall <b>268</b>B forms a generally cylindrical flow path <b>270</b>B that is generally coaxial with the axis of the conical volume <b>254</b>. The conical volume <b>254</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> passes through only two interfaces as it enters and exits the material comprising the wall <b>268</b>A. The conical volume <b>254</b> passes through an interface <b>272</b> between air <b>276</b> and the material comprising the wall <b>268</b>A, and through an interface <b>274</b> between the material comprising the wall <b>268</b>A and fluid <b>278</b> in the flow path <b>110</b>. Moreover, in some embodiments, the wall <b>268</b>A of the flow path <b>110</b> through which the lateral surface <b>264</b> passes may be generally parallel to the base <b>253</b> of the conical volume <b>254</b>. This simplifies the interfaces through which the energy focused by the objective lens <b>142</b> must pass (i.e., the energy does not pass through any curvilinear surfaces), each of which interfaces may, by operation of refraction, affect the focal point <b>252</b> of the objective lens <b>142</b>. Further, the conical volume <b>254</b> may be formed of sections <b>255</b>A, <b>255</b>B, and <b>255</b>C of multiple cones <b>257</b>, <b>259</b>, and <b>261</b> joined together, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, such as is the case where one or more interfaces (such as the interfaces <b>272</b> and <b>274</b>) are formed of materials having differing refractive indices.</p>
    <p num="p-0111">Generally, the conical volume <b>254</b> must pass through at least the two interfaces <b>272</b> and <b>274</b>. In some embodiments of the described methods and apparatus, the objective lens <b>142</b> may take account of one or more of the interfaces, for example by accounting for a thickness and refractive index of the material forming the interfaces (e.g., the wall <b>268</b>A). Moreover, in some embodiments, the objective lens <b>142</b> may be a water-dipping, water-immersion, or oil-immersion lens, which uses an immersion medium (e.g., water or oil) having a refractive index similar to that of the material forming the interface (e.g., the wall <b>268</b>A). Thus, as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, some embodiments further reduce distortion of the focal point <b>252</b> by minimizing differences between the respective refractive indices of the materials through which the conical volume <b>254</b> passes. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, for example, the conical volume <b>254</b> may pass through water <b>280</b>, the wall <b>268</b>A, and the fluid <b>278</b> in the flow path <b>110</b>. The objective lens <b>142</b> may be a water-immersion objective lens where, for example, the wall <b>268</b>A is made of glass. Alternatively, the objective lens <b>142</b> may be a water-dipping lens in situations in which there is no need to correct for refraction caused by the wall <b>268</b>A, such as when the wall <b>268</b>A is formed of a material with a refractive index similar to or the same as the fluid <b>278</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0112">In still further embodiments, and as described fully in concurrently-filed application Ser. No. 12/495,437, the walls <b>268</b>A and <b>268</b>B of the flow path <b>110</b> may be formed of material having a refractive index close to that of the fluid <b>278</b> (i.e., a material that minimizes the difference between refractive indices of the materials through which the conical volume <b>254</b> passes). For example, materials having a refractive index close to that of water include materials with a refractive index in the range of 1.30 to 1.40, inclusive. Several solid materials in the families of amorphous perfluoropolymers, amorphous fluoropolymers, and perfluoroalkoxy polymers have refractive indices in that range. By way of example and not limitation, Cytopâ¢, manufactured by Asahi Glass Co., Ltd., and TeflonÂ® AF and TeflonÂ® PFA, manufactured by DuPontâ¢, are three such materials.</p>
    <p num="p-0113">In some embodiments, the methods or apparatus may also adjust the refractive index of the fluid <b>278</b> such that the refractive index of the fluid <b>278</b> is closer to the refractive index of the material forming the walls <b>268</b>A and/or <b>268</b>B of the flow path <b>110</b>. In particular, the methods or apparatus may adjust the refractive index of the fluid <b>278</b> to be within 0.02 of the refractive index of the material forming the walls <b>268</b>A and/or <b>268</b>B of the flow path <b>110</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0114">In some cytometers, a portion of the flow path <b>110</b>, including the interrogation region <b>128</b>, is formed in a body <b>280</b>, such as the body <b>280</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> depicts the body <b>280</b> as a rectangular cuboid, having drilled or otherwise formed therein a portion <b>281</b> of the flow path <b>110</b>. The portion <b>281</b> includes a first flow path portion <b>282</b> generally perpendicular to a surface <b>284</b> through which the objective lens <b>142</b> may observe, and a second flow path portion <b>286</b> generally parallel to the surface <b>284</b> and intersecting an end <b>288</b> of the first flow path section <b>282</b> nearest the surface <b>284</b>. The body <b>280</b>, which may, for example, be a cuvette, may be formed of polished quartz, glass, plastic, or other materials as generally known in the art. In some embodiments, the body <b>280</b> may be formed, in whole or in part, of a material having a refractive index in the range of 1.30 to 1.40, inclusive, such as Cytopâ¢ or TeflonÂ® AF.</p>
    <p num="p-0115">In another embodiment, illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the body <b>280</b> includes the portion <b>281</b> of the flow path. The portion <b>281</b> includes the first flow path portion <b>282</b> generally perpendicular to the surface <b>284</b> through which the objective lens <b>142</b> may observe. However, in the embodiment depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the second flow path portion <b>286</b> forms a channel having an upper edge <b>290</b> generally coplanar with the surface <b>284</b>. A coverslip <b>292</b> disposed on top of the surface <b>284</b> may, in some embodiments, allow the use of an objective lens corrected for use with such a coverslip <b>292</b> to eliminate or minimize the refractive effects of interfaces between materials with differing refractive indices.</p>
    <p num="p-0116">In still other embodiments, such as that depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the body <b>280</b> includes a reservoir <b>294</b> formed at the intersection of first flow path portion <b>282</b> and the second flow path portion <b>286</b>. For example, the first flow path portion <b>282</b> may intersect the reservoir <b>294</b> at a generally planar bottom surface <b>296</b> that is generally parallel to the surface <b>284</b>. Two parts <b>286</b>A and <b>286</b>B of the flow path portion <b>286</b> may connect to the reservoir <b>294</b> at opposing surfaces of the reservoir <b>294</b>, which may generally have the shape of a flattened cylinder. This arrangement may provide further flexibility when adjusting the focal point <b>252</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>) by, for example, preventing the conical volume <b>254</b> from passing through the wall <b>268</b>A of the generally cylindrical transverse flow path <b>270</b>A (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>).</p>
    <p num="p-0117"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> depicts a similar embodiment in which a top edge <b>298</b> of the reservoir <b>294</b> is coplanar with the surface <b>284</b> of the body <b>280</b>. A water-dipping objective lens (not shown) may extend into the reservoir <b>294</b> and, in doing so, may be in contact with fluid flowing through the flow path <b>110</b>, which may eliminate any interfaces between materials of differing refractive indices.</p>
    <p num="p-0118"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> depicts yet another embodiment, in which a coverslip <b>299</b> is placed over the exposed reservoir depicted in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0119"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates a method <b>300</b> of selecting a desired sub-population of cells from a sample of cells. In some embodiments, the method <b>300</b>, or portions thereof, is stored in a memory as a set of machine-readable instructions making up a control routine for one or more associated apparatus. A processor may read the instructions from the memory and execute the instructions to perform the method <b>300</b>. In another embodiment, the method <b>300</b> includes several routines, which routines may individually control one or more apparatus, may analyze data collected by the one or more apparatus, may make one or more determinations based on the analyzed data, etc. As generally known, a technician or apparatus may label (e.g., by applying a Hoechst stain) a specimen for analysis (e.g., a collection of sperm cells) (block <b>305</b>). Labeling the cells may be accomplished within a sorting flow cytometer, or in a separate process or procedure outside of the sorting flow cytometer. Moreover, the particular label applied to the cells may depend upon the cytometric application.</p>
    <p num="p-0120">In any event, after labeling the cells, a sorting flow cytometer may create a flow of sheath fluid in a flow path (block <b>310</b>). Through a separate input, the sorting flow cytometer may inject a specimen (i.e., the labeled cells) into the flow path (block <b>315</b>), preferably at or near the center of the flow of sheath fluid. Also preferably, the specimen enters the flow of sheath fluid slowly relative to the flow of sheath fluid, such that the cells within the specimen (e.g., the sperm cells) align with a long axis parallel to the flow of sheath fluid, and such that the cells flow in a generally single-file pattern.</p>
    <p num="p-0121">As the cells move through the flow path, an excitation energy source, such as a UV laser, illuminates the specimen (block <b>320</b>). The excitation energy source may continually illuminate the flow path, or a routine executing on the processor may control the excitation energy source to illuminate the flow path selectively (e.g., only when a specimen is present in the flow path).</p>
    <p num="p-0122">An objective lens or other focusing means operates to focus energy emitted, transmitted, or reflected from each cell (e.g., fluorescent light emitted by the label) in a direction coaxial to the flow (block <b>325</b>). That is, the combined sheath flow and specimen within the flow path move generally toward an objective lens having an optical axis that is generally coaxial with the flow and, nominally, each cell within the specimen passes through a focal point of the objective lens. A detector receives the focused energy from the objective lens (block <b>330</b>), and sends a signal representative of the detected energy to a controller. In some embodiments, the detector may detect individually the focused energy from more than 40,000 cells per second, may detect individually the focused energy from more than 75,000 cells per second, or may detect individually the focused energy from more than 100,000 cells per second.</p>
    <p num="p-0123">The controller receives the signal representative of the detected energy and analyzes the data (block <b>335</b>) to determine (at block <b>340</b>) whether the data represent a cell within the desired sub-population, a cell not within the desired sub-population, or an indeterminate cell which can neither be determined to be in the desired sub-population nor be determined not to be in the desired sub-population. In the latter case, the controller may treat the cell as though the detector determined that the cell was not in desired sub-population. If the controller determines that the cell is not in the desired sub-population or is indeterminate, the controller may send a signal to a controllable energy source, such as an infrared laser, to irradiate the cell (e.g., to alter the cell, destroy the cell, render the cell non-viable, etc.) (block <b>345</b>). Alternatively, if the controller determines that the cell is in the desired sub-population, the controller may send a signal to the controllable energy source (or refrain from sending a signal) such that the controllable energy source does not irradiate the cell (block <b>350</b>).</p>
    <p num="p-0124">The apparatus may collect the cells for use and/or further processing (e.g., separating the cells) at the end of the process. In some embodiments, which may include the embodiment depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the controller sends a signal to the controllable energy source to leave unaltered (i.e., not to irradiate) cells determined to be in the desired sub-population, and the resulting collection of processed cells comprises a ratio of cells in the desired sub-population of cells to total unaltered cells greater than or equal to 60%. Further, in some embodiments, which may include the embodiment depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the controller sends a signal to the controllable energy source to leave unaltered (i.e., not to irradiate) cells determined to be in the desired sub-population, and the resulting collection of processed cells comprises a ratio of altered cells in the desired sub-population to total cells in the desired sub-population less than or equal to 50%.</p>
    <p num="p-0125">Of course, the method described above reflects one or more embodiments of the presently described methods, but may also encompass one or more additional steps or routines, as described throughout this specification with respect to various embodiments. Moreover, some embodiments may omit one or more of the steps or routines described with reference to method <b>300</b>. By way of example and not limitation, in some embodiments, the label may auto-fluoresce, thereby eliminating the need to illuminate the specimen with an illumination energy source. Further, in some embodiments (as described above), the method may reverse blocks <b>345</b> and <b>350</b>, allowing cells determined not to be in the desired sub-population to pass without irradiation by the controllable energy source, while causing the controllable energy source to irradiate cells determined to be in the desired sub-population.</p>
    <p num="p-0126">The methods and apparatus provide a number of important advantages over currently implemented sorting flow cytometers. As one advantage, the presently described methods and apparatus do not subject the analyte cells, which in some embodiments are mammalian sperm cells, to the jet-in-air configuration commonly used in sorting flow cytometers. The result is that a cytometer according to the presently described embodiments does not expose the analyte cells to the environment outside of the cytometer or the resulting collision of the sorted droplet with a receptacle, and do not experience the pressures and pressure changes associated with a nozzle of the jet-in-air configuration. This allows use of the cytometer outside of an environment that implements strict conditions of air quality and temperature control (e.g., outside of a âclean roomâ environment). In fact, the cytometer itself may implement temperature control to extend the viability of the analyte cells. Moreover, the presently described methods and apparatus may detect and alter the analyte cells faster and/or more accurately, in part because the generally coaxial alignment of the objective lens with the flow of the analyte through the interrogation area mitigates and/or eliminates the problems associated with the anisotropic emission of energy from the analyte, particularly in embodiments used to sort many types of mammalian sperm cells. Having read the present description of the methods and apparatus disclosed herein, other advantages of the presently described methods and apparatus will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
