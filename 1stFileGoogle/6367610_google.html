    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>(1) Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>The present invention relates generally to package sorting conveyors and more particularly relates to a sorting conveyor having greatly improved energy efficiency.</p>
    <p>(2) Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p>Conveyor systems having a number of individual carrying carts have been commonly used for many years to carry and sort packages or other items, such as mail. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,054,601 to Sjogren et al. discloses a package sorting conveyor comprised of a train of tilt tray carriers coupled in tandem to form a continuous loop. Each carrier includes a pivotally mounted tilt tray normally maintained in an upright position. The carriers are moved around the loop by a series of motors spaced around the loop. Branching out from the loop are outfeed chutes or the like for receiving packages from the carriers. When a particular carrier holding a particular package to be sorted reaches a selected outfeed chute, an actuator tilts the tray to dump the package into the outfeed chute. Another example of a typical package sorting conveyor is disclosed in International PCT Application Number PCT/DK90/00047 of Kosan Crisplant A/S, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,664,660.</p>
    <p>One significant disadvantage of conventionally designed package sorting conveyors is that conventional conveyor carriers laterally tilt only on a horizontal axis parallel to the direction of conveyor travel. While this accomplishes the objective of dumping the package from the carrier into an outfeed chute or the like, the package is often roughly tumbled or rolled, sometimes damaging the package's contents. One reason for this is that the packages typically are unloaded from the carrier while still traveling forward at the same speed as the conveyor. Thus, packages tend to slam into a forward retaining wall of the outfeed chute before sliding down the chute. Another problem with conventional laterally tilting conveyors is that because the packages are moving forward at full speed when they are unloaded into the outfeed chute, the outfeed chute must be relatively wide so that packages do not miss the chute and fall off the conveyor past the chute. This often unnecessarily increases the overall size of the conveyor system.</p>
    <p>U.S. Pat. No. 4,744,454 and an improvement thereto, U.S. Pat. No. 5,086,905, both to Pölling, disclose previous attempts to remedy this problem of rough handling by conventional laterally tilting conveyor carriers. Both of these patents to Pölling disclose a conveyor element for a package conveyor that includes a tilting carrier tray mounted to be rotatable about two swivel axes. A first swivel shaft extends obliquely downward from the underside of the carrying tray and is in turn connected at an angle to the end of a second swivel shaft extending obliquely upwards from a base support part of the conveyor element. Together, the two swivel shafts form a “V” that points in the direction of conveyor travel. Both of the swivel shafts lie in the vertical plane of symmetry of the conveyor element when the carrier tray is disposed in its upright position.</p>
    <p>Because the carrier tray of Pölling rotates about two oblique axes, the carrier tray can be tilted not only lateral on a horizontal axis, but is moved through a geometrically complex spatial reorientation during package discharge. This allows for more gentle placement of a package on an outfeed chute than can be accomplished using conventional conveyor trays that laterally tip on only a horizontal axis. The Pölling conveyor element more gently handles the packages by imparting some degree of rearward velocity to the packages as they are discharged, which, when added to the forward velocity of the conveyor system, results in the packages' forward velocity during discharge being less than that of the conveyor system itself.</p>
    <p>However, the conveyor elements of both of Pölling's patents are unduly complicated and intolerant of manufacturing discrepancies. In fact, the second Pölling conveyor element (U.S. Pat. No. 5,086,905) was invented in an attempt to simplify the original design disclosed in the first Pölling patent (U.S. Pat. No. 4,744,454), which had proved to be too expensive and complicated to manufacture efficiently. As a result of this complexity and cost, the Pölling devices have not enjoyed significant commercial acceptance and success.</p>
    <p>One solution to these problems is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,836,436, issued Nov. 17, 1998 and co-owned by the assignee of the present invention, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. One feature of this reference is the use of a pull-down design for tilting the improve trays.</p>
    <p>Another example of a sorter conveyor using a pull-down design for tilting its trays is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,664,660, issued to Prydtz. The '660 patent is directed to a sorter conveyor having laterally tiltable transport trays, instead of a conventional transport chain driven by a driving station, in which a driving wheel or worm cooperates with the chain links, these being advanced arranged with guiding rails along a small mutual spacing and carrying both the transport trays and the tilt mechanisms associated therewith, which conventional arrangement causes considerable problems with respect to tolerances for both the longitudinal pitch of the chain links and the mounting of the guiding rails. The invention includes carts that are advanced along mutually widely spaced guiding rails, whereby the tolerance demands on the latter are reduced considerably. Also, the carts are advanced by way of stationary linear motors, which, supposedly, renders any tolerance demands on the longitudinal pitch of the tray units entirely superfluous. Also the tilting mechanisms may be given a very simple design according to the patent. However, it has been discovered that there are operational problems associated with this type of design, especially the operation of its linear motors and tilting mechanism.</p>
    <p>While the design shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,836,436 overcomes some of the problems associated with the prior art designs, some problems have begun to surface over time as the units have been operated. One of these problems is when there is a mis-tip which causes “cascading errors.”</p>
    <p>“Cascading errors” were first discovered when audits at the end of the chute indicated there were more errors occurring than were predicted by errors indicating by tray verification. Normally, when a tray is to tip to the right immediately before the tray is being straightened, a series of photocells determines if the right hand arm is in the “low” or “tipped” position, or the “up” or “latched” position. If the controls said that the arm should be tipped and the verifier says that the arm is tipped then it was assumed that the product went down the correct chute. However, in certain cases, tray verification would predict five errors but chute audits would indicate 35 errors. This previously unknown effect is referred to in this application as “cascade errors.”</p>
    <p>Most pull-down tilting mechanisms are actuated by spring when the pivot switch is released by an energizing solenoid. In other words, the pivot switch is spring-biased in the “out” position but held in the retained position by the solenoid.</p>
    <p>When the computer provides a pulse, the solenoid plunger retracts, enabling the pivot switch to spring into the “out” position. The wheel strikes the pivot switch in front of the pivot point and the pivot switch unlatches the carriage and then as the wheel strikes the tail of the pivot switch, it pushes the pivot switch back to the home position and the spring on the solenoid plunger pushes the plunger into a detent capturing the pivot switch in the home position. The computer initiates the unlatch but it is the action of the wheel on the tail that normally relatches it.</p>
    <p>If the solenoid does not return to capture the pivot switch before the wheel leaves the pivot switch's tail or a wheel is missing or broken, this will allow the pivot switch to move away from its intended home position back into the engagement position. The next tilt module that is not in the down position will then strike the pivot switch, tilt, and reset the pivot switch. If the pivot switch relatches properly this time, then that particular pivot switch will cause no more errors. If the pivot switch does not relatch it can again go into the engaged position and cause additional problems.</p>
    <p>The cascade effect, though, comes from the first carriage that was tipped incorrectly, for if it were assigned a tilt position further downstream, when that carriage (which has been tilted incorrectly) gets in position to unload, the pivot switch at the proper destination chute will move into the engagement position. But because that arm has been incorrectly tipped upstream, no action will take place and the pivot switch will stay in the out position until the next untipped carriage arrives. That carriage will then be tipped at the wrong destination but should cause that pivot switch to relatch. If that particular tray was assigned a chute destination further downstream, when it arrives at its proper destination, the pivot switch will move into the engagement position, but again cannot engage because the tilt module is already in the low position, the tilt module will pass by and will not relatch the pivot switch. This pivot switch will then stay in the out position capturing the wheel of the next tilt module that is not tipped. This error will than continue to cascade downstream until eventually the error will pass the last destination and the system should heal itself.</p>
    <p>However, there are some conditions that can exist that cause the error not to heal itself but continue to cause problems. An example would be if a particular tilt module were missing a wheel; that tilt module could then be loaded and when it gets to its destination, the pivot switch will go out to engage the wheel but with no wheel the module will not tip. The pivot switch will then catch the next available tray beginning the cascade problem. This will continue to repeat itself and will occur and start cascade error any time the tray with the missing wheel is assigned a destination.</p>
    <p>One attempted solution to this problem is to use the tip verification switch to shut the sorter down if the pivot switch does not return to the “home” position within a given time period. However, with a large sorter this requires a maintenance man to then check the pivot switch to see if it should be reset and whether a wheel is missing. In the meantime, everything just sits on the sorter. For time critical applications, such as airline baggage sorting, this delay may be unacceptable.</p>
    <p>One solution to these problems is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,009,992, issued Jan. 4, 2000 and also owned by the assignee of the present invention, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. One feature of this reference is the use of a powered up and powered down bi-directional pivot switch.</p>
    <p>However, most of these designs are based around linear induction motors (LIMs) which are well accepted today due to their quietness and low maintenance. Unfortunately, for all their advantages LIMs are not very energy efficient. For example, pairs of LIMs, spaced at 80 feet intervals and operated at 480 volts, draws about 15 amps. This is about 90 watts per foot of sorter for about 70 pounds of thrust. To the contrary, prior art chain drives would draw about 15 watts per foot of sorter for about 1500 pounds of thrust. Thus, the modern LIM drives, for all their other advantages, are energy hogs. However, prior art, mechanical chain drives are just too noisy and high maintenance for today's market.</p>
    <p>Thus, there remains a need for a new and improved sorting conveyor that is substantially as energy efficient as conventional chain drives while, at the same time, is mechanically as quiet and maintenance-free as the modern LIM drives.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention is directed to an improved sorting conveyor for transporting objects and unloading objects at one or more unloading stations adjacent the conveyor. Generally, the sorting conveyor includes: a conveyor track; a train of the tilting conveyor carts connected end-to-end; and an opposed roller motor assembly for moving the conveyor carts on the conveyor track. In the preferred embodiment, the opposed roller motor assembly includes a pair of cantilevered, generally cylindrical rollers on each side of an extended driven member attached to each conveyor cart.</p>
    <p>Each of the tilting conveyor carts includes a trailer frame base. The trailer frame includes a roller structure for engaging the conveyor track, a driven member responsive to the opposed roller motor assembly, and a hitch mechanism for connecting each tilting conveyor cart to an adjacent conveyor cart. The conveyor cart also includes a carrying tray for holding the objects and a tiltable support apparatus for supporting the carrying tray above the trailer frame base and for allowing tilting of the carrying tray towards at least one side of the conveyor to unload objects into unloading stations on at least one side of the conveyor.</p>
    <p>The tilting mechanism tilts the carrying tray on the tiltable support apparatus to thereby unload objects into one of the unloading stations adjacent the conveyor. The improved tilting mechanism includes a pair of actuating arms attached to the carrying tray on opposite sides of the tiltable support apparatus and a pull-down mechanism associated with each unloading station for selectively pulling down one of the actuating arms so as to pull one side of the carrying tray downwardly into a tilted position.</p>
    <p>In the present invention, each of the actuator arms includes a cam follower on a lower end of the actuator arm, and wherein the pull-down mechanism includes a descending ramp adjacent the conveyor track, a laterally pivoting switch for directing the cam follower of a selected actuator arm into the descending ramp and a bi-directional, rotary actuator assembly connected to the laterally pivoting switch.</p>
    <p>In the preferred embodiment, the rotary actuator assembly includes an actuator arm having a first end and a second end, the pivot switch being connected to the first end of the actuator arm; and a bi-directional actuator attached to the actuator arm second end, whereby the rotary actuator assembly is operable to rotate the laterally pivoting switch to engage the cam follower and direct the cam follower of a selected actuator arm into the descending ramp and for closing the laterally pivoting switch after capture of the cam follower.</p>
    <p>The opposed roller motor assembly preferably includes a pair of electric motors and a support frame attached to the conveyor track for supporting the motors. At least one pair of cantilevered, drive rollers are connected to each of the respective motors and adjacent to each of the surfaces of an extended fin driven member attached to each of the carts. Each drive roller offsets the mechanical load of the other drive roller.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention is to provide a sorting conveyor for transporting objects and unloading objects at one or more unloading stations adjacent the conveyor. The sorting conveyor includes: a conveyor track; a train of conveyor carts connected end-to-end; and an opposed roller motor assembly for moving the conveyor carts on the conveyor track.</p>
    <p>Another aspect of the present invention is to provide an opposed roller motor assembly for a sorting conveyor having a train of conveyor carts connected end-to-end for transporting objects and unloading objects at one or more unloading stations adjacent the conveyor. The opposed roller motor assembly includes: a motor; a support frame attached to the conveyor track for supporting the motor; at least one cantilevered, drive roller connected to the motor and adjacent to one surface of an extended fin driven member attached to each of the carts; and an opposing surface adjacent to the other surface of the extended fin driven member for off-setting the mechanical load of the drive roller.</p>
    <p>Still another aspect of the present invention is to provide a sorting conveyor for transporting objects and unloading objects at one or more unloading stations adjacent the conveyor. The sorting conveyor includes: a conveyor track; a train of conveyor carts connected end-to-end, each of the conveyor carts including: a trailer frame base, including: a roller structure for engaging the conveyor track, an extended fin driven member, and a hitch mechanism for connecting each conveyor cart to an adjacent conveyor cart; a carrying tray for holding the objects; and a tiltable support apparatus for supporting the carrying tray above the trailer frame base and for allowing tilting of the carrying tray towards at least one side of the conveyor to unload objects into unloading stations on at least one side of the conveyor; and an opposed roller motor assembly for moving the conveyor carts on the conveyor track, the roller motor assembly including: a motor; a support frame attached to the conveyor track for supporting the motor; at least one cantilevered, drive roller connected to the motor and adjacent to one surface of the extended fin driven member; and an opposing surface adjacent to the other surface of the extended fin driven member for off-setting the mechanical load of the drive roller.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p>In the following description, like reference characters designate like or corresponding parts throughout the several views. Also in the following description, it is to be understood that such terms as “forward”, “rearward”, “left”, “right”, “upwardly”, “downwardly”, and the like are words of convenience and are not to be construed as limiting terms.</p>
    <p>Referring now to the drawings in general and FIG. 1 in particular, it will be understood that the illustrations are for the purpose of describing a pre-ferred embodiment of the invention and are not intended to limit the invention thereto. As seen in FIG. 1, a sorting conveyor, generally designated <b>10</b>, is shown constructed according to the present invention for transporting and sorting packages <b>11</b> or other objects. The sorting conveyor <b>10</b> comprises a train of individual carts <b>20</b>, connected end to end, which preferably form an endless loop around a closed-circuit conveyor track <b>12</b>. Alternately, the conveyor carts <b>20</b> of the invention could be used singly or as part of a finite train.</p>
    <p>The package sorting conveyor <b>10</b> generally includes four major sub-assemblies: a conveyor track <b>12</b>; an opposed roller motor assembly <b>210</b>; the train of tilting conveyor carts <b>20</b>, which are moved along the conveyor track <b>12</b> by the opposed roller motor assembly <b>70</b>; and a tilting mechanism <b>80</b> for tilting the conveyor carts <b>20</b> to discharge packages <b>11</b> therefrom. Typically, any number of unloading stations or outfeed chutes <b>18</b>, which are adjacent the package sorting conveyor <b>10</b> on one or both sides thereof, receive the packages <b>11</b> discharged from the sorting conveyor <b>10</b> and carry the packages to waiting storage bins, trucks, etc. Packages may be manually placed on the conveyor carts <b>20</b> or may be delivered to the sorting conveyor <b>10</b> via infeed chutes <b>17</b> or the like.</p>
    <p>The conveyor track <b>12</b> includes two parallel rails <b>14</b> and may be built to conform to the layout of any warehouse, shipping center, distribution center, or the like. Best seen as resembling the track of a roller coaster, the conveyor track <b>12</b> may be substantially horizontal or may ascend and descend. The conveyor track rails <b>14</b> may lie in the same horizontal plane, or one may be higher than the other, such as would be the case in a banked curve in the track <b>12</b>. Banked curves are greatly advantageous because they allow the conveyor carts <b>20</b> to move around a curved conveyor track <b>12</b> at a much greater speed without spilling packages <b>11</b> than on a flat track. Preferably, the rails <b>14</b> are generally tubular, again similar to a roller coaster, and are supported by rail support members <b>16</b> only on the outwardly facing edges of the rails. The rails <b>14</b> may be round or rectangular in cross-section. Rectangular cross-section is preferred since it has been found that round rails cause the cam followers to wear somewhat in their center because the load is not as well distributed as when rectangular rails are utilized.</p>
    <p>The opposed roller motor assembly <b>210</b> of the sorter conveyor <b>10</b>, which is shown in FIG. 2, is preferably a pair of opposed drive roller assemblies <b>214</b>, <b>214</b>′ which is discussed in more detail in FIGS. 12 and 13. A driven fin <b>36</b>, which is attached to the bottom of each conveyor cart <b>20</b>, hangs between the two drive roller assemblies <b>214</b>, <b>214</b>′.</p>
    <p>Composed of semi-rigid, high coefficient aluminum or other conductive metal, the vertical fin <b>36</b> preferably has swept-back front <b>36</b> <i>a </i>and rear <b>36</b> <i>b </i>edges, as shown in FIG. 4, giving the fin <b>36</b> <i>a </i>generally parallelogram shape to reduce damage in the event the fin would contact a structure and to distribute the air gap over the length of the drive rollers to reduce noise and maintain more constant thrust. Specifically, because the gap is angled with respect to the roller, the roller does not hit the gap like a pot hole which is large enough for both wheels to hit at the same time.</p>
    <p>Vertically orienting the fin <b>36</b> and the opposed roller assembly <b>210</b> also reduces problems with maintaining proper spacing between the fin <b>36</b> and the drive rollers, because gravity ceases to be a factor as the weight of the live load varies. This results in the fin <b>36</b> being easily maintained equidistant between the two drive rollers.</p>
    <p>The opposed roller motor assembly <b>210</b> ordinarily moves the train of conveyor carts <b>20</b> in one direction of travel; however, it can also be reversed if necessary to to slow or stop the conveyor.</p>
    <p>Now turning to the train of tilting conveyor carts <b>20</b>, each cart <b>20</b> includes three major sub-assemblies, shown best in FIG. <b>2</b>: a trailer frame structure <b>22</b>, a generally horizontally disposed carrying tray <b>40</b> for holding the packages <b>11</b>, and a tiltable support apparatus <b>50</b> for supporting the carrying tray <b>40</b> above the trailer frame structure <b>22</b> and for allowing tilting of the carrying tray <b>40</b> towards either side of the sorting conveyor <b>10</b> to unload a package into one of the unloading stations. Each cart <b>20</b> is built around a base trailer frame structure <b>22</b> to which other components of each cart <b>20</b> are mounted. As shown in FIG. 3, the trailer frame structure <b>22</b> includes a longitudinal base member <b>24</b> that extends in the rearward direction of conveyor travel <b>64</b> between the two parallel rails <b>14</b>. Preferably, the base member <b>24</b> is substantially equidistant from each rail <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p>A roller structure <b>26</b> for riding on the conveyor track <b>12</b> is mounted on a front end of the base member <b>24</b> and includes two laterally extending cam follower mechanisms <b>27</b>, one for each rail <b>14</b>. The reason for the outboard placement of the rail supports <b>16</b> and the tubular shape of the rails <b>14</b> becomes apparent upon examining the cam follower mechanisms <b>27</b>. Each cam follower mechanism <b>27</b> includes three cam followers: an upper cam follower <b>30</b> <i>a </i>for riding on the top edge of the rail <b>14</b>, a middle cam follower <b>30</b> <i>b </i>for riding on an inside edge of the rail <b>14</b>, and a lower cam follower <b>30</b> <i>c </i>for riding on the bottom edge of the rail <b>14</b>. With this configuration, it is almost impossible for a cart <b>20</b> to jump the track <b>12</b>, because a wheel is provided for each directional force (sideways, upward, and downward) that a cart <b>20</b> may encounter when traveling along the track <b>12</b>. Preferably, each cam follower <b>30</b> <i>a,b,c </i>is constructed of a somewhat resilient material such as polyurethane to provide for smooth, quiet, relatively vibration-free operation of the sorter conveyor <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring now especially to FIGS. 3A and 3B, the structure of each cam follower mechanism <b>27</b> that holds the top wheel <b>30</b> <i>a </i>is shown in greater detail. Each top cam follower <b>30</b> <i>a </i>is retained by an axle caster <b>28</b> that is preferably formed from extruded aluminum or the like. The axle caster <b>28</b> includes two forks <b>28</b> <i>a </i>and <b>28</b> <i>b, </i>one on each side of the wheel <b>30</b> <i>a, </i>and a bearing bore <b>28</b> <i>c </i>disposed at the juncture of the two forks <b>28</b> <i>a,b, </i>which has an opening <b>28</b> <i>d </i>on one side so that the bearing bore <b>28</b> <i>c </i>communicates with the space between the forks <b>28</b> <i>a,b. </i>A pair of flange bearings <b>29</b> seated in the bearing bore <b>28</b> <i>c </i>are disposed around an axle shaft <b>27</b> <i>a </i>extending from the roller structure <b>26</b>. Preferably formed of “oilite” or other friction-reducing material, each flange bearing <b>29</b> has the form of a top-hat bushing and includes a center hole <b>29</b> <i>a </i>through which passes the axle shaft <b>27</b> <i>a. </i>The cam follower <b>30</b> <i>a </i>is held in place between the two forks <b>28</b> <i>a,b </i>by a bolt <b>31</b> and nut <b>31</b> <i>a. </i>Preferably, the cam follower <b>30</b> <i>a </i>includes a bearing structure <b>30</b> <i>d </i>disposed around the bolt <b>31</b>, which serves as an axle running through the center of the wheel <b>30</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p>The axle caster shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B represents an improvement over existing axle casters that hold cam followers. Due to wear, axle casters inevitably tend to become loose and allow the cam followers to chatter back and forth, which would inhibit smooth, quiet, vibration-free operation of a sorting conveyor. However, previously designed axle casters typically have a bearing around the axle shaft that must be pressed out when worn and replaced with a new bearing that must be pressed in. This requires a press in addition to more time and expense than is desirable in a large sorting conveyor system.</p>
    <p>The axle caster <b>28</b> of the present invention solves this problem by providing that the flange bearings <b>29</b> can easily be slid into place by hand into the bearing bore <b>28</b> <i>c </i>without using a press. Then, to immovably secure the flange bearings <b>29</b> inside the bearing bore <b>28</b> <i>c, </i>the forks <b>28</b> <i>a,b </i>are slightly flexed inwardly towards each other as the nut <b>31</b> <i>a </i>is tightened onto the bolt <b>31</b> to hold the wheel <b>30</b> <i>a </i>in place. The forks <b>28</b> <i>a,b </i>of the axle caster <b>28</b> are therefore formed minutely wider apart than would be necessary to merely hold the wheel <b>30</b> <i>a. </i>When the forks <b>28</b> <i>a,b </i>are flexed inwardly towards each other by tightening the nut <b>31</b> <i>a </i>on the bolt <b>31</b>, the opening <b>28</b> <i>d </i>of the bearing bore <b>28</b> <i>c </i>is closed somewhat and the bearing bore <b>28</b> <i>c </i>is itself slightly distorted, securely retaining the flange bearings <b>29</b> therein. The flange bearings <b>29</b> themselves are, however, not significantly distorted and are free to swivel back and forth on the axle shaft <b>27</b> <i>a. </i>Therefore, the flange bearings <b>29</b> can easily and immediately be replaced on-site when worn, eliminating much down-time that would be required if conventionally designed axle casters were used in the conveyor cart <b>20</b> of the present invention.</p>
    <p>Adjacent carts <b>20</b> in the train are connected together using hitch mechanisms <b>32</b>. Each hitch mechanism <b>32</b> is shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 as including a front hitch <b>32</b> <i>a </i>mounted on the front end of the base member <b>24</b> in front of the roller structure <b>26</b> and a rear hitch <b>32</b> <i>b </i>mounted on the rear end of the base member. In the embodiment disclosed, each hitch <b>32</b> <i>a,b </i>has a vertical throughbore, through which a hitch pin connector <b>32</b> <i>c </i>is inserted. Preferably, the hitch mechanisms <b>32</b> are configured so that the front hitch <b>32</b> <i>a </i>on a rearward cart is disposed overtop of the rear hitch <b>32</b> <i>b </i>on a forward cart. In the alternative, the hitch mechanisms <b>32</b> may comprise a poly-directional spherical ball joint mechanism similar in structure to an automotive trailer hitch. In either case, friction between hitch mechanism components is preferably reduced by, for example, lining the hitch components with TEFLON or other relatively friction-free material.</p>
    <p>To prevent adjacent conveyor carts <b>20</b> from separating should the hitch mechanism <b>32</b> accidentally break or become uncoupled, an auxiliary cart connector <b>34</b> is preferably connected between the trailer frame structures <b>22</b> of adjacent carts <b>20</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the auxiliary cart connector <b>34</b> is a metal cable or lanyard, although other high-tensile strength materials could be used. In the embodiment depicted, the auxiliary cart connector <b>34</b> is an approximately {fraction (3/16)}th inch thick metal cable connected to adjacent trailer frame structures <b>22</b> with metal mounting connectors <b>34</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p>The primary reason that metal is the preferred material for the auxiliary cart connector <b>34</b>, besides its strength, is so that the auxiliary cart connector <b>34</b> will also serve as a continuous electrical connector between adjacent carts <b>20</b>. Electrical continuity between carts <b>20</b> is important because of static electricity build-up while the carts <b>20</b> are traveling around the conveyor track <b>12</b>. However, because the cam followers <b>30</b> <i>a,b,c </i>are preferably formed of polyurethane (an electrical insulator) and because the components of the hitch mechanism <b>32</b> are preferably coated with TEFLON (also an electrical insulator), electrical continuity between adjacent carts <b>20</b> would not otherwise be effectively achieved. By electrically connecting the carts <b>20</b>, static charges can be bled off from the train, which is important for safety and operational considerations. Thus, the auxiliary cart connector <b>34</b> serves two important purposes: first, it physically attaches two adjacent conveyor carts <b>20</b> and prevents them from becoming completely separated should the hitch mechanism <b>32</b> fail; second, it enables electrical continuity among all of the conveyor carts <b>20</b> in the train.</p>
    <p>The configuration of the conveyor cart <b>20</b> of the present invention, with its forwardly mounted roller structure <b>26</b>, particularly structured hitch mechanism <b>32</b>, and swept-back fin <b>36</b> is a significant improvement over previously designed conveyor carts. In conventional conveyor carts, the roller structures are typically mounted at the rear end of the trailer frame and the rear hitch is disposed overtop of the forward hitch. When a hitch mechanism breaks or becomes accidentally uncoupled with this old configuration, the result is that the forward end of the trailer frame drops below the conveyor track and is pushed over underlying structures or the floor. As this uncoupled cart contacts the surrounding permanent structures, the force exerted by the mass and acceleration of the carts leads to inevitable damage to the sorter carts, the conveyor track, and the surrounding structure. This occurrence is similar to a railroad train becoming derailed from the tracks causing massive damage to the individual carts, the railroad track and any surrounding structure that the train contacts.</p>
    <p>With the present design, even without the auxiliary connector cable <b>34</b>, only the rear end of the trailer frame structure <b>22</b> will drop below the conveyor track <b>12</b> upon accidental disengagement of the hitches <b>32</b> <i>a,b </i>or upon breakage of the hitch mechanism <b>32</b>. Therefore, instead of the front end <b>36</b> <i>a </i>of the driven fin <b>36</b> digging into the floor sides or underlying structures below the conveyor, as is the case with prior art conveyors, the driven fin <b>36</b> will simply be dragged with relatively minimal damage should one of the hitches <b>32</b> break or become accidentally uncoupled. If an auxiliary connector cable <b>34</b> is attached between two adjacent carts <b>20</b> that break apart, the connector cable <b>34</b> will limit the distance that the rear end of the trailer frame structure <b>22</b> will drop, further limiting damage.</p>
    <p>Mounted atop the trailer frame structure <b>22</b> of each conveyor cart <b>20</b> is the tiltable support apparatus <b>50</b>, which supports the carrying tray <b>40</b> thereabove. As can best be seen in FIG. 5, the tiltable support apparatus <b>50</b> generally includes three components: an upper support structure <b>52</b> joined to a bottom surface of the carrying tray <b>40</b>, a lower support structure <b>58</b> centrally mounted atop the longitudinal base member <b>24</b>, and an angled pivot structure <b>60</b> pivotally connecting the lower support structure <b>58</b> to the upper support structure <b>52</b> along a pivot axis <b>62</b>.</p>
    <p>In turn, the upper support structure <b>52</b> includes a front support member <b>54</b> and a back support member <b>56</b>. The lower support structure <b>58</b> is preferably generally planar, lying in the vertical plane parallel to the conveyor line of travel <b>64</b>, and includes an angled upper edge <b>58</b> <i>a. </i>The pivot structure <b>60</b> preferably includes an axle <b>68</b> that runs either through or along the upper edge <b>58</b> <i>a </i>of the lower support structure <b>58</b> and is connected to the front and back support members, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, respectively. Preferably, the axle <b>68</b> runs through lower regions of the front and back support members <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>. As can be seen, the front support member <b>54</b> depends farther down from the carrying tray <b>40</b> than the back support member <b>56</b>. While the lower support structure <b>58</b> is stationarily fixed to the trailer frame <b>22</b>, the axle <b>68</b> allows the upper support structure <b>52</b> to pivot along the pivot axis <b>62</b> of the pivot structure <b>60</b>.</p>
    <p>In an alternate embodiment of the tiltable support apparatus (not shown), the upper support structure <b>52</b> could also comprise, like the lower support structure <b>58</b>, a generally planar member that lies in the vertical plane parallel to the conveyor line of travel <b>64</b>. In this case, the angled pivot structure <b>60</b> could take on the form of a hinge structure joining together the two generally planar support structures <b>52</b>, <b>58</b>.</p>
    <p>The pivot axis <b>62</b> lies in a vertical plane parallel to the conveyor line of travel, which is shown in the drawings as horizontal line <b>64</b>. However, unlike conventional sorter conveyor tilting carts, the pivot axis <b>62</b> of the conveyor cart <b>20</b> of the invention is disposed at an angle θ to the conveyor line of travel <b>64</b> so as to impart two axial components to the tilting of the carrying tray <b>40</b>. Preferably, the pivot axis <b>62</b> is angled downwardly at an angle of approximately 20 to 45 degrees below horizontal in a forward direction. In the embodiment disclosed, the pivot axis <b>62</b> is angled downwardly 30 degrees. As can be seen in FIG. 5, the pivot axis <b>62</b> preferably intersects a plane occupied by the carrying tray <b>40</b> rearward of the center of the tray <b>40</b>.</p>
    <p>By disposing the pivot axis <b>62</b> at a downwardly directed angle θ instead of parallel to the conveyor line of travel <b>64</b>, two axial components are imparted to the tilting motion of the carrying tray <b>40</b>. The first axial component of the tray's tilting motion is lateral tipping on a horizontal axis parallel to the conveyor line of travel <b>64</b>. The second axial component of the tray's tilting motion is rotating around a vertical axis <b>66</b> perpendicular to the conveyor line of travel. Thus, while the tray only tilts along a single, angled pivot axis <b>62</b>, the overall motion of the tray <b>40</b> as it tilts includes two axial components.</p>
    <p>The tilting motion of the tray may also be described using three-dimensional X, Y, and Z-axis spatial coordinates, as shown in FIG. 5A, wherein the Y-axis is parallel to the conveyor line of travel <b>64</b>, the X-axis extends horizontally perpendicular to the line of travel <b>64</b>, and the Z-axis extends vertically perpendicular to the line of travel <b>64</b>. In the present invention, tilting of the tray <b>40</b> includes a Y-axis and a Z-axis component, for as shown in FIG. 5A the pivot axis <b>62</b> intersects the Y and Z axes. Specifically and for illustrative purposes only, using the preferred 37.5 degree downward angle θ of the pivot axis <b>62</b>, it can be appreciated that the ratio of Y-axis motion to Z-axis motion is 60:30. In other words, with a 30 degree angle θ, the tray <b>40</b> laterally tips somewhat farther than it rotates. If the angle θ of the pivot axis <b>62</b> is increased to 45 degrees below horizontal, then the tray will tilt and rotate equally.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIGS. 6 and 6A, one effect of this two-axis tilting of the carrying tray <b>40</b> is that a side <b>44</b> <i>b </i>of the tray that is tilted downwardly also rotates rearwardly relative to the cart <b>20</b>, as shown in FIG. 6A by line <b>46</b> <i>a. </i>Side <b>44</b> <i>d </i>of the tray, which is tilted upwardly, rotates forwardly relative to the cart <b>20</b>, as shown in FIG. 6A by line <b>46</b> <i>b. </i>In the preferred embodiment, in which the pivot axis <b>62</b> intersects the plane occupied by the tray <b>40</b> rear-of-center, the front side <b>44</b> <i>a </i>of the tray <b>40</b> rotates a greater distance around the vertical axis <b>66</b> than the back side <b>44</b> <i>c </i>of the tray <b>40</b>, upon tilting of the tray <b>40</b>. As shown in FIG. 6A, the bisecting center line of the tray <b>40</b> rotates farther at its forward end from the horizontal line of travel <b>64</b> than at its rearward end. Thus, front side rotation line <b>48</b> <i>a </i>follows a longer arc than back side rotation line <b>48</b> <i>b. </i>By rearwardly rotating whichever side of the tray <b>40</b> is being tilted downwardly, some rearward velocity is imparted to packages <b>11</b> as they are being discharged from the cart <b>20</b> of the invention into an unloading station <b>18</b>. Thus, packages are discharged at a lower velocity relative to the unloading station than the velocity of the train of conveyor carts as a whole. This enables the packages to be discharged into a narrower chute than could be accomplished using a conventional conveyor cart. Additionally, because the packages are slowed down somewhat as they are discharged, there is less potential for damage to occur.</p>
    <p>As can be seen in the drawings, the tray <b>40</b> may also include upwardly angled lateral wings <b>42</b> to help prevent packages <b>11</b> from accidentally falling off the tray <b>40</b>. These wings <b>42</b> also decrease the angle of the slope created when the tray <b>40</b> is tilted, which helps with gentle handling of the packages <b>11</b> as they are discharged from the cart <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p>When a carrying tray <b>40</b> reaches a particular destination unloading station <b>18</b>, the tilting mechanism <b>80</b> tilts the carrying tray <b>40</b> to cause a package <b>11</b> carried thereon to be discharged into the unloading station <b>18</b>. The tilting mechanism <b>80</b> generally includes components mounted on each conveyor cart <b>20</b> and components associated with each unloading station <b>18</b>. First is a pair of actuating arms <b>82</b> attached beneath each cart's carrying tray <b>40</b> on opposite lateral sides thereof, one actuating arm <b>82</b> on each side of the cart's tiltable support apparatus <b>50</b>. Second is a pull-down mechanism <b>90</b> immediately upstream from each unloading station <b>18</b>. The pull-down mechanism <b>90</b>, when activated, selectively pulls down one of the actuating arms <b>82</b> and thereby pulls the respective side of the tray <b>40</b> downwardly and rearwardly into the biaxially tilted position described above. Third is a push-up mechanism <b>110</b> downstream of the unloading station <b>18</b>, which pushes up the actuating arm <b>82</b> pulled down by the pull-down mechanism <b>90</b> and thereby reorients the tray <b>40</b> into its normal, upright position. Fourth is a locking structure <b>120</b>, which locks the carrying tray <b>40</b> in the tilted position upon pulling down of one of the actuating arms <b>82</b>, and which also locks the carrying tray <b>40</b> in its normal, upright position upon pushing up of that actuating arm <b>82</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIGS. 7 and 7A, each actuating arm <b>82</b> is pivotally attached to the underside of one side of the carrying tray and is preferably connected to the front and back support members, <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> respectively, of the upper support structure <b>52</b>. In the embodiment shown, the actuating arm <b>82</b> is attached to the front and back support members by an angled pivot hinge axle <b>84</b> that runs through both support members <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> and through the upper end of the actuating arm <b>82</b>. The actuating arm <b>82</b> therefore pivots on a pivot axis <b>86</b> that is preferably parallel to the pivot axis <b>62</b> of the tiltable support apparatus <b>50</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>5</b>. As can be seen from an examination of the drawings, the actuating arms <b>82</b> and their respective pivot axes <b>86</b> remain substantially in a vertical plane parallel to the conveyor line of travel <b>64</b> when stationary and when being pulled down or pushed up.</p>
    <p>Each actuating arm <b>82</b> also includes a cam follower <b>88</b>, which engages the pull-down and push-up mechanisms <b>90</b>, <b>110</b>, as will be described below. The cam follower <b>88</b> is preferably mounted on the lower end of the actuating arm <b>82</b> on an outer surface <b>82</b> a thereof. It is conceivable, however, that the cam follower <b>88</b> could be replaced with a friction reducing slide block or other protrusion for engagement by the pull-down and push-up mechanisms <b>90</b>, <b>110</b>.</p>
    <p>Seen in detail in FIGS. 8, <b>8</b>A, <b>9</b>, and <b>9</b>A, a pull-down mechanism <b>90</b> is associated with each unloading station <b>18</b> and is located beneath the rail <b>14</b> running closest to the unloading station <b>18</b> on the upstream side thereof, as indicated in FIG. <b>6</b>A. The pull-down mechanism <b>90</b> includes a descending ramp <b>92</b> and a laterally pivoting switch <b>94</b> that, when actuated, pivots open and directs the cam follower <b>88</b> of a passing actuating arm <b>82</b> into the descending ramp <b>92</b>. As can be seen in the drawings, when the switch <b>94</b> is not actuated, the switch is in a closed position parallel to the ramp <b>92</b>, and the cam follower <b>88</b> is free to bypass the switch and the descending ramp <b>92</b>. However, when a particular package <b>11</b> arrives at its destination unloading station <b>18</b>, the switch <b>94</b> is automatically actuated so that it pivots open into the path of the passing cam follower <b>88</b>, capturing the cam follower <b>88</b>. The cam follower <b>88</b> then rolls through the switch <b>94</b>, causing the actuating arm <b>82</b> to pivot outwardly somewhat, and into the descending ramp <b>92</b>. As the cam follower <b>88</b> rolls through the switch <b>94</b>, the cam follower <b>88</b> engages a closure flange <b>104</b> and enters the descending ramp <b>92</b>. Next, the descending ramp <b>92</b> forces the cam follower <b>88</b> and the associated actuating arm <b>82</b> downwardly so as to pull down one side of the tray <b>40</b>, thereby discharging the package from the tray <b>40</b> into the unloading station <b>18</b> adjacent the pull-down mechanism <b>90</b>.</p>
    <p>A computer controller (not shown) is used to track all packages <b>11</b> moving on the conveyor <b>10</b> and to automatically actuate a switch <b>94</b> at the appropriate time when a particular package <b>11</b> reaches its destination unloading station or outfeed chute <b>18</b>. The computer is also connected to the opposed roller motor assembly <b>210</b> to control the movement of the conveyor train and maintain a desirable rate of speed.</p>
    <p>The pivot switch <b>94</b> is attached to a bi-directional actuator <b>150</b> as shown in FIGS. 8 and 8A. The bi-directional actuator is mounted below the pivot switch <b>94</b> away from the moving cam followers. As shown in FIG. 11, the bi-directional actuator <b>150</b> includes a coaxial arm <b>152</b> extending from an actuator motor <b>154</b> and connected to the interior of the pivot switch <b>94</b>.</p>
    <p>The actuator motor <b>154</b> rotates the coaxial arm <b>152</b> and the attached pivot switch <b>94</b> between the open position to capture the cam follower <b>88</b> and the closed position to allow the cam follower to bypass the unloading station. Power and communication means with the conveyor system is supplied to the actuator motor <b>154</b> via a cord <b>160</b>. To rotate the coaxial arm to an open position, power is continuously applied to the motor to maintain the pivot switch in the open position. When power is turned off, a coil spring positioned inside the actuator motor <b>154</b> biases the arm causing the pivot switch to rotate to the closed position. This combination of powered on and powered off enables the pivot switch to be controlled independently of the movement of the cam followers. In one embodiment, the actuator motor is a 500 Model 40R10102-10-11 rotary solenoid actuators (“the model 40R actuators”) from Ram Manufacturing Company, Inc. The actuator motor <b>154</b> is mounted within a heat sink <b>172</b>.</p>
    <p>As best seen in FIG. 11, an outer clevis <b>162</b> surrounds the actuator arm <b>152</b> and is mounted between an upper bracket <b>164</b> and a lower bracket <b>166</b>. The outer clevis <b>162</b> is mounted to a lower body <b>174</b> that is aligned substantially perpendicular to align with the lower bracket <b>166</b>. Connector means such as screw or bolts mount extend through the lower bracket <b>166</b> and lower body <b>174</b> to secure the bi-directional actuator to the tipping mechanism. The outer clevis <b>162</b> is sized larger than the actuator arm <b>152</b> such that as the arm rotates, the clevis maintains a fixed position. A roll pin <b>170</b> extends through the actuator arm <b>152</b> and outer clevis <b>162</b> and into the interior of the pivot switch <b>94</b>. The roll pin <b>170</b> is fixedly attached to the actuator arm <b>152</b> such that the rotation of the actuator arm moves the pin which thereby moves the pivot switch through the open and closed positions. The roll pin extends through apertures within the outer clevis such that the pin has a free range of movement.</p>
    <p>The outer clevis <b>162</b> and upper bracket <b>164</b> and lower bracket <b>166</b> protect the actuator arm <b>152</b> from stresses applied to the pivot switch <b>94</b>. The outer clevis <b>162</b> allows for the pivot switch to pivot about the clevis, but prevents the pivot switch from moving in a linear direction which could damage the actuator arm.</p>
    <p>In use, the actuator motor <b>154</b> is energized thereby rotating the actuator arm <b>152</b> causing the pivot switch to rotate to the open position. The next passing cam follower will be captured by the pivot switch and diverted into the unloading station path. After the cam follower has been captured, power to the actuator motor <b>152</b> will be stopped causing the inner coil spring to bias the pivot switch in the closed position. However, while the cam follower is running along the length of the pivot switch, the force of the wheel will maintain the switch in the open position. Once the cam follower has passed downstream of the pivot point, the pivot switch will rotate to a closed position by the biasing of the internal coil spring.</p>
    <p>This arrangement provides for the pivot switch to be maintained in an open position for the shortest duration thereby allowing the speed of the sorter conveyor to be increased over previous designs without the problem of the switch inadvertently remaining open and catching the next passing cam follower thereby starting the cascade effect. Powering down the pivot switch to the closed position will also remove inadvertent captures such as when a cam follower is missing from the actuating arm or if the cam follower were to jump the pivot switch without entering the unloading station. Previously available designs depended upon the cam followers passing along the pivot switch to rotate the pivot switch to the closed position.</p>
    <p>After the carrying tray <b>40</b> has been tilted and a package carried thereon has been discharged into an unloading station <b>18</b>, the carrying tray is reoriented into its normal upright position by the push-up mechanism <b>110</b>. Seen best in FIGS. 10 and 10A, a push-up mechanism <b>110</b> is associated with each unloading station <b>18</b> and is located beneath the track <b>12</b> adjacent the unloading station <b>18</b> on the downstream side thereof, as indicated in FIG. <b>6</b>A. Each push-up mechanism <b>110</b> includes an ascending ramp <b>112</b> below the rail <b>14</b> adjacent the unloading station <b>18</b>. The push-up mechanism <b>110</b> also includes a wedge-shaped frog <b>114</b> that engages the cam follower <b>88</b> on a pulled-down actuating arm <b>82</b> and directs the cam follower <b>88</b> into the ascending ramp <b>112</b>. The frog <b>114</b> is positioned low enough below the track <b>12</b> so that cam followers <b>88</b> will be engaged and directed into the ascending ramp <b>112</b> only if they have already been pulled down by the pull-down mechanism <b>90</b>. As the cam follower <b>88</b> is directed into the ascending ramp <b>112</b>, the actuating arm <b>82</b> is pivoted outwardly somewhat so that the outside edge <b>123</b> of the locking flange <b>122</b> will disengage from the tilted position locking channel <b>127</b>. To help pull the actuating arm <b>82</b> back into substantially vertical alignment after the locking flange <b>122</b> has slid over the slide surface <b>130</b>, the top of the ascending ramp <b>112</b> includes an inwardly turned section <b>116</b>.</p>
    <p>Now turning to the locking structure <b>120</b> of the tilting mechanism <b>80</b>, it can be seen best in FIGS. 7 and 7A that the locking structure <b>120</b> includes a pair of locking flanges <b>122</b>, a pair of locking blocks <b>124</b> mounted one each to the actuating arms <b>82</b>, and a biasing member <b>134</b> for biasing the actuating arms <b>82</b> inwardly into a locked position. Preferably, the locking flanges <b>122</b> laterally extend from both sides of the lower support structure <b>58</b> of the tiltable support apparatus <b>50</b>, although they could also be mounted to the trailer frame structure <b>22</b>. In the embodiment disclosed, the locking flanges <b>122</b> comprise generally planar steel plates having rollers <b>123</b> mounted to their outer edges <b>123</b>. In an alternate embodiment, the rollers <b>123</b> could be eliminated and the locking blocks <b>124</b> made of a low-friction material on which the roller-less outer edges of the locking flanges <b>122</b> could easily slide.</p>
    <p>Each locking block <b>124</b> is mounted to an inner surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>of the actuating arm <b>82</b> and includes two locking channels <b>126</b> and <b>134</b> separated by a cammed section <b>130</b> having a generally convex outer surface. The lower <b>126</b> of the two locking channels receives the roller <b>123</b> at the outer edge of the lateral locking flange <b>122</b> when the carrying tray <b>40</b> is in its upright position. The upper <b>134</b> of the two locking channels receives the roller <b>123</b> when the carrying tray <b>40</b> is in its tilted position. As the tray <b>40</b> is tilted from one position to the other, the roller <b>123</b> rolls over the cammed section <b>130</b> interposed between the two locking channels <b>126</b>, <b>134</b>. Preferably, the locking blocks <b>124</b> are made of a wear-resistant material such as plastic, although other materials could be used. The biasing member, which may be a spring <b>134</b>, pulls the actuating arms <b>82</b> inwardly so as to engage the locking structure <b>120</b> by seating the locking flanges <b>122</b> in one of the locking channels <b>126</b>, <b>134</b>.</p>
    <p>During tilting of the tray <b>40</b> by the pull-down mechanism <b>90</b>, the actuating arm <b>82</b> being pulled down is pivoted outward slightly on the pivot axis <b>86</b> as the cam follower <b>88</b> is captured by the switch <b>94</b> and directed into the descending ramp <b>92</b>. This outward pivoting of the actuating arm <b>82</b> causes the upright position locking channel <b>126</b> to disengage from the locking flange <b>122</b>. Then, as the cam follower <b>88</b> is pulled down by the descending ramp <b>92</b>, the locking flange <b>122</b> rolls upwardly over the cammed section <b>130</b>. Because of the curved, convex shape of the cammed section <b>130</b> of the locking block <b>124</b>, the actuating arm <b>82</b> remains substantially vertical as it is pulled down. This helps prevent the cam follower <b>88</b> from slipping out of the descending ramp <b>92</b> of the pull-down mechanism <b>90</b>. Eventually, the locking flange <b>122</b> is seated in the tilted position locking channel <b>134</b> as the wheel exits the descending ramp <b>92</b> and the tray <b>40</b> reaches its fully tilted position. The degree to which the tray <b>40</b> is tilted in the fully tilted position can vary depending on the configuration of the locking blocks <b>124</b> and the pull-down mechanism <b>90</b>. However, in the embodiment disclosed, the tray <b>40</b> is tilted approximately 37.5 degrees from horizontal in the fully tilted position.</p>
    <p>The biasing member <b>134</b> holds the tilted position locking channel <b>134</b> and the locking flange <b>122</b> together while the cart <b>20</b> is moving past the unloading station <b>18</b>, stabilizing the tray <b>40</b> in the tilted position. Then, when the downwardly pulled actuating arm <b>82</b> reaches the push-up mechanism, the arm <b>82</b> is pivoted outwardly by the wedge-shaped frog <b>114</b> engaging the cam follower <b>88</b>. This outward pivoting causes the locking flange <b>122</b> to disengage from the tilted position locking channel <b>134</b>. As the cam follower <b>88</b> moves up the ascending ramp <b>112</b>, the locking flange rolls downwardly over the cammed section <b>130</b>. As the inwardly turned top end <b>116</b> of the ascending ramp <b>112</b> pivots the actuating arm <b>82</b> back to its vertical orientation, the locking flange <b>122</b> seats in the upright position locking channel <b>126</b>, where it is held in place through the action of the biasing member <b>134</b>.</p>
    <p>The actuating arm <b>82</b> on the opposite side of the conveyor cart <b>20</b>, which is not being pulled down or pushed up at a particular unloading station <b>18</b>, simply rises and falls with the side of the tray <b>40</b> to which it is attached. The locking flange <b>122</b> on this side of the cart <b>20</b> simply rolls over a flat section <b>132</b> of the locking block <b>124</b> below the upright position locking channel <b>126</b>.</p>
    <p>In an alternate embodiment (not shown) of the package sorting conveyor <b>10</b> of the invention, the conveyor cart <b>20</b> could include a tiltable support apparatus having a pivot axis that is not angled downwardly but that is generally parallel to the conveyor line of travel <b>64</b>. In this case, the tilting motion of the carrying tray <b>40</b> would only have a single axial component—lateral tipping on a horizontal axis parallel to the conveyor line of travel <b>64</b>. While package sorting conveyors having a single-axis lateral tipping motion have been designed in the past, they do not include the other inventive features of the present sorting conveyor <b>10</b> such as the vertically oriented opposed roller motor assembly <b>210</b>, the hitch mechanism <b>32</b> and auxiliary cart connector <b>34</b>, and the tilting mechanism <b>80</b> with its associated components. However, for many applications, a single axis tiltable cart will be sufficient.</p>
    <p>Such single-axis conveyor carts would primarily be incorporated into the package sorting conveyor <b>10</b> of the present invention for use in sorting particularly large packages that must be carried by two or more adjacent carrying carts <b>20</b>. In this case, the trays of the adjacent carts could be simultaneously tilted as the carts reached an unloading station to discharge the package. This would also of course require an especially wide outfeed chute as well as a pull-down mechanism adjacent the unloading station for each cart to be simultaneously tilted.</p>
    <p>The reason that single-axis conveyor carts are especially useful for sorting large packages is that it has been found that this double (or triple, etc.) unloading of particularly large packages using the two-axis carrying carts <b>20</b> of the present invention occasionally presents difficulties due to the carrying trays <b>40</b> not being in the same spatial plane when they are both in their fully tilted positions. Therefore, for double unloading, it is preferable to use the alternate, single-axis embodiment of the conveyor cart.</p>
    <p>Several configurations of the package sorting conveyor <b>10</b> may be employed that utilize the alternate, single-axis conveyor carts for double unloading situations. A preferable configuration would comprise two adjacent single-axis carts for carrying a single large package. A second configuration would comprise a leading two-axis conveyor cart <b>20</b> and a trailing single-axis cart. A third configuration would comprise a leading single-axis conveyor cart and a trailing two-axis conveyor cart <b>20</b>. As a whole, the package sorting conveyor <b>10</b> of the invention may include both two-axis conveyor carts <b>20</b> as well as single-axis conveyor carts interspersed among each other depending on a particular facility's conveying and sorting requirements.</p>
    <p>As best shown in FIGS. 12 and 13, the preferred embodiment of the opposed motor roller assembly <b>210</b> of the present invention is comprised of a pair of support frames <b>212</b>, <b>212</b>′, a pair of opposed drive roller assemblies <b>214</b>, <b>214</b>′, and a pair of motor assemblies <b>216</b>, <b>216</b>′. The second drive roller assembly <b>214</b>′ provides the opposing surface <b>220</b> that exerts pressure in conjunction with the first drive roller <b>214</b> on the driven fin <b>36</b> of the cart <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 12 shows a top view of the opposed motor roller assembly <b>210</b>. The drive roller assemblies <b>214</b>, <b>214</b>′ are mounted on respective pivot block assemblies <b>236</b>, <b>236</b>′ and are connected to the shafts of motor assemblies <b>216</b>, <b>216</b>′ with drive belts <b>262</b>, <b>262</b>′. Motor assemblies <b>216</b>, <b>216</b>′ are attached with bolts passing through slotted holes <b>218</b> in pivot block assemblies <b>236</b>, <b>236</b>′ of adjustable sub-frame assemblies <b>224</b>, <b>224</b>′.</p>
    <p>Pivot block assemblies <b>236</b>, <b>236</b>′ are connected forward of the first shafts <b>226</b>, <b>226</b>′ with a compression linkage <b>242</b>. The first end <b>244</b> of compression linkage <b>242</b> is attached to pivot block assembly <b>236</b> and the second end <b>244</b>′ of compression linkage <b>242</b> is attached to pivot block assembly <b>236</b>′.</p>
    <p>Caster linkage <b>246</b> is an adjustable connector having two ends <b>250</b> and <b>252</b>. First end <b>250</b> attaches to pivot block <b>236</b> and second end <b>252</b> attaches to base <b>222</b>. Caster linkage <b>246</b> may alternatively be connected between pivot block <b>236</b> and base <b>222</b>. The caster linkage <b>246</b> helps to ensure that the opposed motor roller assembly <b>210</b> remains fixed relative to the track structure.</p>
    <p>FIG. 13 shows that the pair of support frames <b>212</b> and base <b>222</b> are attached to the conveyor track <b>12</b> (see FIG. 14 for track <b>12</b>) and adjustable sub-frame assemblies <b>224</b>, <b>224</b>′. Adjustable sub-frame assemblies <b>224</b>, <b>224</b>′ include pivot block assemblies <b>236</b>, <b>236</b>′, first shafts <b>226</b>, <b>226</b>′ that pass through pivot block assemblies <b>236</b>, <b>236</b>′, and camber linkage <b>232</b>, which is attached to the lower ends <b>234</b>, <b>234</b>′ of first shafts <b>226</b>, <b>226</b>′, as also best seen in FIG. <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p>The first shafts <b>226</b>, <b>226</b>′ are connected to base <b>222</b> with dowel pins <b>230</b>, <b>230</b>′. By adjusting the length of camber linkage <b>232</b>, the vertical alignment of the adjustable sub-frame assemblies <b>224</b>, <b>224</b>′ may be adjusted. Adjustable sub-frame assemblies <b>224</b>, <b>224</b>′ also include second shafts <b>238</b>, <b>238</b>′ which pass through the pivot block assemblies <b>236</b>, <b>236</b>′ and roller assemblies <b>214</b>, <b>214</b>′.</p>
    <p>The first shafts <b>226</b>, <b>226</b>′ and second shafts <b>238</b>, <b>238</b>′ have a plurality of Ringfedders™ locking rings <b>254</b>, <b>254</b>′ on the ends nearest the pivot block assemblies <b>236</b>, <b>236</b>′. A sufficient number of Ringfedders™ locking rings <b>254</b>, <b>254</b>′ are placed on each shaft prior to inserting it into the pivot block assembly to insure that, when compressed, the shaft is centered and secured.</p>
    <p>The drive roller assemblies <b>214</b>, <b>214</b>′ are generally cylindrical and are made of aluminum or other light-weight alloy. They each have frictional surfaces <b>258</b>, <b>258</b>′ at the end nearest the pivot block assemblies <b>236</b>, <b>236</b>′ for engaging drive belts <b>262</b>, <b>262</b>′ and outer elastomeric surfaces <b>256</b>, <b>256</b>′ of about ¼″ thickness on most of the remainder of the surface. The frictional surface <b>258</b> is preferably a series of circumferential grooves that mate with the drive belt <b>262</b>. The drive belt may be a poly v-belt, which is available from Browning Company in Florence, Kentucky. The outer elastomeric surface is preferably polyurethane with a durometer value (Shore Type A) between 60 and 90. A suitable roller is an opposed drive roller is made of a polyurethane and is available from Urethane Innovators of New Bern, N. C. This selection of material was made in order to balance durability and performance (i.e., resistance to slippage) of the rollers in this application.</p>
    <p>Table 1, below shows the relative wear on a 1-5 scale of polyurethane compounds having different durometer (Shore Type A) values compared with relative slippage. The range of 60 to 90 was chosen because of the location of the crossover in slippage and wear properties.</p>

    <p>In addition, as discussed above, pairs of LIMs, spaced at 80 feet intervals and operated at 480 volts, draws about 15 amps. This is about 90 watts per foot of sorter for about 70 pounds of thrust. Also, a prior art chain drive would draw about 15 watts per foot of sorter for about 1500 pounds of thrust. To the contrary, the present invention drive rollers spaced at 160 feet intervals and operated at 480 volts, draws about 4 amps. This is only about 12 watts per foot of sorter for about 100 pounds of thrust!</p>
    <p>Certain modifications and improvements will occur to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the foregoing description. For example, while the preferred embodiment described is for a two-axis tiltable cart, many applications could be performed satisfactory using a single axis tiltable cart, as described in the claims. In addition, while a pair of drive motors is preferred, a single motor driving only one of the rollers or a single motor using, for example, a second drive belt to drive the second roller may be satisfactory for some applications. It should be understood that all such modifications and improvements have been deleted herein for the sake of conciseness and readability but are properly within the scope of the following claims.</p>
