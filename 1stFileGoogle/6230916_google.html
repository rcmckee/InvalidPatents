An integrated dunnage structure is coupled to the body and is operable for moving into an engagement position when the container body is erected to thereby engage a product placed in the container for shipment. The dunnage structure is further operable for moving into a relaxed position when the container body is collapsed so that the container and dunnage structure may be returned together for reuse. The container provides reusable dunnage which is usable with the container when it is shipped and subsequently remains with the container when it is returned for being reused when the container is again shipped.

No. 5,725,119, entitled “Collapsible Container with Integrally Supported Dunnage,” which issued Mar. 10, 1998. Both the application and patent are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention relates generally to shipping containers used to ship products, and more specifically to collapsible containers which are returnable in an empty state for reuse.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Returnable and reusable containers are utilized by manufacturers to ship a variety of different products to end users which are usually assembly plants. For example, in the automobile industry, an assembly plant assembling a particular automobile might utilize a number of different parts manufacturers. These manufacturers ship their respective parts to the assembly plant in reusable containers where the parts are then assembled together into a finished automobile. The reusable containers are then returned to the parts manufacturers for use in further shipments. The return and reuse of such containers results in a substantial savings in shipping and packaging costs for the manufacturer, as may be appreciated, because they reduce the number of new containers which must be purchased. Furthermore, the returned containers alleviate the assembly plant's task of having to store, destroy, or otherwise dispose of the containers, thus resulting in substantial cost savings to the plant.</p>
    <p>While such returnable and reusable containers reduce shipping costs by eliminating the need to constantly purchase new containers, it is still relatively costly to provide for their return shipment. This is particularly so since the charge rate for return shipment is based upon the volume of the container and upon the number of containers which might be situated in a return vehicle, such as a truck. With conventional containers used in the past, there has been a one-to-one (1:1) return-to-shipment ratio because an empty container occupies the same shipping space as a full container. Therefore, there is essentially not much of a shipping cost savings when returning an empty reusable container even though the empty container weighs less because it does not contain product.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the cost of storing conventional reusable containers reduces the economic benefits they offer because empty containers require the same warehouse or storage space as full containers. Container storage may be necessary for the plant before return shipment can be arranged. Similarly, the manufacturer will often store the containers on site to have them on hand and ready for shipment. Such storage space is often limited and it is usually desirable to utilize the space for something other than bulky, empty containers waiting to be shipped or returned. Therefore, the economic benefits of currently available reusable containers is further reduced by the cost both to the end user assembly plant and manufacturer in storage space requirements.</p>
    <p>Some currently available reusable containers have addressed such problems by being collapsible into a smaller size or volume to thereby require less space when returned or stored. For example, some available reusable containers are collapsible into a volume essentially one-third (⅓) or one-fourth (¼) of their volume when shipped full of product. This provides a three-to-one (3:1) or four-to-one (4:1) return-to-shipment ratio, and thus, provides a substantial savings in return shipment costs. That is, a truck returning the containers to the originating site can carry three or four times the number of empty, collapsed containers as full containers. Additionally, collapsed, stored containers require substantially less storage space. One such currently available collapsible container is produced by the Ropak Corporation of Georgetown, Ky., and can be reduced or collapsed to a size which is one-third (⅓) the size of a full, erected container. Another collapsible and reusable container is available from MONOFLO International, Inc. of Winchester, Va. and reduces to one-fourth (¼) the size of the erected container.</p>
    <p>While such containers address the issue of return shipment and storage costs, they still have certain drawbacks. For example, it may be necessary to utilize dunnage elements, such as partitions or separating structures, in the container during shipment for separating and protecting the products shipped in the container. The separate dunnage elements must be handled accordingly apart from the container during shipment and return. That is, when the container has been assembled into an erected form for shipment and dunnage elements are to be utilized, the dunnage must be separately inserted and secured within the container. Subsequently, prior to return shipment, any dunnage elements utilized within the container must be detached and removed therefrom before the container can be collapsed into the smaller, returnable shape. As may be appreciated, the dunnage elements are then discarded or otherwise disposed of by the assembly plant adding to the plant's overall cost for the shipment. Furthermore, the manufacturer must construct or acquire new dunnage elements each time the returned container is reused for shipment and thus must incur the necessary costs associated therewith. Additionally, the manufacturing labor associated with constructing and installing dunnage elements in a container, and then the plant labor for collapsing, removing and disposing of the dunnage elements after shipment, further increases the cost of shipping product utilizing conventional containers. Therefore, even with collapsible containers, high shipping costs are incurred on both ends, i.e., by the manufacturer who constantly acquires new dunnage elements and by the assembly plant which constantly must dispose of the old dunnage elements or pay to have those dunnage elements returned with the container.</p>
    <p>The current prior art products have not recognized such a problem and certainly have not addressed the resulting high shipping costs. Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to reduce the overall shipping costs normally associated with shipping product. It is another objective to reduce such shipping costs associated with both original shipment and return shipment.</p>
    <p>It is further an objective of the present invention to reduce the manufacturer's time and labor costs associated with erecting a container and constructing and securing dunnage elements therein to protect the shipped product.</p>
    <p>It is still another objective to reduce the manufacturer's replacement costs of dunnage elements for returned, reusable containers.</p>
    <p>It is an additional objective to reduce storage space requirements associated with reusable containers and/or dunnage materials.</p>
    <p>It is still another objective of the present invention to reduce the time and labor costs to the assembly plant associated with removing, dismantling and discarding used dunnage elements prior to collapsing and returning empty containers.</p>
    <p>It is further an objective of the present invention to provide a returnable and reusable container which adequately contains and protects product shipped therein and will occupy less space during return shipment than during original shipment.</p>
    <p>These objectives and other objectives will become more readily apparent from the further description of the invention below.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention comprises a reusable and returnable container which has collapsible dunnage therein which is returnable and reusable along with the container. The body of the container is configured and operable for being manipulated into an erected position for containing product placed therein during shipment and for subsequently being manipulated, when empty of product, into a collapsed position for reducing the size of the container for return shipment. Dunnage structures are positioned generally inside the container body and are operably coupled to the body in accordance with the invention. The dunnage structures move into an engagement position when the container body is erected to thereby engage and protect product placed in the container for shipment. The dunnage structures also move into a relaxed position when the container body is emptied of product and is subsequently collapsed so that the container and integrated dunnage structures may be returned together for reuse. To reuse the dunnage structures, the container is simply erected for another shipment and the dunnage structures will again move into the engagement position. Therefore, the invention provides reusable dunnage to protect shipped product and the dunnage is returnable with the returned container and will always remain with the container. Therefore, the dunnage does not have to be separately assembled and placed in the container. Furthermore, the dunnage does not have to be removed from the empty container and discarded or otherwise handled. The invention further provides dunnage which is always ready for use and which does not affect the operation and collapsibility of the container. The dunnage is generally protected by the body of the container both during product shipment and during return shipment.</p>
    <p>Since, the dunnage structures of the invention are operable to return to an engagement position or support position when the container is erected for shipment, new dunnage does not have to be constantly purchased by the manufacturer for shipping product, thereby resulting in substantial cost savings to the manufacturer. Additionally, specialized labor is not required to construct and secure dunnage within the container, because the dunnage structures are already constructed and secured upon erecting the container, thus yielding additional cost savings for the manufacturer. At the plant, the dunnage does not have to be removed, disassembled and discarded, thereby yielding substantial savings in labor costs and disposal costs for the assembly plant. Both the manufacturer and plant also benefit from the reduced shipping and storage requirements of the collapsed container.</p>
    <p>One embodiment of the invention comprises a collapsible container having a body with a pallet base or bottom and four opposing, collapsible side wall structures or side walls which are hingedly coupled to the container bottom along bottom edges thereof. The side walls are movable between an erected position generally perpendicular to the bottom and a collapsed position whereby they are folded inwardly of the container to rest adjacent the bottom for reducing the volume of the empty container body prior to storage or return shipment. Pliable dunnage pouches are operably coupled to the side walls.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, rail elements extend along the upper edges of two opposing side walls, generally parallel to the side walls. When the side walls are erected, multiple flexible support structures, preferably flexible cables, extend between the opposing side walls with their ends secured to the rail elements to span across the container. The pliable dunnage pouches, made of a suitable cloth or plastic material, are secured to the support cables, such as by sewing or heat sealing, and are suspended therefrom so that the bottoms of the pouches are preferably held above or are attached to the container bottom of the erected container. Attachment may be used to keep the pouches in position. Products for shipment may then be inserted into the pouches and are held and protected therein during shipment. The pouches engage and contain the products and prevent drastic movement within the container and further separate the products to prevent abrasion or breakage during shipment.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, the pouches might be coupled at their ends directly to the side walls thereby eliminating the support cables. In such an embodiment, the side walls would suspend the pouches rather than the cables.</p>
    <p>To collapse the container, the opposing side walls are hinged down against the container bottom. When the side walls supporting the dunnage pouches are collapsed and are folded inwardly along their hinged bottom edges, the dunnage pouches are dropped into the bottom of the container body. The pouches drop with the flexing support cables which are relaxed or simply drop with the walls in the absence of cables. Preferably, the opposing side walls supporting the dunnage pouches are hinged downwardly first and are then overlapped by the other set of side walls to form the collapsed container. When the set of side walls supporting the dunnage pouches are collapsed first and then are covered or overlapped by the other set of opposing side walls, the dunnage is completely secured to and preferably contained within the collapsed container. The collapsed container, including dunnage, may then be shipped or stored as a unit and is ready for reuse in accordance with the principles of the invention. In a preferred embodiment, the vertical height of the collapsed containers is about one-third (⅓) the height of the erected container to provide a three-to-one (3:1) return-to-shipment ratio.</p>
    <p>In the embodiment of the invention using rail elements and cables, the cables are preferably slidably coupled to the rail elements for sliding the pouches as desired in the container. Preferably, tensioners are connected in-line with the cables to ensure proper tension on the cables for proper product support and protection by the dunnage pouches. Alternatively, the support cables might be rigidly attached and secured directly to the side walls without any rail elements.</p>
    <p>In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the container comprises a collapsible and carryable tote having a generally smaller size body than the pallet container previously described so that it may be handled manually. One embodiment of the tote container of the invention has a body which includes a bottom element, a top element and separate collapsible side walls extending therebetween. Another tote container embodiment has a unitary body which has integrally connected side walls. Dunnage, such as dunnage pouches, are coupled to the tote container body for being used during shipment and returned with the container as described.</p>
    <p>One version of the tote container embodiment includes support structures, such as flexible support cables, which are operable to suspend dunnage pouches in the tote container when the side walls are erected. Preferably, the cables are coupled to rail elements proximate the top of the container and are slidable thereon for moving the pouches laterally in the tote container. Alternatively, the cables might be fixed directly to the container at the top thereof rather than to a rail element. Preferably, tensioner elements in-line with the cables provide tension on the cables.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, the dunnage pouches are coupled at their ends to the side walls or to the top element and are supported without cables. The pouches are then raised and lowered when the side walls are erected or collapsed as described.</p>
    <p>The flexible support cables and dunnage pouches are lowered when the opposing side walls of the tote container are collapsed to thereby drop the dunnage pouches between the side walls and to the bottom of the tote container. Unlike the pallet container embodiment previously described, the cables and pouches are not completely relaxed or flexed when the body of the tote container is collapsed because the side walls are folded down at their middle rather than folded inwardly from the bottom. The top of the container generally maintains its rectangular shape but is simply lowered toward the bottom of the container to lower the pouches. Therefore, the cables or pouches are always stretched between the opposing sides of the tote container.</p>
    <p>More specifically, a first set of side walls hinge at a top edge thereof and are movable between a vertical position and a horizontal position proximate the top of the body. The other set of side walls folds inwardly of the container generally in the middle of the side wall to lower the top of the container against the bottom of the container to reduce the overall height of the container. More particularly, an upper edge of the side wall is hingedly coupled to the top of the body while a lower edge of the side wall is hingedly coupled to the bottom of the body. The side walls also hinge inwardly intermediately between the top and bottom of the body. By folding the side walls inwardly at their intermediate hinges, the side walls collapse and are folded generally in half to lower the top of the body toward the bottom of the body, and thus collapse the container and dunnage.</p>
    <p>To collapse the tote container, the respective side walls having the single hinged edge are moved upwardly toward the top of the container to lie in a generally horizontal plane. Next, the foldable side walls are hinged at their top and bottom edges and generally in the middle simultaneously to fold the side walls into the center of the container so that the top of the container is lowered to a position adjacent the bottom of the container. As may be appreciated, when the first side walls are hinged, the pliable pouches are pushed upwardly from below and collapse to rest on top of the side walls and generally adjacent to the top of the container. In that way, the collapsed dunnage pouches are lowered to the container bottom when the container body is collapsed and the vertical height of the container is reduced for return shipment.</p>
    <p>To reuse the tote container and dunnage pouches, the top of the container is lifted above the bottom of the container, and the folded side walls are again erected outwardly from the center for suspending the dunnage pouches. Then, the other hinged side walls are swung downwardly to the vertical position to complete the erected container and to drop the dunnage pouches so that they are again suspended from the top of the container. The non-folding walls maintain the container in the erect shape. In a preferred embodiment, the tote container collapses to a vertical height approximately one-fourth (¼) the height of the erected tote container, thereby yielding approximately a four-to-one (4:1) return-to-shipment ratio.</p>
    <p>Another alternative embodiment of the invention comprises a reusable and returnable rack container which has a collapsible frame. The frame has a bottom or base element and a top element situated vertically above the bottom element. A plurality of vertical legs are positioned between the bottom and top elements. The legs are operable for raising and lowering the top of the frame to erect and collapse the rack. Dunnage, and preferably dunnage pouches are supported on the rack in accordance with the principles of the invention.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, each leg is hingedly coupled to the top frame element at an upper end and to the bottom frame element at a lower end. The legs hinge along their length between the top and bottom ends thereof and preferably have a hinge structure situated proximate the middle of the leg. To collapse the rack, the respective hinged legs are folded in half and inwardly to lower the top element or top of the frame toward a position adjacent the bottom or bottom element of the frame. In that way, the dunnage pouches are lowered and collapse to lie nested with the top and bottom elements of the frame. The vertical height of the rack is reduced and the rack is ready for return shipment.</p>
    <p>In an alternative embodiment, the rack legs are of a telescoping construction and will telescope in length to erect and collapse the rack container. To reuse the rack container, the top of the frame is lifted above the bottom of the frame, and the legs are again erected to suspend the dunnage pouches. The hinged legs and telescoping legs are operable to lock in an erected position to keep the frame erect when so desired.</p>
    <p>The rack container embodiment utilizes a collapsible dunnage structure as previously described. For example, dunnage pouches may be suspended from flexible cables or may be fixed at their ends directly to the rack container frame. When the rack container is collapsed, the dunnage is dropped to the bottom of the frame.</p>
    <p>In still a further alternative embodiment of the invention, a container comprises a base, a top, and a collapsible sleeve pack therebetween for containing the product and supporting the dunnage. More specifically, the sleeve pack includes two opposing, non-foldable side walls and two opposing foldable side walls, which are hingedly coupled, along vertical edges thereof, to the non-foldable side walls. The dunnage of the invention is coupled to either the foldable or non-foldable side walls.</p>
    <p>When the container is erected, the dunnage pouches are held in an engagement position to engage, contain and protect product placed therein. The dunnage pouches are held in the engagement position by flexible cables extending between two opposing side walls which are fixed to the side walls as described above. Alternatively, the ends of the pouches may be fixed to the side walls without cables.</p>
    <p>To erect the container, the foldable side walls are situated to extend generally perpendicular to the non-foldable side walls to form a sleeve pack which is fitted into a base and covered by a top. When the container is erected, the dunnage pouches move from a relaxed or collapsed position to an engagement position. A reinforcement bar may be used proximate one or both of the foldable side walls to maintain the container in an erected position.</p>
    <p>To return the container, the sleeve pack is removed from the bottom and is collapsed by folding the foldable side walls inwardly to be positioned between the non-foldable side walls. The sleeve pack is thus flattened. In doing so, the dunnage pouches are moved to the collapsed position between the walls of the sleeve pack. The flattened sleeve packs are then stacked and returned, occupying considerably less space than an erected sleeve pack container, and the dunnage remains with the sleeve pack to be re-used when the sleeve pack is again erected for a container.</p>
    <p>Therefore, the collapsible container of the invention may be collapsed into a form having a lower height and a smaller volume which is preferably only about one-third (⅓) or one-fourth (¼) of the volume of the erected container. The usable and reusable dunnage therein remains with the container and is stored in the container in the collapsed state and automatically transforms into usable dunnage when the container is in the erected state. Accordingly, no dunnage removal and disposal costs are associated with collapsing the container for storage and return and no dunnage manufacturing and assembly costs are associated with erecting and shipping the container full of product because the dunnage is reusable with the container. The present invention thereby represents a substantial cost savings both in material costs and labor costs normally associated with handling dunnage when containers are shipped or returned. Furthermore, the erected container of the invention maintains usable integral dunnage while still being collapsible to a smaller volume for reducing storage and return shipment costs.</p>

    <p>The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention and, together with a general description of the invention given above, and the detailed description of the embodiments given below, serve to explain the principles of the invention.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p>FIG. 1 shows a container constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention, and particularly illustrates a container <b>10</b> having a pallet base <b>12</b> and often referred to as a pallet container. Container <b>10</b> is configured for being stacked and lifted from below by a device such as a forklift. Container <b>10</b> comprises a pallet bottom or base <b>12</b> having four side wall structures or side walls <b>14</b> <i>a, </i> <b>14</b> <i>b, </i> <b>14</b> <i>c </i>and <b>14</b> <i>d </i>(<b>14</b> <i>a</i>-<b>14</b> <i>d</i>). The base <b>12</b> may have bottom channels <b>13</b> for receiving the forks of a forklift truck. The side walls are arranged to oppose each other such that side wall <b>14</b> <i>a </i>is opposed by side wall <b>14</b> <i>c </i>and side wall <b>14</b> <i>b </i>is opposed by side wall <b>14</b> <i>d </i>to form a generally rectangular boxed-shaped container. The opposing side walls <b>14</b> <i>a</i>-<b>14</b> <i>d </i>are hinged on a bottom edge <b>16</b> thereof for folding downwardly onto the pallet base or bottom <b>12</b> (see FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>). In that way, the container <b>10</b> may be collapsed into a container of reduced size for return shipment at a reduced cost as is discussed further hereinbelow (see FIG. <b>3</b>).</p>
    <p>In a preferred embodiment of the invention as is illustrated in FIG. 1, the side walls are hingedly attached to base <b>12</b>. For example, side wall <b>14</b> <i>a </i>includes a plurality of regularly spaced hinge structures <b>17</b> which include indentations <b>18</b> configured to receive upwardly extending projections or tabs <b>20</b> on the base <b>12</b>. An elongated hinge pin <b>22</b> extends through appropriate openings (not shown) in the side wall indentations <b>18</b> and projections <b>20</b>. The hinge structures allow the side walls <b>14</b> <i>a</i>-<b>14</b> <i>d </i>to hinge inwardly of the container <b>10</b> and toward base <b>12</b> on the hinge axis <b>23</b>.</p>
    <p>As illustrated in FIG. 2, the hinge structures <b>17</b> created by the cooperating projections <b>20</b> and indentations <b>18</b> and hinge pins <b>22</b> allow the side wall <b>14</b> <i>a </i>to be moved from an erected position (FIG. 1) to a collapsed position (FIG. <b>2</b>). The remaining side walls <b>14</b> <i>b, </i> <b>14</b> <i>c </i>and <b>14</b> <i>d </i>are also hingedly attached to base <b>12</b> with hinge structures <b>17</b> and will similarly move between an erected position to erect the container and a collapsed position to collapse the container <b>10</b>. As will be appreciated by a person of ordinary skill in the art, other hinge structures than those shown might also be utilized.</p>
    <p>When the container is assembled for use and shipment of product, the side walls <b>14</b> <i>a</i>-<b>14</b> <i>d </i>are moved to an erected position as illustrated in FIG. <b>1</b>. Adjacent side walls, such as side wall <b>14</b> <i>a </i>and sidewall <b>14</b> <i>d, </i>include cooperating members of a latching structure <b>26</b> for holding the side walls in an erected position. For example, latching structure <b>26</b> might include a tab <b>28</b> extending from side wall <b>14</b> <i>d </i>which is received by an appropriately structured groove or indentation <b>30</b> on the adjacent side wall <b>14</b> <i>a. </i>The tab <b>28</b> and indentation <b>30</b> are appropriately configured to cooperate when the side walls are erected to latch the side walls in an erected position. They are subsequently releasable by pulling the tab <b>28</b> away from indentation <b>30</b>, for example, to collapse the side walls (see FIG. <b>2</b>).</p>
    <p>In accordance with the principles of the present invention, container <b>10</b> includes a dunnage structure which is coupled to the side walls and positioned generally inside the body of the container <b>10</b> formed by base <b>12</b> and the opposing side walls <b>14</b> <i>a</i>-<b>14</b> <i>d. </i>In one preferred embodiment, the dunnage structure includes a plurality of pliable pouches <b>40</b> which are supported by support structures, such as flexible cables <b>32</b>, which are coupled between support rails <b>34</b> between two opposing side walls, such as <b>14</b> <i>a </i>and <b>14</b> <i>c. </i>The pouches <b>40</b> may be made of, for example, a fabric or cloth material, such as heavy canvas, or plastic, such as a polyethylene or polyester. Referring to FIG. 1, the cables <b>32</b> span between the opposing side walls <b>14</b> <i>a, </i> <b>14</b> <i>c </i>when the side walls are in an erected position to form container <b>10</b>. Cables <b>32</b> are preferably coupled to the support rails <b>34</b> through a tensioning device, such as spring <b>36</b> as illustrated in FIG. <b>1</b>A. The spring is attached at one end to a slidable collar piece <b>38</b> which encircles rail <b>34</b> and slides thereon for adjustment of the spacing between adjacent cables <b>32</b> and pouches. The cable <b>32</b> is simply clamped, tied or otherwise fastened to the other end of spring <b>36</b>.</p>
    <p>The pliable dunnage pouches <b>40</b> are secured to the cables <b>32</b> and are suspended downwardly therefrom to hang inside of the container body <b>10</b>. Each pouch has opposing sides <b>41</b> <i>a, </i> <b>41</b> <i>b </i>to contain and protect product placed in the pouches <b>40</b>. An opening <b>42</b> to each dunnage pouch <b>40</b> is formed between adjacent support cables <b>32</b> so that a product, such as an automobile part, can be placed into the pouch for shipment. The dunnage pouches <b>40</b> engage the product and support the product in the container when the pouches are in their engagement position as illustrated in FIG. <b>1</b>. The adjacent parts in each of the dunnage pouches <b>40</b> are protected by the pouch sides <b>41</b> <i>a, </i> <b>41</b> <i>b </i>from abrasions or breakage and the pouch is suspended above the container base <b>12</b> during shipment. In one version, as illustrated in the Figures, a cable <b>32</b> supports a wall for two adjacent pouches. For example, cable <b>32</b> <i>a </i>supports pouch wall <b>41</b> <i>b </i>and also supports the pouch wall <b>41</b> <i>c </i>of an adjacent pouch. Alternatively, each pouch wall might require a cable. Preferably, the upper edges <b>43</b> of the pouches <b>40</b> are sewn around the cables <b>32</b> or are heat sealed around the cables for plastic pouch versions. Alternatively, some other fastening methods might be used to fix the pouches to the cables. The pouches may also be fixed directly to the walls as described below (FIG. <b>1</b>D).</p>
    <p>To ship product, the side walls <b>14</b> <i>a</i>-<b>14</b> <i>d </i>are hinged into an erected position and latched therein by latching structures <b>26</b>. Upon erecting containers <b>10</b>, the support cables <b>32</b> are stretched by the support rails <b>34</b> which are coupled to the opposing side walls <b>14</b> <i>a </i>and <b>14</b> <i>c </i>by suitable mounting structures <b>44</b>. When the cables <b>32</b> are stretched, the pouches <b>40</b> are suspended within container <b>10</b> and are ready to receive product for shipment. Once the product is placed in the pouches, the full container may then be shipped and the products will be protected both by the container side walls <b>14</b> <i>a</i>-<b>14</b> <i>d </i>and the integral suspended dunnage pouches <b>40</b>. The tension element or spring <b>36</b> insures that pouches <b>40</b> are sufficiently suspended and the spring preferably has an elasticity which is suitable for suspending a pouch full of the product to be shipped in the container <b>10</b>. Spacing between the various cables <b>32</b> and pouches <b>40</b> and the size of the openings <b>42</b> for the respective dunnage pouches <b>40</b> may be changed by sliding the collar pieces <b>38</b> on respective cables <b>32</b> along the support rails <b>34</b>.</p>
    <p>In accordance with the principles of the present invention, the dunnage structure of container <b>10</b>, such as the dunnage pouches <b>40</b>, are integrally operable with the container body <b>10</b> such that when the side walls <b>14</b> <i>a</i>-<b>14</b> <i>d </i>are erected to form the container body, the support rails <b>34</b> and cables <b>32</b> simultaneously erect the dunnage pouches into an operable or engagement position. After the product has been removed from the various dunnage pouches <b>40</b>, and the container <b>10</b> is ready to be returned to the manufacturer, the side walls <b>14</b> <i>a</i>-<b>14</b> <i>d </i>are moved to a collapsed position and the pouches to a relaxed position to reduce the size of the container for a more inexpensive return shipment.</p>
    <p>In an alternative embodiment of the invention as illustrated in FIG. 1B, the cables <b>32</b> might be fixed directly to side walls <b>14</b> <i>a, </i> <b>14</b> <i>c </i>through an opening <b>46</b> formed in the side wall such as side wall <b>14</b> <i>c. </i>The end of the cable is then secured to the side wall, such as with a cable clip <b>48</b> or other suitable fastening structure. The cable <b>32</b> illustrated in FIG. 1B would then not generally be adjustable along the side wall but would be fixed in its lateral position in the container <b>10</b>. Similar to the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the dunnage cables <b>32</b> directly fixed to the side walls <b>14</b> <i>a </i>and <b>14</b> <i>c </i>would be moved into a suspended position to span between the erected sidewalls <b>14</b> <i>a </i>and <b>14</b> <i>c </i>when the container is erected. Furthermore, the flexible cables will relax when the side walls are moved to a collapsed position.</p>
    <p>FIG. 1D illustrates another version of the container of the invention wherein the various support structures are eliminated. Therein, the dunnage structures, such as pouches <b>40</b>, are directly coupled to the side walls without cables <b>32</b>. For example, the pouches <b>40</b> have ends <b>45</b> which extend through openings <b>47</b> formed in the side walls. The pouch ends <b>45</b> are secured to the side walls <b>14</b> by mounting collars <b>51</b> or other appropriate devices. When the side walls collapse, the pouches move to a collapsed position in accordance with the principles of the present invention. In another version, the pouches <b>40</b> may be directly coupled to intermediate structures, such as rails <b>34</b>, which are, in turn, coupled to the walls <b>14</b> <i>a</i>-<b>14</b> <i>d. </i> </p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 2, the latching structures <b>26</b> are undone and the opposing side walls <b>14</b> <i>a</i>-<b>14</b> <i>d </i>are hinged downwardly to fold against the base <b>12</b> and preferably inwardly on the base when the container <b>10</b> is collapsed. When the side walls are moved to the collapsed position to reduce the size of the container <b>10</b>, the support cables <b>32</b> are relaxed such that the dunnage pouches <b>40</b> fall down into a collapsed positioned and onto the base or the bottom <b>12</b> of container <b>10</b>. FIG. 2 illustrates side wall <b>14</b> <i>a </i>in a collapsed position. Similarly, opposing sidewall <b>14</b> <i>c </i>also moves to a collapsed position such that the dunnage pouches <b>40</b> relax onto the base <b>12</b> of the container with the side walls <b>14</b> <i>a, </i> <b>14</b> <i>c </i>covering the dunnage pouches <b>40</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 1C illustrates an alternative embodiment of the support rail <b>34</b> which might be utilized. Rail <b>35</b> is a flexible element, such as a cable, and is fastened between support structures <b>44</b> to suspend the support cables <b>32</b>. Alternatively, the ends of the rail cable <b>35</b> might be fixed directly to the side walls <b>14</b> <i>a</i>-<b>14</b> <i>d </i>of the container, as appropriate, as illustrated in FIG. 1B for example. This would eliminate the need for structures <b>44</b>.</p>
    <p>Preferably, the dunnage pouches <b>40</b> are made of pliable fabric or plastic of suitable strength which readily relaxes with the flexible support cables <b>32</b> when the side walls are collapsed yet has sufficient strength for supporting and protecting the shipped product when the side walls are erected to form the container <b>10</b>. The support rails <b>34</b> are positioned at the top edges <b>33</b> of the side walls in order to suspend the pouches generally above base <b>12</b> in the erected container <b>10</b>. Suspending the dunnage pouches <b>40</b> above base <b>12</b> will prevent the product in the pouches from bouncing against the base when the container is shipped. However, the pouches <b>40</b> might be attached at their bottom ends (not shown) to base <b>12</b> to keep the pouches from moving around during shipment.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 3, when the side walls <b>14</b> <i>a </i>and <b>14</b> <i>c </i>have been collapsed, the other opposing sides walls <b>14</b> <i>b </i>and <b>14</b> <i>d </i>are then collapsed to overlap side walls <b>14</b> <i>a, </i> <b>14</b> <i>c. </i>Side walls <b>14</b> <i>b </i>and <b>14</b> <i>d </i>are moved to a collapsed position to overlap the already collapsed side walls <b>14</b> <i>a, </i> <b>14</b> <i>c </i>and the dunnage pouches <b>40</b> to thereby contain the dunnage pouches within the container when it is returned. Preferably, the opposing side walls <b>14</b> <i>b, </i> <b>14</b> <i>d </i>that will form the top of the collapsed container will hinge from a position slightly above the overlapped collapsed side walls to form a flat, stackable return container. Referring to FIG. 3, a vertical allowance <b>50</b> is made on the base <b>12</b> so that side walls <b>14</b> <i>b, </i> <b>14</b> <i>d </i>may easily overlap the collapsed side walls <b>14</b> <i>a, </i> <b>14</b> <i>c </i>and thus lie flat and flush with the top of the return container <b>10</b>. Preferably, the collapsed container <b>10</b> will have approximately one-third (⅓) the height of an erected container so that generally three collapsed and returned containers can be shipped back to the manufacturer in a space or volume normally occupied by one fully erected container. In that way, shipping costs are reduced and generally three collapsed containers can be returned for the price a single erected container (i.e., a 3:1 return-to-shipment ratio). Additionally, the collapsed containers occupy significantly less storage space per unit thereby reducing storage costs as well as reducing shipping costs.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the container <b>10</b> of the invention provides integral reusable dunnage structures which remain with the reusable container <b>10</b> when it is shipped full of product and also when it is returned for reuse. Simply by erecting the container for shipment, the dunnage structures are moved into place in their engagement position by the support structures, like cables <b>32</b>, and are ready to receive product therein. No additional steps or labor is required to assemble and construct the dunnage structures or to position the dunnage structures within the container <b>10</b>. The dunnage structures of the invention, which are illustrated as dunnage pouches <b>40</b> in the preferred embodiment of FIGS. 1-3, will automatically be suspended within the container to receive product upon erecting the side walls <b>14</b> <i>a</i>-<b>14</b> <i>d. </i>Furthermore, the dunnage pouches <b>40</b> do not have to be removed from the container <b>10</b> when the container is collapsed for return shipment and reuse. Simply moving the side walls to a collapsed position to the reduce the size of the container automatically relaxes the dunnage pouches <b>40</b> into the base <b>12</b> of the container <b>10</b> for return shipment along with the container. It is no longer necessary to utilize labor resources to remove, disassemble, and dispose of the dunnage structures thereby resulting in substantial labor cost savings for the assembly plant or other customer. Furthermore, disposal costs are eliminated because the dunnage structures are reused along with the container and do not have to be recycled or wasted. When the container is erected, the dunnage pouches <b>40</b> adequately engage, support and protect the product shipped in the container to prevent damage thereto. Therefore, the reusable and returnable container with collapsible reusable dunnage provides substantial shipment, storage, labor and materials cost savings to both the product manufacturer shipping the product and the customer who must return the reusable container to the manufacturer.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 4, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> illustrate alternative embodiments of collapsible container structures with integrally supported dunnage structures in accordance with the principles of the present invention.</p>
    <p>FIG. 4 illustrates a shipping rack container or rack <b>60</b> which includes a frame having a generally rectangular bottom or base member <b>62</b> and a somewhat similarly-shaped top member <b>64</b> positioned vertically above the base member <b>62</b>. Collapsible legs <b>66</b> extend between the base member <b>62</b> and top member <b>64</b> and include hinge elements <b>68</b> along their length to provide for collapsing of the legs <b>66</b> along a hinge axis <b>70</b>. The legs are hingedly coupled to the base members <b>62</b> and top member <b>64</b> by appropriate fasteners, such as rivets or pines <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>, respectively, for hinging the legs along axes <b>73</b> and <b>75</b>. The sides of the frame are generally open.</p>
    <p>FIG. 4 illustrates the rack container or rack <b>60</b> of the invention in an erected position for containing and shipping product therein. In accordance with the principles of the present invention, two opposing sides <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> of the top member <b>64</b> include elongated support rail elements <b>78</b>, which extend generally the entire length of the sides <b>74</b>, <b>76</b>. Flexible support structures or cables <b>80</b> span between the rail elements <b>78</b> of sides <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> and support dunnage structures, such as dunnage pouches <b>82</b>, on the rack <b>60</b>. When the frame of rack <b>60</b> is erected, i.e., when the collapsible legs <b>66</b> are in an erected position, the dunnage pouches <b>82</b> are suspended by the cables <b>80</b> generally above the base member <b>62</b> of the rack <b>60</b>. As disclosed above, the pouches <b>40</b> are preferably made of a strong, pliable fabric of cloth or plastic and are sewn or heat sealed at top edges thereof to the cables <b>80</b>. Preferably, tensioning elements such as springs <b>83</b> provide tension on the cables <b>80</b> for proper support of the dunnage pouches <b>82</b> when filled with product. When a product is placed within the dunnage pouches <b>82</b>, it is protected from abrasion and damage during shipment. Similar to the dunnage pouches <b>40</b> in FIGS. 1-3, the dunnage pouches <b>82</b> each have any opening <b>84</b> formed between adjacent support cables <b>80</b>. Once product is loaded into the pouches <b>82</b> with the frame of rack <b>60</b> in the erected position, the product is ready for shipment either in a single rack or in several racks stacked one on top of another or positioned side-by-side, such as in a truck. The bottom member <b>62</b> of the frame may include appropriately formed openings <b>86</b> to received the forks of a forklift.</p>
    <p>When the customer has unloaded all of the product from the dunnage pouches <b>82</b>, rack <b>60</b> is collapsible for return shipment to the manufacturer for reuse in future shipments. To that end, the legs <b>66</b> of the rack frame are operable to hinge such that the legs fold inwardly toward the center of the rack as illustrated in FIG. <b>5</b>. Locking structures (not shown) might be utilized with the leg hinge elements <b>68</b> to lock the legs in an erected position <b>66</b> and to subsequently be engaged to collapse the frame legs <b>66</b>. To collapse the legs <b>66</b>, they are pushed inwardly in the direction of arrow <b>67</b> to fold at the hinge elements <b>68</b>. The top ends of the legs pivot along axis <b>75</b>, while the bottom ends pivot along axis <b>73</b> so that the legs <b>66</b> may be folded as illustrated in FIG. <b>5</b>.</p>
    <p>When all of the legs <b>66</b> are simultaneously folded to a collapsed position, the top member <b>64</b> is lowered to a position adjacent to and above the base member <b>62</b>. The collapsed legs <b>66</b> fold inwardly toward the center of rack <b>60</b> and are effectively sandwiched between the top member <b>64</b> and base member <b>62</b>. The pliable dunnage pouches <b>82</b> are operable to relax to a collapsed position when the rack is collapsed to provide a return rack complete with dunnage, which occupies substantially less space than the erected rack. Referring to FIG. 5, the pliable pouches <b>82</b> fold or crumple when the top member <b>64</b> is lowered. Preferably, the collapsed rack is only about one-third (⅓) of the height of the erected rack so that three stacked and empty racks may be returned or stored in the same space normally occupied by an erected rack full of product.</p>
    <p>The dunnage pouches <b>82</b> are coupled to the rack frame and particularly to the top member <b>64</b> of the rack frame to remain with the rack whether collapsed or erected. When the rack is again erected, the dunnage pouches <b>82</b> are again suspended generally above the base member <b>62</b> by cables <b>80</b> so that product placed in the pouches will be protected by the pouches and the rack <b>60</b> during shipment. Unlike the embodiment of the container of FIGS. 1-3, cables <b>80</b> of rack <b>60</b> span between the ends <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> of top member <b>64</b> regardless of whether the rack is erected or collapsed because the ends <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> do not hinge or fold inwardly to the center of the rack. That is, cables <b>80</b> remain under tension whether the frame of rack <b>60</b> is collapsed or erected. The rack <b>60</b> illustrated in the FIGS. 4-5 will be utilized for transporting large parts, such as automobile door panels or the like and thus will generally be lifted by a machine such as a forklift.</p>
    <p>Like the container of FIGS. 1-3, rack container <b>60</b> might also utilize dunnage structures other than those shown in FIGS. 4 and 5. For example, cable attachments in FIGS. 1A, <b>1</b>B or <b>1</b>C might be utilized. Similarly, the pouches or other dunnage structures might be fixed or otherwise coupled directly to the top member <b>64</b> in a fashion similar to that shown in FIG. <b>1</b>D.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5A illustrates an alternative collapsible leg structure for collapsing rack <b>60</b>. Leg <b>87</b> is configured for telescoping to a shorter length for collapsing rack <b>60</b>. To that end, leg <b>87</b> includes telescoping segments <b>88</b> <i>a, </i> <b>88</b> <i>b, </i> <b>88</b> <i>c </i>and <b>88</b> <i>d. </i>The bottom segment <b>88</b> <i>d </i>is coupled to base member <b>62</b> while the top segment <b>88</b> <i>a </i>is mounted to top member <b>64</b>. The top segment <b>88</b> <i>a </i>is fixed to top member <b>64</b> by a stand-off structure <b>89</b> for ensuring that the leg segments will nest properly without interfering with the top member when the rack <b>60</b> is collapsed and the legs <b>87</b> are telescoped to their shorter length. The leg <b>87</b> includes ball detentes <b>91</b> or other appropriate structures which hold the leg in the erected position. The ball detentes <b>91</b> are engaged appropriately to collapse leg <b>87</b>.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 6 and 7 illustrate another embodiment of the container of the present invention which is formed as a tote box container or tote container capable of being manually handled and carried. The tote box container <b>90</b> of the invention comprises a generally flat base or bottom member <b>92</b> which is generally rectangular and forms a floor of the container <b>90</b> and a top member <b>94</b> which is also generally rectangular and is open so that product may be placed in and removed from the container. Pairs of opposing side walls <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> and <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> form the sides of container <b>90</b>. The sides walls <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> are hingedly coupled to the top member <b>94</b> to hinge or swing upwardly and downwardly with respect to the top member and around axis <b>104</b>. For example, the side walls <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> might be coupled to the top member <b>94</b> by pins (not shown) extending from side edges of the side walls <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> to fit into hinge holes <b>97</b> formed in top member <b>94</b> so that the side walls pivot at their top edges with respect to the top member <b>94</b>.</p>
    <p>In the erected position as shown in FIG. 6, the side walls <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> are swung downwardly away from the top member <b>94</b> to extend between the top member <b>94</b> and base member <b>92</b> generally perpendicular to the planes of both of these members. The other pair of opposing side walls <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> include upper and lower sections <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, respectively, which are coupled together at an intermediate hinge structure <b>109</b> so that the side walls <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> may fold inwardly toward the center of container <b>90</b> when the container is collapsed (see FIG. <b>7</b>). To that end, the side walls <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> are hinged along their upper edge <b>1</b> <b>10</b> to top member <b>94</b>. Appropriate hinge structures (not shown) couple the side walls <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> to the top member <b>94</b> so that the side walls <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> hinge along an axis <b>111</b>. For example, the side walls might include pins (not shown) which are received in hinge holes <b>113</b> in top member <b>94</b>. The bottom edges <b>112</b> of the side walls <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> are also hingedly attached to bottom member <b>92</b> by an appropriate hinging structure (not shown) so that the side walls <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> hinge with respect to base member <b>92</b> along axis <b>115</b>. The top edge <b>110</b> corresponds to the top edge of upper section <b>106</b>, while the bottom edge <b>112</b> corresponds to the bottom edge of bottom section <b>108</b>.</p>
    <p>Tote container <b>90</b> includes collapsible and reusable dunnage similar to the dunnage included in the containers previously disclosed herein in accordance with the principles of the invention. That is, dunnage is positioned in the tote <b>90</b> and is movable between an engagement positioned and a collapsed position when the tote <b>90</b> is erected and collapsed, respectively. In one version, flexible support cables <b>114</b> span between rails <b>116</b> which are fixed to opposing ends <b>117</b>, <b>119</b> of the top member <b>94</b>. Alternatively, as illustrated in FIG. 1B, the cables <b>114</b> might be fixed directly to the top member <b>94</b> thus eliminating the rail elements <b>115</b>. The rails <b>116</b> are fixed directly to the top member <b>94</b> or alternatively might be held thereto by supporting structures similar to structures <b>44</b> shown in FIG. <b>1</b>. Furthermore, rails <b>116</b> may be rigid, or they may be flexible cables as illustrated in FIG. <b>1</b>C. The cables <b>114</b> span between the ends <b>117</b>, <b>119</b> of the top member <b>94</b> and provide support structures for pliable dunnage structures, such as dunnage pouches <b>118</b>, suspended from the cables <b>114</b>. The dunnage pouches <b>118</b> are similar to those already discussed. As discussed above, each cable preferably includes at least one tensioning element, such as spring <b>121</b>, to provide proper tension on the cables <b>114</b> for proper support of the dunnage pouches when they contain product therein. Preferably, the dunnage pouches <b>118</b> are supported so that, when the container <b>90</b> is erected, they are suspended above the base member <b>92</b> of the container. The pouches <b>118</b> may also be fixed to the base member <b>92</b> to hold them in position when the container is shipped full of product.</p>
    <p>When the tote container <b>90</b> of the invention is erected, top member <b>94</b> is raised above base member <b>92</b> and the side walls <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> are folded outwardly from the center of the container. Preferably, the hinge structures <b>109</b> lock the side walls <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> into an erected position such that the upper section <b>106</b> and bottom section <b>108</b> are generally coextensive with each other to form each side wall <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>. The other opposing side walls <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> are then swung downwardly about axis <b>104</b> in the direction of arrow <b>123</b> to form a tote container <b>90</b> which is contained on all sides by solid side walls to protect products placed within the container <b>90</b> as illustrated in FIG. <b>6</b>.</p>
    <p>When the product shipped in tote container <b>90</b> has been emptied from the dunnage pouches <b>118</b>, the tote container may be collapsed to a smaller size for return shipment to the manufacturer to be reused. Referring to FIG. 7, the tote container <b>90</b> is collapsed by first hinging or swinging the side walls <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> upwardly along axis <b>104</b> and in the direction of arrow <b>125</b> to a generally horizontal position parallel to a plane defined by top member <b>94</b>. In doing so, the pliable dunnage pouches <b>118</b> are pushed upwardly by the side walls <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>. The dunnage pouches are preferably formed of a resilient, pliable material as discussed hereinabove and will generally lie in a compressed or relaxed state on the top of collapsed side walls <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> adjacent top member <b>94</b> as shown in FIG. <b>7</b>.</p>
    <p>Next, the side walls <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> are hinged inwardly at hinge <b>109</b> in the direction of arrows <b>127</b> so that the side walls <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> fold inwardly toward the center of the tote container <b>90</b> to be sandwiched between the top member <b>94</b> and base member <b>92</b>. If the hinge structures <b>109</b> include a locking device (not shown) to keep the side walls <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> erect, the locking device must be disengaged before collapsing the side walls. When the tote container <b>90</b> is collapsed, and the sides walls <b>100</b>,<b>102</b> fold, the top edges <b>110</b> of the side walls also hinge along axis line <b>111</b> with respect to the top member <b>94</b>, and the lower edges <b>112</b> along the axis line <b>113</b> with respect to the base member <b>92</b>. Referring to FIG. 7, the top member <b>94</b> is lowered against base member <b>92</b> and the folded side walls <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> will lie between the top member <b>94</b> and bottom member <b>92</b> to form a collapsed tote container which has a shorter vertical height than the erected container. Preferably, the collapsed container has a height which is only approximately one-fourth (¼) of the height of the erected container to provide a four-to-one (4:1) return-to-shipment ratio. However, the container might be configured to collapse to a shorter size for a higher return-to-shipment ratio. Referring to FIG. 7, the height of collapsed container <b>90</b> will comprise the height of top member <b>94</b> along with the height of the bottom member <b>92</b>, with dunnage pouches <b>118</b> resting on the collapsed side walls <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> generally parallel to top member <b>94</b>.</p>
    <p>In accordance with the principles of the present invention, the dunnage is maintained within the tote container <b>90</b> and is moved into an engagement position simply by reversing the collapsing technique. That is, the top member <b>94</b> is lifted away from the base member <b>92</b> so that the side walls <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> fold outwardly at hinge structures <b>109</b>. Subsequently, the side walls <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> swing downwardly to form the complete erected body of the container <b>90</b>. When the side walls <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> are moved to an erected position, the dunnage pouches <b>118</b> drop downwardly into the container to be suspended from the flexible support cables <b>114</b> in the engagement position, and are then configured to contain and protect product shipped or stored in the tote container. Alternatively, the pouches may be coupled directly to top member <b>94</b> as illustrated in FIG. <b>1</b>D.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 8 and 9 illustrate another version of the tote container wherein tote <b>130</b> is formed preferably from a unitary blank so that the various side walls are integrally connected together. Tote <b>130</b> comprises a body with side walls <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> and hingeable side walls <b>136</b>, <b>138</b>. The top edges <b>140</b> of the side walls <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> are coupled to the tote body by a hinge or score line <b>141</b> to swing toward the top of the container to collapse the tote (FIG. <b>9</b>). The bottom edge <b>143</b> and side edges <b>145</b> are free to allow movement of the side walls <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> as described. The hingeable side walls <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> are coupled to the tote container body at the top edge <b>146</b> and bottom edge <b>147</b> by hinge lines <b>148</b>, <b>149</b>, respectively. An intermediate hinge line <b>150</b> provides foldable hinging of the side walls <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> as previously discussed. Tote container <b>130</b> includes dunnage structures <b>152</b> in accordance with the principles of the invention, which are attached to the tote container to operate with the container as previously described.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 9, the tote container collapsed with dunnage therein in a similar fashion as the embodiment of FIGS. 6 and 7 to form a collapsed tote container which is substantially smaller than an erected container. The version of the tote container <b>130</b> would be relatively simpler and cheaper to manufacture because of its integral construction. The tote container <b>130</b> might be die cut and scored as appropriate and may be made of a corrugated paperboard or corrugated plastic construction.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 10 and 11 illustrate another alternative embodiment of the container in the invention. The container <b>160</b> of FIG. 10 is commonly referred to as a sleeve pack container and comprises a sleeve <b>162</b> which, when erected, fits into a pallet base <b>164</b> and is covered by a cover or top <b>166</b> to form a complete container. Pallet base <b>164</b> preferably has forklift openings <b>167</b> for handling container <b>160</b>.</p>
    <p>Sleeve <b>162</b> may be formed of a corrugated paperboard or corrugated plastic and has a plurality of vertical score lines or hinge lines formed therein. More particularly, the sleeve has opposing sets of side walls <b>170</b>, <b>172</b>. The side walls are hingedly connected at their side edges by hinge lines <b>174</b> for forming the sleeve <b>162</b>. Alternatively, hinge structures (not shown) might be utilized as shown in patent application U.S. Ser. No. 08/412,141 entitled SLEEVE PACK ASSEMBLY which illustrates a sleeve pack design appropriate for practicing the invention, and which application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Vertical hinge lines <b>176</b> are also formed intermediate the sides of side walls <b>172</b> for collapsing the side walls <b>172</b> as discussed below.</p>
    <p>Sleeve <b>162</b> contains integral collapsible dunnage in accordance with the principles of the invention. To that end, sleeve <b>162</b> comprises a plurality of dunnage pouches <b>178</b> which, in one version, are suspended by flexible cables <b>179</b> coupled to rails <b>180</b> by tension elements <b>181</b>. Alternatively, the pouches may be coupled directly to side walls <b>170</b> (see FIG. <b>1</b>D). The pouches <b>178</b> are suspended in sleeve <b>162</b> to contain and protect product. Greater detail on the pouches is disclosed above.</p>
    <p>Sleeve <b>162</b>, when erected as shown in FIG. 10, fits into a peripheral groove <b>182</b> formed in pallet base <b>164</b>. The groove <b>182</b> and rigidity of base <b>164</b> maintain the sleeve erect when the pouches are loaded with product. In an alternative version, a collapsible reinforcement bar or strip <b>184</b> might be utilized along the top edge of the collapsible side walls <b>172</b> (see FIG. <b>10</b>). When container <b>160</b> is fully assembled, cover <b>166</b> is placed on the top of sleeve <b>162</b> to fully contain the products in pouches <b>178</b> to prepare them for shipment.</p>
    <p>To collapse container <b>160</b>, cover <b>166</b> is removed and the sleeve <b>162</b> is lifted from base <b>164</b>. The side walls <b>172</b> are then folded inwardly along hinge lines <b>176</b> as shown in FIG. 11 to collapse the sleeve <b>162</b>. In doing so, the reinforcement bar <b>184</b> must also be collapsed or moved out of the way as appropriate. When sleeve <b>162</b> is thus collapsed, the pouches <b>178</b> are held between the side walls <b>170</b> which are moved closer together to flatten the sleeve <b>162</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 11, the reinforcement bar <b>184</b> might be a rigid bar which does not fold or collapse. In such a case, the bar might be pivotally attached at one side <b>185</b> and may swing down to a vertical position as shown in FIG. 11 for collapsing sleeve <b>162</b>. To erect the sleeve <b>162</b>, the bar <b>184</b> is swung back into a horizontal position proximate the top edge of the sleeve and held in place by a clip <b>186</b> or other structure (see FIG. <b>10</b>).</p>
    <p>When sleeve <b>162</b> is collapsed, the dunnage pouches <b>179</b> collapse between side walls <b>170</b>. The pliable pouches <b>178</b>, and flexible cables <b>179</b>, if utilized, allow the sleeve to fold down to a relatively thin shape for return shipment. The sleeves may then be stacked flat with the base and cover for a higher return ratio. The collapsed sleeve contains the dunnage therein when returned, and the dunnage will be constructed back into the engagement position when the sleeve is erected.</p>
    <p>While the present invention has been illustrated by a description of various embodiments and while these embodiments have been described in considerable detail, it is not the intention of the applicants to restrict or in any way limit the scope of the appended claims to such detail. Additional advantages and modifications will readily appear to those skilled in the art. For example, the dunnage structures used in the invention might be structures other than the pouches which would similarly be erected and collapsed when the container is erected and collapsed. The invention in its broader aspects is therefore limited only by the claims herein. Accordingly, departures may be made from the detailed description without departing from the spirit or scope of applicant's general inventive concept.</p>
