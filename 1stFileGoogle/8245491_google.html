No. 60/859,192, filed Nov. 15, 2006 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/860,272, filed Nov. 21, 2006, the contents of both of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">The present invention relates to heat recovery systems and, more particularly, to an exhaust gas waste heat recovery system and a method of operating the same.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY</heading> <p num="p-0004">In some embodiments, the present invention provides a heat recovery system for use in a vehicle to convert waste heat energy generated during engine operation into electric power. The heat recovery system can include two or three heat exchangers enclosed in a housing and arranged along a flow path.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">In some embodiments, exhaust from the vehicle engine and a working fluid travel through a first heat exchanger along substantially counter-directional flow paths. Exhaust from the vehicle engine and the working fluid can travel along substantially parallel flow paths through a second heat exchanger and/or a third heat exchanger.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">The heat recovery system can also include a valve arrangement for controlling the flow of a working fluid along the flow path. In some embodiments, the valve arrangement can be operable to alter the flow path of the working fluid based upon a characteristic (e.g., a temperature, pressure, volume, etc.) of exhaust entering the heat recovery system.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">In some embodiments, the present invention provides a heat recovery system for use with a vehicle. The heat recovery system can include a volume of a working fluid, a housing enclosing a first heat exchanger, a second heat exchanger, and a third heat exchanger, and a flow path extending between the first, second, and third heat exchangers. In some embodiments, the flow path can be a first flow path, and the heat recovery system can include a second flow path, a first portion of which can be substantially parallel to the first flow path and a second portion of which can be substantially non-parallel or counter to the first flow path.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">In some embodiments, the present invention provides a heat recovery system including a volume of working fluid and a first heat exchanger, a second heat exchanger, and a third heat exchanger connected in a single integral unit. The heat recovery system can also include a flow path extending between the first, second, and third heat exchangers.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">The present invention also provides a method of operating a heat recovery system including the acts of directing a working fluid and vehicle engine exhaust through a first heat exchanger along substantially counter-directional flow paths and directing the working fluid and the exhaust through a second heat exchanger and a third heat exchanger along a substantially parallel flow path. The method can also include the act of adjusting the flow of the working fluid in response to a change in a characteristic (e.g., the temperature, pressure, flow rate, etc.) of exhaust traveling through the heat recovery system.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">In some embodiments, the present invention provides a heat recovery system for use with a vehicle. The heat recovery system can house a working fluid and can include a first heat exchanger, a turbine, and a housing enclosing a second heat exchanger and a condenser. The housing can also enclose a third heat exchanger and a vent arrangement for venting vapor from the working fluid. In some embodiments, the first working fluid travels through the housing along a first flow path and a second working fluid travels through the housing along a second flow path, a portion of which is substantially counter to the first flow path.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">In addition, the present invention provides a heat recovery system including a flow path extending through a first heat exchanger, a turbine, a pump, and a housing enclosing a second heat exchanger and a third heat exchanger. In some embodiments, a working fluid traveling along the flow path exits the housing after traveling through the second heat exchanger, travels through a pump, and reenters the housing before returning to the second heat exchanger.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">In some embodiments, the present invention provides a heat recovery system including a flow path, which houses a working fluid and extends through a first heat exchanger, a turbine, a pump, and a housing enclosing a second heat exchanger and a vent arrangement.

The flow of working fluid along the second portion of the working fluid flow path can be substantially parallel to the flow of exhaust along the exhaust flow path adjacent to the second portion of the working fluid flow path. The heat recovery system can also include a heat transfer circuit extending between a turbine outlet and the working fluid flow path.</p>
    <p num="p-0017">In addition, the present invention provides a method of recovering waste heat from exhaust.

    <p num="p-0034">The heat recovery system <b>10</b> can include a heat transfer circuit <b>12</b> having a volume of a first or working fluid (e.g., R245fa, water, CO<sub>2</sub>, an organic refrigerant, and the like) (represented by arrows <b>14</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>). In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the heat transfer circuit <b>12</b> extends between and fluidly connects a recuperator <b>16</b>, a first heat exchanger or preheater <b>18</b>, a second heat exchanger or vaporizer <b>20</b>, a third heat exchanger or superheater <b>22</b>, a turbine <b>24</b>, and a condenser <b>26</b>. In some embodiments, the heat transfer circuit <b>12</b> can also include one or more pumps positioned along the heat transfer circuit <b>12</b> for maintaining fluid pressure in the heat transfer circuit <b>12</b> or a portion of the heat transfer circuit <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0035">In some embodiments, such as the illustrated embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the preheater <b>18</b>, the vaporizer <b>20</b>, and the superheater <b>22</b> can be enclosed or at least partially enclosed in a single integral housing <b>32</b>. In other embodiments, two of the preheater <b>18</b>, the vaporizer <b>20</b>, and the superheater <b>22</b> can be enclosed or at least partially enclosed in the housing <b>32</b>. In still other embodiments, each of the preheater <b>18</b>, the vaporizer <b>20</b>, and the superheater <b>22</b> can be separately housed. In such embodiments, the preheater <b>18</b>, the vaporizer <b>20</b>, and the superheater <b>22</b> can be grouped together in a single location on the vehicle, or alternatively, the preheater <b>18</b>, the vaporizer <b>20</b>, and the superheater <b>22</b> can be distributed in different locations around the vehicle, such as, for example, under the vehicle frame, in the vehicle engine compartment, in the vehicle cargo space, and in the vehicle passenger space.</p>
    <p num="p-0036">Alternatively or in addition, the preheater <b>18</b>, the vaporizer <b>20</b>, and the superheater <b>22</b> can be connected in a single integral unit and/or assembled as a unit prior to installation in a vehicle or building. In other embodiments, two of the preheater <b>18</b>, the vaporizer <b>20</b>, and the superheater <b>22</b> can be connected in a single integral unit and/or assembled as a unit prior to instillation in a vehicle or building.</p>
    <p num="p-0037">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in embodiments in which the preheater <b>18</b>, the vaporizer <b>20</b>, and the superheater <b>22</b> are enclosed in the housing <b>32</b>, the preheater <b>18</b>, the vaporizer <b>20</b>, and the superheater <b>22</b> can be integrally formed so that each of the preheater <b>18</b>, the vaporizer <b>20</b>, and the superheater <b>22</b> defines a section of an integral main heat exchanger <b>34</b>. In some such embodiments, the working fluid <b>14</b> can be vaporized and superheated while traveling through the main heat exchanger <b>34</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0038">In some embodiments, the main heat exchanger <b>34</b> can have a bar and plate configuration defining a first flow path <b>38</b> for the working fluid <b>14</b> and a second flow path <b>42</b> for exhaust (represented by arrows <b>44</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) from the vehicle engine. In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the main heat exchanger <b>34</b> is a stainless steel heat exchanger having three working fluid flow passes and three exhaust flow passes, a 6.5 mm square wave fin on an air side, and a 3.0 mm lanced offset fin on a working fluid side.</p>
    <p num="p-0039">In some embodiments, including embodiments in which the preheater <b>18</b>, the vaporizer <b>20</b>, and the superheater <b>22</b> are enclosed in the housing <b>32</b>, embodiments in which the vaporizer <b>20</b>, and the superheater <b>22</b> can be connected in a single integral unit or assembled as a unit prior to instillation, and embodiments in which the preheater <b>18</b>, vaporizer <b>20</b>, and superheater <b>22</b> are distributed around the vehicle, one or more of the preheater <b>18</b>, vaporizer <b>20</b>, and superheater <b>22</b> can have a different configuration (e.g., shape, size, and orientation, fin and tube, tube-in-tube, and the like) and can be manufactured from other materials (e.g., aluminum, iron, and other metals, composite material, and the like) having other heat transfer coefficients.</p>
    <p num="p-0040">In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, a first portion of the main heat exchanger <b>34</b> is configured as a counter-flow heat exchanger and a second portion of the main heat exchanger <b>34</b> is configured as a parallel-flow heat exchanger. More specifically, in the illustrated embodiment, the preheater <b>18</b> is configured as a counter-flow heat exchanger and the vaporizer <b>20</b> and the superheater <b>22</b> are configured as parallel-flow heat exchangers.</p>
    <p num="p-0041">In other embodiments, all or substantially all of the main heat exchanger <b>34</b> can be configured as a parallel-flow heat exchanger. Such a heat exchanger includes at least two flow paths in which the first working fluid <b>14</b> and the exhaust <b>44</b> flow in the same direction. Alternatively all or substantially all of the main heat exchanger <b>34</b> can be configured as a counter-flow heat exchanger. In still other embodiments, the preheater <b>18</b> can have a parallel-flow configuration and the vaporizer <b>20</b> and the superheater <b>22</b> can have a counter-flow configuration. In yet other embodiments, each of the preheater <b>18</b>, the vaporizer <b>20</b>, and the superheater <b>22</b> can have a different flow configuration.</p>
    <p num="p-0042">In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the working fluid <b>14</b> enters the preheater <b>18</b> through an inlet <b>48</b> in the preheater <b>18</b> at between about 110° C. and about 130° C. and exhaust <b>44</b> enters the preheater at between about 240° C. and about 260° C. In other embodiments, the working fluid <b>14</b> can have other temperatures, depending upon the flow characteristics (e.g., flow rate, temperature, pressure, etc.) of the exhaust <b>44</b>, the particular working fluid <b>14</b> selected and the characteristics (e.g., boiling-point temperature, chemical-breakdown temperature, etc.) of the working fluid <b>14</b>, the mass flow rate of the working fluid <b>14</b> through the heat transfer circuit <b>12</b>, and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0043">From the inlet <b>48</b>, the working fluid <b>14</b> travels through the first flow path <b>38</b> through the preheater <b>18</b> toward an outlet <b>50</b> of the preheater <b>18</b>. Exhaust <b>44</b> travels through the second flow path <b>42</b> of the preheater <b>18</b> toward an exhaust outlet <b>52</b>. As the working fluid <b>14</b> and the exhaust <b>44</b> travel through the preheater <b>18</b> along respective first and second flow paths <b>38</b>, <b>42</b>, the preheater <b>18</b> transfers heat energy from the exhaust <b>44</b> to the working fluid <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0044">From the outlet <b>50</b> of the preheater <b>18</b>, the working fluid <b>14</b> travels along the first flow path <b>38</b> and through a bypass <b>56</b> to an inlet <b>58</b> of the vaporizer <b>20</b>. In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the working fluid <b>14</b> enters the vaporizer <b>20</b> through the inlet <b>58</b> at between about 140° C. and about 160° C. and the exhaust <b>44</b> enters the second flow path <b>42</b> through an inlet <b>62</b> in the vaporizer <b>20</b> at between about 570° C. and about 590° C.</p>
    <p num="p-0045">In some embodiments, the temperature of the working fluid <b>14</b> at the inlet <b>62</b> is about 150° C. In other embodiments, the working fluid <b>14</b> can have other temperatures, depending upon the flow characteristics (e.g., flow rate, temperature, pressure, etc.) of the exhaust <b>44</b>, the particular working fluid <b>14</b> selected and the characteristics (e.g., boiling point temperature, chemical breakdown temperature, etc.) of the working fluid <b>14</b>, the mass flow rate of the working fluid <b>14</b> through the heat transfer circuit <b>12</b>, and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0046">Because the working fluid <b>14</b> has been heated prior to entering the vaporizer <b>20</b>, the temperature gradient at the inlet <b>58</b> of the vaporizer <b>20</b> is reduced significantly (e.g., in some embodiments, by as much as about 10% or between about 30° C. and about 40° C.). In some embodiments, the temperature gradient at the inlet <b>58</b> between the first working fluid <b>14</b> and the exhaust <b>44</b> can be reduced by as much as 32° C. In this manner, the thermal stresses experienced by the main heat exchanger <b>34</b>, and particularly the vaporizer <b>20</b> and superheater <b>22</b>, can be minimized and the fatigue life of the heat recovery system <b>10</b> can be improved.</p>
    <p num="p-0047">With continued reference to the illustrated embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the working fluid <b>14</b> and the exhaust <b>44</b> then travel along substantially parallel portions of respective first and second flow paths <b>38</b>, <b>42</b> toward the superheater <b>22</b>. The working fluid <b>14</b> can enter an inlet <b>62</b> of the superheater <b>22</b> at between about 160° C. and about 180° C. and the exhaust <b>44</b> can enter an inlet <b>64</b> of the superheater <b>22</b> at between about 490° C. and about 460° C. In other embodiments, the working fluid <b>14</b> can have other temperatures, depending upon the flow characteristics (e.g., flow rate, temperature, pressure, etc.) of the exhaust <b>44</b>, the particular working fluid <b>14</b> selected and the characteristics (e.g., boiling point temperature, chemical breakdown temperature, etc.) of the working fluid <b>14</b>, the mass flow rate of the working fluid <b>14</b> through the heat transfer circuit <b>12</b>, and the like. Similarly, in other embodiments, the exhaust <b>44</b> can have other temperatures, depending upon the flow characteristics (e.g., flow rate, temperature, pressure, etc.) of the working fluid <b>14</b>, the particular working fluid <b>14</b> selected and the characteristics (e.g., boiling point temperature, chemical breakdown temperature, etc.) of the working fluid <b>14</b>, the mass flow rate of the working fluid <b>14</b> through the heat transfer circuit <b>12</b>, and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0048">As the working fluid <b>14</b> and the exhaust <b>44</b> travel through the superheater <b>22</b>, the superheater <b>22</b> transfers heat energy from the exhaust <b>44</b> to the working fluid <b>14</b>, thereby raising the temperature of the working fluid <b>14</b> exiting the superheater <b>22</b> through an outlet <b>66</b> in the superheater <b>22</b>. In some embodiments, the temperature of the working fluid <b>14</b> is raised in this manner to between about 220° C. and about 230° C. In some embodiments, the temperature of the working fluid <b>14</b> at the outlet <b>66</b> is about 227° C. In other embodiments, the working fluid <b>14</b> can have other temperatures, depending upon the flow characteristics (e.g., flow rate, temperature, pressure, etc.) of the exhaust <b>44</b>, the particular working fluid <b>14</b> selected and the characteristics (e.g., boiling point temperature, chemical breakdown temperature, etc.) of the working fluid <b>14</b>, the mass flow rate of the working fluid <b>14</b> through the heat transfer circuit <b>12</b>, and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0049">In some embodiments, such as the illustrated embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> in which the superheater <b>22</b> has a parallel flow configuration, the superheater <b>22</b> can pinch the temperature of the working fluid <b>14</b> so that the temperature of the working fluid <b>14</b> exiting the superheater <b>22</b> is maintained within a relatively small temperature range (e.g., between about 220° C. and about 230° C.) despite potential fluctuations in exhaust temperature, exhaust flow rates, and ambient temperatures, thereby improving the efficiency of the turbine <b>24</b> and preventing the working fluid <b>14</b> from reaching a chemical breakdown temperature (e.g., about 260° C. for R245fa).</p>
    <p num="p-0050">In some embodiments, one or both of the exhaust temperature, exhaust pressure, and exhaust flow rate can vary significantly based upon vehicle engine conditions, including the amount of fuel supplied to the engine over a given time. In some such embodiments, the superheater <b>22</b> can be oversized (e.g., by at least as much as about 25% above normal operating requirements) so that when gas flow is interrupted (e.g., when the fuel supply to the vehicle engine is interrupted), all or substantially all of the working fluid <b>14</b> traveling along the first flow path <b>38</b> through the vaporizer <b>20</b> and the superheater <b>22</b> is vaporized before entering the turbine <b>24</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0051">From the superheater <b>22</b>, the exhaust <b>44</b> travels through the vehicle exhaust system and is vented to the atmosphere at a reduced temperature, and the working fluid <b>14</b> is directed through the turbine <b>24</b> to generate electrical power. While traveling through the turbine <b>24</b>, the temperature and pressure of the working fluid <b>14</b> are reduced, and, in some embodiments, at least some of the working fluid <b>14</b> condenses into a liquid state. The working fluid <b>14</b> is then directed through a first flow path <b>70</b> of the recuperator <b>16</b> toward the condenser <b>26</b>, where the working fluid <b>14</b> is condensed into a liquid state before being directed through a second flow path <b>72</b> of the recuperator <b>16</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0052">In some embodiments, at least some of the working fluid <b>14</b> can travel directly from the turbine <b>24</b> to the condenser <b>26</b>, bypassing the first flow path <b>70</b> of the recuperator <b>16</b> and at least some of the working fluid <b>14</b> can bypass the second flow path <b>72</b> of the recuperator <b>16</b>. In still other embodiments, the heat recovery system <b>10</b> can operate without a recuperator <b>16</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0053">In embodiments of the heat recovery system <b>10</b> having a recuperator <b>16</b>, such as the illustrated embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, working fluid <b>14</b> traveling through the first flow path <b>70</b> and having an elevated temperature (e.g., between about 160° C. and about 180° C.) transfers heat energy to working fluid <b>14</b> traveling through the second flow path <b>72</b> having a lower temperature (e.g., between about 50° C. and about 60° C.). After the working fluid <b>14</b> is heated in the recuperator <b>16</b>, the working fluid <b>14</b> is returned to the preheater <b>18</b> and recycled through the heat transfer circuit <b>12</b> as described above.</p>
    <p num="p-0054">In some embodiments, the working fluid <b>14</b> can have a pressure of between about 3400 kPa and about 3550 kPa between the preheater <b>18</b> and the turbine <b>24</b>, and the exhaust <b>44</b> can have a pressure of between about 245 kPa and about 285 kPa. In other embodiments, the working fluid <b>14</b> can have other temperatures and pressures than those mentioned above with respect to the illustrated embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, depending upon at least one of the exhaust temperature and pressure, the particular working fluid <b>14</b>, and the configuration (e.g., shape, size, and orientation) of the preheater <b>18</b>, the vaporizer <b>20</b>, and the superheater <b>22</b>. Similarly, the exhaust <b>44</b> can have other temperatures and pressures than those mentioned above with respect to the illustrated embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, depending upon at least one of the chemical breakdown temperature of the working fluid <b>14</b>, the mass flow rate of fuel to the vehicle engine, the type and construction of the vehicle engine, and the configuration (e.g., shape, size, and orientation) of the preheater <b>18</b>, the vaporizer <b>20</b>, and the superheater <b>22</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0055">The configuration (e.g., size, shape, orientation, etc.) of each element of the heat recovery system <b>10</b> (e.g., the preheater <b>18</b>, the vaporizer <b>20</b>, and the superheater <b>22</b>) and the flow paths (e.g., parallel-flow, counter-flow, etc.) extending through each element of the heat recovery system <b>10</b> can be designed to ensure that the temperature of the working fluid <b>14</b> does not rise above the chemical breakdown temperature of the working fluid <b>14</b> and to ensure that hot spots <b>78</b> along the first flow path <b>38</b> do not reach temperatures above the chemical breakdown temperature of the working fluid <b>14</b>. Similarly, the number, shape, size, and orientation of fins and the heat transfer coefficients of each of the elements of the heat recovery system <b>10</b> can be selected to ensure that the temperature of the working fluid <b>14</b> does not reach the chemical breakdown temperature of the working fluid <b>14</b> during operation of the heat recovery system <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0056">In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the heat recovery system <b>10</b> includes a single preheater <b>18</b> positioned along the heat transfer circuit <b>12</b>. However, in some embodiments, the heat recovery system <b>10</b> can include a second preheater <b>18</b> positioned upstream from the vaporizer <b>20</b> along the heat transfer circuit <b>12</b>. In these embodiments, the second preheater <b>18</b> transfers heat energy from the exhaust <b>44</b> to the working fluid <b>14</b> so that exhaust <b>44</b> enters the vaporizer <b>20</b> at a reduced temperature, thereby lowering the wall temperature of the vaporizer <b>20</b>, and helping to ensure that the temperature of the working fluid <b>14</b> traveling through the vaporizer <b>20</b> does not reach the chemical breakdown temperature of the working fluid <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0057">In some such embodiments, the working fluid <b>14</b> exits the second preheater <b>18</b> in a liquid state with little or no vapor, thereby improving fluid flow through the heat transfer circuit <b>12</b> to the vaporizer <b>20</b>.

    <p num="p-0058">In some embodiments, the heat recovery system <b>10</b> can include a controller.

In some embodiments, the valve arrangement can include one or more solenoid-controlled valves.</p>
    <p num="p-0059">In these embodiments, the controller can control the valve arrangement to redirect the working fluid <b>14</b> through the alternate flow path, bypassing the preheater <b>18</b> when the sensor measures a temperature outside of a desired temperature range. In this manner, the controller can direct relatively low temperature working fluid <b>14</b> to the inlet <b>58</b> of the vaporizer <b>20</b> so that the working fluid <b>14</b> entering the vaporizer <b>20</b> is not heated to a temperature above the chemical breakdown temperature of the working fluid <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0060">In other embodiments, the heat recovery system <b>10</b> can have other valve arrangements and other alternate flow paths positioned around the heat transfer circuit to selectively bypass one or more elements of the heat recovery system <b>10</b> or portions of one or more elements of the heat recovery system <b>10</b> in response to changes in the characteristics (e.g., the temperature, pressure, flow rate, etc.) of the exhaust <b>44</b> traveling through the heat recovery system <b>10</b>.</p>
