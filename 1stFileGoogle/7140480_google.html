<heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading> <p num="p-0002">This application is a continuation-in-part of patent applications Ser. No. 09/877,518, filed 7 Jun. 2001 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,705,446 for AUTOMATIC CLUTCH WITH MANUAL OVERRIDE CONTROL MECHANISM by Douglas W. Drussel and George Michael Wilfley, Ser. No. 10/327,160, filed 20 Dec. 2002 for MULTI-ROW CAM-ACTUATED CENTRIFUGAL CLUTCH by Douglas W. Drussel and George Michael Wilfley and assigned to the assignee of this invention, and Ser. No. 10/791,949, filed 2 Mar. 2004 for MANUAL/AUTOMATIC PRESSURE CONTROL MECHANISM FOR CENTRIFUGAL CLUTCH, by Douglas W. Drussel and George Michael Wilfley, and assigned to the assignee of this invention, all incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading>BACKGROUND AND FIELD OF INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">This invention relates to centrifugal clutches and more particularly relates to novel and improved centrifugal clutches having high density cam members which are urged outwardly under centrifugal force in order to activate the clutching elements.</p>
  <p num="p-0004">Centrifugal clutches have been developed for motorcycles utilizing one or two rows of balls or other cam members which would move outwardly in response to rotation of a drive shaft to cause the clutch plates to move into engagement with one another. However, in certain applications it was found that there is insufficient centrifugal force generated to clamp the clutch plates together without substantial slipping or without utilizing a larger size case or cover which exceeds the space allowances within stock engine cases. For example, space is at a particular premium in motorcycle clutches incorporating a manual override mechanism, such as, that set forth and described in copending application for U.S. patent Ser. No. 09/877,518 for AUTOMATIC CLUTCH WITH MANUAL OVERRIDE CONTROL MECHANISM.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">Accordingly, there is a need for a cam mechanism for centrifugal clutches which can generate the necessary force to clamp the clutch plates together without substantial slipping or increase in the size of the clutch case or cover. At the same time it is desirable to provide a cam-actuating mechanism which requires a minimum of manual pressure to engage or disengage the clutch elements with a manual override mechanism while at the same time being highly sensitive to acceleration in speed to effect engagement of the clutch elements. Still further, a controlled amount of slippage may be built into the hub drive for the clutch in order to prevent damage to the drive train resulting from the application of shock loads.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">It has been the practice in motorcycle clutch casings or housings to utilize a generally basket-like housing having circumferentially spaced side walls and to secure the cover by threaded fasteners to the free ends of the side walls and which tends to weaken the connection at the connecting or fastening points between the cover and ends of the side walls, and requires that the cover be mounted on or externally of the housing side walls. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved method of attachment between the cover and side walls but which will distribute the connecting points over a wide area between the cover and side walls, avoid time-consuming attachment of individual fasteners and enable mounting of the cover flush or inset with respect to the housing side walls so as to result in a more compact assembly.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0007">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide for a novel and improved clutch housing and cover assembly specifically adaptable for use in motorcycles.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">It is another object of the present invention to provide for a clutch housing and cover assembly which is compact, able to withstand high pressures and is easy to assemble.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">It is yet another object to provide for a novel and improved cam-actuating mechanism for an automatic clutch which is capable of achieving clutch engagement at lower rpms while generating the necessary clamping force and avoiding slipping of the clutch plates in a simplified, efficient manner.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">It is a further object of the present invention to provide in a centrifugal clutch, including those having internal manual override mechanisms, for an extremely compact cam mechanism which is capable of generating sufficient centrifugal force to clamp the clutch plates together without substantial slipping and within the same size case or cover as employed in stock or standard motorcycles.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">A further object of the present invention is to provide for a novel and improved manual disengagement mechanism to prevent clutch engagement at higher operating speeds as well as to limit the maximum pressure to which the clutch members can be subjected without expanding the size of clutch housing.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">It is a still further object of the present invention to provide for a cover mount assembly in which the cover can be flush or inset mounted with respect to the side walls of the housing in a novel and highly efficient manner.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">An additional object of the present invention is to provide in an automatic clutch for controlled slippage to prevent shock loads from being imparted through the drive train of a motorcycle.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">In accordance with the present invention, a centrifugal clutch has a plurality of cam members interposed between a cover and pressure plate wherein the cam members are movable outwardly under centrifugal force to cause the pressure plate to move in a direction forcing the clutch members into clutching engagement, and in certain applications a manual override mechanism is utilized to lock out the pressure plate to maintain the clutch members in a disengaged position notwithstanding the speed of rotation of the clutch; and when a manual override mechanism is not employed or, if employed, it is not in the lockout position, pressure limiting means between the cover and pressure plate are operative to prevent shock loads from being imparted to the clutch members when the clutch members are advanced into clutching engagement with one another.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">In motorcycle applications where space is at a premium, another feature is to employ a cover which can be mounted either flush or inset with respect to circumferentially spaced side walls of a basket-type housing and be securely anchored by a retaining ring inserted into aligned, circumferentially extending slots along the inner surfaces of the side walls thereby resulting in a compact, high strength assembly.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">There has been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are, of course, additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ONE FORM OF INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0039">Referring to the drawings, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates the mounting of one form of automatic clutch <b>10</b> in the drive train of an off-road motorcycle wherein a crankshaft set <b>12</b> from an engine piston <b>14</b> imparts rotation to a power input side of the clutch <b>10</b> through a pinion <b>16</b> into a primary drive gear <b>18</b> at one end of a clutch housing or basket <b>17</b>. A transmission shaft <b>20</b> is mounted for rotation by the clutch <b>10</b> when in the engaged position and, through speed reduction gears represented at <b>22</b> rotates a drive sprocket <b>24</b> of a belt or chain drive, not shown, into the rear wheel of the motorcycle. In a manner shown and described in more detail in copending application for patent Ser. No. 09/277,518, a push rod <b>26</b> extends through the transmission shaft <b>20</b> and is manually controlled by a hand lever, not shown, on the motorcycle to advance a slide member <b>27</b> forwardly and force a series of balls <b>28</b> in a radial outward direction against a pressure plate <b>30</b>. Outward radial movement of the balls <b>28</b> against the pressure plate <b>30</b> will displace the pressure plate <b>30</b> away from the cover <b>25</b> and force a series of radially inner clutch plates <b>32</b> to move into positive engagement with radially outer clutch plates <b>34</b>. Again, although not shown, a linkage at the end of the push rod opposite to the cover <b>25</b> is connected to a cable control wire which can be manually controlled by a hand lever on the handlebar of the motorcycle to advance and retract the push rod <b>26</b> with respect to the clutch assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0040">The automatic clutch <b>10</b> also incorporates a novel cam-actuating mechanism generally designated at <b>36</b> and comprising multiple staggered rows of cam members <b>38</b>, <b>39</b> and <b>40</b>, to be hereinafter described in reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 11</figref>, which will move outwardly under centrifugal force between the cover <b>25</b> and pressure plate <b>30</b> to force the clutch plates <b>34</b> into positive engagement with the plates <b>32</b>. The inner clutch plates <b>32</b> have tabs <b>33</b> which are axially slidable in grooves in the outer wall of hub <b>43</b>, and the transmission shaft <b>20</b> is mounted for rotation of the hub <b>43</b>. The radially outer clutch plates <b>34</b> have extension tabs <b>35</b> which are slidable axially along circumferentially spaced axial grooves on the inner wall of a cylindrical basket or housing <b>17</b>. A basket <b>17</b> is secured along its outer peripheral edge to the outer peripheral edge of the cover <b>25</b> by suitable fasteners, such as, screws <b>45</b>. The clutch plates <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> are sandwiched between the pressure plate <b>30</b> and the gear <b>18</b> at the end of the basket <b>17</b>, and the pressure plate <b>30</b> is normally held away from the clutch plates <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> by a series of compression springs <b>59</b> mounted on bolts <b>58</b> between the cover <b>25</b> and recessed portions <b>57</b> in the pressure plate <b>30</b>. The spring tension of the springs <b>59</b> is regulated to resist radial outward movement of the balls <b>38</b>, <b>39</b> and <b>40</b> as well as movement of the pressure plate <b>30</b> against the plates <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> until the clutch <b>10</b> reaches a predetermined rotational speed imparted by the crankshaft <b>12</b> through the gear <b>18</b>, for example, when the engine has been started by the kickstart lever L. The construction and arrangement of the clutch plates <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> as well as the kickstart lever L is standard.</p>
  <heading>Detailed Description of Second Form of Invention</heading> <p num="p-0041"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 11</figref> illustrate another form of clutch <b>10</b>′ in which like parts to those of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are correspondingly enumerated. More specifically, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the manual override mechanism in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> consisting of the push rod <b>26</b>, slide <b>27</b> and cams <b>28</b> has been removed. Instead, the clutch is actuated only by the cam-actuating mechanism <b>36</b> which is broadly comprised of radially inner and outer rows of circumferentially spaced cam members or balls <b>38</b>, <b>39</b> and <b>40</b> interposed between a pressure plate <b>30</b> and a cover <b>25</b>. The balls <b>38</b> to <b>40</b> are responsive to centrifugal force to roll outwardly along radial pockets or cam faces <b>48</b>, <b>52</b> and <b>56</b> in the pressure plate <b>30</b> and aligned pockets or cam faces <b>46</b>, <b>50</b> and <b>54</b> in the cover <b>25</b> so as to axially displace the outer frictional clutch plates <b>32</b> into locking engagement with the inner clutch plates <b>34</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0042">An important feature of the present invention resides in the radially inner and outer rows of cam members or balls <b>38</b>, <b>39</b> and <b>40</b>. Preferably, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 11</figref>, a series of circumferentially spaced cam faces <b>46</b> are arranged in a radially outer row of the cover <b>25</b> and are disposed in facing relation to a corresponding row of cam faces <b>48</b> on the pressure plate <b>30</b>. The balls <b>40</b> are disposed between each of the confronting cam faces <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> and are disposed in uniformly spaced relation to one another.</p>
  <p num="p-0043">An inner row of cam faces <b>50</b> is arranged on the cover <b>25</b> in inner concentric relation to the outer row between alternate adjacent pairs of cam faces <b>46</b> in the outer row. The cam faces <b>50</b> are disposed in aligned, facing relation to correspondingly spaced cam faces <b>52</b> on the pressure plate <b>30</b>, and the balls <b>39</b> are disposed for radial sliding movement between the cam faces <b>50</b> and <b>52</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0044">A third row of cam faces <b>54</b> extends between alternate cam faces <b>50</b> on the cover <b>25</b> and are disposed radially inwardly but partially between alternate adjacent pairs of the cam faces <b>46</b>. The cam faces <b>54</b> are disposed in aligned facing relation to correspondingly sized cam faces <b>56</b> in the pressure plate <b>30</b> and are adapted to receive the ball members <b>38</b>. The cam faces <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> define a somewhat staggered concentric row with respect to the inner concentric row of cam faces <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> by virtue of being somewhat smaller in size to receive the smaller balls <b>38</b>. Accordingly, the cam faces <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> are free to extend radially outwardly between the cam faces <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> a slightly greater distance than the larger cam faces <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0045">Preferably, each of the outer cam faces <b>46</b> is formed along an angled surface <b>44</b> of approximately 30° to 50° adjacent to the outer periphery of the cover <b>25</b> and are of generally concave, oval-shaped configuration so as to be elongated in the radial direction. The cam faces <b>46</b> are dimensioned to be of a length to permit rolling movement of a ball between the radial inner and outer positions illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> in response to centrifugal force. The same balls <b>40</b> are free to slide or roll in an outward radial direction along the outer concentric, confronting cam faces <b>48</b> in the pressure plate <b>30</b>; however, the cam faces <b>48</b> are shallower than the cam faces <b>46</b> and flatten out from an inner radial curved configuration along the rolling surface portion of the face. The cam faces <b>48</b> each terminate in the flattened surface portions so as to be relatively open-ended as best seen from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> at the outer peripheral edge of the cover <b>30</b>. The inner row of cam faces <b>50</b> is situated at the base <b>51</b> of the angled portion <b>44</b> and each face <b>50</b> is of generally concave, oval-shaped configuration and elongated in the radial direction with the contact surfaces of the cam faces <b>50</b> angled at approximately 30°–50° toward the pressure plate <b>30</b>. The balls <b>39</b> are free to undergo the same distance of radial sliding or rolling movement as the balls <b>40</b>. In turn, the cam faces <b>52</b> on the pressure plate <b>30</b> are of generally concave configuration and elongated in the radial direction but not angled toward the confronting cam faces <b>50</b> and have flat surfaces along which the balls <b>39</b> are free to roll.</p>
  <p num="p-0046">The intermediate or staggered cam faces <b>54</b> on the cover <b>25</b> are of a configuration corresponding to the inner row <b>50</b> but again are shorter only to accommodate the smaller balls <b>38</b>. Similarly, the cam faces <b>56</b> in the pressure plate <b>30</b> correspond in configuration to the cam faces <b>52</b> but are shallower than the cam faces <b>52</b>. Referring to the cam-actuating mechanism <b>36</b> employed in the preferred and alternate forms of invention of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 15</figref>, the staggered inner row of balls <b>38</b> maximizes the weight of the balls so that axial force generated is maximized at minimum speeds. This creates more axial force at lower speeds to engage the clutch positively at low engine speed. The outer row of balls <b>40</b> has the most influence because it is at the largest diameter so that it is fitted with the most balls possible. To get more weight an inner row is added. To maximize the diameter and therefore the centrifugal effect of the inner row, it is nested between the outer row of balls. This means that the inner row must have the same number of balls as the outer row. For the purpose of illustration but not limitation, if there are thirty-six balls <b>40</b> of ⅜″ diameter in the outer row, the inner row can be made up of thirty-six smaller balls or a combination of small and large balls. It turns out that eighteen balls of ⅜″ diameter and eighteen balls of 5/16″ diameter will fit in the inner row and nest between the balls in the outer row and provide the maximum mass. The other options such as all 5/16″ diameter balls in the inner row or limiting each row to thirty-two balls and use all ⅜″ diameter balls all result in less total mass. The cam faces for the balls <b>38</b>, <b>39</b> and <b>40</b> are designed to let the balls ride on a radially flat surface on the pressure plate and on a radially uniformly inclined surface on the cover. The pockets for the ⅜″ balls and 5/16″ balls are different depths so all the balls will be in contact with both the pressure plate and cover at all times.</p>
  <p num="p-0047">The relative depths within each component is of no significance. Thus they are all designed to travel the same distance. The cam faces are actually slightly longer than necessary so the balls will never come to the outer ends, but will always be stopped by the axial resistance of the friction disks. The pockets are different lengths only because of the diameter of the cutter used to make them. The straight portion of each pocket (the range where the ball is intended to operate) is the same for all cam faces or pockets since the travel is expected to be the same. The cutter makes a radius beyond this usable length which is equal to the cutter radius so each pocket is the usable length plus twice the radius. Thus the pockets for ⅜″ balls are 1/16″ longer than the pockets for the 5/16″ balls. The shape of the outer end of the pockets doesn't matter, as the balls never get there anyway. The inner end of each pocket is normally rounded so the ball will nest there when the clutch is disengaged, but it could be squared or other shapes to provide a method to simply keep the balls from falling out. In practice, the shapes of the ends of the pockets may vary because of the overall shape of the part and how they blend with other geometry.</p>
  <p num="p-0048">Further, in certain applications, it may be desirable to employ a modified form of pressure plate <b>30</b>′ in place of the pressure plate <b>30</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>. The pressure plate <b>30</b>′ has substantially flat surfaces <b>48</b>′, <b>50</b>′ and <b>52</b>′ along which the balls <b>38</b>, <b>39</b> and <b>40</b>, respectively, will advance. In this way, the complementary cam faces <b>46</b>, <b>50</b> and <b>54</b> on the cover <b>25</b> serve as the sole means of spacing and guiding the ball members <b>38</b>, <b>39</b> and <b>40</b> radially inwardly and outwardly between the cover <b>25</b> and pressure plate <b>30</b>′. It will be readily apparent that other types of ball races may be employed in place of the pockets or cam faces <b>46</b>, <b>50</b> and <b>54</b> in the pressure plate to maintain the desired spacing and alignment of the balls <b>38</b> to <b>40</b> between the confronting surfaces of the cover <b>25</b> and the pressure plate <b>30</b> or <b>30</b>′.</p>
  <p num="p-0049">Preferably, the cam members or balls <b>38</b> to <b>40</b> are composed of a material of high density, such as, tungsten carbide in cooperation with the cam rows as described. In this way, it is possible to make the entire cam-actuating mechanism more compact with smaller-sized balls of higher density being more sensitive to the speed of rotation or centrifugal force so as to displace the clutch plates into positive locking engagement at lower speeds. Use of high density cam members <b>38</b> to <b>40</b> therefore minimizes the speed necessary to cause the balls to advance the plates into locking engagement as well as to prevent, or at least minimize, any slippage between the clutch plates <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0050">Referring in particular to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the pressure plate <b>30</b> is normally retained against the cover <b>25</b> by a series of compression springs <b>59</b>′ mounted on bolts <b>58</b> between the cover <b>25</b> and recessed portions <b>57</b> in the pressure plate <b>30</b>. Preferably, the springs <b>59</b>′ are WAVE™ springs Model No. CO75-M5 manufactured and sold by Smalley Steel Ring Co. of Lake Zurich, Ill. The springs <b>59</b>′ are pretensioned to resist outward radial movement of the balls <b>38</b> to <b>40</b> until the engine reaches a predetermined speed thereby causing the clutch plates <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> to move into locking engagement and impart rotation to the hub <b>60</b> and shaft <b>20</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0051">In certain applications, such as, for example, trail bikes or racing bikes where a limited degree of slippage is needed to absorb shock loads resulting from sudden braking, one or more adjustments may be made including but not limited to reducing the number of balls <b>38</b> to <b>40</b> in each row, reducing the spring tension of the springs <b>59</b>′, or employing lower density ball members in one or more of the rows <b>38</b> to <b>40</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">In accordance with the present invention, another highly effective way to prevent shock loads from being transmitted through the drive train when there is non-slip engagement between the clutch plates <b>32</b> to <b>34</b> is to employ a torque limiter mechanism T as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>12</b> to <b>15</b>. Thus, in place of the inner hub drive shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, split inner hub portion <b>60</b> and outer hub portion <b>61</b> as well as a spacer <b>62</b> are positioned in the basket <b>17</b>; also a thrust washer <b>63</b> is mounted on the shaft <b>20</b> to separate the end wall of the basket <b>17</b> from the inner hub <b>60</b>. A circular flange <b>65</b> on the outer hub portion <b>61</b> is sandwiched between a pair of annular friction disks <b>66</b> and a cover plate <b>68</b>. A Belleville spring <b>69</b> and retainer <b>70</b> are assembled together with the inner hub <b>60</b> by a series of screws <b>72</b> having suitable shims <b>74</b> between the enlarged heads of the screws <b>72</b> and spring retainer <b>70</b>, the Belleville spring <b>69</b> acting to pretension the shims <b>74</b> and thereby to compress the friction disks <b>66</b> into substantially non-slipping engagement with the flange <b>65</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0053">When the pressure plate <b>30</b> is displaced by the balls <b>38</b> to <b>40</b> to lock the clutch plates <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> together, the outer hub <b>61</b> will operate through the friction disks <b>66</b> to drive the inner hub <b>60</b> and transmission shaft <b>20</b>. The friction disks <b>66</b> will permit slight or instantaneous slippage so as to absorb any shock loading, for example, when the rear wheel of the motorcycle is off the ground and spinning, then suddenly hits the ground and is stopped while the engine continues to run. Thus, there is just enough slippage between the friction disks <b>66</b> and flange <b>65</b> to prevent shock loads from being imparted to the drive train via transmission shaft <b>20</b> as a result of the non-slip engagement between the clutch plates <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">In addition, bearing races <b>64</b> are interposed between the spacer <b>62</b> and the inner hub <b>60</b> to receive a plurality of circumferentially spaced needle bearings <b>75</b> to prevent the thrust washer <b>63</b> from galling or seizing up under certain conditions of use if there is insufficient lubrication between the thrust washer <b>63</b> and spacer <b>62</b> when the inner hub <b>60</b> is driven by the hub drive <b>61</b>. The needle bearings <b>75</b> also reduce the friction between the spacer <b>62</b> and the inner hub <b>60</b> when the clutch is not engaged; and reduces any tendency of the clutch to creep when it is not engaged.</p>
  <p num="p-0055"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 to 14</figref> illustrate a motorcycle clutch <b>10</b>′ having a manual override mechanism including a control rod <b>77</b> with hand control lever <b>78</b>, receiver or guide <b>79</b> and ball bearing <b>80</b>. Like parts to those of the preferred form of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 11</figref> are correspondingly enumerated. Specifically, this form of invention is an improvement to the modified form of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> in our copending application for patent Ser. No. 09/877,518. The pressure plate <b>30</b> and cover <b>25</b> are designed to enable the manual override mechanism to mechanically lock the clutch in a released or neutral position, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, so that the clutch <b>10</b>″ cannot be engaged until the control rod <b>77</b> is released by releasing the lever <b>78</b> to the position shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. To this end, the receiver <b>79</b> includes a sleeve <b>85</b> inserted in the leading end of the transmission shaft <b>20</b> and an opposed generally cup-shaped end <b>82</b>. An external shoulder <b>84</b> on the end <b>82</b> engages a flat end of the bearing race for the ball bearing <b>80</b>, the bearing <b>80</b> being permanently affixed to an inner peripheral edge <b>90</b> of the pressure plate <b>30</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">A threaded stem <b>86</b> is adjustably mounted in a threaded bore centrally of the receiver <b>79</b> and has a ball bearing <b>88</b> at one end of the stem <b>86</b> within the sleeve <b>85</b>. The stem is threadedly adjustable and locked in place by a lock nut <b>92</b>, according to the length of the control rod <b>77</b>, so that the receiver <b>79</b> will be advanced between the released position shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> and lockout position shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Accordingly, only when the control lever <b>78</b> is released, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, will the pressure plate <b>30</b> be able to compress the clutch plates <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> under the urging of the ball members <b>38</b> to <b>40</b> in response to the engine accelerating to a speed sufficient to overcome the force of the springs <b>59</b>′, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. In this way, the automatic clutch <b>10</b>″ can be employed on a motorcycle having an electric starter in place of a stock or manual clutch typically used in such situations. In the same manner as in the form of invention of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 11</figref>, the modified form of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 to 14</figref> employs the same cam-actuating mechanism <b>36</b> so as to be extremely compact with smaller cam members or balls <b>38</b>, <b>39</b> and <b>40</b> being highly sensitive to acceleration in speeds and thus the speed necessary to cause the clutch plates <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> to engage. In addition, minimum manual or hand pressure is required on the hand lever <b>78</b> to retain the clutch plates <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> in the released position.</p>
  <p num="p-0057">The foregoing description of the modified form of clutch <b>10</b>″ shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 to 14</figref> is given more by way of illustrating the versatility of the forms of automatic clutches described with or without the manual override mechanisms <b>36</b> of the type disclosed herein as well as in my hereinbefore referred to copending application for patent Ser. No. 09/877,518. In general, however, the manual override mechanism <b>36</b> is useful in any application where it is desirable to manually release or engage the clutch members <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> in addition to the automatic clutch, and the pressure required to engage the clutch members can be adjusted by a combination of changes in spring tension of the springs <b>59</b>′ as well as the number and weight of cam members <b>38</b> to <b>40</b>. Thus, the cam-actuating mechanism for the reasons described requires a minimum of manual pressure to engage or disengage the clutch elements with a manual override mechanism as well as being highly sensitive to acceleration in speed to cause the clutch members to engage.</p>
  <p num="p-0058">In use, both with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 12</figref> to <b>14</b>, the control rod <b>26</b> or <b>77</b>, respectively, can be manually adjusted to control the degree or amount of pressure between the clutch plates and thus can effectively regulate slipping engagement between the fully engaged and disengaged positions of the clutch plates. For example, when the clutch is at a speed sufficient to cause the clutch plates <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> to move into engagement with one another, manually advancing the control rod <b>20</b> or <b>77</b> to cause the pressure plate to start to move away from the clutch plates initially will lessen the pressure between the clutch plates. As the pressure on the control rod <b>20</b> or <b>77</b> is increased, it will further lessen the pressure or clamping force between the clutch plates until finally the clutch plates will become disengaged. In this way, the operator is able to control the degree of slipping engagement between the clutch plates through the hand control lever independently of any spring pressure, for example, exerted by the compression springs <b>59</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or the torque limiter T of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 to 14</figref> and offers another dimension to the operator in exerting close control over the speed and performance of the motorcycle.</p>
  <heading>Detailed Description of Third Form of Invention</heading> <p num="p-0059"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 to 21</figref> illustrate a third form of invention for a motorcycle clutch <b>101</b> and having a manual override mechanism <b>100</b> comprised of a control rod <b>102</b> with hand control lever <b>103</b>, cable C and a stem <b>104</b>. The stem is threadedly adjustable and locked in place by a lock nut <b>106</b>, according to the length of the control rod <b>102</b>, so that the receiver <b>104</b> can be axially advanced into a lockout position, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, in response to actuation of the control lever <b>103</b>. Specifically, in the lockout position, the stem <b>104</b> will act through the mounting plate <b>110</b> which is anchored by a snap ring <b>112</b> to the pressure plate <b>114</b> to prevent or lock out the clutch plates <b>32</b> from engagement with the clutch plates <b>33</b>. In this respect, the pressure plate <b>114</b> is biased away from the clutch plates <b>32</b> and <b>33</b> by compression springs <b>136</b>. When the clutch is accelerated up to a predetermined operating speed, a series of inner and outer rows of cam members or balls <b>38</b>, <b>39</b> are urged outwardly under centrifugal force to overcome the urging of the springs <b>120</b> and drive the pressure plate <b>114</b> into engagement with the endmost plate <b>32</b>′ as well as the other plates <b>32</b> which are mounted on the inner wall of a clutch housing <b>126</b>, unless the control rod <b>102</b> has been advanced to the lockout position as described.</p>
  <p num="p-0060">In the same manner as in the form of invention of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 11</figref>, the form of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 to 16</figref> is extremely compact with smaller cam members or balls <b>38</b>, <b>39</b> which advance along the cam faces between the pressure plate <b>114</b> and cover <b>116</b> as hereinbefore described. As a result, minimum manual pressure is required on the hand lever <b>103</b> to retain the clutch plates <b>32</b> and <b>33</b> in the disengaged position notwithstanding higher speeds of rotation which would normally cause the cam members to advance outwardly and shift the pressure plate <b>114</b> to cause the clutch plates <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> to move into the engaged position.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">The control rod <b>102</b> extends through a transmission shaft <b>20</b> mounted in an inner hub <b>122</b> which is journaled by ball bearings <b>123</b> with respect to a lower end wall <b>124</b> of the housing <b>126</b>. An important feature of the form of invention illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 to 21</figref> resides in the mounting of the cover <b>116</b> with respect to side walls <b>128</b> of the housing <b>126</b>. As best seen from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the housing <b>126</b> is generally basket-shaped having arcuate side walls or fingers <b>128</b> at equally spaced circumferential intervals which taper away from the base <b>124</b> into relatively thick free end portions <b>130</b>. The free end portions <b>130</b> are provided with arcuate, circumferentially extending slots or grooves <b>132</b> which are aligned with one another for insertion of an endless snap ring <b>134</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 to 20</figref>, which extends around the inner wall surfaces of the housing walls <b>128</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0062">In turn, the cover <b>116</b> is provided with cam faces in facing relation to the cam faces on the confronting surface of the pressure plate <b>114</b>, and the pressure plate <b>114</b> is normally held away from the clutch plates <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> by a series of compression springs <b>136</b> mounted on tubular posts <b>137</b> through which threaded fasteners <b>138</b> extend between the cover <b>116</b> and pressure plate <b>114</b>. The spring tension of the springs <b>136</b> is regulated to resist radial outward movement of the balls as well as movement of the pressure plate <b>114</b> against the clutch plates <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> until the clutch <b>100</b> reaches a predetermined rotational speed. Typically, a starter gear <b>140</b> on the housing <b>126</b> receives input power from a starter, not shown, to rotate the housing <b>126</b> and drive sprocket <b>142</b> which in turn rotates the crankshaft to start the engine.</p>
  <p num="p-0063">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 14</figref>, it has been customary in the past to utilize threaded fasteners <b>45</b> to extend through aligned bores in the outer peripheral edge of the cover <b>25</b> and the spaced housing walls of the housing or basket <b>17</b>. In accordance with this form of invention, it is proposed to greatly strengthen and simplify the interconnection between the cover <b>116</b> and housing <b>126</b> by forming the cover <b>116</b> with circumferentially spaced, radially outward flat projections or ears <b>144</b> which are complementary to the spaced walls <b>128</b>. Thus, the intervening flat surface portions <b>146</b> between the radial projections <b>144</b> are dimensioned to axially advance along the inner arcuate surfaces of the free ends <b>130</b> of the housing to a point directly inside of the slots <b>132</b> for the snap ring <b>134</b> when the clutch housing is at rest. The snap ring <b>134</b> is then inserted into the aligned slots <b>132</b> and will bear firmly against the outer flat wall surfaces <b>145</b> and <b>146</b> of the cover <b>116</b>. In this relation, the snap ring <b>134</b> will apply uniform resistance to any forces applied to the cover either by the override mechanism <b>100</b> or the balls <b>38</b>, <b>39</b> when expanded under centrifugal force.</p>
  <p num="p-0064">One form of snap ring is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 to 20</figref> and is manufactured and sold by Smalley Steel Ring Co. of Lake Zurich, Ill. The spring <b>134</b> is comprised of three layers or plies including upper and lower layers A and B with an intermediate layer C sandwiched therebetween. Layers A and B have oppositely directed tapered ends D and E which are superimposed upon a common angled portion F of the intermediate ply C so as to result in a snap ring of uniform thickness and strength virtually throughout. It will be apparent, however, that other snap rings or retaining rings may be employed including those of a single thickness having split ends which will permit radial contraction in order to slide, for example, along the inner surfaces of the free ends <b>130</b> into alignment with the slots <b>139</b> whereupon releasing the snap ring <b>134</b> it will expand or spring into the slots <b>132</b>.</p>
  <heading>Detailed Description of Fourth Form of Invention</heading> <p num="p-0065">There is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> a clutch <b>200</b> corresponding to the motorcycle clutch <b>101</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 to 21</figref> and accordingly like parts to those of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 to 21</figref> are correspondingly enumerated. A cam-actuating mechanism <b>228</b> is mounted between a pressure plate <b>230</b> and cover <b>232</b>. The cover <b>232</b> comprises an annular stationary wall portion <b>234</b> having an outer peripheral edge <b>235</b> affixed to the housing <b>128</b> by snap ring <b>134</b> in the same manner as described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 to 21</figref> and specifically in such a way that the annular wall portion <b>234</b> is substantially flush with the free end <b>130</b> of the housing walls <b>128</b>. In addition, the cover <b>232</b> includes an inner movable portion <b>238</b> and outer relatively thin retainer portion <b>240</b> which extends directly behind the annular cover portion <b>234</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0066">The cam-actuating mechanism <b>228</b> is comprised of radially inner and outer rows of circumferentially spaced cam members <b>242</b> and <b>244</b> interposed between the pressure plate <b>230</b> and retainer portion <b>240</b> and is modified from that of the form of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 to 21</figref> by utilizing only one row of cam faces in inner concentric relation to the outer rows of cam faces in the pressure plate <b>230</b> and cover portion <b>240</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0067">A plurality of circumferentially spaced counterbores <b>254</b> are aligned with bores <b>256</b> in the cover portion <b>238</b> for insertion of threaded fasteners <b>258</b> between the cover portions <b>238</b> and <b>232</b> while leaving a clearance <b>260</b> between the cover portions. Thus, the cover portion <b>238</b> is axially displaceable with respect to the fasteners <b>258</b> to move through the clearance space <b>260</b> in response to increased. spreading forces applied by the cams <b>242</b> and <b>244</b> after the clutch plates <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> have moved into clutching engagement.</p>
  <p num="p-0068">A second series of circumferentially spaced bores <b>262</b> are formed in the cover portion <b>240</b> and receive tubular posts <b>263</b> extending from the pressure plate <b>230</b> for insertion of threaded fasteners <b>264</b>. A washer <b>265</b> is positioned at one end of each post <b>263</b> to receive a bolt <b>264</b>. An annular shoulder <b>268</b> on each bore <b>262</b> is in opposed facing relation to shoulder <b>265</b> so that the shoulders <b>265</b> and <b>268</b> define end stops for a spring <b>270</b> mounted under compression therebetween. The springs <b>270</b> preload the balls <b>242</b>, <b>244</b> under a predetermined amount of force to resist outward radial movement of the balls <b>242</b>, <b>244</b> until the engine reaches a predetermined speed to impart sufficient centrifugal force to the balls for outward advancement along their respective cam faces. The springs <b>270</b> can be adjusted by shims as well as inward threading of each bolt <b>264</b> to vary the distance between the shoulders <b>265</b> and <b>268</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0069">A series of spring pairs <b>272</b> and <b>272</b>A are mounted around the cover portion in aligned bores or spring seats <b>275</b> in the cover portions <b>234</b> and <b>240</b>. The springs <b>272</b>, <b>272</b>A are compressed as the pressure plate <b>230</b> and cover portion <b>234</b> are expanded to move the clutch plates <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> into engagement.</p>
  <p num="p-0070">The spring force of the springs <b>272</b>, <b>272</b>A is such as to resist spreading of the pressure plate <b>230</b> and cover portion <b>240</b> beyond a predetermined limit which is the maximum clamping force that can be safely exerted on the clutch plates <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> to assure non-slipping engagement but will permit the plates <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> to slip in the event that extreme shock loads are transmitted through the drive train.</p>
  <p num="p-0071">In order to override the automatic clutch, the push rod <b>102</b> is operated by the override mechanism <b>100</b> and the leading end of the push rod is aligned with the threadedly adjustable stem <b>104</b>. When the push rod <b>102</b> is advanced by the control lever <b>103</b>, it will be operative through the mounting plate <b>110</b> to cause the entire cam-actuating mechanism to be displaced away from the clutch plates <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, and at low speeds will cause the pressure plate <b>230</b> to be held away from the clutch plates <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>. At higher speeds, the push rod <b>102</b> can be engaged to release the clutch by moving the entire cam-actuating mechanism as an assembly away from the clutch plates <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> by compressing the outer maximum pressure springs <b>272</b>, <b>272</b>A. This will of course exert even greater force on the cover <b>234</b> at its points of attachment to the free ends <b>130</b> of the housing walls <b>128</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0072">In the same manner as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 to 21</figref>, the cover portion <b>234</b> has radially outwardly projecting ears <b>235</b> which are complementary to the spaced walls <b>128</b> of the housing and is dimensioned to fit snugly inside of the side walls <b>128</b> at a position beneath the slots <b>132</b>. The snap ring <b>134</b> is inserted into the aligned slots <b>132</b> to fit snugly against the outer flat wall surfaces of the cover so that the outer or exterior wall surface of the cover is substantially flush with the free ends <b>130</b> of the housing side walls.</p>
  <p num="p-0073">In operation, the control rod <b>102</b> is operative in the same manner as described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 12</figref> to <b>14</b> to regulate slippage between the clutch plates. An advantage in the form of invention shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is that the manual force required for the control rod <b>102</b> to disengage the clutch plates <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> is reduced since the mounting plate <b>110</b> on the stem <b>104</b> will displace the entire cam-actuating mechanism away from the clutch plates <b>32</b> and <b>33</b>, as opposed to manually squeezing the pressure plate to force the balls or cam members <b>38</b>, <b>39</b> radially inwardly to relieve or release the pressure on the clutch plates <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>. It is therefore much easier for the operator to cause the clutch plates to slip as well as to disengage.</p>
  <p num="p-0074">Although the forms of invention herein have been described for use in motorcycles, it will be appreciated that they are adaptable for use in other applications in which an automatic clutch is utilized, such as for example, drag racing, cars, trucks, tractors, go-carts, all-terrain vehicles, cement mixers and power tools that, depending upon the application, the different features of the forms of invention herein described may be utilized with a single row cam-actuating mechanism.</p>
  <p num="p-0075">It is therefore to be understood that while preferred and modified forms of invention are herein set forth and described, the above and other modifications and changes may be made in the construction and arrangement of elements as well as intended use of the apparatus without departing from the spirit and scope thereof as defined by the appended claims and equivalents thereof.</p>
