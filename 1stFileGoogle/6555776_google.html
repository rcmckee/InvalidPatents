    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention relates generally to postal mail conveying or transporting systems, and more particularly to a new and improved postal mail transporting, handling, and sorting system wherein originally random pieces of mail can be conveyed, sorted, and placed into a desirable delivery-walk or serial address sequence as a result of being conveyed or processed by means of only a single pass through the system.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>In connection with conventional mail delivery systems, two types of mail units generally comprise the vast majority of mail pieces or articles to be delivered, namely, letter mail, and what is known in the industry as flat mail or flats, which, more particularly, comprise, for example, magazines, newspapers, large envelopes, and the like. In order to optimally control, or even more desirably, reduce, operational or systemic costs, world-class postal services require, and are therefore seeking, a low-cost, high-throughput, automated system for sorting their daily mail, which is to be delivered, in accordance with what is known as a delivery-walk sequence format, or more simply, in accordance with a delivery-sequence format. In accordance with the general or overall concept of such a sequence format system, all destination-addressed mail pieces, originally disposed in a random manner at a particular postal collection, accumulation or repository location or facility, and which, taken as a whole, therefore inherently comprise, define, or have, in effect, a random array of delivery addresses printed thereon, would be processed and sorted in accordance with a desirable order or sequence. More particularly, in accordance with such a desirable sequence or order, all original, randomly-arranged destination-addressed mail pieces would be sorted or arranged in a particular or specific predetermined order which would correspond with the order of destination addresses to which the postal mail carrier would make his or her mail deliveries along his or her delivery route on a daily basis.</p>
    <p>Various letters and flats systems, somewhat similar to the aforenoted desirable system, have been developed in the past in an attempt to attain the desired systemic objectives, however, for various reasons, such conventional systems have not been completely satisfactory or viable, and therefore, such systems have not been commercially successful. For example, the United States Postal Service (USPS) has developed several different systems, such as, for example, a Carrier Sequence Bar Code Sorter (CSBCS) System, or a Delivery Bar Code Sorter (DBCS) System, however, such systems are only capable of sorting and processing letter mail. While substantially one hundred percent (100%) of letter mail is currently provided with, for example, address bar codes in order to facilitate the implementation and operation of an automatic delivery sequence sorting system, currently, substantially all flat mail must still be manually sorted for integrated inclusion within a delivery sequence system. Obviously, additional economic benefits would be derived or achieved if an automatic delivery sequence sorting system was capable of implementing the processing or sorting of both letter mail and flat mail pieces, articles, units, or the like from an original random letter/flat mixed mail input.</p>
    <p>Continuing further, an additional operational impediment of current automatic delivery sequence sorting systems with respect to their widespread usage and acceptance for sorting and processing various mail pieces, articles, units, or the like, resides in the fact that in order to ultimately arrange the original randomly-arranged destination-addressed mail pieces into the specifically desired delivery or serial address sequence or order, such conventional systems require that the randomly arranged destination-addressed mail pieces be conveyed through, or processed within, the systems a multiple number of times, that is, in accordance with terminology well-known in the art, the mail pieces must navigate multiple passes through the system. As a result of undergoing multiple-pass conveyance through the system, the mail pieces are pre-sorted into relatively large groups of mail pieces, the large groups of pre-sorted mail pieces are again subsequently sorted and processed through the system so as to further sort such mail pieces into relatively smaller groups, and the overall process is continued until predeterminedly sized manageable groups of mail are able to be effectively integrated into delivery-sequence collections or arrangements of the mail pieces to be delivered. It can therefore be appreciated that not only do such systems require a substantial period of time to fully sort and process a predetermined number of mail pieces, but in addition, the multi-pass conveyance or handling of the mail pieces through the system unfortunately provides additional opportunities for handling or sorting errors. Still yet further, and particularly in connection with the processing or sorting of flat mail pieces, flat mail pieces or articles are easily physically degraded when they are extensively handled. Consequently, the multiple passes of such flat mail pieces through conventional automated systems leads to the physical deterioration of flat mail articles which, again, renders such systems incapable of viably handling, sorting, and processing flat mail articles.</p>
    <p>A need therefore exists in the art for a new and improved automatic postal mail transporting, handling, and sorting system which can viably handle both letter mail and flat mail, and wherein further, originally random pieces of both types of mail, presented or delivered into the system in a random letter/flat mixed input, can be conveyed, sorted, and placed into a desirable delivery-walk or serial address sequence as a result of being conveyed or processed by means of only a single pass through the system. In this manner, flat mail pieces will not be unduly degraded, and opportunities for mishandling of the mail pieces are limited.</p>
    <heading>OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved automatic postal mail transporting, handling, and sorting system which can viably handle both letter mail and flat mail.</p>
    <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved automatic postal mail transporting, handling, and sorting system which can viably handle both letter mail and flat mail and which effectively overcomes the various operational disadvantages and drawbacks characteristic of conventional PRIOR ART mail handling and sorting systems.</p>
    <p>An additional object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved automatic postal mail transporting, handling, and sorting system wherein the system can viably handle both letter mail and flat mail, wherein the system can effectively overcome the various operational disadvantages and drawbacks characteristic of conventional PRIOR ART mail handling and sorting systems, and wherein originally random pieces of both types of mail, presented or delivered into the system in a random letter/flat mixed input, can be conveyed, sorted, and placed into a desirable delivery-walk or serial address sequence.</p>
    <p>A further object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved automatic postal mail transporting, handling, and sorting system wherein the system can viably handle both letter mail and flat mail, wherein the system can effectively overcome the various operational disadvantages and drawbacks characteristic of conventional PRIOR ART mail handling and sorting systems, and wherein originally random pieces of both types of mail, presented or delivered into the system in a random letter/flat mixed input, can be conveyed, sorted, and placed into a desirable delivery-walk or serial address sequence as a result of being conveyed or processed by means of only a single pass through the system.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The foregoing and other objectives are achieved in accordance with the teachings and principles of the present invention through the provision of a new and improved automatic postal mail transporting, handling, and sorting system which comprises an upstream letters/flats mixed input feeder, and a bar code reader/optical character reader (BCR/OCR) disposed immediately downstream from the letters/flats mixed input feeder. The bar code reader/optical character reader thus receives a mixed input of letters and flats from the upstream letters/flats mixed input feeder and reads the bar code or optical character information disposed upon the letters and flats, it being appreciated that such read information corresponds, for example, to the particular delivery addresses to which the letters and flats are to be respectively delivered. This read information is then automatically entered into the memory of the central processing unit (CPU) or other similar computer-control system which has been integrated into the overall automatic mail handling and sorting system, and in this manner, further conveyance and sorting of each individual piece of letter mail and flat mail is able to be precisely controlled so as to thereby determine, in turn, precisely where each letter and flat is in fact to be routed so as to facilitate the correct delivery of the letters and flats to their ultimate delivery addresses.</p>
    <p>More particularly, downstream from the bar code reader/optical character reader, the letters and flats are transported or conveyed to a letters/flats transporter/sorter conveyor section which comprises a plurality of letters/flats sequencing modules within which the letters and flats are actually sorted into the delivery sequence format. Each sequencing module comprises a loading mechanism and a storage mechanism, and a sorting gate, formed within the letters/flats transporter/sorter conveyor, is operatively associated with each sequencing module so as to effectively divert a particular letter or flat piece of mail from the transporter/sorter conveyor into a particular sequencing module when the particular sorting gate is opened or moved to its diverter mode or position by means of the computer control system. The storage mechanism comprises a plurality of vertically spaced storage trays which are mounted upon a flexible drive conveyor and which sequentially correspond to the delivery address destinations, within a defined delivery area or region, such as, for example, a particular street, road, avenue, or the like, to which the letter and flat mail pieces are to be delivered by means of the postal carrier. The loading mechanism similarly comprises a plurality of vertically spaced loading trays which are also mounted upon a flexible drive conveyor and which are adapted to receive a single letter or flat piece of mail from the transporter/sorter conveyor as a result of the particular sequencing module gate diverting a particular letter or flat piece of mail from the transporter/sorter conveyor into the particular sequencing module. During a complete mail transporting, handling, and sorting operation or cycle, the storage conveyor is maintained stationary so as to receive individual letters or flats from the loading mechanism conveyor, whereas the loading mechanism conveyor is incrementally moved so as to receive individual letters and flats from the transporter/sorter conveyor and to deliver each received individual letter or flat to a designated one of the storage trays disposed upon the storage mechanism conveyor.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, at the conclusion of an entire mail transporting, handling, and sorting operation or cycle, all of the letters and flats are deposited within the correct storage trays of the storage mechanism conveyor. It is to be remembered that the storage trays of the storage mechanism conveyor are disposed in delivery address sequence and therefore, in effect, all of the letters and flats have now been automatically sorted and deposited upon the storage mechanism conveyor in delivery address sequence. Accordingly, at the conclusion of the entire mail transporting, handling, and sorting operation or cycle, the storage mechanism conveyor may be actuated so as to discharge all letters and flats from each storage tray of the storage mechanism conveyor in a serial manner into, for example, a sequenced mail tub or storage container which is then conveyed downstream for use by the postal carrier in delivering the delivery address sequenced mail to the proper delivery address destinations.</p>

    <p>FIG. 6 is an enlarged side elevational detail view, similar to that of FIG. 3, showing however the storage mechanism of the sequencing module shown in FIG. 2; and</p>
    <p>FIG. 7 is a schematic diagram, similar to that of FIG. 1, illustrating however the overall layout of a second semi-automatic letter/flat mail handling, transporting, and sorting system constructed in accordance with the principles and teachings of the present invention for likewise sorting in one pass an initially random mix of letters and flats into a delivery address sequence for delivery sequence by a postal mail carrier.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading> <p>Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to FIG. 1 thereof, a first fully automatic letter/flat mail handling, transporting, and sorting system, constructed in accordance with the principles and teachings of the present invention for sorting an initially random mix of letters and flats into a delivery address sequence for sequence delivery by a postal mail carrier, is illustrated and is designated by the reference character <b>10</b>. Briefly, and from an overall point of view, mail pieces coming into the system <b>10</b> so as to be processed in accordance with the operation of the system <b>10</b>, as developed in accordance with the principles and teachings of the present invention, will be flowing or conveyed from left to right. More particularly, as can be seen from FIG. 1, the incoming mail, which comprises a random mix of letters and flats, is initially input into a letters/flats feeder <b>12</b> by means of which the random mix of letters and flats is initially conveyed into a bar code reader/optical character reader (BCR/OCR) <b>14</b>. The bar code reader/optical character reader <b>14</b> is provided so as to read either the address bar code which is present upon, for example, substantially all of the letter mail pieces or articles, or alternatively, to optically character read address information which was originally printed or handwritten upon, for example, flat mail pieces or articles by means of the addressor or sender. In either case, the address bar code and optically character read address information, which has been read by means of the bar code reader/optical character reader <b>14</b>, comprises delivery address information concerning the delivery address to which the particular letter or flat mail article or piece is in fact to be delivered. This information is, in turn, input into a central processing unit (CPU) or other similar computer control system <b>16</b>, wherein central processing unit or similar computer control system <b>16</b> is now able to track every piece of letter mail and flat mail in the order in which the plurality of letters and flats have serially or sequentially passed through the bar code reader/optical character reader <b>14</b>. Accordingly, after passing through the bar code reader/optical character reader <b>14</b>, the plurality of letters and flats, which are obviously still in a random mix or random order as far as their delivery addresses are concerned, are conveyed further downstream by means of an upwardly inclined conveyor <b>18</b> so as to be conveyed onto a transporter/sorter conveyor <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p>The transporter/sorter conveyor <b>20</b> comprises a horizontally disposed conveyor which is disposed above a plurality of vertically oriented sequencing modules <b>22</b>, the components of which are shown in more detail within FIGS. 2-6, and it is seen that the transporter/sorter conveyor <b>20</b> is provided with a plurality of diverter gates <b>24</b>, only two of which are illustrated for clarity purposes. In reality, one diverter gate <b>24</b> is provided for each sequencing module <b>22</b> so as to divert particularly conveyed letter and flat mail pieces into a particular sequencing module <b>22</b>. It is to be appreciated that the diverter gates <b>24</b> are suitably or timely controlled by means of commands issued from the central processing unit or similar computer control system <b>16</b> in accordance with the delivery address information which appeared upon the particular letter and flat mail piece and which was of course previously read by means of the bar code reader/optical character reader <b>14</b> and transmitted therefrom to the central processing unit or control system <b>16</b>. It is to be further appreciated that the sequencing modules <b>22</b> comprise storage compartments, as will be discussed shortly hereafter, which correspond to destination delivery addresses to which the particular letter and flat mail pieces are to be delivered, and that the destination delivery address data or information which is represented by each individual storage compartment of each sequencing module <b>22</b> is also present within the central processing unit or control system <b>16</b> whereby the address information read from the input mail pieces can be correlated by the processing unit or control system <b>16</b> with the address information represented by each storage compartment. Accordingly, as a result of the actuation of a particular diverter gate <b>24</b> operatively associated with a particular sequencing module <b>22</b>, the particular letter or flat mail piece or article has undergone, in effect, a first step along its flow path toward being properly sorted and arranged in the ultimate delivery address sequence whereby the postal service carrier is then enabled or empowered to deliver all of their mail pieces in sequenced order to the various delivery addresses present upon their daily delivery route.</p>
    <p>Continuing further, and with particular reference now being made to FIG. 2, the structure of one of the plurality of sequencing modules <b>22</b> utilized within the system <b>10</b> is disclosed in detail, it being of course noted that the structure of all of the sequencing modules <b>22</b> is precisely the same. More particularly, each sequencing module <b>22</b> is seen to comprise a vertically oriented loading mechanism <b>26</b> and a vertically oriented storage mechanism <b>28</b>. The vertically oriented storage mechanism <b>28</b> is seen to comprise a vertically oriented flexible drive chain conveyor <b>30</b> which is routed around, for example, a lower drive pulley <b>32</b> and an upper idler pulley <b>34</b>, the flexible drive chain conveyor <b>30</b> being driven or movable in the counterclockwise direction such that the left side vertical run of the flexible drive chain conveyor <b>30</b> moves downwardly when the flexible drive chain conveyor <b>30</b> is driven, while the right side vertical run of the flexible drive chain conveyor <b>30</b> moves upwardly when the flexible drive chain conveyor <b>30</b> is driven. The flexible drive chain conveyor <b>30</b> is provided with a plurality of vertically spaced sets of storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b>, and it is noted that each one of the storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b> may comprise, for example, a wire form structure.</p>
    <p>It is additionally noted that while, in reality, storage trays, similar to storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b>, are spaced along the entire longitudinal extent of the flexible drive chain conveyor <b>30</b> such that sets of storage trays are also mounted upon the right side vertical run of the flexible drive chain conveyor <b>30</b> as illustrated in FIG. 6, FIG. 2 only discloses, in effect, the presence of storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b> as being mounted upon the left side vertical run of the flexible drive chain conveyor <b>30</b> for clarity purposes in connection with the operation of the sequencing system <b>10</b>, as will be discussed and explained more fully hereinafter. It is additionally noted that at each storage tray position or location defined along the longitudinal extent of the flexible drive chain conveyor <b>30</b>, each set of storage trays comprises a pair of laterally spaced or laterally adjacent storage trays, so as to minimize or shorten the required vertical height or extent of the storage mechanism <b>28</b> and that of the sequencing modules <b>22</b>, and still further, for the purposes of describing the operation of the sequencing system <b>10</b>, this disclosure will be confined in effect to the storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b> which are disposed only along the left side vertical run of the flexible drive chain conveyor <b>30</b>.</p>
    <p>More particularly, in accordance with the new and improved sequencing system <b>10</b> constructed in accordance with the principles and teachings of the present invention, each one of the storage trays of the vertically spaced sets of storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b> represents a street address along a particular street, road, lane, or the like. For example, storage tray <b>36</b> may represent, for example, the street address of “36 Main Street”, while storage tray <b>38</b> may likewise represent the street address “38 Main Street”, with the last storage tray correspondingly representing the street address “70 Main Street”. Accordingly, it is seen and appreciated that all of the storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b> disposed upon this particular storage mechanism <b>28</b> of this particular sequencing module <b>22</b> are arranged in a sequential or serial manner, and that such storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b> represent all of the street addresses, to which mail is to be delivered and which are correspondingly arranged in the same sequential or serial manner, upon a particular street, road, avenue or the like. It is of course to be additionally noted that the other sequencing modules <b>22</b> of the system <b>10</b> similarly represent street addresses of other streets, avenues, roads, and the like, and still further, it is also noted that a particular storage mechanism <b>28</b> of a particular sequencing module <b>22</b> can be tailored or modified, both in structure or actual use, in accordance with the required usage of the same in connection with, for example, the number of street addresses required to be serviced upon a particular street, road, avenue, or the like.</p>
    <p>With reference now being additionally made to FIGS. 3 and 4, it is seen that the vertically oriented loading mechanism <b>26</b> is seen to comprise a vertically oriented flexible drive chain conveyor <b>72</b> which is routed around, for example, a lower drive pulley <b>74</b> and an upper drive pulley <b>76</b>, the flexible drive chain conveyor <b>72</b> being driven or movable in the clockwise direction such that the left side vertical run of the flexible drive chain conveyor <b>72</b> moves upwardly when the flexible drive chain conveyor <b>72</b> is being driven, while the right side vertical run of the flexible drive chain conveyor <b>72</b> moves downwardly when the flexible drive chain conveyor <b>72</b> is being driven. The flexible drive chain conveyor <b>72</b> is provided with a plurality of vertically spaced loading trays <b>78</b>, and it is noted that each one of the loading trays <b>78</b> may comprise, for example, a wire form structure. Each loading tray <b>78</b> is adapted to receive conveyed letter and flat mail pieces from the transporter/sorter conveyor <b>20</b>, and is further adapted to discharge or unload the particular letter or flat mail piece onto a specific one of the storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b> in order to properly dispose the particular letter or flat mail piece in its proper delivery address sequence as determined by means of the storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b>. In order to achieve such operations by each loading tray <b>78</b>, and as may best be appreciated from FIG. 4, in addition to each loading tray <b>78</b> being capable of vertical movement as a result of its attachment to the vertically oriented flexible drive chain conveyor <b>72</b>, each loading tray <b>78</b> is also capable of horizontal movement substantially within its own plane. More particularly, each loading tray <b>78</b> is laterally movable between a laterally central load position <b>78</b>C, as shown by means of the solid lines in FIG. 4, at which the loading tray <b>78</b> receives a particular letter or mail piece from the transporter/sorter conveyor <b>20</b>, and a pair of laterally offset left and right positions <b>78</b>L,<b>78</b>R, as shown by means of the dotted lines in FIG. 4, at which the loading tray <b>78</b> positionally corresponds to the disposition or location of one of the storage trays comprising each set of laterally adjacent storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b> such that the particular loading tray <b>78</b> can discharge or unload a particular letter or flat mail piece onto a particular one of the laterally adjacent storage trays comprising each set of storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b>. It is to be noted that the lateral offset movement to the left or right positions <b>78</b>L, <b>78</b>R of each loading tray <b>78</b> occurs immediately following the reception of a particular letter or mail piece into a particular loading tray <b>78</b> from the transporter/sorter conveyor <b>20</b> in preparation for its ultimate discharge or deposition into a particular one of the storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b> when the particular loading tray <b>78</b> is subsequently moved to an elevational position corresponding to the location of the particular storage tray <b>36</b>-<b>70</b>.</p>
    <p>Still further, as may best be appreciated as a result of additional reference being made to, for example, FIG. 5<i>a, </i>the structure of each loading tray <b>78</b> is seen to comprise a base member <b>80</b> which is attached to the vertically oriented flexible drive chain conveyor <b>72</b>, and a movable tray member <b>82</b> which is slidable upon the base member <b>80</b>. The rear or trailing end portion of the slidable tray member <b>82</b> has an upstanding finger or pusher member <b>84</b> operatively associated therewith, and the forward or leading end portion of the slidable tray member <b>82</b> has a door or flap member <b>86</b> operatively associated therewith wherein the door or flap member <b>86</b> is pivotally movable between vertically upstanding and horizontally lowered positions. Accordingly, as may be further appreciated from FIGS. 5<i>b</i>-<b>5</b> <i>g</i>, when a particular letter or flat piece of mail, already loaded upon or present within a movable tray member <b>82</b> of a particular one of the loading trays <b>78</b> as a result of having been deposited therein by means of the transporter/sorter conveyor <b>20</b>, is to be discharged or unloaded into a particular one of the storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b>, the particular loading tray <b>78</b>, having also been previously moved to either one of its left or right unload positions <b>78</b>L, <b>78</b>R as seen in FIG. 4 so as to positionally correspond to the location of the particular one of the storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b> into which the particular letter or flat piece of mail is to be deposited, is now moved to an elevational level which essentially corresponds to that of the particular one of the storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b> into which the particular letter or flat piece of mail is to be deposited.</p>
    <p>Subsequently, the slidable tray member <b>82</b> is moved to the right relative to the base member <b>80</b> as seen in FIG. 5<i>b</i>, and as the slidable tray member <b>82</b> continues to move toward the right, the leading edge door or flap member <b>86</b> is pivoted downwardly so as to now be disposed in its horizontal mode as shown in FIG. 5<i>c </i>whereby the particular letter or flat mail piece is able to be discharged or unloaded from the particular loading tray <b>78</b> and onto a particular one of the storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b>. The slidable tray member <b>82</b> is then retracted or moved backwardly towards its initial position as shown in FIG. 5<i>d</i>, and it will be appreciated that the structure of the loading tray assembly <b>78</b> is such that the slidable tray member <b>82</b> is also movable at this time with respect to or relative to the upstanding finger or pusher member <b>84</b>. Accordingly, the upstanding finger or pusher member <b>84</b> serves to retain, in effect, the letter or flat piece of mail at its extended position with respect to the particular storage tray <b>36</b>-<b>70</b> such that when the slidable tray member <b>82</b> is substantially fully withdrawn or retracted back to its original position as illustrated in FIG. 5<i>e</i>, the particular letter or flat piece of mail will have been unloaded and discharged or deposited into a particular one of the storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b>. At this time, the upstanding finger or pusher member <b>84</b> is also retracted or moved backwardly toward its original disposition with respect to the slidable tray member <b>82</b>, and the leading edge door or flap member <b>86</b> is again pivotally raised to its upstanding position as seen in FIG. 5<i>f </i>whereupon the loading tray assembly <b>78</b> is now disposed in its original position as seen in FIG. 5<i>g </i>which corresponds to its original mail receiving mode or position shown in FIG. 5<i>a. </i> </p>
    <p>Having described essentially all of the detailed structure comprising the new and improved automatic letter/flat mail handling, transporting, and sorting system <b>10</b>, which has been constructed in accordance with the principles and teachings of the present invention for sorting an initially random mix of letters and flats into a delivery address sequence for street delivery sequence by a postal mail carrier, the overall operation of the system <b>10</b> will now be described. Letter and flat pieces of mail, randomly mixed together both physically and with respect to their ultimate delivery address destinations, are conducted by means of the upwardly inclined conveyor <b>18</b> toward the transporter/sorter conveyor <b>20</b> after having passed through the bar code reader/optical character reader <b>14</b>. It is to be remembered that as a result of having passed through the bar code reader/optical character read <b>14</b>, delivery address information is obtained by the bar code reader/optical character reader <b>14</b> and transmitted to the central processing unit or computer control system <b>16</b> which is also operatively connected to the transporter/sorter conveyer <b>20</b>, including all of the gate members <b>24</b> thereof, as well as to all of the sequencing modules <b>22</b>.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, as the plurality of letters and flats are serially conveyed by means of the upwardly inclined conveyor <b>18</b> and conveyed toward and onto the transporter/sorter conveyor <b>20</b>, the processing unit or computer <b>16</b> is precisely aware of which particular letters and flats are being conveyed, including of course their destination delivery address information, as well as the serial order in which the particular letters and flats are being conveyed. Consequently, depending upon the particular destination delivery address information of particular letters or flats, the computer or processor <b>16</b> will control the actuation of a particular diverter gate <b>24</b> so as to cause a particular letter or flat to be diverted into a particular sequencing module <b>22</b> within which one of the storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b> represents a street delivery address which corresponds to the street delivery address appearing upon the particularly diverted letter or flat.</p>
    <p>Once the particular letter or flat is diverted by means of the particular diverter gate <b>24</b> into the particular one of the sequencing modules <b>22</b>, it is deposited within the first or uppermost one of the loading trays <b>78</b>. As additional letters and flats are introduced into the same sequencing module <b>22</b>, the loading mechanism conveyor <b>72</b> is sequentially actuated so as to in effect be indexed incremental amounts whereby successive loading trays <b>78</b> are incrementally moved into the first or uppermost position so as to respectively receive the additional letters and flats whereby a single letter or flat is deposited within each one of the loading trays <b>78</b>. As has been previously noted, immediately following the loading of a particular mail piece into a particular one of the loading trays <b>78</b>, the particular loading tray <b>78</b> is firstly moved to one of its lateral unloading positions <b>78</b>L or <b>78</b>R corresponding to the particular one of the storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b> into which the particular letter or flat mail piece is to be discharged. Consequently, the particular one of the loading trays <b>78</b>, having disposed therein the particular letter or flat mail which of course has a delivery address thereon which corresponds to a particular one of the delivery addresses represented by a particular one of the storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b>, is then moved downwardly so as to be disposed at an elevational level which corresponds to that particular one of the storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b> into which the letter and flat mail is to be discharged, and subsequently, the aforenoted structural components of that particular loading tray <b>78</b> are then actuated in accordance with the sequential operation as disclosed within FIGS. 5<i>a</i>-<b>5</b> <i>g</i>, and as previously described, whereby the particular letter or flat mail is unloaded from the particular loading tray <b>78</b> so as to be transferred to and deposited into the particular one of the storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b>. This process is then of course repeated until all of the mail pieces are transferred from the loading trays <b>78</b> into the properly designated delivery address storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b> with all mail pieces for any particular one of the storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b> being deposited within that particular storage tray. In other words, a particular one of the storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b> contains only mail pieces which have addresses which correspond to the street delivery address represented by means of that particular storage tray. It is additionally noted that during the entire process wherein letter and flat mail is being deposited into the loading trays <b>78</b> and subsequently transferred from particular loading trays <b>78</b> into the particular storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b>, the vertically oriented flexible drive chain conveyor <b>30</b> is maintained stationary.</p>
    <p>It is also noted that for those loading trays <b>78</b> which are disposed upon the left side vertical run of the loading mechanism conveyor <b>72</b> and which are not being employed to receive letter and flat mail pieces from the transporter/sorter conveyor <b>20</b>, such loading trays <b>78</b> are in effect pivoted upwardly adjacent the left side vertical run of the loading mechanism conveyor <b>72</b>, as seen in FIGS. 2 and 3, so as to conserve lateral space between adjacent sequencing modules <b>22</b> as may be appreciated from FIG. <b>1</b>. Accordingly, it may be readily appreciated that regardless of the random mix or order in which all of the letters and flats were initially disposed or arranged, as a result of all of the letters and flats being respectively deposited or loaded into their respectively proper storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b>, all of the letters and flats are now automatically arranged in a delivery address sequence which corresponds to the delivery address sequence defined upon a particular route along which a postal carrier will deliver his or her daily mail. Still yet further, it is also noted that all of the mail has been processed and arranged in the aforenoted delivery address sequence as a result of only a single pass of all of the mail pieces through the system <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>When a complete load or batch of letters and flats has been processed whereby all of the letters and flats are now disposed within their respectively proper or correct delivery address storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b>, the next step in the entire sequencing operation is to effectively unload the letters and flats from their respective storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b>. As seen in FIG. 1, each sequencing module <b>22</b>, and more particularly, each storage mechanism <b>28</b> thereof, has a collection container or tub <b>88</b> disposed beneath the lower end portion of each storage mechanism <b>28</b> so as to actually be disposed beneath the left vertical side run of the vertically oriented flexible drive chain conveyor <b>30</b>. Accordingly, when the storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b> are to be unloaded into their respective containers or tubs <b>88</b>, the flexible drive chain conveyor <b>30</b>, which has up to this point in time been maintained stationary, is now actuated so as to incrementally index the lowermost set of storage trays <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> to a discharge position as illustrated more clearly in FIG. 6 at which the set of storage trays <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> is moved toward the right, as designated by the dotted lines, to a retracted position whereby the letters and flats disposed within the storage trays <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> will fall downwardly into the collection tub or container <b>88</b>.</p>
    <p>While not shown in detail in FIG. 6, the actual structure of each storage tray may be somewhat similar to the structure of any one of the loading trays <b>78</b> as more particularly disclosed within FIGS. 5<i>a</i>-<b>5</b> <i>g </i>in that each one of the storage trays may be slidable, in a manner similar to that of slidable tray member <b>82</b>, and may also preferably include an upstanding finger or pusher member, similar to pusher or finger member <b>84</b>, so as to facilitate the discharge of the letter and flat mail from the respective storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b>. Upon retraction of the storage trays <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> and the discharge of the letter and flat mail therefrom into the collection tub or container <b>88</b>, the vertically oriented flexible drive chain conveyor <b>30</b> will again be incrementally actuated so as to now dispose the next set of storage trays <b>64</b>, <b>66</b> at the lowermost discharge position whereupon retraction of the storage trays <b>64</b>, <b>66</b> in the manner disclosed in FIG. 6, the letter and flat mail stored within the storage trays <b>64</b>, <b>66</b> will now be disposed within the collection tub or container <b>88</b> so as to, for example, be disposed atop the letter and flat mail previously discharged from storage trays <b>68</b>, <b>70</b>. As can be readily appreciated, the entire mail unloading or discharge process is repeated until all of the storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b> have been emptied whereby all of the letter and flat mail has been discharged into the collection tub or container <b>88</b>. It can therefore be further appreciated that all of the letter and flat mail is now disposed within the collection tub or container <b>88</b> in a stacked, delivery address sequential or serial manner whereby the mail is readied for delivery by a postal service carrier in the required delivery route address sequence. As was the case with the loading trays <b>78</b>, after the storage trays have been emptied and are now disposed upon the right side vertical run of the storage conveyor <b>30</b>, the storage trays are pivoted upwardly adjacent to the right side vertical run of the storage conveyor <b>30</b>, as seen in FIG. 6, so as to minimize adjacent spacing between the sequencing modules as can also be appreciated from FIG. <b>1</b>. It is lastly noted that the plurality of collection containers or tubs <b>88</b> are disposed upon a tub or container transport conveyor <b>90</b> by means of which all of the collection containers or tubs <b>88</b> may be conveyed to a downstream location at which the collection tubs or containers <b>88</b> can be loaded, for example, upon postal service carrier trucks so that the postal carriers can in fact deliver the mail to the designated address destinations located along their delivery routes.</p>
    <p>With reference lastly being made to FIG. 7, a second semi-automatic letter/flat mail handling, transporting, and sorting system, constructed in accordance with the principles and teachings of the present invention for sorting an initially random mix of letters and flats into a delivery address sequence for sequence delivery by a postal mail carrier, is illustrated and is designated by the reference character <b>110</b>. It is noted that the semi-automatic letter/flat mail handling and sorting system <b>110</b> is substantially identical to the automatic letter/flat mail handling and sorting system <b>10</b> as disclosed, for example, within FIG. 1, except as will be noted hereinafter, and therefore, component parts of the semi-automatic handling and sorting system <b>110</b> which correspond to the component parts of the automatic handling and sorting system <b>10</b> will be designated by corresponding reference characters except that the reference characters will be within the 100 series. Therefore, it is further noted, in the interest of brevity, that in view of the substantially identical structure comprising both the automatic and semi-automatic letter/flat mail handling and sorting systems <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, a detailed description of the semi-automatic letter/flat mail handling and sorting system <b>110</b> will not be provided, but the description of the same will only be directed to the major difference between the two systems <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>.</p>
    <p>In particular, then, the only substantial difference between the two automatic and semi-automatic letter/mail handling and sorting systems <b>10</b>, <b>110</b> resides in the fact that in accordance with the semi-automatic system <b>110</b> as disclosed within FIG. 7, it is seen that the vertically oriented flexible drive chain conveyor <b>30</b>, having the pivotally movable storage trays <b>36</b>-<b>70</b> mounted thereon, has been eliminated, and in lieu thereof, a relatively fixed shelving system <b>130</b> is provided within each sequencing module <b>122</b> and in operative conjunction with each one of the vertically oriented flexible drive chain conveyor <b>172</b> of each loading mechanism <b>126</b>. Within each shelving system <b>130</b>, there is of course provided the sets of delivery address storage trays <b>136</b>-<b>170</b>, and consequently, the system <b>110</b> is substantially operatively identical to the operation of the system <b>10</b>. In view of the absence of the flexible drive chain conveyor <b>30</b>, the system <b>110</b> cannot of course automatically empty the delivery address storage trays <b>136</b>-<b>170</b> into the collection tubs or containers <b>188</b>, and therefore, each set of storage trays <b>136</b>-<b>170</b> is preferably provided with a slidable tray structure similar to the particular tray structure characteristic of the loading trays <b>78</b> as disclosed within FIGS. 5<i>a</i>-<b>5</b> <i>g </i>whereby personnel can manually move the slidable tray components outwardly in order to empty the sets of storage trays <b>136</b>-<b>170</b> when it is desired to empty the mail contents of such storage trays <b>136</b>-<b>170</b> into the collection tubs or containers <b>188</b>. In addition to the elimination of the flexible drive chain conveyor <b>30</b>, the collection tub or container transport conveyor <b>90</b> may likewise be eliminated whereby the collection tubs or containers <b>188</b> would have to be manually removed to the downstream distribution location. The semi-automatic handling and sorting system <b>110</b> is thus appreciated to be a somewhat less expensive version of the automatic handling and sorting system <b>10</b> and therefore provides economic advantages when compared to the fully automatic letter/flat mail handling and sorting system <b>10</b> as disclosed within FIG. <b>1</b>.</p>
    <p>Thus, it may be seen that in accordance with the teachings and principles of the present invention, there has been provided a mixed input letter/flat mail handling and sorting system which is able to handle and sort an initially random mix of letters and flats whereby the system can place all of the letters and flats into delivery address sequence, for address sequence delivery by a postal carrier, as a result of only a single pass of such letters and flats through the system.</p>
    <p>Obviously, many variations and modifications of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the present invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein.</p>
