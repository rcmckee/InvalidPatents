At least one embodiment describes a supercharged internal combustion engine in which a supercharging portion of air is compressed, cooled and injected late in the compression process. A sub-normal compression ratio or low “effective” compression ratio initial air charge is received by a cylinder/compression chamber on the engine intake process, which during compression produces only a fraction of heat-of-compression as that produced by a conventional engine. During compression process, dense, cooled supercharging air charge is injected, adding density and turbulence above that of conventional engines with low “effective” compression ratio for this portion of air charge also. Compression continues and near piston top dead center, the air charge being mixed with fuel is ignited for power pulse followed by scavenging.</div>

<p num="p-0003">The present invention constitutes a new working cycle for internal combustion engines, with methods and apparatuses for managing combustion charge density, temperatures, pressures and turbulence (among other characteristics). At least one embodiment describes a cold air super-charged internal combustion engine in which a super-charging portion of air is compressed, cooled or chilled and injected late in the compression process.</p>
  <p num="p-0004">Initial air charge for 4-stroke engines and for epitrochoid (Wankel) type rotary and straight rotary engines: A sub-normal compression ratio or a low “effective” compression ratio initial air charge (A) is received on the intake process, which during the compression process, produces only a fraction of the heat-of-compression as that produced by a conventional engine.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">Super-charging air: During the compression process, a dense, cooled or chilled supplementary air charge (B) is injected into the engine, adding density and turbulence above that of conventional engines and producing a low compression ratio or a low “effective” compression ratio for this portion of air charge also. Compression of the combined charge continues and near piston or rotor top dead center (TDC) position, the air charge, being mixed with fuel, is ignited for the power pulse, followed by scavenging, air intake and compression process to complete one power cycle.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">For 2-stroke engines: In 2-stroke engines, reciprocating, epitrochoid-action or straight rotary, the cold supplementary air charge (B) is injected during the compression process after a low compression ratio engine or a low “effective” compression ratio process engine has been scavenged and charged with fresh air (A). Compression continues and near piston or rotor top dead center (TDC) position, the fuel-air charge is ignited, producing the power pulse, scavenging, fresh air charging and compression process, thus completing one power cycle.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">The charge density is selectively much greater than that of state-of-art engines, providing greater power and torque with increased efficiency, while producing ultra low polluting emissions.</p>
  <heading>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0008">It is well known that as the expansion ratio, as compared to charge density of an internal combustion engine is increased, more energy is extracted from the combustion gases and converted to kinetic energy, increasing the thermodynamic efficiency of the engine. It is further understood that increasing air charge density increases both power and fuel economy due to further thermodynamic improvements. The objectives for an efficient engine are to provide a high-density charge, to begin combustion at maximum density and then to expand the gases as far as possible against a piston, vane or rotor lobe.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">It is further known that if the air-fuel charge of an engine is homogeneous, the elimination of cycle-to-cycle variations in components, (pressures, air-fuel ratios, temperatures, etc.), will greatly improve engine performance.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">It is also well known that if an air-fuel mixture has a high air content, and because fuel is fully mixed with air before combustion, the fuel bums cooler bringing the bum temperature below the threshold at which it would damage the pistons.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">It is also an established principle that the lower the temperature of a standard density charge is at the time of ignition, the lower the comparative peak temperature and pressure produced which further reduces polluting emissions, especially NO<sub>X</sub>.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">Now, the compression ratio of current engine technology sets the level to which a piston “compacts” a mix of air and fuel before the charge is ignited and hence sets the limits of power and efficiency. If the ratio is too high in gasoline or gas engines, the fuel ignites itself as it does in a Diesel engine. Although efficiency is high with a Diesel engine, polluting emissions, including particulates (smoke and nano-particles, all caused by pre-mixed fuel-bum) make it a health hazard.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">The engine of this invention is capable of producing the same “compactness” of charge and an even denser charge than that of the Diesel engine, but without having a high compression ratio or producing excessively high temperature. The charge is introduced and managed in such a manner that regardless of the charge density, the temperature of the charge can be kept below auto-ignition temperature of the fuel until the point for ignition. The homogeneous charge then bums cooler and more completely for truly clean power production.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">Described herein is a unique engine, which, within its combustion chambers, produces a lighter than normal or denser than normal, temperature-adjusted homogeneous air-fuel mixture. The temperature of the charge is so managed that at 10-15 degrees before piston top dead center (TDC), the charge can be very low and optionally below auto-ignition temperature, and it is at that point that the charge is ignited by spark, heat infusion or heat profusion or by catalyst for high torque, power and efficiency with ultra low polluting emissions.</p>
  <heading>Gasoline and Natural Gas Auto-Ignition Engine Concept Under Development by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL), et al.</heading> <heading>Discussion of a Novel Engine Concept</heading> <p num="p-0015">HCCI is an abbreviation of “Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition.” Scientists have discovered that at some engine speeds and loads, the combustion in internal combustion engines became more stable and that an engine ran smoother when the fuel was auto-ignited, instead of being ignited by sparkplug. As the name implies, the homogeneous (“well mixed”) charge of air and fuel is ignited by compression heat.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition, or HCCI, is a relatively new combustion technology. It is a hybrid of the traditional spark ignition (SI) and the compression ignition process (such as the Diesel engine). A project at the UC Berkeley Combustion Analysis Laboratory (CAL) is to focus on the experimental side of HCCI. Data collected there is being used to validate the computational models generated by engineers at Lawrence Livermore National Lab (LLNL). Entec Engine Corporation, Atlanta, Ga. is an integral part of the continuing effort to make practical an HCCI engine to provide low emission, high efficiency power generation as well as for transportation.</p>
  <p num="p-0017">Unlike a traditional SI or Diesel engine, true HCCI combustion takes place spontaneously and homogeneously without flame propagation. This eliminates heterogeneous air/fuel mixture regions. In addition, HCCI is a lean combustion process. These conditions translate to a lower local flame temperature which lowers the amount of NO<sub>X </sub>produced in the process. NO<sub>X </sub>is a gas that is believed to be responsible for the creation of ozone (O3).</p>
  <heading>The Principal of the HCCI Engine Concept</heading> <p num="p-0018">As mentioned above, the HCCI-engine can be seen as a hybrid of the SI-engine and the Diesel engine. First, we will describe the SI and Diesel engines.</p>
  <p num="p-0019">In the SI-engine, a homogeneous mixture of fuel and air is ignited at the end of the compression stroke by a spark. The spark causes a flame kernel that grows and propagates throughout the combustion chamber. By controlling the mixture flow to the engine with a throttle plate, the engine load (torque) is changed. The mixture ratio between air and fuel is kept almost constant at all loads.</p>
  <p num="p-0020">In the Diesel engine, pure air is compressed. The fuel is injected under high pressure at the end of the compression stroke into the hot compressed air. The fuel is vaporized and mixed partially before self-ignition occurs. The load is adjusted by varying the amount of fuel injected.</p>
  <p num="p-0021">In the HCCI-engine, homogeneous air-fuel mixture is compressed so that auto-ignition occurs when the piston is near the top dead center position (TDC). A high compression ratio is necessary in order to ensure auto-ignition. Very lean mixtures have to be used in order to get slow chemistry that reduces the combustion rate. Diluted mixtures can be achieved by using a high air-fuel ratio or by Exhaust Gas Recycling (EGR). Varying the amount of fuel controls the load. Like the Diesel engine, there is no throttle plate i.e., the engine will always get maximum amount of air flow as-the engine is un-throttled.</p>
  <heading>Advantages of the HCCI Engine</heading> <p num="p-0022">The HCCI-engine is always un-throttled. A high compression ratio is used and the combustion is fast. This provides high efficiency at low loads, compared to a SI-engine that has low efficiency at part load. According to computational models generated by engineers at LLNL, an HCCI engine will reduce fuel consumption to one half of that in an ordinary automobile engine. The formation of nitrogen-oxides is strongly dependent on combustion temperature. Higher temperature gives higher amounts of NO<sub>X</sub>. Therefore, since the combustion charge is homogeneous and a very lean mixture is used, the combustion temperature becomes very low, which results in very low amounts of NO<sub>X</sub>. LLNL predicts that the HCCI engine will also virtually eliminate soot (particulates) and NO<sub>X</sub>.</p>
  <heading>Disadvantages of the Current HCCI Engine Concept as Being Developed by LLNL, et al.</heading> <p num="p-0023">The control of the combustion is more difficult in the HCCI engine than in the SI or Diesel engines. The HCCI engine provides no direct control of the start of combustion. In other words, there is no “triggering” mechanism as a spark or an injection of fuels into a super-hot air-charge, as in conventional engines. The start of combustion depends on several parameters. The strongest ones are the compression ratio and the air charge inlet temperature. Also, there is no means of separately controlling charge density and temperature. By adjusting these parameters in “the right way,” it is possible to control the start of combustion to a desired moment. Another current disadvantage in their concept is high levels of hydrocarbons (HC), which is unburned fuel. The low combustion temperature causes the fuel to burn incompletely.</p>
  <heading>Potential of the Current HCCI Engine Concept</heading> <p num="p-0024">An appropriate field of operation is power plants where the engines operate with constant speed. Present concepts of the HCCI-engine would compete favorably with natural gas driven SI-engines due to the higher efficiency and lower NO<sub>X </sub>emissions. One interesting concept would be to use HCCI combustion at part load conditions and SI combustion at high loads in a car engine. In this way, the fuel consumption would be reduced significantly. Researchers say if the emissions standards should rise and the problem with the HC emissions could be solved, the HCCI engine would be able to compete favorably with the Diesel engine, since the Diesel combustion causes high NO<sub>X</sub>, soot particulates and other emissions.</p>
  <heading>Why HCCI?</heading> <p num="p-0025">The modern conventional SI engine, fitted with a three-way catalyst, can be seen as a very clean engine, but it suffers from poor part load efficiency. As mentioned earlier, this is mainly due to the throttling. Engines in passenger cars operate most of the time at light and part load conditions. For some shorter periods of time, at overtaking and acceleration, they run at high loads, but they seldom run at high loads for any long periods. This means that the overall efficiency at normal driving conditions becomes very low.</p>
  <p num="p-0026">The Diesel engine has a much higher part load efficiency than the SI engine. Instead, the Diesel engine fights with great smoke and NO<sub>X </sub>problems. Soot (particulates) is mainly formed in the fuel rich regions and NO<sub>X </sub>in the hot stoichiometric regions. Due to these mechanisms, it is difficult to reduce both smoke and NO<sub>X </sub>simultaneously through combustion improvement. Today, there is no well working exhaust after treatment that takes away both soot and NO<sub>X</sub>.</p>
  <p num="p-0027">The HCCI engine has much higher part load efficiency than the SI engine and is comparable to the Diesel engine. It has no problem with NO<sub>X </sub>and soot (particulates) formation like the Diesel engine. In summary, the HCCI-engine beats the SI engine regarding the efficiency and the Diesel engine regarding the emissions.</p>
  <p num="p-0028">The foregoing discussion of the anticipated operating features show that when the HCCI system is successfully developed, according to the present plans of various labs and engine research groups, it will have a low-density air charge for low efficiency and power for diesel fuel, but will be clean burning and have the efficiency of the Diesel engine if using gasoline or natural gas fuel.</p>
  <heading>Advantages of the Engine of this Present Invention, the Gasoline, Natural Gas, Hydrogen &amp; New Diesel Fueled, Spark or Auto-Ignition Engine</heading> <p num="p-0029">The present invention described herein promises to make practical the HCCI-engine and provides all of the hoped for advantages stated for the futuristic HCCI-engine concept. In addition, the present invention provides many other engine improvements not anticipated for the HCCI-engine e.g., greater power and efficiency for diesel operation, whether ignited by spark or as an HCCI engine.</p>
  <p num="p-0030">The engine of this present invention provides a homogenized air-fuel charge, which can always be much denser than that of the Diesel engine and, in some designs, has an extended expansion ratio, yet with compression temperatures lower than those which would cause auto-ignition prematurely. It can be ignited by spark, compression, modified HCCI or true HCCI. Other advantages are no-knock operation, multi-fuel capabilities, double burning “dwell” time near TDC with improved power, torque, efficiency and durability and greatly reduced NO<sub>X</sub>, CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, formaldehyde, HC and particulates. Knock-free operation allows reduction or elimination of the gasoline additive methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) which is currently polluting ground water.</p>
  <p num="p-0031">The present invention describes a means of selectively managing the density, pressure and temperature of an air or air-fuel charge with each feature being separately adjustable with regard to the other features. This selective management provides the same reduction in NO<sub>X</sub>, particulates and other polluting emissions as projected for HCCI, while providing greater power, efficiency and engine durability.</p>
  <p num="p-0032">The density of the final air-fuel charge can be much greater even than that of the Diesel engine and yet has a temperature low enough to prevent knock or pre-auto-ignition. For example, natural gas-air mix auto-ignites at a compression ratio of 19:1 or 20:1, while diesel fuel-air mix auto-ignites at the temperature produced by a compression ratio of about 8:1. Therefore, using diesel fuel in a HCCI engine, under development by LLNL, et al., would greatly reduce its efficiency and power. But, in the present invention, the charge can be “compacted” to an effective compression ratio of as much as 40:1 or greater, with a temperature lower than that normally produced by an 8:1 compression ratio. The engine of this invention can then ignite the charge for greater than “Diesel” power and efficiency.</p>
  <p num="p-0033">Currently, according to researchers, the greatest problems in making the HCCI engine feasible are timing of ignition and the problem of temperature control in regard to compression ratio. In their HCCI engine concept, the temperature of the compressed charge can not be kept low, thus severely limiting power and efficiency in HCCI for all fuels. The present invention allows the control of the temperature and density of the charge separately, for much greater steady-state power density and fuel economy, with ultra-low emissions and timely ignition control for all fuels, liquid or gaseous.</p>
  <p num="p-0034">Described herein are several alternate means of timely igniting the charge of the present invented engine e.g., a) spark ignited, b) compression ignited, c) by modified HCCI, and d) by true HCCI operation.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0035">Briefly described, the present invention comprises an internal combustion engine system, (including methods and apparatuses) optionally operating in a first mode and, optionally and selectively, in a second mode and optionally in a preferred third mode for managing combustion charge densities, temperatures, pressures and turbulence in order to produce a true mastery within the power cylinder to increase fuel economy, power, and torque while minimizing polluting emissions. In its preferred embodiments, the method includes the steps of (i) producing a primary air charge and optionally, a secondary air charge (ii) controlling the temperature, density and pressure of the air charges, (iii) transferring an air charge to a power cylinder of the engine in one stage for mode 1 operation and in two stages for mode 2 and mode 3 operation. The primary air charge is supplemented by the secondary air charge in producing mode 2 and mode 3 operation. This system is such that an air charge having a weight and density selected from a range of weight and density levels, ranging from less than atmospheric weight and density to a heavier-than-atmospheric weight and density, is introduced into the power cylinder, and (iv) then compressing the air charge at a normal, or a lower-than-normal compression ratio, (v) optionally introducing a secondary air or air-fuel charge into the same cylinder during the compression stroke, (vi) compressing the total charge, (vii) causing a pre-determined quantity of charge-air and fuel to produce a combustible mixture, (viii) causing the mixture to be ignited within the power cylinder and (ix) allowing the combustion gas to expand against a piston operable in the power cylinder with the expansion ratio of the power cylinder being equal to, or substantially greater than the compression ratio of the power cylinders of the engine. In addition to other advantages, the invented method is capable of producing mean effective [cylinder] pressures (mep) in a range ranging from lower-than-normal to higher-than-normal. In the preferred embodiments, the mean effective cylinder pressure is selectively variable (and selectively varied) throughout the mentioned range during the operation of the engine. In an alternate embodiment related to constant speed operation, the mean effective cylinder pressure is selected from the range and the engine is configured, in accordance with the present invention, so that the mean effective cylinder pressure range is limited, being varied only in the amount required for producing the power, torque and RPM of the duty cycle for which the engine is designed.</p>
  <p num="p-0036">In its preferred embodiments, the apparatus of the present invention provides a reciprocating internal combustion engine with at least one atmospheric air intake port for providing charge air to two different cylinder inlet ports at different pressures. The apparatus also provides at least one ancillary compressor for pre-compressing a portion of the air charge, an intercooler, or heat exchanger, through or around which, the compressed air can be directed for temperature adjustment. The apparatus further provides power cylinders in which the combustion gas is ignited and expanded, a piston operable in each power cylinder, connected to a crankshaft by a connecting link for rotating the crankshaft in response to reciprocation of each piston and a transfer conduit communicating the compressor outlet to a control valve and to the intercooler or heat exchanger. Also provided is a transfer manifold communicating the intercooler, or bypass system, with the power cylinders, through which manifold the compressed charge is transferred to enter the power cylinders. The apparatus further provides one intake port or valve controlling admission of the low pressure (primary) air charge to the power cylinder, an intake valve controlling admission of the compressed (secondary) charge from the transfer manifold to said power cylinders, and an exhaust valve controlling discharge of the exhaust gases from said power cylinders.</p>
  <p num="p-0037">For the 4-stroke engine of this invention, one of two intake valves of the power cylinders is timed to operate so that a charge of air, which is lighter, equal to, or heavier than normal, can be received and maintained within a transfer manifold, when required. This charge of air can then be introduced into the power cylinder during the intake (primary) piston stroke with the intake valve closing at piston BDC, or closing substantially before piston BDC position or with the intake valve closing at some point after BDC, or near the end of the compression stroke to provide, in a first mode of operation, either a normal, a low, or a zero compression ratio. This establishes that the expansion ratio can be equal to or greater than the compression ratio of the power cylinders. In this design, in a second mode or third mode of operation, a second intake valve can open during the intake stroke or preferably during the compression stroke, or as late as near TDC, at the point or after the piston has reached the point where the first intake valve closes on either the intake or the compression stroke and closes quickly in order to inject a temperature adjusted high-pressure secondary air charge.</p>
  <p num="p-0038">Mode 1 Operation: The 2-stroke engine of this invention, also operating in optional triple modes, introduces lightly compressed scavenging and charging air into primary ports at piston BDC and is the sole air charge in mode 1 operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0039">For mode 2 or mode 3 operation, the intake valves of the power cylinders are timed to operate so that a high pressure supercharging air charge is cool and maintained within the transfer manifold, alternatively expansion chilled, and introduced into the power cylinder, during or near the end of the compression stroke, at such a time that the power cylinder has been scavenged and charged by air received from ports which are now closed and the exhaust valve has closed normally or late. This establishes that the expansion ratio of the engine can be equal to or greater than the compression ratio of the power cylinders. Means are provided in both 4-stroke and 2-stroke for causing fuel to be mixed with the air charge to produce a combustible mixture. The combustion chambers of the power cylinders are sized with respect to the displaced volume of the power cylinder in some designs to produce an initial low compression ratio so that the exploded combustion gas can be expanded to a volume equal to the compression ratio of the power cylinder of the engine.</p>
  <p num="p-0040">In other 2-stroke designs, the exhaust valve is closed late in order to produce an expansion ratio greater than the “effective” compression ratio.</p>
  <p num="p-0041">For mode 3 operation, modes 1 and 2 are combined.</p>
  <p num="p-0042">For both 4-stroke and 2-stroke engines, fuel being present, ignition of the charge occurs at near piston TDC and the power pulse occurs as fully described hereafter.</p>
  <p num="p-0043">Some of the advantages of the present invention over existing internal combustion engines are, as stated earlier, that it can provide a normal compression ratio or an “effective” compression ratio lower than the expansion ratio of the engine and can selectively provide a mean effective cylinder pressure higher than the conventional engine arrangement with the same or lower maximum cylinder pressure and temperature than that of prior art engines. In addition, the invention, in some designs, alternatively provides for double the burn time over existing engines by providing “Dwell”-burn time at piston TDC.</p>
  <p num="p-0044">Because charge density, temperature and pressure are managed separately, light-load operation is practical, even for extended periods, with no sacrifice of fuel economy. The new working cycle is applicable to 2-stroke or 4-stroke engines, spark-ignited, compression-ignited and modified or true HCCI. For all engines, the weight of the charge can be greatly increased without the usual problems of high peak temperatures and pressures with the usual attendant problem of combustion detonation and pre-ignition. (Even in compression-ignited Diesel engines, a heavier, cooler, more turbulent air charge provides low peak cylinder pressure for a given expansion ratio and allows richer, smoke-limited air-fuel ratio giving increased power with lower particulate and NO<sub>X </sub>emissions.) Modified HCCI or true HCCI operation will provide greater than “diesel efficiency”, using gasoline, natural gas, hydrogen or diesel fuels, while limiting NO<sub>X </sub>and particulate emissions (both smoke and nano-particle) but with diesel and hydrogen fuel performance being most benefited. Compression work is reduced due to reduced heat transfer during the compression process. Engine durability is improved because of an overall cooler working cycle and a cooler than normal exhaust and, in some duty cycles, by lower RPM, allowed by greater torque. Due to the ability to greatly increase air-fuel charge density and turbulence, even above that of diesel engines, while controlling the temperature and keeping it below auto-ignition temperature using diesel oils, allows spark ignition for diesel type oils, thus eliminating smoke particles and NO<sub>X</sub>.</p>

  <heading>The Engine <b>100</b> <sup>1 </sup>of FIG. <b>1</b> Operating in Operational Designs 1-6</heading> <p num="p-0097">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a six cylinder reciprocating internal combustion engine <b>100</b> <sup>1 </sup>optionally operating in modes 1, 2 or a steady state method 3 and having one atmospheric air intake <b>9</b>, FIG. <b>1</b>. It is so constructed and arranged that a compressor <b>2</b> receives charge air from manifold <b>14</b>-B through openings <b>8</b>-B (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and conduit <b>8</b>′ which air enters through common air intake duct <b>9</b> of FIG. <b>3</b>. Intake conduits <b>15</b> <i>a</i>-C to <b>15</b> <i>f</i>-C distributes the low pressure air to the intake valves <b>16</b>-B of each power cylinder. This arrangement allows the provision of air to intake valves <b>16</b>-A and <b>16</b>-B at different pressure levels since the charge air from conduit <b>15</b>-A is selectively pressurized by compressor <b>2</b>. Intake conduits <b>15</b>-A, <b>15</b>-C, in which all of the cylinders (only one (<b>7</b>) of which is shown in a sectional view) <b>7</b> <i>a</i>-<b>7</b> <i>f </i>and associated pistons <b>22</b> <i>a</i>-<b>22</b> <i>f </i>operate in a 4-stroke cycle and all power cylinders are used for producing power to a common crankshaft <b>20</b> via connecting rods <b>19</b> <i>a</i>-<b>19</b> <i>f</i>, respectively. A compressor <b>2</b>, in FIG. <b>1</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, shows a Lysholm type rotary compressor which, with air conduits, as shown selectively, supplies pressurized air to one or more cylinder intake valves <b>16</b>A. An air inlet conduit <b>8</b>′ receives atmospheric air from a low-pressure manifold <b>14</b>-B which receives atmospheric air through inlet <b>9</b>, selectively compresses and cools the charge which then goes to intake valve <b>16</b>-B by way of conduit <b>32</b>, FIG. <b>2</b>. Inlet conduits <b>15</b>-A, <b>15</b>-C and <b>32</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> separately supply air charge at atmospheric pressure and air which has been compressed to a higher pressure to separate intake valves <b>16</b>-B and <b>16</b>-A, opening to the same cylinder <b>7</b> <i>a</i>-<b>7</b> <i>f </i>(for example, shown here opening to cylinder <b>7</b> <i>f</i>). Intercoolers <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> and control valves <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> are used in the preferred embodiments to control the air charge density, weight, temperature and pressure of the air charge going to intake valve <b>16</b>-A, while compressor <b>1</b>, intercooler <b>10</b> and conduit <b>32</b> optionally and selectively convey charge air to intake valve <b>16</b>-B. The intake valves <b>16</b> <i>a</i>-B-<b>16</b> <i>f</i>-B, which receive air through manifold <b>14</b>-B and intake conduits <b>15</b> <i>a</i>-C to <b>15</b> <i>f</i>-C or through conduit <b>8</b>′ and conduit <b>32</b>, are timed to control the compression ratio of the engine <b>100</b> <sup>1 </sup>in Operational Designs 3-6. The combustion chambers are sized to establish the compression ratio of the engine in Designs 1 and 2. Because of noticeable similarities between the engine <b>100</b> <sup>1 </sup>of FIG. <b>1</b> and that of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (where the atmospheric air inlet <b>9</b> system has been shown in phantom, for informational value), reference will be made as deemed helpful to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for certain common components.</p>
  <p num="p-0098">The engine <b>100</b> <sup>1 </sup>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is characterized by the ability to provide a normal expansion ratio in Operational Designs 1 and 2 and an extended expansion ratio and a low effective compression ratio in Operational Designs 3 through 6, with Design 4 having an effective compression ratio of near zero, perhaps 2:1 or less, and all capable of producing a combustion charge varying in weight from substandard to heavier-than-normal and capable of selectively providing a mean effective cylinder pressure higher than can the conventional arrangement in normal engines with lower maximum cylinder temperature in comparison to conventional engines. Engine Control Module (ECM) (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and variable valves <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b> on conduits, as shown, provide a system for controlling the charge pressure, density, temperature and mean and peak pressure within the cylinder, which allows greater fuel economy, production of greater power and torque, with low polluting emissions for spark ignited, compression ignited, modified HCCI, or true HCCI engines. In alternate embodiments, a variable valve timing system with the ECM-<b>27</b> can also control the time of opening and closing of the intake valves <b>16</b>-A and/or <b>16</b>-B to further provide an improved management of conditions in the combustion chambers to allow for a flatter torque curve and higher power, with low levels of both fuel consumption and polluting emissions. In another alternate embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-B</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-D</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11-B</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18-B</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, FIG. <b>21</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the engines of this invention and any current technology Otto or Diesel Cycle engine, or any other internal combustion engine, can utilize compression-expansion chilled charge air for greater power and efficiency and to lessen polluting emissions. (A design for Otto and Diesel Cycle engines, using refrigerated charge air, is depicted in and described for FIG. <b>2</b>-D).</p>
  <heading>Brief Description of Triple Mode Operation</heading> <p num="p-0099">The new cycle engine <b>100</b> <sup>1 </sup>of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a high efficiency engine that attains both high power and torque, with low fuel consumption and low polluting emissions. The new cycle is an external compression type combustion cycle. In this cycle, part of the intake air (all of which is compressed in the power cylinders in conventional engines) is selectively compressed by an ancillary compressor <b>2</b>. The temperature rise at the end of compression can be adjusted by use of air coolers <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, which cool the intake air and by the late cylinder injection of temperature-adjusted air, and alternatively, by using chilled charge air and always with a low compression ratio in Operational Designs 2-6. While operating optionally in mode 1, the valve <b>16</b>-A, which injects a supplementary secondary air-fuel charge in mode 2 and mode 3 can be deactivated and/or compressor <b>2</b> is “waste gated” by bypass valves <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, being opened. (Optionally, high-pressure valve <b>16</b>-A is a simple air or gas injection valve similar to a natural gas fuel injector which is closed during mode 1 operation.)</p>
  <p num="p-0100">Optional operational modes for the engines of this invention assures continued reliable engine operation in mode 1 at such a time that ancillary compressor(s) may fail when operating in mode 2 or mode 3. By cutting out the supercharging air supply section, the engine continues to operate in mode 1 with power equal to conventional engines and with improved fuel economy. (This pertains to Operational Designs 1, 2, 3 and 6 with Design 4 being excepted.) Thus, mode 1 is especially essential for military vehicle or power generation duty.</p>
  <heading>Mode 1</heading> <p num="p-0101">During operation, a primary air charge is supplied by piston <b>22</b> intake (1<sup>st</sup>) stroke to the cylinder <b>7</b> through intake valve <b>16</b>-B at atmospheric pressure or air which has been increased in pressure by perhaps one-half to one atmosphere through an atmospheric air inlet <b>9</b> or through inlet <b>8</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which is preferably carbureted. For mode 1 operation, the charge is then compressed (2<sup>nd </sup>stroke) in the cylinder <b>7</b>, fuel added if not present, and ignited at the appropriate point near TDC for the power (3<sup>rd</sup>) stroke, followed by the scavenging (4<sup>th</sup>) stroke, providing high fuel economy and low polluting emissions. This completes one power cycle.</p>
  <heading>Mode 2</heading> <p num="p-0102">When more power is desired for mode 2 or mode 3 operation, a secondary air charge (mandatory at all times for Design 4), originating from air conduit <b>8</b>′ and high pressure manifold (<b>13</b> and <b>14</b> in FIG. <b>2</b>), is introduced into the power cylinder <b>7</b> by a second intake valve <b>16</b>-A, which introduces a higher pressure temperature adjusted air or air-fuel charge after the first intake valve, <b>16</b>-B has closed. It is then injected either during the intake stroke, or preferably after compression has begun, or at any time during the compression stroke, or near TDC. This is in order to adjust the temperature and increase charge density and turbulence when needed. After the secondary air charge has been injected, intake valve <b>16</b>-A, which can be operated hydraulically or electrically or in some designs by cam, quickly closes. Compression (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke continues and the charge is ignited near TDC. Piston <b>22</b> expands in the power (3<sup>rd</sup>) stroke followed by the scavenging 4<sup>th </sup>stroke. This completes one power cycle.</p>
  <heading>Mode 3 (Steady-State)</heading> <p num="p-0103">For mode 3 operation, modes 1 and 2 are combined, simplifying operation with the high-pressure secondary charge being injected without interruption into cylinder <b>7</b> any time after low-pressure intake valve <b>16</b>-B closes as in mode 1, and preferably injected during the compression stroke. The compression stroke continues to near TDC. The charge is ignited for the power (3<sup>rd</sup>) stroke followed the scavenging (4<sup>th</sup>) stroke. This completes one power cycle in mode 3 operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0104">Alternatively, a one-way valve (one type of which is shown as <b>2</b>′ in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>) can be utilized to provide a constant or a variable initial “pressure ratio” in the cylinder <b>12</b>, while improving turbulence. In this alternate method of operation, valve <b>2</b>′ would close when the pressure in the cylinder <b>12</b> nearly equates or exceeds the pressure in conduit B, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> or conduit <b>15</b>-A in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, isolating valve <b>16</b>-A from cylinders <b>7</b> or <b>12</b> and giving valve <b>16</b>-A adequate time to close. Thus, the pressure in conduit B or <b>15</b>-A, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, controlled by compressor speed, along with valves <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> and the ultimate compression ratio would regulate the pressure, density, temperature and turbulence of the combustion charge.</p>
  <p num="p-0105">The air pressure, supplied to intake runner-conduit <b>15</b>-A (FIG. <b>1</b>), is produced at a high level, and intake valve <b>16</b>-A is, in alternate embodiments, replaced by a fast-acting, more controllable valve, such as, but not limited to a high speed valve (<b>21</b>′, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>7</b> and <b>10</b>), which valve is, preferably, either mechanically, hydraulically, electrically or vacuum operated alternatively under the control of an engine control module (ECM)-<b>27</b>. In such an embodiment, a small or large, dense, temperature-adjusted, high-pressure charge, with or without accompanying fuel, can, selectively, be injected (perhaps by a gas-fuel type injector) at any time during the compression stroke, or even during the combustion process (always after intake valve <b>16</b>-B has closed) in order to adjust the charge temperature and density, to reduce peak and overall combustion temperatures and to complete the desired charge mixing before combustion.</p>
  <p num="p-0106">Alternatively, conduit <b>15</b>-A, FIG. <b>1</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may be fitted with compression-expansion valves <b>10</b>′ as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-B</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-D</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11-B</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18-B</figref> to maximize the cooling abilities of the high pressure charge going to intake valve <b>16</b>-A, or in one design, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>, the chilled charge is primary and is injected by intake valve <b>16</b>-B. (Preferably when the air charge is injected by expansion valve <b>10</b>′, the injection takes place during the intake stroke as in FIG. <b>2</b>-C). Also, the expansion valve <b>10</b>′ can be made variable in size, and/or bypass system R and X (adjustable by ECM-<b>27</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-B</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-D</figref>) in order to control the cooling and power characteristics of the injected charge, as needed.</p>
  <p num="p-0107">In order to maximize the chill cooling effect, the differential pressure of the cylinder and the incoming charge must be significantly in favor of the incoming charge with the cylinder pressure being the lower.</p>
  <p num="p-0108">Alternatively, inlet ducts <b>17</b>-A or <b>17</b>-B of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>7</b> and <b>10</b> are placed in the cylinder wall so that part of the high-pressure charge air is injected between cylinder wall <b>7</b> and piston <b>22</b>, preferably above the top piston ring at TDC. This will provide cooling for the engine and sweep the area clean of unburned hydrocarbons and also prevent the formation of formaldehyde</p>
  <p num="p-0109">High pressure inlet conduits <b>15</b>-A in the engines of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, FIG. <b>3</b> and FIG. <b>4</b> and high pressure conduits B in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, and conduit <b>9</b>′ in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11-B</figref> and conduit <b>8</b>′ in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, conduits <b>15</b> <i>a</i>-A, <b>15</b> <i>f</i>-A to valve <b>16</b> <i>a</i>-E and <b>16</b> <i>f</i>-E of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, and conduit <b>8</b>′ in FIG. <b>19</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19-B</figref>, in alternative designs are fitted with adjustable expansion valves <b>10</b>′ as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-B</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-D</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11-B</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18-B</figref> to refrigerate the high pressure air going to the high pressure intake valves <b>16</b>-A, and in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>, refrigerate the air going to the low pressure intake valve <b>16</b>-B. The latter chills the primary charge air for further improvements in reducing polluting emissions.</p>
  <p num="p-0110">Alternatively, in the engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>, the air or air/fuel (primary) charge first entering the cylinder <b>7</b> or <b>12</b> by intake valve <b>16</b>-B or ports <b>11</b> is compressed highly and passed through expansion valve <b>10</b>′, pressure-drop-distributor, <b>11</b>′ and distributor tube (evaporator) <b>17</b> <i>a</i>, at the beginning of the intake of valve <b>16</b>-B, which is then closed at BDC for Operational Designs 1 and 2 in which cam profiles are as normal. The intake valve <b>16</b>-B can close early or late in other designs in regard to the effective compression ratio desired. In this case, when greater power is needed (mode 2 or 3), the cool high pressure air or air/fuel charge is injected by intake valve <b>16</b>-A at any time during the compression stroke, or even during combustion, after intake valve <b>16</b>-B has closed in any case.</p>
  <p num="p-0111">The expansion valves <b>10</b>′ can alternatively have variable size openings and bypass systems R and X. They are controlled by the ECM-<b>27</b> to maintain optimum engine temperature and density in regards to polluting emissions and power requirements. Alternatively, the expansion valves may be combined with high-speed cylinder intake valves into one unit.</p>
  <p num="p-0112">If the charge air entering expansion valve <b>10</b>′ of engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref> was at 200 psi pressure, and the expansion valve <b>10</b>′ dropped the pressure going to cylinder 7 to 70 psi, the chilling effect will be high and the pressure boost will be about five atmospheres for great power. If the primary air charge was compressed to 100 psi, it could be expanded by valve <b>10</b>′ to say 15 psig for adequate cooling with a pressure boost of one atmosphere.</p>
  <p num="p-0113">Fuel can be carbureted in any of the 4-stroke designs in one or both air inlet streams, with the exception of Design 4 of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-B</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18-B</figref> where carburetion of fuel must of necessity be done in the high-pressure incoming stream only. Also, the 2-stroke designs should be carbureted by the high pressure inlet air stream only.</p>
  <p num="p-0114">Fuel can also be injected in a central-body (not shown), or the fuel can be injected into one or both of the inlet streams of air, injected into a pre-combustion or pre-heater chamber, or injected directly through intake valves <b>16</b>-A, <b>16</b>-B (<b>16</b>-B only if <b>16</b>-B does not remain open past BDC and not at all in Design 4), or it may be injected directly into the combustion chamber at point x during the compression stroke (and during the intake stroke, only if intake valve <b>16</b>-B closes before or at BDC), or at the time after the piston <b>22</b> has reached point x in the compression stroke. The fuel can be injected along with compressed air, compressed cooled air, or with compression-expansion “chilled” accompanying air, the latter as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-B</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-D</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11-B</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18-B</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18-C</figref>. The fuel can be injected with or without heated or cool accompanying air. In the case of diesel operation, fuel can be carbureted for spark ignition or for the HCCI system, as explained herein.</p>
  <p num="p-0115">Alternatively, for modified or true HCCI operation of diesel fueled engines, the fuel can be carbureted, if during compression of the charge, the temperature is kept below the auto-ignition temperature of the fuel-air mixture. Compressing in stages with intercooling makes this system feasible. The air-fuel mixture is kept just below auto-ignition temperatures. The fuel can also be carbureted with the air charge before or after any stage of compression and cooling of charge. In either of these two systems, the charge can be ignited by spark or HCCI at near piston TDC. As an alternative to initial fuel carburetion, the primary air only charge can be compressed to temperatures higher than auto-ignition temperature. A small secondary air charge is then cooled and mixed (carburated) with the entire fuel charge and is injected 10-15 degrees before or at piston TDC for timely ignition. In either of these systems, the high-pressure secondary charge injection will assure homogenization and clean burning of the charge. After the temperature-and density-adjusting-air charge has been injected (mode 2 or 3), compression of the charge continues and with fuel present, is ignited at the opportune time, preferably 10-15° before TDC, for the expansion (3<sup>rd</sup>) stroke. The effective compression ratio is established by the displaced volume of the cylinder remaining after point x (the point where intake valve <b>16</b>-B closed whether before, at, or after BDC) has been reached on the compression stroke, being divided by the volume of the combustion chamber. Therefore, the compression ratio for Designs 1 and 2 is equal to the compression ratio, and for Design 4, it is zero. The expansion ratio is determined by dividing the cylinders total clearance volume by the volume of the combustion chamber.</p>
  <p num="p-0116">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-C</figref>, in engines having only one atmospheric intake conduit, but having different air paths and conduits, such as conduits <b>15</b>-A and <b>15</b>-C of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a shunt conduit <b>202</b>′ leading from the exhaust conduit <b>18</b> is divided into two shunt conduit portions <b>203</b> <i>a</i>, <b>203</b> <i>b</i>, each with a proportioning valve <b>209</b> <i>a</i>, <b>209</b> <i>b </i>operating so as to selectively admit exhausted gases to either or both of intake valve <b>16</b>-B (through conduit <b>9</b> and eventually conduit <b>15</b>-C) and/or to intake valve <b>16</b>-A (by way of conduit <b>8</b> and conduit <b>1</b>S-A). Each proportioning valve, <b>209</b> <i>a</i>, <b>209</b> <i>b </i>would allow either a portion or none of the exhausted gases to enter its respective port, meanwhile restricting entrance of fresh air if necessary. The exhausted gases can be cooled or heated by optionally arranging fins <b>202</b> <i>a </i>on conduit <b>202</b>′ and/or <b>203</b> <i>a</i>, <b>203</b> <i>b </i>and <b>203</b> <i>c</i>, or by passing the exhaust through an optional intercooler or heater (not shown) before the gases are introduced into the air intake(s) of the engine. A take-off shunt conduit <b>203</b> <i>d </i>and a proportioning valve <b>209</b> <i>e </i>leading from shunt <b>202</b>, which is filled with exhaust gases, along with shunt <b>203</b> <i>e </i>and proportioning valve <b>209</b> <i>f</i>, leading from atmospheric air intake conduit <b>9</b>, with shunt conduit <b>203</b> <i>d </i>and shunt <b>203</b> <i>e </i>converging and becoming a single shunt conduit <b>203</b> <i>f</i>, leading to a compressor <b>2</b>′, which has a conduit <b>203</b> <i>g </i>leading to a bypass system <b>209</b> <i>g</i>, <b>203</b> <i>h </i>and an intercooler or heat exchanger <b>108</b>, which has a conduit <b>203</b> <i>i</i>, leading to an outlet conduit <b>36</b>, which is connected to a preparation or pre-combustion chamber <b>38</b>′ shown in FIG. <b>19</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19-B</figref> in combustion chamber of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19-C</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19-D</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0117">With this arrangement, proportioning valves can direct undiluted exhaust gases or fresh air or any percentage of either, mixed through compressor <b>2</b> and optional cooler or heat exchanger <b>108</b> to inlet <b>36</b> of FIG. <b>19</b> and inlet <b>36</b>-B of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19-B</figref> for the purpose of being used as a catalyst for ignition of the air-fuel charge in pre-combustion chamber <b>38</b>′ or combustion chamber <b>38</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0118">Alternatively, as shown in phantom on <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-C</figref>, one shunt portion <b>203</b> <i>a </i>is optionally diverted (shown as <b>203</b> <i>c</i>) directly to conduit <b>15</b>-C and provided there with a proportioning valve <b>209</b> <i>c. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0119">In the engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> having dual atmospheric air intakes <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, (<b>9</b> is in phantom) an arrangement similar to that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-C</figref> is utilized, it being understood, however, that conduit <b>8</b> is open to the atmosphere.</p>
  <p num="p-0120">In any engines having dual air intake conduits or dual air paths, a portion of exhausted gases can be introduced in any amount necessary, from one to three points and controlled preferably by an engine control module (ECM) for better management of combustion and emissions characteristics.</p>
  <heading>The Engine <b>100</b> <sup>2 </sup>of FIG. <b>2</b> Operating in Operational Designs 1-6</heading> <p num="p-0121">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is shown a schematic drawing of a six-cylinder engine <b>100</b> <sup>2 </sup>operating optionally in three modes in a 4-stroke cycle.

  <heading>Mode 2</heading> <p num="p-0123">The intake (1<sup>st</sup>) stroke has occurred and for more power for mode 2 or 3 operation, high-pressure, cooled air is injected through intake valve <b>16</b>-A at anytime after piston <b>22</b> reaches BDC on intake stroke, preferably during the compression stroke for Operational Designs 1 and 2 of FIG. <b>1</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> engine, and for Designs 3 (both methods), Designs 5 and 6, after piston <b>22</b> has reached point x during the compression stroke (the point in which intake valve <b>16</b>-B closes), and near TDC for Design 4. Alternatively, for Designs 3 (both methods) and Designs 5 and 6, intake valve <b>16</b>-A is opened at any point deemed appropriate in the intake stroke or compression stroke at or after the point at which intake valve <b>16</b>-B closes. Intake valve <b>16</b>-A then quickly closes, compression continues in Designs 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 and fuel is added, if not present. The charge is ignited near (TDC) and the power (3<sup>rd</sup>) stroke occurs in all Design systems including Design 4 where the entire charge is introduced pre-compressed, near TDC of stroke <b>2</b> and ignited for the power (3<sup>rd</sup>) stroke, which is followed by the scavenging (4<sup>th</sup>) stroke.</p>
  <heading>Mode 3 (Steady-State)</heading> <p num="p-0124">Operational modes 1 and 2 are combined in this manner for a more simple operation: Piston <b>22</b> takes in air or air-fuel charge on the intake (1<sup>st</sup>) stroke according to the Operational Design chosen. A secondary high pressure air charge is injected by intake valve <b>16</b>-A preferably during the compression stroke, either later or at the same time that the piston <b>22</b> reaches the point at which the intake valve <b>16</b>-B closes. Intake valve <b>16</b>-A then quickly closes, compression continues, with the exception Design 4, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, where piston <b>22</b> is near TDC when valve <b>16</b>-B closes and the high-pressure valve <b>16</b>-A charges the cylinder.

  <p num="p-0125">In all operational modes, a third alternate and preferred air induction system shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> supplies the primary air charge to intake valve <b>16</b>-B as follows: Charge-air which has been pressurized to a low pressure by compressor <b>1</b>, perhaps from 0.3 Bar to as much as 2 Bar or more, can selectively (and intermittently or continuously) be supplied to low pressure intake valves <b>16</b>-B of the engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by way of conduit <b>32</b>, leading from conduit <b>110</b> to the intake valves (<b>16</b> <i>a</i>-B through <b>16</b> <i>f</i>-B) which conduit receives charge-air at atmospheric pressure or which has been pressurized and has had its temperature optimized, all controlled by compressor <b>1</b> and intercooler <b>10</b> with the charge-air paths being controlled by ECM-<b>27</b> and valves <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> with the corresponding conduits. In this case the valve <b>33</b> is optional. The use of this system also eliminates the need for dual atmospheric air intakes.</p>
  <p num="p-0126">A fourth alternate air induction system, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, supplies the primary charge-air to the low pressure intake valves <b>16</b>-B by having charge-air coming selectively from intake system <b>9</b>, manifold <b>14</b>-B and intake runners <b>15</b>-C (shown in phantom) or from conduit <b>32</b>, which would direct air to power cylinder <b>7</b> at whatever level of pressure and temperature was needed at any particular time. With this arrangement, opening valve <b>33</b> at such a time that compressor <b>1</b> was compressing the charge passing through it, would have the effect of increasing the density of the primary charge-air, which in this case, has its temperature as well as its pressure adjusted by compressor <b>1</b> and control valves <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>. A one-way valve <b>34</b> would prevent the higher pressure air escaping through conduit <b>15</b>-C. When less power was needed, compressor <b>1</b> could be “waste gated” by opening, partially or completely, control valve <b>6</b> and closing shutter valve <b>5</b>. Alternatively, valve <b>33</b> could be closed by the engine control module (ECM-<b>27</b>) and the primary charge-air would be drawn into cylinder <b>7</b> at atmospheric pressure through intake duct <b>9</b>.</p>

  <p num="p-0128">Depending upon the power requirements of the engine (e.g., differing load requirements), either intake air at atmospheric pressure from inlet <b>9</b> or intake air that has been boosted in pressure by compressor <b>1</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, by conduit <b>32</b> and has had its temperature adjusted by bypass systems <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> and charge-air cooler <b>10</b>, is drawn into the cylinder <b>7</b> by intake stroke through air inlet <b>8</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or <b>2</b>-B, the atmospheric air optionally through manifold <b>14</b>-B, intake conduits <b>15</b>-B, and either at atmospheric pressure or boosted, is received by intake valves <b>16</b> <i>a</i>-B-<b>16</b> <i>f</i>-B, by intake stroke of piston <b>22</b>.

  <p num="p-0129">Operational Design 1. In this design, intake valving and combustion chambers are as in normal engines. On the primary air intake (1<sup>st</sup>) stroke, the intake valve is left open as normally done to receive as large a charge as possible and closed at the usual time, near (BDC) to capture a full air charge, which produces a normal compression ratio with the expansion ratio being equal to the compression ratio.</p>
  <p num="p-0130">Operational Design 2. In Design 2, the primary air intake valving is as in normal engines to capture a full air charge, but the combustion chamber is larger-than-normal for a substandard compression ratio still with the expansion ratio being equal to the compression ratio.</p>
  <p num="p-0131">Operational Design 3. There are two methods to this design. In the first method for the primary air intake, the intake valve <b>16</b>-B is closed early, during the intake stroke before the piston reaches BDC. The small trapped air charge provides a substandard or low effective compression ratio with the expansion ratio being greater than the compression ratio.</p>
  <p num="p-0132">In the optional method of Design 3 of primary air charging after the intake stroke is complete, the intake valve <b>16</b>-B, which can be single or multiple, is left open for a period of time after the piston <b>22</b> has passed BDC and is then closed. This pumps part of the fresh air charge back into the intake manifold to again trap a smaller-than-normal air charge producing a substandard or low effective compression ratio with an extended expansion ratio.</p>
  <p num="p-0133">Operational Design 4. Design 4 describes another system of primary air charging, which is to hold the intake valve <b>16</b>-B open on the intake (1<sup>st</sup>) stroke, through BDC to near piston (TDC). Valve <b>16</b>-B is then closed to trap very little primary air charge for an effective compression ratio of perhaps 2:1 or less with an extended expansion ratio. Optionally, intake valve <b>16</b>-B is closed at piston BDC and an ancillary valve (not shown) is opened to allow the primary air charge to be pumped through and out of the cylinder for cooling of the cylinder.</p>
  <p num="p-0134">Operational Design 5. Design 5 describes an additional method of primary air charging an engine cylinder <b>7</b>, of engines of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-B</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, FIG. <b>5</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> with a smaller-than-normal charge is being captured in cylinder <b>7</b>, by intake valve <b>16</b>-B closing early in the intake stroke at piston BDC, or early in the compression stroke, optionally producing a substandard or normal compression ratio which alternatively produces an extended or a normal expansion ratio.</p>
  <p num="p-0135">Operational Design 6. Design 6 describes still another alternative method of primary air or air-fuel-charging. In this system, valve <b>16</b>-B selectively closes early before BDC, or as late as BDC of piston <b>22</b>, optionally producing a substandard or normal compression ratio for optionally a variable expansion ratio.</p>
  <heading>General Operation of Operational Designs 1 Through 6</heading> <heading>Mode 1</heading> <p num="p-0136">The intake (1<sup>st</sup>) stroke has occurred and the compression (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke is now underway. Compression begins for a normal compression ratio in Design 1, and for a substandard compression ratio in Design 2, a substandard compression ratio for Design 3 and for a compression ratio of near zero in Design 4. Designs 5 and 6 can produce a normal compression ratio or a substandard compression ratio depending on the point that intake valve <b>16</b>-B closes. If the effective compression ratio is substandard in Operational Designs 3 through 6, the expansion ratio is extended.</p>
  <p num="p-0137">With the substandard compression ratio of Design 2 and with the intake valve <b>16</b>-B closing early or late in Designs 3 and 4 and alternatively early or late in Designs 5 and 6, lessens the temperature rise of the primary air charge during the compression stroke. In Design 4, there is little or no heat-of-compression, only the cooling of the cylinder by the ejected primary air. At the end of the compressions (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke fuel is added, if not present, the charge is ignited near TDC. Then, the expansion (3<sup>rd</sup>) stroke occurs, followed by the scavenging (4<sup>th</sup>) stroke. This produces an efficient low emissions operation with normal power, especially if the primary air is boosted in pressure.</p>
  <heading>Mode 2</heading> <p num="p-0138">Intake valve <b>16</b>-B has opened and closed for the induction of the primary air charge by piston <b>22</b> intake (1<sup>st</sup>) stroke. A secondary compressed, temperature-adjusted air charge is injected into the cylinder <b>7</b> by intake valve <b>16</b>-A, which opens and closes quickly after closure of valve <b>16</b>-B. This preferably happens during the compression stroke, or even during combustion in all Operational Designs. In all operational designs, the intake valve <b>16</b>-A will open only at or after reaching the point the intake valve <b>16</b>-B closes in the primary air charging process, which for Design 4 is near TDC, to inject the secondary air charge. In all cases, the engine of this invention can produce a more dense, homogenized temperature controlled charge in order to provide the torque and power desired of the engine. The later in the compression stroke the secondary air or air-fuel charge is injected, the less is the heat-of-compression for that portion of air also. This fact, coupled with the low heat-of-compression production of the first or primary air or air-fuel charge, assures a very cool compression process in total.</p>
  <p num="p-0139">For Operational Design 4, the secondary charge produces virtually no heat-of-compression for the coolest working cycle of all Designs.</p>
  <heading>Mode 3 (Steady-State)</heading> <p num="p-0140">The engines of the present invention can be simply and efficiently operated in a single mode, mode 3, by combining the operations of mode 1 and mode 2, whereby the secondary air or air-fuel of mode 2 is added in mode 3 without interruption at the same point it would be injected in mode 2, according to the Operational Design of 1 through 6 that is chosen for the particular engine design and duty cycle selected.</p>
  <heading>Discussion of Various Operating Parameters</heading> <p num="p-0141">In Design 4, after inducting the primary air charge by the intake (1<sup>st</sup>) stroke of piston <b>22</b>, little air charge is retained on the compression stroke and cylinder <b>7</b> is empty, or almost so and near TDC as intake valve <b>16</b>-B closes after ejecting almost all of its fresh air charge back into the intake system. Close to the end of the 2<sup>nd </sup>stroke and near TDC high pressure “conditioned” air intake valve <b>16</b>-A opens to inject nearly, or virtually all of the required air or air/fuel charge. (In this system, the primary air charge is pumped in and out of the cylinder, mostly to cool cylinder <b>7</b> before the “loading” and firing at TDC for the power (3<sup>rd</sup>) stroke of piston <b>22</b>. Alternatively, an ancillary exhaust valve <b>16</b>-C (indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-B</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>, but not shown) or exhaust valve <b>17</b> would be opened at the beginning of compression (2<sup>nd</sup>)stroke of piston <b>22</b> and closed near piston TDC rather than keeping intake valve <b>16</b>-B open to near end of compression stroke. This is in order to vent the unused air of the non-compressing (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke to the exhaust manifold, to be used to cool compressor or engine cylinders or expelled to the atmosphere or for other use.) As soon as the air charge is injected near TDC, fuel is added, if not present. The charge is ignited for a very cool, dense combustion expansion process in the expansion (3<sup>rd</sup>) stroke followed by the scavenging (4<sup>th</sup>) stroke. This completes one power cycle. In this Operational Design, the fuel charge is injected near piston TDC, but early enough that the charge can be placed, the valve <b>16</b>-B closed and the charge ignited, the latter preferably 10-15 degrees BTDC.</p>
  <p num="p-0142">For Design 4, among the various choices available, the engine of either <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-B</figref> or <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref> could be utilized, offering a choice of thermodynamically chilling either the primary air charge, which only cools the cylinder, or chilling the secondary air charge or chilling both charges with the primary air charge being used to cool the cylinder <b>7</b> and its combustion chamber with the secondary charge being a chilled working charge. The primary charge is expelled either back through intake valve <b>16</b>-B or through an ancillary valve <b>16</b>-C (not shown) or through exhaust valve <b>17</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> which is again opened at BDC and left open to near TDC.</p>
  <p num="p-0143">Operating in mode 2 or steady-state mode 3 when even greater power is required using either of the Operational Designs, the secondary air charge can be increased in density and weight by causing shutter valves <b>5</b> and <b>3</b> and by-pass valves <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> to direct all or a greater part of the air charge through compressors <b>2</b> and <b>1</b> and through coolers <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> to increase the charge density and/or by increasing compressor speed or by cutting in a third stage of auxiliary compression, thus enabling more air to be pumped in on the backside. Alternatively, the secondary air or air-fuel charge can be compression-expansion chilled by the system shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-B</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11-B</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18-B</figref> and items <b>10</b>′, <b>11</b>″, <b>12</b>, <b>17</b> <i>a</i>, <b>27</b>′<i>a</i>, <b>27</b>′<i>f </i>and <b>16</b> <i>a</i>-A and <b>16</b> <i>f</i>-A. In the engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>, the primary air charge through intake valve <b>16</b>-B is compression-expansion chilled with intake valve <b>16</b>-A, when operating in mode 2 or mode 3, receiving the dense, non-expanded air charge as in engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>. The timing of the closing of intake valve <b>16</b>-B can be optionally altered in Designs 3, 4, 5 or 6, perhaps temporarily, to retain a smaller, or a larger charge.</p>
  <p num="p-0144">In all Designs for modes 1, 2 and steady-state mode 3, near the end of the compression stroke, fuel is added, if not present, the charge is ignited by spark, compression, modified HCCI or by HCCI, and combustion produces a large expansion of the combusted gases against the piston <b>22</b> for the power (3<sup>rd</sup>) stroke producing great energy in either mode 1, mode 2 or mode 3 for Designs 1, 2, 3, 5 or 6 (Design 4 operates only in mode 3). This energy is absorbed and turned into high torque and power.</p>
  <p num="p-0145">Near piston BDC, for modes 1, 2 and 3, the exhaust valves <b>17</b> <i>a</i>-<b>17</b> <i>f</i>, <b>17</b> <i>a</i>′-<b>17</b> <i>f</i>′ open and the cylinder <b>7</b> is efficiently scavenged by the (4<sup>th</sup>) stroke of piston <b>22</b>, after which valve(s) <b>17</b> close (seen in FIG. <b>1</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0146">Shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a suggested engine control system consisting of an engine control module (ECM) <b>27</b>, two shutter valves <b>3</b> and <b>5</b>, two air bypass valves <b>4</b> and <b>6</b>, the optional pressure reducing valves <b>25</b> (<b>25</b> <i>a</i>-<b>25</b> <i>f</i>) on air conduits <b>15</b>-B (<b>15</b> <i>a</i>-B-<b>15</b> <i>f</i>-B) There is also a scheme of controlling the pressure, temperature and density separately by controlling air bypass valves <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> and shutter valves <b>3</b> and <b>5</b>. As illustrated, air bypass valve <b>4</b> is closed to allow compressor <b>2</b> to fully compress the charge and shutter valve <b>3</b> is slightly open, allowing part of the air to flow uncooled (hollow arrows) and some of the air cooled (solid arrows) to the manifolds <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>, all of which could be controlled by the ECM-<b>27</b> in order to provide an air charge at optimum density, temperature and pressure. The hollow arrow <b>4</b>-A in conduit <b>120</b> shows how ABV <b>4</b> can be partially opened to allow some of the air to bypass and return to compressor <b>2</b> in order to finely adjust the pressure of the secondary air charge that is injected during mode 2 operation to adjust the charge density, turbulence and temperature. Part or all of the air charge can be directed through the intercoolers <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> (except that going through conduit <b>32</b> to intercooler <b>10</b> on the way to intake valve <b>16</b>-B) or through bypass conduits <b>121</b> and <b>122</b>, to the manifolds <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>. In addition, the temperature and density in cylinder(s) <b>7</b> can be controlled over a greater range by utilizing the compression-expansion charge chilling feature depicted and described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-B</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-D</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11-B</figref> and <b>18</b>-B, with the expansion valve opening size and the bypass system alternatively, also being controlled preferably by ECM-<b>27</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0147">In any of the engines of this invention, the problem common to normal engines of incomplete mixing of fuel, air and residual gas, with consequent variation in conditions at the ignition point is minimized and, in some cases, eliminated by the turbulent air charge injection at high pressure and/or by carburetion of fuel-air. This problem, hereby addressed by the present invention, is extreme in current engines when gaseous fuel is injected directly into the cylinder where the spark may occur in mixtures of varying air-fuel ratios, hence with various rates of flame development.</p>
  <p num="p-0148">The turbulence produced in mode 2 and steady-state mode 3 by high pressure charge injection during the compression stroke, or later, is not dampened by the compression stroke. In Operational Design 2 through 6, the subnormal compression ratios lessen the heat-of-compression for the first portion of air charge. The later the supplementary, secondary charge is injected, the smaller the volume of charge is required to produce the desired turbulence and less the heat-of-compression development for that portion of charge, also. In any reciprocating internal combustion engine, operating in accordance with the method of the present invention, a very high pressure, temperature-controlled air charge can, selectively, be injected very late in the compression stroke, (and in Operational Design 4 for FIG. <b>1</b>-<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> engines, the charge is injected in just far enough before TDC to allow proper charging and ignition.</p>
  <p num="p-0149">The use of this system will result in lower maximum cylinder pressures and temperatures. Efficiency should be greater and the detonation limit higher, thus allowing an appreciable increase in efficiency and mean effective cylinder pressure with a given fuel. All of the engines of this invention can, with the exception of Operational Designs 1 and 2, operate with a more complete expansion process, as compared to the typical prior art engines, to provide even further improvements in efficiency and emissions characteristics. In Designs 1 and 2, the compression and expansion ratios are equal.</p>
  <p num="p-0150">The fuel can be injected with part, or all, of the air charge in either mode 1, 2 or 3 with the exception of Design 4 which operates only in mode 3. The fuel can also be injected later and, in the case of conventional diesel operation, can be injected into the combustion chamber at the usual point for diesel oil injection, perhaps into a pre-combustion chamber or directly onto a glow plug. In mode 2 or 3, after the temperature-and-density-adjusting-air charge has been injected, if used, compression of the charge continues except, in Design 4 of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> engine, where piston is near TDC, and with fuel present, is ignited at the opportune time for the expansion stroke. Now, in all modes, the air-fuel charge has been ignited and the power stroke of piston <b>22</b> takes place as the combusted gases expand. Near BDC of the power stroke, the exhaust valve(s) <b>17</b> opens and the cylinder <b>7</b> is efficiently scavenged by piston stroke <b>4</b>. If Design 4 of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> engine is utilized, an outlet valve <b>16</b>-C (not shown) or exhaust valve <b>17</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> expels almost the entire primary charge, using it only to cool cylinder <b>7</b>, with a heavier secondary air charge being injected into cylinder <b>7</b> by valve <b>16</b>-A and ignited at or near TDC. Alternatively, intake valve <b>16</b>-B may be left open through most of the compression stroke for Design 4 in order to express the primary charge back through valve <b>16</b>-B.</p>
  <heading>The Engine <b>100</b> <sup>2-B </sup>of FIG. <b>2</b>-B Operating in Operational Designs 1-6</heading> <p num="p-0151">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-B</figref>, there is shown a six cylinder reciprocating internal combustion engine <b>100</b> <sup>2-B </sup>having one atmospheric air intake <b>9</b> and is so constructed and arranged that a compressor <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> receives charge air from manifold <b>14</b>-B through openings <b>8</b>-B (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and conduit <b>8</b>′ which air enters through common air intake duct <b>9</b> or by way of inlet port <b>8</b>. Intake conduits <b>15</b> <i>a</i>-C to <b>15</b> <i>f</i>-C or <b>32</b>, the latter optionally boosted in pressure, distributes the low pressure air to the intake valves <b>16</b>-B of each power cylinder. This arrangement allows the provision of air to intake valves <b>16</b>-A and <b>16</b>-B at different pressure levels since the charge air from conduit <b>27</b> <i>a</i>-<b>27</b> <i>f </i>are selectively pressurized by compressor <b>2</b> and alternatively, by compressor <b>1</b> which also receives the total air charge through intake duct <b>8</b>. Intake conduits <b>27</b> <i>a</i>-<b>27</b> <i>f </i>and <b>15</b> <i>f</i>-C, in which all of the cylinders (only two (<b>7</b>) of which are shown in a sectional view) <b>7</b> <i>a</i>-<b>7</b> <i>f </i>and associated pistons <b>22</b> <i>a</i>-<b>22</b> <i>f </i>operate in a 4-stroke cycle and all power cylinders are used for producing power to a common crankshaft <b>20</b> via connecting rods <b>19</b> <i>a</i>-<b>19</b> <i>f</i>, respectively. A compressor <b>2</b>, in this figure, a Lysholm type rotary compressor, is shown, which with air conduits, as shown, selectively supplies pressurized air to one or more cylinder intake valves <b>16</b>-A. An air inlet conduit <b>8</b>′ receives atmospheric air from a low-pressure manifold <b>14</b>-B, which receives atmospheric air through inlet <b>9</b>. Inlet conduits <b>15</b>-C, <b>27</b> <i>a</i>-<b>27</b> <i>f </i>or <b>32</b> separately supply air charge at atmospheric pressure, or optionally boosted slightly if by conduit <b>32</b>, and air which has been compressed to a higher pressure to separate intake valves <b>16</b>-A (high pressure) and <b>16</b>-B (low pressure) opening to the same cylinder (shown here opening to cylinder <b>7</b> <i>a </i>and <b>7</b> <i>f</i>).

Engines operating in Operational Designs 1 and 2 have compression and expansion ratios that are equal, although Design 2 has a substandard compression ratio set by an oversized combustion chamber.

  <p num="p-0158">The engine <b>100</b> <sup>2-C </sup>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref> is characterized by the ability to provide equal compression and expansion ratios in Operational Designs 1 or 2 and an extended expansion ratio and a low “effective” compression ratio in Designs 3, 4, 5 and 6, all capable of producing a combustion charge varying in weight from substandard to heavier-than-normal and capable of selectively providing a mean effective cylinder pressure (MEP) higher than can the conventional arrangement in normal engines with lower maximum cylinder temperature in comparison to conventional engines.

As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>, the low pressure primary charge air, or air-fuel mix to intake valve <b>16</b>-B, is expansion chilled by conduits <b>114</b> and <b>113</b>, receiving highly compressed and cooled air, compressed by one or several stages of compression with intercooling and conveying the cool dense air or air-fuel charge to expansion valves <b>10</b>′ and <b>10</b>″, pressure-drop-distributors <b>11</b>′ and <b>11</b>″.

  <p num="p-0159">The air or air-fuel charge can be composed of air and such fuels as gasoline, alcohols, diesel oils, diethyl ether, propane, natural gas, hydrogen, etc. Due to its high density charge potential and low operating temperature, the Entec Cycle Engine becomes the best reciprocating engine for hydrogen fuel operation and for HCCI operation, the only engine for diesel fuel.</p>
  <heading>Brief Description of Operation of the Engine <b>100</b> <sup>2-C </sup>Shown in FIG. <b>2</b>-C</heading> <p num="p-0160">The new cycle engine <b>100</b> <sup>2-C </sup>of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref> is a high efficiency engine that attains both high power and torque, with low fuel consumption and low polluting emissions. In this cycle, the intake air is selectively compressed by ancillary compressor <b>2</b> and alternatively also by compressor <b>1</b>. The temperature rise at the end of compression stroke is restrained by a substandard compression ratio in all designs except Operational Design <b>1</b> (see engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and by use of air coolers <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, which cool the intake air and optionally by using chilled primary charge air and selectively by the late cylinder injection during the compression stroke of cool, temperature-adjusted, dense supplementary, secondary air charge.</p>
  <heading>Operation</heading> <p num="p-0161">The entire air charge is received through inlet port <b>8</b> leading to compressor <b>1</b>. The air is compressed, cooled and directed to compressor <b>2</b> where it is further compressed and has the charge temperature adjusted by intercoolers and bypass system and the high pressure charge is conveyed to conduits <b>113</b> and <b>114</b>. The charge is then divided and one part conveyed through expansion chillers (items <b>10</b>′, <b>11</b>′, <b>17</b> <i>a </i>and optionally, R and X) to primary air intake valve <b>16</b>-B while another portion of charge is conveyed to secondary intake valve <b>16</b>-A optionally, without any expansion of charge, but alternatively, with the pressure regulated by regulators D and E on high pressure conduits <b>114</b>′ and <b>113</b>′.</p>
  <heading>Mode 1</heading> <p num="p-0162">During operation, a primary air charge is supplied during the intake (1<sup>st</sup>) stroke to the cylinder <b>7</b> through intake valve <b>16</b>-B, which air or air/fuel has been highly compressed, cooled and expanded through expansion valve <b>10</b>′, pressure-drop-distributor <b>11</b>′ and distributor tube <b>17</b> <i>a</i>, and conduits <b>27</b>′<i>a </i>and which is preferably mixed with fuel and carbureted. During the intake stroke, intake valve <b>16</b>-B closes, specified for either Operational Design 1, 2, 3 or 4, as described for engine of FIG. <b>2</b>. At BDC of piston <b>22</b>, intake valve <b>16</b>-B closes, or is already closed, and the charge is then compressed in the cylinder <b>7</b> by piston (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke. Fuel is added, if not present, and ignited at the appropriate point near piston TDC for the power (3<sup>rd</sup>) stroke, the piston expanding to BDC, after which the exhaust (4<sup>th</sup>) stroke occurs. (The charge density can be from subnormal to as much as 6-7 atmospheres pressure with some designs having an extended expansion ratio, according to the Operational Design selected. All Designs provide high fuel economy and low polluting emissions.) This completes one power cycle in mode 1 and the piston now turns around to begin another cycle. The engine performs with power and low fuel consumption and emissions in this operation mode. The chilled air or air-fuel charge plus the substandard compression ratio of all Operational Designs, except Design 1, assures very low heat-of-compression for this first portion of charge.</p>
  <heading>Mode 2</heading> <p num="p-0163">The intake valve <b>16</b>-B has opened and closed on the intake (1<sup>st</sup>) stroke, according to the Operational Design chosen, receiving a chilled primary charge. The piston <b>22</b> turns around and begins the power stroke, a secondary (non-expanded) high pressure, dense, cool temperature-adjusted air charge originating from air conduits <b>113</b> and <b>114</b>, by way of conduits <b>113</b>′ and <b>114</b>′, from just below B and C, is introduced, optionally pressure regulated, into the power cylinder <b>7</b>. This occurs preferably during the compression (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke of piston <b>22</b>, even as late as near TDC, by a second intake valve <b>16</b>-A. This intake valve introduces the cool, high pressure supplementary air charge, at any time after the first intake valve <b>16</b>-B has closed in order to adjust the temperature and to increase charge density and turbulence of the charge. After the supplementary air charge has been injected, intake valve <b>16</b>-A, which can be operated hydraulically or electrically or, in some designs, by cam, quickly closes and the compression (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke continues. (The temperature, pressure, amount and point of injection of the supplementary charge, after piston <b>22</b> begins the compression stroke, is adjusted to produce the desired results. The later the secondary charge is injected, the lower will be the compression ratio and the heat-of-compression for that portion of the charge also.)</p>
  <p num="p-0164">Near the end of the compression (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke, fuel is added if not present, the charge is ignited by spark, compression, modified HCCI or HCCI, and combustion produces a large expansion of the combusted gases against the piston <b>22</b> for the power (3<sup>rd</sup>) stroke, producing great energy in any of the Operational Designs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. This energy is absorbed and turned into high torque and power.</p>
  <p num="p-0165">Near BDC of the piston, exhaust valves <b>17</b> <i>a</i>-<b>17</b> <i>f</i>, <b>17</b> <i>a</i>′-<b>17</b> <i>f </i>(see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) open and the cylinder <b>7</b> is efficiently scavenged by the (4<sup>th</sup>) stroke of piston <b>22</b>, after which valve(s) <b>17</b> close, completing a power cycle.</p>
  <p num="p-0166">The air pressure supplied to intake runner-conduit <b>113</b>′-<b>114</b>′, running between conduits <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> and intake valves <b>16</b> <i>a</i>-A and <b>16</b> <i>f</i>-A (FIG. <b>2</b>-C), is produced at a high level. Not being expanded, as is the primary charge, it remains very dense and cool and may alternatively be pressure regulated. In alternate embodiments, intake valve <b>16</b>-A is replaced by a fast-acting, more controllable valve such as, but not limited to, a high speed valve (<b>21</b>′ of FIG. <b>4</b>), which performs either mechanically, hydraulically, electrically, Piezo or vacuum operated under the control of an engine control module (ECM)-<b>27</b>. In mode 2 or mode 3, a denser, temperature-adjusted, high-pressure charge, with or without accompanying fuel, can, selectively, be injected, at any time during the compression stroke, or even during the combustion process, in order to adjust the charge temperature and increase charge density, to reduce peak and overall combustion temperatures, and to complete the desired charge mixing before combustion.</p>
  <p num="p-0167">In the engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref> the primary air or air/fuel charge to valve <b>16</b>-B is chilled in all modes by expansion valve <b>10</b>′ (optionally, some or all of the charge is bypassed by use of R and X) and associated apparatus to cool cylinder and charge and which along with a low compression ratio for that supplementary portion of charge also means low heat-of-compression for both charge portions.</p>
  <p num="p-0168">The high pressure cool supplementary charge, entering valve <b>16</b>-A after valve <b>16</b>-B has closed, is kept dense in order to produce great power.</p>
  <p num="p-0169">The expansion valves <b>10</b>′ can alternatively have variable openings (nozzle(s)), preferably controlled by the ECM-<b>27</b> to maintain optimum engine temperature and density in regards to polluting emissions and power requirements. For greater power in either mode, expansion valve <b>10</b>′ effluent passage may be further or fully opened to direct a more dense charge into valve <b>16</b>-B during air intake or, alternatively, valve R may be opened, allowing some or all of the high pressure effluent to bypass expansion valve <b>10</b>′ by way of conduit X, bringing a denser air-fuel charge into intake valve <b>16</b>-B. Either of these system, or the two systems in conjunction, preferably controlled by ECM-<b>27</b>, which receives command signals from sensors in the combustion chamber of cylinder <b>7</b> and perhaps other locations. In this case, intake valve <b>16</b>-B preferably allows piston <b>22</b> to go to BDC in the intake stroke before closing, as either valving system of Designs 1 to <b>6</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> engine can be employed.</p>
  <heading>Mode 3</heading> <p num="p-0170">The operation of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref> is simplified by combining the operations of mode 1 and mode 2to operate in a single mode, mode 3, whereby the supplementary, secondary air or air-fuel charge is injected in mode 3 at the same point it would be injected in mode 2 operation, according to the Operational Design of 1 through 6 that is chosen for the particular engine design and duty cycle selected. Thereafter, the engine operates the same as that of mode 2 operation as explained for mode 3 operation in description of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> engine. In other words, modes 1 and 2 are not used intermittently. Hence, the engine is operating in the simpler mode 3 continually.</p>
  <heading>Refrigerated Air Supercharged OTTO and Diesel Cycle Engines Operating in Operational Design 7 4-Stroke Cycle</heading> <p num="p-0171">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-D</figref>, there is shown a six cylinder reciprocating internal combustion engine <b>100</b> <sup>2-D </sup>having one atmospheric air intake <b>8</b>.

Passages of expansion valves <b>10</b>′ and <b>10</b>″ are preferably variable in order to also control the temperature and density of the air charge to the engine. The combustion chambers are sized to establish the compression ratio of the engine which is preferably equal to the expansion ratio. Because of noticeable similarities between the engine <b>100</b> <sup>2 </sup>of FIG. <b>2</b> and that of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-D</figref>, reference will be made as deemed helpful to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-D</figref> for certain common components.</p>

  <p num="p-0174">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-D</figref>, the engines of this invention and any current technology, Otto or Diesel Cycle engine, or any other internal combustion engine or turbine can utilize compression-expansion chilled charge air for greater power and efficiency and engine durability and to lower polluting emissions. As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-D</figref>, the high pressure charge air or air-fuel is chilled by conduits <b>113</b> and <b>114</b>, receiving highly compressed and cooled air, compressed by one or several stages of compression with intercooling. Then, conduits <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> convey the cool dense air or air-fuel charge to and through optional surge tanks below C and B (not shown) to expansion valves <b>10</b>′ and <b>10</b>″ (with optional variable openings), pressure-drop-distributors <b>11</b>′ and <b>11</b>″.

  <p num="p-0175">The air or air-fuel charge can be composed of air and such fuels as gasoline, alcohol, diesel oil, diethyl ether, propane, natural gas or hydrogen, etc. Due to its high density charge and low operating temperature, the engine also becomes a superior engine for hydrogen or diesel fuel operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0176">If the cooled air or air fuel charge in conduits <b>114</b> and <b>113</b> was at a level of, say 200 psi, it could be expanded to a very cold 70 psig working charge, which is about a 5 atmospheric pressure boost. If the initial cold charge was 100 psi, it could be expanded to 15 psi gage for a one atmosphere boost, or it could be expanded to a cold charge of less than atmospheric pressure for an extended expansion combustion process.</p>

The temperature rise at the end of compression is reduced by use of air coolers <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, which cool the charge air. The air charge is then compression-expansion chilled and injected into the power cylinders which temporarily become “evaporators.”.</p>
  <p num="p-0178">During operation, an air charge, originating from air conduit <b>8</b>, by conduits <b>110</b> and <b>109</b>, intercoolers <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, compressors <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, conduits <b>113</b>-<b>114</b>, expansion valve <b>10</b>′, <b>10</b>″, pressure-drop-distributor <b>11</b>′ and <b>11</b>″, and distributor tubes <b>17</b> <i>a </i>and <b>17</b>′<i>a </i>in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-D</figref>, is introduced into the power cylinder <b>7</b> by way of conduits <b>27</b>′<i>a</i>-<b>27</b>′<i>f </i>during the intake stroke by intake valve <b>16</b>-A, which introduces the expanded chilled air charge in order to adjust the temperature, turbulence and charge density. After the air charge has been injected, intake valve <b>16</b>-A, which can be operated hydraulically of electrically, or in some designs, by cam, closes at the BDC. The initial air charge may be boosted to a higher pressure by cutting in an optional second ancillary compressor, in series with compressor <b>2</b> (see for example, compressor <b>1</b> in FIG. <b>2</b>-D). The main compressor to be used in the engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-D</figref> is the compressor <b>2</b>, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-D</figref>, for example as, but not limited to a Lysholm rotary type, between air inlet <b>8</b> and conduits <b>113</b>, <b>114</b> with the air being intercooled and optionally expansion chilled.</p>
  <p num="p-0179">Alternatively, the air bypass valve (ABV) <b>6</b> can be opened to re-circulate charge air back through the compressor <b>1</b> in order to relieve the compressor of compression of some of its work during light-load operation. Additionally, compressor <b>2</b> work can be decreased or increased by control valve <b>4</b> as needed.</p>
  <p num="p-0180">Alternately, inlet ports <b>17</b>-A and <b>17</b>-B of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>7</b> and <b>10</b> are placed in the cylinder wall and a portion of the compressed air is directed to inlet ports <b>17</b>-A, as shown in these figures, and injects air between cylinder <b>7</b> wall and piston <b>22</b>. This will provide cooling for the engine and sweep the area and crevices clean of unburned hydrocarbons and also prevent the formation of formaldehyde. In any of the engines of the present invention, the cooling system in, and described for, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> may be used to help control the temperatures perhaps most importantly in military and/or HCCI operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0181">The expansion valves <b>10</b>′ can alternatively have variable size nozzles and bypass system, valve R and conduit X, controlled by the ECM-<b>27</b> to maintain optimum engine temperature and density in regards to polluting emissions and power requirements. Again, alternatively, the expansion valves may be combined with high-speed cylinder intake valves into one unit.</p>
  <heading>Operation</heading> <p num="p-0182">Atmospheric air is received by duct <b>8</b>, compressed by compressor <b>1</b> where optional carburetor <b>56</b> mixes air and fuel and optionally directs charge through intercooler <b>10</b>. The air is then directed to compressor <b>2</b> and bypass valves <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> where part, or all, of the charge is compressed and directed to intercoolers <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>. This is where part, or all, of the charge is cooled and directed to conduits <b>113</b> and <b>114</b>, leading to expansion valves <b>10</b>′ and <b>10</b>″, pressure-drop-distributors <b>11</b>′ and <b>11</b>″ and distributor tubes <b>17</b> <i>a </i>and <b>17</b>′<i>a </i>which distribute the charge, by way of conduits <b>27</b>′<i>a</i>-<b>27</b>′<i>f</i>, to intake valves <b>16</b> <i>a</i>-A to <b>16</b> <i>f</i>-A which receive the cold charge air into cylinders <b>7</b> <i>a </i>to <b>7</b> <i>f</i>. Valves <b>16</b> <i>a</i>-B to <b>16</b> <i>f</i>-B are exhaust valves leading to exhaust pipes <b>18</b> which lead to turbine of optional turbo-charger compressor <b>1</b> and to the atmosphere at turbo-charger outlet <b>18</b>. The engine operates in the conventional manner. Atmospheric air is received through inlet duct <b>8</b>, compressed by compressor <b>1</b>, cooled, passed to compressor <b>2</b> where it is further compressed, and cooled by intercoolers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>. and sent to expansion chiller system <b>10</b>′, <b>11</b>′ and <b>17</b>′ where the air or air/fuel charge is expanded and ducted to cylinder <b>7</b> intake valves <b>16</b> <i>a</i>-A-<b>16</b> <i>f</i>-A by way of conduits <b>27</b>′<i>a</i>-<b>27</b>′<i>f</i>. Alternatively, pressure-drop expansion is regulated and perhaps reduced by variable expansion valves <b>10</b>′ and/or partly or wholly bypassed through R-X system and the charge goes to inlet valves at the temperature and density required at any particular time preferably controlled by ECM-<b>27</b>, FIG. <b>2</b>.</p>
  <heading>Action</heading> <p num="p-0183">Intake valve <b>16</b>-A opens and piston begins intake (1<sup>st</sup>) stroke. The expanding charge enters intake valve <b>16</b> <i>a</i>-A-<b>16</b> <i>f</i>-A of cylinder <b>7</b>, chilling aided by the low pressure in cylinder. Near or at BDC of piston <b>22</b>, intake valve closes, piston reverses and (2<sup>nd </sup>stroke) compresses the cold charge to perhaps 10-15 degrees before, or at TDC, where the charge, fuel being present, or now injected, is ignited, driving the piston in the power (3<sup>rd</sup>) stroke. Near BDC, exhaust valves (<b>17</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) open and piston <b>22</b> performs the scavenging (4<sup>th</sup>) stroke. Near TDC, exhaust valves close and intake valve <b>16</b>-A opens to begin the next cycle.</p>
  <p num="p-0184">A single rank of cooler <b>9</b>, conduit <b>9</b>′, manifold (C and B, not shown), expansion valve <b>10</b>′, pressure-drop-distributor <b>11</b>′ and evaporator tubes <b>17</b> <i>a </i>and <b>27</b> <i>a </i>of the air chilling system may be employed for cylinder charging, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11-B</figref>, rather than the dual systems illustrated for the engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-D</figref>.</p>
  <heading>Advantages</heading> <p num="p-0185">(1) In general, a cold air charge gives greater steady-state power with lower peak temperatures and pressures for lower polluting emissions.</p>
  <p num="p-0186">(2) The expanded charge intake valve <b>16</b>-A can be closed early, or at BDC and the compression (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke begins for a normal or a substandard compression ratio, the latter providing an extended expansion ratio, for even lower peak pressures and temperatures and higher efficiency.</p>
  <p num="p-0187">(3) When using the charge expanded, the charge pressure can be from 5-7 atmospheres more or less or can be expanded to less than one atmosphere for an extended expansion ratio.</p>
  <p num="p-0188">(4) Power can be adjusted for power or cruising by adjusting the density and pressure of the initial charge and by adjusting expansion valve <b>10</b>′ nozzle to control chilling versus power and/or alternatively, bypassing part or all of the charge through bypass system, valve R and conduit X. (If all, or most of the charge bypasses expansion valve <b>10</b>′, the pressure of the charge entering cylinder <b>7</b>, can be regulated by optional pressure control valves D and E).</p>
  <p num="p-0189">(5) If the compressed air charge is expanded until it is much colder, but less dense than in normal engines, a larger displacement engine will provide greater power in an even cooler working cycle, with low polluting emissions and much longer engine life—ideal for power generation, pumping, etc.</p>
  <p num="p-0190">(6) In any engine designs using compression-expansion air charge-chilling, the pressure of the charge can be adjusted so that after intercooling and expanding, the charge entering the cylinder can be much denser and cooler than in current engines. This produces much greater steady-state power and durability with lower emissions than that of normal engines.</p>
  <p num="p-0191">(7) Increased turbulence and cooler charge results in much lower polluting emissions, especially HC, NO<sub>X </sub>and particulates.</p>
  <p num="p-0192">(Refrigerated air charge 2-stroke engines are described hereafter for <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>).</p>
  <heading>4-Stroke Engine Operating in Operational Design 1-6</heading> <p num="p-0193">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is shown a part sectional view through one power cylinder of the 4-stroke engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, at the two intake valves, showing an alternative method (adaptable to other embodiments of the present invention) of high-pressure air charging and showing a means of mixing fuel and air and of passing air between cylinder wall and piston. This is in order to prevent formation of formaldehyde, CO and unburned hydrocarbons (HC), and of closing bottom inlet port(s) <b>17</b>-B while popette valve <b>16</b>-A is closing high-pressure inlet from conduit <b>15</b>-A and top inlet to conduit <b>17</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0194">The charge air or air-fuel may be compressed and cooled for any of Operational Designs 1 through 6, as described and illustrated for <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-B</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref> engines. Additionally and alternatively, compression-expansion chilling may be employed before induction into cylinder <b>12</b>, the latter system by employing the compression chiller system shown in, and described for <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-B</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-D</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11-B</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18-B</figref>, items <b>10</b>′, <b>11</b>′, <b>12</b>, <b>17</b> <i>a </i>and <b>27</b>′<i>a</i>, supplying chilled, high-pressure air through intake valve <b>16</b>-A by one or more compressors, with the engine operation being the same as that described for engine of FIG. <b>2</b>. Alternatively, the high-pressure conduit can divide, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>, and supply air to both inlets <b>16</b>-B and <b>16</b>-A, with valve <b>16</b>-B receiving the compression-expansion chilled primary charge and intake valve <b>16</b>-A receiving the dense and cooled high-pressure air charge, with the engine operation being the same as that of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref> with optional pressure regulator on the secondary air charge inlet conduit <b>16</b>-A.</p>
  <heading>Mode 1</heading> <p num="p-0195">The operation of this engine is similar to the operation of the engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>, operating in either system of Design 1 through Design 6, as described for engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, with low-pressure air, or alternatively expansion chilled air or air-fuel entering cylinder <b>12</b> through intake valve <b>16</b>-B on the intake (1<sup>st</sup>) stroke in which alternatively, intake valve <b>16</b>-B may be closed before, at or after BDC to capture either a normal or small air charge, (Designs 1 through Design 4 in FIG. <b>2</b>). (In closing after BDC, the intake valve may be left open to near TDC on the compression (2<sup>nd</sup>) piston stroke. Therefore, the primary charge would be expelled after cooling cylinder <b>12</b> (Design 4 of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> engine). At the end of the intake stroke, compression (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke begins and near TDC of piston, the fuel-air charge is ignited for the power (3<sup>rd</sup>) stroke. Then the scavenging (4<sup>th</sup>) stroke occurs and a new power cycle begins. This produces normal power with low fuel consumption and low polluting emissions.</p>
  <heading>Optional Mode 2</heading> <p num="p-0196">When more power is needed, intake valve <b>16</b>-B opens and receives the primary air charge by the intake (1<sup>st</sup>) piston stroke. Then a high density, supplementary air charge is injected as follows: Preferably during the compression (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke to as far as TDC, high-pressure intake valve <b>16</b>-A opens (always after valve <b>16</b>-B closes) and closes quickly, injecting temperature adjusted, high-pressure air from conduit <b>15</b>-A as described for engines of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or FIG. <b>2</b>. (The compression ratio and, hence, the amount of heat produced for this second portion of air depends on the point in the compression stroke that the second portion of air is injected). Inlet valve <b>16</b>-A is preferably activated by valve mechanism represented by <b>21</b>′, which can open and close within 40° crank angle. The valve <b>16</b>-A can be of any fast-acting type. The incoming air streams <b>15</b>-A and <b>15</b>-C can be both carburated (except for Design 4) or alternatively, singularly carbureted, or fuel can be added at any point including cylinder injection for a homogenized air/fuel mixture.</p>
  <p num="p-0197">During or at the end of the compression stroke, as inlet valve <b>16</b>-A opens, part of the inlet air passes into cylinder <b>12</b> directly and part of the compressed charge travels past the now open valve <b>16</b>-A (which can be structured in various ways) into conduit <b>17</b> to common air rail (in phantom) <b>17</b>-A. Here, the charge is directed to inlet port(s) <b>17</b>-B (which can be singular with air rail <b>17</b>-A being eliminated).</p>
  <p num="p-0198">The high-pressure air or air and fuel enters high pressure cylinder valve <b>16</b>-A for excellent turbulent mixing of the charge. The compression (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke continues, piston <b>22</b> covers port(s) <b>17</b>-B and valve <b>16</b>-A closes, earlier or later, covering both port from conduit <b>15</b>-A and top open port to conduit <b>17</b>. The place in the cylinder wall best suited for mixing, cooling, etc. should be chosen for placing inlet port(s) <b>17</b>-B by experimentation and calculations. The secondary high-pressure air charge mixes any charge in the cylinder, adjusts temperature and adds density to produce greater power, fuel economy and low polluting emissions, with low peak temperatures and pressures, further reducing polluting emissions and providing longer engine life. As the piston <b>22</b> continues to rise in the compression (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke, less heat of compression, and no heat of compression for Design 4 of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> engine, reduces NO<sub>X </sub>and CO formation. Also, the heat of compression for the secondary air charge is low and the compression ratio of that portion is set by the point in the stroke this air was injected. Particulates are also greatly reduced because of the homogenizing of the charge for more complete combustion. Unburned hydrocarbons (HC) are reduced greatly because of better mixing of fuel and oxygen and, in addition, the gentle air injection between cylinder wall <b>12</b> and piston <b>22</b> as the piston passes open ports <b>17</b>-B cleans out piston ring crevices where unburned fuel hides. This also vents and cools space between piston <b>22</b> and cylinder <b>12</b> walls above the first piston ring where most formaldehyde forms. At near TDC the charge is ignited by spark, compression (glow plug), modified HCCI or HCCI. During the power (3<sup>rd</sup>) stroke, the pressurized air, which is trapped in conduit <b>17</b>, is released as piston uncovers inlet port(s) <b>17</b>-B, the trapped compressed air in conduit <b>17</b> rushes out <b>17</b>-B, again cleaning crevices and space between cylinder wall <b>12</b> and piston <b>22</b> for more complete combustion. The piston <b>22</b> now rises in the scavenging (4<sup>th</sup>) stroke and a new cycle begins. (If Design 4 of the engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is utilized, an outlet valve <b>16</b>-C (not shown) or intake valve <b>16</b>-B stays open until near TDC on the compression stroke and expels the full or almost complete primary charge near TDC using it only to cool cylinder <b>12</b> with the supplementary supercharge supplying all charge needed, being injected by valve <b>16</b>-A near TDC.)</p>
  <heading>Mode 3</heading> <p num="p-0199">Mode 3 operation constitutes a method of operating the engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in a single mode with full power and efficiency by combining mode 1 and mode 2 operations as described for engine <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and operating alternatively in any of the Operational Designs described. This mode is simplified by eliminating valving, etc., which are required to operate modes 1 and 2 intermittently.</p>
  <heading>4-Stroke Engine Operating in Operational Design 1-6</heading> <p num="p-0200">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there is shown a part sectional view through one power cylinder similar to the 4-stroke engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> at the two intake valves, operating in any system of Operational Design 1 through Design 6, as described for engine of FIG. <b>2</b>. This shows an alternative method (adaptable to other embodiments of the present invention) of supplementary high pressure air charging after the primary air has been induced by the intake (1<sup>st</sup>) stroke. This is a means of increasing charge density and of mixing fuel and air and of passing air (somewhat differently from that of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) between cylinder wall <b>12</b> and piston <b>22</b> and of cleaning out piston ring crevices in order to prevent formation of formaldehyde, CO, unburned hydrocarbons (HC) and of closing inlet port(s) <b>17</b>-B while inlet valve <b>16</b>-A is closing. Low peak temperatures and high turbulence greatly reduce NO<sub>X </sub>emissions and particulates.</p>
  <heading>Mode 1</heading> <p num="p-0201">The operation of the engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is similar to that of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-B</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, with the primary air charge in all designs except Operational Design 1 of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> engine, alternatively having a low compression ratio with cool or chilled, low pressure primary air, or air-fuel charge coming in on the intake (1<sup>st</sup>) stroke of piston <b>22</b>, which is then compressed (2<sup>nd </sup>stroke) and, with fuel present, is fired for normal power (3<sup>rd </sup>stroke) such as cruising with low polluting emissions. The scavenging (4<sup>th</sup>) stroke follows. This completes one power cycle.</p>
  <heading>Mode 2</heading> <p num="p-0202">When greater power is needed. the operation is thus: following the intake (1<sup>st</sup>) stroke of piston <b>22</b>, a supplementary, secondary high-pressure air or air-fuel charge is injected during or at the end of the compression (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke, by intake valve <b>16</b>-A. The supplementary air entering cylinder <b>12</b> is solely from conduit <b>17</b>, through common air-rail <b>17</b>-A and inlet port(s) <b>17</b>-B. This is another means of homogenization, increasing density and adjusting the density and temperature of the charge. (Common air-rail <b>17</b>-A and all but one of inlet ports <b>17</b>-B may be eliminated.)</p>
  <p num="p-0203">Alternatively, the primary or supplementary charge air or air-fuel charge can be compression-expansion chilled before intake into cylinder <b>12</b> through valve <b>16</b>-B or <b>16</b>-A respectively by utilizing the expansion valve chiller system depicted in and described for <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref> and FIG. <b>3</b>.</p>
  <heading>Detailed Operation of Mode 3 (Single Mode Operation)</heading> <p num="p-0204">Intake valve <b>16</b>-B opens, piston <b>22</b> descends in intake (1<sup>st</sup>) stroke to admit atmospheric pressure air or air boosted in pressure, which is alternatively cooled or chilled. The primary charge intake system is either of the Methods of Primary Air Charging of Operational Designs 1 through Design 6, as described for engine of FIG. <b>2</b>. After the primary charge has been received and intake valve <b>16</b>-B has closed, the piston <b>22</b> reaches BDC and the compression (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke begins. During the compression stroke of each cycle, intake valve <b>16</b>-A opens and injects a supplementary, secondary cool or chilled, dense air charge into port <b>17</b> and through port <b>17</b>A or ports <b>17</b>-B. After port(s) <b>17</b>-B, which can be of any number or place deemed appropriate within cylinder <b>12</b> wall are closed, compression continues and at, or near TDC of piston <b>22</b>. Ignition then takes place for the power (3<sup>rd</sup>) stroke, followed by the 4<sup>th </sup>or exhaust stroke. In the engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, compressed air sweeps out ring crevices and space above top piston ring between piston and cylinder wall and some of the compressed air is trapped in conduit <b>17</b> during the compression stroke. As piston <b>22</b> expands in the power stroke, the residual compressed air in conduit <b>17</b> expands against piston <b>22</b>, again cleaning out crevices and other spaces and then expands into the cylinder, further mixing oxygen and fuel for more complete combustion. Operation is the same as that of Operational Designs 1-6 of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-B</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> engines.</p>
  <heading>Military Model 4-Stroke Air-Cooled Engine Operating in Operational Designs 1-6</heading> <p num="p-0205">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there is shown a perspective view (with portions in cross section) of the cylinder block and head of an internal combustion engine, operating in a 4-stroke cycle, operating in either system of Design 1 through Design 6, as described for engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-B</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref> and representing a preferred embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention, from which a first method of operation can be performed and will be described. Among its other components, this embodiment is seen as having an auxiliary cooling system to provide engine cooling during such time as the liquid cooling system should be damaged. Due to the overall cooler working cycle of the engine of this invention air-cooling becomes simple and efficient.</p>
  <p num="p-0206">The operation of the engine is the same as the operation of the engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> with a first mode and optional second and preferred third modes of operation, as described for engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>, FIG. <b>3</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> with the following alternative arrangements:</p>
  <p num="p-0207">The engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is fitted with a high performance air compressor, which could be a dedicated compressor (not shown), or the compressor <b>2</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref> and could be fitted with branching conduits, one of which would be fitted with control valve(s) and lead from fittings C and B, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref> leading from intercooler(s) <b>11</b> and/or <b>12</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>, and would be attached to an inlet port in the engine head or engine block, in this case, engine head at port <b>4</b>. Engine port <b>4</b>, alternatively, is fitted with an expansion valve <b>4</b>′. Thus, expanding cool, highly compressed air is sent through ports and passages in engine or alternatively pumped through port <b>4</b> and expansion valve <b>4</b>′, sending the expanding air chilled through passages which now become evaporator tubes within the engine head and block. In addition, the compressed cool and chilled air can be directed through cooling channel(s) <b>6</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> in walls of cylinder sleeve <b>12</b> of FIG. <b>6</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0208">The system for supplying compression-expansion chilled air, which can alternatively be used for both engine operating charge air and engine cooling air is described for engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>, FIG. <b>3</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in which system any type of efficient compressor system may be employed.</p>
  <heading>Military Model 4-Stroke New Cycle Engine</heading> <p num="p-0209">Since about fifty percent of combat vehicle engine failures during battle conditions are historically due to loss of the cooling system, the ability to switch to auxiliary cooling will be a boon to the military, allowing the vehicle to continue in its duty and to return home. When running on auxiliary cooling, the engine uses about twice the amount of compressed air as when liquid cooled. For this reason, when switched to air-cooling, fuel economy is slightly compromised, but for the military, under battle conditions, this will be happily tolerated.</p>
  <p num="p-0210">There are several designs of the New Cycle Engine that are capable of providing efficient auxiliary cooling at such a time that the liquid cooling system should fail. Described here are only two such designs for a 4-stroke engine and three such designs for a 2-stroke engine.</p>
  <heading>Operation of 4-Stroke New Cycle Air-Cooled Engine</heading> <p num="p-0211">The operation of the engine is the same as any of Operational Designs 1 through Design 6, as first described for the basic engine of FIG. <b>2</b> and which also pertains to engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1 through 7</figref> for greater torque, power, and durability with low fuel consumption and ultra low polluting emissions.</p>
  <p num="p-0212">Alternatively and preferably, the operation of the engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is the same as the operation of the engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>, FIG. <b>3</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> with optionally chilled air for primary charge through valve <b>16</b>-B with the supplementary, secondary air charge being introduced through valve <b>16</b>-A as a very dense cool charge.</p>
  <heading>Cooler Working Cycle</heading> <p num="p-0213">In Operational Design 1 through Design 6, described for engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the low, or near 2:1 or less compression ratios (the latter being in Design 4) greatly reduces the amount of heat-of-compression in mode 1, which is Design 4 can be near zero.</p>
  <p num="p-0214">In mode 2 operation, the injection of cooled, compressed, supplementary supercharging air, which preferably is during the compression stroke, cools the air charge in all six Operational Designs by the heat exchange effect and by the absorption effect of expanding air, as is true of all compressed gases when expanded. In all modes, 1, 2 and steady-state mode 3 for Designs 2 through 6, the primary portion of air charge is heated less as the compression ratio or the “effective” compression ratio is reduced. The density of the air or air-fuel charge is adjusted selectively from less than normal, to normal or to above normal in all Operational Designs by the injection of the supplementary, secondary air charge. For mode 2 and 3, the later the supplementary air charge is injected in the compression stroke in Designs 1 through 3 and 5 and 6, the smaller will be the “effective” compression ratio for that second portion of air, for again, low heat-of-compression and in Design 4, the compression ratio is near 2:1 for little or no heat of compression. Because of the overall cooler-working cycle, the engine can be operated with air-cooling or “compression” air chill-cooling at such a time the liquid cooling system should be damaged.</p>
  <heading>Auxiliary Cooled Operation</heading> <p num="p-0215">At such a time that the liquid cooling system should be compromised, operation of the engine would continue in the same manner with a few additional steps. This would allow the vehicle to continue to perform in battle and to return home. This cooling system can be also used on any Otto or Diesel Cycle engine.</p>
  <p num="p-0216">Pressurized air flow to cylinder head inlet <b>4</b> is begun by opening a valve to dedicated compressor and cooler system or by increasing compressor <b>2</b> speed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>2</b>-C, where a valved branch (not shown) of high pressure conduit B in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> would deliver adequate compressed air to port <b>4</b> or alternatively to a metering or expansion valve <b>4</b>′, opening to inlet port <b>4</b>, and perhaps by cutting in another stage of compression or another compressor.</p>
  <p num="p-0217">Valves from an air conduit, from C and B on conduits <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> from coolers <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, all in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>, to expansion valve <b>4</b>′, opening to inlet <b>4</b> of engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> optionally is opened and compressed air or expanding compressed air chills as it expands internally by the expansion valve <b>4</b>′ from inlet port <b>4</b> to air-rail <b>5</b>. This allows the air to be conducted as it expands and distributes to and through cooling “evaporator” channels <b>6</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which are finned <b>6</b>′ in FIG. <b>6</b> and situated on the outer side of the cylinder sleeve <b>12</b> between the cylinder sleeve <b>12</b> and the cylinder block <b>12</b>′ as shown in FIG. <b>6</b>. The expanding compressed air then is ducted into air rail <b>7</b> which collects the air from all channels, and directs it to an air conduit <b>8</b> which conducts the air to the atmosphere or to exhaust manifold <b>9</b> and to the atmosphere. Part of the expanding air can be sent first through channels around the exhaust valve seat and through other problem areas of the engine. If the air cooling channels suggested for cooling the cylinder liners cool too much, other areas of the engine more appropriate for air cooling channels may be chosen, as one alternate cooling route is depicted by <b>6</b> in FIG. <b>7</b> and FIG. <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0218">While the engine is operating liquid cooled, all of the high-pressure air goes to high pressure conduit B with conduit A being alternatively being fitted with expansion valve <b>10</b>′, going to intake valve <b>16</b>-B during intake stroke, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>. While operating in mode 2 or 3 with compressed secondary supercharging air, injected preferably with pressure adjusted in conduit B, goes directly into the power cylinders through inlet valve <b>16</b>-A during the compression stroke, even as late as during combustion.</p>
  <p num="p-0219">When the liquid cooling system fails, a valve is turned on conduits F and G (not shown) which diverges from conduits <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> or from conduits <b>113</b>′ and <b>114</b>′ of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref> or any other compressed air source, which supplies highly compressed air, which is cooled or chilled. This air is pumped by a conduit branch (not shown) from conduits <b>113</b>′ and <b>114</b>′ or <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> and preferably into metering or expansion valve <b>4</b>′ at inlet <b>4</b> of engine head. Now incoming air, which has been cooled and increased in pressure and density, passes through expansion valve <b>4</b>′ alternatively, which can have a variable size opening, which can be controlled by the ECM-<b>27</b>, at inlet <b>4</b>, to air rail <b>5</b>, conduits <b>6</b>, air rail <b>7</b>, air conduit <b>8</b> and exhaust manifold <b>9</b> and to the atmosphere or the air can go from conduit <b>8</b> directly to the atmosphere. The engine head and block are then cooled by the compressed air or alternatively by the chilling effect of the absorption of heat by the expanding air, as it does work in expanding through valve <b>4</b>′ or valve <b>10</b>′, pressure-drop-distributor <b>11</b> and distributor tubes <b>17</b> <i>a </i>and <b>27</b> <i>a</i>, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>. Alternatively, the engine is further cooled by the primary air charge injection through expansion valves <b>10</b>′ upline to inlet valves <b>16</b>-B, as described for <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, which provide chill cooling, and in the engines of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, FIG. <b>7</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, optionally having chilled air being injected through cylinder walls, as described for these engines, operating under description for <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>, FIG. <b>3</b>. and FIG. <b>4</b>. As more power is needed, the density of charge can be increased by increasing the pressure on the non-expanded charge from conduits <b>113</b>″ and <b>114</b>″ to high pressure inlet valve <b>16</b>-A. These lines <b>113</b>′ and <b>114</b>′ are alternatively fitted with pressure regulators D and E.</p>
  <p num="p-0220">The engine can also be fitted with diminutive cooling fins <b>13</b>. The cooling fan, if still operating, will assist in the cooling. Also, the fan of any existing heater, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> or <b>11</b>-B, item <b>27</b>, can divert cool pumped air to the now empty water jacket of the engine. In addition, the pistons may be cooled by splash-oil cooling, in which oil-cooling radiator will be small and can be protected by engine components and armor.</p>
  <p num="p-0221">The New Cycle Engine is inherently cooler operating as a study of the working cycle shows and can be cooled very effectively by pumping compressed air or expanding chilled air through conduits in cylinder head and block, as described herein.</p>
  <p num="p-0222">The efficiency of the engine is improved by compressing and cooling a large portion of the charge air, all in Design 4, outside of a hot firing cylinder and by more complete combustion because of better mixing of the fuel/air charge. Efficiency is also improved by the extended expansion process in Design 3 through Design 6 and by thermodynamic improvements inherent in a denser air charge. Fuel economy is further improved by a greater power-to-weight ratio.</p>
  <p num="p-0223">The engine may be operated preferably in the single mode (3) operation, or alternatively and selectively in mode 1 or mode 2.</p>
  <p num="p-0224">Power is increased by the improved thermodynamics of a denser charge, which also allows more fuel to be utilized and by more complete combustion and by reduced compression work.</p>
  <p num="p-0225">Emissions are less because of low peak temperatures and pressures and by more complete combustion. In both current and HCCI Diesel engines, particulates (both smoke and nano-particles) are very significantly reduced by the more complete combustion due to the pre-mixing (homogenization) of fuel/air charge before ignition and by the low temperature oxidation process. HC and aldehydes are reduced by injected air sweeping out piston ring crevices and other close tolerance areas between piston and cylinder wall.</p>
  <p num="p-0226">Durability is improved by the overall cooler working cycle and low peak temperatures and pressures, and in some duty cycles, lower RPM allowed by higher torque.</p>
  <p num="p-0227">Air compressor(s) would be compact, low profiled and armored, with conduits being of high tensile strength. Some of the compressed air can be diverted and expanded in cooling jackets around the compressor(s) and oil cooler, if the latter is used. The chief advantage of optional operation of modes 1 or 2 is that at any time ancillary compressor <b>2</b>, coolers <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> are damaged, the vehicle operates in mode 1 to allow the vehicle to continue functioning with adequate power and to return home.</p>

  <heading>Operational Design 8(a)</heading> <p num="p-0246">Piston <b>22</b> is at (BDC) (after power stroke) and high-pressure inlet valve <b>16</b>-A is closed.</p>
  <p num="p-0247">A Roots Type Blower and conduits (not shown) supplies lightly compressed air for scavenging and cylinder charging to inlet ports <b>11</b> of cylinder <b>12</b>, or alternatively, conduit <b>27</b>′<i>a</i>, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref> supplies air to inlet ports <b>11</b>, optionally expanded through expansion valve <b>10</b>′, pressure-drop-distributor <b>11</b>, evaporator tubes <b>17</b> <i>a </i>and <b>27</b> <i>a </i>for exhaust scavenging, cooling and charging of cylinder <b>12</b> with fresh chilled air.

  <heading>Mode 1</heading> <p num="p-0248">Exhaust valve <b>8</b>-B is open.

This produces a normal optionally cool or chilled compression ratio which is equal to the expansion ratio. The compression (1<sup>st</sup>) stroke continues and near TDC, fuel is added, if not present, and the charge is ignited for the power (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke and at near BDC or the appropriate point, exhaust valve <b>8</b>-B opens for the exhaust blow-down and fresh scavenging, charging air enters ports <b>11</b>, now open, and another cycle begins. This completes one normal power cycle.</p>
  <heading>Optional Mode 2 for Greater power</heading> <p num="p-0249">Exhaust valve <b>8</b>-B is open. Exhaust blow-down has already occurred and the cylinder <b>12</b> has been scavenged and charged by fresh air entering ports <b>11</b>. Piston <b>22</b> begins to rise in the compression stroke, closing ports <b>11</b> as exhaust valve <b>8</b>-B closes. High pressure air inlet valve <b>16</b>-A opens at any point deemed feasible during compression stroke to inject a dense, cool, high velocity, supplementary, secondary air charge, which is externally compressed in one or more stages as from conduits <b>113</b>′ and <b>114</b>′ in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref> and into inlet conduit B in FIG. <b>8</b>. Compression continues and near TDC, fuel being present, the charge is ignited and the power (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke occurs for great power and low polluting emissions. At the appropriate point, exhaust valve <b>8</b>-B opens and the cylinder is scavenged and filled with fresh, cool charge. This completes one very powerful and clean power cycle.</p>
  <p num="p-0250">The supplementary supercharging air can be compression-expansion chilled, as from expansion valve <b>10</b>′ and conduit <b>27</b>′<i>a</i>-<b>27</b> <i>f </i>of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-B</figref>. Depending on the temperature and pressure before being expanded, the pressure passing intake valve <b>16</b>-A during the compression stroke, can be adjusted to as much as a very cold 5-7 atmospheres pressure.

  <heading>Operational Design 8(b)</heading> <heading>Mode 1</heading> <p num="p-0252">In this design, one power cycle has ended. Exhaust valve <b>8</b>-B is open.

Exhaust valve <b>8</b>-B closes and piston <b>22</b> begins to rise in the compression stroke, closing inlet ports <b>11</b> and trapping as large a charge as possible. But, in this Design 8(b), the combustion chamber is very large, resulting in a very low (substandard) compression ratio for the cylinder. For example, rather than, say a 20:1 compression ratio, this design would produce a compression ratio of perhaps 10:1 or less. For a gasoline engine, the compression ratio may perhaps be 5:1 or less.</p>
  <p num="p-0253">Piston <b>22</b> rises in the compression (1<sup>st</sup>) stroke and near piston TDC, fuel is added, if not present. The charge is ignited for the power (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke and at the proper point in the power stroke, exhaust valve <b>8</b>-B opens for the exhaust Blow-Down and at bottom of power (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke ports <b>11</b> are uncovered to admit scavenging and charging air to begin another cycle. (With this substandard compression ratio, the heat-of-compression for the primary air charge can be as little as 1/5 that of normal engines for low heat-of-compression and low emissions. This completes one clean power cycle for mode 1 auxiliary operation, e.g., for continuing in battle and returning home safely if auxiliary air compressor-cooler system is damaged. (Mode 1 operation is especially feasible when the primary air charge is boosted significantly in pressure).</p>
  <heading>Mode 2, Preferred</heading> <p num="p-0254">Exhaust valve <b>8</b>-B closes, as the compression stroke begins closing cylinder ports <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> being charged with fresh air. Somewhere during the compression stroke, valve <b>16</b>-A opens and injects a very dense high-pressure, non-expanded, cooled supplementary, secondary air charge as from conduits <b>113</b>′ and <b>114</b>′ of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref> or optionally chilled air from conduit <b>27</b> <i>a </i>of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>. The supplementary supercharging secondary air charge can bring the density of the total charge to that of a normal engine, say with the nominal 20:1 compression ratio. The secondary charge can produce, selectively, even 40:1 compression ratio density or a much greater density and can greatly supercharge the engine with low peak temperatures and pressures, which with the better mixing of the cool charge produces much greater power with ultra low emissions. (The amount of heat-of-compression for the supercharging secondary air charge depends on what point in the compression stroke that portion is injected.) The “effective” compression ratio for the supplementary portion of the charge can be as low as 2:1 or 3:1 for again ultra low compression ratio. Yet, as stated, the charge density can have the density (compactness) of a 40:1 compression ratio or even much higher.</p>
  <heading>Mode 3</heading> <p num="p-0255">Modes 1 and 2 are combined for simplicity to form mode 3. This is accomplished by eliminating the system for temporarily deactivating intake valve <b>16</b>-A and/or compressor <b>2</b> operation, as is done in mode 1 operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0256">Optional Design 8(c). Mode 1</p>
  <p num="p-0257">A power cycle is completed and for some distance after closing of ports <b>11</b> by piston <b>22</b>, in the scavenging, charging (1<sup>st</sup>) stroke, the exhaust valve <b>8</b>-B stays open during the first part of the compression stroke to expel a portion of the fresh air charge in order to trap a smaller-than-normal volume of charge air and then exhaust valve <b>8</b>-B closes. The compression (1<sup>st</sup>) stroke continues and near piston TDC, fuel is added, if not present and ignited, producing the power (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke and at near BDC or at the appropriate point, exhaust valve <b>8</b>-B opens and exhaust Blow-Down occurs by blower or compressor, and cylinder is scavenged and filled with cool, fresh charge air which can be cool or chilled. This completes one cycle for adequate cruising power with an extended expansion process and low polluting emissions.</p>
  <heading>Mode 2</heading> <p num="p-0258">When more power is needed, the following takes place: After scavenging and charging cylinder <b>22</b>, at any point in the compression stroke deemed appropriate after closure of exhaust valve <b>8</b>-B, inlet valve <b>16</b>-A opens and quickly closes, injecting very dense, temperature adjusted supplementary charge air as from conduits <b>113</b>′ and <b>114</b>′ of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>, or optionally expansion chilled, supplementary, secondary air or air-fuel charge from conduit <b>27</b>′<i>a </i>of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-B</figref>. The compression stroke continues. Fuel is added, if not present, and near TDC of piston <b>22</b>, the charge is ignited and the power (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke occurs for great power with low peak temperatures and with low polluting emissions with the expansion ratio still being greater than the effective compression ratio.</p>
  <p num="p-0259">Capturing a subnormal initial charge produces a substandard “effective” compression ratio with a very low heat-of-compression. A denser than normal supplementary, secondary cool air or cold charge produces low heat-of-compression also, and together still produces an extended expansion ratio. As in the 4-stroke engine, the effective compression ratio and hence, the amount of heat-of-compression for the supplementary, secondary charge depends on the point in the compression stroke the secondary charge is injected. The compression ratio for the supplementary, secondary air charge can be as low as 2:1 or 3:1 with a charge density equal to 20:1 or 40:1 or greater.</p>
  <p num="p-0260">Should ancillary compressor <b>1</b> or <b>2</b> or intercooler system become damaged while operating in mode 2, the engine instantly switches to mode 1 operation and continues to operate with normal engine power to continue operation and to return home. This makes mode 2 operation the preferred system for the military.</p>
  <heading>Mode 3</heading> <p num="p-0261">This method of operation of the engine of FIG. <b>8</b>)<i>c</i>) is by eliminating the deactivator for intake valve <b>16</b>-A, thus combining mode 1 and 2 into a simple operating mode 3 system, except for military for which mode 2 is preferred.</p>
  <heading>Operational Design 8(d), Mode. 1</heading> <p num="p-0262">In another alternative Operational Design, a power cycle is completed and piston <b>22</b> continues to rise in the scavenging-charging (1<sup>st</sup>) stroke as exhaust valve <b>8</b>-B remains open to near TDC, where it closes after cooling cylinder and expelling nearly all of the fresh, cold charge which was induced into cylinder <b>12</b> by way of inlet ports <b>11</b>. At the point near TDC, that exhaust valve <b>8</b>-B closed, high-pressure intake valve <b>16</b>-A opens and closes, injecting the entire working air charge which is very dense, cool and of high velocity and either pre-mixed with fuel or injected simultaneously with fuel, with the engine having a cool effective compression ratio of perhaps 3:1 or 2:1 or less. The charge is ignited near TDC as soon as intake valve <b>16</b>-A closes for the power stroke with an extended expansion ratio. (This Operational Design 4 of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> engine is the easiest design in which to air cool the engine structure. The latter system is much like putting a cartridge in a rifle and firing same for each power stroke. The secondary and only air charge in this design can be the highly compressed, cool air as from conduits <b>113</b>′ and <b>114</b>′ of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref> or can be expansion chilled as from conduit <b>27</b>′<i>a </i>as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-B</figref>. In Operational Designs 8 through 10, fuel is injected, if not present, at any point deemed proper and near TDC the charge is ignited by spark, compression, modified HCCI or true HCCI.) (The air or air-fuel injection occurs just far enough before piston TDC to allow the charge injection and ignition to occur at the opportune point before or at TDC to produce the most power and efficiency.)</p>
  <p num="p-0263">The burning gases depress the piston in the power (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke for great power with both fuel consumption and polluting emissions greatly reduced. The new Cycle Engine is inherently cooler operating as a study of the working cycle shows and the engine block and head can very effectively be cooled by pumping cool highly compressed air through port <b>4</b> or alternatively, first through expansion valve <b>4</b>′ in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, to conduits in cylinder head, cylinder walls <b>6</b> in FIG. <b>6</b> and block, all of which are low pressure, and act as evaporator tubes as described herein for the engine of FIG. <b>5</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0264">The efficiency of the engine is improved by (a) thermodynamic improvements of increased charge density, by (b) compressing all of the air charge outside of a hot firing cylinder, by (c) more complete combustion due to better mixing of the fuel/air charge and by (d) the extended expansion process in Operational Designs 4 and in Operational Design 8(c).</p>
  <p num="p-0265">Power is increased by (a) the improved thermodynamics of a denser charge, which also allows more fuel to be utilized, by (b) more complete combustion and by (c) reduced compression work.</p>
  <p num="p-0266">Emissions are less because of (a) low peak temperatures and pressures, by (b) more complete combustion and by (c) particulates in Diesel engines (both smoke and nano-particles) being significantly reduced by the more complete combustion due to the pre-mixing (homogenization) of fuel/air charge before ignition.</p>
  <p num="p-0267">Durability is improved by the overall cooler working cycle and low peak temperatures and pressures and in some duty cycles, by low RPM allowed by greater torque.</p>
  <p num="p-0268">In each of the 2-stroke engines of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the expansion valves <b>10</b>′ which are alternative, can alternatively have variable openings (nozzle(s)), preferably controlled by the EMC-<b>27</b> to maintain optimum engine temperature and density in regards to polluting emissions and power requirements. For greater power, if utilizing chilled charge air, expansion valve <b>10</b>′ nozzles may be opened further to direct a more dense charge into ports <b>11</b>, or alternatively, by opening valve R and allowing some or all of the high pressure effluent to bypass expansion valve <b>10</b>′ by way of conduit X as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>.

  <heading>2-Stroke Air-Cooled Engine Operating in Operational Design 9</heading> <p num="p-0282">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, there is shown a perspective view (with portions in cross-section) of the cylinder block and head of an internal combustion engine operating in a 2-stroke cycle, and representing a second 2-stroke embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention from which still another method of operation can be performed and will be described. Among its other components, this embodiment is seen as having one atmospheric air intake, with one high pressure charge-air route B, a common air-rail and ports <b>11</b>-B leading from an optional Roots Blower and conduits (not shown), or alternatively, from compressor <b>1</b> and conduit <b>32</b> to provide an optional air charging system, or alternatively, a charge air cooling system with items <b>10</b>′, <b>11</b>′, <b>17</b> and <b>27</b>′<i>a </i>as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref> to inlet ports <b>11</b> of power cylinder <b>22</b> of FIG. <b>9</b>. The high pressure supplementary charge air route conduit B and intake valve <b>16</b>-A is supplied by conduits <b>15</b>-A of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, or optionally, conduits <b>114</b>″-<b>113</b>″ as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref> or by conduits <b>27</b>′<i>a</i>-<b>27</b>′<i>f </i>of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-B</figref>. Other components are an exhaust valve <b>8</b>-B and conduits <b>9</b> to the atmosphere. Also provided are the power and engine head and block air cooler system, including chill cooling by expansion valve <b>4</b>′ as described for <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, FIG. <b>7</b> and FIG. <b>8</b>.</p>
  <heading>Military Model of 2-Stroke New Cycle Engine</heading> <p num="p-0283">The operation of the 2-stroke engine, using charging Operational Design 8 through Design 10, is the same as described for the basic 2-Stroke New Cycle of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> Engine's four alternate Operational Design systems 8-A through 8-D for greater torque, power, and durability, with low fuel consumption and ultra low polluting emissions. This engine, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, offers triple mode operation of the 2-Stroke new cycle engine with primary and supplementary, secondary air charge, the same as engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> with the exception that an automatic one-way valve offers improvements as described for engine of FIG. <b>7</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0284">Additionally, auxiliary valve <b>2</b>′, which is automatic, will prevent charge-air back-flow from cylinder <b>7</b>. This feature will prevent any back-flow from occurring during the compression or expansion strokes of the engine of this invention. This feature can also be used to establish the initial pressure ratio of the engine, either variable or constant. When secondary charge air is being received through intake valve <b>16</b>-A, the intake valve <b>16</b>-A can be kept open during the compression stroke to near TDC of piston <b>22</b>, since automatic valve <b>2</b>′ closes at such time the pressure in cylinder <b>12</b> approximates the pressure in intake runner conduit B. Therefore, the pressure differential between cylinder <b>12</b> and intake runner B will allow closure of automatic valve <b>2</b>′, even though intake valve <b>16</b>-A may still be open, allowing the initial pressure ratio of cylinder <b>12</b> to be controlled by the pressure of any charge air coming through intake runner B, which in turn is controlled by valves <b>3</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b> (as described for engines of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) and compressor speed for engines having a single stage of pre-compression. Valves <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> and compressor speed would control the initial pressure ratios for engines having two stages of pre-compression. There are also fast acting intake valves, some of which open and close in 40 degrees crank angle. The new Cycle Engine is inherently cooler operating, as a study of the working cycle shows, and can very effectively be cooled by pumping compressed, cool air or compressed air that is expanded through a expansion valve <b>4</b>′ which chills conduits (evaporator) in cylinder head, walls and block, as described herein for the engine of FIG. <b>5</b>.</p>

  <heading>Military Model of 2-Stroke New Cycle Engine</heading> <p num="p-0292">The operation of the 2-stroke engine is very similar to the basic 2-Stroke New Cycle Engine System of FIG. <b>8</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, for greater torque, power, and durability with low fuel consumption and ultra low polluting emissions. The operation of this particular design is this:</p>
  <heading>Operation of the 2-Stroke New Cycle Engine</heading> <p num="p-0293">The operation of engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is the same as that of the engines of FIG. <b>8</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> for mode 1 operation, except that in mode 2 and 3 a difference is being able to inject the supplementary, secondary air charge through ports in the cylinder wall and ports <b>17</b>A and <b>17</b>B and alternatively to simultaneously inject cold supercharging air through an automatic valve <b>2</b>′ or optionally directly through port <b>2</b> in cylinder head at valve <b>2</b>′ with valve <b>2</b>′ (shown in phantom) optionally being absent.</p>
  <p num="p-0294">The supplementary, supercharging air charge for mode 2 and mode 3 in this design is compressed and cooled from conduits <b>113</b>′ and <b>114</b>′ of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref> or alternatively, compressed and chilled from conduit <b>27</b>′<i>a</i>, as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-B</figref>, is injected into the cylinder <b>12</b> by inlet valve <b>16</b>-A, (after cylinder scavenging and charging and ports <b>11</b> are closed by piston <b>22</b>), and by conduit <b>17</b>-A and inlet port(s) <b>17</b>-B, which optionally can be one or many, and located in cylinder wall <b>12</b> at any place deemed proper for best mixing of charge.

  <heading>Dual Air Pressure Levels Supplied by Pressure Amplifier</heading> <p num="p-0303">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, (System A), there is shown a schematic view of a six cylinder engine, 4-stroke or 2 stroke, having both low and high-pressure charge air supplied by one or two initial stages of compression. The pressure in one line, <b>9</b>′ is being amplified by a pressure amplifier and illustrates how one compressor <b>5</b> and a pressure amplifier <b>2</b> can supply either low or low boosted, and high-pressure air for operation of the new cycle engine or a constant speed engine, such as for power generation, pumping, etc. This pressure amplifier system may be used for any other appropriate need for high pressure gas or other fluids.

  <p num="p-0307">In the amplifier <b>2</b>, the larger piston <b>7</b> with the greater piston face surface is depressed by the expanding air entering valve <b>14</b> from compressor <b>5</b>. Now, a second portion of the compressed air enters valve <b>4</b> to the smaller piston, which further compresses by pressure exerted by larger face <b>7</b> of piston <b>2</b>, and expels the second high-pressure part of the charge through valve <b>10</b> into conduit and cooler <b>9</b> or, wholly or partly, through bypass <b>34</b> and valve <b>35</b>, or partly through each, where the temperature is adjusted to needed temperature for the manifold <b>12</b> to supply high-pressure air inlet valve <b>16</b>-A of engine of FIG. <b>11</b>. The low-pressure air charge also passes through a cooler or heater <b>11</b>′ or, in whole or part, bypass system <b>34</b>′ and <b>35</b>′ and to manifold <b>13</b> and then to low pressure inlet valves <b>16</b>-B of engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> or alternatively, to ports <b>11</b> of 2-stroke engine of FIG. <b>8</b>.

  <heading>Dual Chilled High-Pressure Air and Low Pressure Air Supply</heading> <p num="p-0308">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11-B</figref>, (System B) there is shown a schematic view of a six cylinder engine, 4-stroke or 2-stroke, having both low and high-pressure charge air supplied by one or two stages of pre-compression. The pressure to one line <b>9</b>′ is being amplified by a pressure amplifier <b>2</b> and illustrates how one compressor <b>5</b> and a pressure amplifier <b>2</b> can supply either low or low boosted, and high pressure air, for operation of a constant speed engine of this invention such as for power generation, pumping, etc. The compressor-cooler system of the present engine invention is not limited to any particular type of compressor or cooler system.</p>
  <p num="p-0309">The 4-stroke and 2-stroke engines of this invention require a supply of air or air-fuel charge presented to the engine <b>1</b>′ of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> or <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11-B</figref> or alternatively, to 2-stroke engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, at two different pressure levels and generally at different temperatures, with the capability of expansion chilling the high pressure charge air.

  <heading>Otto and Diesel Cycle Engines</heading> <p num="p-0312">For <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-D</figref>, current technology 2-stroke and 4-stroke Otto and Diesel Cycle engines, the high-pressure cooled or chilled dense air or air-fuel input to intake valves <b>16</b>-A would be utilized for performance improvements. The low-pressure output of the pressure amplifier could be returned to suction side of compressor <b>1</b> or compressor <b>2</b> and would be mandatory if fuel is premixed with the air.</p>
  <p num="p-0313">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, there is shown a pressure-volume diagram (which is a compilation of 4 diagrams) for a high-speed Diesel engine, compared to the engines of this invention, showing three stages intercooled compression and a fourth stage of uncooled compression, which arrangement is suggested for optimum power and efficiency for the engine of this invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0314">Note 1—In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the travel distance of the line for engine B on the horizontal coordinate, indicates the theoretical volume at the greater density. The density is kept at that level at the actual combustion chamber volume (as shown by dashed line V) regardless of the density, by pumping in more charge at the backside.</p>
  <p num="p-0315">There are several features that improve the thermal efficiency of the engine of this invention. Greater power to weight ratios will provide a smaller engine with less frictional losses. Increased torque allows much lower RPM, again reducing frictional loses. The extended expansion ratio results in higher thermodynamic efficiency cycle, which is shown in theoretical considerations. There are also definite efficiency gains in a “staged” compression process, even with external compressors with associated piping, intercoolers and aftercoolers, etc. There is a very significant energy savings when air is compressed in intercooled stages. Less energy is used in compressing a charge to 500 psi in 2, 3 or 4 intercooled stages than is used to compress the hot charge to the same 500 psi in a conventional engine. A normal engine uses approximately 20% of its own energy produced to compress its own air charge. Calculations show a significant energy savings in an engine, if the air is compressed in aftercooled stages. Compressing a charge in only two stages to 531 psi (a 13:1 compression ratio) reduces the energy used by 15.8% over compressing to the same 531 psi level in a single stage, as does the Otto and the Diesel Cycle engines. Three stages of intercooled compression raises the savings to 18%. This is the ideal. Degradation from the ideal should not exceed 25%, which leaves a 13.5% energy savings. This 13.5% energy savings times the 20% of a normal engine's power used for compressing its own charge, is a 2.7% net efficiency improvement by the compression process alone. This is one of the advantages of the engine of this invention, which adds to the other thermal efficiency improvements. The dense charge, along with the large expansion ratio (the latter is several designs) provide improvements in fuel efficiency, greater torque, power and durability, while lowering polluting emissions.</p>
  <heading>Air Bypass Valve (ABV) Control Operation</heading> <p num="p-0316">An engine control module (ECM) <b>27</b> controls the air cooler bypass valves <b>3</b> and <b>5</b>. The bypass valves may be a shutter type valve as illustrated to pass part, all or none of the air charge in either direction, or valves <b>3</b> and <b>5</b> may be of a helical solenoid or other type of valve which can pass part or all of the air charge through bypass conduits <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> and part or all through air coolers <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> for fine control of the temperature and density of the air charge. The ECM receives signals from sensors, such as an engine coolant sensor, a crankshaft position sensor, camshaft position sensor, a manifold absolute pressure sensor, a heated oxygen sensor and pressure and temperature sensors, the latter two preferably placed in the combustion chamber.</p>
  <p num="p-0317">To provide optimum air charging pressure for differing engine operating conditions, the ECM-<b>27</b> sends signals to control air bypass valves <b>4</b> and <b>6</b>. These valves could be on-off solenoid valves, possibly vacuum operated, or they could be helical solenoids or other type of valve, which could remain closed or open part way or all the way in order to optionally re-circulate, part or all, of the air charge back through the inlets <b>110</b> and <b>8</b> of compressors <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> in order to optionally reduce or eliminate entirely the pumping pressure of either compressor <b>1</b> or compressor <b>2</b>, or both. Similar arrangements of air pressure control could be used for additional stages of air compression, if additional stages are used.</p>
  <p num="p-0318">The operation is thus: The ABV valves <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> is controlled by signals from the ECM-<b>27</b> to control the angle of valves <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> to provide the optimum air charging pressures for various engine loads and duty cycles. When ABV <b>6</b> is opened partially, some of the air pumped through compressor <b>2</b> is passed back into the intake <b>8</b> of compressor <b>2</b> to reduce compression pressure. When ABV <b>6</b> is opened fully, all of the charge of compressor <b>2</b> is passed back through compressor <b>2</b>. Thus, compressor <b>2</b>, valves <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> and ECM-<b>27</b> can exert fine control of charge air density.</p>
  <p num="p-0319">With this arrangement, combined with the arrangement of ECM-<b>27</b>, control of charge-air cooler bypass system for variable valves <b>3</b> and <b>5</b>, and in the optional design of <b>11</b>-B, the variable expansion valve <b>10</b>′, the temperature, density, pressure and turbulence of the charge-air can be managed to produce the desired power and torque levels and emissions characteristics in the power cylinder of the engine.</p>
  <p num="p-0320">Engine conditions that could be monitored by ECM-<b>27</b> in order to affect proper engine conditions, in regard to control of ABV valves <b>4</b> and <b>6</b>, could include a fuel injection activity sensor, air temperature sensor at various points, manifold absolute pressure sensor, a heated oxygen sensor and/or other sensory inputs known to be used in internal combustion engines. The ECM-<b>27</b> controls both the shutter valves <b>3</b> and <b>5</b> and the air bypass valves <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> in order to maintain the optimum air charging density pressure and temperature at all engine operating duty cycles.</p>
  <heading>Alternate Combustion Systems</heading> <p num="p-0321">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, there is shown a schematic transverse view of a pre-combustion chamber <b>38</b>′, a combustion chamber <b>38</b>, a piston <b>22</b> and associated fuel inlet <b>36</b>, a sparking or glow plug <b>37</b>, an air or air/fuel mixture inlet duct <b>8</b>′ intake valve <b>20</b>, an exhaust duct <b>18</b>′ an exhaust valve <b>17</b>, suggested for liquid or gaseous fuel operation for the engines of this invention or for any other internal combustion engine.</p>
  <p num="p-0322">There are many choices of systems for compression or spark ignition for the engine of this invention, as described in FIG. <b>1</b> and FIG. <b>2</b>. Every fuel from gasoline to heavy diesel fuels, including the alcohols and gaseous fuels can be spark ignited or compression ignited (CI) in this engine, as well as by HCCI. One good system would be similar to the system shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> or <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> for compressed natural gas, propane, hydrogen, gasoline, alcohols or diesel fuel. In this system, an extremely fuel rich mixture constituting the entire fuel charge is, preferably, injected into the pre-combustion chamber <b>38</b>′. The fuel could be injected through fuel duct <b>36</b> with or without accompanying heated or cool re-circulated exhaust gases or air. The air charge, some of which can accompany the fuel charge, would be compressed into the pre-combustion chamber <b>38</b>′ by piston <b>22</b> during the compression stroke. Additional air, with or without additional fuel, could be introduced into the cylinder proper on the compression stroke through intake conduit <b>8</b>′. In either case, the second combustion stage in the cylinder proper would be with a lean mixture. The two-stage combustion system shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> will operate in this manner</p>
  <heading>Pre-Combustion (First Stage)</heading> <p num="p-0323">Pre-combustion occurs in the pre-combustion chamber <b>38</b>′ when fuel, in an amount much in excess of the amount of oxygen present, is injected through conduit <b>36</b> and ignited (injector not shown). This oxygen deficiency, along with the cooler, turbulent charge and lower peak temperatures and pressures, greatly reduces the formation of oxides of nitrogen. The combination of the hot pre-combustion chamber wall and intense turbulence promotes more complete combustion.</p>
  <heading>Post-Combustion (Second Stage</heading> <p num="p-0324">Post-combustion takes place at lower pressure and relatively low temperature conditions in the space above the piston in the cylinder as the gases expand from the first stage pre-combustion chamber into the cylinder proper. If there is additional fuel in the cylinder proper, the leaner mixture is ignited by this plasma-like blast from the pre-combustion chamber. The low temperature and the admixture of burned gases prevent any further formation of oxides of nitrogen. Excess air, a strong turbulent action, and the extended expansion process assure more complete combustion of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and carbon.</p>
  <p num="p-0325">The results of the engine of this invention, using the pre-combustion chamber <b>38</b>′ of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, are: higher thermal efficiencies due to the greater expansion and a denser charge, along with a cooler exhaust and a lower level of polluting emissions, including oxides of nitrogen, and in addition, lower aromatics and particulates for diesel fuels.</p>
  <heading>Variable Compression Ratio and Double Power Designs</heading> <p num="p-0326">In following arrangements, there is shown schematic transverse sectional views of two optional cylinder designs of the engine of this invention which will convert the 2-stroke engine of FIG. <b>8</b> through <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> or any other 2-stroke engine to a one power stroke per piston stroke engine, and will convert the 4-stroke engines of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to FIG. <b>5</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> or any other 4-stroke engine to operate as a 1 power stroke per cycle engine.</p>
  <p num="p-0327">By building any 2-stroke engine with all power cylinders double acting, the power to weight ratio can be doubled over the basic engine. One end of the cylinder fires and the other end is scavenged and charged on each piston stroke for a “nominal” one power stroke for each piston stroke (or two power strokes for each shaft rotation) of the engines of FIG. <b>8</b> through FIG. <b>10</b>. Use of double-acting power cylinders in the 4-stroke engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> converts the engine to a 1 power stroke per shaft rotation engine because two of the functions of a 4-stroke cycle engine are accomplished on each stroke of the piston.</p>
  <p num="p-0328">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, there is shown a double-acting cylinder with a means of varying beam <b>39</b> length to vary the compression ratio, which is accomplished by the beam end forming a scotch yoke <b>40</b> and fitting over the wrist pin <b>41</b> of the piston.</p>
  <p num="p-0329">The double-ended piston <b>22</b>″ can be linked to the end of a vertical beam <b>39</b> that pivots at the lower end <b>42</b>. A connecting rod <b>19</b>′ is joined between the midpoint of the beam and the crankshaft <b>20</b>′.</p>
  <p num="p-0330">Since the crankshaft <b>20</b>′ does no more than transmit torque, its main bearings will be very lightly loaded. As a result, little noise will reach the supporting casing. Because of the lever action, the crank (not shown) has half the throw of the piston stroke and can be a stubby, cam-like unit with large, closely spaced pins having substantial overlap for strength.</p>
  <p num="p-0331">The compression ratio can be changed by slightly lengthening or shortening the effective length of the beam <b>39</b>. This can be done by the lower pivot plate <b>42</b> being attached to a block <b>43</b>, mounted slidably in a fixed block <b>44</b>, in which block <b>43</b> can be moved slidably by a servo motor <b>45</b>. The gear <b>45</b> <i>a </i>rotated by servo motor <b>45</b> is much longer than the gear <b>44</b> <i>a </i>on the screw <b>43</b> <i>b</i>, which is rotatably attached to block <b>43</b> and rotates against threads in block <b>44</b>, causing gear <b>44</b> <i>a </i>to slide back and forth on gear <b>45</b> <i>a</i>, as block <b>43</b> reciprocates in block <b>44</b>. Thus, as a diesel, it could be started at 20:1 ratio and then shifted to a 13:1 ratio for higher efficiency and for less friction and stress on parts. This could also be important to allow use of alternate fuels.</p>
  <p num="p-0332">Referring now to FIG. <b>15</b>. This same advantage holds true for this alternate design in which the pivot <b>47</b>′ is between the connecting rod <b>19</b> and the piston <b>22</b>″.</p>
  <p num="p-0333">The needed variation of the length of the beam <b>39</b> (shown in phantom), connecting the piston <b>22</b>″ to the connecting rod <b>19</b>, can be accomplished by forming a scotch yoke <b>40</b> on the beam end fitting over the wrist-pin <b>41</b> of the piston <b>22</b>″, or by placing a double pivoting link <b>42</b>′ between the pivot <b>47</b>′ on the fulcrum of beam <b>39</b>′, with the pivot <b>42</b>″ being attached to a non-movable pan <b>46</b> of the engine and the terminal end of beam <b>39</b>′ being connected to connecting rod <b>19</b> by a pin <b>47</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0334">Alternatively and preferably, for heavy duty engines (marine propulsion, power production, etc.) the power take off of piston <b>22</b>″ could be with a conventional piston rod <b>39</b>′ being arranged between piston <b>22</b>″ and a crosshead <b>20</b>′, with a connecting rod <b>19</b>′ between the crosshead <b>20</b>′ and the crankshaft (not shown).</p>
  <p num="p-0335">Double-acting power cylinders when used in the engine of this invention, or any other engine, will be especially important where great power is desired and cooling water is readily available, e.g., for marine use or for power generation. These double-ended, double-acting cylinders of the engine of FIG. <b>14</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> can be used in all of the designs of this invention, or in any Otto or Diesel engine.</p>
  <heading>Double Burn “Dwell” Time</heading> <p num="p-0336">Referring now to FIG. <b>16</b>. There is shown a schematic transverse sectional view of a crankshaft, two connecting rods <b>19</b>′ and <b>19</b>″ and a beam <b>39</b> showing a means of providing extra loading and burn “Dwell” time at TDC of a conventional 2-stroke or 4-stroke engine and especially for the engine designs of the present invention, namely <b>4</b> stroke engines of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 7</figref> and FIGS. <b>18</b> through <b>19</b>-B. The system of Double Burn Time of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is also important in 2-stroke engines of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 through 10</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0337">This layout for any engine provides for double the piston <b>22</b> turnaround time of a normal engine during the critical bum period. This is because piston <b>22</b> TDC occurs at BDC of the crank <b>48</b>. At this point, crank pin motion around piston <b>22</b> is subtracted from the straightening movement of the connecting rod <b>19</b>′, instead of being added to it, as in conventional engines. Reversing the usual action slows piston travel around this point, resulting in more complete combustion and further reducing emissions. This system allows more complete fuel burn and heat energy conversion into peak pressure before the power stroke begins. This enhances power per unit of fuel consumption and brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), and reduces polluting emissions. It also allows the engine to operate under lean burn conditions.</p>
  <p num="p-0338">The extra burn time, provided by the design of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, can be important in the engines of this invention and to any Otto or Diesel cycle engine.</p>
  <p num="p-0339">Operation of the engine, constructed and arranged with the additional burning time, would be the same as the other engines of this invention, providing high charge density, low compression-ratios in some designs, with a mean effective pressure higher than conventional engines, but with more combustion time than other engines, while producing even less polluting emissions.</p>
  <p num="p-0340">Since the crankshaft <b>48</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> does no more than transmit torque, its main bearings will be very lightly loaded. As a result, little noise will reach the supporting casing. Because of the lever action, the crank can have as little as half the throw of the piston stroke (depending on the point of the fulcrum), and can be a stubby, cam-like unit with large, closely spaced pins having substantial overlap for strength. This layout provides for twice the combustion time of the engine of this invention during the critical loading and burn period. This is because piston TDC occurs at BDC of the crank.</p>

  <heading>Brief Description of Operational Designs 11 and 12</heading> <p num="p-0348">Operational Design 11, FIG. <b>18</b>. The engine is similar in structure to the 4-stroke engine of FIG. <b>2</b> and shows an alternative air compression system utilizing air intake <b>8</b> (in phantom) or air intake <b>8</b>′. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> also shows four intercoolers <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>′, <b>11</b>, and <b>12</b>, and dual manifolds <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>. The alternate air induction system <b>8</b>′ shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> supplies unpressurized charge-air to low pressure intake valves <b>16</b>-B of the engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> by providing atmospheric pressure air to the intake runners <b>32</b>′ and <b>32</b>″ and to intake valves <b>16</b>-B of each power cylinder. Optionally, a second air induction system also shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> where air inlet <b>8</b> inlets atmospheric air to a turbo-charger <b>1</b> and cooler system <b>10</b> (all in phantom) to boost the pressure and cool the initial charge that is then directed optionally to conduit <b>32</b> and low pressure intake valves <b>16</b>-B where the charge is received compressed while expelling a large portion of the charge into compressing and cooling system, compressor <b>2</b> and intercoolers <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> and is then admitted to the inlet valve <b>16</b>-A of power cylinders <b>22</b> after piston <b>22</b> has passed point “E” in the last part of the power stroke.</p>
  <heading>Operation</heading> <p num="p-0349">In this concept, air at atmospheric pressure (from inlet <b>8</b>′), or pressure boosted by compressor <b>1</b> and cooled by intercooler <b>10</b> and through conduit <b>32</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, is received by the intake (1<sup>st</sup>) stroke of piston <b>22</b> through intake valve <b>16</b>-B and then piston <b>22</b> turns around and the compression (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke begins. Then, during the compression (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke, much of the total charge, now being compressed, is expelled (this is part A of charge) through outlet valve <b>16</b>-C (indicated, but not shown) which quickly opens and closes at piston position E into a compression-cooling circuit system consisting of conduits <b>201</b>, <b>202</b>, intercooler <b>10</b>′, compressor <b>2</b>, bypass system <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, intercoolers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, to manifolds <b>13</b>-<b>14</b>, conduits <b>15</b>-A, later to be injected by high-pressure intake valves <b>16</b>-A. That portion of the air charge (part A) is now further compressed and cooled with pressure buildup in manifolds <b>13</b>-<b>14</b>. (The compression stroke of piston <b>22</b> continues toward TDC, now compressing part B of the charge, that remaining in cylinder <b>7</b> after piston <b>22</b> passes point E and valve <b>16</b>-C has opened and closed). The cool dense A charge, now accumulated in the compression-cooling circuit, is then re-injected through high-pressure intake valve <b>16</b>-A above piston <b>22</b> crown after piston <b>22</b> has reached or passed the point (E) during the compression stroke and can be injected as late as during combustion. The charge A has been injected, cylinder compression of the now total air charge (B that remaining in cylinder after passing point E plus A, the injected portion.) continues, which is Operational Design 11. Near TDC of piston <b>22</b>, fuel is added, if not present, and the charge is ignited for the power (3<sup>rd</sup>) stroke followed by the scavenging (4<sup>th</sup>) stroke, as exhaust valve <b>17</b> opens, and another power cycle begins. This produces a denser extended expansion ratio charge with great power, low fuel consumption and low emissions.</p>
  <p num="p-0350">The compression ratio of the cylinder is alternatively much greater (with, of course, much smaller combustion chamber compared to the volume of cylinder <b>7</b>) due to the necessity of retaining the improved density of the charge. The latter is allowed by the lower heat-of-compression allowed by the low “effective” compression ratio of both A and B portions of charge air or fuel-air. The charge portion A, which is highly compressed and cooled before re-injecting and igniting, has an “effective” compression ratio which can be as low as 2:1 to 5:1 for very low heat-of-compression and producing ultra low polluting emissions, especially NO<sub>X</sub>. This is also true for portion B of charge.</p>
  <p num="p-0351">In this Operational Design (11), although the “effective” compression is extremely low, the actual compression ratio, which is very high, equals the expansion ratio, with much improved power and efficiency per unit of fuel-air charge.</p>
  <p num="p-0352">The system optionally operates in this fashion: The cylinder <b>7</b> has, say, an expansion ratio of 20:1 and the “effective” compression ratio is much less. Consider that the cylinder has a compression ratio of 20:1, at two-thirds of piston <b>22</b> stroke distance (point E), outlet valve <b>16</b>-C opens to expel air charge A at a low compression state since there is a pressure blow-down due to suction of compressor <b>2</b> which receives the expelled portion (A) of the charge. Piston <b>22</b> continues the compression stroke on B, the remainder of the charge, producing about a 5:1 “effective” compression ratio on B, the portion of charge remaining in the cylinder. The charge A received by the compressor <b>2</b>, which is pre-cooled by intercooler <b>10</b>′, is highly compressed now and again cooled by intercoolers <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>. This cool, dense charge is, after pressure build-up, re-injected into cylinder <b>7</b> above piston <b>22</b> after the piston has passed point E in which outlet valve <b>16</b>-C has closed and can be as late as TDC. Therefore, piston <b>22</b> is compressing the B portion of charge, that remaining in cylinder after expulsion of a portion A of charge through outlet valve <b>16</b>-C. The “effective” compression ratio of that portion is as stated, perhaps about 5:1. The highly compressed cool charge A re-injected could have an “effective” compression ratio of less than 4:1 since the distance from injection (after point E) to TDC is perhaps only 30% of piston travel distance. The total charge (A+B) then ignited near TDC to produce the power stroke, is cool, very dense and has an “effective” compression ratio of about 5:1 or less. Yet, piston <b>22</b> is depressed in the power stroke with the density of, and the expansion ratio of a 20:1 to 40:1 combustion ratio engine, depending on the volume of the combustion chamber. This system produces a more dense charge than does a 10:1 compression ratio engine, but with much superior power and efficiency with very low polluting emissions including particulates. This system also eliminates problems with spark-knock and pre-ignition. Fuel-air mixes can be used with diesel oils with spark ignition or HCCI operations.</p>
  <p num="p-0353">Operational Design 11-B, FIG. <b>18</b>: As in Operational. Design 11, atmospheric or pressure boosted air (the latter cooled by intercooler <b>10</b>) is received by cylinder <b>7</b>, by intake valve <b>16</b>-B during intake (1<sup>st</sup>) stroke of piston <b>22</b>. At BDC, valve <b>16</b>-B closes. Then, compression (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke begins. Ancillary valve <b>16</b>-C, which is alternatively automatic, opens quickly during the compression (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke near piston TDC with nearly all of the compressed charge being expelled into a cooling circuit (like that described for Design 11.) Outlet valve <b>16</b>-C is then closed. At the same time, high pressure intake valve <b>16</b>-A opens (after valve <b>16</b>-C closes) and temperature adjusted cooled air, which has been building in pressure by rotating the crank shaft or is stored and is cool and stored in the compression cooling circuit, is now injected into combustion chamber <b>7</b>′ near end of compression stroke TDC. Intake valve <b>16</b>-A now closes. Fuel is added, if not present, and the charge is ignited at or near TDC and the power (3<sup>rd</sup>) stroke occurs, followed by the scavenging (4<sup>th</sup>) stroke, as exhaust valve <b>17</b> opens and another power cycle is complete. The effective compression ratio in this Design is near zero, perhaps 2:1 or less for extremely low heat-of-compression, thus providing ultra low polluting emissions, but with power and low fuel consumption.</p>
  <p num="p-0354">Shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is the compression and cooling system and a suggested engine control system, all consisting of an engine control module (ECM) <b>27</b>, two shutter valves <b>3</b> and <b>5</b>, two air bypass valves <b>4</b> and <b>6</b>, four intercoolers <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>′, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, two compressors <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> and a scheme of controlling the pressure, temperature and density by controlling air bypass valves <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> and shutter valves <b>3</b> and <b>5</b> and intake valves <b>16</b>-B and <b>16</b>-A and exhaust valve <b>17</b> (not shown.)

  <heading>Ultra Low Emissions Engine Operating in Operational Design 12</heading> <p num="p-0358">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18-B</figref>, there is shown a schematic drawing of a six-cylinder engine <b>100</b> <sup>18-B </sup>operating in a 4-stroke cycle engine. The engine, which is depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18-B</figref>, is similar in structure to the 4-stroke engine of FIG. <b>18</b>. It can be operated in system of Design 11 or Design 11-B, as desired. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18-B</figref> shows that it has a variant alternative, enhanced air cooling system useful for providing compression-expansion chilled engine charge air or air-fuel mix. It further shows two air compressors <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, four intercoolers <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>′, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, with controls to alter charge density and temperature, each separate from the others, controlled by ECM-<b>27</b>.

Additional benefits are having broader control of pressure and temperature of both portions of the air charges.

If the air charge contains fuel, the discharged air-fuel charge through outlet valve <b>16</b>-D is directed by conduit <b>16</b>-DC to conduit <b>16</b>-DC<b>2</b> which goes alternatively to A) suction side of turbo-charger, to B) suction conduit <b>105</b> or to C) intake port <b>8</b>′ of conduit <b>32</b>″-<b>32</b>′.

The hollow arrow in conduit <b>120</b> shows how air bypass valve <b>4</b> can be partially opened to allow some of the air to bypass and return in order to finely adjust the pressure of the super-compressed air charge that is injected to adjust the charge density, temperature and perhaps a stoicheometric air fuel mixture.

In the 2-stroke engine, the primary air charge used generally comes through ports <b>11</b> in the wall of cylinder <b>12</b>. The valving is by ports <b>11</b> being closed and opened by piston <b>22</b>. In 4-stroke engines, the primary air charge comes from intake valve <b>16</b>-B. In both 2-stroke and 4-stroke engines, the supplementary air charge generally comes through intake valve <b>16</b>-A.</p>
  <p num="p-0378">For engines designed for HCCI operations using Methods A through G and engine Operational Designs 1 through 13, as depicted and described herein, for the present invention, are recommended.</p>

  <p num="p-0380">Description of subsequent Methods, A through G of HCCI operation will be limited almost entirely to the methods of control of charge density, temperatures and the means and timing of charge ignition, with reliance on the instructions for operating the engine as being explicit in the instructions and suggestions for the HCCI methods and also with reliance on references to the various engine designs and their corresponding Engine Operational Designs.</p>
  <p num="p-0381">The spark ignition operation of any of the Operational Designs requires similar control of charge density, temperature and ignition timing with much less stringent control of temperatures, the most important being that the temperature of the fuel-air mix must be lower than auto-ignition until the point of ignition, with ignition generally occurring a few degrees before piston TDC. The chief advantage of this system of spark ignition being that low auto-ignition fuels like diesel oils can selectively be compressed to a much denser and more powerful charge, although already mixed with air, than that of the Diesel cycle engine, while also eliminating pre-mixed burning. The latter is the cause of diesel smoke and and smaller particulates. In addition, this system of keeping the combustion and peak temperatures low greatly reduces or eliminates NO<sub>X </sub>and some other polluting emissions.</p>

      <li id="ul0013-0004" num="0488">Design 4: The exhaust valve stays open during the compression stroke to near piston TDC, expelling most of the fresh primary charge from cylinder <b>7</b> or <b>22</b> (FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>10</b>), which is to cool both chambers <b>38</b>′ and/or <b>38</b> and to produce an “effective” compression ratio of perhaps 2:1 or less with an extended expansion ratio. At near piston TDC, the entire working charge is injected. This produces an “effective” ratio of 2:1 to zero.</li>
    </ul> <p num="p-0391">In all cases, a supplementary cool, dense air charge is injected, preferably late, during the compression (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke. At piston TDC, the charge is ignited for the power (3<sup>rd</sup>) stroke, followed by the scavenging (4<sup>th</sup>) stroke to complete a power cycle.</p>
  <heading>Method A, Detailed Operation</heading> <p num="p-0392">Piston <b>22</b> has just completed the scavenging (4<sup>th</sup>) stroke and is at TDC. Intake valve <b>16</b>-B opens as piston <b>22</b> begins the intake (1<sup>st</sup>) stroke, taking in our atmospheric or pressure boosted and cooled air or air-fuel charge. Piston <b>22</b> reverses and with insulated valve <b>21</b> closed to temporarily prevent flammable air-fuel propulsion charge entering pre-combustion chamber <b>38</b>′ prematurely, piston <b>22</b> begins and continues the compression (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke toward TDC. (The primary air-fuel charge would optionally produce a sub-standard or sub-normal compression ratio charge for low heat-of-compression for that portion of the charge).</p>
  <p num="p-0393">During the compression (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke a supplemental, supercharging, highly compressed, dense, temperature-adjusted air charge is injected into cylinder <b>7</b> above piston <b>22</b>. The supplemental, secondary air charge can be added at any point after the port intake valve <b>16</b>-B closes on the intake (1<sup>st</sup>) stroke and can be as late as during charge combustion. The supplemental, secondary charge can be injected at such point in the compression stroke that it will also have a very low compression ratio in all Operational Designs, again for very low heat-of-compression. In addition, the supplemental, secondary air charge can be either a major or minor portion of the entire air-fuel charge versus the primary charge which has the same capabilities. (Sensors in chamber <b>38</b>′ have signaled ECM-<b>27</b> information which it uses to use control valves <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> and optionally valve <b>10</b>′, including the heat-of-compression to adjust charge temperatures near piston TDC to be just below auto-ignition temperature. Compression continues until piston is very near TDC. At that point, blocking valve <b>21</b> opens quickly and receives the compressed fuel-air propulsion charge being compressed into chamber <b>38</b>′. Heating elements <b>37</b> and/or <b>39</b> plus the heat-of-compression raise the temperature of the fuel-air mix above the auto-ignition of the fuel, causing the charge to begin oxidation. (If the temperature in pre-combustion can be controlled sufficiently, blocking valve <b>21</b> may be eliminated.) The hot swirling charge expands past valve <b>21</b> into combustion chamber <b>38</b>, catalyzing the rapid oxidation of the entire fuel-air charge. The expanding charge depresses piston <b>22</b>, or rotor <b>2</b> or <b>2</b>-B, into the power (3<sup>rd</sup>) stroke. At BDC, piston <b>22</b> reverses and scavenges the cylinder with (4<sup>th</sup>) stroke in preparation for another working cycle. This completes one power cycle of the engine.</p>
  <p num="p-0394">The preferred method of operation is for the primary air charge to be boosted in pressure. All Operational Designs, except Design 1 and Design 2, have selectively extended expansion ratios, with low effective compression ratios. When operating in HCCI methods, valve <b>21</b>, opening to preparation chamber <b>38</b>′, may stay open through the piston power (3<sup>rd</sup>) stroke, the exhaust (4<sup>th</sup>) stroke and the piston (1<sup>st</sup>) stroke, closing at the start of the start of the compression (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke. Should proper HCCI temperatures be controllable or spark ignition be employed, valve <b>21</b> may be eliminated.</p>
  <p num="p-0395">Note that in Operational Design 4, the cool primary charge is expelled through valve <b>16</b>-C (not shown) which can open into chamber <b>38</b> or <b>38</b>′ or through exhaust valve <b>17</b> and is used only to cool chambers <b>38</b> and <b>38</b>′ after which the expelled charge is returned, if fuel is present, to suction conduit <b>110</b> of compressor <b>2</b> or to suction port <b>8</b>′ of FIG. <b>2</b>.

The compression (2<sup>nd</sup>) stoke of piston <b>22</b> nears completion and the propulsion air-fuel charge is now compressed above piston <b>22</b> and fills combustion chamber <b>38</b> and/or preparation chamber <b>38</b>′.</p>

  <p num="p-0398">Alternatively, for non-flammable gas, valve <b>40</b> on conduit <b>36</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19-B</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19-C</figref>, which can be close to pre-combustion chamber <b>38</b>′, can be kept closed to restrain the hot gas until piston <b>22</b> nears TDC in the compression stroke, preferably at 10-15 degrees before piston TDC.

The hot gas instantly raises the temperature of the air-fuel mix in the pre-combustion chamber <b>38</b>′ catalyzing the ignition whereby the burning mixture expands into the combustion chamber <b>38</b>, catalyzing and further oxidizing the entire charge.</p>
  <p num="p-0399">Alternatively, the gases can originate from conduit <b>203</b> <i>i</i>, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-C</figref> from exhaust, from a mixture of hot exhaust and air or any other appropriate gas. The gas is compressed by compressor <b>2</b>′, if necessary, or any other type compressor.

The hot gases can be mixed with engine fuel within pre-combustion chamber <b>38</b>′, ignited and expanded into combustion chamber <b>38</b> as described in number <b>3</b> above.</p>
  <heading>Direct Combustion Chamber Ignition</heading> <p num="p-0400">Alternatively, pre-combustion chamber <b>38</b>′ is eliminated in this system and for HCCI.

A valve <b>40</b> on conduit <b>36</b> opens and closes quickly at perhaps 10-15 degrees, before piston TDC, to inject the compressed hot gases directly into the turbulent air-fuel charge in combustion chamber <b>38</b>. As stated, these hot gases can be a portion of the engines high-pressure supplemental, secondary air charge (without fuel) with the heat-of-compression retained and heated or cooled, if needed, or they can be re-circulated hot or heated exhaust gases, heated air or a mixture thereof from conduit <b>36</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19-B</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19-C</figref>. When the hot gases enter combustion chamber <b>38</b>, they disperse throughout the charge, raising the temperature of the fuel-air charge above the auto-ignition temperature of the charge, catalyzing the ignition of the charge which then expands driving the piston. Any compressed hot, flammable or non-flammable gas would be a good catalyst for low auto-ignition fuels, such as gasoline or diesel fuel. If diesel propulsion fuel were used, the New Cycle Engines of this invention would compact the air-fuel charge to a far greater density than would a current diesel engine with the air-fuel charge temperature being lower than the auto-ignition temperature of diesel oils-air mixture. (Diesel oil-air mix would auto-ignite at a compression ratio of about 8:1 in any normal diesel or current technology HCCI engine, reducing power and efficiency. As already stated, compressed natural gas, with or without air, should be a good pilot fuel for diesel oil fuels, but preferably without being mixed with air.</p>
  <p num="p-0401">Optionally, the hot gases may be injected into either preparation chamber <b>38</b>′ or combustion chamber <b>38</b> from two or more injection lines.

This is because smoke in Diesel engines is caused by pre-mixed burning and in this system the air and fuel are a homogeneous mixture.

  <p num="p-0403">A good system of supplying hot gases for catalyzing ignition in any of the engines of this invention is depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-C</figref>.

  <heading>Method C—Modified HCCI, Operational Design 16 Flammable Fluid (Gas or Liquid) Pilot Fuel</heading> <p num="p-0413">The air intake (1<sup>st</sup>) stroke, the compression (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke has occurred and the supplementary air-fuel charge has been injected. With the air-fuel propulsion charge homogenized and the temperature of the mix when compressed at near piston TDC being adjusted to near auto-ignition temperature, with combustion chamber <b>38</b>, <b>38</b>-B and preparation chamber <b>38</b>′ or <b>38</b>′B filled with propulsion fuel above piston <b>22</b>, the system works in this manner: The fuel air charge is ignited by (a) spark as in conventional engines and (b) for HCCI operation. Conduit <b>41</b> with fuel injector <b>42</b> (both in phantom), receives and contains pilot fuel or air-fuel mix, perhaps from a common fuel-rail, which can be any liquid or flammable gaseous product, such as CNG-air mix, dimethyl ether-air mix or preferably CNG or pilot fuel or dimethyl ether alone. All would be appropriate as pilot fuel for diesel-air propulsion fuel, as all have a higher auto-ignition temperature than does diesel oil-air mix. Both natural gas and dimethyl ether can be heated to an even higher temperature, if injected devoid of air.</p>
  <p num="p-0414">At near completion of compression (2<sup>nd</sup>) stroke and near TDC of piston (preferably 10-15 degrees before), a small amount of heated pilot fuel in line <b>41</b>, with temperature adjusted to above auto-ignition temperature of the propulsion fuel-air mix, but below auto-ignition of the pilot fuel, is injected by fuel injection pump <b>42</b> into preparation chamber <b>38</b>′, the fuel injected having been further heated, if needed, by heater <b>37</b> and/or <b>39</b>′ or by a heater of any type. (such as <b>108</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-C</figref> and <b>116</b>′ in FIGS. <b>2</b> through <b>2</b>-D and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17</figref>, <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>-B and <b>18</b>-C). This higher temperature pilot fuel then ignites the small quantity of propulsion fuel by raising its temperature in chamber <b>38</b>′ which then, in turn, ignites the pilot fuel and together expands into combustion chamber <b>38</b>, raising the temperature of the air-fuel propulsion mix, instantly catalyzing the reaction by quickly raising the temperature to above auto-ignition level. In the compact combustion chamber, with the fuel-air premixed (homogenized) and with the turbulence of the new engine system, the combustion will be far more complete than in a compression ignited (CI) engine where much of the fuel burns prior to mixing. The expanding charge drives piston <b>22</b> in the power (3<sup>rd</sup>) stroke which is followed by the scavenging (4<sup>th</sup>) stroke of piston <b>22</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0415">An ideal hot flammable gas for igniting low ignition fuels would appear to be natural gas, sans air, which can be heated to temperatures higher than the auto-ignition temperature of pure gasoline or diesel oils or other low auto-ignition fuels. When injected into gasoline or diesel oil and air mixtures, the higher temperature natural gas will ignite the lower auto-igniting gasoline or diesel oil and air mixture, which in turn will ignite the natural gas pilot fuel, supplying any oxygen needed for burning the pilot fuel. The pilot fuel can always be heated to a higher temperature if it is not mixed with air before injecting into propulsion fuel. (In this working cycle, the temperature of the propulsion fuel-air mixture in the combustion chamber at TDC will be lower than its auto-ignition temperature at the time of the hot pilot fuel injection.)</p>
  <p num="p-0416">If the pilot fuel is a flammable hot gas, it originates from a storage tank or supply pipe line, item <b>1</b> and <b>1</b> <i>a</i>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20</figref> or from conduit <b>43</b> of FIG. <b>21</b>. From there, it proceeds as suggested in method B for non-flammable gas. The flammable gas, which is hotter than the propulsion mix, catalyzes the ignition of the propulsion gas which, in turn, catalyzes ignition of the pilot gas which has a higher auto-ignition temperature.</p>
  <heading>Direct Combustion Chamber Ignition</heading> <p num="p-0417">Alternatively, with piston <b>22</b> near TDC, with preparation chamber eliminated, the charge is ignited by spark or alternatively, conduit <b>41</b> is extended directly into and can intrude fully and directly into combustion chamber <b>38</b>. Then at the proper moment, a charge of the pure pilot fuel or air-fuel mix in line <b>41</b> is injected optionally by injector <b>42</b> into the combustion chamber <b>38</b> and mixed with the air-fuel propulsion mix within the chamber <b>38</b>. Ignition is catalyzed by temperature increase by the higher temperature of the higher auto-ignition temperature pilot fuel, catalyzing ignition of the lower auto-ignition temperature propulsion fuel, (pilot fuel could be dimethyl ether or natural gas (CNG) for diesel or gasoline fueled engines), whereupon the propulsion fuel ignites the pilot fuel and this combusting charge expands to drive piston <b>22</b> in the power stroke. The scavenging stroke then occurs, completing a power cycle.</p>

  <p num="p-0419">In the engine of this invention, when diesel fuel is used, the density of the air-fuel charge can reach and even far exceed that which is obtainable in any Diesel Cycle engine, while maintaining a temperature before combustion, lower than the auto-ignition temperature of a diesel oil-air mixture which is produced by about an 8:1 compression ratio, thus making practical spark ignition, modified HCCI or true HCCI.</p>

  <heading>Method D HCCI, Operational Design 17 Pilot Fuels with Low Auto-Ignition Temperature</heading> <p num="p-0428">The primary propulsion charge is taken into cylinder according to any of the Operating Designs 1 through 13. The compression stroke continues or takes place with the supplementary supercharging charge being injected and with the propulsion air-fuel homogenized and the temperature of the fuel-air mix at piston TDC adjusted to near auto-ignition, but the air-fuel propulsion charge is at a higher temperature than that of the auto-ignition temperature of the pilot fuel.</p>
  <p num="p-0429">The propulsion air-fuel charge is now compressed stroke in cylinder <b>7</b> by piston <b>22</b> with preparation chamber <b>38</b>′ and combustion chamber <b>38</b> containing the entire propulsion charge above piston <b>22</b>, at near auto-ignition temperature, at near TDC. The fuel-air charge is ignited by conventional spark plug or by HCCI for HCCI operation. Conduit <b>41</b>, with fuel injector pump <b>42</b>, (in phantom), FIG. <b>19</b> through <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19-B</figref>, receives and contains pilot fuel, perhaps from a common fuel-rail. The pilot-fuel is an air-fuel mixture where the pilot fuel is one that has a lower auto-ignition temperature than that of the auto-ignition temperature of the fuel or air-fuel mix which powers the engine. Diesel fuel or diesel-air mix could be an appropriate pilot fuel for gasoline-air, dimethyl ether-air, natural gas-air or some of the alcohols as propulsion fuel operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0430">The small amount of the engine's propulsion fuel mix in combustion chamber <b>38</b>, is at a temperature less than its own auto-ignition temperature, but higher than the auto-ignition temperature of the pilot fuel, and is now pressed into pre-combustion chamber <b>38</b>′ near piston TDC. Simultaneously, a small amount of pilot fuel or pilot fuel-air mix in line <b>41</b> is injected by fuel injection pump <b>42</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, into pre-combustion chamber <b>38</b>′. (Alternatively, the pilot fuel or pilot air-fuel mix can be injected through conduit <b>36</b> with valve <b>40</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, controlling the injection.) The propulsion fuel-air mixture, now in pre-combustion chamber <b>38</b>′, which is hotter than the auto-ignition temperature of the pilot fuel, which is alternatively sans oxygen or pilot fuel-air mix, catalyzes the ignition of the pilot fuel which then causes oxidation of the engine's propulsion fuel and all expands into combustion chamber <b>38</b> where it raises the temperature of the entire air-fuel propulsion mix, broadly catalyzing the reaction, and causes oxidation of the entire charge by quickly raising the temperature of the air-fuel mix propulsion in combustion chamber <b>38</b>. Piston <b>22</b> is pressed into the power stroke. (In the compact combustion chamber with the fuel air premixed (homogenized) and with the turbulence of the new engine system, the combustion will be far more complete than in a compression ignited (CI) engine).</p>
  <heading>Direct Combustion Chamber Combustion</heading> <p num="p-0431">Again, the charge can be ignited by spark or alternatively, ignition can be catalyzed in the following manner: The pre-combustion chamber is eliminated, fuel pump injector <b>42</b> has an inlet conduit <b>41</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, which is directly connected with combustion chamber <b>38</b> (not shown) and may intrude into chamber <b>38</b>. After completion of the compression stroke and near TDC, with the entire propulsion charge being above piston <b>22</b> in combustion chamber <b>38</b>, a small amount of pilot low-self-ignition-point fuel or air-fuel mix, which itself is at a temperature lower than auto-ignition, is injected by fuel pump <b>42</b> directly into the combustion chamber <b>38</b> of cylinder <b>7</b>. The temperature of the propulsion air-fuel mix in combustion chamber <b>38</b>, being higher than that which will cause the pilot or pilot air-fuel to auto-ignite, raises the temperature of the pilot fuel injected and catalyzes the ignition of the pilot fuel which in turn catalyzes the oxidation of the entire air-fuel charge in combustion chamber <b>38</b>. The power stroke then takes place.</p>
  <heading>Detailed Methods</heading> <p num="p-0432">More detailed operating methods are discussed in method A.</p>
  <heading>True HCCI Method E, Operational Design 18 Universal Spontaneous Combustion</heading> <p num="p-0433">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19-B</figref>, cylinder <b>7</b> is fitted with a combustion chamber <b>38</b> or, in addition, a pre-combustion chamber <b>38</b>′. The fuel-air charge can be ignited by spark or by HCCI. For HCCI, either or both chambers have sensors to detect conditions in the chamber, e.g., temperature sensor <b>21</b>′, density sensor <b>21</b>″, and any other sensors needed to monitor other conditions such as oxygen levels, crank angle etc. These sensors relay messages to ECM-<b>27</b>, FIGS. <b>1</b> through <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18</figref>, <b>18</b>-B and <b>18</b>-C which contains a computer to send messages to activators to operate various controls. These controls then adjust fluid flows and valve happenings and to either increase or decrease electrical energy, charge air density, in regard to the duty cycle of the engine, and to adjust the valving <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, along with heat-of-compression and to control the charge temperature near piston (TDC). The latter will be just above the temperature to cause the air-fuel charge to self ignite at TDC. The controls and methods are described in the descriptions for <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19-B</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19-C</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19-D</figref>, FIG. <b>1</b> and FIG. <b>2</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0434">Optionally, each cylinder can have separate controls if needed. For multi-cylinder engines, as described under <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19-B</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19-C</figref> descriptions, each combustion chamber <b>38</b> or <b>38</b>-B or pre-combustion chamber <b>38</b>′ can have at least two temperature sensors <b>21</b>′ and two pressure or density sensors <b>21</b>″. The computer of ECM-<b>27</b> receives the message from each cylinder, finds the mean value of each, sums up the values individually or collectively, and calculates the mean values. ECM-<b>27</b> then instructs the various heat and valving controls to adjust the density and temperature (in conjunction with the cylinders heat-of-compression) of the engine air-fuel charge in each cylinder near piston TDC to produce a proper density charge and temperature, which would be at auto-ignition temperature at piston TDC for the air-fuel propulsion mixture fueling the engine. The charge should ignite preferably at 10-15 degrees before or at TDC as detected by crank angle sensor. The arrangement, described for <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, provides double the “bum” time at piston TDC for many advantages in any engine.</p>
  <p num="p-0435">In using the pre-combustion chamber <b>38</b>′, the temperature sensors <b>21</b>′ in combustion chamber <b>38</b>, sense the temperature and relay the message to various controls to adjust conditions, including electrical heating or fluids in cooling ducts, to produce a temperature at that of auto-ignition, preferably at 10-15 degrees before or at piston TDC. Sensors <b>21</b>′ in pre-combustion chamber <b>38</b>′ relay a message to ECM-<b>27</b> to adjust the controls of heating elements <b>37</b> and <b>39</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19-B</figref> and/or to adjust cooling fluid flows, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-B</figref>, <b>19</b>-C and <b>19</b>-D to the proper temperature for catalyzing auto-ignition of the air-fuel charge in the pre-combustion chamber at that point. This will start the engine running and maintain smooth operation. The ancillary individual cylinder cooling system of FIG. <b>6</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in which cooling is provided by cool air or by air chilled by expansion valve <b>4</b>′, all controlled by ECM-<b>27</b>, may be employed in temperature control.</p>
  <p num="p-0436">After the engine is in operation, the heat of combustion will likely supply all of the needed heat plus some in excess. In order to reduce the heat level of either the pre-combustion chamber <b>38</b>′ or the combustion chamber <b>38</b>, chill cooling channel <b>36</b>-B and/or <b>41</b>-B with control valves <b>40</b>-B and/or <b>42</b>-B and the appropriate cooling or heat control jackets and conduits arranged surrounding the chambers <b>38</b> and/or <b>38</b>′, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-B</figref>, <b>19</b>-C and <b>19</b>-D can be utilized, perhaps in conjunction with temperature control of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 5</figref>.

  <p num="p-0469">The HCCI operation charge temperatures are adjusted by means described in method <b>1</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19</figref>, <b>19</b>-B, <b>19</b>-C and <b>19</b>-D. At near TDC, for example, at the point projection <b>22</b>′ on piston <b>22</b> enters port <b>22</b>″ of combustion chamber <b>38</b>-B, sensors <b>21</b>′ and <b>22</b>″ with perhaps other sensors sense and signal the temperature and density levels to ECM-<b>27</b> to adjust flow rates by way of valves <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>,<b>6</b> and <b>10</b>′ to produce the conditions of the air-fuel charge desired at that particular point.</p>
  <p num="p-0470">This temperature is slightly lower than auto-ignition temperature. As piston <b>22</b> completes the compression stroke, the outer face of the piston rises to nearly flush with the face of the engine head <b>10</b> and piston projection <b>23</b> has entered port <b>24</b> of head <b>4</b> and is now flush with the lower part of combustion chamber <b>38</b>-B (chamber <b>38</b>-B may be semi-hemispherical or cylindrical in shape as illustrated by <b>38</b>-B and <b>38</b>-C [the latter in phantom] of FIG. <b>19</b>-D).</p>
  <p num="p-0471">As piston crown A approaches face of engine head <b>4</b>, piston projection <b>22</b>′ enters and continues to travel in the restricted space of combustion chamber port <b>22</b>″. (There are no pressure sealing rings on piston projection <b>22</b>′). This means that as piston crown A approaches engine head face <b>4</b>, all of the fuel-air charge above the full piston crown is compressed toward and into port <b>22</b>″ and escapes confinement in the cylinder <b>7</b> by being forced through the small space surrounding projection <b>22</b>′ traveling up into combustion chamber <b>38</b>-B or optionally <b>38</b>-C. As pressures above piston crown A and in chamber <b>38</b>-B attempt to equilibrate, vortical motion occurs in the fluids in the narrow passages between <b>22</b>′ and <b>22</b>″ and throughout chamber <b>38</b>-B, further stirring and mixing the fuel-air charge. This produces equilibration in fuel, air and temperature of mixture and assures absence of cyclic variations as combustion occurs.</p>
  <p num="p-0472">The sudden rise of temperature in the fuel-air charge at this time, caused by the short projection <b>22</b>′ producing instantaneous pressure and heat increase. causes a uniform low temperature universal oxidation of the charge which is true HCCI operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0473">The engine can be alternatively started up by spark plug <b>37</b> firing at TDC which is the last position for firing and obtaining maximum efficiency. In a few moments, the temperature in chamber <b>38</b>-B will become conducive to spontaneous ignition and ECM-<b>27</b> tells spark plug to cease firing.</p>
  <p num="p-0474">Optionally, ECM-<b>27</b> tells the electronic ignition system each time a cylinder should fail to fire, then spark plug <b>37</b> will spark just after auto-ignition should fail to occur. This assures reliable cylinder firing.</p>
  <p num="p-0475">Alternatively, spark plug <b>37</b> may continue firing at TDC. This is a little later than optimum ignition timing. Therefore, at such a time that auto-ignition should fail to occur, then only perhaps 5 degrees crank angle later, spark plug <b>37</b> fires to ignite the charge, assuring fail-safe and smooth engine ignition.</p>
  <heading>Refrigeration Cooling and Powering by Compressed or Liquified Natural Gas or Hydrogen</heading> <p num="p-0476">Briefly noted, there is shown three schematic drawings, (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, FIG. <b>21</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>) representing yet another embodiment of apparatuses useful in the field of air conditioning, power generation and heating, from which yet other methods of operation can be performed and will be described. Six alternative systems are depicted, utilizing highly condensed gas, such as compressed natural gas or hydrogen or liquefied natural gas or liquefied hydrogen for, (1) compression refrigeration before the gas is combusted by being consumed for (2) gas fired absorption chillers, or (3) burned in reciprocating or rotary turbine engines or (4) consumed for furnace for steam turbines or (5) consumed for space heating. For liquefied natural gas, the first task is optionally cryocooling which is then followed by the several succeeding tasks.</p>

Associated with item <b>9</b> are a vent or exhaust pipe <b>12</b>, optional heat exchanger <b>13</b> and vent or exhaust line <b>14</b>. All of these are designed for utilizing compression cooling, absorption cooling and fueling by compressed natural gas (CNG), compressed hydrogen (CH<sub>2</sub>) or as depicted and described for <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</figref> for liquefied natural gas (LNG) or liquefied hydrogen (LH) to perform work before the gas is consumed as fuel in <b>9</b> of FIG. <b>20</b>.</p>

  <heading>Co-Generation Using Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) or Liquefied Hydrogen (LH) for Cryogenic Cooling Compression-Expansion Cooling, Absorption Cooling and Fueling Tasks</heading> <p num="p-0479">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, there is shown a schematic sectional view of a storage tank <b>18</b>, containing liquefied gas, such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) or liquefied hydrogen (LH), with associated liquid outlet withdrawal tube <b>20</b>, flow economizer regulator <b>5</b>, associated conduit fuel shut off valve <b>11</b> and associated conduit leading to excess flow valve <b>9</b> with associated conduit leading to optional cryogenic pump <b>40</b>. Optional pump <b>40</b> has an optional bypass system comprised of bypass valve <b>35</b> and conduit <b>34</b>, to be used at any time cryogenic pump <b>40</b> is not required. A conduit <b>43</b> conveys liquefied gas to optional pressurizer <b>15</b> through which the conduit optionally forms coils and exits to an optional shut-off valve <b>5</b>′ on associated conduit <b>43</b>. Pressurizer <b>15</b> receives the LNG or LH effluent in a conduit <b>43</b> which coils inside the pressurizer casing in order to expose the coil to an optional fluid which is optionally pumped through, and then, after operating pressure builds in pressurizer <b>15</b>, the LNG or LH exits to conduit <b>43</b> outlet. An inlet port <b>41</b> to the pressurizer <b>15</b> can optionally conduct fluid (air or liquid) through and around pressurizer <b>15</b> coils. The warming fluid is then expelled through duct or port <b>42</b>, optionally to the atmosphere. The LNG or LH is slightly warmed in <b>18</b> or <b>15</b>, if necessary, to raise boil-off vapor pressure in tank <b>18</b> or in pressurizer <b>15</b> to expel the liquefied gas through conduit <b>43</b> which is alternatively connected to conduit <b>2</b> in FIG. <b>20</b>. Conduit <b>43</b> is first alternatively connected to inlet of flexible duct <b>4</b> within electric superconductor cable <b>3</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> with the exit port <b>4</b>′ of duct <b>4</b> being now connected to conduit <b>2</b> in FIG. <b>20</b>. (When liquefied gas is used first to super cool electric power cable <b>3</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the liquefied gas tank <b>18</b> or pressurizer <b>15</b> is kept cold and not heated, but pumped from tank <b>18</b> by cryogenic pump <b>40</b> and out conduit <b>43</b> and first through conduit <b>2</b>, FIG. <b>20</b> and to succeeding apparatuses.) This provides two preferred means of supplying LNG or LH at a volume and pressure needed to alternatively push the liquefied natural gas or hydrogen through (a) cryocooling tube <b>4</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> for sub-cooling electric superconductor power cable <b>3</b>, as depicted in FIG. <b>23</b> and then into a pressurizer, as <b>15</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, to build pressure required for (b) compression-expansion refrigeration shown in FIG. <b>20</b>. These two refrigeration systems can be accomplished with no chemical change in the gases. Another use of the same gas can be for a third refrigeration system which is labeled here as (c) absorption-refrigeration, a system which consumes the gas as fuel. Therefore, the gas can be used for two tasks before being consumed in a third task, thus providing a co-generation system in which one volume of gas performs three services. Other optional tasks for this chemically unchanged fuel are (d) firing a gas turbine for producing power, (e) firing steam turbine for electric power production, (f) engine (ICE or turbine) charge air chilling, (g) firing a reciprocating ICE for electric power production and (h) firing space heating furnace and other apparatuses, depicted in FIG. <b>20</b>. These latter described operations are accomplished and fueled by CNG or LNG, or CH<sup>2 </sup>or LH and associated apparatuses. System (c) to (g) consume LNG or LH as operating fuels after the LNG or LH has already performed tasks (a) and/or (b), indicated above. As indicated above, the same units of liquefied gas can supercool electric superconductor cable <b>3</b>, air-condition the power plant (after exiting the cable duct), spin an impulse turbine and fuel a gas turbine or ICE which produces the electric power, or alternatively provided absorption chilling, steam turbine, heating furnace, etc.</p>
  <heading>Operation of LNG or LH Fuel Tank</heading> <p num="p-0480">Boil-off vapor pressure in fuel tank <b>18</b>, with back pressure up o 280 psi, presses the liquefied gas out liquid withdrawal tube <b>20</b> through valves <b>11</b> and <b>9</b>, through valve <b>35</b>, bypass conduit <b>34</b>, through optional pressurizer <b>15</b> and out conduit <b>43</b>, which in use is alternatively connected to inlet port <b>4</b> of cryogenic cooler tube <b>4</b> of electric superconductor cable <b>3</b>, shown in FIG. <b>23</b> and which outlet <b>4</b>′ of tube <b>4</b> is alternatively connected to conduit <b>2</b> in FIG. <b>20</b>. Alternatively, outlet <b>43</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is connected directly to conduit <b>2</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> when cryogenic cooling is not needed. If the boil-off pressure in tank <b>18</b> is too low, bypass valve <b>35</b> optionally directs the LNG or LH<sub>2 </sub>from tank <b>18</b> to cryogenic pump <b>40</b> which pumps the effluent through conduit <b>43</b>. If needed and cryogenic cooling is not required, atmospheric air or other fluid is pumped into inlet duct <b>41</b> of pressurizer <b>15</b> and circulates around conduit <b>43</b> and the exists through port <b>42</b> after imparting slight heat to the liquefied gas, causing pressurizer <b>15</b> to build desired pressure. Alternatively, boil-off vapor pressure is allowed to build in tank <b>18</b> by inducing slight heat in tank and/or by restraining the boil-off pressure until desired operating pressure is attained to express the liquefied gas from conduit <b>4</b>. At the point the boil-off pressure is to drive the vanes of the turbine, the liquefied gas is completely vaporized, optionally in a system such as vaporizer <b>15</b> of FIG. <b>23</b>. When an impulse turbine is to be driven by compressed or vaporized liquid gas, it is a driver solely or in a co-generation system and is fitted into the scheme at the place in the system that the compressed gas or the liquefied gas vapor is best suited as an impeller. Then the gas is collected for further use.</p>
  <p num="p-0481">The LNG or LH in tank can be kept at the desired temperature and the liquefied gas is pressed out conduit <b>43</b> outlet, and, in the case of the first use suggested, into inlet <b>4</b> of superconductor conduit and through conduit <b>4</b> of FIG. <b>23</b>. Then after cooling superconductor cable <b>3</b>, it exits an outlet duct or valve <b>4</b>′, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> into a system to re-liquefy or store what now may be partial gas effluent, or alternatively into conduit <b>2</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> by way of conduit (in phantom) depicted as being from <b>43</b> of FIG. <b>21</b>. Hereafter, it can operate any or all of the apparatuses depicted and described for FIG. <b>20</b> and alternatively driving a turbine. Alternatively, the LNG or LH from conduit <b>43</b> may go directly from conduit <b>43</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> to conduit <b>2</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, or to any or all of the apparatuses depicted and described for FIG. <b>20</b>. For example, it can go directly to fuel the turbine or ICE <b>9</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> which is preferable to the engine producing the electric power going through electric superconductor cable <b>3</b>. Alternatively, expansion valve <b>10</b>′ of chilled system of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> creates back-pressure needed in pressurizer <b>15</b> or LNG or LH<sub>2 </sub>tank <b>18</b>, to build operating pressure (ideally 200-280 psi) for expansion chilling of item <b>5</b> (in this case, a refrigerator) of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, or to drive a turbine, also represented by item <b>5</b>, whether conduit <b>43</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, leads first to conduit <b>2</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, or to conduit <b>4</b> of FIG. <b>23</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0482">The boil-off pressure in tank <b>18</b> can be sufficient to present the amount of liquefied gas needed to supply the equipment depicted in FIG. <b>23</b> and FIG. <b>20</b>. Alternatively, valve <b>35</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is closed to bypass conduit <b>34</b> and the liquefied gas is pumped by cryogenic pump <b>40</b> through the pressurizer <b>15</b>, where the liquefied gas builds pressure, if needed, to the desired level within pressurizer <b>15</b> and then, at the pressure desired, expels the LNG or LH out conduit exit port <b>43</b> into conduit <b>2</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> or alternatively, (without the temperature being changed and preferably at minus 260° F. or lower) through inlet <b>4</b> of conduit <b>4</b>′ of FIG. <b>23</b> and from outlet of conduit <b>4</b>′ FIG. <b>23</b>. From there, the liquefied gas can be optionally ducted to conduit <b>2</b> of FIG. <b>20</b> and/or to any of the other apparatuses described. Cryogenic pump <b>40</b> prevents any unwanted pressure escaping the pressurizer <b>15</b> back into LNG or LH tank <b>18</b>, if the pressure in <b>15</b> is greater than that desired in tank <b>18</b>. Ideally, boil-off vapor pressure in storage tank <b>18</b> will present the LNG or LH to conduit <b>43</b> bypassing cryogenic pump <b>40</b>, by bypass system <b>35</b> and <b>34</b> when the level of pressure in tank <b>18</b> is that desired. The temperature in tank <b>18</b> is determined by the pressure of the LNG or LH stored in the tank and which pressure can be adjusted as also in pressurizer <b>15</b> (As stated earlier, the pressure desired in tank <b>18</b> can be produced by exerting back pressure on the tank <b>18</b> until working pressure is attained or by slight heating of contents).</p>
  <p num="p-0483">If necessary, the pressure is produced in pressurizer <b>15</b> by passing fluid in inlet port <b>41</b>, through casing of pressurizer <b>15</b> and out port <b>42</b>. The temperature adjusting fluid in casing of <b>15</b> can be a fluid such as liquid or other type of coolant or preferably return or ambient temperature-air from cooled or heated space such as a building, or even ambient temperature atmospheric air. In either case, the chilled fluid exiting port <b>42</b> can be directed to supplement other means of chilling or provide primary chilling for a truck-cab or bus, etc. Not much heat is required to raise the pressure of LNG or LH in tank <b>18</b> or <b>15</b>. The former generally is stored at 260° below zero F. temperature. LH is stored at minus 460 degrees Fahrenheit For expansion chilling with LNG or LH, the temperature in <b>18</b> or <b>15</b> could be as low as minus 168° F., or lower, and for compressed gas, perhaps a pressure of 260 psi or even lower. (A passenger bus powered by CNG, LNG, CH or LH can very economically provide air conditioning for the passengers and then use the chemically unaltered gas to power the bus engine.) This system can also be utilized for refrigerated trucks, etc.)</p>
  <p num="p-0484">Using a conventional air-conditioning system, a fifty passenger bus would require about 50 horse power of energy to air-condition the vehicle. This amount of fuel can be conserved by utilizing a co-generation system in which expanding gas produces work as described herein.</p>
  <heading>Operation Method</heading> <p num="p-0485">Compressed gases, such as natural gas and hydrogen are obtained from a storage tank such as tank <b>1</b> <i>a </i>or from pipeline <b>1</b>, of FIG. <b>20</b>. Liquefied gases are provided by tanks as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, item <b>18</b>. In the case of compressed gas, it can be stored at pressures of 3,600 psi, and can be obtained by pipeline at nearly the same pressures. Liquefied gases can super-cool and afterward develop working pressure and perform work and the same gas can then be consumed as fuel. Described here are methods of utilizing the super-cooling ability of liquefied gas and the pressure drop of liquefied or compressed gas, in either case, to perform work before the gas is consumed as fuel.</p>

The gas can be used as in FIG. <b>20</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> for one or more chilling systems or to drive an impulse turbine and then, as shown in conduits <b>16</b> and <b>29</b>, the gas can then be directed to one or more other tasks, or conduit <b>16</b> can have any number of division into conduits to supply any or all of the systems (1) through (5) suggested herein.</p>

After cryocooling electric cable, the partly liquefied and/or gaseous fuel chills incoming charge air by chillers, drives an impulse turbine and fuels gas turbine. Alternatively, after the gaseous fuel has emerged from the task of expansion-chilling intake air for a turbine engine <b>9</b>, it is collectively directed by duct <b>7</b> through <b>8</b>, which is a heat exchanger for heating the gas, as for fueling a turbine. Alternatively <b>8</b> is a compressor for optionally recompressing the gas charge for fueling turbine, <b>9</b>. The cold charge air is then mixed with the turbine fuel and combusted for a more dense charge. Chilling the air charge for a turbine produces greater steady-state power and hence will also change the factors for calculating the de-rate value when operating the turbine in a hot climate or high altitude.</p>
  <p num="p-0494">System (D). The high pressure partly liquefied and/or gaseous fuel, after cooling superconductor electric cable <b>3</b>, provides both compression chilling such as for air conditioning and/or as an impulse turbine in <b>5</b>, FIG. <b>20</b> and also fuels boiler furnace for a steam turbine <b>9</b>.</p>

The high pressure partly liquefied and/or gaseous fuel, after cooling superconductor electric cable <b>3</b>, provides compression chilling, such as for air conditioning and to drive an impulse turbine in <b>5</b>, FIG. <b>20</b> and also fuels space heating furnace <b>9</b> or, alternatively fuels absorption chiller, also represented by <b>9</b>.</p>
  <heading>Compressed or Liquefied Natural Gas or Hydrogen for Refrigeration Systems, Continued Discussion</heading> <p num="p-0496">The percentage of natural gas or hydrogen mixed in the air charge for fueling an engine is as high as 15% of the total charge. If the first task in a co-generation is refrigeration or air conditioning, the pressure of the liquefied or compressed gaseous fuel, (natural gas, hydrogen, etc.) is adjusted to the ideal pressure, perhaps 280 psi, more or less, for most efficient expansion cooling and to be then used mixed with the air for fuel requirements.</p>
  <p num="p-0497">Triple or quadruple co-generation of LNG or LH can provide (a) cryo-cooling superconductor electric cables, (b) compression expansion chilling and/or (c) driving an impulse turbine and (d) absorption chilling. Alternatively, it then provides for fueling of the associated power generator turbines for which the liquefied gas is serving as electric cable cryo-cooler or fueling any of the systems suggested for item <b>9</b> of FIG. <b>20</b>.</p>
  <heading>Dual or Triple Use (Co-Generation) of Liquid Super-Coolant for Superconductor Cable</heading> <p num="p-0498">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, there is shown an electric superconductor cable used for transferring electric current without resistance in the conductor. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> shows skid wires C for protecting the cable. C-<b>1</b> is electrical insulation; <b>2</b> is two layers of thermal insulation; <b>3</b> is superconductor tape (electric wire); <b>4</b> is the entrance port to flexible duct <b>4</b>′ for liquid coolant; <b>5</b> is liquefied natural gas (LNG) or liquefied hydrogen (LH) or, alternatively liquefied nitrogen (LN). In a co-generation system, liquefied nitrogen is capable of performing the first two tasks, that of cooling superconducting cable and compression expansion refrigeration as described herein for co-generation systems using liquefied natural gas or liquefied hydrogen. After task two, the nitrogen can be expelled into the atmosphere or can be re-liquefied.</p>
  <heading>Co-Generation</heading> <p num="p-0499">Either LNG or LH is a very efficient coolant for superconductor electric cables. LNG has a temperature of minus 296° F. while the temperature of liquid hydrogen is minus 423° F. Either can be used as (a) an efficient electric superconductor coolant and at the power plant (or taken off at sub-stations and piped to point of use), the exiting LNG or LH<sub>2 </sub>can be utilized for (b) expansion cooling. (Liquefied nitrogen can perform tasks a and b only.) The same flammable gas, chemically unaltered, can be used for (c) driving an impulse turbine and thereafter for any of the following: (1) fueling gas fired absorption cooling, for (2) fueling gas fired engines (ICE generator), for (3) fueling gas fired turbine generator, for (4) fueling gas fired steam turbine generator and/or for (5) fueling gas fired heating boilers, etc. These uses are depicted and described for FIG. <b>20</b> through FIG. <b>23</b>. The triple or quadruple service use of the LNG or LH is in cooling superconductor cable <b>3</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, then channeling the liquefied gas to an expansion chiller <b>5</b> in FIG. <b>20</b> and then for spinning a fueling or for gas fired absorption chiller <b>9</b>, also in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> or alternatively, for fueling (having consumed for) one or more tasks (a), (e), (f) and (g) above. Therefore, the same LNG or LH provides cryocooling and two other types of chilling <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> on the same volume of gas. In addition, the same coolant gas can first turn a turbine and then any or all of the following: fuel engines, turbines and boilers as described above and in FIG. <b>20</b> and FIG. <b>21</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0500">To reiterate briefly, the coolant LNG, or LH can be put into flexible duct <b>4</b> of superconductor cable <b>3</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> at the sub-stations and taken off at the power plant or taken off at other substations and piped collectively to the power plant and used there to chill (expansion) cool and drive the impulse turbine and then fuel the generators or gas turbines or ICE generators and/or be used as fuel for further chilling absorption. After using to super cool electric cable <b>3</b>, the coolant liquefied gas can be ducted off at the power station or at a sub-station and transported to the plant in a conduit formed under another layer of insulation <b>2</b> and can be used or stored at any convenient place for use in cooling, firing turbines, etc., or can be stored, re-liquefied or sold. Alternative liquefied gas, after use as sub-coolant, can be taken off flexible duct <b>4</b>′ and ducted collectively in a separate conduit to the power plant or to whatever point the gas can be used or stored.</p>

  <p num="p-0503">A British publication<sup>1 </sup>in an article entitled <i>The Big Chill </i>discusses the need for and the progress of transmitting electric power long distance by way of superconductor cables, which improves the efficiency of electrical transmission by at least ten percent. Among other statements, they say “Superconducting cables can carry at least three times the power of the copper it replaces” and “We are at the point where it is worth running superconductors, and everyone is beginning to realize it”.</p>
  <p num="p-0504"> <sup>1</sup>New Scientist, 13 Oct. 2001, vol. 172 #2312 </p>
  <p num="p-0505">They further discuss the very significant progress made in researching the technology and have performed a large test project in Frisbie, a neighborhood in Detroit, Mich. In this system, the superconductor cables must be kept very cold. In the wrap-up of the article they state: “The remaining problem is that the refrigeration technology needed to keep the superconductor cable supplied with liquid nitrogen is not ready for commercial use. The cryogenic shed at Frisbie is reliable, but it was put together specifically for this project. It has lots of back-up systems to ensure that the project doesn't fail simply for lack of coolant, which means that it wouldn't be economical for general use.”</p>
  <p num="p-0506">The invention described for <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, FIG. <b>21</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> provides a very reliable answer to the problem of the cooling of superconductor cables with the added benefit of providing a system of co-generation, whereby liquefied flammable gases (and also compressed gases) can be used for many other purposes after being used for cooling the superconductor electric cables or compression chilling, etc. Also, compressed gases form a co-generation system as described for <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 through 23</figref>.</p>
  <heading>Cold Air Supercharged Epitrochoid Rotary Engine Operating in Any of Operational Designs 1, 2, 3 or 4</heading> <p num="p-0507">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, there is shown a perspective view (with portions in cross-section and schematically) an improved epitrochoid (Wankel) type rotary internal combustion engine which is cold air supercharged and operating optionally in any of the four Operational Designs as described for engines of FIG. <b>2</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0508">These Designs briefly described are:</p>
  <p num="p-0509">Operational Design 1: In this Design, intake port <b>3</b>N (dotted line) <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> with normal port size, the quantity of a primary air charge drawn into compression chamber <b>5</b>-C through port <b>3</b>N by rotor <b>2</b>, is as in the normal Wankel rotary engine with the engine receiving as large amount of air or fuel-air charge as possible, which with the combustion chamber being of normal size, produces normal compression and expansion ratios. Compression of the charge begins as the following rotor lobe covers port <b>3</b>N. During the compression process, a dense, cooled or chilled supplementary supercharging charge of air or fuel-air (received, compressed and cooled externally) is injected by valve <b>9</b> through port <b>4</b>′ or port <b>9</b>′, which optionally is fitted with an expansion valve <b>4</b>, into the compression chamber <b>5</b>-C, preferably late in the compression process. This provides cooling along with increased charge density and turbulence. Compression continues as rotor <b>2</b> continues motion until combustion chamber <b>5</b>-A is at or near TDC, FIG. <b>24</b>B. There, the charge is ignited, expanding into expansion chamber <b>5</b>-E, producing rotor movement for the power, scavenging, air intake and compressing functions of rotor <b>2</b> lobes for great power, torque and efficiency with low polluting emissions. With exhaust port <b>6</b> placed in the wall of stator <b>1</b> end plate <b>18</b>′ and away from the periphery of the end plate as the expansion chamber is scavenged through port <b>6</b>, centrifugal force spins the heavier fuel fumes away from and past the exhaust port <b>6</b> to be returned to combustion chamber <b>5</b>A with the new air charge for further combustion. In this Design, compression and expansion ratios are equal.</p>
  <p num="p-0510">Operational Design 2: In Design 2, the primary air or fuel-air drawn in the port <b>3</b>N is again as normal for the epitrochoid rotary engine, to capture again a full charge, but the combustion chamber <b>5</b>-A of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and</figref>. <b>24</b>-B is significantly larger in volume than that of current engines, thus producing a low substandard compression ratio for low heat-of-compression for the initial portion of charge. Also, in this Design, compression and expansion ratios are equal.</p>
  <p num="p-0511">During the compression process of the primary air drawn through inlet port <b>3</b>-N, a dense cooled or chilled air or fuel-air charge, which was received, compressed and cooled or chilled outside of the engine, is injected by valve <b>9</b>, through port <b>4</b>′ or port <b>9</b>′, which can be an expansion valve <b>9</b>′. Since the initial (primary) charge is a very low compression ratio, it produces small heat-of-compression. The cooled supercharging air or fuel/air charge, depending on the point it is injected into the compression stroke, also has a low “effective” compression ratio and combined with the cool initial charge, produces very small heat-of-compression for very low peak temperatures and pressures. Compression continues and at combustion chamber <b>5</b>-A, near or at TDC, the charge is ignited causing the power, scavenging, compression and intake action of rotor <b>2</b>, thus providing great power, torque and efficiency with ultra low polluting emissions, completing a power cycle.</p>
  <p num="p-0512">Operational Design 3: In Design 3, the air intake port <b>3</b>N has been elongated and is now port <b>3</b>E (solid line) of FIG. <b>24</b>. The port <b>3</b>-E is significantly elongated so that when the rotor <b>2</b> passes the port, it begins to draw the air or fuel-air charge into the compression chamber <b>5</b>-C at a later point in its travel, thus pulling in significantly less charge than that received by normal epitrochoid rotary engines. Hence, it produces a low, subnormal effective compression ratio, which in this Design results in an extended expansion ratio.</p>
  <p num="p-0513">Now, the rotation of rotor <b>2</b> pulls in a light air or fuel-air charge and during the compression process, which begins when intake port <b>3</b>E of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is closed by a trailing lobe of rotor <b>2</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, an externally pre-compressed, cooled air or fuel/air charge is injected by valve <b>9</b>, through inlet port <b>4</b>′ or port <b>4</b>, which is optionally an expansion valve <b>9</b>′ Compression continues and when the combustion chamber <b>5</b>-A is at TDC, the charge is ignited, causing rotor <b>2</b> to rotate producing great power and torque to the drive shaft, producing higher efficiency with ultra low polluting emissions. This Design is also selectively supercharged to any desired level even though the effective compression ratio is very low.</p>
  <p num="p-0514">The inlet port <b>3</b>N of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is optionally constructed in such a manner that it is selectively variable in length. The port is alternatively made as long or even longer than that of <b>3</b>E as illustrated in FIG. <b>24</b>. And <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24-B</figref>. Alternatively, a sliding panel (dotted line <b>3</b>N, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>) is so positioned behind port <b>3</b>E that it can be moved by a servo system, controlled by ECM-<b>27</b>. Thus the length can be manipulated selectively from a normal inlet port length, as <b>3</b>N of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, to any length of <b>3</b>E desired. This allows the “effective” compression ratio of the engine to be equal to the expansion ratio or it can be reduced to any desired compression ratio. The compression ratio can be varied infinitely and inversely to the expansion ratio. Port <b>3</b>E of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is an illustration of the means of reducing the volume of primary air charge since the charge intake suction is delayed for low effective compression ratio for very low heat-of-compression and an extended expansion ratio. Also, the compression ratio is alternatively varied by fitting a variable control orifice control valve in outlet port <b>28</b> with proper activator, controlled preferably by ECN-<b>27</b> of FIG. <b>2</b>. By using normal intake port <b>3</b>N and by opening outlet valve <b>28</b> and varying the percentage of fresh charge pumped in by rotor <b>2</b> which is expelled through port <b>28</b>, the compression ratio can be varied from normal (compression ratio equal to the expansion ratio) to an effective compression for that portion of charge as low as 2:1 or 3:1. Then the very dense supercharging air, having a similar effective compression ratio, produces very low heat-of-compression with an expansion ratio which is extended inversely to the effective compression ratio.</p>
  <p num="p-0515">Because of the cool or chilled air charge, the compression ratio can be varied from as much as 40:1 or higher to an effective compression ratio of 3:1 or 2:1 with the expansion ratio being inversely extended.</p>
  <p num="p-0516">Operational Design 4: Design 4 describes another means of charging the engine and combustion chamber <b>5</b>-A. Whereby inlet port <b>3</b> can be normal (<b>3</b>N) or elongated (<b>3</b>E), but using port <b>3</b>N, the initial intake charge is pulled in and then during the majority of the compression process, is pumped out through an ancillary outlet valve <b>28</b>. If mixed with fuel, the charge, which is expelled, is conducted from conduit <b>28</b> to the suction side of either compressor <b>14</b> or compressor <b>16</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, preventing the pollution of the air or the wasting of fuel. Optionally, a bypass valve R<sub>1 </sub>and conduit X<sub>1 </sub>are used to partly bypass compressor <b>16</b> and a similar bypass system, R<sub>2 </sub>and X<sub>2</sub>, together allow control of charge pressures and temperatures, preferably controlled by ECM-<b>27</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, making spark, compression ignition or HCCI operation feasible for all fuels, including diesel.</p>
  <p num="p-0517">In any Operational Design, the dense, cooled or chilled supercharged air is alternatively injected directly into the combustion chamber as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24-B</figref> and <b>25</b>-B where conduit <b>11</b> and injector valve <b>9</b>″ inject the air or fuel-air directly into combustion chamber <b>5</b>-A. In this case, combustion chamber <b>5</b>-A already contains the residual low effective compression effective ratio air or fuel-air charge, thus producing a doubly cool initial combustion process.</p>
  <p num="p-0518">As most of the initial charge is expelled and ancillary port <b>28</b> is closed, preferably by rotor <b>2</b>, inlet valve <b>9</b> (optionally, an expansion valve <b>9</b>′) opens and injects the pre-compressed cooled or chilled air or fuel/air charge into the compression process above the combustion chamber as it swings into TDC position to be sealed and ignited. Now, the charge is ignited by spark or HCCI, thereby depressing the rotor into the power, scavenging, intake and compression processes to complete a power cycle.</p>
  <p num="p-0519">In this system, the pumping through an initial air or fuel-air charge is helpful in cooling the combustion chamber <b>5</b>-A, making the task of controlling charge temperatures simpler, especially in HCCI engine operations.</p>
  <p num="p-0520">The supplemental charge injection in this system is cold and has an “effective compression ratio of perhaps 2:1 to zero and being the entire working charge, is very adequate in density to provide superior power and torque with ultra low emissions.</p>
  <p num="p-0521">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24-B</figref>, there is shown a schematic illustration of the engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, to show the combustion chamber <b>5</b>-A in firing position and the optional methods of inducing air charges through ports <b>3</b>E (charge B) and <b>4</b> (charge A) respectively for any Operational Design, the latter injected from conduit <b>11</b>, combined and now in the combustion chamber <b>5</b>-A. And also depicting the heavy unburned hydrocarbons <b>18</b> being moved to the outer side of the exhaust port <b>6</b> by centrifugal force and how they are sent along with the fresh charge to pass again through combustion chamber and ignition. In addition, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24-B</figref> shows an alternative scheme for injecting the supercharging air through conduit <b>11</b> into the primary charge in the combustion chamber <b>5</b>-A. In this system, the secondary charge is injected directly by conduit <b>11</b> and valve <b>9</b>″ into combustion chamber <b>5</b>-A of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24-B</figref> as combustion chamber <b>5</b>-A rotates into TDC position.</p>
  <p num="p-0522">Bypass system valve R<sub>1 </sub>and conduit X<sub>1 </sub>are optionally used to bypass wholly or partially compressor <b>16</b> or to through-put the entire charge. A similar bypass system, valve R<sub>2 </sub>and X<sub>2 </sub>offer optional through-put of charge or to wholly or partially bypass charge going through intercooler <b>17</b>. Thus, charge pressure, temperature and density may be closely controlled by a control unit such as ECM-<b>27</b> of FIG. <b>2</b>. With ECM-<b>27</b> monitoring temperatures and pressures in combustion chambers and adjusting all activator systems to the optimum for the ignition system used, allows spark ignition, compression ignition or HCCI operation for all fuels including diesel oils.</p>
  <p num="p-0523">As described earlier and depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24-B</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25-B</figref>, the supplementary charge is alternatively injected directly into combustion chamber <b>5</b>-A by diverting or channeling conduit <b>11</b>, carrying the cool dense supplementary charge to go directly to the chamber <b>5</b>-A, being injected by valve <b>9</b>″, which is alternatively is an expansion valve after the order described for <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-B</figref> or <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0524">As described heretofore, in this system, the homogenized diesel fuel/air mixture temperature is kept below auto-ignition temperatures until combustion chamber TDC position and is then ignited by spark or HCCI.</p>
  <p num="p-0525">By keeping the charge temperature below the temperature<sup>2 </sup>which will cause auto-ignition of diesel-air mixture (normally about 8:1 compression ratio), the increased density of the charge permits spark ignition with much increased power.</p>
  <p num="p-0526"> <sup>2 </sup>The auto-ignition temperature of diesel fuel/air mixtures in current engines is that produced at about 8:1 compression ratio. The engines of the present invention, rotary or reciprocating design keeps the mixture temperature below that point until the point that ignition is desired. </p>
  <p num="p-0527">In any of the Designs of the epitrochoid rotary (Wankel) type of FIGS. <b>24</b>-<b>25</b>-B or the straight rotary engines of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26-32</figref>, the supplementary and selectively supercharging air or fuel/air charge is optionally injected through inlet valve <b>9</b> which alternatively is an expansion valve <b>9</b>′ injecting compression “chilled” charge whose system provides an even cooler working cycle. Expansion valve <b>9</b>′ is discussed as expansion valve <b>10</b> in great detail, both means and methods in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-B</figref>, <b>2</b>-C, <b>2</b>-D, <b>6</b>-<b>10</b>, <b>11</b>-B, <b>18</b>-B, <b>19</b>-C and <b>19</b>-D.

  <p num="p-0530">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, there is shown a perspective view (with portions in cross-section and schematically), a epitrochoid (Wankel) type rotary internal combustion engine operating in a variant system, different from the Wankel engine and the engine of FIG. <b>24</b>. Optionally, the air or fuel-air charge is doubly compressed and cooled and with a much smaller than normal compression chamber <b>5</b>-A, produces a significantly denser charge.</p>
  <heading>Operation</heading> <p num="p-0531">Epitrochoid engine <b>1</b> receives into compression chamber a normal or pressure boosted air or fuel-air charge through the normal size inlet port <b>3</b>N. As soon as the charge is pulled in by rotor <b>2</b>, port <b>3</b>N is closed by rotation of trailing lobe of the rotor <b>2</b> and compression of charge begins.</p>
  <p num="p-0532">Ancillary valve <b>13</b> is opened by pressure differential and allows the charge being compressed to exit and pass through conduit <b>7</b>, intercooler <b>8</b>, compressor <b>9</b>, intercooler <b>19</b> (items <b>9</b> and <b>19</b> optional) and conduit <b>11</b> to return to inlet valve <b>14</b> and port <b>4</b> or to conduit <b>11</b>″ and valve <b>9</b>″ of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25-B</figref>. Inlet valve <b>14</b> remains closed until proper engine operating pressure has built in cooling compressing system <b>13</b> to <b>14</b>. Compression continues on the small charge remaining in combustion chamber <b>5</b> after outlet port <b>13</b> is passed by rotor <b>2</b> and optionally with valve in port <b>13</b> closed. As soon as operating pressure has built in compressed cooling system <b>13</b>-<b>4</b>, inlet valve <b>14</b> (which is optionally an expansion valve <b>10</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-B</figref>) injects the doubly compressed and cooled air or fuel-air charge into the compression chamber <b>5</b>-C, adding this denser portion late to that charge remaining in the compression chamber <b>5</b>-C, as soon as valve <b>13</b> is closed or passed by rotor <b>2</b>, or at any time later, optionally even during combustion. (The latter case requires the charge to be injected into combustion chamber <b>5</b>-A. Any of the ports of <b>4</b> <i>a</i>-<b>14</b> are optionally constructed through wall of stator <b>1</b> or through end plate <b>18</b> of stator <b>1</b>).</p>
  <p num="p-0533">Alternatively, compressor <b>9</b> and intercooler <b>19</b> may be eliminated and the primary simply cooled and reinjected into compression chamber <b>5</b>-C or into combustion chamber <b>5</b>-A through valve <b>9</b>″ of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25-B</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0534">At the usual point that the current epitrochoid rotary engine is ignited (TDC), the charge is ignited by spark or HCCI. Because of the charge density and temperature control possible, the engine of this invention can be fueled by diesel-air mix and is ignited alternatively by spark or HCCI. HCCI is feasible due to the possibility of keeping the density up and the charge temperature under control by ECM-<b>27</b> (see HCCI systems in FIGS. <b>19</b>-<b>19</b>-D). For a denser charge, the inlet air is pressure boosted. Intercooler <b>19</b> is utilized or optionally partly bypassed through bypass system valve R and conduit X by which the charge temperature is adjusted and controlled preferably by ECM-<b>27</b>, FIG. <b>2</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0535">At ignition, the extremely dense and temperature adjusted charge expands into expansion chamber <b>5</b>-E turning the rotor and producing more power, torque and efficiency while reducing polluting emissions. Again, exhaust port <b>6</b>, being placed in the end-plate of the stator and at a proper distance from the periphery of the end-plate, allows any unburned liquid fuel to be centrifuged along the outer edge of end-plate <b>19</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25-B</figref> and past exhaust port <b>6</b> to pass along with the fresh charge through combustion again to further reduce HC emissions.</p>
  <p num="p-0536">In the engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the effective compression ratio is greatly reduced, producing an extended expansion ratio, but with normal to heavier charge-weight.</p>
  <p num="p-0537">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25-B</figref>, there is shown a perspective of the engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, showing alternate inlet ports for the doubly compressed and cooled charge air or fuel-air mix. The air inlet port <b>3</b>N is as in a normal epitrochoid rotary engine. Outlet port <b>13</b> to conduit <b>7</b> is placed near the end of rotor travel in compression chamber <b>5</b>-C.

  <p num="p-0542">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, there is shown a cross-section of the expansion rotor assembly of the rotary internal combustion engine of FIG. <b>26</b>. The principal components are intake valve <b>14</b>-B receiving air or fuel/air charge from port <b>14</b>-A in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, spark plug <b>12</b>, optional spark plug <b>12</b>A, rotor combustion chamber <b>5</b>′, alternative combustion chamber <b>5</b>-B, rotor <b>2</b>-B, vanes <b>4</b>, alternative vanes <b>4</b>-B, vane seals <b>10</b>, vane guide rollers <b>3</b>, vane loading springs <b>23</b>, exhaust port <b>17</b> and exhaust conduit <b>18</b> (goes to conduit <b>18</b> of FIG. <b>27</b>).</p>
  <heading>Method of Operation</heading> <p num="p-0543">Compressor section of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> receives charge air or fuel-air charge from two sources 1) Port <b>3</b>-B and conduit <b>11</b> receives primary air or fuel/air mix at atmospheric or boosted pressure. 2) A secondary supercharging charge portion of air is inducted through a compressor in this figure, a turbo-charger <b>15</b>, which receives atmospheric air through port <b>16</b> which is optionally mixed with fuel which is optionally carbureted by <b>15</b>-C. The supercharging air or fuel-air charge taken in and compressed by compressor <b>15</b> now passes through a conduit to intercooler <b>17</b>. Then after cooling, it is received and highly compressed by compressor <b>18</b> and then conveyed to intercooler <b>19</b> to conduit <b>20</b> and to high pressure valve <b>21</b> and to intake port <b>22</b>, to be injected by intake valve <b>21</b> into the primary air charge while it is being compressed. Intake valve <b>21</b> is alternatively an expansion valve such as valve <b>10</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-B</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0544">Now, the primary air intake port <b>3</b>-B is fitted with an adjustable volume air return which is used to adjust the compression ratio of the engine from normal (equal to the compression ratio) to a compression ratio which is less than the expansion ratio. The purpose of this system is to selectively and alternatively adjust valve <b>14</b> to allow conduit <b>13</b> to return some part of the air or fuel-air charge back into suction port <b>3</b>-B as rotary rotor vanes <b>4</b> pull in atmospheric pressure or pressure boosted air. This, when used, further reduces the “effective” compression ratio for the primary charge.</p>
  <p num="p-0545">As vanes <b>4</b> rotate, compression of the primary charge begins at inlet conduit <b>11</b> of port <b>3</b>-B, if valve <b>14</b> is closed. If valve <b>14</b> is open at all, the “effective” compression ratio of this initial portion of charge is low which creates small heat-of-compression for this primary charge. (The number of vanes <b>4</b> in compression rotor <b>2</b>-A would be of any magnitude above one and would probably be three or four in number).</p>
  <p num="p-0546">Rotor <b>2</b>-A continues the compression process toward high pressure intake valve <b>21</b>, which is alternatively an expansion valve on the order of valve <b>10</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-B</figref> engine. As a vane <b>4</b> approaches port <b>22</b> and at the appropriate moment before vane <b>4</b> passes port <b>22</b>, intake valve <b>21</b> injects the very dense, cooled or optionally “chilled” air or fuel-air “supercharge” into the compression chamber <b>5</b>-C, bounded on the back-side by a vane <b>4</b> and which charge is rotatably compressed and expelled out port <b>14</b>-A, which is optionally closed by valve <b>14</b>-B between port <b>14</b>-A of FIG. <b>27</b> and combustion chamber <b>5</b>-A of FIG. <b>28</b>. The charge then goes through port <b>14</b>-C, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, which optionally constitutes a sliding valve between stator combustion recess <b>5</b>-A and rotor combustion chamber <b>5</b>′. In this case, combustion chamber <b>5</b>-A is charged and ignited as it rotates past port <b>14</b>-C.</p>
  <p num="p-0547">Combustion System A: Now, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, optional outlet valve <b>14</b>-B opens and closes at such a time that vane <b>4</b> seals the front side of combustion chamber <b>5</b>′ and the back side of the combustion chamber <b>5</b>′ is sealed by close proximity between stator <b>9</b> and rotor <b>2</b>-B. This is described in detail for FIG. <b>30</b>. The fuel-air charge is ignited by spark plug <b>12</b> for the power pulse while combustion chamber <b>5</b>′ is open to plug <b>12</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0548">Combustion System B: As described for engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, compression chamber <b>5</b>-B accepts a charge as it rotates past port <b>14</b>-C. As back side of combustion chamber <b>5</b>-B is sealed by close proximity to rotor with back side of combustion chamber <b>5</b>-B, spark plug <b>12</b>-A ignites charge for power pulse. In System B, the charge is ignited, preferably by spark, the exploding gases now expand against leading vane <b>4</b> with the pressure contained on the back side by the closeness of the surface of stator <b>9</b> surface to the surface of the rotor <b>2</b>-B which can sealed by a sliding seal on rotor or stator. Therefore, the only expansion that can occur is against vane <b>4</b> as it extends as the space increases in expansion chamber <b>5</b>-E on the lead side. The volume of expansion space increases until vane <b>4</b> passes exhaust port <b>17</b> as the exhaust gases are expelled. The difference between compression ratios and the expansion ratio can be adjusted by changing the amount of air which is passes back from outlet port <b>12</b> to inlet port <b>3</b>-B of FIG. <b>27</b>. The engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> always operates with equal compression and expansion ratios, except when valve <b>14</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> allows part of the primary charge to return to inlet port <b>3</b>-B.</p>
  <p num="p-0549">The engine can be supercharged far beyond the density allowed by conventional engines while producing, with great turbulence, low peak temperatures and pressure, assuring very low polluting emissions.</p>
  <p num="p-0550">The temperature and pressure to and in the combustion chamber <b>5</b>′ and <b>5</b>-B can be adjusted by speed control of compressor <b>18</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, the amount of charge sent through or bypassed coolers <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> and compressor <b>18</b>, selectively utilizing bypass systems of components, with R valves being controlled by ECM-<b>27</b>. Friction is reduced to near zero due to close tolerance rollers and guide grooves and extension springs. Vane tips, which are preferably only three per rotor, will not touch stator surfaces, traveling with two mils clearance. Vane seals <b>10</b> are alternatively used with very light rubbing friction. The system described eliminates problems with rubbing surfaces. The engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> provides all of the advantages stated for the epitrochoid rotary engine of FIG. <b>24</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0551">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, there is shown a perspective view of one of two stator side or end-plates <b>24</b> of the internal combustion rotary engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, showing vane guide roller guide track <b>8</b>, drive shaft opening <b>7</b> and bearing assembly <b>6</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0552">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, there is shown a perspective view, with sections in cross-section and other sections schematically, of an internal combustion engine with rotor(s) rotating on a central axis having an elliptical stator and an elliptical path for vane tips which are guided to prevent rubbing against stator housing and which provide charge intake, compression, combustion and scavenging in a single rotor and stator for each power unit.</p>
  <p num="p-0553">The engine takes in a primary fuel-air charge characterized by having a low “effective” compression ratio and low heat-of-compression for that portion of charge followed by the injection of a supplementary, supercharging air portion late in the compression stroke. The secondary charge, also having a low “effective” compression ratio for low heat-of-compression producing totally very low heat-of-compression.</p>
  <heading>Method of Operation</heading> <p num="p-0554">The engine <b>1</b> receives the air or fuel-air mix in two portions from two different sources and are introduced at different times.</p>
  <p num="p-0555">1) For the supercharging air, a compressor <b>15</b> receives air through inlet port <b>16</b> and optionally mixes the air with fuel in carburetor <b>51</b>-C. The air or fuel-air charge is directed by conduit through intercooler <b>17</b>, through compressor <b>18</b>, intercooler <b>19</b>, conduit <b>20</b> to injection valve <b>21</b> which is alternatively an expansion valve such as <b>10</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-B</figref> and <b>2</b>-D. The secondary, supercharging air is highly compressed, cooled or “chilled” before injecting by valve <b>21</b> into the primary air stream late in the compression process of the primary air or fuel-air in compression chamber <b>5</b>-C. The late injection of the cool, high pressure, supercharging charge into the relatively cool primary charge assures great charge density, turbulence and efficiency for economical and enduring operation with ultra low polluting emissions.</p>
  <p num="p-0556">2) For the primary air, atmospheric or pressure boosted air of fuel-air mix is drawn into compression chamber <b>5</b>-C by way of air inlet port <b>3</b>-B by suction action as vane <b>4</b> rotates past air inlet <b>3</b>-B. If valve <b>14</b> on air return <b>13</b> is closed, compression begins as soon as vane <b>4</b> passes inlet port <b>3</b>-B.</p>
  <p num="p-0557">If valve <b>14</b> is slightly or somewhat open, part or all of the charge passed before vane <b>4</b> is returned to suction inlet of <b>3</b>-B, thus reducing the “effective” compression ratio even further than illustrated.</p>
  <p num="p-0558">The compression chamber <b>5</b>-C of the elliptical stator <b>8</b> is illustrated as being of lower volume than that of the expansion chamber <b>5</b>-E, therefore, always producing an “effective” compression ratio lower than the expansion ratio. Alternatively, both compression chamber <b>5</b>-C volume and expansion chamber <b>5</b>-E volume are equal for equal compression and expansion ratios. Any variation of these two volumes are within the scope of the invention. Air return conduit <b>13</b> and adjustable valve <b>14</b> allow the selective choice of compression ratios on engines with equal volumes of the two chambers or any variation ad infinitum.</p>
  <heading>Combustion Systems</heading> <p num="p-0559">Preparation and presentation of the air or fuel-air charge to a combustion chamber is similar for two different combustion systems.</p>
  <p num="p-0560">Combustion System A: The primary air charge is received and compression begins and continues as rotor <b>2</b> rotates preferably with the very low “effective” compression ratio described here for low heat-of-compression. During the compression process in chamber <b>5</b>-C, a vane <b>4</b>, in compressing its air charge, approaches inlet of <b>22</b> injector valve <b>21</b>, which is alternatively an expansion valve of type <b>10</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-B</figref> or <b>2</b>-D. Valve <b>21</b> opens and injects through port <b>22</b> a dense, cooled or “chilled” supercharging air into the flow of the cool primary air or fuel-air charge, just before vane <b>4</b> passes. Compression continues and as vane <b>4</b> nears outlet port <b>23</b>, which is fitted with a valve <b>25</b> which optionally is a one-way valve. The entire charge, initial and supercharge combined, is pressed through port <b>23</b> and valve <b>25</b> into combustion recess <b>5</b>′. (A seal <b>24</b> created by close proximity of rotor <b>2</b> and stator <b>8</b>, prevents compressed charge passing between rotor <b>2</b> and stator <b>8</b>, forcing it to pass into port <b>23</b> through valve <b>25</b>). As rotor motion continues, vane <b>4</b> rotates past stator recess <b>5</b>′ and combustion chamber <b>5</b>-A in rotor <b>2</b> as the charge is ignited by spark plug <b>12</b>-A or HCCI while chamber <b>5</b>-A is open to chamber <b>5</b>′. The combustion chamber <b>5</b>-A, as it passes opening to combustion recess <b>5</b>′ and is ignited, is sealed on its following side by seal <b>24</b>. The forward end of combustion<b>5</b>-A is sealed against pressure leak by the extending vane <b>4</b> and its optional vane seals <b>10</b>. The charge expands against vane <b>4</b> in chamber <b>5</b>-E, producing power, scavenging, air intake and compression of charge.</p>
  <p num="p-0561">Combustion System B: An alternate method of introducing and igniting the fuel-air charge of engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> is as follows: The chief difference in combustion system B is that the combustion chamber <b>5</b>-B (in phantom) in rotor <b>2</b> rotates past opening of combustion recess <b>5</b>′ in stator <b>8</b> until the combustion chamber <b>5</b>-B is filled with charge and the back side sealed by proximity with rotor <b>2</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>) and the charge is ignited by plug <b>12</b>-B.</p>
  <p num="p-0562">Both air charges have been prepared and during the compression process, the primary air charge has been combined with the supercharging air and together have been made more dense and cool by the injection of the supercharging air. Together, they have been pumped through port <b>23</b> into combustion recess <b>5</b>′, ready for induction into combustion chamber <b>5</b>-B. The combustion chamber <b>5</b>-B of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> (in phantom) in rotor <b>2</b>-B is immediately behind and opens on its leading end against vane <b>4</b>-B (also in phantom). Vane <b>4</b>-B rotates past combustion chamber opening <b>5</b>′ which opens to face of rotor <b>2</b> and opening of combustion chamber <b>5</b>-B, to inject charge into <b>5</b>-B. In this system, spark plug <b>12</b>-A, combustion chamber <b>5</b>-A and vane <b>4</b> are replaced by their counterparts <b>12</b>-B, <b>5</b>-B and <b>4</b>-B or can function in conjunction with them if spaced equal distance apart. Chamber <b>5</b>′ in stator <b>8</b> is open on the underside or has a port <b>5</b>″ slideably in contact with the outer surface of rotor <b>2</b>, which with the underside of chamber <b>5</b>′ being sealed by its proximity with rotor <b>2</b>, injects fuel-air charge into combustion chamber <b>5</b>-B as in rotating vane <b>4</b>-B passes port <b>5</b>″ to chamber <b>5</b>′ which opens to combustion chamber <b>5</b>-B to inject charge from port of chamber <b>5</b>′. Now, in the alternate system B, combustion chamber <b>5</b>-B has passed the opening to chamber <b>5</b>′ with the following end of combustion chamber <b>5</b>-B being sealed by close proximity of stator <b>8</b> inter surface and rotor <b>2</b> top surface, just after closure of chamber <b>5</b>-B by stator <b>2</b>. The leading end of combustion chamber <b>5</b>-B is sealed by further extension of vane <b>4</b>-B. At the point where the back-side of chamber <b>5</b>-B is sealed by the proximity of stator inter facing, the fuel-air charge is ignited by spark plug <b>12</b>-B, producing the power surge by providing pressure against vane <b>4</b>-B which has a larger surface area than the back side of combustion chamber <b>5</b>-B and is movable. Rotor <b>2</b> rotates with vane(s) <b>4</b>-B extending further into expansion chamber <b>5</b>-E, providing optionally an extended expansion ratio.</p>
  <heading>Method of Operation</heading> <p num="p-0563">Air is received by engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> from two sources and put into the engine combustion chamber at two different times and at two different pressure levels and temperatures.</p>
  <p num="p-0564">The primary charge enters compression chamber <b>5</b>-C of stator <b>8</b> at inlet port <b>3</b>-B as vane <b>4</b>-B rotates by inlet port <b>3</b>-B, drawing in air or fuel-air charge. If valve <b>14</b> in conduit <b>13</b> is open, even partly, some or all of the air pumped to that point is returned to inlet port <b>3</b>-B, further reducing the “effective” compression ratio of the engine, which when ignited, expands the charge to a larger than normal volume, producing an extended expansion ratio. The compression chamber <b>5</b>-C can be smaller than the expansion chamber as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> or the two chambers can optionally be equal in volume or the compression chamber <b>5</b>-C may be of larger volume. The first situation producing an expansion ratio greater than the compression ratio and with the equal volume chambers producing equal compression and expansion ratios, excepting that with equal or larger volume compression chamber <b>5</b>-C, if valve <b>14</b> is wholly or partly open, the compression chamber will selectively produce an “effective” compression ratio less than the expansion ratio for an extended expansion ratio.</p>
  <p num="p-0565">(The “effective” compression ratio is derived by dividing the volume of the expansion chamber by the volume of charge that produces heat during compression. That is, the volume of the compressing charge at the point where it begins to be compressed (producing heat), divided into the volume of the expansion chambers).</p>
  <p num="p-0566">The preferably low compression air or fuel-air charge is being compressed in compression chamber <b>5</b>-C. Some time during the compression process, preferably late, at a point before vane <b>4</b>-B passes supercharge inlet port <b>22</b>, a very dense, cooled or chilled air or fuel-air charge is injected into the compression chamber <b>5</b>-C ahead of vane <b>4</b>-B. Compression continues and the entire charge is compressed into port <b>23</b> through optional valve <b>25</b>. Adjacent surfaces of rotor <b>2</b> and stator <b>8</b> are sealed against gas pressure at point <b>24</b> to just past port to to combustion recess <b>5</b>′ and combustion chamber <b>5</b>-B, which follows adjacent to vane <b>4</b>-B, is filled with high pressure charge as rotor turns. In combustion system A, a one way valve <b>25</b> at channel <b>23</b> allows the charge to be ignited at the point the back side of combustion chamber <b>5</b>-A is sealed at point <b>24</b> by proximity of stator and rotor surfaces. The leading side of combustion chamber <b>5</b>-A is always sealed by extension of vane <b>4</b>. In combustion system B, the one way valve in channel <b>23</b> is optionally eliminated, allowing vane <b>4</b>-B to rotate past combustion recess <b>5</b>′ outlet <b>5</b>″ and combustion chamber <b>5</b>-B to be filled and the charge ignited as soon as back-side of combustion chamber <b>5</b>-B is sealed by stator <b>8</b> and rotor <b>2</b> inner surfaces meeting. The charge in system B is now expanding against the larger and less resistant surface vane <b>4</b>-B for the power pulse.</p>
  <p num="p-0567">In system A or B, the rotor is now rotating with vanes <b>4</b>, or <b>4</b>-B, extending further into compression chamber <b>5</b>-E. Then at near the point the vanes are completely retracted, the stator <b>8</b> and vanes <b>4</b> come together with rotor <b>2</b> and scavenge the power chamber of exhausted fuel-air charge through port <b>17</b> and conduit <b>18</b>. The exhaust is now preferably ducted by exhaust conduit <b>18</b> to drive turbine on turbo-charger <b>15</b> which pumps air into the engine's supercharging system.</p>
  <p num="p-0568">The total charge is now more dense than that of current engines, and with low“effective” compression ratios for both portions of charge is much cooler, producing greater power and torque and efficiency with ultra low polluting emissions.</p>
  <p num="p-0569">The supercharging portion of air may be “compression chilled” by expanding through an expansion valve <b>10</b> as described for engines of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-B</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-C</figref>. This further reduces polluting emissions and increases power.</p>
  <p num="p-0570">In all Designs, the first stage of compression of the supercharging air is followed by (a) air intercooler with optional bypass system consisting of a valve R and conduit X and (b) another compressor with its optional bypass system and (c) another intercooler with its optional bypass system. These are followed by a conduit <b>20</b> to convey the now dense and cool supercharging air or fuel-air charge to an injector valve <b>21</b> which injects the supercharging air through port <b>22</b> into the cool primary air charge during the compression process.</p>
  <p num="p-0571">Control valves R and injector valves <b>21</b> or <b>10</b> in all Designs are alternatively operated and controlled by signals received by ECM-<b>27</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> which then adjust valve controls to produce charge density and temperatures to that required for spark ignition or HCCI operation.</p>

  <heading>Doubly Compressed—Doubly Cooled</heading> <p num="p-0576">The chief difference in the engine construction operation from engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> is that only one source of air <b>3</b>-B is provided and the first stage of compression is accomplished in the engine compression chamber. In this engine, the compression chamber <b>5</b>-C is preferably the same volume or even greater than that of the expansion chamber <b>5</b>-E with port <b>14</b>″ and valve <b>14</b> with conduit <b>13</b> selectively varying the “effective” compression ratio in regard to power, torque, efficiency and emissions characteristics demands of the engine, all preferably controlled by ECM-<b>27</b> as described for engine of FIG. <b>2</b>. The expansion of this engine can be selectively varied from less than the compression ratio to much greater than the effective compression ratio.</p>
  <p num="p-0577">The engine is alternatively supercharged by pre-compressing the air entering inlet port <b>3</b>-B or by constructing the compression chamber with a much larger volume than that of the expansion chamber. Thus, the engine is supercharged while operating with valve <b>14</b> closed. If the port <b>14</b>′ is at a point of equal volume fully open, the compression ratio and expansion ratio would be equal. If volume of compression chamber <b>5</b>-C is higher and outlet port <b>14</b>′ is higher, opening valve <b>14</b>, more or less, variably or selectively, produces equal compression and expansion ratios or a low “effective” compression ratio with extended expansion ratio.</p>
  <p num="p-0578">In an alternate design, compressor <b>18</b> and intercooler <b>19</b> are eliminated and the charge, compressed in a single stage, is directed as shown after intercooling to compression recess through inlet valve <b>23</b>′ or by way of conduit <b>20</b>′ (in phantom) tp compression chamber <b>5</b>-C where the charge, now cooled, will be recompressed, perhaps with effective compression ratio of 2:1 or 3:1. The entire charge is then compressed into combustion recess <b>5</b>′ by way of port <b>23</b>″, also in phantom. The charge is then introduced into combustion chamber <b>5</b>-A or <b>5</b>-B, according to instructions for combustion systems A or B for engines of FIG. <b>30</b> and FIG. <b>31</b>.</p>
  <heading>Operation</heading> <p num="p-0579">Air or fuel-air charge is taken in at port <b>3</b>-B by suction of vane <b>4</b> on rotor <b>2</b> as the vane is rotated past port <b>3</b>-B. The “effective” compression ratio is selectively chosen by (a) the volume of the compression chamber <b>5</b>-C in regard to the need and the volume of the expansion chamber <b>5</b>-E, by (b) the point where port <b>14</b>′ is placed in the compression chamber or by (c) whether valve <b>14</b> is open and to what extent.</p>
  <p num="p-0580">If valve <b>14</b> is closed, compression begins as soon as vane <b>4</b> passes port <b>3</b>-B. If port <b>14</b> is open, compression begins after that point, and depending on how much charge is returned, compression continues and the entire charge is compressed into outlet and optional valve <b>21</b> to conduit <b>16</b>, which in turn conveys the charge to intercooler <b>17</b>, compressor <b>18</b>, intercooler <b>19</b>, by conduit <b>20</b> to air injector valve <b>22</b>, and the entire charge now being doubly compressed and intercooled is injected into recess <b>5</b>′ for induction into combustion chamber <b>5</b>-A or <b>5</b>-B and ignited as described for alternate combustion systems A and B of engine of FIG. <b>30</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0581">Also in this system, bypass valves R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2 </sub>and R<sub>3 </sub>with conduits X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2 </sub>and X<sub>3 </sub>are in the manner of valves <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> of engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, controlled by ECM-<b>27</b> to produce optimum temperature at the point of charge ignition for spark ignition or HCCI operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0582">In any engine of this invention, fuel is optionally carbureted or injected at any point feasible. After the air or fuel-air has been introduced into chamber <b>5</b>′, the operation of the engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> is the same as that of engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, utilizing alternate combustion system A or system B with components spark plug <b>12</b>-A, combustion chamber <b>5</b>-A and vane <b>4</b> being replaced by counter parts spark plug <b>12</b>-B, combustion chamber <b>5</b>-B and vane <b>4</b>-B. The two systems can be in conjunction with each other if spaced properly.</p>
  <p num="p-0583">In operating in system A in both <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30 and 31</figref>, valve <b>23</b>, which is optionally one-way, prevents charge back-flow or backfiring at the time charge ignition. Combustion chamber <b>5</b>-A and vane <b>4</b> are in the position shown and with combustion chamber <b>5</b>-A filled, the charge is ignited for the power surge, which also scavenges the chamber, induces and compresses a new charge which is pressed into chamber <b>5</b>′.</p>
  <p num="p-0584">In alternate system B, operation in engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30 and 31</figref>, the charge is introduced into combustion chamber <b>5</b>-B as it passes bottom port of chamber <b>5</b>′ and as shown with backside of combustion chamber <b>5</b>-B, sealed by proximity of stator and rotor interfaces and with vane <b>4</b>-B, by extension sealing the leading side of combustion chamber <b>5</b>-B, the charge is ignited by spark plug <b>12</b>-B for the power surge, producing three power surges per revolution and is scavenged, receives fresh air charge, compresses charge and loads chamber <b>5</b>′ for the next ignition.</p>
  <p num="p-0585">In either combustion system, A or B, there is an alternate system for engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> of introducing the charge from conduit <b>20</b> to combustion recess <b>5</b>′. Alternatively, conduit <b>20</b>, valve <b>23</b> and port <b>22</b> open into compression chamber <b>5</b>-C just after valve-port <b>21</b> and before port <b>23</b> in FIG. <b>30</b>. Now, optional port <b>23</b>″ in engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> conveys the air or fuel-air charge from compression chamber <b>5</b>-C into combustion recess <b>5</b>′. This is the same means of introducing the charge to recess <b>5</b>′ as done in engine of FIG. <b>30</b>. Thus, the doubly compressed and intercooled charge is now further compressed for perhaps an effective compression ratio of 2:1 or 3:1.</p>
  <p num="p-0586">The advantages of this engine are the same as those for engine of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> with only a little less power than that of engine receiving the supercharging portion of air from the external source.</p>
  <p num="p-0587">As described and depicted earlier for the engines of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24</figref>, <b>24</b>-B, <b>25</b> and <b>25</b>-B, the secondary or supplementary or doubly compressed air or fuel-air charge is alternatively as sole or supplementary charge, injected directly into the combustion chambers of engines of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24</figref>, <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>30</b> and <b>31</b> for all Operational Designs of the engines of this invention.</p>
