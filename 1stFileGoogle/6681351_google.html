An ATE system includes memory having a test application stored therein, a test interface to connect to the device, and a processor coupled to the memory and the test interface. The processor is configured to operate in accordance with the test application to (i) provide a series of instructions based on a test procedure defining a device testing task, and (ii) control the test interface based on the provided series of instructions in order to test the device. The test procedure includes multiple test elements. Each test element defines instructions and programmable input variables that direct the processor to perform a particular test operation of the device testing task. The user of the ATE system combines test elements when creating the test procedure rather than write code from scratch, or modify code of prewritten templates. Accordingly, the user does not need to possess knowledge of a programming language or low-level ATE component details.</div>

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The invention relates generally to automatic test equipment, and more particularly to techniques for controlling such equipment.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>In general, automatic test equipment (ATE) is equipment for testing devices (or complete systems) in an automated manner. Some ATE systems test electronic circuitry such as integrated circuits (ICs) or circuit boards. When a typical ATE system tests such a device (commonly referred to as the device under test or DUT), the ATE system applies stimuli (e.g., electrical signals) to the device and checks responses (e.g., currents and voltages) of the device. Typically, the end result of a test is either “pass” if the device successfully provides certain expected responses within pre-established tolerances, or “fail” if the device does not provide the expected responses within the pre-established tolerances. More sophisticated ATE systems are capable of evaluating a failed device to potentially determine one or more causes of the failure.</p>
    <p>It is common for an ATE system to include a computer that directs the operation of the ATE system. Typically, the computer runs one or more specialized software programs to provide (i) a test development environment and (ii) a device testing environment. In the test development environment, a user typically creates a test program, i.e., a software-based construct of one or more files that controls various portions of the ATE system. In the device testing environment, the user typically provides the ATE system with one or more devices for testing, and directs the ATE system to test each device in accordance with the test program. The user can test additional devices by simply providing the additional devices to the ATE system, and directing the ATE system to test the additional devices in accordance with the test program. Accordingly, the ATE system enables the user to test many devices in a consistent and automated manner based on the test program.</p>
    <p>In general, there are two conventional approaches to creating a test program using the test development environment of the ATE system: a code-based approach and a template-based approach. In the code-based approach, the user writes code in a programming language (e.g., the C or C++ programming languages) with extensions and libraries. In general, the code controls low-level operations of various components within the ATE system such as voltage and current sources, measuring devices, and data storage resources. Additionally, if multiple devices are to be tested in parallel, specific code must usually be added to control the additional ATE system components which are required to test the additional devices, substantially increasing program complexity. Accordingly, the code-based approach generally requires the user to posses extensive knowledge of a programming language and the various components of the ATE system. Typically, the developed code is several thousand lines long, and often requires significant time and effort to test and debug before formal device testing can begin.</p>
    <p>The code-based approach is powerful and flexible because it allows the user to utilize the resources of the ATE system to their fullest potential. Since the user essentially develops the test program from scratch by writing the code, the user can customize and tailor the test program to take full advantage of the ATE system. For example, the user may include certain optimizations in the test program to operate the ATE system in a manner that provides the quickest test times attainable and thus maximize the capacity of the ATE system. Additionally, the user is not bound to industry testing methods or standards. Rather, the user has the capability to establish and implement user-specific testing methods and standards which, in some respects, may be superior to industry norms. Moreover, the user can test as many different types of devices as appropriate for the ATE system's capabilities. This is particularly important with regard to testing mixed-signal devices which utilize both analog and digital signals, and where device-specific configuration is typically required before devices are ready to accept stimulus signals and provide response signals.</p>
    <p>In contrast to the code-based approach, the template-based approach is less burdensome on the user. In the template-based approach, the ATE system manufacturer supplies the user with a selection of test program templates. Each template typically includes code prewritten by the ATE manufacturer thus alleviating the need for the user to write code from scratch. Furthermore, such a template is generally customizable to a degree. For example, a particular test program template may allow the user to enter certain operating parameters that control particular actions performed by the ATE system when testing a device. It is also typical that a test program template can apply the customized operating parameters to multiple devices in parallel and make measurements from multiple devices in parallel. More extensive changes typically require the user to examine and edit the prewritten code if the ATE makes this underlying code accessible to the user. Accordingly, in the template-based approach, the task of the user is to select a template that is well-suited for the particular intended test, and to provide suitable operating parameters to the selected template in order to direct the ATE system to properly perform the intended test.</p>
    <p>In general, from the perspective of the user, the template-based approach is relatively easier to use than the code-based approach. In the template-based approach, the user takes advantage of prewritten test programs thus avoiding having to write code from scratch. Accordingly, the user does not require extensive knowledge of a programming language or low-level details of the ATE system. Rather, the user simply selects a prewritten template and sets particular operating parameters for the selected template to customize the operation of the ATE system. As such, the user essentially plays the role of an ATE operator rather than a test program developer.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Unfortunately, the code-based and template-based approaches to creating a test program have certain drawbacks. In particular, the code-based approach, in which a user writes a test program from scratch, requires the user to posses extensive knowledge of a programming language and low-level details of the various components of the ATE system. Without such knowledge the user would not be able to create a test program that properly operates the various portions of the ATE system to test a device. Furthermore, even with such knowledge, the task of creating the test program is complex and error-prone. Typically, the user invests a significant amount of time developing and debugging a test program before the test program is ready for regular use in device testing.</p>
    <p>The template-based approach, in which a user utilizes prewritten test program templates provided by the ATE manufacturer, suffers from certain drawbacks as well. First, this approach is relatively inflexible because the user can only choose from test program templates that the ATE manufacturer has conceived in advance. Such templates often cannot be customized to the extent necessary to test devices which have complex device-specific configuration requirements, such as mixed-signal devices.</p>
    <p>Second, some ATE users prefer to establish and implement their own user-specific methods and standards rather than rely on those provided by the ATE manufacturer. In some situations, it is difficult or impossible for such users to implement their own methods and standards by modifying prewritten templates since these templates typically only accept operating parameter changes. More extensive modifications usually entail working at a lower level by searching and editing the underlying template instructions, and verifying that no undesired changes have been made. Modifying and debugging such code can, on occasion, be a more difficult task than writing code from scratch.</p>
    <p>Third, as ATE manufacturers attempt to increase the flexibility and customizability of their templates, the templates tend to become more complex from the perspective of the user. In some situations, creating a test program by developing a proficiency in a prewritten template and then modifying that template may be a larger burden on the ATE user, than just writing a test program from scratch. In particular, the user may already possess some knowledge of a programming language and the components of the ATE system. Such a user would now have the burden of having to further learn the details of the manufacturer's test program template and then determine how to modify it.</p>
    <p>To avoid making test program templates too complex, ATE manufacturers may attempt to provide a wider selection of test program templates. Unfortunately, this becomes extremely burdensome on the ATE manufacturer, and it is often impossible for the manufacturer to anticipate and satisfy every need of the ATE system user with a test program template. For example, it is unrealistic to expect an ATE manufacturer to provide a separate template for every possible mixed-signal test arrangement (a device test which involves both analog and digital signals) due to the large number of different signal combinations. The manufacturer would likely not be able to complete such an undertaking in a timely manner. Moreover, the ATE system user likely would be overwhelmed by the selection of test program templates, and perhaps may not choose the best-suited test program template for a particular situation. Nevertheless, if the ATE manufacturer does not provide a template which is well-suited for a desired device test (e.g., one that is capable of handling the correct number of analog and digital signals of the intended device under test), the ATE user likely will be unable to effectively test the devices unless the user modifies a less-suitable template. Often such modifications require extensive code changes.</p>
    <p>In contrast to the above-described conventional code-based and template-based approaches to creating a test program, the invention is directed to techniques for providing a test procedure from multiple test elements. Each test element defines instructions and programmable input variables for a particular test operation. Preferably, each test element embodies the basic functionality of one of the ATE system's instruments or capabilities. The test procedure defines a device testing task and can operate as a test program, or be combined with other test procedures (or one or more instances of the same test procedure) to form a larger test program. Accordingly, the there is no need to write a test program code from scratch as in the conventional code-based approach. Furthermore, providing a test procedure from test elements generally provides greater flexibility than modifying prewritten test program templates since individual test operations defined by the test elements can be combined in a customized fashion to suit the particular needs of the ATE user.</p>
    <p>In one arrangement, the ATE user combines multiple test elements from a test element database to form a test procedure which defines a device testing task. Each test element defines instructions and programmable input variables that direct a processor to perform a particular test operation of the device testing task. The ATE user sets at least a portion of the programmable input variables of each test element forming the test procedure to initial values. Additionally, the ATE user indicates an operating order for the test elements forming the test procedure. Furthermore, the ATE user stores the test procedure within a memory. Accordingly, the ATE user can create a customized test program suitable for testing a specific device such as an IC or a circuit board. Furthermore, the ATE user is not burdened with writing code from scratch and does not need to possess extensive knowledge of a programming language or low-level details of the ATE components as is necessary in the code-based approach.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the ATE user has the capability to nest the test procedure within another test procedure. Such a nesting feature enables the ATE user to better organize the test program through modularization. Moreover, the ATE user may be able to reuse certain test procedures on other types of devices that are similar to the device for which the test procedure was originally created.</p>
    <p>Preferably, the test element database includes analog signal test elements which define instructions that direct the processor to perform analog signal test operations, digital signal test elements which define instructions that direct the processor to perform digital signal test operations, and other test elements which define instructions for configuring the DUT to receive and transmit stimulus and response signals. The task of combining these analog signal test elements, digital signal test elements, and DUT configuration test elements to form a mixed-signal test procedure or test program is, in many respects, easier than trying to convert a mixed-signal template designed to handle a particular set of signals and DUT configuration requirements, as is sometimes necessary in the conventional template-based approach to effectively test a mixed-signal device.</p>
    <p>After the ATE user creates a test procedure from test elements, an ATE system can use the test procedure to test a device. In particular, when the user begins a formal device test, the user enters commands on an input/output (I/O) device of the ATE system to begin a test. In response, a processor of the ATE system obtains the test procedure from memory, and provides a series of instructions based on the test procedure. In response, the processor controls a test interface, which connects (e.g., electrically or mechanically) with the device under test, based on the provided series of instructions in order to test the device.</p>
    <p>Preferably, the ATE system provides a graphical user interface (GUI) through the I/O device. The user operates the GUI to create the test procedure from test elements of the test element database. In particular, the user preferably selects graphical icons corresponding to respective test elements, and arranges the icons in an editor window of the GUI to provide an operating order for the test elements. Additionally, the user sets programmable input variables of the test elements to initial values using dialog boxes which vary depending on the operation defined by the test element. The underlying instructions for the test operations which define the test elements is preferably prewritten by the ATE manufacture so that the user can simply manipulate icons and enter parameter values. Hence, the user has the power and flexibility of the code-based approach since the user creates a test program (or test procedure) from scratch, but is does not require extensive knowledge of a programming language or low-level details of ATE components since the user is not writing lines of code from scratch.</p>
    <p>It should be understood that the test elements of the test procedure are preferably arranged so that information resulting from one test element of the test procedure can be used by another test element. That is, when the ATE system operates in accordance with the test procedure during a device test, the test operation results from one test element are used by the other test element. For example, one test element can direct the ATE to take measurements from a device under test. A subsequent test element can process these measurements to determine whether the device operates properly.</p>
    <p>It should be further understood that the processor preferably includes multiple processing units that are associated with respective multiple devices. In this arrangement, controlling the test interface involves operating each of the multiple processing units based on the provided series of instructions to test each of the respective multiple devices in parallel. This arrangement enables the ATE system to be scaled by increasing the number of processing units within the processor. It should be farther understood that preferably a test procedure and its test elements automatically test as many devices in parallel as are presented to the test interface, in contrast to a conventional code-based test program which normally requires significant modification in order to test different numbers of devices in parallel.</p>
    <p>Another arrangement of the invention is directed to a computer program product that includes a computer readable medium having instructions stored thereon for performing the above-described test procedure. The instructions, when processed by a data processing device, cause the data processing device to combine test elements from a test element database to form the test procedure in response to user commands such that the test procedure (i) defines a device testing task, and (ii) includes multiple test elements. The instructions further cause the data processing device to (i) set at least a portion of the programmable input variables of each test element forming the test procedure to initial values, (ii) indicate an operating order for the test elements forming the test procedure, and (iii) store the test procedure within a memory, in response to further user commands.</p>

The instructions, when processed by a data processing device, cause the data processing device to obtain a test procedure which defines a device testing task. The test procedure includes multiple test elements defining instructions and programmable input variables that direct the processor to perform particular test operations of the device testing task. The instructions further cause the data processing device to provide a series of instructions based on the test procedure, and control the test interface based on the provided series of instructions in order to test the device.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p>The invention is directed to techniques for providing a test procedure from multiple test elements for use in automatic test equipment (ATE). The test procedure defines a device testing task, and each test element defines instructions and programmable input variables for a particular test operation of the device testing task., Each test element preferably embodies the basic functionality of one of the ATE system's instruments or capabilities. The test procedure may be used as an ATE test program or combined with other test procedures (or instances of the same test procedure) to form a larger ATE test program. Accordingly, such techniques alleviate the need to create ATE test programs by writing code from scratch as in a conventional code-based approach, or by modifying templates as in a conventional template-based approach. Such techniques may be employed in ATE systems and other related devices such as those manufactured by Teradyne, Inc. of Boston, Mass.</p>
    <p>FIG. 1 shows an ATE system <b>20</b> which is suitable for use by the invention. The ATE system <b>20</b> includes memory <b>22</b>, an input/output (I/O) device <b>24</b>, a processor <b>26</b> having multiple processing units <b>27</b>, and a test interface <b>28</b>. The arrows <b>30</b> of FIG. 1 represent information (i.e., signals) exchanged between the memory <b>22</b>, the I/O device <b>24</b>, the processor <b>26</b> and the test interface <b>28</b>. Another ATE system which is suitable for use by the invention, and which is similar to the ATE system <b>20</b> of FIG. 1, is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,910,895 (Proskauer et. al.), the teachings of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 1, the memory <b>22</b> stores various constructs including, among other things, an operating system <b>32</b>, a test application <b>34</b>, a test element database <b>36</b>, and a test program <b>38</b>. The test program <b>38</b> includes test procedures <b>40</b>-<b>1</b>, . . . , <b>40</b>-M (collectively, test procedures <b>40</b>). Each of the test procedures <b>40</b> includes multiple test elements <b>42</b>. For example, test procedure <b>40</b>-<b>1</b> includes test elements <b>42</b>-<b>1</b>, . . . , <b>42</b>-N.</p>
    <p>One or more of the above-listed constructs in the memory <b>22</b> can be provided to the memory <b>22</b> through a computer program product <b>44</b> (e.g., one or more diskettes or tapes). Preferably, the test application <b>34</b> and the test element database <b>36</b> are provided by the manufacturer of the ATE system <b>20</b> to an ATE end-user via such a computer program product <b>44</b>. Alternatively, these constructs can be provided to the memory <b>22</b> via other mechanisms (e.g., downloaded through a network interface, not shown) or created by an ATE user operating the ATE system <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p>The ATE system <b>20</b> operates in accordance with the operating system <b>32</b> and the test application <b>34</b> (i.e., one or more software programs coordinated by the operating system <b>32</b>) to provide a user with a test development environment and a device testing environment. The test application <b>34</b> provides a graphical user interface (GUI) on the I/O device <b>24</b> enabling a user (i) to create the test program <b>38</b> (i.e., one or more test procedures <b>40</b>) when operating within the test development environment, and (ii) to test devices <b>46</b>-<b>1</b>, . . . , <b>46</b>-X (collectively, devices <b>46</b>) in accordance with the test program <b>38</b> when operating within the device testing environment.</p>
    <p>As described above, each test procedure <b>40</b> includes multiple test elements <b>42</b>. Preferably, each test element <b>42</b> is a modularized, prewritten grouping of instructions and variables provided by the manufacturer of the ATE system <b>20</b>. Initially, these groupings are centrally stored in the test element database <b>36</b>.</p>
    <p>In one arrangement, when a user creates a test procedure <b>40</b> from multiple test elements <b>42</b>, the user copies the actual groupings of instructions and variables for the multiple test elements <b>42</b> from the test element database <b>36</b> into a location of the memory <b>22</b> designated for storing the test procedure <b>40</b>. In this arrangement, the test procedures <b>40</b> are essentially self-contained in that each test procedure <b>40</b> includes all of the instructions and variables necessary for directing the ATE system <b>20</b> to perform a particular device testing task.</p>
    <p>In another arrangement, when the user creates a test procedure <b>40</b> from multiple test elements, the user adds test element references and variable values (represented as test elements <b>42</b> shown in FIG. 1) to the test procedure <b>40</b>. The test element references are essentially pointers to the test element instructions and variables which remain centrally stored in the test element database <b>36</b>. In this arrangement, at device testing time, the ATE system <b>20</b> retrieves the instructions and variables for the test elements <b>42</b> based on the test element references, and uses the earlier-provided variable values as initial values for the variables. This arrangement uses less memory space than the earlier-described self-contained arrangement. Furthermore, when revisions and improvements are made to a particular test element <b>42</b>, i.e., when a change is made to the instructions of variables of the particular test element <b>42</b>, each test procedure <b>40</b> referencing that test <b>42</b> is automatically capable of accessing the change.</p>
    <p>It should be understood that, in either the self-contained arrangement or the test element reference arrangement, the test procedures <b>40</b> are considered to include the test elements <b>42</b> since the groupings of instructions and variables for each test element <b>42</b> is retrieved from the test element database <b>36</b> at some point in both arrangements. In the self-contained arrangement, the groupings are retrieved at test procedure creation time. In the test element reference arrangement, the groupings are retrieved at device testing time.</p>
    <p>It should be further understood that the invention overcomes drawbacks of the conventional code-based and template-based approaches to creating a test program. In particular, the user of the code-based approach needs to write code from scratch to create a test program. Such code writing is unnecessary with the invention. Rather, the user of the invention combines test elements (i.e., prewritten groupings of instructions and variables) to create a test program <b>38</b>. The test program <b>38</b> can be just as powerful and flexible as one created using the code-based approach since the user of the invention can select test elements <b>42</b> best-suited for performing particular test operations to form a custom-tailored test procedure <b>40</b> for performing a particular device testing task. Furthermore, multiple test procedures <b>40</b> can be combined to perform multiple device testing tasks for a device test.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, it should be understood that the user of the template-based approach often needs to edit underlying prewritten code to customize a template for an effective device test. Such an undertaking is often difficult if the user is not knowledgeable in the programming language of the template. Such a modification is unnecessary with the invention. Rather, the user of the invention can combine suitable test elements <b>42</b> (preferably, by arranging graphical icons on a GUI, as will be explained shortly) and providing variable values to create a test program <b>38</b>. Each of these test elements <b>42</b> can test different numbers of devices in parallel without modification. Accordingly, the user does not need to wrestle with any underlying code.</p>
    <p>FIG. 2 illustrates a general comparison, from the perspective of a user, of the test program <b>38</b> of the invention, a typical test program <b>50</b> created using the conventional code-based approach, and a typical test program <b>52</b> created using the conventional template-based approach. As shown in FIG. 2, the test program <b>38</b> of the invention is generally more flexible than the template-based test program <b>54</b>. In particular, with the ATE system <b>20</b> of the invention, the user can test as many different types of devices as appropriate for the ATE system's capabilities. The user is not limited by the prewritten temple choices provided by the ATE manufacturer as in the template-based approach.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, a user creating the test program <b>38</b> of the invention can simply combine test elements <b>42</b> from the test element database <b>36</b>. No code modifications are necessary to create the test program <b>38</b>. In contrast, in the template-based approach, code modifications are often required for an effective device test if no well-suited templates are provided by the ATE manufacturer. Unfortunately, extensive code modifications are generally difficult and require significant testing and debugging before regular testing can begin since the user has to locate and rewrite portions of the template without corrupting the operation of other related or adjacent template portions.</p>
    <p>Additionally, as shown in FIG. 2, from the perspective of the user, the test program <b>38</b> of the invention is generally less complicated to create than the code-based test program <b>50</b>. To create the test program <b>38</b> of the invention, the user works at a level above actual code, and combines test elements <b>42</b> (prewritten groupings of instructions and variables) and provides initial values to form a test procedure <b>40</b> or multiple test procedures <b>40</b> for the test program <b>38</b>. Knowledge of a programming language and the low-level details of the ATE components are not required to create the test program <b>38</b>. On the other hand, in the code-based approach, the user must possess knowledge of a programming language and low-level details of the various components of the ATE system. Additionally, once a user creates the test program <b>50</b> using the code-based approach, the user generally must spend considerable time and effort testing and debugging code statements within the test program <b>50</b>.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, it is likely that the code-based test program <b>50</b> is not as well organized as the test program <b>38</b> of the invention since any organizational controls over a user-written test program result from self-imposed controls. That is, there is no guarantee that the code-based test program <b>50</b> will be modularized, well-organized or easy to debug. On the other hand, the test program <b>38</b> of the invention naturally takes a modular structure due to the arrangements of test elements <b>42</b> forming test procedures <b>40</b>, and one or more test procedures <b>40</b> forming a test program <b>38</b>. Moreover, if the test program <b>38</b> uses references to test elements <b>42</b> within the test element database <b>36</b> and if a revision or improvement is made to a particular test element <b>42</b>, the ATE system <b>20</b> propagates that change to the test program <b>38</b> of the invention and every other test program <b>38</b> and test procedure <b>40</b> using that test element <b>42</b>. Hence, in general, the test program <b>38</b> of the invention is less complex from the user's perspective than the code-based test program <b>50</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring again to FIG. 2, from the perspective of the user, the test program <b>38</b> of the invention is generally easier to use than the code-based test program <b>50</b>. The test program <b>38</b> of the invention utilizes a standardized interface (e.g., a GUI) regardless of the particular device test. Moreover, in one arrangement, the test program <b>38</b> is controlled and launched from a common standard spreadsheet program. One spreadsheet program that is suitable for such use is Microsoft Excel, which is manufactured by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. Accordingly, an operator of the ATE system <b>20</b> does not need to learn a new interface for every different device test.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, the code-based test program <b>50</b> typically uses a unique user interface since the code-based test program <b>50</b> is handwritten exclusively for testing a particular device. Accordingly, an ATE test operator must learn a new interface for each new code-based test program <b>50</b>. Hence, the code-based test program <b>50</b> is generally less easy to use than the test program <b>38</b> of the invention.</p>
    <p>Further details of the invention will now be provided with reference to FIG. <b>3</b>. The test application <b>34</b> has a number of components including, among others, a graphical user interface (GUI) <b>60</b>, a test program builder <b>62</b> and a test program interpreter <b>64</b>. The test program interpreter <b>64</b> includes, among other things, a program manager <b>66</b> and a runtime debugger <b>72</b>.</p>
    <p>Although the following description of the test application components may describe the components as performing particular operations for simplicity, it should be understood that the processor <b>26</b> actually performs these operations under direction of the components. That is, each test application component directs the processor <b>26</b>, perhaps in conjunction with one or more other portions of the ATE system <b>20</b>, to perform such operations.</p>
    <p>The GUI <b>60</b> operates (through the I/O device <b>24</b>) as a front-end for the test application <b>34</b>. That is, the GUI <b>60</b> prompts the user of the ATE <b>20</b> for commands and data, and provides the commands and data to the test program builder <b>62</b> and the test program interpreter <b>64</b>. Additionally, the GUI <b>60</b> receives responses to the user commands and data from the test program builder <b>62</b> and the test program interpreter <b>64</b>, and displays the responses as feedback to the user on the I/O device <b>24</b>.</p>
    <p>The test program builder <b>62</b> is responsible for building the test program <b>38</b> in the test development environment. As shown in FIG. 3, the test program builder <b>62</b> accesses the test element database <b>36</b> to build the test program <b>38</b>. In particular, commands provided by the user through the GUI <b>60</b> direct the test program builder <b>62</b> to combine and arrange test elements to create one or more test procedures <b>40</b>. An instance of each test procedure <b>40</b> can operate as a test program <b>38</b> itself, or combine with other test procedures <b>40</b> or instances of the same test procedure <b>40</b> to form a larger test program <b>38</b>.</p>
    <p>The test program interpreter <b>64</b> is responsible for device testing based on the test program <b>38</b> in the device testing environment. In particular, the program manager <b>66</b> interprets test element instructions of the test elements forming the test procedures <b>40</b> of the test program <b>38</b>, and performs the low-level operations needed to perform the device test. In particular, the test program interpreter <b>64</b> transforms the test element parameters into small sequences of test actions and coordinates operation of the processing units <b>27</b>. The user can remain ignorant of these low-level details. Further details of the operation of the various test application components will be provided shortly.</p>
    <p>FIG. 4 shows, by way of example, a window <b>80</b> of the test development environment that is suitable for use by the ATE system <b>20</b>. The window <b>80</b> includes menu <b>82</b> and toolbar <b>84</b> which operate in a conventional manner to enable a user to enter commands to perform particular tasks (e.g., to create or store a test procedure).</p>
    <p>The window <b>80</b> further has a number of subwindows. In particular, the window <b>80</b> includes a test procedure editor subwindow <b>86</b> that graphically displays (e.g., in a top-down iconic format) an arrangement order for multiple test elements <b>42</b> of the current test procedure <b>40</b>. In the example, the current test procedure <b>40</b> begins with a “Pattern” test element as shown by the “Pattern” icon, which is followed by a “PPMU” test element as shown the “PPMU” icon, and so on. The test element order can be modified by adding, inserting, or deleting test element icons. Furthermore, the test element order can be modified by changing arrows connecting the test element icons to provide loops or branches in the flow. Accordingly, the user can construct complex, conditional procedure flows to accomplish complex testing tasks.</p>
    <p>The window <b>80</b> further includes an input value subwindow <b>88</b> which prompts the user to input values and/or variable names required by a particular test element <b>42</b>. As shown in FIG. 4, by way of example, the “PPMU” test element is selected in the test procedure editor subwindow <b>86</b> as shown by the boxed outline around the “PPMU” icon, and the subwindow <b>88</b> prompts the user to enter required values for “PPMU” test element. By way of example only, the user has entered (e.g., via a keyboard or mouse) a value of “0.00001” in a field <b>90</b> which corresponds to a “Max Expected Current” variable of the “PPMU” test element.</p>
    <p>The window <b>80</b> further includes a variable table subwindow <b>92</b> which provides the user with an overview of the variables used by the test procedure <b>40</b>, and their properties. The user can change particular property values used by the test procedure <b>40</b> by simply selecting a field of the variable table subwindow <b>92</b> (e.g., using a mouse of the I/O device <b>22</b>), and entering a new property value in that field.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5 shows, by way of example only, how the window <b>80</b> of the test development environment can change based on input from the user. In particular, suppose that the user selects another test element of the flow within the test procedure editor subwindow <b>86</b> of the window <b>80</b> (also see FIG. <b>4</b>). In response, the user will see window <b>94</b> on the I/O device <b>22</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>5</b>. Window <b>94</b> is similar to window <b>80</b>, except that window <b>94</b> includes a modified test procedure editor subwindow <b>86</b>′ which shows the icon of the newly selected test element highlighted or boxed (i.e., the “Limits &amp; Datalog” icon), rather than the earlier selected icon. Furthermore, the subwindow <b>88</b> of window <b>80</b> is replaced with a new subwindow <b>96</b> corresponding to the newly selected test element.</p>
    <p>The above-described window-based presentation arrangement makes the use of test elements superior to general purpose programming tools. For example, the test element specific windows <b>88</b> and <b>96</b> indicate to the user what information is needed. Accordingly, the user does not need to consult reference material or posses extensive experience with the ATE system <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p>When the user is finished adding test elements <b>42</b> to the test procedure <b>40</b>, the user may wish to set certain variables to initial values. For example, the user may wish to perform one test an a device using a voltage supply of 3.5 volts, and then repeat the test on the same device using a voltage supply of 5.0 volts. To accommodate the user, the ATE system <b>20</b> allows the user to create multiple instances of the test procedure <b>40</b> (one for each test). To this end, the user enters commands into the GUI <b>60</b>, and the ATE system <b>20</b> prompts the user to create multiple instances of the test procedure <b>40</b>, distinguishing each instance by a unique identifier (e.g., an instance name or number). FIG. 6 shows, by way of example only, an instance editor window <b>100</b> which prompts the user to enter values for a particular instance of the test procedure <b>40</b>. Accordingly, the user can develop the test program <b>38</b> so that it performs variations of the same test on the same device using multiple instances of the same test procedure <b>40</b>.</p>
    <p>It should be understood that the ATE system <b>20</b> of the invention is easy to use when creating the test procedure <b>40</b> since the user simply retrieves test elements (i.e., test element icons representing the desired test elements) from the test element database <b>36</b>, and arranges them and initializes their input variables. The user does not need to write or modify any code as in conventional approaches to creating a test program. Nevertheless, the ATE system <b>20</b> has the capability to show the instructions and variables defined by a test element <b>42</b> if the user wishes to see them. For example, the user can direct the ATE system <b>20</b> to display the instructions and variables using the menu <b>82</b> or toolbar <b>84</b>. As shown in FIG. 7, the ATE system <b>20</b> responds by showing the user a window <b>106</b> having the instructions and variables <b>108</b> defined by a selected test element <b>42</b>.</p>
    <p>Further details of the operation of the ATE system <b>20</b> will now be provided with reference to FIGS. 8 and 9. FIG. 8 shows a flow diagram of a procedure <b>110</b> performed by the ATE system <b>20</b>. The procedure includes design-time steps <b>112</b> which are performed when the ATE system <b>20</b> operates in the test development environment, and run-time steps <b>114</b> which are performed when the ATE system operates in the device testing environment.</p>
    <p>In step <b>116</b>, the ATE system <b>20</b> accesses the test element database <b>36</b> to create a test procedure <b>40</b>. In particular, as shown in FIGS. 4 through 6, the GUI <b>60</b> and the test procedure builder <b>62</b> enables the user to combine test elements <b>42</b> from the test element database <b>36</b>, set values for their variables, and order the test elements relative to each other to create the test procedure <b>40</b>. Optionally, the user may include one or more previously created test procedures <b>40</b> in the test procedure <b>40</b> presently being created.</p>
    <p>In step <b>118</b>, the ATE system <b>20</b> (i.e., the GUI <b>60</b> and test procedure builder <b>62</b>) provides the user with the choice of creating additional test procedures. If the user directs the ATE system <b>20</b> to create another test procedure <b>40</b>, step <b>118</b> proceeds back to step <b>116</b>. Otherwise, step <b>118</b> proceeds to step <b>120</b>.</p>
    <p>In step <b>120</b>, the ATE system <b>20</b> forms an instance of the earlier-created test procedure <b>40</b>. The user provides input into the instance editor window <b>100</b> (see FIG. 6) to set initial values for use during device testing.</p>
    <p>In step <b>122</b>, the ATE system <b>20</b> stores, in the memory <b>22</b>, the test procedure instance <b>40</b>. Hereinafter, the test procedure instance <b>40</b> will be referred to as the test procedure <b>40</b> for simplicity. It should be understood that the ATE system <b>20</b> can handle multiple instances of the test procedure <b>40</b>. Step <b>122</b> then proceeds to step <b>124</b> (the beginning of the device testing environment).</p>
    <p>In step <b>124</b>, the ATE system <b>20</b> provides a series of instructions based on the test procedure <b>40</b>. In one arrangement where the test procedure <b>40</b> includes references to test element instructions stored within the test element database <b>36</b>, the program manager <b>66</b> of the test procedure interpreter <b>64</b> retrieves the instructions from the test element database <b>36</b>. In another arrangement where the test procedure <b>40</b> includes actual instructions and variables for each test element <b>42</b> forming the test procedure <b>40</b>, the program manager <b>66</b> obtains the instructions by simply reading portions of the test procedure <b>40</b> from the memory <b>22</b>. In both arrangements, the program manager <b>66</b> transforms the series of instruction into a sequence of operations which are performed by each of the processing units <b>27</b> of the processor <b>26</b>.</p>
    <p>In step <b>126</b>, each processing unit <b>27</b> of the processor controls the test interface <b>28</b> to test a respective device <b>46</b>. For example, the processing units <b>27</b> may apply or measure signals <b>48</b> of the devices <b>46</b>. The simultaneous operation of the processing units <b>27</b> enables the ATE system <b>20</b> to test multiple devices in parallel automatically.</p>
    <p>Further details of the activities of the user, when creating the test procedure <b>40</b>, will now be provided with reference to FIG. <b>9</b>. When the user operates the ATE system <b>20</b> to create the test procedure <b>40</b>, the user performs a procedure <b>130</b> using the GUI <b>60</b> and the test program builder <b>62</b> of the test application <b>34</b>.</p>
    <p>In step <b>132</b>, the user retrieves a test element from the test element database <b>36</b>. For example, for a mixed-signal device, the user may select one of an analog source test element, a digital source test element, an analog sample test element, a digital sample test element, etc.</p>
    <p>In step <b>134</b>, the user provides information about the order of operation of the retrieved test element relative to any other test elements that have been added to the test procedure <b>40</b>. Preferably, the user arranges test element icons within a test procedure editor window of the GUI <b>60</b> (e.g., see subwindow <b>6</b> of FIG. <b>4</b>). For example, the user may order the most recently retrieved test element after a previously retrieved test element.</p>
    <p>In step <b>136</b>, the user sets programmable input variables for any of the test elements <b>42</b> of the test procedure <b>40</b>. For example, the user may enter variable names for the most recently retrieved test element <b>42</b> using a subwindow of the GUI <b>60</b> (e.g., see subwindow <b>88</b> of FIG. <b>4</b>). Furthermore, the user may configure a previously retrieved test element <b>42</b> to provide results into the most recently retrieved test element <b>42</b>, for example by using the procedure variables defined in the variable table subwindow <b>92</b>. This configures the test elements <b>42</b> to pass information among themselves automatically. Preferably, this is done with procedure variables which hold multiple values, one for each DUT to be tested in parallel.</p>
    <p>In step <b>138</b>, the user determines whether to add another test element <b>42</b> to the test procedure <b>40</b>. If the user wishes to add another test element <b>42</b>, the user repeats steps <b>132</b> through <b>136</b>. Otherwise, the user proceeds to step <b>140</b>.</p>
    <p>In step <b>140</b>, the user creates an instance editor for each test procedure <b>40</b>. In particular, in response to user input through the GUI <b>60</b>, the test program builder <b>62</b> analyzes the test procedure <b>40</b> to determine which programmable input variables of the test elements <b>42</b> require initial values prior to device testing. In one arrangement, the test program builder <b>62</b> examines information used within the variable table subwindow <b>92</b> (see FIGS. 4 and 5) to identify the programmable input variables that require initial values. The ATE system <b>20</b> then creates the instance editor window <b>100</b> to prompt the user to provide the required initial values (see FIG. <b>6</b>). The user can then create one or more instances of the test procedure <b>40</b> for device testing (see step <b>120</b> in FIG. <b>8</b>). Since the instance editor prompts the user to provide the initial values needed by the test procedure <b>40</b> for device testing, the user does not need to look up such requirements in manuals or rely on prior experience using the test procedure <b>40</b>.</p>
    <p>It should be understood from the above-provided description that the techniques of the invention enable a user to create a test procedure <b>40</b> for use as a test program <b>38</b> itself, or for use with other test procedures <b>40</b> (or multiple instances of the same test procedure) to form a larger test program <b>38</b> without drawbacks of conventional approaches to creating a test program. In particular, the user combines test elements which define groupings of instructions and variables into an ordered arrangement which directs the ATE system <b>20</b> to perform a device test on one or more devices <b>46</b>. The ATE system <b>20</b> is easy to use, does not require expert knowledge of the low-level ATE instruments and components or a programming language, and is flexible so that the user can direct how he or she wants to use the ATE system's resources. The features of the invention may be particularly useful in computerized devices manufactured by Teradyne, Inc. of Boston, Mass.</p>
    <heading>EQUIVALENTS</heading> <p>While this invention has been particularly shown and described with references to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
    <p>For example, the I/O device <b>22</b>, the memory <b>22</b> and the processor <b>24</b> may form portions of a general purpose computer (e.g., mainframe, workstation, distributed computing system, etc.), or form a specialized ATE device. The memory <b>22</b> may include both primary memory (e.g., semiconductor memory), secondary memory (e.g., disk or tape memory), other storage media (e.g., CDROM, network servers, etc.), or a combination different memory types. Additionally, the I/O device <b>24</b> may include multiple input and output devices such as one or more displays, keyboards, printers, mice, etc.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, although the processor <b>26</b> is shown to include multiple processing units <b>27</b>, the processor <b>26</b> may be implemented as a single processor that multiplexes time to test each device <b>46</b> connected to the test interface <b>28</b> at any given time. Alternatively, the processor <b>26</b> may have a multiprocessor configuration or a distributed processing configuration which controls the multiple processing units <b>27</b> respectively associated with the multiple devices <b>46</b>. Various interconnection mechanisms (e.g., a computer bus, backplane, etc.) are suitable for handling the information exchange <b>30</b> between the various components of the ATE system <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p>In the context of testing ICs or circuit boards, the test interface <b>28</b> may include probes or pins for making electrical contact with the devices <b>46</b>. In other contexts, the test interface <b>28</b> may include a variety of devices specific to those contexts. For example, to mechanically test a device, the test interface may include force application and measuring devices.</p>
    <p>Additionally, it should be understood that the ATE system <b>20</b> does not necessarily require each test procedure <b>40</b> to include multiple test elements <b>42</b>. Rather, a test procedure <b>40</b> can include a single test element <b>42</b>. However, the test procedures <b>40</b> preferably include multiple test elements <b>42</b> due to their naturally provided organizational benefits (i.e., modularizing instructions and variables into groupings which perform a particular test operation).</p>
    <p>Furthermore, it should be understood that the user can disable one or more of the processing units <b>27</b> of the processor when the ATE system <b>20</b> operates at less than full capacity. For example, if the user wishes to test a single device <b>46</b>, the user can configure the ATE system <b>20</b> to operate only one processing unit <b>27</b> to test that device <b>46</b>.</p>
