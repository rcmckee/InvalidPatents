    <p>60/398,881 filed on Jul. 25, 2002</p>
    <p>60/398,859 filed on Jul. 25, 2002</p>

    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading> <p>1. Field</p>
    <p>The claimed invention relates to communications of computer networks. More specifically, it relates to a method and system for prepaid billing for wireless mobile services in communications networks.</p>
    <p>2. Description of Related Art</p>
    <p>In legacy prepaid billing scenarios, control of user access to the network is performed by elements of the Signaling System 7 (SS7) network. To enable such services, wired networks have adopted te advanced intelligent network (“AIN”) approach. The AIN approach provides for centrally located call control information and call processing logic, including the logic for prepaid billing, and a set of standardized messages between the network elements for accessing and using prepaid services, among other things.</p>
    <p>Wireless telecommunications networks have been developed on a similar model. In some legacy wireless networks, the switching of calls and the signaling for call control may be performed by mobile switching centers (MSCs). Each MSC typically controls one or more base stations or base transceiver stations (BTSs), sometimes via one or more base station controllers (MSCs). Each BTS provides a wireless coverage area within which wireless mobile nodes, such as mobile phones, personal digital/data assistants, and other mobile devices, can communicate with the BTS over an air interface. Alternatively, the functions of the MSC may be integrated into or integral to the BSC, thereby eliminating the MSC. In such case, the functions performed by the MSC may be performed by one or more BSCs.</p>
    <p>Each wireless mobile node typically has a “home” wireless network in which a home location register (HLR) serves as a centralized repository of information about the wireless mobile node. Typically, the HLR contains a user profile for the wireless mobile node, the last reported location of the mobile station, and the current status of the mobile station, such as whether it is active or inactive. The user profile may also contain indications or attributes of the enhanced services to which the wireless mobile node subscribes. Further, the user profile may be cataloged by the Mobile Identification Number (MIN), the dialed number, the Mobile Directory Number (MDN), the wireless mobile node's unique 32-bit Electronic Serial Number (ESN), or any other wireless mobile node identifier.</p>
    <p>When an MSC (or alternatively a BSC) needs to find information about a wireless mobile node, such as where it is located or what services it subscribes to, it queries the HLR corresponding to that wireless mobile node. Thus, to inquire about a wireless mobile node prepaid services, the MSC or BSC queries the HLR.</p>
    <p>In a manner analogous to the AIN approach used in wireline networks, an MSC or a BSC may also query a Wireless Intelligent Network (“WIN”) device for call processing instructions, in the course of either originating a call from or terminating a call to the wireless mobile node. Such queries can arise from trigger points set by the wireless mobile node's service profile that the MSC or BSC downloaded from the wireless mobile node's HLR. Moreover, the MSC or BSC use such queries to obtain the call processing instructions needed to provide enhanced telecommunications services to the wireless mobile node. In response to such queries, the WIN network devices will typically execute the appropriate service logic and consult the wireless mobile node's service profile to formulate the call processing instructions that the WIN network devices then send to the MSC.</p>
    <p>This is acceptable for voice services since-the Home Location Register (HLR) controls authorization of voice services. Units of use in the voice networks are typically time-based. And since voice activity inherently involves the SS7 network, the draw down of the usage units is reported to the HLR on a regular basis, which can provide for reasonable accounting of the usage.</p>
    <p>Today, second generation (“2G”) networks provide communication services to mobile nodes. These 2G networks have their foundation in older circuit-switched or packet-switched technologies that make the transmission of video and data quite slow, and thus, limit the type of multimedia, video and data services that can be used. In addition to the 2G networks, newer second-and-a-half generation (“2.5G”) network services are currently providing communication services to mobile nodes. These 2.5G networks use newer packet-switched services, which allow for increased transmission speeds for video and data as compared to 2G networks. Like the 2G networks, current 2.5G networks have similar limitations on the types of multimedia, video, and data services that can be used.</p>
    <p>Mobile nodes may take advantage of third generation (“3G”) network services, which allow for significantly faster data rates that in turn allow for a broader range of multimedia, video and data services to be used on a roaming mobile node. The 3G networks provide packet switched services with the capability of providing Internet Protocol traffic, such as Mobile Internet Protocol (“Mobile IP”) traffic; symmetrical and asymmetrical data rates; multimedia services such as video conferencing and streaming video; international roaming among different 3G operating environments; and more. Typical 3G systems include packet-based transmission of digitized voice, data and video. 3G networks encompass a range of wireless technologies such as Code Division Multiple Access (“CDMA”), Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service (“UMTS”), Wide-band CDMA (“WCDMA”), and others.</p>
    <p>In 3G networks, communications originating and terminating from mobile nodes may use Mobile IP to establish a voice, video and/or data call from a mobile node that has roamed from its home network to a foreign network. Mobile IP allows mobile nodes to transparently move between different Internet Protocol sub-networks (“subnets”). For a mobile node to use the services of the network, it has to connect to its home subnet. The home subnet provides access to an external network, such as the Internet, through a “home agent” that serves as the subnet's gateway router.</p>
    <p>To register on the 3G network, the mobile node may periodically transmit “agent solicitation” messages to the home agent. The mobile node also listens for “agent advertisement” messages from the PDSN. When a mobile node receives an agent advertisement message it registers with the PDSN that sent the agent advertisement message.</p>
    <p>To provide services to the mobile node when the mobile node “roams,” (i.e., dynamically changes its physical location), the mobile node periodically transmits “agent solicitation” messages to other gateway routers, and also listens for “agent advertisement” messages from the other gateway routers. When a mobile node receives an agent advertisement message indicating that it is now on a foreign subnet, it registers with the foreign gateway router or “foreign agent,” and with its home agent. The registration with the foreign agent allows the mobile node to receive data on the foreign subnet. Whereas, the concurrent registration with the home agent provides an indication to the home subnet that the mobile node is not at home. This may allow for forwarding to the foreign subnet the data directed to the mobile node received on its home subnet.</p>
    <p>As noted above, 2G and later networks provide packet data services in addition to the current voice services. Further, migration of voice services to a Voice over IP model complicates matters because the packet data network may and most likely will become the carrier for voice traffic, in contrast to the current circuit based mechanism, where voice traffic is controlled by SS7 and/or Wireless Intelligent Network (WIN) elements.</p>
    <p>However, there are several problems associated with establishing voice, video or data calls on 3G networks. One problem is that users currently cannot easily buy, use or replenish prepaid services, such as pre-paid calling accounts on mobile nodes some 3G networks. Such problems occur when legacy billing systems do not work on 3G networks, or the provider of the 3G networks access will not undertake providing 3G services to high-risk users. Further, without prepaid billing systems, large delays in receiving payments and/or bills can result in suspension or discontinuation of a user's 3G network services. And after fees are paid, it may be difficult for users of mobile nodes on to re-establish service, when pre-paid billing systems are not implemented.</p>
    <p>Moreover, without prepaid billing system in 3G networks, providers may have difficulty in disconnecting active users of mobile nodes when outstanding fees are owed. This difficulty is further complicated when the active users of the mobile nodes are constantly roaming from one foreign network to another because usage on each of the foreign networks may not be reported until a later date. In such case, it is possible for a user to overuse the amount of allotted network services. Conversely, users may be overcharged for actual usage if multiple network elements charger for the same service. While the aforementioned issues are common to both the data and voice services, the growth of data services and the demand for prepaid services in global markets will result in a need to satisfy these deficiencies.</p>
    <p>Packet data traffic in the 3G networks are typically served to wireless mobile nodes by a Packet Data Serving Node (“PDSN”). The PDSN provides the same type of call control responsibility in the packet data network that the HLR provides in the circuit voice WINs network. Unlike the HLR, however, for the mobile nodes that it serves, packet data traffic may pass through the PDSN. Being in the packet-data-traffic path allows the PDSN to directly monitor and measure the usage of the wireless prepaid service. The PDSN need not be in the packet-data-traffic path, however, because the PDSN may receive usage information from another PDSN over a PDSN to PDSN link. Further details regarding inter-PDSN transfer are provided by co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 10/097796, filed on Mar. 14, 2002, and titled “Method and System for Re-Direction and hand-off for Pre-Paid Mobile Services in Third Generation Networks,” which is fully incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <p>Current 3G network models presently suffer from having (i) no mechanism for tracking the consumption or usage of prepaid wireless services in near real time (e.g., most systems have monthly bill reconciliation); (ii) no mechanism for varying the measurement unit (in near real time) for the type of data, (e.g., time units for voice services and/or byte units for data services); (iii) no mechanism for scaling the usage measurement unit (in near real time) on foreign or brokered networks to provide “marking-up” or discounting of services when on a brokered network or foreign network; and (iv) inadequate mechanisms for conveniently handing-off an ongoing communication session.</p>
    <p>Thus, it is desirable to provide a method and system to support prepaid accounting and billing services that work correctly with mobile nodes on 3G networks.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY</heading> <p>According to one embodiment, a method for providing roaming and hand-off support for prepaid billing for wireless prepaid services on a data network for wireless prepaid services may be carried out by a first-network-access device, such as a PDSN, carrying on session activity of a wireless communication session with a wireless mobile node within a first coverage area. A second-network-access device establishes connectivity with the wireless mobile node after the wireless mobile node moves into the second-network-access device's coverage area. In response to moving into the coverage area of the second-network access device, the first-network-access device tunnels the session activity to the second-network-access device.</p>
    <p>Before and after tunneling the session activity, the first-network-access device receives from a network-access-control device one or more block of credits, which may be drawn from a user account having a cache of available credits. Each of these blocks of credits may be all of the credits or less than all of the credits in the cache of available credits.</p>
    <p>In addition, the first-network-access device may also receive one or more measurement-method parameters with each block of credits. These measurement-method parameters may include an indication for determining the usage units for the wireless communication session.</p>
    <p>After receiving a block of credits and the measurement-method parameters, the network-access device periodically measures usage of the session activity for the wireless communication session. The first-network-access device may measure the usage of the session activity while the wireless mobile node is in the first coverage area in terms of a first of the measurement-method parameters. Additionally, the first-network-access device may measure the usage of the session activity tunneled to the second-network-access device in terms of a second of the measurement-method parameters. The first of the measurement-method parameters, however, may be the same as the second of the measurement-method parameters.</p>
    <p>While session activity is ongoing, the first-network-access device debits the usage of the session activity from the blocks of credits. While the credits in the received blocks remain above a predetermined threshold, the first-network-access device may continue to debit the session activity from the blocks of credits.</p>
    <p>In another embodiment, the first-network-access device carries on or engages in session activity for a wireless communication session with a wireless mobile node within a first coverage area. The first-network-access device receives from the network-access-control device one or more blocks of credits, which may be drawn from a user account having a cache of available credits. Each of these blocks of credits may be all of the credits or less than all of the credits in the cache of available credits.</p>
    <p>In addition, the first-network-access device may also receive one or more measurement-method parameters with each block of credits. These measurement-method parameters may include an indication for determining the usage units for the wireless communication session.</p>
    <p>After receiving a block of credits and the measurement-method parameters, the first-network-access device periodically measures usage of the session activity for the wireless communication session. The first-network-access device may measure the usage of the session activity while in the first coverage area in terms of a first of the measurement-method parameters.</p>
    <p>While session activity is ongoing, the first-network-access device debits the usage of the session activity from the blocks of credits. While the credits in the received blocks remain above a predetermined threshold, the first-network-access device may continue to debit the session activity from the blocks of credits.</p>
    <p>Sometime during the wireless communication session, but after the wireless mobile node moves into a second coverage area, a second-network-access device requests network access from the network-access-control device for the session activity of the wireless communication session. After receiving network access, the second-network-access device establishes the session activity for the wireless communication session. While the mobile node operates in the second coverage area, the second-network-access device receives from the network-access-control device one or more blocks of credits.</p>
    <p>In addition, the second-network-access device may also receive one or more measurement-method parameters with each block of credits. Like the measurement-method parameters received by the first-network-access device, if any, these parameters the may include an indication for determining the usage units for the wireless communication session.</p>
    <p>After receiving a block of credits and measurement-method parameters, the second-network-access device periodically measures usage of the session activity for the wireless communication session. The second-network-access device may measure the usage of the session activity while the wireless mobile node is in the second coverage area in terms of a second of the measurement-method parameters, which may differ from the first of the measurement-method parameters. The first of the measurement-method parameters, however, may be the same as the second of the measurement-method parameters.</p>
    <p>The second-network-access device debits the usage of the session activity from the blocks of credits it receives. The second-network-access device may continue to debit the session activity from the blocks of credits while the credits in the received blocks remain above a predetermined threshold.</p>
    <p>After the second-network-access device establishes the session activity for the wireless communication session, the first-network-access device may receive from the network-access-control device a first indication that causes the first-network-access device to stop debiting the usage of the session activity from the blocks of credits. This indication may be, for example, a stop accounting message, or a terminate session activity message.</p>
    <p>The first-network-access device may also receive from the network-access-control device a second indication that causes the first-network-access device to return any remaining (i.e., unused) credits to the network-access-control device. These unused credits may be returned to the cache of available credits or reallocated to the session activity on the second-network-access device or any other eligible session activity.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, after the second-network-access device establishes the session activity for the wireless communication session, the first-network-access device may request from the network-access-control device an additional block of credits. In response, the first-network-access device receives from the network-access-control device another indication that causes the first-network-access device to stop debiting the usage of the session activity from the first block of credits, and/or return any remaining credits to the network-access-control device. As before, these remaining credits may be returned to the cache of available credits or reallocated to the session activity on the second-network-access device or any other eligible session activity.</p>
    <p>In another alternative, the first-network-access device may not receive from the network-access-control device a responsive indication to the request for additional block of credits. Without the responsive indication and upon expiry of remaining credits, session activity on the first-network-access device may terminate. In yet another alternative, when the first-network-access device does not receive from the network-access-control device a responsive indication to the request for additional block of credits, it may terminate the session activity, and return any unused credits to the network-access-control device.</p>
    <p>In another embodiment, the first-network-access device carries on session activity of a wireless communication session with a wireless mobile node within a first coverage area. The first-network-access device receives from a network-access-control device one or more blocks of credits, which may be drawn from a user account having a cache of available credits. Each of these blocks of credits may be all of the credits or less than all of the credits in the cache of available credits.</p>
    <p>In addition, the first-network-access device may also receive one or more measurement-method parameters with each block of credits. These measurement-method parameters may include an indication for determining the usage units for the wireless communication session.</p>
    <p>After receiving a block of credits and the measurement-method parameters, the first-network-access device periodically measures usage of the session activity for the wireless communication session. The first-network-access device may measure the usage of the session activity while in the first coverage area in terms of a first of the measurement-method parameters.</p>
    <p>While session activity is ongoing, the first-network-access device debits the usage of the session activity from the blocks of credits. The first-network-access device may continue to debit the session activity from the blocks of credits while the credits in the received blocks remain above a predetermined threshold.</p>
    <p>Sometime during the wireless communication session, but after the wireless mobile node moves into a second coverage area, a second-network-access device establishes connectivity with the wireless mobile node. In response, the first-network-access device tunnels the session activity and any unused credits to the second-network-access device.</p>
    <p>In addition, the second-network-access device may also receive from the first-network-access device one or more measurement-method parameters with each block of credits. Like the measurement-method parameters received by the first-network-access device, if any, these parameters the may include an indication for determining the usage units for the wireless communication session.</p>
    <p>After receiving the tunneled credits, tunneled measurement-method parameters, and tunneled session activity, the second-network-access device periodically measures usage of the tunneled session activity for the wireless communication session. The second-network-access device may measure the usage of the tunneled session activity while in the second coverage area in terms of a second of the tunneled measurement-method parameters, which may differ from the first of the measurement-method parameters. The first of the measurement-method parameters, however, may be the same as the second of the tunneled measurement-method parameters. While in the second coverage area, the second-network-access device debits the usage of the tunneled session activity from the tunneled unused credits.</p>
    <p>The second-network-access device may request network access from the network-access-control device for the session activity of the wireless communication session during a state transition in the session activity or at any other time. After receiving network access, the second-network-access device establishes independent network access for the session activity. In addition to receiving independent network access for the tunneled session activity, the second-network-access device receives from the network-access-control device one or more blocks of credits. The second-network-access device may also receive one or more measurement-method parameters with each block of credits. These measurement-method parameters received may include an indication for determining the usage units for the wireless communication session.</p>
    <p>Thereafter, the second-network-access device periodically measures the usage of the session activity. The second-network-access device may measure the usage of the session activity after establishing independent network access in terms of a third of the measurement-method parameters, which may, but need not, differ from the first and the second of the measurement-method parameters.</p>
    <p>The second-network-access device debits the usage of the session activity from the blocks of credits it receives. The second-network-access device may continue to debit the session activity from the blocks of credits while the credits in the received blocks remain above a predetermined threshold.</p>
    <p>After the second-network-access device establishes independent network access, the first-network-access device may receive from the network-access-control device a first indication, such as a terminate session activity message, that causes the first-network-access device to stop debiting the usage of the session activity from the first block of credits, and/or that causes the first-network-access device to return any remaining (i.e., unused) credits to the network-access-control device. These unused credits may be returned to the cache of available credits or reallocated to the session activity on the second-network-access device or any other eligible session activity.</p>
    <p>In a preferred embodiment, the first network-access device is carrying on session activity for a wireless communication session with a mobile node. The first network-access device has been allocated a block of credits by the network-access-control device. The mobile node roams to a second coverage area and initiates a session with a second network-access device. The second network-access device requests from the network-access-control device network access to support handoff activity of the wireless communications session. The network-access-control device retrieves from the first network-access device at least some of any remaining credits, then grants a new block of credits to the second network-access device. If desired, the first network-access device may also terminate its session in combination with its return of the remaining credits.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading> <heading>1. Exemplary Architecture for Prepaid Billing</heading> <p>FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary network system <b>10</b> in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. The network system <b>10</b> includes one or more local network devices <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. More or fewer local network devices can also be used. Each of the local network devices may be assigned network addresses (e.g., 11.0.0.x) on a local subnet <b>26</b>. The local subnet <b>26</b> includes, but is not limited to, a wireless network, a wired network, a wireless or wired LAN, an optical network or a cable network. However, other computer networks can also be used.</p>
    <p>The local subnet <b>26</b> is connected to an external network <b>28</b>, such as the Internet or an intranet, via gateway router <b>22</b>. The gateway router <b>22</b> may connect local subnet <b>26</b> to other computer networks using different networking protocols or operating at different transmission capacities. The gateway router <b>22</b> may also translate the data of a communication session between differing network protocols, and may provide for routing data (in the form of data packets) to an appropriate network node or network device. Local network devices on the local subnet <b>26</b> can reach one or more remote network devices on foreign subnets <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, via the external network <b>28</b>.</p>
    <p>Exemplary network devices include those that can interact with network system <b>10</b> and with the exemplary mobile network system illustrated in FIG. <b>3</b>. Further, these exemplary network devices can communicate with the system <b>10</b> and the system illustrated in FIG. 3 according to all or selected portions of standards proposed by (i) the Data-Over-Cable-Service-Interface-Specification (“DOCSIS”) standards from the Multimedia Cable Network Systems (“MCNS”), (ii) the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (“IEEE”), (iii) International Telecommunications Union-Telecommunication Standardization Sector (“ITU”), Telecommunications Industry Association (“TIA”), (iii) Internet Engineering Task Force (“IETF”), (iv) Wireless Application Protocol (“WAP”) Forum, (v) the Third Generation Partnership Project <b>2</b> (“3GPP2”) and/or (vi) the Third Generation Partnership Project (“3GPP”) standards. Network devices based on other standards, however, may also be used.</p>
    <p>DOCSIS standards can be found on the World Wide Web at the Universal Resource Locator (“URL”) “www.cablemodem.com.” IEEE standards can be found at the URL “www.ieee.org.” The ITU, (formerly known as the CCITT) standards can be found at the URL “www.itu.ch.” TIA standards can be found at the URL “www.tiaonline.org.” IETF standards can be found at the URL “www.ietf org.” The WAP standards can be found at the URL “www.wapforum.org.” The 3GPP standards may be found at the URL “www.3gpp.org.” The 3GPP2 standards may be found at the URL “www.3gpp2.org.”</p>
    <p>Each network device may contain a processing system with at least one high speed Central Processing Unit (“CPU”), data storage, and memory. Furthermore, an operating system may manage the resources of each network device. The data storage may include computer readable medium devices such as magnetic disks, optical disks, organic memory, and/or any other volatile (e.g., Random Access Memory (“RAM”)) or non-volatile (e.g., Read-Only Memory (“ROM”)) mass storage systems. The data storage may be concentrated or, conversely, it may be distributed. Data maintained by network devices may be stored in the concentrated data storage as well as in the distributed data storage.</p>
    <heading>2. Exemplary Protocol Stack</heading> <p>FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary layered-protocol stack for communication sessions originating and terminating from mobile and non-mobile network devices used in the exemplary network system <b>10</b> (FIG. 1) and in the exemplary mobile network system illustrated in FIG. <b>3</b>. The layered-protocol stack <b>40</b> is described with respect to Internet Protocol (IP) suites comprising from lowest-to-highest, a link, a network, a transport and an application layer. The layered-protocol stack <b>40</b>, however, may contain more or fewer layers may be used. Layer designations other than those of the IP suite may be used for the layers in the protocol stack <b>40</b>, as well. For example, layering based on the seven layer Open Systems Interconnection (“OSI”) model may be used.</p>
    <p>The layered-protocol stack <b>40</b> provides a way to connect one network device to another using an underlying physical transmission medium comprising a wireless network, wired network, wireless or wired LAN, an optical network, a cable network, and/or any other computer network. The underlying physical transmission medium, which may be referred to as a physical layer (not illustrated in FIG. <b>2</b>), defines the electrical and physical properties of an underlying transmission medium.</p>
    <p>Link layer <b>42</b> provides a connection mechanism for network devices to the underlying physical transmission medium or physical layer. The link layer <b>42</b> includes a Medium Access Control (“MAC”) protocol layer <b>44</b>, which controls access to the underlying transmission medium via a physical layer. For more information on the MAC layer protocol, see IEEE 802.3. IEEE 802.3 is fully incorporated herein by reference. Link layer <b>42</b>, however, is not limited to the MAC layer protocol <b>44</b>, and other link layer protocols may be used. (e.g., other IEEE 802.x protocols).</p>
    <p>The link layer <b>42</b> also includes a Point-to-Point Protocol (“PPP”) layer <b>45</b> (referred to hereinafter as PPP <b>45</b>). Generally, in operation, PPP <b>45</b> encapsulates higher-level protocols in PPP headers for transporting communications. PPP <b>45</b> may be used to provide dial-up access over a serial communications link, and to provide synchronous as well as asynchronous communications. Details on PPP <b>45</b> may be found at Internet Engineering Task Force (“IETF”) Request for Comments (“RFC”), RFC-1661, RFC-1662 and RFC-1663, all of which are fully incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <p>Above the link layer <b>42</b> is a network layer <b>46</b> (also called the “Internet Layer” for Internet Protocol suites). The network layer <b>46</b> includes an internet protocol (“IP”) layer <b>48</b>, which uses an IP addressing protocol designed to route traffic within a network and between networks. IP layer <b>48</b> (referred to hereinafter IP <b>48</b>) is described in IETF RFC-<b>791</b>, and is fully incorporated herein by reference. As will be described below, the IP <b>48</b> contains support for Mobile IP.</p>
    <p>The network layer <b>46</b> also includes an Internet Group Management Protocol (“IGMP”) layer <b>50</b>, an Internet Control Message Protocol (“ICMP”) layer <b>52</b>. IGMP layer <b>50</b>, hereinafter IGMP <b>50</b>, is responsible for multicasting. For more information on IGMP <b>50</b>, see IETF RFC-1112, which is fully incorporated herein by reference. ICMP layer <b>52</b>, hereinafter ICMP <b>52</b>, is used for Internet Protocol control. The main functions of ICMP <b>52</b> include error reporting, reachability testing (e.g., “pinging”), route-change notification, performance, subnet addressing and other maintenance. Details regarding ICMP <b>52</b> may be found in IETF RFC-792, which is fully incorporated herein by reference. ICMP <b>52</b> can be used without IGMP <b>50</b>. Both ICMP <b>52</b> and IGMP <b>50</b> are not required in protocol stack <b>40</b>.</p>
    <p>The network layer <b>46</b> may also include a Generic Routing Encapsulation (“GRE”) layer (not illustrated). GRE is a protocol for performing encapsulation of data from one arbitrary network layer protocol in another arbitrary network layer protocol. Details regarding GRE may be found in IETF RFC-1701-1702, which is fully incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <p>Above network layer <b>46</b> is a transport layer <b>54</b>. The transport layer <b>54</b> includes a Transmission Control Protocol (“TCP”) layer <b>56</b> and/or a User Datagram Protocol (“UDP”) layer <b>58</b>. The TCP layer <b>56</b>, hereinafter TCP <b>56</b>, provides a connection-oriented, end-to-end, reliable protocol designed to fit into a layered hierarchy of protocols which support multi-network applications. TCP <b>56</b> provides for reliable inter-process communication between pairs of processes in network devices attached to distinct, but interconnected networks.</p>
    <p>The UDP layer <b>58</b>, hereinafter UDP <b>58</b>, provides a connectionless mode of communications using datagrams in an interconnected set of computer networks. UDP <b>58</b> provides a transaction oriented datagram protocol, where delivery and duplicate packet protection are not guaranteed. Both TCP <b>56</b> and UDP <b>58</b> are not required in protocol stack <b>40</b>. And either TCP <b>56</b> or UDP <b>58</b> can be used without the other.</p>
    <p>Above the transport layer <b>54</b> is an application layer <b>60</b>. The application layer <b>60</b> may include one or more application programs <b>62</b>. These application programs <b>62</b> provide to a network device desired functionality, such as telephony or other communications functionality. The application programs <b>62</b> may include voice, video, audio, data or other applications. The application layer <b>60</b> may also include application-layer-protocol layers. These application-layer-protocol layers typically provide a subset of the functionality provided by an application program.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, the application layer <b>60</b> includes a Mobile IP application program <b>62</b>. For Details regarding Mobile IP see “Mobile IP: The Internet Unplugged,” by J. D. Solomon, Prentice-Hall, 1998, ISBN-0-13-856246-6. See also Mobile IP, as defined by IETF RFCs 2002-2006, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <p>The application layer <b>60</b> may also include a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (“DHCP”) application program <b>62</b>, which provides a mechanism/standard for passing configuration information such as IP <b>48</b> addresses to network devices on an IP <b>48</b> network and other networks. For more information on DHCP see, RFC-1541, and RFC-2131 and RFC-2132, which are fully incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <p>The application layer <b>60</b> may also include a Service Location Protocol (“SLP”) application program <b>62</b>, which provides a scalable framework for the discovery and selection of network services. Using SLP, network devices using the Internet need little or no static configuration of network services for network based applications. For more information on SLP see IETF RFC-2608, which is fully incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <p>The application layer <b>60</b> may also include a Session Initiation Protocol (“SIP”) application program <b>62</b>, which is an application-layer <b>60</b> control protocol for creating, modifying, and terminating sessions with one or more participants. SIP sessions may include Internet multimedia conferences, Internet telephone calls (e.g., Voice over IP, “VoIP”), and multimedia distribution. Members in a SIP session can communicate via multicast or via a mesh of unicast relations, or a combination of these. SIP invitations used to create sessions carry SIP session descriptions, which allow participants to agree on a set of compatible media types.</p>
    <p>SIP supports user mobility by proxying and re-directing requests to a mobile node's current location. Consequently, mobile nodes can register their current location. Furthermore, SIP is not tied to any particular conference control protocol. SIP is designed to be independent of a lower-layer transport protocols, and SIP may be extended. For more information on SIP, see IETF RFC-2543, “SIP: Session Initiation Protocol”, the contents of which are incorporated by reference.</p>
    <p>The application layer <b>60</b> may also include ITU-T H.323 or H.324 application programs <b>62</b>. H.323 is the main family of video conferencing recommendations for IP networks. The ITU-T H.323 standard is fully incorporated herein by reference. H.324 is a video conferencing recommendation for using plain-old-telephone-service (“POTS”) lines. The ITU-T H.324 standard is incorporated by reference.</p>
    <p>The application layer <b>60</b> may also include a VoIP application program <b>62</b>, which in turn may include several other application programs <b>62</b>, such as H.323 and SIP. The VoIP application program <b>62</b> converts a voice signal into a stream of packets, such as IP <b>48</b> packets, for transmission into a packet network. The VoIP application <b>62</b> may also convert the stream of packets back into a voice signal.</p>
    <p>VoIP services typically provide connectivity to traditional circuit-switched voice networks. As noted above, VoIP is typically used with the H.323 protocol and other multimedia protocols. H.323 terminals such as multimedia computers, handheld devices, personal digital/data assistants (“PDA”) or other devices, such as mobile phones connect to existing wired and wireless networks, such as PSTNs, private wired and wireless networks, and public wireless networks.</p>
    <p>H.323 terminals may be LAN-based end terminals for voice transmission. H.323 terminals may support real-time, two-way voice communications. H.323 terminals implement voice transmission functions and may include at least one voice Coder-Decoder (“CODEC”) for sending and receiving packetized voice. Examples of such CODECs include (i) Pulse Code Modulation (PCM), (ii) Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM), (iii) Code-Excited Linear Predictive (CELP), (iv) Adaptive Code-Excited Linear Predictive (ACELP), (v) Relaxed Code-Excited Linear Predictive (RCELP), (vi) Selective Mode Vocoder (SMV), (vii) Linear Predictive Coding (LPC), (viii) Sinusoidal Transform Coder (STC), (ix) Improved Multiband Excitation (IMBE), (x) CDMA Qualcomm Code-Excited Linear Predictive (QCELP), (xi) CDMA4000-SMV, (xii) Adaptive Multirate GSM (AMR-GSM), (xiii) Federal Standard 1017, (xiv) IS-54, (xv) IS-641, and/or other CODEC, such as those found in ITU-T CODECS, G.711, G.723, G.726, G.728, G.729.</p>
    <p>The application layer <b>60</b> may also include a Domain Name System (“DNS”) application program <b>62</b>, which provides replicated distributed secure hierarchical databases for hierarchically storing resource records under domain names. The application layer <b>60</b> may also include an Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (“AAA”) application program <b>62</b>. AAA application programs <b>62</b> provide a classification scheme and exchange format for providing accounting data records (e.g., for call billing, etc.). For more information on AAA applications, see, “Accounting Attributes and Record Formats,” IETF RFC-2924, the contents of which are fully incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <p>AAA applications include, but are not limited to, “Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)” described in IETF RFC-2865, or the DIAMETER protocol, which is used for AAA for Mobile-IP, described in IETF draft&lt;draft-calhoun-diameter-impl-guide-04.txt&gt; entitled “DIAMETER Implementation Guidelines,” July 2000, and IETF draft&lt;draft-calhoun-diameter-mobileip-11.txt&gt;, entitled “DIAMETER Mobile IP Extensions,” September 2000, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Other protocols or implementations, and other or equivalent AAA protocols can be used as well.</p>
    <p>The application layer <b>60</b> may also include a Simple Network Management Protocol (“SNMP”) application program <b>62</b>, which is used to support network management functions. For more information on SNMP layer <b>62</b> see IETF RFC-1157, which is fully incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, one or more of network devices may be configured as act as an application server by distributing one or more of the application programs <b>62</b> among the network devices. In another embodiment, a single network device may be the application server. Examples of such application servers include SIP servers, H.323 servers, AAA servers, DNS servers, VoIP servers, and/or any other type server. In such an embodiment, network devices may include only an application program layer (e.g., SIP) that communicates with an application program (e.g., SIP) running on the stand-alone application server to provide application functionality. Other or equivalent embodiments may be used as well.</p>
    <heading>3. Mobile IP</heading> <p>Mobile IP allows “mobile” nodes to transparently move between different IP sub-networks. Mobile IP allows a mobile node to dynamically change its network connectivity in a manner that is transparent to protocol layers above the network layer <b>46</b> (e.g., TCP <b>56</b> or UDP <b>58</b>). In an exemplary embodiment, support for Mobile IP application programs <b>62</b> or Mobile IP application layers is included in the IP <b>48</b> layer.</p>
    <p>FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary Mobile IP system <b>64</b>. The Mobile IP system <b>64</b> includes one or more “non-mobile” network devices <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>, <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, <b>76</b>, and a mobile node <b>78</b>. Hereinafter the mobile node <b>78</b> is called “mobile node <b>78</b>.” The Mobile IP System <b>64</b>, however, may include hundreds or thousands of mobile nodes. More or fewer non-mobile network devices and more mobile nodes may be used as well.</p>
    <p>The non-mobile network devices <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>, <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, <b>76</b>, and the mobile node <b>78</b> are assigned a network addresses, such as IP <b>48</b> addresses on a home subnet <b>80</b>. The home subnet <b>80</b> may include a wireless network, a wired LAN, an optical network, a cable network, and/or other computer network. The home subnet <b>80</b> is communicatively coupled to an external network <b>82</b>, such as the Internet or an intranet, via a home agent (“HA”) <b>76</b>. The HA <b>76</b> may provide a “gateway router” function for the home subnet <b>80</b>.</p>
    <p>When mobile node <b>78</b> “roams” <b>84</b> from its home subnet <b>80</b>, it periodically transmits Mobile IP “agent solicitation” messages to foreign agents, such as foreign agent (“FA”) <b>86</b> via external network <b>82</b>. The FA <b>86</b> is foreign with respect to home subnet <b>80</b> and resides on a foreign subnet <b>88</b> along with one or more foreign non-mobile network devices such as non-mobile network device <b>90</b> and <b>92</b>. The foreign subnet <b>88</b> may also include one or more mobile nodes (not illustrated). Like the HA <b>76</b>, the FA <b>86</b> provides a gateway router function for the foreign subnet <b>88</b>. The foreign non-mobile network devices <b>90</b> and <b>92</b> are assigned network addresses, such as IP <b>48</b> addresses, on the foreign subnet <b>88</b>.</p>
    <p>In addition to transmitting “agent solicitation” messages while roaming, mobile node <b>78</b> listens for Mobile IP “agent advertisement” messages from foreign agents, such as such as FA <b>86</b>. When roaming, mobile node <b>78</b> receives an agent advertisement message from FA <b>86</b> indicating that it is now on a foreign subnet <b>88</b>. At some point, the mobile nodes <b>78</b> registers with the FA <b>86</b> and the HA <b>76</b>. By registering with the HA <b>76</b>, the mobile node <b>78</b> notifies the HA <b>76</b> that it has roamed <b>84</b> away from its home subnet <b>80</b>.</p>
    <p>On home subnet <b>80</b>, mobile node <b>78</b> has a network address, such as IP <b>48</b> address 11.0.0.4., and the HA <b>76</b> has a network address, such as IP <b>48</b> address 11.0.0.7. Mobile and non-mobile network devices having network addresses beginning with a network access prefix of 11.0.0 and a prefix length of 24 bits (i.e., 11.0.0.X/24) belong to home subnet <b>80</b>. Since the HA <b>76</b> is advertising a route to the home subnet <b>80</b> at 11.0.0.X/24, it will accept data packets from external network <b>82</b> for network addresses with the network access prefix 11.0.0X/24. For example, the HA <b>76</b> may accept data packets for the mobile node <b>78</b>, given that the home network address of the mobile node <b>78</b> is of 11.0.0.4.</p>
    <p>The FA <b>86</b>, on the other hand, has a network address of 12.0.0.4 on the foreign subnet <b>88</b>. The FA <b>86</b> advertises a route to the foreign subnet <b>88</b> with network access prefix length of 12.0.0.Y/24. Thus, FA <b>86</b> will accept data packets that have a network address of 12.0.0.Y/24 on the foreign subnet <b>88</b>. For example, the FA <b>86</b> will accept data packets for the non-mobile network devices <b>90</b> and <b>92</b> having a network address of 12.0.0.1. and 12.0.0.2., respectively.</p>
    <p>The mobile node <b>78</b> uses its home network address of 11.0.0.4 on the home subnet <b>80</b> to register with the FA <b>86</b> and the HA <b>76</b>. After registration of the mobile node <b>78</b>, the FA <b>86</b> will also accept data packets for the mobile node <b>78</b> at the specific home network address 11.0.0.4 as well as data packets that have a network prefix of 12.0.0/24. Third Generation Mobile Architecture</p>
    <p>Third-generation (“3G”) architecture, supports data rates ranging from about 114K bits-per-second to about 2M bits-per-second, (“bps”) packet switched services. As noted above, 3G networks encompass a range of wireless technologies including Code Division Multiple Access (“CDMA”), Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service (“UMTS”) Wide-band CDMA (“WCDMA”), and others.</p>
    <p>The ITU-T guidelines for 3G networks are included in the IMT-2000 standard. The ITU-T IMT-2000 standard is incorporated herein by reference. See also, the TIA TSB<b>115</b>, Wireless IP Network Architecture standard, TIA IS-835, Wireless IP Network Standard, and IS2000 and IS2001 standards for CDMA2000, the contents of all of which are incorporated by reference.</p>
    <p>3G networks implementing IS2000 and IS2001 allow mobile nodes to roam from network-to-network using Mobile IP. Many of these mobile nodes may be wireless phones, wireless PDAs, or similar devices that need to establish, maintain, and terminate call or communication sessions. Call control protocols, such as SIP or H.323, may be used for session control. These call control protocols may allow a local proxy to be used on foreign networks so that local policy and/or bandwidth management can be applied to local and remote sessions. In the current generation of 3G networks, a local proxy is typically used on all foreign networks. A local proxy may be included in the FA <b>86</b> or in a stand-alone local proxy server or application program on the foreign network <b>88</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary 3G system <b>108</b>. The exemplary 3G system <b>108</b> includes a foreign gateway network <b>110</b>, a foreign services network <b>112</b>, a foreign DNS application <b>114</b>, a foreign SIP application <b>116</b> and a foreign AAA application <b>118</b>. The exemplary 3G system <b>108</b> also includes a home DNS application <b>120</b>, a home SIP application <b>122</b>, a home AAA application <b>124</b>, a tunnel server (“TS”) <b>126</b> and a correspondence node (“CN”) <b>128</b>. Other embodiments having more, fewer or other components may also be used in 3G system <b>108</b>.</p>
    <p>The home DNS application <b>120</b>, home SIP application <b>122</b>, home AAA application <b>124</b>, tunnel server <b>126</b> and correspondence node <b>128</b> are illustrated as separate components. In other embodiments, all or selected ones of these components may be combined into a single or smaller number of components. For example, some of the other components may be integrated into HA <b>76</b>.</p>
    <p>The foreign gateway network <b>110</b> and foreign services network <b>112</b> are illustrated as separate from foreign network <b>88</b>. The foreign gateway network <b>110</b> may include an IP <b>48</b> network or other network, the foreign services network <b>112</b> may include (i) an IP <b>48</b> network, (ii) a Public Switched Telephone Network (“PSTN”), (iii) a packet data serving node (“PDSN”), and/or (iii) other network or network device. In one embodiment, the FA <b>86</b> is associated with a PDSN. Other types of foreign agents may be used. Further, the foreign gateway network <b>110</b> and the foreign services network <b>112</b> may all be integral to foreign network <b>88</b>.</p>
    <p>In an exemplary embodiment, the foreign gateway network <b>110</b> and the foreign services network <b>112</b> may be integral to foreign network <b>88</b>. Alternatively, the foreign network <b>88</b>, foreign gateway network <b>110</b> and foreign services network <b>112</b> are separate networks, as shown. For simplicity, the separate foreign networks are collectively referred to as “foreign network <b>88</b>.”</p>
    <p>Generally, a PDSN is a required component in most, but not all 3G networks <b>108</b>. For mobile node <b>78</b>, a PDSN is the point of entry into the wireless packet data network. The PDSN performs two basic functions: (1) it exchanges packets with mobile node <b>78</b> over a wireless network; and (2) it exchanges packets with other IP <b>48</b> networks. The PDSN uses associated AAA servers for user authentication and traffic management. Further, the PDSN forwards traffic to a gateway router/home agent (GR/HA) at the designated IP network. Other network access devices or servers may carry out the functionality of a PDSN, as well.</p>
    <p>The PDSN may be coupled with a Packet Control Function (“PCF”). The PCF separates multiple IP <b>48</b> data transmissions and connects them to a core IP infrastructure <b>82</b>. A PCF allows mobile VoIP and IP multimedia calls to continue through the core IP network <b>82</b>.</p>
    <p>The exemplary 3G system <b>108</b> also includes a virtual tunnel <b>130</b>, a default communications path <b>132</b> a new communications path <b>134</b>, and a tunnel server communications path <b>136</b>. The default communications path <b>132</b> includes a communications path from the foreign services applications <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> on a foreign network to the HA <b>76</b> on the home network <b>80</b> to the FA <b>86</b> on the foreign network <b>88</b>, and on to the mobile node <b>78</b> on the foreign network <b>88</b>. The new communications path <b>134</b> includes a communications path from the foreign services applications <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> to the tunnel server <b>126</b> on a foreign network to the FA <b>86</b>, and on to the mobile node <b>78</b> on the foreign network <b>88</b>. The tunnel-server-communications path <b>136</b> includes a communications path or a reverse communications between the foreign service applications <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> and the tunnel server <b>126</b>.</p>
    <p>Also illustrated in FIG. 4 is HA <b>76</b>, mobile node <b>78</b>, home network <b>80</b>, external network <b>82</b>, FA <b>86</b> and foreign network <b>88</b> as described above (see FIG. <b>3</b>). The home network <b>80</b> and the foreign network <b>88</b> may be a wireless network, a LAN, an optical network, a cable network, and/or other equivalent high-speed computer network.</p>
    <p>FIG. 4 illustrates only one FA <b>86</b>. In most implementations, however, plural FAs are used since large numbers of mobile nodes are supported. Further, the exemplary 3G systems may contain more, fewer or equivalent components.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, the exemplary 3G system <b>108</b> includes an all IP <b>48</b> network comprising of an IP <b>48</b> radio access network (“IP-RAN”), a PDSN, a PCF and an IP Mobility Core Network <b>82</b>. Other embodiments with more or fewer components may also be used. These exemplary networks may support 2G, 2.5G and 3G wireless interface technologies including Code Division Multiple Access 95 and 2000 (“CDMA95” and “CDMA2000”), Global System for Mobile Communications, (“GSM”), Generic Packet Radio Services (“GPRS”), Personal Communications Services (“PCS”), a Cellular Digital Packet Data (“CDPD”), Wireless Application Protocol (“WAP”), Digital Audio Broadcasting (“DAB”), Bluetooth, 802.11a, Wireless LAN, Wifi/802.1b, or other types of wireless network interfaces. These multigenerational wireless interface technologies support telephony, Short Message Services (“SMS”), paging, voice mail, call forwarding, faxing, caller ID, Internet access, and e-mail, to name a few of the services available.</p>
    <heading>4. Mobile Node Communication in a Data Network</heading> <p>FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary portion <b>150</b> of the data network <b>108</b>, which provides support for communication between wireless mobile node <b>78</b> and the data network <b>108</b>. The portion includes the wireless mobile node <b>78</b>, a first radio access network (“RANI”) <b>151</b>, a first-network-access device <b>152</b>, a first gateway <b>153</b>, a second radio access network (“RAN<b>2</b>”) <b>154</b>, a second-network-acess device <b>155</b>, a second gateway <b>156</b>, a home network <b>157</b>, and a broker network <b>158</b>.</p>
    <p>Although FIG. 5 shows only two RANs, i.e., RANI <b>151</b> and RAN<b>2</b> <b>154</b>, the portion <b>150</b> of the data network <b>108</b> typically includes a large number of RANs. Moreover, although FIG. 5 shows only two network-access devices, i.e., first-network-access device <b>152</b>, and second-network-access device <b>155</b>, more, or less network-network-access devices may be included in portion <b>150</b>.</p>
    <p>The wireless mobile node <b>78</b> is communicatively coupled with the RANI <b>151</b> via an air interface. Communications transmitted across the air interface conform to an air interface protocol of the wireless communication format. The RANI <b>151</b> in turn may be communicatively coupled to the first-access-control device <b>152</b>. Communications transmitted across the interface connecting the RAN <b>151</b> and first-network-access device <b>152</b> may be transmitted according a protocol, such as IS-2001 A10/A11 or other wireless communication formats.</p>
    <p>RAN <b>151</b> may also provide packet data signaling. This packet data signaling may separated from the data using two logical channels, such as an A10 channel for data and A11 channel for signaling. The A11 signaling may be based on Mobile IP messages or other signaling system messages. Data from the wireless mobile node <b>78</b> may be encapsulated in GRE packets and tunneled to the first-network-access device over the A10 channel, where it is un-encapsulated and processed further.</p>
    <p>The first-network-access device <b>152</b> is in communication with the first gateway <b>153</b> via a first Pi interface <b>159</b>. Similarly, second-network-access device <b>155</b> is in communication with the second gateway <b>156</b> via a second Pi interface <b>160</b>. Communications transmitted over the first Pi interface <b>159</b> and the second Pi interface <b>160</b> may be transmitted according to IP. Data sent over these Pi interfaces may be transmitted as UDP over Mobile IP; however, other transmission protocols may be used. The first gateway <b>153</b> is in communication with the packet data network (PDN) <b>193</b>. Communications exchanged between the first gateway <b>153</b> and PDN <b>193</b> may use IP <b>48</b> or another transport protocol.</p>
    <p>The wireless mobile node <b>78</b> may establish a PPP <b>45</b> session that terminates at the first-network-access device <b>152</b>. This data link is used to help provide a “keep-alive” point-to-point-data link for higher-level application services <b>62</b>.</p>
    <p>PDN <b>193</b> is in communication with the home network <b>157</b>. Similar to the Pi interfaces <b>159</b> and <b>160</b>, communications exchanged between the PDN <b>193</b> and the home network <b>157</b> may use IP, and/or other transmission protocols.</p>
    <p>The home network <b>157</b> may contain a home-network-access-control device (H-NACD) <b>162</b>. The H-NACD <b>162</b> may comprise one or more network-access servers that communicate according to the RADIUS protocol or the DIAMETER protocol. The H-NACD <b>162</b>, however, may use other protocols.</p>
    <p>The first-network-access device <b>152</b> is in communication with the H-NACD <b>162</b> via the first gateway <b>153</b> and the PDN <b>193</b>. The H-NACD <b>162</b> may maintain wireless mobile node <b>78</b> packet-data-provisioning information. This packet-data provisioning information may be stored in a user-profile record (hereinafter referred to as “user profile”) in a data store that is accessible to the H-NACD <b>162</b>. Further, the H-NACD <b>162</b> may be used to authenticate and determine the parameters of a wireless mobile node's <b>78</b> packet-data session.</p>
    <p>Broker network <b>158</b> is also in communication with the PDN <b>193</b>. Communications exchanged between the PDN <b>193</b> and broker network <b>158</b> may use IP, and/or other transmission protocols.</p>
    <p>Broker network <b>158</b> may contain a broker-network-access-control device (B-NACD) <b>157</b>. The B-NACD <b>157</b> may comprise one or more network-access servers that communicate according to the RADIUS protocol or the DIAMETER protocol. The B-NACD <b>157</b>, however, may use other protocols. Similar to the H-NACD <b>162</b>, the B-NACD <b>157</b> may have access to and/or maintain a copy of wireless mobile node <b>78</b> packet-data-provisioning information that is extracted from the user profile.</p>
    <p>The first-network-access control device <b>152</b> is in communication with second-network-access device <b>155</b>. Communications passed between first-network-access control device <b>152</b> and the second-network-access device <b>153</b> may be sent and received according to an inter-network-access-device protocol. Communications over this link may be passed according to other transmission protocols as well.</p>
    <heading>5. Support for Prepaid Billing for Wireless Mobile Nodes on a Data Network</heading> <p>FIG. 6 is a flow diagram illustrating a method <b>200</b> for providing hand-offs for wireless prepaid services on network portion <b>150</b> of data network <b>108</b> using prepaid billing in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. In FIG. 6, at step <b>210</b>, the first-network-access device <b>151</b>, requests network access from the H-NACD <b>162</b>, to establish connectivity for a wireless communication session for mobile node <b>98</b> within the coverage area of the first-network-access device <b>151</b>. At step <b>212</b>, the HNACD <b>162</b> receives the request for network access from the first-network-access device <b>151</b>, and in response, determines if the wireless communication session is eligible for wireless prepaid services.</p>
    <p>If eligible, at step <b>214</b>, the H-NACD <b>162</b> sends to the first-network-access device <b>151</b> authorization or other approval for serving wireless prepaid services to the mobile NODE <b>78</b> device for the wireless communication session. In addition, at step <b>216</b>, the H-NACD <b>162</b> sends to the first-network-access device <b>151</b> a first block of credits, withdrawn from a user account having a cache of available credits.</p>
    <p>The size of the first block of credits and any other block of credits sent from the network-access-control device may vary. For example, the block of credits may contain fractional credits, whole credits, or some combination of the factional and whole credits. Moreover, the number of credits may vary from block to block. In one instance, the H-NACD <b>162</b> may send (as the first block of credits) a block of credits containing a plurality of whole credits. In another instance, the H-NACD <b>162</b> may send (as the first block) of credits a block of credits containing only a fraction of a credit.</p>
    <p>The H-NACD <b>162</b> may vary the size of the blocks of credits based on a supply of available credits contained in a cache of available credits. Alternatively, the H-NACD <b>162</b> may vary the size of the blocks of credits based on the type of session activity for the wireless communication session. For example, voice content may use one block size, while non-voice data may use another block size. Other conditions may cause the H-NACD <b>162</b> may vary the size of the blocks of credits as well.</p>
    <p>At step <b>218</b>, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> receives the authorization or other approval for network access for the wireless communication session. And in addition to receiving the authorization or other approval, at step <b>220</b>, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> receives from the H-NACD <b>162</b> the first block of credits</p>
    <p>After receiving authorization for the wireless communication session, the network-access device <b>151</b>, at step <b>222</b>, establishes session activity for the wireless communication session. In an exemplary embodiment, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> is in the path of the wireless communication session. Being in the path of the wireless communication session allows the first-network access device <b>151</b> to directly monitor the usage of the wireless prepaid service used by the wireless communication session. The first-network-access device <b>151</b>, however, need not be in the path of the wireless communication session. In such case, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> indirectly monitors the usage of the wireless communication session. For example, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> may receive the usage of the wireless communication session from another network-access device (e.g., another PDSN).</p>
    <p>At <b>224</b>, the H-NACD <b>162</b> may also send to the first-network-access device <b>151</b> measurement-method parameters in conjunction with first block of credits. At <b>226</b>, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> receives from the H-NACD <b>162</b>, the measurement-method parameters.</p>
    <p>Measurement-method parameters received in conjunction with a block of credits, such as those received with the first block of credits, may only apply to the first block of credits. This type of measurement-method parameters may be referred to as local-measurement-method parameters because they only apply to the corresponding block of credits. The measurement-method parameters, however, may be “global” measurement-method parameters. As global-measurement-method parameters, the parameters may apply to the block they were received with as well as with other blocks.</p>
    <p>In an alternative embodiment, the network-access device may contain its own predetermined-measurement-method parameters. In such case, the network-access control device <b>151</b> might not send the measurement-method parameters. However, despite having the predetermined-measurement-method parameters, the H-NACD <b>162</b> may still send the measurement-method parameters to the first-network-access device <b>151</b>. Doing so, leaves open the option of changing the measurement methods for determining usage of a prepaid wireless communication session.</p>
    <p>The measurement-method parameters passed to the first-network-access device <b>151</b> from the H-NACD <b>162</b> may include an indication for determining which of the plurality of predetermined-measurement methods the first-network-access device <b>151</b> should select for determining the usage units for the wireless communication session. For instance, the measurement-method parameters may include one or more bits, bytes, pointers, algorithms, instructions, and/or other indicators that the network-access device may use for selecting one or more of the plurality of predetermined-measurement methods. Each of the plurality of predetermined-measurement methods may include methods for measuring the session activity of the wireless communication session in terms of time used, time connected, bytes received, bytes transmitted, packets received, packets transmitted, and/or any other measurement method for wireless communication services.</p>
    <p>In another alternative, the measurement-method parameters passed to the first-network-access device <b>151</b> from the H-NACD <b>162</b> may include an algorithm, conversion factor, and/or other instruction for determining the usage units for the wireless communication session. Similar to the plurality of predetermined-measurement methods contained within first-network-access device <b>151</b>, these measurement-method parameters may provide the first-network-access device <b>151</b> with one or more methods for measuring the session activity of the wireless communication session. The methods for measuring the session activity may be in terms of the time used, the time connected, the number of bytes received, the number of bytes transmitted, the number of packets received, the number of packets transmitted, and/or any other measurement method for wireless communication services.</p>
    <p>For example, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> may receive from the H-NACD <b>162</b> as one of the measurement-method parameters an algorithm that applies different usage units to the session activity of the wireless communication session depending on the type of data being passed. By processing the algorithm, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> may use a first type of usage units for a first type of data, a second type of usage unit for a second type of data, and n<sup>th </sup>type usage unit for an n<sup>th </sup>type of data (where n is any integer) for the data being passed in the wireless communication session.</p>
    <p>At step <b>228</b>, the mobile node <b>78</b> roams or otherwise moves into the coverage area of a second-network-access device <b>155</b>, which in turn establishes connectivity with the mobile node <b>78</b>. In response to moving into the coverage area of the second-network access device <b>155</b>, the first-network-access device <b>151</b>, at step <b>230</b>, tunnels the session activity to the second-network-access device <b>155</b>.</p>
    <p>At step <b>232</b>, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> periodically measures the usage of the session activity for the wireless communication session. Periodically measuring usage of the session activity may include the first-network-access device <b>151</b> measuring the usage of the session activity while in the first coverage area in terms of a first of the measurement-method parameters. Alternatively, periodically measuring the usage of the session activity may include the first-network-access device <b>151</b> measuring the usage of the session activity tunneled to the second-network-access device <b>155</b> in terms of a second of the measurement-method parameters.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, the first of the measurement-method parameters and the second of the measurement-method parameters are the same. These measurement-method parameters, however, may vary. For instance, the second-network-access device might not belong to the home network <b>157</b> of the mobile node <b>78</b>. In such case, second-network-access device <b>155</b> may be part of the broker network <b>158</b>. In this broker network <b>158</b>, the broker network policies may determine which of the measurement-method parameters to use for the session activity. These measurement-method parameters may be multiples of the measurement-method parameters used for the session activity in the first coverage area. For instance, the measurement-method parameters for the session activity on the broker network <b>158</b> may be used to measure usage at twice the rate of the session activity in the first coverage area. This scalability allows for continued connectivity of the session activity when the mobile node <b>78</b> roams into areas not covered by the mobile node's <b>78</b> home network.</p>
    <p>At step <b>234</b>, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> debits the usage of the session activity for the wireless communication from the first block of credits. The first-network-access <b>151</b> device may debit the usage of the session activity from the first block of credits for the session activity occurring in the first coverage area and for the session activity that the first-network-access device tunnels to the second-network-access device <b>155</b>.</p>
    <p>The foregoing steps illustrate method <b>200</b> with an exemplary embodiment. The method <b>200</b>, however, is not limited to these steps. Other embodiments with other steps can be used to practice method <b>200</b>, as well.</p>
    <p>FIG. 7 is a flow diagram illustrating the method <b>200</b> for providing hand-offs for wireless prepaid services on network portion <b>150</b> of data network <b>108</b> using prepaid billing in accordance with another exemplary embodiment. In addition to the steps illustrated in FIG. 6, FIG. 7 illustrates other steps for carrying out method <b>200</b>.</p>
    <p>At step <b>250</b>, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> sends to the H-NACD <b>162</b> a request for an additional block of credits. The first-network-access device <b>151</b> may make the request at a predetermined threshold, for example, when a predetermined number of the credits remain in the block of credits. The first-network-access device <b>151</b> may make the request for additional credits proactively. That is, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> may make the request at any time before depletion of the block of credits. Alternatively, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> may make the request for additional credits when the no credits remain in the block. In another alternative, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> may make the request for additional credits based on an algorithm that insures that as long as available credits remain, it will receive additional blocks of credits. Other algorithms are possible, as well.</p>
    <p>The H-NACD <b>162</b>, at step <b>252</b>, receives from the first-network-access device <b>151</b> the request for the second or additional block of credits. At step <b>254</b>, the H-NACD <b>162</b> determines if enough credits remain in the cache of available credits to withdraw the requested additional block of credits. If available credits remain, at step <b>256</b>, the H-NACD <b>162</b> fulfills the request by sending to the first-network-access device the additional block of credits.</p>
    <p>At step <b>258</b>, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> receives from the H-NACD <b>162</b> the additional block of credits. At step <b>260</b>, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> debits the usage of the session activity for the wireless communication session from the additional block of credits. In an exemplary embodiment, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> is in the path of the wireless communication session. Because the network-access device <b>151</b> may be in the path of the wireless communication session, it may directly measure the usage of the wireless prepaid service used by the wireless communication session.</p>
    <p>At step <b>262</b>, H-NACD <b>162</b> may also send to the first-network-access device <b>151</b> one or more measurement-method parameters. These measurement-method parameters may vary from the measurement-method parameters sent to the first-network-access device <b>151</b> in conjunction with the first block of credits. In an exemplary embodiment, the measurement-method parameters are local-measurement-method parameters. Alternatively, the measurement-method parameters sent to the first-network-access device may be global-measurement-method parameters.</p>
    <p>Step <b>262</b> may be omitted if, for example, the H-NACD <b>162</b> sent to the first-network-access device <b>151</b> the global-measurement-method parameters in conjunction with the sending the first block of credits, and the measurement-method parameters for the additional block of credits are also global-measurement-method parameters. In yet another alternative, step <b>262</b> may be omitted if, for example, the first-network-access-device <b>151</b> contains a plurality of its predetermined-measurement methods, and the H-NACD <b>162</b> has already selected one of a plurality of its predetermined-measurement methods for determining usage units for the wireless communication session. Step <b>262</b> may be omitted for various other reasons as well.</p>
    <p>At step <b>264</b>, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> may receive from the H-NACD <b>162</b> the measurement-method parameters. As noted above, the measurement-method parameters may be either local-measurement-method parameters or global-measurement-method parameters. Depending on the type of measurement-method parameters received, the method by which the network-access device determines the usage units for the session activity may vary.</p>
    <p>In the local-measurement-method parameter case, the measurement-method parameters may differ from the measurement-method parameters received by the first-network-access device <b>151</b> in conjunction with receiving the first block of credits. The difference between the measurement-method parameters received in step <b>226</b> (FIG. 6) and those received in step <b>264</b> may include different algorithms, conversion factors, and/or other instructions for determining the usage units for the wireless communication session.</p>
    <p>The measurement-method parameters, however, may include one or more identical or similar algorithms, conversion factors, and/or other instructions for determining the usage units for the wireless communication session. These measurement-method parameters may provide methods for measuring the session activity of the wireless communication session in terms of the time used, the time connected, the number of bytes received, the number of bytes transmitted, the number of packets received, the number of packets transmitted, and/or any other measurement method for wireless communication services.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, at block <b>266</b>, in response to receiving one or more measurement-method parameters, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> may select one of a plurality of its predetermined-measurement methods for determining usage units for the wireless communication session. Paralleling step <b>226</b>, the measurement-method parameters passed to the first-network-access device <b>151</b> from the H-NACD <b>162</b> may include an indication for determining which of the plurality of predetermined-measurement methods that the first-network-access device <b>151</b> should select for determining the usage units for the wireless communication session. These indications may include one or more bits, bytes, pointers, algorithms, instructions, and/or other indicators that the first-network-access device <b>151</b> may use in selecting a particular (e.g., the first) predetermined-measurement methods.</p>
    <p>The global-measurement-method parameter case is similar to the local-measurement-method parameter case except that the measurement-method parameters passed to the first-network-access device <b>151</b> from H-NACD <b>162</b> in conjunction with the additional block of credits do not differ from those passed in conjunction with the first block of credits. Step <b>266</b> might be omitted if the measurement-method parameters are global-measurement-method parameters.</p>
    <p>At step <b>268</b>, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> periodically measures usage of the session activity. This may include the measuring the usage of the session activity while in the first coverage area in terms of a first of the measurement-method parameters and measuring the usage of the session activity tunneled to the second-network-access device <b>155</b> in terms of a second of the measurement-method parameters. In one embodiment, the first of the measurement-method parameters and the second of the measurement-method parameters may be the same. These measurement-method parameters, however, may vary.</p>
    <p>The foregoing steps illustrate method <b>200</b> with an exemplary embodiment. The method <b>200</b>, however, is not limited to these steps. Other embodiments with other steps can be used to practice method <b>200</b>, as well.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 8<i>a</i>, <b>8</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>8</b> <i>c </i>are flow diagrams illustrating a method <b>300</b> for providing hand-offs for wireless prepaid services on network portion <b>150</b> data network <b>108</b> using prepaid billing in accordance with another exemplary embodiment. FIGS. 8<i>a</i>, <b>8</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>8</b> <i>c </i>show exemplary method <b>300</b>, which is similar to exemplary method <b>200</b>, except as described herein.</p>
    <p>In FIG. 8<i>a</i>, at step <b>302</b>, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> engages in session activity for a wireless communication session with the mobile node <b>78</b> within the first coverage area. At some point, (e.g., during registration with the H-NACD <b>162</b>) the first-network-access device <b>151</b> receives from the H-NACD <b>162</b> a first block of credits, as illustrated in step <b>304</b>. At step <b>306</b>, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> may thereafter periodically measures usage of the session activity. In turn, at step <b>308</b>, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> debits the usage of the session activity from the first block of credits.</p>
    <p>At step <b>310</b>, the second-network-access device <b>155</b>, requests from the H-NACD <b>162</b> network access or registration for the session activity of the wireless communication session after the mobile node <b>78</b> moves into a second coverage area. The request for network access may be made during a state transition of the session activity of the wireless communication session. For example, the request may be made when the session activity goes from active to dormant state, from an active to inactive state, or any other state transition. Alternatively, the request for network access may be made at any time.</p>
    <p>At step <b>312</b>, the H-NACD <b>162</b> receives the request for network access from the second-network-access device <b>155</b>, and in response, determines if the wireless communication session is eligible for wireless prepaid services. The H-NACD <b>162</b> may determine whether the session activity is a new communication or whether the request for network access is a hand-off of the ongoing session activity originally carried by the first-network-access device <b>151</b>.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, the second-network-access device <b>151</b> may send to the H-NACD <b>162</b> information indicative of the session activity. This information may contain indications that inform the H-NACD <b>162</b> that the session activity is either session activity for a new communication or the session activity that is handed-off. Details for an exemplary hand-off mechanism for informing the H-NACD <b>162</b> are provided by the commonly assigned, and co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 10/097796, filed on Mar. 14, 2002, and titled “Method and System for Re-Direction and Hand-off for Pre-Paid Mobile Services in Third Generation Networks.”</p>
    <p>If eligible, at step <b>314</b>, the H-NACD <b>162</b> sends to the second-network-access device <b>155</b> authorization or other approval for serving wireless prepaid services to the wireless mobile device for the wireless communication session. In addition, at step <b>316</b>, the H-NACD <b>162</b> sends to the second-network-access device <b>155</b> a second block of credits.</p>
    <p>At step <b>318</b>, the H-NACD <b>162</b> may also send to the second-network-access device <b>155</b> measurement-method parameters in conjunction with second block of credits. These measurement-method parameters may be local-measurement-method parameters or may be global-measurement-method parameters.</p>
    <p>At step <b>320</b>, the second-network-access device <b>155</b> receives the authorization or other approval for network access for the handed-off session activity. And in addition to receiving the authorization or other approval, at step <b>322</b>, the second-network-access device <b>155</b> receives from the H-NACD <b>162</b> the second block of credits.</p>
    <p>In an alternative embodiment, the second-network-access device <b>155</b> may contain its own predetermined-measurement-method parameters. In such case, the second-network-access control device <b>155</b> might not send the measurement-method parameters. However, despite the second-network-access device <b>155</b> having the predetermined-measurement-method parameters, the H-NACD <b>162</b> may still send the measurement-method parameters.</p>
    <p>The measurement-method parameters passed to the second-network-access device <b>155</b> from H-NACD <b>162</b> may include an indication for determining which of the plurality of predetermined-measurement methods the second-network-access device <b>155</b> should select for determining the usage units for the wireless communication session. In one exemplary embodiment, the measurement-method parameters may include one or more bits, bytes, pointers, algorithms, instructions, and/or other indicators that the second-network-access device may use for selecting one of the plurality predetermined-measurement methods.</p>
    <p>Each of the plurality of predetermined-measurement methods may include methods for measuring the session activity of the wireless communication session in terms of time used, time connected, bytes received, bytes transmitted, packets received, packets transmitted, and/or any other measurement method for wireless communication services.</p>
    <p>In another alternative, the measurement-method parameters passed to the second-network-access device <b>155</b> may include an algorithm, conversion factor, and/or other instruction for determining the usage units for the wireless communication session. Similar to the plurality of predetermined-measurement methods contained within first-network-access device, these measurement-method parameters may provide the second-network-access device <b>155</b> with one or more methods for measuring the session activity of the wireless communication session. These methods may be in terms of the time used, the time connected, the number of bytes received, the number of bytes transmitted, the number of packets received, the number of packets transmitted, and/or any other measurement method for wireless communication services.</p>
    <p>After receiving the authorization for network access for the handed-off session activity, the second-network-access device <b>155</b>, at step <b>324</b>, establishes session activity for the wireless communication session. Thereafter, while the session activity is ongoing on the second-network access device <b>155</b>, at step <b>326</b>, the second-network-access device periodically measures the usage of the handed-off session activity. Periodically measuring the usage of the handed-off session activity may include the second-network-access device <b>155</b> measuring the usage in terms of one or more of the measurement-method parameters.</p>
    <p>The second-network-access device <b>155</b> may use different measurement-method parameters than those used or received by the first-network-access device <b>151</b> before the session activity is handed-off. The second-network-access device <b>155</b>, however, may use the same measurement-method parameters. As noted above, the second-network-access device <b>155</b> might not belong to the home network <b>157</b> of the wireless mobile node. In such case, the second-network-access device <b>155</b> can be part of a broker network <b>158</b>. The broker network policies may determine which of the measurement-method parameters to use for the handed-off session activity. These measurement-method parameters may be multiples of the measurement-method parameters used for the session activity in the first coverage area. At step <b>328</b>, the second-network-access device <b>155</b> debits the usage of the session activity from the second block of credits.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 8<i>b</i>, at some time after the second-network-access device <b>155</b> establishes the session activity for the wireless communication session, the H-NACD <b>162</b>, at <b>330</b>, sends to the first-network-access device <b>151</b> a first indication that will causes the first-network-access device <b>151</b> to stop debiting the usage of the session activity. At <b>332</b>, the first-network-access device <b>155</b> receives from the H-NACD <b>162</b> the first indication. In response, at <b>334</b>, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> stops debiting the usage of the session activity from the first block of credits. This first indication may include a stop accounting message, a terminate session activity message, a disconnect message or another type of message.</p>
    <p>In addition to the sending to the first-network-access device <b>151</b> the first indication, after the second-network-access device <b>155</b> establishes the session activity, H-NACD <b>162</b>, at step <b>336</b>, sends to the first-network-access device <b>151</b> a second indication that causes the first-network-access device <b>151</b> to return any remaining credits to the H-NACD <b>162</b>. The first-network-access device <b>151</b>, at step <b>338</b>, receives this second indication, and at step <b>340</b>, returns any remaining credits to the H-NACD <b>162</b>. This second indication may include a stop accounting message, a terminate session activity message, a disconnect message or another type of message.</p>
    <p>In another alternative, at step <b>342</b>, after the second-network-access device <b>155</b> establishes the session activity for the wireless communication session, the H-NACD <b>162</b> sends to the first-network-access device <b>151</b> a third indication that causes the first-network-access device <b>151</b> to transfer any remaining credits to the second-network-access device <b>155</b> or other network-access device. At step <b>344</b>, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> receives from the H-NACD <b>162</b> this second indication. At step <b>346</b>, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> transfers any remaining credits to the second-network-access device <b>155</b> or other network-access device. The second-network-access device <b>155</b> or other network-access device may debit the usage of session activity of the wireless communication session or other eligible wireless communication session from these transferred credits.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 8<i>c</i>, in yet another alternative, the first-network-access device <b>151</b>, at step <b>348</b>, requests an additional block of credits after the second-network-access device <b>155</b> establishes the session activity for the wireless communication session. The first-network-access device <b>151</b> may make the request after transferring the remaining credits to the second-network-access device <b>155</b>. Alternatively, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> may make the request at a predetermined threshold.</p>
    <p>At step <b>350</b>, in response to receiving the request for additional block of credits, the H-NACD <b>162</b> sends to the first-network-access device <b>151</b> an indication that will cause the first-network-access device <b>151</b> to stop debiting the usage of the session activity from the first block of credits. The first-network-access device <b>151</b>, at step <b>352</b>, receives from the H-NACD <b>162</b> this indication. Responsive to receiving the indication, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> stops debiting the usage of the session activity from the first block of credits. At step <b>354</b>, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> returns any unused credits to the H-NACD <b>162</b>.</p>
    <p>In another alternative, at step <b>358</b>, in response to receiving the request for additional block of credits, the H-NACD <b>162</b> does not send a response to the request. At step <b>360</b>, upon not receiving a responsive, the session activity on the first-network-access device <b>151</b> terminates when the remaining credits expire. In another alternative, upon not receiving a response to the request for additional credits, the first-network-access device, <b>151</b> at step <b>362</b> may stop debiting the usage of the session activity from the first block of credits. And at step <b>364</b>, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> (i) may return any remaining credits to the network-access-control device, (ii) may send any remaining credits to the second-network-access device <b>155</b>, and/or (iii) may send to the another network-access device any remaining credits.</p>
    <p>The foregoing steps illustrate method <b>300</b> with an exemplary embodiment. The method <b>300</b>, however, is not limited to these steps. For instance, while carrying on and before handing-off the session activity, the first-network-access device may (i) request and receive additional blocks of credits, (ii) receive additional measurement-method parameters, (iii) measure the session activity, (iv) debit usage of the session activity against the additional blocks of credits, and/or (v) purchase additional credits. Other embodiments with other steps can be used to practice method <b>300</b>, as well.</p>
    <p>Referring back to FIG. 7, at step <b>250</b>, the second-network-access device <b>155</b> may request from the H-NACD <b>162</b> an additional block of credits after hand-off the session activity. The second-network-access device may make the request at a predetermined threshold. Further, the second-network-access device <b>155</b> may make the request (i) proactively, i.e., at any time before depletion of the block of credits; (ii) when the no credits remain in the block; (iii) based on an algorithm that insures that as long as available credits remain, the second-network-access device will receive additional blocks of credits; and/or (iv) based on other algorithms.</p>
    <p>The H-NACD <b>162</b>, at step <b>252</b>, receives from the second-network-access device <b>155</b> the request for the second or additional block of credits. At step <b>254</b>, the H-NACD <b>162</b> determines if enough credits remain in the cache of available credits to withdraw the requested additional block of credits. If available credits remain, at step <b>256</b>, the H-NACD <b>162</b> fulfills the request by sending to the second-network-access device <b>155</b> the additional block of credits.</p>
    <p>At step <b>258</b>, the second-network-access device <b>155</b> receives the additional block of credits. At step <b>260</b>, the second-network-access device <b>155</b> debits the usage of the session activity for the wireless communication session from the additional block of credits.</p>
    <p>At step <b>262</b>, the H-NACD <b>162</b> may also send to the second-network-access device <b>155</b> one or more measurement-method parameters. These measurement-method parameters may vary from the measurement-method parameters sent to the first-network-access device <b>151</b> in conjunction with the first block of credits, and those sent to the second-network-access device in conjunction with the second block of credits. The measurement-method parameters may be local-measurement-method parameters or may be global-measurement-method parameters.</p>
    <p>At step <b>264</b>, the second-network-access device <b>155</b> may receive from the H-NACD <b>162</b> the measurement-method parameters. These measurement-method parameters may include one or more algorithms, conversion factors, and/or other instructions for determining the usage units for the wireless communication session. These measurement-method parameters may provide methods for measuring the session activity of the wireless communication session in terms of the time used, the time connected, the number of bytes received, the number of bytes transmitted, the number of packets received, the number of packets transmitted, and/or any other measurement method for wireless communication services.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, at step <b>266</b>, in response to receiving one or more measurement-method parameters, the second-network-access device <b>155</b> may select one of a plurality of its predetermined-measurement methods for determining usage units for the wireless communication session. Paralleling step <b>226</b> (FIG. <b>6</b>), the measurement-method parameters passed to the second-network-access device <b>155</b> from the H-NACD <b>162</b> may include an indication for determining which of the plurality of predetermined-measurement methods that the second-network-access device <b>155</b> should select for determining the usage units for the wireless communication session.</p>
    <p>At step <b>268</b>, the second-network-access device <b>155</b> periodically measures usage of the session activity. This may include measuring the usage of the session activity in terms of a third of the measurement-method parameters. The third of the measurement-method parameters may be, but need not be, different from those received in conjunction with the first-block of credits or the second block of credits.</p>
    <p>The foregoing steps illustrate method <b>300</b> with an exemplary embodiment. The method <b>300</b>, however, is not limited to these steps. Other embodiments with other steps can be used to practice method <b>300</b>, as well.</p>
    <p>FIG. 9 is a flow diagram illustrating a method <b>400</b> for providing hand-offs for wireless prepaid services on a data network using prepaid billing in accordance with another exemplary embodiment. FIG. 9 shows exemplary method <b>400</b>, which is similar to exemplary method <b>300</b>, except as described herein.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 9, at step <b>402</b>, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> engages in session activity of a wireless communication session with mobile node <b>78</b> within a first coverage area. At step <b>404</b>, after granting network access for the session activity, a H-NACD <b>162</b> sends to the first-network-access device <b>151</b> a first block of credits. At step, <b>406</b>, first-network-access device <b>151</b> receives from the H-NACD <b>162</b> the first block of credits. The first-network-access device <b>151</b> periodically measures usage of the session activity at step <b>408</b>. The first-network-access device <b>151</b> then debits the usage of the session activity from the first block of credits at step <b>410</b>.</p>
    <p>At some point, the mobile node <b>78</b> roams or moves into a second coverage area, and at step <b>412</b>, the second-network-access device <b>155</b> establishes connectivity with the mobile node <b>78</b>. In response to roaming into the coverage area of the second-network access device <b>155</b>, at step <b>414</b>, the first-network-access device <b>155</b> tunnels the session activity and unused credits to the second-network-access device <b>155</b>. Then, the second-network-access device <b>155</b> debits the usage of the tunneled session activity from the tunneled unused credits at step <b>416</b>.</p>
    <p>Sometime after the mobile node <b>78</b> roams in the second coverage area, the second-network-access device <b>155</b>, at step <b>418</b>, requests from the H-NACD <b>162</b> network access for the session activity. The second-network-access device <b>155</b> may make the request for network access after a state transition in the session activity, such as when the session activity goes from active to dormant state, from an active to inactive state, or any other state transition. The request for network access, however, may be made at any time</p>
    <p>At step <b>420</b>, the H-NACD <b>162</b> receives the request for network access from the second-network-access device <b>155</b>, and in response, determines if the wireless communication session is eligible for wireless prepaid services. The <b>162</b> may determine whether the session activity is a new communication or whether the network access is a hand-off of the ongoing session activity originally carried by the first-network-access device <b>151</b>.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, the second-network-access device <b>155</b> may send to the H-NACD <b>162</b> information indicative of the session activity in addition to the request for network access. This information may contain indications that inform the H-NACD <b>162</b> that the session activity is either session activity for a new communication or the session activity that is handed-off.</p>
    <p>After determining that the wireless communication session is eligible for wireless prepaid services, at step <b>422</b>, the H-NACD <b>162</b> sends to the second-network-access-control device <b>155</b> a second block of credits. At step <b>424</b>, the second-network-access device <b>155</b> receives the second block of credits.</p>
    <p>At step <b>426</b>, the H-NACD <b>162</b> may also send to the second-network-access device <b>155</b> one or more measurement-method parameters. These measurement-method parameters may vary from the measurement-method parameters sent to the first-network-access device <b>151</b> in conjunction with the first block of credits, and may be local-measurement-method parameters or may be global-measurement-method parameters.</p>
    <p>At step <b>428</b>, the second-network-access device <b>155</b> receives the measurement-method parameters. These measurement-method parameters may include one or more algorithms, conversion factors, and/or other instructions for determining the usage units for the wireless communication session. The measurement-method parameters may provide methods for measuring the session activity of the wireless communication session in terms of the time used, the time connected, the number of bytes received, the number of bytes transmitted, the number of packets received, the number of packets transmitted, and/or any other measurement method for wireless communication services.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, in response to receiving one or more measurement-method parameters, the second-network-access device <b>155</b> may select one of a plurality of its predetermined-measurement methods for determining usage units for the wireless communication session. Paralleling step <b>226</b> (FIG. <b>6</b>), the measurement-method parameters passed to the second-network-access device <b>155</b> may include an indication for determining which of the plurality of predetermined-measurement methods that the second-network-access device <b>155</b> should select for determining the usage units for the wireless communication session. These indications may include one or more bits, bytes, pointers, algorithms, instructions, and/or other indicators that the network-access device may use in selecting a particular predetermined-measurement methods.</p>
    <p>At step <b>430</b>, the second-network-access device <b>155</b> provides independent network access for the session activity. At step <b>430</b>, the second-network-access device <b>155</b> periodically measures usage of the session activity. This may include measuring the usage of the handed-off session activity in terms of a third of the measurement-method parameters. These measurement-method parameters may be, but need not be, different from those received in conjunction with the first-block of credits. At step <b>434</b>, the second-network-access device <b>155</b> debits the usage of the handed-off session activity from the second block of credits.</p>
    <p>After the second-network-access device <b>155</b> establishes independent network access, the H-NACD <b>162</b>, at step <b>436</b>, may send to the first-network-access device <b>151</b> an indication that it to stop debiting the usage of the session activity from the first block of credits, if any credits remain. The H-NACD <b>162</b> may send the indication in response to determining that the session activity now carried by the second-network-access device <b>155</b> results from a hand-off. At step <b>438</b>, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> receives from the H-NACD <b>162</b> the first indication, and stops debiting the usage of the session activity from the first block of credits. This indication may be a stop accounting message, a terminate session activity message, a disconnect message or another type of message. In addition to the sending to the first-network-access device <b>151</b> the first indication and after the second-network-access device <b>155</b> establishes the session activity, the H-NACD <b>162</b>, at step <b>440</b>, sends to the first-network-access device <b>151</b> a second indication that causes the it to return any remaining credits. The first-network-access device <b>151</b>, at step <b>442</b>, receives the second indication, and returns any remaining credits to the H-NACD <b>162</b>. This second indication may include a stop accounting message, a terminate session activity message, a disconnect message or another type of message.</p>
    <p>Referring back to FIG. 8<i>c</i>, at step <b>348</b>, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> requests an additional block of credits after the second-network-access device <b>155</b> establishes the session activity for the wireless communication session. The first-network-access device <b>151</b> may make the request after transferring the remaining credit to the second-network-access device. Alternatively, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> may make the request at a predetermined threshold.</p>
    <p>At step <b>350</b>, in response to receiving the request for additional block of credits, the H-NACD <b>162</b> sends to the first-network-access device <b>151</b> an indication that will cause it to stop debiting the usage of the session activity from the first block of credits. The first-network-access device <b>151</b>, at step <b>352</b>, receives this indication. Responsive to receiving the indication, the first-network-access device <b>151</b> stops debiting the usage of the session activity from the first block of credits. At step <b>354</b>, the first-network-access device to returns any remaining credits to the H-NACD <b>162</b>.</p>
    <p>In another alternative, at step <b>358</b>, in response to receiving the request for additional block of credits, the H-NACD <b>162</b> sends no response to the request. At step <b>360</b>, upon not receiving a responsive indication to the request, the session activity on the first-network-access device <b>151</b> terminates when the remaining credits expire. In another alternative, upon not receiving a response to the request for additional credits, the first-network-access device <b>151</b>, at step <b>362</b>, may stop debiting the usage of the session activity from the first block of credits. And at step <b>364</b>, the first-network-access device (i) may return any remaining credits, (ii) may send any remaining credits to the second-network-access device <b>155</b>, and/or (iii) may send to another network-access device any remaining credits.</p>
    <p>The foregoing steps illustrate method <b>400</b> with an exemplary embodiment. The method <b>400</b>, however, is not limited to these steps. Other embodiments with other steps can be used to practice method <b>400</b>, as well.</p>
    <p>Further, the foregoing description indicates carrying out method <b>200</b>, method <b>300</b> and method <b>400</b> for one wireless communications session. The method <b>200</b>, however, may be carried out for multiple, simultaneous wireless communications sessions. Since each wireless communication session is considered a separate communication session, method <b>200</b>, method <b>300</b>, and method <b>400</b> may be carried out for each wireless communication session in the identical or similar manner as described above, but method <b>200</b>, method <b>300</b>, and method <b>400</b> may be carried out in other ways as well. The multiple, simultaneous wireless communication sessions may (i) originate and terminate from the one or more wireless mobile nodes, (ii) connect through the one or more network-access devices, (iii) tunnel from one network-access device to other network-access devices, (iv) be handed-off (e.g., soft, fast or hard hand-off) from one network-access device other access devices, and/or (v) be eligible to receive prepaid wireless services from the same user profile and/or cache of available credits.</p>
    <p>Moreover, it is contemplated that during multiple, simultaneous wireless communication sessions, the network-access-control device may initiate a request to terminate one or more wireless communication sessions so that the portions of the block of credits allotted to such wireless communication sessions may be used by another communication session. The network-access-control device may initiate the request to terminate based on prepaid plan policies, such as communication session importance, or may initiate the request to terminate in response to a user request.</p>
    <heading>6. Mobile Node Communication in A 3G Network</heading> <p>FIG. 10 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary portion <b>170</b> of the 3G network <b>108</b>, which provides support for communication between wireless mobile node <b>78</b> and the 3G network <b>108</b>. The portion <b>170</b> includes a wireless mobile node <b>78</b>, a base station (“BTS”) <b>172</b>, base station controllers (“BSC”) <b>171</b> and <b>173</b>, a PCF <b>174</b>, a radio packet interface (“RPI”) <b>176</b>, a source PSDN <b>178</b>, a source gateway <b>181</b>, a radio access network (“RAN”) <b>183</b>, a foreign PCF/RPI <b>180</b>, a foreign PDSN <b>185</b>, a foreign gateway <b>187</b>, a home network <b>140</b>, and a broker network <b>142</b>.</p>
    <p>Although FIG. 10 shows only two BSCs, i.e., BSCs <b>171</b> and <b>173</b>, the portion <b>170</b> of the 3G system typically includes a large number of BSCs. Further, although FIG. 10 shows only a single BTS, i.e., BTS <b>172</b> coupled to BSC <b>173</b>, each BSC may be connected to a greater or a fewer number of BTSs. Moreover, although FIG. 10 shows only two PDSNs, i.e., PDSN <b>178</b> and PDSN <b>185</b>, more, or less PDSNs may be included in portion <b>170</b>.</p>
    <p>The wireless mobile node <b>78</b> is communicatively coupled with the BTS <b>172</b> over an air interface. Communications transmitted across the air interface conform to the air interface protocol of for the wireless communication format. For instance, in a CDMA circuit voice session, the protocol may be enhanced variable rate vocoder (EVRC) or IS-127. The BTS <b>172</b> in turn may be communicatively coupled to the BSC <b>173</b> and/or BSC <b>171</b>. Communications transmitted across the interface connecting the BTS <b>172</b> and BSC <b>173</b> or BSC <b>171</b> may be transmitted according a protocol such as IS-707 or IS-127. Other protocols are possible as well.</p>
    <p>BSCs <b>171</b> and <b>173</b> are also in communication with PCF <b>174</b>. Communications transmitted between BSCs <b>171</b> and <b>173</b> may be transmitted according to a protocol, such as IS-2001A3/A7 or another wireless communication format. The RPI <b>176</b>, which is used for packet data signaling, provides a link between PCF <b>174</b> and PDSN <b>178</b>.</p>
    <p>The RPI <b>176</b> defines two logical channels: an A10 channel for data and A11 channel for signaling. A11 signaling is based on Mobile IP messages including Registration Request (“RRQ”) and Registration Reply (“RRP”), Registration Update (“RUP”) and Registration Acknowledge (“RACK”). Data from the wireless mobile node <b>78</b> may be encapsulated in GRE packets and tunneled from the PCF <b>174</b> to the PDSN <b>178</b> over an A10 channel, where it is un-encapsulated and processed further.</p>
    <p>The PDSN <b>178</b> is in communication with the source gateway <b>181</b> via a Pi interface <b>189</b>. Communications exchanged over the Pi interface <b>189</b> may be use Mobile IP or other protocol. Data sent over the Pi interface <b>189</b> may be transmitted as IP; however, other transmission protocols may be used. The source gateway <b>181</b> is in communication with the packet data network (PDN) <b>193</b>. Communications exchanged between the source gateway <b>181</b> and PDN <b>193</b> may use IP <b>48</b>, and/or other protocols.</p>
    <p>The wireless mobile node <b>78</b> may establish a PPP <b>45</b> data link <b>182</b> that terminates at the PDSN <b>178</b> as is explained below. The PPP <b>45</b> data link <b>182</b> is used to help provide a “keep-alive” point-to-point-data link for higher-level application services <b>62</b> such as VoIP, and/or H.323.</p>
    <p>PDN <b>193</b> is in communication with the home network <b>140</b>. Similar to the Pi interface <b>189</b>, communications exchanged between the PDN <b>193</b> and the home network <b>140</b> may use IP, and/or other transmission protocols. The home network <b>140</b> may contain HA <b>76</b>, and a home-network-access-control device (H-NACD) <b>191</b>. The H-NACD <b>191</b> may comprise one or more network-access servers that communicate according to the RADIUS protocol or the DIAMETER protocol. The H-NACD <b>191</b>, however, may use other protocols. The H-NACD <b>191</b> may have access to and/or maintain wireless mobile node <b>78</b> packet-data-provisioning information. This packet-data provisioning information may be stored in a user profile record (hereinafter referred to as “user profile”) in a data store that is accessible to the H-NACD <b>191</b> Further, the H-NACD <b>191</b> may authenticate and determine the parameters of a wireless mobile node's <b>78</b> packet-data session.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, the user profile contains account information for pre-paid mobile services based on individual or combinations of the measurement methods provided for the different type of services available. Some examples of measurement methods are listed in Table 1 below. However, more, fewer or other pre-paid mobile services can also be used.</p>

    <p>Broker network <b>142</b> is also in communication with the PDN <b>193</b>. Communications exchanged between the PDN <b>193</b> and broker network <b>142</b> may use Mobile IP, UDP over IP and/or other transmission protocols. Broker network <b>142</b> may contain a broker-home agent <b>195</b> and a broker-network-access-control device (B-NACD) <b>196</b>. The B-NACD <b>196</b> may comprise one or more network-access servers that communicate according to the RADIUS protocol or the DIAMETER protocol. The B-NACD <b>196</b>, however, may use other protocols. Like the H-NACD <b>191</b>, the B-NACD <b>196</b> may have access to and/or maintain wireless mobile node <b>78</b> packet-data-provisioning information. Further, the B-NACD <b>191</b> may authenticate and de-terminate the parameters of a wireless mobile node's <b>78</b> packet-data session.</p>
    <p>When roaming into a coverage area of a foreign or visited network <b>146</b>, the wireless mobile node <b>78</b> communicates over an air interface to RAN <b>183</b>. Communications transmitted over this air interface may conform to an air interface protocol of for the wireless communication format, such as EVRC. Other protocols are possible as well.</p>
    <p>RAN <b>183</b> is also in communication with the foreign PCF/RPI <b>180</b>. Communications transmitted between RAN <b>183</b> and PCF/RPI <b>180</b> may be transmitted according to a protocol such as G.711 or other wireless communication format. The PFC/RPI <b>180</b>, which provides packet data signaling and packet data transport, provides a link between RAN <b>183</b> and PDSN <b>185</b>.</p>
    <p>The PCF/RPI <b>180</b> may use an A10 channel for data and A11 channel for signaling. The A11 signaling is based on Mobile IP messages. Data from the wireless mobile node <b>78</b> may be encapsulated in GRE or other protocol packets and tunneled from the PCF/RPI <b>180</b> to the PDSN <b>185</b> over an A11 channel, where it is un-encapsulated and processed further.</p>
    <p>The PDSN <b>185</b> is in communication with the foreign gateway <b>187</b> via a second Pi interface <b>177</b>. Communications exchanged over the second Pi interface <b>177</b> may use IP, and/or other transmission protocols. The foreign gateway <b>187</b> is in communication with the PDN <b>193</b>. Communications exchanged between the foreign gateway <b>187</b> and PDN <b>193</b> may be sent according to IP <b>48</b>, or other transmission protocol.</p>
    <p>While in the coverage area of the foreign or visited network <b>146</b>, the wireless mobile node <b>78</b> may establish a PPP <b>45</b> data link <b>203</b> that terminates at the PDSN <b>185</b> as is explained below.

    <heading>7. Support for Prepaid Billing for Wireless Mobile Nodes on a Third Generation Network</heading> <p>FIG. 11 is a call flow diagram illustrating an exemplary message flow <b>500</b> for hand-off of a wireless prepaid call of mobile node <b>78</b> roaming on 3G network <b>108</b> in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. Referring to FIG. 11, the PSDN <b>178</b> provides network access, establishes a PPP <b>45</b> session, and performs prepaid billing for session activity of the wireless communication session.</p>
    <p>In an exemplary embodiment, providing network access and establishing a PPP <b>45</b> session may be accomplished by the wireless mobile node <b>78</b> initiating a communication session by sending a Traffic CHannel (“TCH”) setup message <b>502</b> to the PCF <b>174</b>. The PCF <b>174</b> sends a A11 registration request <b>504</b> to PDSN <b>178</b> on an A11 channel to request registration of the wireless mobile node <b>78</b> on network <b>108</b>. The PDSN <b>178</b> responds with a Mobile IP registration response message <b>506</b> on an A11 channel. The wireless mobile node <b>78</b> begins PPP <b>45</b> negotiations <b>508</b> with the H-NACD <b>191</b> to establish a PPP <b>45</b> session <b>182</b>.</p>
    <p>The PDSN <b>178</b> sends a RADIUS access-request message <b>510</b> for the PPP <b>45</b> session <b>182</b> over an A11 channel to the H-NACD <b>191</b>. The H-NACD <b>191</b> responds with a RADIUS access-response message <b>512</b> that includes a first block of credits, and may include one or more measurement-method parameters. The wireless mobile node <b>78</b> successfully negotiates PPP <b>45</b> with the H-NACD <b>191</b> and establishes the PPP <b>45</b> session <b>182</b> activity at <b>514</b>.</p>
    <p>Also at <b>514</b>, after session activity is established, PDSN <b>178</b> monitors usage of the PPP <b>45</b> session <b>182</b> activity and periodically measures the usage in terms of the measurement-method parameters, such as those listed in table 1 above. The PDSN <b>178</b> then debits the measured usage from first block of credits. When the number of credits in the block of credits reaches a predetermined threshold, for example, when the PDSN <b>178</b> runs out of credits, the PDSN <b>178</b> sends to the H-NACD <b>191</b> a RADIUS access-request message (not shown) for re-authentication of the PPP <b>45</b> session <b>182</b> . The H-NACD <b>191</b> responds with a RADIUS access-response message (not shown), and an additional block of credits, if enough credits are available. The H-NACD <b>191</b> may also send one or more measurement-method parameters.</p>
    <p>More information regarding an exemplary block-credit approach for wireless prepaid billing is provided by another U.S. Patent Application filed concurrently with this document, naming the same inventors, and entitled “Prepaid Billing System For Wireless Data Networks,” which is fully incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <p>At some point the wireless mobile node <b>178</b> roams into the coverage area of the PDSN <b>185</b>. The wireless mobile node <b>78</b> initiates a hard hand-off by sending a second TCH setup message <b>516</b> to the foreign PCF/RPI <b>180</b>. The foreign PCF/RPI <b>180</b> in turn sends aa A11 registration request <b>518</b> to PDSN <b>185</b> on an A11 channel to request registration of the wireless mobile node <b>78</b>. The PDSN <b>185</b> responds with an A11 registration response message <b>520</b> on an A11 channel. The wireless mobile node <b>78</b> begins PPP <b>45</b> negotiations <b>522</b> with the PDSN <b>185</b> to establish a PPP <b>45</b> session <b>203</b>. The PDSN <b>185</b> sends a RADIUS access-request message <b>524</b> for the PPP <b>45</b> session <b>203</b> over an A11 channel to the H-NACD <b>191</b>.</p>
    <p>The H-NACD <b>191</b> sends an indication, such as a RADIUS disconnect request message <b>526</b>, to terminate the session activity on PDSN <b>178</b>, and terminate the draw-down of the block of credits for the hand-off of the session activity. In response to the RADIUS disconnect request message <b>526</b>, the PDSN <b>178</b> sends a RADIUS disconnect acknowledgement message <b>528</b>. This RADIUS disconnect acknowledgement message <b>528</b> may contain credits that the PDSN <b>178</b> did not use. Alternatively, the PDSN <b>178</b> and the H-NACD <b>191</b> may exchange messages separate from the RADIUS disconnect acknowledgement message <b>528</b> for returning any unused credits.</p>
    <p>The H-NACD <b>191</b> sends to the PDSN <b>185</b> a RADIUS access-response message <b>530</b> that includes a second block of credits, and may include one or more measurement-method parameters. The wireless mobile node <b>78</b> successfully negotiates PPP <b>45</b> with the H-NACD <b>191</b> and establishes the PPP <b>45</b> session <b>203</b> activity in the second coverage area at <b>532</b>.</p>
    <p>Also at <b>532</b>, after session activity is established, PDSN <b>185</b> monitors usage of the PPP <b>45</b> session <b>203</b> activity and periodically measures the usage of the PPP <b>45</b> session <b>203</b> activity in terms of the measurement-method parameters. These measurement-method parameters may differ from the measurement-method parameters sent to PDSN <b>178</b> when the wireless mobile node <b>78</b> is in the coverage area of the PDSN <b>178</b>.</p>
    <p>In an alternative embodiment, the PDSN <b>185</b> may be associated with the broker network <b>142</b>. In such case, when wireless mobile node <b>178</b> roams into the second coverage area instead of the PDSN <b>185</b> sending a RADIUS access-request message <b>524</b> for the PPP <b>45</b> session <b>203</b> to the H-NACD <b>191</b>, the PDSN sends the RADIUS access-request message <b>524</b> to the B-NACD <b>196</b> (not shown).</p>
    <p>The B-NACD <b>196</b> (possibly via the H-NACD <b>191</b>) may send an indication, such as a RADIUS disconnect request message, to terminate the session activity on PDSN <b>178</b>, and terminate the draw-down of the block of credits for the hand-off of the session activity. In response to the RADIUS disconnect request message, the PDSN <b>178</b> sends a RADIUS disconnect acknowledgement message. This RADIUS disconnect acknowledgement message may contain any unused credits, which in turn may be appended to the cache of available credits by the B-NACD <b>196</b>.</p>
    <p>The B-NACD <b>196</b> may send to the PDSN <b>185</b> a RADIUS access-response message that includes a first block of credits, and may include one or more measurement-method parameters. The wireless mobile node <b>78</b> successfully negotiates PPP <b>45</b> with the B-NACD <b>191</b> and establishes the PPP <b>45</b> session activity.</p>
    <p>After session activity is established, PDSN <b>185</b> monitors usage of the PPP <b>45</b> session activity and periodically measures the usage of the PPP <b>45</b> session activity in terms of the measurement-method parameters. The measurement-method parameters may differ from the measurement-method parameters sent to PDSN <b>178</b> when the wireless mobile node <b>78</b> is in the coverage area of the PDSN <b>178</b>. For instance, the measurement-method parameters sent to the PDSN <b>185</b>, assuming PDSN <b>185</b> is associated with the broker network <b>142</b>, may cause the PDSN <b>185</b> to charge twice or some other multiple of the amount of credits for the same amount of usage of session activity on the PDSN <b>178</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring back to step <b>532</b>, the PDSN <b>185</b> debits the measured usage from second block of credits. When the number of credits in the block of credits reaches a predetermined threshold, it sends to the H-NACD <b>191</b> (or the B-NACD <b>196</b>) a RADIUS access-request message (not shown) for re-authentication of the PPP <b>45</b> session <b>203</b>. The H-NACD <b>191</b> (or B-NACD <b>196</b>) responds with a RADIUS access-response message (not shown), and an additional block of credits. The H-NACD <b>191</b> (or B-NACD <b>196</b>) may also send one or more measurement-method parameters.</p>
    <p>After sending the disconnect acknowledgement message <b>528</b>, the PDSN <b>178</b> sends to the PCF <b>174</b> on an A11 channel an A11 registration update message <b>534</b>. The PCF <b>174</b> responds to the request by sending to the PDSN <b>178</b> on an A11 channel an A11 request acknowledgment message <b>536</b>. The PCF <b>174</b> then sends an A11 registration update message <b>538</b> on an A11 channel to the PDSN <b>178</b> with a lifetime timer set equal to zero indicating that the wireless mobile node <b>78</b> should be de-registered. The PDSN <b>178</b> sends to the PCF <b>174</b> an A11 registration response message <b>540</b> on an A11 channel confirming the de-registration of the mobile node <b>78</b>.</p>
    <p>The foregoing call flow diagram illustrates exemplary message flow <b>500</b> for a hand-off of a wireless prepaid call on a 3G network. The foregoing description indicates carrying out a hand-off of a wireless prepaid call on a 3G network for one wireless communication session. However, hand-offs may be carried out for multiple, simultaneous wireless communications sessions as well. Since each wireless communication session is considered a separate communication session, hand-offs may be carried out for each wireless communication session in the identical or similar manner as described above. The hand-offs may be carried out in other ways as well.</p>
    <p>Various other implementations of handing off a session activity are possible. In the foregoing description the (i) network-access-control device, (ii) the H-NACD <b>191</b>, and/or (iii) the B-NACD <b>196</b> may communicate according to the client/server based RADIUS protocol and/or the peer-to peer DIAMETER protocol.</p>
    <p>As noted above, the RADIUS AAA protocol may be used for providing authentication, association, and accounting functionality to wireless packet data networks. Devices that employ the RADIUS AAA protocol are based on client/server architecture. Consequently, the server must wait until a client sends it a request before being able to notify the client of events. In other words, a RADIUS AAA server cannot notify the client of events asynchronously. The DIAMETER protocol enhances many of the features of the RADIUS protocol. One important enhancement is that the DIAMETER protocol supports peer-to-peer architecture. This type of architecture allows one network device to asynchronously notify another network device and initiate an inter-peer communication at any point in time.</p>
    <p>FIG. 12 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary portion <b>169</b> of the 3G network <b>108</b> using the DIAMETER protocol for AAA services. FIG. 12 shows exemplary portion <b>169</b>, which is similar to exemplary portion <b>170</b> (FIG. <b>10</b>).</p>
    <p>Paralleling portion <b>170</b>, the portion <b>169</b> includes a wireless mobile node <b>78</b>, a base station (“BTS”) <b>172</b>, base station controllers (“BSC”) <b>171</b> and <b>173</b>, a PCF <b>174</b>, a radio packet interface (“RPI”) <b>176</b>, a source PSDN <b>178</b>, a source gateway <b>181</b>, a radio access network (“RAN”) <b>183</b>, a foreign PDSN <b>185</b>, a foreign gateway <b>187</b>, a home network <b>140</b>, a HA <b>76</b>, a home AAA server <b>191</b>, a broker network <b>142</b>, a broker AAA server <b>201</b>, and PDN <b>193</b>.</p>
    <p>Portion <b>169</b> also includes both a home AAA server (HAAA) <b>191</b> and a broker AAA server (BAAA) <b>201</b> are configured to carry out communications according to the DIAMETER protocol. Further included in portion <b>169</b> are Redirect Server <b>199</b>, and a second packet data network (S-PDN) <b>205</b>. The S-PDN <b>205</b>, like PDN <b>193</b>, may be the Internet, and/or a public or private intranet/extranet. Thus, the S-PDN <b>205</b> may be, but need not be, the same network as PDN <b>193</b>.</p>
    <p>As described above, HA <b>76</b> is in communication with PDN <b>193</b>. Between these network nodes, communication may be transmitted according to the IP, or any other packet data transmission protocol. HAAA <b>191</b> is also in communication with the PDN <b>193</b>. Communications exchanged between the PDN <b>193</b> and the HAAA <b>191</b> are sent according to the DIAMETER protocol. Similarly, broker network <b>142</b> is in communication with the S-PDN <b>205</b> and home network <b>140</b>. Among these nodes, communications can be exchanged according to the DIAMETER protocol.</p>
    <p>Also shown in FIG. 12 is Redirect server <b>199</b> in communication with both PDN <b>193</b> and the S-PDN <b>205</b>. Communication sent over the Ri interface <b>207</b> may be sent according to a protocol that may be based on IP, a variation of IP, Mobile IP, a variation of Mobile IP, and/or other packet data transport protocol.</p>
    <p>When roaming on a foreign or visited network <b>146</b>, mobile node <b>78</b> may be in communication with RAN <b>183</b>. In turn, the RAN <b>183</b> may be in communication with PDSN <b>178</b>. PDSN <b>178</b> is in communication with the BAAA <b>201</b>, which in turn may be in communication with a HAAA <b>191</b>. Communications between the HAAA <b>191</b> and BAAA <b>201</b> may be sent according to the DIAMETER protocol, as well as other protocols. Alternatively, the PDSN <b>178</b> may communicate directly with the HAAA <b>191</b>.</p>
    <p>The following example call flow diagrams illustrate implementations using the exemplary architecture shown in FIG. <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 13 is a call flow diagram illustrating an exemplary message flow <b>600</b> for P-P hand-off a wireless prepaid call for mobile node <b>78</b> roaming on network portion <b>169</b> of 3G network <b>108</b> using the DIAMETER protocol in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. Referring to FIG. 13, the PSDN <b>178</b> provides network access, establishes a PPP <b>45</b> session, and performs prepaid billing for session activity of the wireless communication session, as shown in <b>602</b>.</p>
    <p>In an exemplary embodiment, the wireless mobile node <b>78</b> begins PPP <b>45</b> negotiations with the PDSN <b>178</b> to establish a PPP <b>45</b> session <b>182</b>. The PDSN <b>178</b> sends to the HAAA <b>191</b> a DIAMETER Auth-Request message for the PPP <b>45</b> session <b>182</b>.</p>
    <p>The Auth-Request message sent from the PDSN <b>178</b> to the HAAA <b>191</b> is used for authenticating and authorizing the PPP <b>45</b> session <b>182</b>, which may use Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) or Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) for security purposes. If the Auth-Request message is sent to the BAAA <b>201</b>, it, in turn, will forward the Auth-Request request to the HAAA <b>191</b>. The Auth-Request message may contain information to identify the user that is requesting service.</p>
    <p>The HAAA <b>191</b> queries the user profile (either locally or in a remote data store), and sends to the PDSN <b>178</b> an Auth-Accept message, which contains a first block of credits, and may include one or more measurement-method parameters and/or credit rating information. The measurement-method parameters in the Auth-Accept message may contain user profile information including usage units for subscribed services. For instance, the Auth-Accept message may contain DIAMETER attribute value pairs (AVPs) for (i) indicating that the usage should be applied on some number of bytes of use, (ii) notifying the user (via the wireless mobile <b>78</b>) of the number of bytes of credit that are available, (iii) notifying the user (via the wireless mobile node <b>78</b>) of the number bytes that remain, (iv) indicating that the user should be sent to Redirect server <b>199</b>, and/or (v) notifying the user (via the wireless mobile node <b>78</b>) that usage updates may be sent at some selected frequency.</p>
    <p>The mobile node <b>78</b> successfully negotiates PPP <b>45</b> with the HAAA <b>191</b> and establishes the PPP <b>45</b> session <b>182</b> activity. Data may be sent via the Internet and/or any other packet data network. After session activity is established, PDSN <b>178</b> monitors usage of the PPP <b>45</b> session <b>182</b> activity and periodically measures the usage of the PPP <b>45</b> session <b>182</b> activity in terms of the measurement-method parameters. The PDSN <b>178</b> debits the measured usage from the first block of credits.</p>
    <p>At some point, the wireless mobile node <b>178</b> roams into the coverage area of the PDSN <b>185</b>, as shown in <b>604</b>. After the wireless mobile node <b>78</b> sends to the PDSN <b>185</b> a registration request, the PSDN <b>185</b> initiates fast hand-off procedures according to the IS-835 protocol, as shown in <b>606</b>. The fast hand-off may be carried out by sending a P-P registration request message to the PDSN <b>178</b>. In response, the PDSN <b>178</b> sends a P-P registration reply message to PDSN <b>185</b> to confirm the request to tunnel the session activity of the wireless communication session to the PDSN <b>185</b>. Other PDSN to PDSN protocols may be used as well.</p>
    <p>Once the P-P communication is established, session activity of the wireless communication session is passed between the PDSN <b>178</b> and PDSN <b>185</b>, as shown in <b>610</b>. Also after the P-P communication is established, PDSN <b>178</b>, performs session activity monitoring, measuring, and accounting as if the session activity is not tunneled to the PDSN <b>185</b>, as shown in <b>612</b>. Accordingly, the PDSN <b>178</b> monitors usage of the PPP <b>45</b> session <b>182</b> activity tunneled to the PDSN <b>185</b>. The PDSN <b>178</b> also periodically measures the usage of the PPP <b>45</b> session <b>182</b> activity tunneled to the PDSN <b>185</b> in terms of the measurement-method parameters. The PDSN <b>178</b> then debits the measured usage of tunneled session activity from the first or additional block of credits received by the PDSN <b>178</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in <b>614</b>, the mobile node <b>78</b> performs a hard hand-off to the PDSN <b>185</b>, causing the PDSN <b>178</b> to terminate any session activity and return unused credits to the HAAA <b>191</b>, so that the unused credits may be returned to the cache of available credits.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, the PDSN <b>178</b> sends to the PDSN <b>185</b> unused credits, if any such credits remain, as shown in <b>616</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the PDSN <b>185</b> sends a P-P registration request message containing a request for unused credits. In reply, the PDSN <b>178</b> may send to the PDSN <b>185</b> a P-P registration reply message containing the unused credits. The PDSN <b>185</b> debits the measured usage from unused credits and/or the second block of credits.</p>
    <p>At <b>618</b>, the PDSN <b>185</b> may send to HAAA <b>191</b> accounting data after hand-off. During a state transition, such as such as when the session activity goes from active to dormant state, from an active to inactive state, or any other state transition, the PDSN <b>185</b> may effectuate an exemplary hand-off procedure by establishing independent session activity at <b>618</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the wireless mobile node <b>78</b> begins PPP <b>45</b> negotiations with the PDSN <b>185</b> to establish a PPP <b>45</b> session <b>203</b>. The PDSN <b>185</b> sends to the HAAA <b>191</b> a DIAMETER Auth-Request message for the PPP <b>45</b> session <b>203</b>.</p>
    <p>The HAAA <b>191</b> queries the user profile (either locally or in a remote data store), and if eligible for wireless prepaid service, the HAAA <b>191</b> sends to the PDSN <b>185</b> an Auth-Accept message, which may contain a second block of credits, and may include one or more measurement-method parameters or credit rating information. The measurement-method parameters in the Auth-Accept message may contain user profile information including usage units for subscribed services. The Auth-Accept message may contain DIAMETER attribute value pairs (AVPs) for (i) indicating that the usage should be applied on some number of bytes or some measure of time of use, (ii) notifying the user (via the mobile node <b>78</b>) of the number credits that are available, (iii) notifying the user (via the mobile node <b>78</b>) of the number bytes or amount of time that remain, (iv) indicating that the user should be sent to redirect server <b>199</b>, and/or (v) notifying the user (via the mobile node <b>78</b>) that usage updates may be sent at some selected frequency.</p>
    <p>The mobile node <b>78</b> successfully negotiates PPP <b>45</b> with the HAAA <b>191</b> and establishes the PPP <b>45</b> session <b>203</b> activity via PDSN <b>185</b>. Data may be sent via the Internet and/or any other packet data network. After session activity is established, PDSN <b>185</b> monitors usage of the PPP <b>45</b> session <b>203</b> activity and periodically measures the usage of the PPP <b>45</b> session <b>203</b> activity in terms of the received measurement-method parameters.</p>
    <p>At <b>620</b>, the HAAA <b>191</b> sends a halt indication to the PDSN <b>178</b>, which causes the PDSN <b>178</b> to terminate any monitoring and measuring of the session activity. Further the halt indication may also cause the PDSN <b>178</b> to stop debiting any usage of the session activity and return unused credits to the HAAA <b>191</b>, so that the unused credits may be returned to the cache of available credits.</p>
    <p>FIG. 14 is a call flow diagram illustrating an exemplary message flow <b>700</b> for P-P hand-off a wireless prepaid call for mobile node <b>78</b> roaming on network portion <b>169</b> 3G network <b>108</b> using the DIAMETER protocol in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. FIG. 14 shows the exemplary message flow <b>700</b>, which is similar to the exemplary message flow <b>600</b>, except as described herein.</p>
    <p>If associated with BAAA <b>201</b>, the PDSN <b>185</b> and the BAAA <b>201</b> perform accounting procedures after establishing independent session activity, as shown in <b>652</b>. These accounting procedures may be performed over a secure link, such as a SSL link, according to the DIAMETER protocol. The accounting procedures, however, may be carried out in other ways. Exemplary accounting procedures may include (i) replenishing used credits, and (ii) purchasing new credits for prepaid services. At <b>654</b>, the BAAA <b>201</b> sends a DIAMETER Auth-Request message for the to the HAAA <b>191</b> over the secure link. The DIAMETER Auth-Request message may request prepaid billing information from the user profile for the wireless mobile node.</p>
    <p>The HAAA <b>191</b> queries the user profile (either locally or in a remote data store), and if eligible for wireless prepaid service, the HAAA <b>191</b> sends to the BAAA <b>201</b> an Auth-Accept message, which may contain a second block of credits, and may include one or more measurement-method parameters and/or credit rating information. The measurement-method parameters in the Auth-Accept message may contain user profile information including usage units for subscribed services. The Auth-Accept message may contain DIAMETER attribute value pairs (AVPs), as described above.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, the BAAA <b>201</b> may act as a proxy to the HAAA <b>191</b>, which allows the BAAA <b>201</b> to appear as the HAAA <b>191</b> to the PDSN <b>185</b>. Thus, as a proxy, the BAAA <b>201</b> allows for replenishing used credits and purchasing new credits for prepaid services by the PDSN <b>185</b> as if the BAAA <b>201</b> is the HAAA <b>191</b>. That is, the BAAA <b>201</b> can act with transparency to the PDSN <b>185</b>, and allows for seamless roaming in with accurate measuring of session activity usage. As noted above, exemplary accounting procedures may be found in another U.S. Patent Application filed concurrently with this document, naming the same inventors, and entitled “Prepaid Billing System For Wireless Data Networks.”</p>
    <p>As shown in <b>656</b>, the BAAA <b>201</b> may use alternative measurement-method parameters for measuring the usage of the session activity. For example, the user profile for the wireless mobile node <b>78</b> may contain a subscription to basic wireless prepaid service in which the measurement-methods parameters while carrying on a session activity in home network <b>140</b> draws down credits at rate C(h), The basic wireless prepaid service contained in the user profile may require that credit draw-down in a broker network <b>142</b> is performed at rate C(v). When a BAAA <b>201</b> receives a request for a block of credits from PDSN <b>185</b>, the BAAA <b>201</b> may be provided with or have measurement-method parameters that contain an algorithm that adjusts for difference between C(h) and C(v). For example, the measurement-method parameters may contain an indication that specifies that each credit of the block of credits sent to the PDSN <b>185</b> are applied at half the value. Other algorithms may also apply.</p>
