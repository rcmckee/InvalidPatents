    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="p-0004">Preferred embodiments of this invention relate to sensing systems and methods for a motion-controlled limb and, in particular, an ankle-motion-controlled foot.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="p-0006">Millions of individuals worldwide rely on prosthetic and/or orthotic devices to compensate for disabilities, such as amputation or debilitation, and to assist in the rehabilitation of injured limbs. Orthotic devices include external apparatuses used to support, align, prevent, protect, correct deformities of, or improve the function of movable parts of the body. Prosthetic devices include apparatuses used as artificial substitutes for a missing body part, such as an arm or leg.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">The number of disabled persons and amputees is increasing each year as the average age of individuals increases, as does the prevalence of debilitating diseases such as diabetes. As a result, the need for prosthetic and orthotic devices is also increasing. Conventional orthoses are often used to support a joint, such as an ankle or a knee, of an individual, and movement of the orthosis is generally based solely on the energy expenditure of the user. Some conventional prostheses are equipped with basic controllers that artificially mobilize the joints without any interaction from the amputee and are capable of generating only basic motions. Such basic controllers do not take into consideration the dynamic conditions of the working environment. The passive nature of these conventional prosthetic and orthotic devices typically leads to movement instability, high energy expenditure on the part of the disabled person or amputee, gait deviations and other short- and long-term negative effects. This is especially true for leg orthoses and prostheses.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0008">Accordingly, one embodiment of the invention includes a prosthetic or orthotic system that is self-powered and that mimics the natural movement of a healthy limb, and in particular, the movement of a healthy ankle.

As used herein, the term “attachment member” is a broad term and is used in its ordinary sense and in a prosthetic foot embodiment relates to, without limitation, any member that attaches either directly or indirectly to the foot unit <b>104</b> and is moveable in relation thereto, for example by a pivoting motion, and is used to attach the prosthesis <b>100</b> to a stump or intermediate prosthesis. As illustrated, the attachment member may take the form of a lower limb member in an ankle-prosthesis embodiment. In other embodiments, for example an orthotic embodiment, the attachment member may be used to attach to and support a body part, such as with a brace, which also is moveably connected to a second member, such as a foot unit, which would also attach to and support a body part, such as the foot. In one embodiment, the lower limb member <b>102</b> is a generally elongated member with a main longitudinal axis that extends in approximately a tibial direction, that is, a direction that extends generally along the axis of a natural tibia bone. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts the lower limb member <b>102</b> as being a generally vertical orientation.</p>
    <p num="p-0075">In another embodiment, the lower limb member <b>102</b> may comprise multiple sections. For example, the lower limb member <b>102</b> may comprise two elongated sections that extend approximately parallel in a tibial direction and that are connected together. In another embodiment, the lower limb member <b>102</b> comprises a two-sided chamber having two substantially symmetrical parts to form a partially enclosed housing. In another embodiment, the lower limb member <b>102</b> may comprise a hollow member, such as a tube-like structure. In other embodiments, the lower limb member <b>102</b> may comprise elongated flat portions or rounded portions. In yet other embodiments, the structure of the lower limb member <b>102</b> is not elongated. For example, the lower limb member <b>102</b> may comprise a generally circular, cylindrical, half-circular, dome-shaped, oval or rectangular structure. One example of a possible lower limb member is the ankle module and the structures described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/742,455, filed Dec. 18, 2003, and entitled “PROSTHETIC FOOT WITH ROCKER MEMBER,” the entirety of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference and is to be considered as part of this specification.</p>
    <p num="p-0076">In one embodiment, the lower limb member <b>102</b> is generally formed of a machine metal, such as aluminum, or a carbon fiber material. In other embodiments of the invention, the lower limb member <b>102</b> may comprise other materials that are suitable for prosthetic devices. In one embodiment, the lower limb member <b>102</b> advantageously has a height between approximately 12 and 15 centimeters. In other embodiments of the invention, the lower limb member <b>102</b> may have a height less than 12 centimeters or height greater than 15 centimeters depending on the size of the user and/or the intended use of the prosthesis <b>100</b>. For example, the lower limb member <b>102</b> may have a height of approximately 20 centimeters.</p>
    <p num="p-0077">In one embodiment, the prosthesis <b>100</b> is configured such that the main longitudinal axis of the lower limb member <b>102</b> is substantially perpendicular to a lower surface of the foot unit <b>104</b> when the prosthesis <b>100</b> is in a resting position. In another embodiment, the lower limb member <b>102</b> may be substantially perpendicular to a level ground surface when the foot unit <b>104</b> rests on the ground. Such a configuration advantageously provides a user with increased support and/or stability.</p>
    <p num="p-0078">As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the lower limb member <b>102</b> further comprises a cover <b>106</b>. The cover <b>106</b> houses and/or protects the inner components of the lower limb member <b>102</b>. In another embodiment, the cover <b>106</b> may be rounded or may be shaped in the form of a natural human leg.</p>
    <p num="p-0079">The lower limb member <b>102</b> further comprises an attachment portion <b>108</b> to facilitate coupling of the lower limb member <b>102</b>. For example, as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the attachment portion <b>108</b> of the lower limb member <b>102</b> couples the prosthesis <b>100</b> to a pylon <b>110</b>. In other embodiments of the invention, the attachment portion <b>108</b> may be configured to couple the prosthesis <b>100</b> to a stump of an amputee or to another prosthetic device. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also depicts a control wire <b>112</b> usable to provide power to and/or communicate control signals to the prosthesis <b>100</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0080">The foot unit <b>104</b> may comprise various types of prosthetic or orthotic feet. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the foot unit <b>104</b> incorporates a design described in Applicant's co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/642,125, entitled “LOW PROFILE PROSTHETIC FOOT,” and filed Aug. 15, 2003 the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference and is to be considered as part of this specification. For example, the foot unit <b>104</b> may comprise a standard LP VARI-FLEX® unit available from Össur.</p>
    <p num="p-0081">In one embodiment, the foot unit <b>104</b> is configured to exert a proportional response to weight or impact levels on the foot unit <b>104</b>. In addition, the foot unit <b>104</b> may comprise shock absorption for comfortable loading of the heel and/or for returning expended energy. The foot unit <b>104</b> may comprise a full-length toe lever with enhanced flexibility so as to provide a stride length for the prosthetic limb that mimics the stride length of the healthy limb. In addition, as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the foot unit <b>104</b> may comprise a split-toe configuration, which facilitates movement on uneven terrain. The foot unit <b>104</b> may also include a cosmesis or a foot cover such as, for example, a standard Flex-Foot cover available from Össur.</p>
    <p num="p-0082"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts the prosthesis <b>100</b> with the cover <b>106</b> removed. As shown, a lower end of the lower limb member <b>102</b> is coupled to the foot unit <b>104</b> at a pivot assembly <b>114</b>. As illustrated, the lower limb member <b>102</b> is coupled to an ankle plate of the foot unit <b>104</b>, which extends generally rearward and upward from a toe portion of the foot unit <b>104</b>. The pivot assembly <b>114</b> allows for angular movement of the foot unit <b>104</b> with respect to the lower limb member <b>102</b>. For example, in one embodiment, the pivot assembly <b>114</b> advantageously comprises at least one pivot pin. In other embodiments, the pivot assembly <b>114</b> comprises a hinge, a multi-axial configuration, a polycentric configuration, combinations of the same or the like. Preferably, the pivot assembly <b>114</b> is located on a portion of the foot unit <b>104</b> that is near a natural ankle location of the foot unit <b>104</b>. In other embodiments of the invention, the pivot assembly <b>114</b> may be bolted or otherwise releasably connected to the foot unit <b>104</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0083"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> further depicts the prosthesis <b>100</b> having an actuator <b>116</b>. In one embodiment, the actuator <b>116</b> advantageously provides the prosthesis <b>100</b> with the necessary energy to execute angular displacements synchronized with the amputee's locomotion. For example, the actuator <b>116</b> may cause the foot unit <b>104</b> to move similar to a natural human foot. In one embodiment, the lower end of the actuator <b>116</b> is coupled to the foot unit <b>104</b> at a first attachment point <b>118</b>. As illustrated, the foot attachment point <b>118</b> is advantageously located on the upper surface of the foot unit <b>104</b> on a posterior portion thereof. The upper end of the actuator <b>116</b> is coupled to the lower limb member <b>102</b> at a second attachment point <b>120</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0084">In one embodiment, the linear motion (or extension and contraction) of the actuator <b>116</b> controls, or actively adjusts, the angle between the foot unit <b>104</b> and the lower limb member <b>102</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts the actuator <b>116</b> comprising a double-screw motor, wherein the motor pushes or pulls a posterior portion of the foot unit <b>104</b> with respect to the lower limb member <b>102</b>. In other embodiments, the actuator <b>116</b> comprises other mechanisms capable of actively adjusting an angle, or providing for motion between, multiple members. For example, the actuator <b>116</b> may comprise a single-screw motor, a piston cylinder-type structure, a servomotor, a stepper motor, a rotary motor, a spring, a fluid actuator, or the like. In yet other embodiments, the actuator <b>116</b> may actively adjust in only one direction, the angle between the lower limb member <b>102</b> and the foot unit <b>104</b>. In such an embodiment, the weight of the user may also be used in controlling the angle caused by and/or the movement of the actuator <b>116</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0085"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the actuator <b>116</b> in a posterior configuration, wherein the actuator <b>116</b> is located behind the lower limb member <b>102</b>. In other embodiments, the actuator <b>116</b> may be used in an anterior configuration, wherein the actuator <b>116</b> is located in front of the lower limb member <b>102</b>. In another embodiment of the invention, the actuator <b>116</b> comprises an auto adjusting ankle structure and incorporates a design, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,957,981, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference and is to be considered as a part of this specification. The particular configuration or structure may be selected to most closely imitate the movement and location of a natural human ankle joint and to facilitate insertion of the prosthesis <b>100</b> into an outer cosmesis.</p>
    <p num="p-0086">Furthermore, the actuator <b>116</b> is advantageously configured to operate so as to not to emit loud noises, such as intermittent noises, perceptible by the user and/or others. The actuator <b>116</b> may also be configured to not operate or adjust if the prosthesis <b>100</b> experiences torque, such as in the sagittal plane, that exceeds a certain level. For example, if the torque level exceeds four Newton meters (Nm), the actuator <b>116</b> may cease to operate or may issue an alarm.</p>
    <p num="p-0087">The actuator <b>116</b> may also be substantially enclosed within the cover <b>106</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> such that the portions of the actuator <b>116</b> are not visible and/or exposed to the environment. In another embodiment, the actuator may be at least partially enclosed by the lower limb member <b>102</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0088"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> further depicts control circuitry <b>122</b> usable to control the operation of the actuator <b>116</b> and/or the foot unit <b>104</b>. In one embodiment, the control circuitry <b>122</b> comprises at least one printed circuit board (PCB). The PCB may further comprise a microprocessor. Software may also reside on the PCB so as to perform signal processing and/or control the movement of the prosthesis <b>100</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0089">In one embodiment, the prosthesis <b>100</b> includes a battery (not shown) that powers the control circuitry <b>122</b> and/or the actuator <b>116</b>. In one embodiment, the battery comprises a rechargeable lithium ion battery that preferably has a power cycle of at least 12 to 16 hours. In yet other embodiments, the power cycle of the battery may be less than 12 hours or may be more than 16 hours. In other embodiments of the invention, the battery comprises a lithium polymer battery, fuel cell technology, or other types of batteries or technology usable to provide power to the prosthesis <b>100</b>. In yet other embodiments, the battery is removably attached to a rear surface of the lower limb member <b>102</b>, to other portions of the prosthesis <b>100</b>, or is located remote the prosthesis <b>100</b>. In further embodiments, the prosthesis <b>100</b> may be connected to an external power source, such as through a wall adapter or car adapter, to recharge the battery.</p>
    <p num="p-0090">In one embodiment, the prosthesis <b>100</b> is configured to lock in a neutral position, such as the lower limb member <b>102</b> being aligned generally vertical relative to a level ground surface when the foot unit <b>104</b> is resting on the level ground surface, when the battery is out of power or enters a low power stage. Such locking provides for operational safety, reliability, and/or stability for a user. The prosthesis <b>100</b> may also provide a battery status display that alerts the user as to the status (i.e., charge) of the battery. In another embodiment, the prosthesis <b>100</b> locks into a substantially neutral position when the motion control functions of the prosthesis <b>100</b> are turned off or disabled by a user.</p>
    <p num="p-0091">As discussed above, a cosmesis material or other dressings may be used with the prosthesis <b>100</b> so as to give the prosthesis <b>100</b> a more natural look or shape. In addition, the cosmesis, dressings, or other filler material may be used to prevent contaminants, such as dirt or water, from contacting the components of the prosthesis <b>100</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0092"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a side view of the prosthesis <b>100</b> according to one embodiment of the invention. As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the actuator <b>116</b> further comprises a main housing <b>124</b>, a lower extendable portion <b>126</b>, and an upper extendable portion <b>128</b>. The lower extendable portion <b>126</b> couples the main housing <b>124</b> of the actuator <b>116</b> to the foot unit <b>104</b> at the first attachment point <b>118</b>. The upper extendable portion <b>128</b> couples the main housing <b>124</b> of the actuator <b>116</b> to the lower limb member <b>102</b> at the second attachment point <b>120</b>. During operation and active adjustment of the prosthesis <b>100</b>, the lower extendable portion <b>126</b> and/or the upper extendable portion <b>128</b> move into and/or out of the main housing <b>124</b> of the actuator <b>116</b> to adjust an angle between the foot unit <b>104</b> and the lower limb member <b>102</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0093">For example, to increase an angle between the foot unit <b>104</b> and the lower limb member <b>102</b>, the actuator <b>116</b> causes the lower extendable portion <b>126</b> and/or the upper extendable portion <b>128</b> to contract or withdraw into the main housing <b>124</b>. For example, at least one of the extendable portions <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> may have a threaded surface such that rotation in one direction (e.g., clockwise) causes the extendable portion to withdraw into the main housing <b>124</b> of the actuator. In other embodiments, at least one of the extendable portions <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> comprises multiple telescoping pieces such that, upon contraction, one of the multiple pieces of extendable portion contracts into another of the multiple pieces without withdrawing into the main housing <b>124</b>. Likewise, to decrease an angle between the foot unit <b>104</b> and the lower limb member <b>102</b>, the lower extendable portion <b>126</b> and/or the upper extendable portion <b>128</b> may extend from the main housing <b>124</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0094">In embodiments of the invention having an anterior configuration for the actuator <b>116</b>, extension of the lower extendable portion <b>126</b> and/or the upper extendable portion <b>128</b> causes an increase in the angle between the lower limb member <b>102</b> and the foot unit <b>104</b>. Likewise, a contraction of the lower extendable portion <b>126</b> and/or the upper extendable portion <b>128</b> causes a decrease in the angle between the foot unit <b>104</b> and the lower limb member <b>102</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0095"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a rear view of the prosthesis <b>100</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. In other embodiments of the invention, the cover <b>106</b> extends around the posterior portion of the prosthesis <b>100</b> to house at least a portion of the actuator <b>116</b> such that portions of the actuator <b>116</b> are not visible and/or not exposed to the environment.</p>
    <p num="p-0096"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> illustrate one embodiment of the prosthesis <b>100</b> as it adjusts to inclines and declines. With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the prosthesis <b>100</b> is depicted as adjusting to an incline. In this embodiment, the actuator <b>116</b> extends so as to decrease an angle θ between the lower limb member <b>102</b> and the foot unit <b>104</b> (or “dorsiflexion”). With respect to dorsiflexion, in one embodiment, the angular range of motion of the prosthesis <b>100</b> is from about 0 to 10 degrees from the neutral position. Other embodiments may also facilitate exaggerated dorsiflexion during swing phase.</p>
    <p num="p-0097"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the prosthesis <b>100</b> as it adjusts to a decline. The actuator <b>116</b> extends so as to increase the angle θ between the lower limb member <b>102</b> and the foot unit <b>104</b> (or “plantarflexion”). With respect to plantarflexion, in one embodiment, the angular range of motion of the prosthesis <b>100</b> is from about 0 to 20 degrees from the neutral position. Such plantarflexion mimics natural ankle movement and provides for greater stability to an amputee or a user. In one embodiment, the total range of motion about the ankle pivot axis of the prosthesis <b>100</b>, including both plantarflexion and dorsiflexion, is approximately 30 degrees or more.</p>
    <p num="p-0098">In addition to operating on inclines and declines, the motion-controlled foot of the prosthesis <b>100</b> advantageously accommodates different terrain, operates while traveling up and down stairs, and facilitates level ground walking. In addition, the prosthesis <b>100</b> may provide for automatic heel height adjustability. Heel height may be measured, in one embodiment, from an ankle portion of the lower limb member <b>102</b> to a ground surface when the foot unit <b>104</b> is generally flat to the ground. For example, a user may adjust to various heel heights, such as through pressing one or more buttons, such that the prosthesis <b>100</b> automatically aligns itself to the appropriate heel height. In one embodiment, the prosthesis <b>100</b> includes a plurality of predetermined heel heights. In yet other embodiments, the prosthesis <b>100</b> may automatically adjust the heel height without the need for user input.</p>
    <p num="p-0099"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> further illustrate one embodiment of the attachment portion <b>108</b>. The attachment portion <b>108</b> provides alignment between the natural limb of the amputee and the prosthesis <b>100</b> and may be configured so as to decrease pressure peaks and shear forces. For example, the attachment portion <b>108</b> may be configured to attach to another prosthesis, to the stump of the amputee, or to another component. In one embodiment, the attachment portion <b>108</b> comprises a socket connector. The socket connector may be configured to receive a 32 mm-thread component, a male pyramid type coupler, or other components. In other embodiments, the attachment portion <b>108</b> may also comprise, or be configured to receive, a female pyramid adapter.</p>
    <p num="p-0100">As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the pivot assembly <b>114</b> is positioned to mimic a normal human ankle axis. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> further illustrates a schematic drawing indicating the correlation between an ankle pivot point on a prosthetic foot unit <b>204</b> with the natural human ankle joint of a foot. In particular, the prosthetic foot unit <b>204</b> comprises a pivot assembly <b>214</b> that corresponds to an ankle joint <b>240</b> of a human foot <b>242</b>. For example, in one embodiment of the invention, the pivot assembly <b>114</b> is located near the mechanical ankle center of rotation of the prosthesis <b>100</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0101"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a graph depicting the possible range of ankle motion of an embodiment of the prosthesis <b>100</b> during one full stride on a level surface. As shown, the x-axis of the graph represents various points during one full stride of a user (i.e., 0 to 100 percent). The y-axis represents the ankle angle (Δ) of the prosthesis <b>100</b> relative to the ankle angle when the prosthesis is in a neutral position. During one full stride, the ankle angle (Δ) varies from approximately 20 degrees plantarflexion (i.e., neutral position angle +20 degrees) to approximately 10 degrees dorsiflexion (i.e., neutral position angle −10 degrees).</p>
    <p num="p-0102">In embodiments as described above, no dampening is provided when adjusting the angular range of motion. In another embodiment of the invention, the prosthesis <b>100</b> is configured to provide dampening or passive, soft resistance to changes in the angle between the lower limb member <b>102</b> and the foot unit <b>104</b>. An example of a system for controlling such dampening is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,443,993, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference and is to be considered as a part of this specification.</p>
    <p num="p-0103">For example, when the user is in a standing position, the actuator <b>116</b> may provide for increased resistance, or dampening, so as to provide stability to the user. In one embodiment of the invention, dampening of the prosthesis <b>100</b> may be provided by hydraulic dampers. In other embodiments of the invention, other components or devices that are known in the art may be used to provide dampening for the prosthesis <b>100</b>. In addition, in one embodiment of the invention, the dampers may be dynamically controlled, such as through an electronic control system, which is discussed in more detail below. In yet other embodiments, the dampers may be controlled through mechanical and/or fluid-type structures.</p>
    <p num="p-0104">It is also recognized that, although the above description has been directed generally to prosthetic systems and devices, the description may also apply to an embodiment of the invention having an orthotic system or device. For example, in one embodiment of the invention, an orthotic system may comprise at least one actuator that actively controls the angle of an orthosis that is used with an injured or debilitated ankle. In addition, the orthotic system may, in addition to the electronic control of the orthotic system, provide for the user's control or natural movement of the injured ankle or leg.</p>
    <p num="p-0105">In addition, the above-described systems may be implemented in prosthetic or orthotic systems other than transtibial, or below-the-knee, systems. For example, in one embodiment of the invention, the prosthetic or orthotic system may be used in a transfemoral, or above-the-knee, system, such as is disclosed in U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/569,512, filed May 7, 2004, and entitled “MAGNETORHEOLOGICALLY ACTUATED PROSTHETIC KNEE;” U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/624,986, filed Nov. 3, 2004, and entitled “MAGNETORHEOLOGICALLY ACTUATED PROSTHETIC KNEE;” and U.S. patent application Ser.

In other embodiments of the invention the control system <b>300</b> is usable by an orthotic system or a rehabilitation system having an ankle-motion-controlled foot, or other motion-controlled limb. In one embodiment, the control system <b>300</b> is based on a distributed processing system wherein the different functions performed by the prosthetic or orthotic system, such as sensing, data processing, and actuation, are performed or controlled by multiple processors that communicate with each other. With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the control system <b>300</b> includes a sensor module <b>302</b>, an ankle device <b>304</b> (such as, for example, the prosthesis <b>100</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), a central processing unit (“CPU”) <b>305</b>, a memory <b>306</b>, an interface module <b>308</b>, a control drive module <b>310</b>, an actuator <b>316</b> and a power module <b>318</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0107">In one embodiment, the control system <b>300</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> processes data received from the sensing module <b>302</b> with the CPU <b>305</b>. The CPU <b>305</b> communicates with the control drive module <b>310</b> to control the operation of the actuator <b>316</b> so as to mimic natural ankle movement by the ankle device <b>304</b>. Furthermore, the control system <b>300</b> may predict how the ankle device <b>304</b> may need to be adjusted in order to accommodate movement by the user. The CPU <b>305</b> may also receive commands from a user and/or other device through the interface module <b>308</b>. The power module <b>318</b> provides power to the other components of the control system <b>300</b>. Each of these components is described in more detail below.</p>
    <p num="p-0108">In one embodiment, the sensor module <b>302</b> is used to measure variables relating to the ankle device <b>304</b>, such as the position and/or the movement of the ankle device <b>304</b> throughout a gait cycle. In such an embodiment the sensor module <b>320</b> is advantageously located on the ankle device <b>304</b>.

In such an embodiment, the sensors are used to capture information relating to the movement of the natural limb on the user's ankle-device side to adjust the ankle device <b>304</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0109">In one embodiment, the sensor module <b>302</b> advantageously includes a printed circuit board housing, multiple sensors, such as accelerometers, which each measures an acceleration of the ankle device <b>304</b> in a different axis. For example, the sensor module <b>302</b> may comprise three accelerometers that measure acceleration of the ankle device <b>304</b> in three substantially, mutually perpendicular axes. Sensors of the type suitable for the sensor module <b>302</b> are available from, for example, Dynastream Innovations, Inc. (Alberta, Canada).</p>
    <p num="p-0110">In other embodiments, the sensor module <b>302</b> may include one or more other types of sensors in combination with, or in place of, accelerometers. For example, the sensor module <b>302</b> may include a gyroscope configured to measure the angular speed of body segments and/or the ankle device <b>304</b>. In other embodiments, the sensor module <b>302</b> includes a plantar pressure sensor configured to measure, for example, the vertical plantar pressure of a specific underfoot area. In yet other embodiments, the sensor module <b>302</b> may include one or more of the following: kinematic sensors, single-axis gyroscopes, single- or multi-axis accelerometers, load sensors, flex sensors or myoelectric sensors that may be configured to capture data from the user's natural limb. U.S. Pat. No. 5,955,667, U.S. Pat. No. 6,301,964, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,513,381, also illustrate examples of sensors that may be used with embodiments of the invention, which patents are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties and are to be considered as part of this specification.</p>
    <p num="p-0111">Furthermore, the sensor module <b>302</b> may be used to capture information relating to, for example, one or more of the following: the position of the ankle device <b>304</b> with respect to the ground; the inclination angle of the ankle device <b>304</b>; the direction of gravity with respect to the position of the ankle device <b>304</b>; information that relates to a stride of the user, such as when the ankle device <b>304</b> contacts the ground (e.g., “heel strike”), is in mid-stride, or leaves the ground (e.g., “toe-off”), the distance from the ground of the prosthesis <b>100</b> at the peak of the swing phase (i.e., the maximum height during the swing phase); the timing of the peak of the swing phase; and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0112">In yet other embodiments, the sensor module <b>302</b> is configured to detect gait patterns and/or events. For example, the sensor module <b>302</b> may determine whether the user is in a standing/stopped position, is walking on level ground, is ascending and/or descending stairs or sloped surfaces, or the like. In other embodiments, the sensor module <b>302</b> is configured to detect or measure the heel height of the ankle device <b>304</b> and/or determine a static shank angle in order to detect when the user is in a sitting position.</p>
    <p num="p-0113">As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, in one embodiment of the invention, the sensor module <b>302</b> is further configured to measure environmental or terrain variables including one or more of the following: the characteristics of the ground surface, the angle of the ground surface, the air temperature and wind resistance. In one embodiment, the measured temperature may be used to calibrate the gain and/or bias of other sensors.</p>
    <p num="p-0114">In other embodiments, the sensor module <b>302</b> captures information about the movement and/or position of a user's natural limb, such as a healthy leg. In such an embodiment, it may be preferable that when operating on an incline or a decline, the first step of the user be taken with the healthy leg. Such would allow measurements taken from the natural movement of the healthy leg prior to adjusting the ankle device <b>304</b>. In one embodiment of the invention, the control system <b>300</b> detects the gait of the user and adjusts the ankle device <b>304</b> accordingly while the ankle device <b>304</b> is in a swing phase of the first step. In other embodiments of the invention, there may be a latency period in which the control system <b>300</b> requires one or two strides before being able to accurately determine the gait of the user and to adjust the ankle device <b>304</b> appropriately.</p>
    <p num="p-0115">In one embodiment of the invention, the sensor module <b>302</b> has a default sampling rate of 100 hertz (Hz). In other embodiments, the sampling rate may be higher or lower than 100 Hz or may be adjustable by a user, or may be adjusted automatically by software or parameter settings. In addition, the sensor module <b>302</b> may provide for synchronization between types of data being sensed or include time stamping. The sensors may also be configured so as to have an angular resolution of approximately 0.5 degrees, allowing for fine adjustments of the ankle device <b>304</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0116">In one embodiment, the sensor module <b>302</b> is configured to power down into a “sleep” mode when sensing is not needed, such as for example, when the user is relaxing while in a sitting or reclining position. In such an embodiment, the sensor module <b>302</b> may awake from the sleep state upon movement of the sensor module <b>302</b> or upon input from the user. In one embodiment, the sensor module <b>302</b> consumes approximately 30 milliamps (mA) when in an “active” mode and approximately 0.1 mA when in a “sleep” mode.</p>
    <p num="p-0117"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates the sensor module <b>302</b> communicating with the CPU <b>305</b>. In one embodiment, the sensor module <b>302</b> advantageously provides measurement data to the CPU <b>305</b> and/or to other components of the control system <b>300</b>. In one embodiment, the sensor module <b>302</b> is coupled to a transmitter, such as, for example, a Bluetooth® transmitter, that transmits the measurements to the CPU <b>305</b>. In other embodiments, other types of transmitters or wireless technology may be used, such as infrared, WiFi®, or radio frequency (RF) technology. In other embodiments, wired technologies may be used to communicate with the CPU <b>305</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0118">In one embodiment, the sensor module <b>302</b> sends a data string to the CPU <b>305</b> that comprises various types of information. For example, the data string may comprise 160 bits and include the following information:
</p> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0118">[TS; AccX; AccY; AccZ; GyroX, GyroY, GyroZ, DegX, DegY, FS, M];</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p num="p-0119">wherein TS=Timestamp; AccX=linear acceleration of foot along X axis; AccY=linear acceleration of foot along Y axis; AccZ=linear acceleration of foot along Z axis; GyroX=angular acceleration of foot along X axis; GyroY=angular acceleration of foot along Y axis; GyroZ=angular acceleration of foot along Z axis; DegX=foot inclination angle in coronal plane; DegY=foot inclination angle in sagittal plane; FS=logic state of switches in the ankle device <b>304</b>; and M=orientation of the sensors. In other embodiments of the invention, other lengths of data strings comprising more or less information may be used.</p>
    <p num="p-0120">The CPU <b>305</b> advantageously processes data received from other components of the control system <b>300</b>. In one embodiment of the invention, the CPU <b>305</b> processes information relating to the gait of the user, such as information received from the sensor module <b>302</b>, determines locomotion type (i.e., gait pattern), and/or sends commands to the control drive module <b>310</b>. For example, the data captured by the sensor module <b>302</b> may be used to generate a waveform that portrays information relating to the gait or movement of the user. Subsequent changes to the waveform may be identified by the CPU <b>305</b> to predict future movement of the user and to adjust the ankle device <b>304</b> accordingly. In one embodiment of the invention, the CPU <b>305</b> may detect gait patterns from as slow as 20 steps per minute to as high as 125 steps per minute. In other embodiments of the invention, the CPU <b>305</b> may detect gait patterns that are slower than 20 steps per minute or higher than 125 steps per minute.</p>
    <p num="p-0121">In one embodiment of the invention, the CPU <b>305</b> processes data relating to state transitions according to the following table (TABLE 1). In particular, TABLE 1 shows possible state transitions usable with the control system <b>300</b>. The first column of TABLE 1 lists possible initial states of the ankle device <b>304</b>, and the first row lists possible second states of the ankle device <b>304</b>. The body of TABLE 1 identifies the source of data used by the CPU <b>305</b> in controlling, or actively adjusting, the actuator <b>316</b> and the ankle device <b>304</b> during the transition from a first state to a second state; wherein “N” indicates that no additional data is needed for the state transition; “L” indicates that the CPU <b>305</b> uses transition logic to determine the adjustments to the ankle device <b>304</b> during the state transition; and “I” indicates the CPU receives data from an interface (e.g., interface module <b>308</b>, external user interface, electronic interface or the like). Transition logic usable with embodiments of the invention may be developed by one with ordinary skill in the relevant art. Examples of transition logic used in similar systems and methods to embodiments of the present invention are disclosed in U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/572,996, entitled “CONTROL SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR A PROSTHETIC KNEE,” filed May 19, 2004, and U.S. application Ser.

    <p num="p-0123">In one embodiment, the above described states in TABLE 1 are predefined states of the ankle device <b>304</b>. For example, the “OFF” state may indicate that the functions of the ankle device <b>304</b> and the actuator <b>316</b> are in an off or suspend mode. The “HEEL_HEIGHT_CAL” state relates to the measuring of a heel height from a static sensor angle such as, for example, when the ankle device <b>304</b> is not in motion. The “SENSOR_CAL” state relates to surface angle calibration when the user is walking on a level surface. The “NEUTRAL” state relates to when the ankle device <b>304</b> is locked in a substantially fixed position. The “WALK” state relates to when the user is walking, such as on a level or sloped surface. “The “STAIRS_UP” and “STAIRS_DOWN” states relate to when the user is walking, respectively, up and down stairs. The “RELAX” state relates to when the user is in a relaxed position. For example, in one embodiment, the “RELAX” state relates to when a user is in a sitting position with the limb having the ankle device <b>304</b> crossed over the other limb. In such an embodiment, the control system <b>300</b> may cause the ankle device <b>304</b> to move into a maximum plantarflexion position to mimic, for example, the natural position and/or look of a healthy foot. The “PANTS” state relates to when a user is putting on pants, trousers, shorts or the like. In such a state, the control system <b>300</b> may, in one embodiment, cause the ankle device <b>304</b> to move into a maximum plantarflexion position to facilitate putting the clothing on over the ankle device <b>304</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0124">In other embodiments of the invention, other states are usable with the ankle device <b>304</b> in place of, or in combination with, the states identified in TABLE 1. For example, states may be defined that correspond to lying down, cycling, climbing a ladder or the like. Furthermore, in controlling the state transitions, the CPU <b>305</b> and/or control system <b>300</b> may process or derive data from sources other than those listed in TABLE 1.</p>
    <p num="p-0125">In other embodiments, the CPU <b>305</b> may perform a variety of other functions. For example, the CPU <b>305</b> may use information received from the sensor module <b>302</b> to detect stumbling by the user. The CPU <b>305</b> may function as a manager of communication between the components of the control system <b>300</b>. For example, the CPU <b>305</b> may act as the master device for a communication bus between multiple components of the control system <b>300</b>. As illustrated, in one embodiment, the CPU <b>305</b> communicates with the power module <b>318</b>. For example, the CPU <b>305</b> may provide power distribution and/or conversion to the other components of the control system <b>300</b> and may also monitor battery power or battery life. In addition, the CPU <b>305</b> may function so as to temporarily suspend or decrease power to the control system <b>300</b> when a user is in a sitting or a standing position. Such control provides for energy conservation during periods of decreased use. The CPU <b>305</b> may also process error handling, such as when communication fails between components, an unrecognized signal or waveform is received from the sensor module <b>302</b>, or when the feedback from the control drive module <b>310</b> or the ankle device <b>304</b> causes an error or appears corrupt.</p>
    <p num="p-0126">In yet other embodiments of the invention, the CPU <b>305</b> uses or computes a security factor when analyzing information from the sensor module <b>302</b> and/or sending commands to the control drive module <b>310</b>. For example, the security factor may include a range of values, wherein a higher value indicates a higher degree of certainty associated with a determined locomotion type of the user, and a lower security factor indicates a lower degree of certainty as to the locomotion type of the user. In one embodiment of the invention, adjustments are not made to the ankle device <b>304</b> unless the locomotion type of the user is recognized with a security factor above a predetermined threshold value.</p>
    <p num="p-0127">In one embodiment, the CPU <b>305</b> includes modules that comprise logic embodied in hardware or firmware, or that comprise a collection of software instructions written in a programming language, such as, for example C++. A software module may be compiled and linked into an executable program, installed in a dynamic link library, or may be written in an interpretive language such as BASIC. It will be appreciated that software modules may be callable from other modules or from themselves, and/or may be invoked in response to detected events or interrupts. Software instructions may be embedded in firmware, such as an EPROM or EEPROM. It will be further appreciated that hardware modules may be comprised of connected logic units, such as gates and flip-flops, and/or may be comprised of programmable units, such as programmable gate arrays or processors.</p>
    <p num="p-0128"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> further depicts CPU <b>305</b> including a memory <b>306</b> for storing instructions and/or data. For example, the memory <b>306</b> may store one or more of the following types of data or instructions: an error log for the other components of the control system <b>300</b>; information regarding gait patterns or curves; information regarding past activity of the user (e.g., number of steps); control parameters and set points; information regarding software debugging or upgrading; preprogrammed algorithms for basic movements of the prosthetic or orthotic system; calibration values and parameters relating to the sensor module <b>302</b> or other components; instructions downloaded from an external device; combinations of the same or the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0129">The memory <b>306</b> may comprise any buffer, computing device, or system capable of storing computer instructions and/or data for access by another computing device or a computer processor. In one embodiment, the memory <b>306</b> is a cache that is part of the CPU <b>305</b>. In other embodiments of the invention, the memory <b>306</b> is separate from the CPU <b>305</b>.

    <p num="p-0143"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a table that depicts possible control signals that may be involved in adjusting the ankle angle of a prosthetic or orthotic device when a user is transitioning between different states, or types of locomotion, according to one embodiment of the invention. In particular, the states listed in a column <b>402</b> identify a first state of the user, and the states listed in a row <b>404</b> identify a second state of the user, or the state to which the user is transitioning. The remainder of the table identifies possible actions that may be taken by the prosthetic or orthotic device with respect to the ankle angle. “User set point” is the neutral, or default, value that may be set during shoe heel height adjustment. The angles specified are examples of changes to the ankle angle of the prosthetic or orthotic device. For example, when a user is transitioning from a “stance” state to an “ascending stairs” state, the ankle angle may be adjusted to the angle of the stairs, such as for example, −10 degrees (or 10 degrees dorsiflexion). Ankle angles given in the “Incline (up)” and “Decline” columns reflect threshold levels of ankle angle adjustment depending on the angle of the incline.</p>

    <p num="p-0146"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> depicts a graph that illustrates the interaction and relationship between the control of a prosthetic or orthotic leg and the measurements taken from a healthy, sound leg. In particular, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> depicts the movement of a prosthetic or orthotic leg and a healthy leg during one full stride of a user. For example, during approximately the first 60% of the stride, the graph shows the prosthetic or orthotic leg as being in a “stance” position or being planted on a surface, such as the ground. In one embodiment, during the beginning portion of the stance phase the ankle angle of the prosthetic or orthotic leg may decrease (dorsiflexion). Toward the end of the stance phase the ankle angle of the prosthetic or orthotic leg may then increase (plantarflexion) to facilitate natural stride movements. In other embodiments of the invention, the ankle angle of the prosthetic or orthotic leg is not actively adjusted during the stance phase. During a portion of this same period, up to approximately point 40%, the healthy leg may be in a swinging position, wherein the healthy leg is not in contact with the ground. Between the points of approximately 40% and 60%, both legs are in contact with the ground.</p>
    <p num="p-0147">From approximately point 60% to 100% (the end of the stride), the prosthetic or orthotic leg is in a swinging position, and the healthy leg is in contact with the ground. The graph in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows that the ankle angle of the prosthetic or orthotic leg is adjusted during the swing phase. This angle adjustment may be based on previous measurements of the healthy leg during the swing phase of the healthy leg. In one embodiment, during the beginning portion of the swing phase of the prosthetic or orthotic leg, the ankle angle of the prosthetic or orthotic leg may decrease. This allows, for example, a toe portion of the prosthetic or orthotic leg to clear stairs. Toward the latter portion of the swing phase of the prosthetic or orthotic leg, the ankle angle of the prosthetic or orthotic leg may then increase before contacting the ground. In other embodiments, the angle adjustment is based on readings taken by sensors on the prosthetic side.</p>
    <p num="p-0148">It is to be understood that <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is illustrative of the functioning of one embodiment of the invention under certain conditions.

    <p num="p-0156">The actuator <b>500</b> also comprises a first elongate member or rotor <b>530</b> with a body extending from a top end <b>530</b> <i>a </i>to a bottom end <b>530</b> <i>b </i>along a length <b>532</b>, and having a diameter <b>534</b>. In one embodiment, the length <b>532</b> is between about 25 mm and about 70 mm. In one embodiment, the diameter <b>534</b> is between about 12 mm and about 40 mm.

In the illustrated embodiment, the motor <b>580</b> is a stepper motor. However, other suitable motor types can be used. For example, the motor <b>580</b> can be a DC motor, a piezo-electric motor, a DC brushless motor, and a servo motor.</p>
    <p num="p-0165">As best shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the actuator also comprises an o-ring <b>590</b> and a roller bearing <b>600</b> disposed between the motor <b>580</b> and a cover portion <b>610</b> having a protruding portion <b>612</b>. The cover <b>610</b> preferably houses the motor <b>580</b> therein when the actuator <b>500</b> is fully assembled. A bellows <b>620</b> is preferably disposed adjacent a bottom end of the cover <b>610</b>. The bellows <b>620</b> advantageously inhibits the entry of foreign particles, such as dust and water, into contact with the motor <b>580</b> and a second elongate member <b>630</b> of the actuator <b>500</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0166">The second elongate member <b>630</b> extends along a length <b>632</b> and has a diameter <b>634</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the second elongate member <b>630</b> is a screw with threads <b>636</b> along a portion of the length <b>632</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the screw <b>630</b> has an attachment portion <b>638</b> at a bottom end thereof with an opening <b>638</b> <i>a </i>that extends therethrough along an axis X<b>2</b> generally orthogonal to the longitudinal axis Y of the actuator <b>500</b>. The opening <b>638</b> <i>a </i>is preferably sized to receive a fastener therethrough, such as a bolt, a screw or a pin. Accordingly, the attachment portion <b>638</b> can be fastened to, for example, the prosthetic foot unit <b>104</b>′ at the first attachment point <b>118</b>′.</p>
    <p num="p-0167">In one preferred embodiment, the threads <b>636</b> of the screw <b>630</b> are adapted to threadingly engage the threads <b>540</b> on the nut <b>530</b>. Preferably, the threads <b>636</b>, <b>540</b> on the screw <b>630</b> and the nut <b>530</b>, respectively, are designed to be on the boundary of a self-locking coupling. In one preferred embodiment, the threads <b>636</b>, <b>540</b> of the nut <b>530</b> and the screw <b>630</b>, respectively are trapezoidal threads. For example, the threads <b>636</b>, <b>540</b> can be ACME centralized threads with a working diameter of about 14 mm, a pitch of about 2 mm, and about two leads. However, any suitable thread type can be used. In one embodiment, the threads <b>636</b>, <b>540</b> are made of Aluminum Bronze and Stainless Steel. However, other suitable metals and alloys can be used. In one preferred embodiment, the threads <b>540</b> in the nut <b>530</b> are cut, while the threads <b>636</b> in the screw <b>630</b> and ground and coated with a coating, such as a permanent oil coating. Advantageously, the thread lengths in the nut <b>530</b> are configured to provide minimum friction during operation of the actuator <b>500</b>, while delivering optimum support and strength to the actuator <b>500</b>. However, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the threads <b>540</b>, <b>636</b> of the nut <b>530</b> and the screw <b>630</b> can have other configurations and be made of other materials to provide a desired performance characteristic. For example, the material and coating of the threads, as well as the pitch, working diameter, and number of leads can be varied to provide a different interface friction between the threads <b>636</b>, <b>540</b>. In one embodiment, the pitch and configuration of the threads <b>636</b>, <b>530</b> can be chosen so that a load applied (e.g., along the longitudinal axis Y) to the screw <b>630</b> and/or nut <b>530</b> assembly will not initiate a self-generated movement of the actuator <b>500</b>. That is, the pitch and configuration of the threads <b>636</b>, <b>530</b> generate a friction force therebetween that is large enough to inhibit the relative rotation of the nut <b>530</b> and the screw <b>630</b>. In another embodiment, the pitch and configuration of the threads <b>636</b>, <b>530</b> can be chosen so that a load applied to the screw <b>630</b> and/or nut <b>530</b> along the longitudinal axis Y will initiate a self-generated movement of the actuator <b>500</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0168">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the screw <b>630</b> preferably has a hollow portion <b>640</b> extending along a portion of the length <b>632</b>. Advantageously, the hollow portion <b>640</b> reduces the weight of the screw <b>630</b>, thereby reducing the weight of the actuator <b>500</b> as a whole. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, an adoption ring <b>650</b> is disposed about the screw <b>630</b>, wherein the ring <b>650</b> couples with the bottom end of the bellows <b>620</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0169">Advantageously, the actuator <b>500</b> has a compact assembly. As discussed above, the motor <b>580</b> is disposed about the rotor <b>530</b>, which is disposed about the elongate member or screw <b>630</b>. Accordingly, the actuator <b>500</b> takes up less space and can have a lower height than other designs. In one preferred embodiment, the actuator <b>500</b> has a height of between about 40 mm to about 70 mm in a collapsed configuration, and a height of between about 65 mm to about 130 mm in a fully extended configuration. Additionally, the hollow portion <b>640</b> of the screw <b>630</b> advantageously reduces the weight of the actuator <b>500</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0170">In operation, the actuator <b>500</b> advantageously minimizes friction between the stator or top unit <b>510</b> and the rotor or nut <b>530</b>. The ball bearing <b>522</b> disposed between the top unit <b>510</b> and the nut <b>530</b> inhibits the generation of a friction force between the top unit <b>510</b> and the nut <b>530</b>, thereby allowing the nut <b>530</b> to rotate generally freely relative to the top unit <b>510</b>. Additionally, the magnets <b>542</b> draw the nut <b>530</b> toward the top unit <b>510</b>, as discussed above. Such a magnetic force lifts the nut <b>530</b> from engagement with the inner flange <b>556</b> <i>a </i>of the retainer <b>550</b>, thereby inhibiting the generation of friction between the retainer <b>550</b> and the nut <b>530</b>, as further discussed below. In a preferred embodiment, the magnetic force is strong enough to lift the rotor <b>530</b> from engagement with the inner flange <b>556</b> <i>a </i>of the retainer in one desired phase of a gait cycle. In another embodiment, the magnetic force of the magnets <b>542</b> is strong enough to lift the rotor <b>530</b> from engagement with the inner flange <b>556</b> <i>a </i>of the retainer <b>550</b> in more than one desired phase of a gait cycle.</p>
    <p num="p-0171">The actuator <b>500</b> can also advantageously be selectively locked during a desired phase of a gait cycle. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the flange <b>536</b> of the rotor or nut <b>530</b> can engage the inner flange <b>556</b> <i>a </i>of the retainer <b>550</b>, generating a friction force between the rotor <b>530</b> and the retainer <b>550</b> to inhibit the rotation of the rotor <b>530</b>. Thus, the friction force that is generated is effectively a locking force that locks the actuator <b>500</b>. In one preferred embodiment, the flanges <b>536</b>, <b>556</b> <i>a </i>engage when the actuator <b>500</b> is in tension. Additionally, as discussed above, the interaction of the threads <b>636</b>, <b>540</b> of the screw <b>630</b> and the nut <b>530</b> can also generate a friction force to inhibit the rotation of the screw <b>630</b> and the nut <b>530</b> relative to each other. Thus, the interaction of the threads <b>636</b>, <b>540</b> also generates a locking force that contributes to the locking of the actuator <b>500</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0172">The operation of the actuator <b>500</b> during the operation of the lower limb prosthesis <b>100</b>′ by a user will now be described. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates a flow chart showing the different phases of a gait cycle <b>670</b> of the lower limb prosthesis <b>100</b>′ illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A-12C</figref>. In a first phase <b>672</b> of the gait cycle <b>670</b>, during heel strike of the foot unit <b>104</b>′, the actuator <b>500</b> is initially in a state of compression, wherein the flange <b>536</b> on the rotor <b>530</b> is displaced relative to the inner flange <b>556</b> <i>a </i>on the retainer <b>550</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0173">The state of compression in the first phase arises from the operating relationship between the lower limb member <b>102</b>′ and the prosthetic foot unit <b>104</b>′. During heel strike, a load is applied on the heel portion <b>104</b> <i>a</i>′ of the foot unit <b>104</b>′ (e.g., due to the weight or locomotion force of the user). Said load applies an upward force on the heel portion <b>104</b> <i>a</i>′ of the foot unit <b>104</b>′, causing the toe portion <b>104</b> <i>b</i>′ to move away from the lower limb member <b>102</b>′ by rotating about the main pivot axis of the pivot assembly <b>114</b>′, which in turn applies a compression force on the second elongate member <b>630</b> via the first attachment point <b>118</b>′. The compression force is transferred from the second elongate member <b>630</b> onto the rotor <b>530</b>, so that the flange <b>536</b> of the rotor <b>530</b> moves away from the inner flange <b>556</b> <i>a </i>of the retainer <b>550</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0174">In one preferred embodiment, the actuator <b>500</b> is not actuated during the first phase <b>672</b>. However, to inhibit the rotation of the rotor <b>530</b> relative to the second elongate member <b>630</b> during the first phase <b>672</b> due to the applied load, the pitch of the threads <b>540</b>, <b>636</b> between the rotor <b>530</b> and the second elongated member <b>630</b> advantageously generate an interface friction force between the threads <b>540</b>, <b>636</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0175">The lower limb prosthesis <b>100</b>′ transitions into a second phase <b>674</b> where the foot unit <b>104</b>′ is in a stance phase. During said transition, the actuator <b>500</b> transitions from a state of compression to a state of tension, so that a friction force is generated between the flange <b>536</b> of the rotor <b>530</b> and the inner flange <b>556</b> <i>a </i>of the retainer <b>550</b>, as discussed above.</p>
    <p num="p-0176">The state of tension in the stance phase is generated by the movement of the lower limb member <b>102</b>′ relative to the prosthetic foot member <b>104</b>′ as the prosthesis <b>100</b>′ transitions into the second phase <b>674</b>. As the prosthesis <b>100</b>′ moves through the second phase <b>674</b>, the locomotion of the user (e.g., due to forward movement) applies a load on the lower limb member <b>102</b>′, urging the lower limb member <b>102</b>′ toward the toe portion <b>104</b> <i>b</i>′ of the prosthetic foot unit <b>104</b>′, thus placing a load on the toe portion <b>104</b> <i>b</i>′. Said load causes a rear portion of the foot unit <b>104</b>′ to move downward, away from the lower limb member <b>102</b>′, which in turn applies a tension force on the second elongate member <b>630</b> via the first attachment point <b>118</b>′. The tension force is transferred from the second elongate member <b>630</b> onto the rotor <b>530</b>, so that the flange <b>536</b> of the rotor <b>530</b> moves toward, and into engagement with, the inner flange <b>556</b> <i>a </i>of the retainer <b>550</b>. As discussed above, said engagement between the flange <b>536</b> of the rotor <b>530</b> and the inner flange <b>556</b> <i>a </i>of the retainer <b>550</b> generates a friction force to inhibit the rotation of the rotor <b>530</b>. In one preferred embodiment, the friction force is high enough to act as a brake to prevent the rotation of the rotor <b>530</b>. Furthermore, in one preferred embodiment, the actuator <b>500</b> is not actuated during the second phase <b>674</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0177">In a third phase <b>676</b>, the foot unit <b>104</b>′ transitions from a stance phase to a toe-off phase. In toe-off, the toe portion <b>104</b> <i>b</i>′ continues to be under load, as in the second phase. Accordingly, the actuator remains substantially in a state of tension, so that the rotor <b>530</b> is inhibited from rotating, as discussed above. In one embodiment, the load on the toe portion <b>104</b> <i>b</i>′ is greater in the third phase than in the second phase of the gait cycle. In one preferred embodiment, the actuator <b>500</b> is not actuated during the third phase <b>676</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0178">In a fourth phase <b>678</b>, the prosthetic foot unit <b>104</b>′ is in a swing phase between toe-off and heel-strike, wherein the foot <b>104</b>′ is not in contact with a support surface. In the fourth phase <b>678</b>, the actuator <b>500</b> is in a compression position. As discussed above, while in compression the flange <b>536</b> on the rotor <b>530</b> is separated from the inner flange <b>556</b> <i>a </i>of the retainer <b>550</b>, thereby allowing the rotor <b>530</b> to rotate generally freely relative to the retainer <b>550</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0179">The state of compression during the swing phase arises from the operating relationship between the lower limb member <b>102</b>′ and the prosthetic foot unit <b>104</b>′. During the swing phase, a load is applied to the prosthetic foot unit <b>104</b>′ due to the configuration of the foot unit <b>104</b>′ (e.g., the weight of the foot unit <b>104</b>′), which pulls the toe portion <b>104</b> <i>b</i>′ downward, away from the lower limb member <b>102</b>′. The downward force on the toe portion <b>104</b> <i>b</i>′ in turn applies a compression force on the second elongate member <b>630</b> via the first attachment point <b>118</b>′. The compression force is transferred from the second elongate member <b>630</b> onto the rotor <b>530</b>, so that the flange <b>536</b> of the rotor <b>530</b> moves away from the inner flange <b>556</b> <i>a </i>of the retainer <b>550</b>. The rotor <b>530</b> is thus able to rotate generally freely relative to the retainer <b>550</b>. In one embodiment, the movement of the flange <b>536</b> of the rotor <b>530</b> away from the inner flange <b>556</b> <i>a </i>of the retainer <b>550</b> is facilitated by the magnets <b>542</b>, which draw the rotor <b>530</b> toward the top unit or stator <b>510</b> and away from the retainer <b>550</b>, thus inhibiting the generation of friction during the swing phase.</p>
    <p num="p-0180">In one preferred embodiment, the actuator <b>500</b> is actuated during the swing phase to adjust the angle between the lower limb member <b>102</b>′ and the prosthetic foot unit <b>104</b>′. Advantageously, the ball bearing <b>522</b> disposed between the stator <b>510</b> and the rotor <b>530</b> also inhibit the generation of friction between the rotor <b>530</b> and the retainer <b>550</b>. Therefore, the actuator <b>500</b> is actuated while under a light load, which advantageously reduces the wear and tear on the actuator <b>500</b>, providing for an extended operating life.</p>
    <p num="p-0181">As discussed above, in one embodiment the actuator <b>500</b> inhibits the rotation of the rotor <b>530</b> relative to the second elongate member <b>630</b> when in a state of tension. However, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that in another embodiment the actuator <b>500</b> can be operated to inhibit the rotation of the rotor <b>530</b> relative to the second elongate member <b>630</b> while in compression. Moreover, in another embodiment the actuator <b>500</b> can also be arranged so as to allow for the rotation of the rotor <b>530</b> relative to the second elongate member <b>630</b> when in a tension position. For example, in one embodiment the magnets <b>542</b> can generate a magnetic force sufficient to draw the rotor <b>530</b> away from the inner flange <b>556</b> <i>a </i>of the retainer <b>550</b> while the actuator <b>500</b> is in a state of tension. Additionally, as discussed above, the actuator <b>500</b> is actuated during the swing phase <b>678</b> of a gait cycle. However, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the actuator <b>500</b> can be actuated during more than one phase of a gait cycle.</p>
    <p num="p-0182">Though the operation of the actuator <b>500</b> is discussed above in relation to a lower limb prosthesis <b>100</b>′, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the actuator <b>500</b> can also be used with an orthotic device to adjust the angle of a first portion and a second portion of the orthotic device. Additionally, the actuator <b>500</b>, as described in the embodiments above, can advantageously be used to selectively lock the orthotic device during a desired phase of locomotion, as well as to minimize friction between the rotor <b>530</b> and the retainer <b>550</b> during the actuation of the actuator <b>500</b> to facilitate the operation of the orthotic device.</p>
    <p num="p-0183">In certain embodiments of the invention, a lower limb prosthesis or orthosis includes at least one sensing device coupled thereto and that is substantially isolated from negative external effects or loads. For example, in certain embodiments, the sensing device is capable of measuring angular movement of a prosthetic foot in a single direction while disregarding or filtering out movement and/or loads of the prosthetic foot in other directions.</p>
    <p num="p-0184">For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates a disassembled view of a lower limb prosthesis <b>700</b> having an ankle-motion-controlled foot unit. For ease of reference and depiction, certain components, such as certain bolts, washers, bearing plugs and the like, are not shown and described with reference to the illustrated prosthesis <b>700</b>. A skilled artisan would recognize however, from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> and the disclosure herein which components, or equivalents thereof, may be used with the depicted components of the illustrated prosthesis <b>700</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0185">In certain embodiments, the prosthesis <b>700</b> includes at least one sensor assembly that advantageously detects rotation of the foot unit about a single axis and substantially neglects axial and radial movement of the foot unit with respect to the axis. For example, such a sensor assembly may be coupled to and or located near an axis of rotation of the prosthesis <b>700</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0186">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the illustrated lower limb prosthesis <b>700</b> comprises a foot member <b>702</b> connectable by screws <b>703</b> to a heel member <b>704</b>. As shown, the foot member <b>702</b> and heel member <b>704</b> may comprise a foot unit, such as an LP VARIFLEX® prosthetic foot commercially available from Össur. In yet other embodiments, the foot member <b>702</b> and/or heel member <b>704</b> may take on other configurations, or the lower limb prosthesis <b>700</b> may operate without a heel member <b>704</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0187">As illustrated, the foot member <b>702</b> is configured to rotatably attach to a main frame <b>706</b>, or attachment member, about a main pivot pin <b>708</b> extending through a base part <b>710</b>. In certain embodiments, the main pivot pin <b>708</b> and the base part <b>710</b> form a pivot assembly that is configured to substantially mimic the natural motion of a healthy human ankle. For example, the main pivot pin <b>708</b> may allow for dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the foot member <b>702</b>, as is described in more detail previously with respect to the prosthesis <b>100</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0188">The prosthesis <b>700</b> further includes an actuator <b>712</b> operatively coupled to the foot member <b>702</b> through the base part <b>710</b>. In particular, the actuator <b>712</b> couples to a lower pin <b>714</b> that allows for rotation of a bottom portion of the actuator <b>712</b> with respect to the base part <b>710</b> secured to a top, rear portion of the foot member <b>702</b>. In certain embodiments, the actuator <b>712</b> is advantageously capable of adjusting at least one angle between the main frame <b>706</b> and the foot member <b>702</b>, such that the foot member <b>702</b> rotates about the main pivot pin <b>708</b> of the pivot assembly. In certain embodiments, the actuator <b>712</b> comprises any one of the various types of actuators disclosed herein and is capable of actively adjusting the angle between the main frame <b>706</b> and the foot member <b>702</b> based on one or more signals received from an electronic control system.</p>
    <p num="p-0189">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the lower limb prosthesis <b>700</b> optionally further includes a keypad <b>716</b> to receive user input and a rear cover <b>718</b> that partially covers the actuator <b>712</b>. The prosthesis <b>700</b> may also include other devices and/or couplings to facilitate attachment of the prosthesis <b>700</b> to a limb, such as a stump, of an amputee.</p>
    <p num="p-0190">The illustrated lower limb prosthesis <b>700</b> further includes a sensor assembly <b>720</b> configured to couple to and extend through the base part <b>710</b> of the pivot assembly. In certain embodiments, the sensor assembly <b>720</b> is configured to measure movement of at least one portion of the prosthesis <b>700</b> in at least one direction. In certain preferred embodiments, the sensor assembly <b>720</b> is configured and positioned to measure movement of a portion of the prosthesis <b>700</b> in a single direction.</p>
    <p num="p-0191">For example, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, at least a portion of the sensor assembly <b>720</b> is positioned within the main pivot pin <b>708</b> and extends along an axis (e.g., a pivot axis) substantially perpendicular to a longitudinal, or vertical, axis of the main frame <b>706</b>. The illustrated sensor assembly <b>720</b> is capable of detecting, or measuring, rotation of the foot member <b>702</b> about the axis of the main pivot pin <b>708</b>. Furthermore, in certain embodiments, the sensor assembly <b>720</b> is secured to the pivot assembly of the prosthesis <b>700</b> such that the sensor measurements are not affected by loads or forces in directions other than rotation about the main pivot pin <b>708</b>. For example, in certain embodiments, axial or radial movements with respect to the axis of the main pivot pin <b>708</b> do not affect the measurements of the sensor assembly <b>720</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0192"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> illustrates a disassembled view showing further details of the components of the sensor assembly <b>720</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. As shown, the sensor assembly <b>720</b> includes a displacement measurement sensor <b>722</b> coupled to an elongated bellow portion <b>724</b> through an extender portion <b>726</b>. In certain embodiments, relative rotation of the foot member <b>702</b> with respect to the main frame <b>706</b> is measured by the displacement measurement sensor <b>722</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0193">Measurements of such rotation may be performed by the sensor assembly <b>720</b> in several ways. In certain embodiments, the main pivot pin <b>708</b> is rigidly attached to the base part <b>710</b>, and the elongated bellow portion <b>724</b> is positioned at least partially within the main pivot pin <b>708</b>. In such embodiments, relative movement of the foot member <b>702</b> (and attached base part <b>710</b>) with respect to the main frame <b>706</b> causes relative rotation between the elongated bellow portion <b>724</b> (and attached extender portion <b>726</b>) with respect to the displacement measurement sensor <b>722</b>. For instance, rotation of the foot member <b>702</b> may cause rotation of the elongated bellow portion <b>724</b> with respect to the displacement measurement sensor <b>722</b>, which may be fixed with respect to the main frame <b>706</b>. In other embodiments, rotation of the foot member <b>702</b> may cause rotation of the displacement measurement sensor <b>722</b> with respect to the elongated bellow portion <b>722</b>, which may be fixed with respect to the main frame <b>706</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0194">In certain embodiments, the displacement measurement sensor <b>722</b> comprises a potentiometer, such as, for example, a linear or logarithmic potentiometer. In such embodiments, rotation of the elongated bellow portion <b>724</b> causes a corresponding rotation of the extender portion <b>726</b> and a rotatable input <b>727</b> of the potentiometer. In yet other embodiments, other types of displacement measurement sensors may be used, such as, for example, rotational position transducers, optical or mechanical encoders, combinations of the same or the like, to measure movement and/or rotation of a component of the prosthesis <b>700</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0195">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the elongated bellow portion <b>724</b> further includes a plurality of ridges <b>728</b> around an outside surface of the bellow portion <b>724</b>. In certain embodiments, the ridges <b>728</b> advantageously eliminate or substantially reduce the effects of axial (e.g., along the axis of the bellow portion <b>724</b>) and/or radial (e.g., a direction perpendicular to the axis of the bellow portion <b>724</b>) movements and/or loads on measurements by the displacement measurement sensor <b>722</b>. For instance, at least some of the ridges <b>728</b> may be located within a component housing at least a portion of the elongated bellow portion <b>724</b>. In certain preferred embodiments, such a component may include the main pivot pin <b>708</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. In such embodiments, the ridges <b>728</b> may advantageously isolate movement of the elongated bellow portion <b>724</b> to rotation about the axis of the elongated bellow portion <b>724</b> and the main pivot pin <b>708</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0196">In yet other embodiments, the elongated bellow portion <b>724</b> may include a plurality of grooves or other surface features that isolate movement of the elongated bellow portion <b>724</b> to a single direction. In yet other embodiments, the sensor assembly <b>720</b> may function without the extender portion <b>726</b> or the ridges <b>728</b>. For example, the sensor assembly <b>720</b> may include a flexible compression membrane that couples the displacement measurement sensor <b>722</b> to the main pivot pin <b>708</b> and that absorbs unwanted movement (e.g., axial and/or radial movement).</p>
    <p num="p-0197">Although the sensor assembly <b>720</b> has been described with reference to particular embodiments, other configurations for the sensor assembly <b>702</b> may be used with the prosthesis <b>700</b>. For example, the main pivot pin <b>708</b> may be rigidly attached to the main frame <b>706</b>. In such embodiments, either the displacement sensor <b>722</b> or the elongated bellow portion <b>724</b> may also be affixed to the main frame <b>706</b> such that relative movement of the foot member <b>702</b> with respect to the main frame <b>706</b> is detected by the displacement measurement sensor <b>722</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0198">In yet other embodiments of the invention, the prosthesis <b>700</b> may include other types of sensor assemblies usable to detect movement of at least one component of the prosthesis <b>700</b>. For example, the prosthesis <b>700</b> may comprise a ball joint assembly that has its movement constrained in at least one direction by geometric constraints surrounding the ball joint, which constraints may include, for example, one or more pins or flat surfaces that engage one or more surfaces of the ball joint. In yet other embodiments, the sensor assembly <b>720</b> may include a flexible material that is stiff against twisting forces but allows for longitudinal compression and/or radial movement.</p>
    <p num="p-0199">Furthermore, it will be understood that the sensor assembly and/or prosthesis <b>700</b> may advantageously used with a variety of motion-controlled prosthetic and/or orthotic devices, examples of which are described in more detail herein and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/056,344, filed on Feb. 11, 2005, and entitled “SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MOTION-CONTROLLED FOOT UNIT,” which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety and is to be considered a part of this specification.</p>
    <p num="p-0200">As mentioned above with reference to TABLE 1 and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, in some embodiments of the invention, there are certain defined states of the ankle device <b>304</b>. One of these states is the “RELAX” state. In one embodiment, when the sensor module <b>302</b> detects that the user has moved to a relaxed position, the control device <b>300</b> may initiate the “RELAX” state.</p>
    <p num="p-0201">In one embodiment of the invention, the sensor module <b>302</b> detects when the user has moved to a relaxed position, such as sitting, crossing legs, reclining, lying down, crawling, leaning, etc. The sensor module <b>302</b> may detect these relaxed positions by measuring combinations of vertical acceleration (from which it may determined, for example, whether the overall ankle device <b>304</b>, particularly the foot unit <b>104</b> (with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), is in a tilted position with respect to the ground, such as resting on the heel with legs outstretched in a sitting or lying down position), horizontal/lateral acceleration, and time. For instance, the sensor module <b>302</b> may comprise an accelerometer capable of measuring acceleration in the y-axis. In one embodiment, the measured vertical acceleration corresponds to the force of gravity. The accelerometer may be placed on the ankle device <b>304</b>. In one embodiment, the accelerometer may be placed on the lower limb member <b>102</b> (with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), though the accelerometer may be placed anywhere on the ankle device <b>304</b>. When placed on the lower limb member <b>102</b>, the accelerometer may be used to measure an angle of the lower limb member <b>102</b> relative to vertical, which may then be used to determine an angle of the overall ankle device relative to the ground. As the ankle device <b>304</b> rotates from the upright, vertical position, the corresponding force of gravity will vary relative to the degree of rotation. For instance, when the ankle device <b>304</b> is in an upright, vertical position, the accelerometer may measure the standard force of gravity, 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>. As the ankle device <b>304</b> rotates from the vertical position, the accelerometer may measure a fraction of the Earth's global force of gravity relative to the changing angle of the ankle device <b>304</b> with respect to the ground. Thus, a sensor module <b>302</b> configured to measure acceleration in the vertical plane may be used to determine the stationary angle of the ankle device <b>304</b> with respect to the ground. For example, the sensor module <b>302</b> may indicate that the ankle device <b>304</b> is tilted at an angle of 90° with respect to the ground. This might indicate, for example, that the user is lying completely flat on the back. Alternatively, the sensor module <b>302</b> may indicate that the ankle device <b>304</b> is at an angle of 45° with respect to the ground, indicating perhaps that the user is sitting down with legs outstretched in such a manner as to form a 45° angle with respect to the ground.</p>
    <p num="p-0202">In addition to the vertical acceleration, the sensor module <b>302</b> may also comprise an accelerometer configured to measure acceleration in the horizontal, or lateral, plane. This accelerometer may measure the ground acceleration of the ankle device <b>304</b> as the user moves in horizontal directions. Moreover, the control device <b>300</b> may also comprise a timer (not shown) that may be used to measure the amount of time during which the sensor module <b>302</b> detects certain conditions of acceleration.</p>
    <p num="p-0203">To detect certain relaxed positions, the control device <b>300</b> may be configured to monitor the measurements of acceleration by the sensor module <b>302</b> over a period of time. In one embodiment, a range of angles of the ankle device <b>304</b> compared to the ground is defined that indicates the movement of the user to a relaxed position. To enter into the “RELAX” state, the control device <b>300</b> may determine that the angle between the ankle device <b>304</b> and the ground, as detected by the sensor module <b>302</b>, is within the defined range. Additionally or alternatively, a range of lateral/horizontal acceleration of the ankle device <b>304</b> may be defined. To enter into the “RELAX” state, the control device <b>300</b> may determine that the lateral/horizontal acceleration of the ankle device <b>304</b>, as detected by the sensor module <b>302</b>, falls within the defined range. Additionally or alternatively, a range of time may be defined during which the above-mentioned conditions may be met. In other words, to enter the “RELAX” state, the control device <b>300</b> may determine that the ankle device, for a specified period of time, is at angle with respect to ground within the defined range and/or is accelerating within the defined range indicative of a user's movement to a relaxed position. Thus, an algorithm that triggers execution of the “RELAX” state might define the variables: start maximum acceleration delta (the upper limit of possible acceleration of the ankle device <b>304</b> that triggers the “RELAX” state), the start minimum angle (the lower limit of the angle of the ankle device <b>304</b> with respect to ground that triggers the “RELAX” state), the start maximum angle (the upper limit of the angle of the ankle device <b>304</b> with respect to ground that triggers the “RELAX” state), and start time (the amount of time that a combination of the other variables may be satisfied to trigger the “RELAX” state).</p>
    <p num="p-0204">In one embodiment, used for example when a user is sitting down, reclining or crawling, the start maximum acceleration delta may be about 1 m/s<sup>2</sup>, indicating a threshold such that movement artifacts from the user should be less than about 1 m/s<sup>2</sup>. Alternatively, the maximum acceleration delta may be between about 0.1 m/s<sup>2 </sup>and 50 m/s<sup>2</sup>. The start minimum angle of the foot member relative to the ground may be about 30 degrees, and the start maximum angle may be −90 degrees, for example, representing that a user is lying down on the stomach. Alternatively, the range of angles may be between about −90° and +90°, the latter representing, for example, that a user is lying down on the back. The start time may for example be about 1 second or more. When each of these variables is satisfied, the ankle device will move to a relaxed state, as described below.</p>
    <p num="p-0205">In other embodiments, the control device <b>300</b> may detect conditions indicative of a user's movement out of a relaxed position and may initiate an “EXIT” state. The determination of a user's movement out of a relaxed position may be similar to the determination of a user's movement into a relaxed position. Thus, an algorithm that triggers execution of the “EXIT” state might define the variables: end minimum acceleration delta (the lower limit of possible acceleration of the ankle device <b>304</b> that triggers the “EXIT” state), the end minimum angle (the lower limit of the angle of the ankle device <b>304</b> with respect to ground that triggers the “EXIT” state), and the end maximum angle (the upper limit of the angle of the ankle device <b>304</b> with respect to ground that triggers the “EXIT” state). In some embodiments, the “EXIT” state may be initiated regardless of whether the “RELAX” state is initiated first. Thus, the “EXIT” state may adjust the device for a preferred configuration for exiting a relaxed position, even if the relaxed position is never detected and/or the “RELAX” state is never initiated. For instance, the control device <b>300</b> may detect that the user is in a sitting position without causing the device to adjust to a particular “RELAX” state. It may be advantageous, however, to adjust the device to an “EXIT” state even though a “RELAX” state is not initiated. For example, the “EXIT” state may cause the device to be adjusted to a particular configuration that is advantageous when a user stands up from a sitting position, such as causing the device to dorsiflex in order to help shift the user's center of momentum to be over his/her feet to facilitate standing. This “EXIT” state may be advantageous regardless of whether the device ever initiated a corresponding “RELAX” state.</p>
    <p num="p-0206">In one embodiment, to execute the “EXIT” state, the end minimum acceleration delta may be about 25 m/s<sup>2</sup>, allowing the user to exit the “RELAX” state by moving the ankle device greater than about 25 m/s<sup>2</sup>, such as by kicking the ankle device to the ground. Alternatively, the end minimum acceleration delta may be between about 0.1 m/s<sup>2 </sup>and 50 m/s<sup>2</sup>. The “EXIT” state may also be defined by an angle of the ankle device relative to the ground being between an end minimum angle of about −80 degrees and an end maximum angle of 10 degrees. Alternatively, the range of angles may be between about −90° and 90°.</p>
    <p num="p-0207">In one embodiment, the “RELAX” state specifies a particular angle between the foot unit <b>104</b> and lower limb member <b>102</b> to which the ankle device <b>304</b> should be adjusted. For instance, when the control device <b>300</b> initiates the “RELAX” state, the control drive module <b>310</b> may cause the actuator <b>316</b> to adjust the ankle device <b>304</b>, for example, to a plantarflexion position of at least 10°, more preferably about 15°. (With respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a plantarflexion position of about 15° is when the lower limb prosthesis <b>100</b> is adjusted such that the angle between the foot unit <b>104</b> and the lower limb member <b>102</b> is about 15° more than the angle between the foot unit <b>104</b> and the lower limb member <b>102</b> in the neutral position. At the neutral position, there is 0° of plantarflexion and dorsiflexion. Generally, the “neutral position” is when the lower limb member <b>102</b> is vertical relative to a horizontal plane, such as the ground. This neutral position will translate to any range of actual ankle angle depending on the heel height of the foot unit <b>104</b>.) The plantarflexion of the ankle device <b>304</b> may mimic the natural plantarflexion of a human foot, may be functionally advantageous, may be aesthetically appealing, etc. Similarly, when the control device initiates the “EXIT” state, the control drive module <b>310</b> may cause the actuator <b>316</b> to adjust the ankle device <b>304</b>, for example, to a dorsiflexion position of at least 5°. In one embodiment, the range of angles may be between about 1° and 15° of dorsiflexion, and as discussed above, may be used either when the ankle is exiting from a “RELAX” state, a neutral position where there is 0° of plantarflexion and dorsiflexion, or any other desired configuration. (Again with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a dorsiflexion position of 10° is when the lower limb prosthesis <b>100</b> is adjusted such that the angle between the foot unit <b>104</b> and the lower limb member <b>102</b> is 10° less than the angle between the foot unit <b>104</b> and the lower limb member <b>102</b> in the neutral position.)</p>
    <p num="p-0208">In other embodiments, the “RELAX” state may specify a certain power mode, such as a low power mode, to which the control device <b>300</b> should automatically adjust. For instance, the control device <b>300</b> might instruct the power module <b>318</b> to enter a low power mode, such as a hibernation mode, when the control device <b>300</b> determines to initiate the “RELAX” state. Similarly, the “EXIT” state may specify another power mode, such as a normal power mode, to which the control device <b>300</b> should automatically adjust. In yet other embodiments, the “RELAX” state and the “EXIT” state may specify certain heel heights, to which the control device should automatically adjust. In still other embodiments, it may be advantageous not to initiate the “RELAX” state or “EXIT” state for a certain period of time after the conditions for initiating these states have been detected.</p>
    <p num="p-0209">In addition to defining certain states, some embodiments of the invention may define certain optimal adjustments for particular terrain variables. For instance, in some embodiments, there are optimal adjustments made while the user is ascending an incline or descending a decline. Thus, embodiments of the invention may define optimal adjustments for responding to changes in inclination and declination, such as adjusting the angle of the ankle device with respect to the ground. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> illustrate embodiments of the invention engaging an inclining slope and declining slope, respectively. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, angle alpha (α) indicates the relative slope of the incline. Similarly, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, angle alpha (α) indicates the relative slope of the decline. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the angle theta (θ) indicates the angle between the lower limb member <b>102</b> and the foot unit <b>104</b> of a lower limb prosthesis <b>100</b> having an ankle-motion-controlled foot. When the lower limb prosthesis <b>100</b> is in its neutral, unadjusted state, the angle theta (θ) may be described as the neutral angle, or the angle of the lower limb prosthesis <b>100</b> on level ground. As the user maneuvers on inclined or declined slopes, the lower limb prosthesis <b>100</b> adjusts itself to engage the ground by contracting, for inclines, and by expanding, for declines, the angle theta (θ) between the lower limb member <b>102</b> and the foot unit <b>104</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the lower limb prosthesis <b>100</b> has been adjusted such that the angle theta (θ) between the lower limb member <b>102</b> and the foot unit <b>104</b> increases or decreases a desired amount based on the angle alpha (α), which is the measurement of the relative slope. Thus, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, for instance, the angle theta (θ) reflects the neutral angle, measured when the lower limb prosthesis is on level ground, minus the degree of inclination, reflected by the angle alpha (α). Similarly, the angle theta (θ) in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> reflects the neutral angle plus the degree of declination. For some slopes, it may be desirable not to adjust the lower limb prosthesis <b>100</b> to reflect the entire degree of inclination/declination, or may even be desirable to adjust the lower limb prosthesis <b>100</b> to reflect more.</p>
    <p num="p-0210">Thus, in some embodiments, it is advantageous to adjust the angle of the foot unit <b>104</b> to the lower limb member <b>102</b> to account for the relative incline and/or decline of the terrain. For example, the angle may decrease by about 0 to 30 degrees when adjusting to an incline, or may increase by about 0 to 30 degrees when adjusting to a decline. When the user is on level ground and the lower limb member <b>102</b> is vertical with respect to the horizontal ground surface, the angle between the lower limb member <b>102</b> and the foot unit <b>104</b> is said to be the neutral angle, or the angle of the device in the neutral position. As described in more detail below, when the device detects that the user is maneuvering on an incline and/or decline, then the device may adjust the changing relative position of the foot unit <b>104</b> to the lower limb member <b>102</b> during the user's gait according to a response angle based on the detected degree of incline and/or decline. In a sense, the device defines an adjusted neutral angle relative to the incline and/or decline. In other words, when the lower limb member <b>102</b> is in the vertical position while the foot unit <b>104</b> flatly engages an inclined and/or declined surface, then the angle between the lower limb member <b>102</b> and the foot unit <b>104</b> may be defined as the adjusted neutral angle for the device with respect to the degree of incline and/or decline.</p>
    <p num="p-0211">Subsequent adjustments to the ankle angle between the lower limb member <b>102</b> and the foot unit <b>104</b> may be made relative to this adjusted neutral angle. In some embodiments, the adjustment may occur only during the swing phase, such that during stance, the angle of the ankle between the lower limb member <b>102</b> and the foot unit <b>104</b> remains substantially constant at the adjusted neutral angle. Alternatively, the adjustment relative to the adjusted neutral angle may occur during both swing and stance phases. As the user leaves the stance phase and the device moves through the air without contact to the ground, the device may be adjusted as described above relative to the adjusted neutral angle (such as described by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 11</figref>). In other embodiments, the adjustments may also occur during the stance phase, when the foot unit <b>104</b> at least partially engages the ground. In some embodiments, for example on an incline, the foot unit <b>104</b> may be adjusted relative to the lower limb member <b>102</b> so as to dorsiflex at the heel strike and midstance phase and then at toe off may be adjusted to a plantarflexion angle to provide natural push off. In other embodiments, for example on a decline, the foot unit <b>104</b> may be adjusted relative to the lower limb member <b>102</b> so as to plantarfex at the heel strike phase and then during late stance and toe off may be adjusted to a dorsiflexion angle to aid roll over. It will be appreciated that these adjustments made during stance may also be utilized when walking on level ground. It will be further appreciated that the adjustments described above for inclined surfaces may be used for declined surfaces, and vice versa.</p>
    <p num="p-0212">In some embodiments, the sensor module <b>302</b> (with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) may be configured to determine if the user is walking up an incline or down a decline. This may be accomplished via dynamic analysis that traces the path of the ankle device <b>304</b> in the vertical plane. In one embodiment, two acceleration sensors with two axes measure the relative position of the ankle device to ground (gravity) during the stance phase. In one embodiment, these sensors are located on the lower limb member <b>102</b> (with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In other embodiments, the sensors may be located in the soles of shoes, in foot covers, on braces, etc. By measuring the gait from heel strike to toe off and how the foot is lifted in swing, the relative angle of incline and decline may be measured. This is because a user's gait exhibits different characteristics when walking on an incline, on a decline, and on level ground. For instance, there is more toe function than heel strike during incline. Additionally, while walking on an incline, the user lifts the foot more than on level ground and shortens the swing of the gait. Other characteristics may be observed for gait patterns while walking on a decline. Based on an understanding of the differences in gait patterns, the measurements of acceleration may be used to determine the surface angle. Sensors capable of determining the surface angle are available from Dynastream Innovations, Inc. (Alberta, Canada). In some embodiments, the surface angle may be filtered by averaging a number of measurements, such as five measurements.</p>
    <p num="p-0213">In some embodiments, the surface angle (or the filtered surface angle) may be applied to a formula that yields an ankle response angle. The ankle response angle is the optimal angle by which the lower limb prosthesis <b>100</b> (with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) should be adjusted for the specified surface angle, thereby configuring the lower limb prosthesis <b>100</b> to an adjusted neutral angle. The ankle response angle may be measured with respect to level surface ground. By way of example, if the response angle is 10°, then lower limb prosthesis <b>100</b> should be adjusted such that the toe end of the foot member <b>104</b> is rotated 10° toward the lower limb member <b>102</b>, making a 10° angle between the foot member <b>104</b> and the ground, assuming that the lower limb member <b>102</b> remains fixed with respect to level ground. If the lower limb prosthesis <b>100</b> were adjusted 10° in response to the detection of an incline of 10°, then the foot unit <b>104</b> of the lower limb prosthesis <b>100</b> would completely engage the ground, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, for example. If, on the other hand, the response angle is −10°, then lower limb prosthesis <b>100</b> should be adjusted such that the toe end of the foot member <b>104</b> is rotated 10° away from the lower limb member <b>102</b>, making a −10° angle between the foot member and the ground, assuming that the lower limb member <b>102</b> remains fixed with respect to level ground. If the lower limb prosthesis <b>100</b> were adjusted −10° in response to the detection of a decline of 10°, then the foot unit <b>104</b> of the lower limb prosthesis <b>100</b> would completely engage the ground, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, for example.</p>
    <p num="p-0214">In one embodiment, the optimal ratio between the surface angle and the response angle for inclined slopes is 1:1. In another embodiment, the optimal ration between the surface angle and the response angle for declined slopes is nonlinear, and in one embodiment is given by the formula: y=−0.017x<sup>2</sup>+0.1501x, where y is the ankle response angle and x is the detected (and possibly filtered) surface angle. Other embodiments may result in the response angle for declined slopes being between about 10% and 100% of the measured surface angle, more preferably between about 10% and 50%. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> illustrates an x-y graph depicting above-defined ratios between surface angles and ankle response angles for inclines and declines, respectively. Thus, if it is detected that the surface angle of the incline is 5°, then the corresponding response angle is also 5°, representing a 1:1 ratio for inclined surfaces. For declined surfaces, however, the ankle response angles correspond to the above-identified formula. Thus, if it is detected that the surface angle of the decline is −10°, then the corresponding response angle is approximately −2.5°. According to the illustrated embodiment, the optimal response angle for declining surfaces is a fraction of the angle of decline. This result is intuitively understood. As a user walks down a decline, the momentum created by the pull of gravity causes the user to roll through the gait pattern, resulting in less need for the foot unit <b>104</b> to automatically rotate downward to engage the ground. While walking up inclines, however, it is desirable for the foot unit <b>104</b> to automatically engage the ground without forcing the user to roll over the unbent lower limb prosthesis <b>100</b>.</p>
