    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0004">The present invention is related to methods and apparatus for detecting the presence of a child seat, more particularly, to methods and apparatus for detecting the presence of a child seat, its orientation and/or position. The detected presence, orientation and/or position, of a child seat may be used to control or affect the operation of a vehicular system, such as an occupant protection or restraint device, e.g., an airbag system.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">The present invention relates generally to methods and arrangements for obtaining information about an occupying item in a vehicle or a part in the vehicle using a wave-detecting device which receives waves emanating from a reflector or resonator. The reflector or resonator is arranged in association with the vehicle or occupying item so that the emanating therefrom can be processed to provide information about the occupying item, such as its position, or information about the vehicle, such as the position of the seat when the resonator is placed in the seat.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0006">It is a problem in vehicles that children and infants are sometimes left alone, either intentionally or inadvertently, and the temperature in the vehicle rises. The child or infant is suffocated by the lack of oxygen in the vehicle. This same problem also arises for pets which are more often left alone in a hot vehicle without adequate ventilation.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">Another problem which has unfortunately arisen relates to the theft of vehicles. There have been incidents when a thief waits in a vehicle until the driver of the vehicle enters the vehicle and then forces the driver to provide the keys to the vehicle and exit the vehicle.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">As for additional background, in 1984, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation issued a requirement for frontal crash protection of automobile occupants. This regulation mandated “passive occupant restraints” for all passenger cars by 1992. A more recent regulation required both driver and passenger side airbags on all passenger cars and light trucks by 1998. In addition, the demand for airbags is constantly accelerating in both Europe and Japan and all vehicles produced in these areas and eventually worldwide will likely be equipped with airbags as standard equipment, if they do not include them already.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">Whereas thousands of lives have been saved by airbags, significant improvements can be made. As discussed in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,653,462 referenced above, and incorporated herein by reference, for a variety of reasons, vehicle occupants can be or get too close to the airbag before it deploys and can be seriously injured or killed upon deployment of the airbag.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">Also, a child in a rear facing child seat, which is placed on the right front passenger seat, is in danger of being seriously injured if the passenger airbag deploys. This has now become an industry-wide concern and the U.S. automobile industry is continually searching for an easy, economical solution, which will prevent the deployment of the passenger side airbag if a rear facing child seat is present. An improvement on the invention disclosed in the above-referenced patent, as will be disclosed in greater detail below, includes more sophisticated means to identify objects within the passenger compartment and will solve this problem.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">Initially, these systems will solve the out-of-position occupant and the rear facing child seat problems related to current airbag systems and prevent unneeded deployments when a seat is unoccupied. Airbags are now under development to protect rear seat occupants in vehicle crashes. A system is therefore needed to detect the presence of occupants, position, i.e., determine if they are out-of-position, and type, e.g., to identify the presence of a rear facing child seat in the rear seat. Current and future automobiles may have eight or more airbags as protection is sought for rear seat occupants and from side impacts. In addition to eliminating the disturbance of unnecessary airbag deployments, the cost of replacing these airbags will be excessive if they all deploy in an accident. The improvements described below minimize this cost by not deploying an airbag for a seat, which is not occupied by a human being. An occupying item of a seat may be a living occupant such as a human being or dog, another living organism such as a plant, or an inanimate object such as a box or bag of groceries.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">A device to monitor the vehicle interior and identify its contents is needed to solve these and many other problems. For example, once a Vehicle Interior Identification and Monitoring System (VIMS) for identifying and monitoring the contents of a vehicle is in place, many other products become possible including the following:</p>
    <p num="p-0013">Inflators and control systems now exist which will adjust the amount of gas flowing into and/or out of the airbag to account for the size and position of the occupant and for the severity of the accident. The vehicle identification and monitoring system of this invention will control such systems based on the presence and position of vehicle occupants or the presence, position and orientation of an occupied child seat.</p>
    <p num="p-0014">Side impact airbag systems began appearing on 1995 vehicles. The danger of deployment-induced injuries will exist for side impact airbags as they now do for frontal impact airbags. A child with his head against the airbag is such an example. The system of this invention will minimize such injuries.</p>
    <p num="p-0015">Vehicles can be provided with a standard cellular phone as well as the Global Positioning System (GPS), an automobile navigation or location system with an optional connection to a manned assistance facility, which is now available on at least one vehicle model. In the event of an accident, the phone may automatically call 911 for emergency assistance and report the exact position of the vehicle. If the vehicle also has a system as described below for monitoring each seat location, the number and perhaps the condition of the occupants could also be reported. In that way, the emergency service (EMS) would know what equipment and how many ambulances to send to the accident site. Moreover, a communication channel can be opened between the vehicle and a monitoring facility/emergency response facility or personnel to enable directions to be provided to the occupant(s) of the vehicle to assist in any necessary first aid prior to arrival of the emergency assistance personnel.</p>
    <p num="p-0016">Vehicle entertainment system engineers have stated that the quality of the sound in the vehicle could be improved if the number, size and location of occupants and other objects were known. However, it is not believed that, prior to the instant invention, they have thought to determine the number, size and/or location of the occupants and use such determination in combination with the entertainment system. Indeed, this information can be provided by the vehicle interior identification and monitoring system of this invention to thereby improve a vehicle's entertainment system.</p>
    <p num="p-0017">Similarly to the entertainment system, the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system (HVAC) could be improved if the number, attributes and location of vehicle occupants were known. This can be used to provide a climate control system tailored to each occupant, for example, or the system can be turned off for certain seat locations if there are no occupants present at those locations.</p>
    <p num="p-0018">In some cases, the position of a particular part of the occupant is of interest such as: (a) his hand or arm and whether it is in the path of a closing window so that the motion of the window needs to be stopped; (b) the position of the shoulder so that the seat belt anchorage point can be adjusted for the best protection of the occupant; or, (c) the position of the rear of the occupants head so that the headrest can be adjusted to minimize whiplash injuries in rear impacts.</p>
    <p num="p-0019">The above applications illustrate the wide range of opportunities, which become available if the identity and location of various objects and occupants, and some of their parts, within the vehicle were known. Once the system is operational, it would be logical for the system to also incorporate the airbag electronic sensor and diagnostics system (SDM) since it needs to interface with SDM anyway and since they could share computer capabilities which will result in a significant cost saving to the auto manufacturer. For the same reasons, it would be logical for VIMS to include the side impact sensor and diagnostic system. As the VIMS improves to where such things as the exact location of the occupants ears and eyes can be determined, even more significant improvements to the entertainment system become possible through the use of noise canceling sound, and the rear view mirror can be automatically adjusted for the driver's eye location. Another example involves the monitoring of the driver's behavior over time which can be used to warn a driver if he or she is falling asleep, or to stop the vehicle if the driver loses the capacity to control it.</p>
    <p num="p-0020">Using an advanced VIMS, as explained below, the position of the driver's eyes can be accurately determined and portions of the windshield can be selectively darkened to eliminate the glare from the sun or oncoming vehicle headlights. This system uses electro-chromic glass, a liquid crystal device, or other appropriate technology, and detectors to detect the direction of the offending light source. In addition to eliminating the glare, the sun visor can now also be eliminated.</p>
    <p num="p-0021">The present invention adds more sophisticated pattern recognition capabilities such as fuzzy logic systems, neural network systems or other pattern recognition computer based algorithms to the occupant position measurement system disclosed in the above referenced patents and/or patent applications and greatly extends the areas of application of this technology. An example of such a pattern recognition system using neural networks using sonar is discussed in two papers by Gorman, R. P. and Sejnowski, T. J. “Analysis of Hidden Units in a Layered Network Trained to Classify Sonar Targets”, <i>Neural Networks</i>, Vol. 1. pp. 75-89, 1988, and “Learned Classification of Sonar Targets Using a Massively Parallel Network”, IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, Vol. 36, No. 7, July 1988.</p>

    <p num="p-0024">“Pattern recognition” as used herein will generally mean any system which processes a signal that is generated by an object, or is modified by interacting with an object, in order to determine which one of a set of classes that the object belongs to. Such a system might determine only that the object is or is not a member of one specified class, or it might attempt to assign the object to one of a larger set of specified classes, or find that it is not a member of any of the classes in the set. The signals processed are generally electrical signals coming from transducers which are sensitive to either acoustic or electromagnetic radiation and if electromagnetic, they can be either visible light, infrared, ultraviolet, radar or other part of the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
    <p num="p-0025">“To identify” as used herein will generally mean to determine that the object belongs to a particular set or class. The class may be one containing all rear facing child seats, one containing all human occupants, all human occupants not sitting in a rear facing child seat, or all humans in a certain height or weight range depending on the purpose of the system. In the case where a particular person is to be recognized, the set or class will contain only a single element, the person to be recognized.</p>
    <p num="p-0026">Some Examples Follow:</p>
    <p num="p-0027">In a passive infrared system a detector receives infrared radiation from an object in its field of view, in this case the vehicle occupant, and determines the temperature of the occupant based on the infrared radiation. The VIMS can then respond to the temperature of the occupant, which can either be a child in a rear facing child seat or a normally seated occupant, to control some other system. This technology could provide input data to a pattern recognition system but it has limitations related to temperature. The sensing of the child could pose a problem if the child is covered with blankets. It also might not be possible to differentiate between a rear facing child seat and a forward facing child seat. In all cases, the technology will fail to detect the occupant if the ambient temperature reaches body temperature as it does in hot climates. Nevertheless, for use in the control of the vehicle climate, for example, a passive infrared system that permits an accurate measurement of each occupant's temperature is useful.</p>
    <p num="p-0028">In a laser optical system an infrared laser beam is used to momentarily illuminate an object, occupant or child seat in the manner as described, and illustrated in FIG. 8, of U.S. Pat. No. 5,653,462 cross-referenced above. In some cases, a charge-coupled device (a type of TV camera also referred to as a CCD array) or a CMOS device is used to receive the reflected light. The laser can either be used in a scanning mode, or, through the use of a lens, a cone of light can be created which covers a large portion of the object. Also triangulation can be used in conjunction with an offset scanning laser to determine the range of the illuminated spot from the light detector. In each case, a pattern recognition system, as defined above, is used to identify and classify, and can be used to locate, the illuminated object and its constituent parts. This system provides the most information about the object and at a rapid data rate. Its main drawback is cost which is considerably above that of ultrasonic or passive infrared systems. As the cost of lasers comes down in the future, this system will become more competitive. Depending on the implementation of the system, there may be some concern for the safety of the occupant if the laser light can enter the occupant's eyes. This is minimized if the laser operates in the infrared spectrum.</p>
    <p num="p-0029">Radar systems have similar properties to the laser system discussed above. The wavelength of a particular radar system can limit the ability of the pattern recognition system to detect object features smaller than a certain size. Once again, however, there is some concern about the health effects of radar on children and other occupants. This concern is expressed in various reports available from the United States Food and Drug Administration Division of Devices. Naturally, electromagnetic waves from other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum could also be used such as, for example, those used with what are sometimes referred to as capacitive sensors, e.g., as described in U.S. patents by Kithil et al. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,366,241, 5,602,734, 5,691,693, 5,802,479, 5,844,486 and 6,014,602 and by Jinno et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,948,031 which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <p num="p-0030">The ultrasonic system is the least expensive and potentially provides less information than the optical or radar systems due to the delays resulting from the speed of sound and due to the wave length which is considerably longer than the optical (including infrared) systems. The wavelength limits the detail, which can be seen by the system. In spite of these limitations, as shown below, ultrasonics can provide sufficient timely information to permit the position and velocity of an occupant to be accurately known and, when used with an appropriate pattern recognition system, it is capable of positively determining the presence of a rear facing child seat. One pattern recognition system which has been used to identify a rear facing child seat uses neural networks and is similar to that described in the above-referenced papers by Gorman et al.</p>
    <p num="p-0031">A focusing system, such as used on some camera systems, could be used to determine the initial position of an occupant but is too slow to monitor his position during a crash. This is a result of the mechanical motions required to operate the lens focusing system. By itself it cannot determine the presence of a rear facing child seat or of an occupant but when used with a charge-coupled device plus some infrared illumination for night vision, and an appropriate pattern recognition system, this becomes possible.</p>
    <p num="p-0032">From the above discussion, it can be seen that the addition of sophisticated pattern recognition means to any of the standard illumination and/or reception technologies for use in a motor vehicle permits the development of a host of new products, systems or capabilities heretofore not available and as described in more detail below.</p>
    <heading>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0033">This invention includes a system to sense the presence, position and type of an occupying item such as a child seat in a passenger compartment of a motor vehicle and more particularly, to identify and monitor the occupying items and their parts and other objects in the passenger compartment of a motor vehicle, such as an automobile or truck, by processing one or more signals received from the occupying items and their parts and other objects using one or more of a variety of pattern recognition techniques and illumination technologies. The received signal(s) may be a reflection of a transmitted signal, the reflection of some natural signal within the vehicle, or may be some signal emitted naturally by the object. Information obtained by the identification and monitoring system is then used to affect the operation of some other system in the vehicle.</p>
    <p num="p-0034">The invention also includes methods and arrangements for obtaining information about an object in a vehicle. This determination is used in various methods and arrangements for, e.g., controlling occupant protection devices in the event of a vehicle crash. The determination can also used in various methods and arrangements for, e.g., controlling heating and air-conditioning systems to optimize the comfort for any occupants, controlling an entertainment system as desired by the occupants, controlling a glare prevention device for the occupants, preventing accidents by a driver who is unable to safely drive the vehicle and enabling an effective and optimal response in the event of a crash (either oral directions to be communicated to the occupants or the dispatch of personnel to aid the occupants). Thus, one objective of the invention is to obtain information about occupancy of a vehicle and convey this information to remotely situated assistance personnel to optimize their response to a crash involving the vehicle and/or enable proper assistance to be rendered to the occupants after the crash.</p>
    <p num="p-0035">Principle objects and advantages of the claimed invention are:</p>
    <p num="p-0036">1. To recognize the presence of an object on a particular seat of a motor vehicle and to use this information to affect the operation of another vehicle system such as the entertainment system, airbag system, heating and air conditioning system, pedal adjustment system, mirror adjustment system, wireless data link system or cellular phone, among others.</p>
    <p num="p-0037">2. To recognize the presence of an object on a particular seat of a motor vehicle and then to determine his/her position and to use this position information to affect the operation of another vehicle system.</p>

    <p num="p-0043">In order to achieve objects of the invention, a control system for controlling an occupant restraint device effective for protection of an occupant of the seat comprises a receiving device arranged in the vehicle for obtaining information about contents of the seat and generating a signal based on any contents of the seat, a different signal being generated for different contents of the seat when such contents are present on the seat, an analysis unit such as a microprocessor coupled to the receiving device for analyzing the signal in order to determine whether the contents of the seat include a child seat, whether the contents of the seat include a child seat in a particular orientation and/or whether the contents of the seat include a child seat in a particular position, and a deployment unit coupled to the analysis unit for controlling deployment of the occupant restraint device based on the determination by the analysis unit.</p>
    <p num="p-0044">The analysis unit can be programmed to determine whether the contents of the seat include a child seat in a rear-facing position, in a forward-facing position, a rear-facing child seat in an improper orientation, a forward-facing child seat in an improper orientation, and the position of the child seat relative to one or more of the occupant restraint devices.</p>
    <p num="p-0045">The receiving device can include a wave transmitter for transmitting waves toward the seat, a wave receiver arranged relative to the wave transmitter for receiving waves reflected from the seat and a processor coupled to the wave receiver for generating the different signal for the different contents of the seat based on the received waves reflected from the seat. The wave receiver can comprise multiple wave receivers spaced apart from one another with the processor being programmed to process the reflected waves from each receiver in order to create respective signals characteristic of the contents of the seat based on the reflected waves. In this case, the analysis unit preferably categorizes the signals using for example a pattern recognition algorithm for recognizing and thus identifying the contents of the seat by processing the signals based on the reflected waves from the contents of the seat into a categorization of the signals characteristic of the contents of the seat.</p>
    <p num="p-0046">A system for obtaining information about an object in the vehicle comprises at least one resonator arranged in association with the object and which emits an energy signal upon receipt of a signal at an excitation frequency, a transmitter for transmitting signals at least at the excitation frequency of each resonator, an energy signal detector device for detecting the energy signal emitted by the resonator(s) upon receipt of the signal at the excitation frequency and a processor coupled to the detector device for obtaining information about the object upon analysis of the energy signal detected by the detector device. The information obtained about the object may be a distance between each resonator and the detector device or an indication of the position of the seat.</p>
    <p num="p-0047">The resonator may comprise a tuned resonator including an acoustic cavity or a vibrating mechanical element. When multiple resonators are used, each resonator is preferably designed to emit an energy signal upon receipt of a signal at a different excitation frequency.</p>
    <p num="p-0048">If the object is a seatbelt, the information obtained about the seatbelt may be an indication of whether the seatbelt is in use and/or an indication of the position of the seatbelt.</p>
    <p num="p-0049">If the object is a child seat, the information obtained about the child seat may be an indication of the orientation of the child seat and/or an indication of the position of the child seat.</p>
    <p num="p-0050">If the object is a window of the vehicle, the information obtained about the window may be an indication of whether the window is open or closed.</p>
    <p num="p-0051">If the object is a door, the resonator is arranged in a surface facing the door such that closure of the door prevents emission of the energy signal therefrom, in which case, the information obtained about the door is an indication of whether the door is open or closed.</p>
    <p num="p-0052">Principle objects and advantages of other disclosed inventions that can be used in conjunction with the claimed invention are:</p>

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p num="p-0129">Referring to the accompanying drawings wherein the same reference numerals refer to the same or similar elements, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a side view, with parts cutaway and removed of a vehicle showing the passenger compartment containing a rear facing child seat <b>110</b> on a front passenger seat <b>120</b> and a preferred mounting location for a first embodiment of a vehicle interior monitoring system in accordance with the invention. The interior monitoring system is capable of detecting the presence of an occupant and the rear facing child seat <b>110</b>. In this embodiment, three transducers <b>131</b>, <b>132</b> and <b>133</b> are used, although any number of wave-transmitting transducers or radiation-receiving receivers may be used. Such transducers or receivers may be of the type which emit or receive a continuous signal, a time varying signal or a spacial varying signal such as in a scanning system. One particular type of radiation-receiving receiver for use in the invention is a receiver capable of receiving electromagnetic waves. In an embodiment wherein ultrasonic energy is used, transducer <b>132</b> transmits ultrasonic energy toward the front passenger seat, which is modified, in this case by the occupying item of the passenger seat, i.e., the rear facing child seat <b>110</b>, and the modified waves are received by the transducers <b>131</b> and <b>133</b>. Modification of the ultrasonic energy may constitute reflection of the ultrasonic energy as the ultrasonic energy is reflected back by the occupying item of the seat. The waves received by transducers <b>131</b> and <b>133</b> vary with time depending on the shape of the object occupying the passenger seat, in this case the rear facing child seat <b>110</b>. Each object will reflect back waves having a different pattern. Also, the pattern of waves received by transducer <b>131</b> will differ slightly from the pattern received by transducer <b>133</b> in view of its different mounting location. In some systems, this difference permits the determination of location of the reflecting surface (i.e., the rear facing child seat <b>110</b>) through triangulation. Through the use of two transducers <b>131</b>,<b>133</b>, a sort of stereographic image is received by the two transducers and recorded for analysis by processor <b>101</b>, which is coupled to the transducers <b>131</b>,<b>132</b>,<b>133</b>. This image will differ for each object that is placed on the vehicle seat and it will also change for each position of a particular object and for each position of the vehicle seat. Elements <b>131</b>,<b>132</b>,<b>133</b>, although described as transducers, are representative of any type of component used in a wave-based analysis technique, including, e.g., a transmitter and a capacitor plate.</p>
    <p num="p-0130">The “image” recorded from each ultrasonic transducer/receiver, for ultrasonic systems, is actually a time series of digitized data of the amplitude of the received signal versus time. Since there are two receivers, two time series are obtained which are processed by the processor <b>101</b>. The processor <b>101</b> may include electronic circuitry and associated, embedded software. Processor <b>101</b> constitutes one form of generating means in accordance with the invention which generates information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment based on the waves received by the transducers <b>131</b>,<b>132</b>,<b>133</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0131">When different objects are placed on the front passenger seat, the two images from transducers <b>131</b>,<b>133</b> are different but there are also similarities between all images of rear facing child seats, for example, regardless of where on the vehicle seat it is placed and regardless of what company manufactured the child seat. Alternately, there will be similarities between all images of people sitting on the seat regardless of what they are wearing, their age or size. The problem is to find the “rules” which differentiate the images of one type of object from the images of other types of objects, e.g., which differentiate the occupant images from the rear facing child seat images. The similarities of these images for various child seats are frequently not obvious to a person looking at plots of the time series and thus computer algorithms are developed to sort out the various patterns. For a more detailed discussion of pattern recognition see U.S. Pat. No. 5,943,295 to Varga et. al., which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <p num="p-0132">The determination of these rules is central to the pattern recognition techniques used in this invention. In general, three approaches have been useful, artificial intelligence, fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks (although additional types of pattern recognition techniques may also be used, such as sensor fusion). In some implementations of this invention, such as the determination that there is an object in the path of a closing window as described below, the rules are sufficiently obvious that a trained researcher can look at the returned acoustic signals and devise a simple algorithm to make the required determinations. In others, such as the determination of the presence of a rear facing child seat or of an occupant, artificial neural networks are used to determine the rules. One such set of neural network software for determining the pattern recognition rules is available from the NeuralWare Corporation of Pittsburgh, Pa.</p>
    <p num="p-0133">The system used in a preferred implementation of this invention for the determination of the presence of a rear facing child seat, of an occupant or of an empty seat is the artificial neural network. In this case, the network operates on the two returned signals as sensed by transducers <b>131</b> and <b>133</b>. Through a training session, the system is taught to differentiate between the three cases. This is done by conducting a large number of experiments where all possible child seats are placed in all possible orientations on the front passenger seat. Similarly, a sufficiently large number of experiments are run with human occupants and with boxes, bags of groceries and other objects (both inanimate and animate). Sometimes as many as 1,000,000 such experiments are run before the neural network is sufficiently trained so that it can differentiate among the three cases and output the correct decision with a very high probability. Of course, it must be realized that a neural network can also be trained to differentiate among additional cases, e.g., a forward facing child seat.</p>
    <p num="p-0134">Once the network is determined, it is possible to examine the result using tools supplied by NeuralWare, for example, to determine the rules that were finally arrived at by the trial and error techniques. In that case, the rules can then be programmed into a microprocessor resulting in a fuzzy logic or other rule based system. Alternately, a neural computer can be used to implement the net directly. In either case, the implementation can be carried out by those skilled in the art of pattern recognition. If a microprocessor is used, a memory device is also required to store the data from the analog to digital converters that digitize the data from the receiving transducers. On the other hand, if a neural network computer is used, the analog signal can be fed directly from the transducers to the neural network input nodes and an intermediate memory is not required. Memory of some type is needed to store the computer programs in the case of the microprocessor system and if the neural computer is used for more than one task, a memory is needed to store the network specific values associated with each task.</p>
    <p num="p-0135">In the embodiment wherein electromagnetic energy is used, it is to be appreciated that any portion of the electromagnetic signals that impinges upon a body portion of the occupant is at least partially absorbed by the body portion. Sometimes, this is due to the facts that the human body is composed primarily of water, and that electromagnetic energy is readily absorbed by water. The amount of electromagnetic signal absorption is related to the frequency of the signal, and size or bulk of the body portion that the signal impinges upon. For example, a torso of a human body tends to absorb a greater percentage of electromagnetic energy as compared to a hand of a human body for some frequencies.</p>
    <p num="p-0136">Thus, when electromagnetic waves or energy signals are transmitted by a transmitter, the returning waves received by a receiver provide an indication of the absorption of the electromagnetic energy. That is, absorption of electromagnetic energy will vary depending on the presence or absence of a human occupant, the occupant's size, bulk, etc., so that different signals will be received relating to the degree or extent of absorption by the occupying item on the seat. The receiver will produce a signal representative of the returned waves or energy signals which will thus constitute an absorption signal as it corresponds to the absorption of electromagnetic energy by the occupying item in the seat.</p>
    <p num="p-0137">An alternate system is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which is a side view showing schematically the interface between the vehicle interior monitoring system of this invention and the vehicle cellular communication system. In this view, an adult occupant <b>210</b> is shown sitting on the front passenger seat <b>220</b> and two transducers <b>231</b> and <b>232</b> are used to determine the presence (or absence) of the occupant on that seat <b>220</b>. One of the transducers <b>232</b> in this case acts as both a transmitter and receiver while transducer <b>231</b> acts only as a receiver. Alternately, transducer <b>231</b> could serve as both a transmitter and receiver or the transmitting function could be alternated between the two devices. Also, in many cases more that two transmitters and receivers are used and in still other cases other types of sensors, such as weight, seatbelt, heartbeat, motion and seat position sensors, are also used in combination with the radiation sensors. As was also the case in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the transducers <b>231</b> and <b>232</b> are attached to the vehicle buried in the A-pillar trim, where their presence is disguised, and are connected to processor <b>101</b> that may also hidden in the trim as shown (this being a non-limiting position for the processor <b>101</b>). The A-pillar is the roof support pillar that is closest to the front of the vehicle and which, in addition to supporting the roof, also supports the front windshield and the front door. Naturally, other mounting locations can also be used.</p>
    <p num="p-0138">The interface between the monitoring system and the cellular phone system is shown schematically by box <b>240</b> that outputs to an antenna <b>250</b>A. The transducers <b>231</b> and <b>232</b> in conjunction with the pattern recognition hardware and software, which is implemented in processor <b>101</b> and is packaged on a printed circuit board or flex circuit along with the transducers <b>231</b> and <b>232</b>, determine the presence of an occupant within a few seconds after the vehicle is started. Similar systems located to monitor the remaining seats in the vehicle, also determine the presence of occupants at the other seating locations and this result is stored in the computer memory which is part of each monitoring system processor <b>101</b>. In the event of an accident, the electronic system associated with the cellular phone system interrogates the various interior monitoring system memories and arrives at a count of the number of occupants in the vehicle, and in more sophisticated systems, even makes a determination as to whether each occupant was wearing a seatbelt and if he or she is moving after the accident. The phone system then automatically dials the EMS operator (such as 911) and the information obtained from the interior monitoring systems is forwarded so that a determination can be made as to the number of ambulances and other equipment to send to the accident site, Vehicles having this capability are now in service but are not believed to use any of the innovative interior monitoring systems described herein. Such vehicles will also have a system, such as the global positioning system, which permits the vehicle to determine its exact location and to forward this information to the EMS operator.</p>
    <p num="p-0139">Thus, in basic embodiments of the invention, wave or energy-receiving transducers are arranged in the vehicle at appropriate locations, trained if necessary depending on the particular embodiment, and function to determine whether a life form is present in the vehicle and if so, how many life forms are present. A determination can also be made using the transducers as to whether the life forms are humans, or more specifically, adults, child in child seas, etc. As noted above and below, this is possible using pattern recognition techniques. Moreover, the processor or processors associated with the transducers can be trained to determine the location of the life forms, either periodically or continuously or possibly only immediately before, during and after a crash. The location of the life forms can be as general or as specific as necessary depending on the system requirements, i.e., a determination can be made that a human is situated on the driver's seat in a normal position (general) or a determination can be made that a human is situated on the driver's seat and is leaning forward and/or to the side at a specific angle as well as the position of his or her extremities and head and chest (specific). The degree of detail is limited by several factors, including, e.g., the number and position of transducers and training of the pattern recognition algorithm.</p>
    <p num="p-0140">In addition to the use of transducers to determine the presence and location of occupants in a vehicle, other sensors could also be used. For example, a heartbeat sensor which determines the number and presence of heartbeats can also be arranged in the vehicle. Conventional heartbeat sensors can be adapted to differentiate between a heartbeat of an adult, a heartbeat of a child and a heartbeat of an animal. As its name implies, a heartbeat sensor detects a heartbeat, and the magnitude thereof, of a human occupant of the seat, if such a human occupant is present. The output of the heartbeat sensor is input to the processor of the interior monitoring system. One heartbeat sensor for use in the invention may be of the types as disclosed in McEwan (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,573,012 and 5,766,208 which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference). The heartbeat sensor can be positioned at any convenient position relative to the seats where occupancy is being monitored. A preferred location is within the vehicle seatback.</p>
    <p num="p-0141">Another type of sensor which is not believed to have been used in an interior monitoring system heretofore is a micropower impulse radar (MIR) sensor which determines motion of an occupant and thus can determine his or her heartbeat (as evidenced by motion of the chest). Such an MIR sensor could be arranged to detect motion in a particular area in which the occupant's chest would most likely be situated or could be coupled to an arrangement which determines the location of the occupant's chest and then adjusts the operational field of the MIR sensor based on the determined location of the occupant's chest. A motion sensor utilizing a micro-power impulse radar (MIR) system as disclosed, for example, in McEwan (U.S. Pat. No. 5,361,070, which is incorporated herein by reference), as well as many other patents by the same inventor. Motion sensing is accomplished by monitoring a particular range from the sensor as disclosed in that patent. MIR is one form of radar which has applicability to occupant sensing and can be mounted at various locations in the vehicle. It has an advantage over ultrasonic sensors in that data can be acquired at a higher speed and thus the motion of an occupant can be more easily tracked. The ability to obtain returns over the entire occupancy range is somewhat more difficult than with ultrasound resulting in a more expensive system overall. MIR has additional advantages in lack of sensitivity to temperature variation and has a comparable resolution to about 40 kHz ultrasound. Resolution comparable to higher frequency is feasible but has not been demonstrated. Additionally, multiple MIR sensors can be used when high speed tracking of the motion of an occupant during a crash is required since they can be individually pulsed without interfering with each through time division multiplexing.</p>
    <p num="p-0142">An alternative way to determine motion of the occupant(s) would be to monitor the weight distribution of the occupant whereby changes in weight distribution after an accident would be highly suggestive of movement of the occupant. A system for determining the weight distribution of the occupants could be integrated or otherwise arranged in the seats <b>120</b>,<b>220</b> of the vehicle and several patents and publications describe such systems.</p>
    <p num="p-0143">More generally, any sensor which determines the presence and health state of an occupant could also be integrated into the vehicle interior monitoring system in accordance with the invention. For example, a sensitive motion sensor can determine whether an occupant is breathing and a chemical sensor can determine the amount of carbon dioxide, or the concentration of carbon dioxide, in the air in the vehicle which can be correlated to the health state of the occupant(s). The motion sensor and chemical sensor can be designed to have a fixed operational field situated where the occupant's mouth is most likely to be located. In the alternative, the motion sensor and chemical sensor can be adjustable and adapted to adjust their operational field in conjunction with a determination by an occupant position and location sensor which would determine the location of specific parts of the occupant's body, e.g., his or her chest or mouth. Furthermore, an occupant position and location sensor can be used to determine the location of the occupant's eyes and determine whether the occupant is conscious, i.e., whether his or her eyes are open or closed or moving.</p>
    <p num="p-0144">The use of chemical sensors could also conceivably be used to detect whether there is blood present in the vehicle, e.g., after an accident. Additionally, microphones can detect whether there is noise in the vehicle caused by groaning, yelling, etc., and transmit any such noise through the cellular connection to a remote listening facility (such as operated by OnStar™).</p>
    <p num="p-0145"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows a schematic diagram of an embodiment of the invention including a system for determining the presence and health state of any occupants of the vehicle and a telecommunications link. This embodiment includes means for determining the presence of any occupants <b>10</b> which may take the form of a heartbeat sensor or motion sensor as described above and means for determining the health state of any occupants <b>12</b>. The latter means may be integrated into the means for determining the presence of any occupants, i.e., one and the same component, or separate therefrom. Further, means for determining the location, and optionally velocity, of the occupants or one or more parts thereof <b>14</b> are provided and may be any conventional occupant position sensor or preferably, one of the occupant position sensors as described herein (e.g., those utilizing waves or electromagnetic radiation) or as described in the current assignee's patents and patent applications referenced A processor <b>16</b> is coupled to the presence determining means <b>10</b>, the health state determining means <b>12</b> and the location determining means <b>14</b>. A communications unit <b>18</b> is coupled to the processor <b>16</b>. The processor <b>16</b> and/or communications unit <b>18</b> can also be coupled to microphones <b>20</b> distributed throughout the vehicle and include voice-processing circuitry to enable the occupant(s) to effect vocal control of the processor <b>16</b>, communications unit <b>18</b> or any coupled component or oral communications via the communications unit <b>18</b>. The processor <b>16</b> is also coupled to another vehicular system, component or subsystem <b>22</b> and can issue control commands to effect adjustment of the operating conditions of the system, component or subsystem. Such a system, component or subsystem can be the heating or air-conditioning system, the entertainment system, an occupant restraint device such as an airbag, a glare prevention system, etc. Also, a positioning system <b>24</b> could be coupled to the processor <b>16</b> and provides an indication of the absolute position of the vehicle, preferably using satellite-based positioning technology (e.g., a GPS receiver).</p>
    <p num="p-0146">In normal use (other than after a crash), the presence determining means <b>10</b> determine whether any human occupants are present, i.e., adults or children, and the location determining means <b>14</b> determine the occupant's location. The processor <b>16</b> receives signals representative of the presence of occupants and their location and determines whether the vehicular system, component or subsystem <b>22</b> can be modified to optimize its operation for the specific arrangement of occupants. For example, if the processor <b>16</b> determines that only the front seats in the vehicle are occupied, it could control the heating system to provide heat only through vents situated to provide heat for the front-seated occupants.</p>
    <p num="p-0147">Another possible vehicular system, component or subsystem is a navigational aid, i.e., a route display or map. In this case, the position of the vehicle as determined by the positioning system <b>24</b> is conveyed through processor <b>16</b> to the communications unit <b>18</b> to a remote facility and a map is transmitted from this facility to the vehicle to be displayed on the route display. If directions are needed, a request for the same could be entered into an input unit <b>26</b> associated with the processor <b>16</b> and transmitted to the facility. Data for the display map and/or vocal instructions could be transmitted from this facility to the vehicle.</p>
    <p num="p-0148">Moreover, using this embodiment, it is possible to remotely monitor the health state of the occupants in the vehicle and most importantly, the driver. The health state determining means <b>12</b> may be used to detect whether the driver's breathing is erratic or indicative of a state in which the driver is dozing off. The health state determining means <b>12</b> could also include a breath-analyzer to determine whether the driver's breath contains alcohol. In this case, the health state of the driver is relayed through the processor <b>16</b> and the communications unit <b>18</b> to the remote facility and appropriate action can be taken. For example, it would be possible to transmit a command to the vehicle to activate an alarm or illuminate a warning light or if the vehicle is equipped with an automatic guidance system and ignition shut-off, to cause the vehicle to come to a stop on the shoulder of the roadway or elsewhere out of the traffic stream. The alarm, warning light, automatic guidance system and ignition shut-off are thus particular vehicular components or subsystems represented by <b>22</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0149">In use after a crash, the presence determining means <b>10</b>, health state determining means <b>12</b> and location determining means <b>14</b> obtain readings from the passenger compartment and direct such readings to the processor <b>16</b>. The processor <b>16</b> analyzes the information and directs or controls the transmission of the information about the occupant(s) to a remote, manned facility. Such information would include the number and type of occupants, i.e., adults, children, infants, whether any of the occupants have stopped breathing or are breathing erratically, whether the occupants are conscious (as evidenced by, e.g., eye motion), whether blood is present (as detected by a chemical sensor) and whether the occupants are making noise. Moreover, the communications link through the communications unit <b>18</b> can be activated immediately after the crash to enable personnel at the remote facility to initiate communications with the vehicle.</p>
    <p num="p-0150">The control of the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) system alone would probably not justify the implementation of an interior monitoring system at least until the time comes when electronic heating and cooling systems replace the conventional systems now used. Nevertheless, if the monitoring system is present, it can be used to control the HVAC for a small increment in cost. The advantage of such a system is that since most vehicles contain only a single occupant, there is no need to direct heat or air conditioning to unoccupied seats. This permits the most rapid heating or cooling for the driver when the vehicle is first started and he is alone without heating or cooling unoccupied seats. Since the HVAC system does consume energy, an energy saving also results by only heating and cooling the driver when he is alone.</p>
    <p num="p-0151"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a side view of a vehicle passenger compartment showing schematically an interface <b>260</b> between the vehicle interior monitoring system of this invention and the vehicle heating and air conditioning system. In addition to the transducers <b>231</b> and <b>232</b>, which at least in this embodiment are preferably acoustic transducers, an infrared sensor <b>234</b> is also shown mounted in the A-pillar and is constructed and operated to monitor the temperature of the occupant. The output from each of the transducers is fed into processor <b>101</b> that is in turn connected to interface <b>260</b>. In this manner, the HVAC control is based on the occupant's temperature rather than that of the ambient air in the vehicle, as well as the determined presence of the occupant via transducers <b>231</b>,<b>232</b> as described above. This also permits each vehicle occupant to be independently monitored and the HVAC system to be adjusted for each occupant either based on a set temperature for all occupants or, alternately, each occupant could be permitted to set his own preferred temperature through adjusting a control knob shown schematically as <b>250</b> in FIG. <b>3</b>. Since the monitoring system is already installed in the vehicle with its own associated electronics including processor <b>101</b>, the infrared sensor can be added with little additional cost and can share the processing unit.</p>
    <p num="p-0152">Not only can this system be used for directing hot and cold air, but developments in the field of directing sound using hyper-sound (also referred to as hypersonic sound) now make it possible to accurately direct sound to the vicinity of the ears of an occupant so that only that occupant can hear the sound. The system of this invention can thus be used to find the proximate direction of the ears of the occupant for this purpose. Additional discussion of this aspect is set forth below with respect to FIG. <b>5</b>A.</p>
    <p num="p-0153">Hypersonic sound is described in detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,885,129 (Norris), U.S. Pat. No. 5,889,870 (Norris) and U.S. Pat. No. 6,016,351 (Raida et al.) and International Publication No. WO 00/18031 which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety to the extent the disclosure of these references is necessary. By practicing the techniques described in these patents and the publication, in some cases coupled with a mechanical or acoustical steering mechanism, sound can be directed to the location of the ears of a particular vehicle occupant in such a manner that the other occupants can barely hear the sound, if at all. This is particularly the case when the vehicle is operating at high speeds on the highway and a high level of “white” noise is present. In this manner, one occupant can be listening to the news while another is listening to an opera, for example. Naturally, white noise can also be added to the vehicle and generated by the hypersonic sound system if necessary when the vehicle is stopped or traveling in heavy traffic. Thus, several occupants of a vehicle can listen to different programming without the other occupants hearing that programming. This can be accomplished using hypersonic sound without requiring earphones.</p>
    <p num="p-0154">In principle, hypersonic sound utilizes the emission of inaudible ultrasonic frequencies that mix in air and result in the generation of new audio frequencies. A hypersonic sound system is a highly efficient converter of electrical energy to acoustical energy. Sound is created in air at any desired point which provides flexibility and allows manipulation of the perceived location of the source of the sound. Speaker enclosures are thus rendered dispensable. The dispersion of the mixing area of the ultrasonic frequencies and thus the area in which the new audio frequencies are audible can be controlled to provide a very narrow or wide area as desired.</p>
    <p num="p-0155">The audio mixing area generated by each set of two ultrasonic frequency generators in accordance with the invention could thus be directly in front of the ultrasonic frequency generators in which case the audio frequencies would travel from the mixing area in a narrow straight beam or cone to the occupant. Also, the mixing area could include only a single ear of an occupant (another mixing area being formed by ultrasonic frequencies generated by a set of two other ultrasonic frequency generators at the location of the other ear of the occupant with presumably but not definitely the same new audio frequencies) or be large enough to encompass the head and both ears of the occupant. If so desired, the mixing area could even be controlled to encompass the determined location of the cars of multiple occupants, e.g., occupants seated one behind the other or one next to another.</p>
    <p num="p-0156">The use of the vehicle interior monitoring system to control the deployment of an airbag is discussed in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,653,462 referenced above. In that case, the control is based on the use of a simple pattern recognition system to differentiate between the occupant and his extremities in order to provide an accurate determination of the position of the occupant relative to the airbag. If the occupant is sufficiently close to the airbag module that he is more likely to be injured by the deployment itself than by the accident, the deployment of the airbag is suppressed. This process is carried further by the interior monitoring system described herein in that the nature or identity of the object occupying the vehicle seat is used to contribute to the airbag deployment decision. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a side view illustrating schematically the interface between the vehicle interior monitoring system of this invention and the vehicle airbag system <b>270</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0157">In this embodiment, an ultrasonic transducer <b>232</b> transmits a burst of ultrasonic waves that travel to the occupant where they are reflected back to transducers or receptors/receivers <b>231</b> and <b>232</b>. The time period required for the waves to travel from the generator and return is used to determine the distance from the occupant to the airbag as described in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 5,653,462, i.e., and thus may also be used to determine the position or location of the occupant. In the case of this invention, however, the portion of the return signal, which represents the occupants' head or chest, has been determined based on pattern recognition techniques such as a neural network. The relative velocity of the occupant toward the airbag can then be determined, from successive position measurements, which permits a sufficiently accurate prediction of the time when the occupant would become proximate to the airbag. By comparing the occupant relative velocity to the integral of the crash deceleration pulse, a determination as to whether the occupant is being restrained by a seatbelt can also be made which then can affect the airbag deployment initiation decision. Alternately, the mere knowledge that the occupant has moved a distance which would not be possible if he were wearing a seatbelt gives information that he is not wearing one.</p>
    <p num="p-0158">A more detailed discussion of this process and of the advantages of the various technologies, such as acoustic or electromagnetic, can be found in SAE paper 0.940527, “Vehicle Occupant Position Sensing” by Breed et al, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety to the extent the disclosure of this paper is necessary. In this paper, it is demonstrated that the time delay required for acoustic waves to travel to the occupant and return does not prevent the use of acoustics for position measurement of occupants during the crash event. For position measurement and for many pattern recognition applications, ultrasonics is the preferred technology due to the lack of adverse health effects and the low cost of ultrasonic systems compared with either laser or radar. The main limiting feature of ultrasonics is the wavelength, which places a limitation on the size of features that can be discerned. Optical systems, for example, are required when the identification of particular individuals is required.</p>
    <p num="p-0159">It is well known among acoustics engineers that the quality of sound coming from an entertainment system can be substantially affected by the characteristics and contents of the space in which it operates and the surfaces surrounding that space. When an engineer is designing a system for an automobile he has a great deal of knowledge about that space and of the vehicle surfaces surrounding it. He has little knowledge of how many occupants are likely to be in the vehicle on a particular day, however, and therefore the system is a compromise. If the system knew the number and position of the vehicle occupants, and maybe even their size, then adjustments could be made in the system output and the sound quality improved. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, therefore, illustrates schematically the interface between the vehicle interior monitoring system of this invention, i.e., transducers <b>231</b>,<b>232</b> and processor <b>101</b> which operate as set forth above, and the vehicle entertainment system <b>280</b>. The particular design of the entertainment system that uses the information provided by the monitoring system can be determined by those skilled in the appropriate art. Perhaps in combination with this system, the quality of the sound system can be measured by the audio system itself either by using the speakers as receiving units also or through the use of special microphones. The quality of the sound can then be adjusted according to the vehicle occupancy and the reflectivity of the vehicle occupants. If, for example, certain frequencies are being reflected more that others, the audio amplifier can be adjusted to amplify those frequencies to a lesser amount that others.</p>
    <p num="p-0160">Vehicle entertainment system <b>280</b> may include means for generating and transmitting sound waves at the ears of the occupants, the position of which are detected by transducers <b>231</b>,<b>232</b> and processor <b>101</b>, as well as means for detecting the presence and direction of unwanted noise. In this manner, appropriate sound waves can be generated and transmitted to the occupant to cancel the unwanted noise and thereby optimize the comfort of the occupant, i.e., the reception of the desired sound from the entertainment system <b>280</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0161">More particularly, the entertainment system <b>280</b> includes sound generating components such as speakers, the output of which can be controlled to enable particular occupants to each listen to a specific musical selection. As such, each occupant can listen to different music, or multiple occupants can listen to the same music while other occupant(s) listen to different music. Control of the speakers to direct sound waves at a particular occupant, i.e., at the ears of the particular occupant located in any of the ways discussed herein, can be enabled by any known manner in the art, for example, speakers having an adjustable position and/or orientation or speakers producing directable sound waves. In this manner, once the occupants are located, the speakers are controlled to direct the sound waves at the occupant, or even more specifically, at the head or ears of the occupants.</p>
    <p num="p-0162"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows a schematic of a vehicle with four sound generating units <b>281</b>,<b>282</b>,<b>283</b>,<b>284</b> forming part of the entertainment system <b>280</b> of the vehicle which is coupled to the processor <b>101</b>. Sound generating unit <b>281</b> is located to provide sound to the driver. Sound generating unit <b>282</b> is located to provide sound for the front-seated passenger. Sound generating unit <b>283</b> is located to provide sound for the passenger in the rear seat behind the driver and sound generating unit <b>284</b> is located to provide sound for the passenger in the rear seat behind the front-seated passenger. A single sound-generating unit could be used to provide sound for multiple locations or multiple sound generating units could be used to provide sound for a single location.</p>
    <p num="p-0163">Sound generating units <b>281</b>,<b>282</b>,<b>283</b>,<b>284</b> operate independently and are activated independently so that, for example, when the rear seat is empty, sound generating units <b>283</b>,<b>284</b> are not operated. This constitutes control of the entertainment system based on, e g., the presence, number and position of the occupants. Further, each sound-generating unit <b>281</b>-<b>284</b> can generate different sounds so as to customize the audio reception for each occupant.</p>
    <p num="p-0164">Each sound generating units <b>281</b>,<b>282</b>,<b>283</b>,<b>284</b> may be constructed to utilize hypersonic sound to enable specific, desired sounds to be directed to each occupant independent of sound directed to another occupant. The construction of sound generating units utilizing hypersonic sound is described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,885,129, 5,889,870 and 6,016,351 mentioned above and incorporated by reference herein. In general, in hypersonic sound, ultrasonic waves are generated by a pair of ultrasonic frequency generators and mix after generation to create new audio frequencies. By appropriate positioning, orientation and/or control of the ultrasonic frequency generators, the new audio frequencies will be created in an area encompassing the head of the occupant intended to receive the new audio frequencies. Control of the sound generating units <b>281</b>-<b>284</b> is accomplished automatically upon a determination by the monitoring system of at least the position of any occupants</p>
    <p num="p-0165">Furthermore, multiple sound generating units or speakers can be provided for each sitting position and these sound generating units or speakers independently activated so that only those sound generating units or speakers which provide sound waves at the determined position of the ears of the occupant will be activated. In this case, there could be four speakers associated with each seat and only two speakers would be activated for, e.g., a small person whose ears are determined to be below the upper edge of the seat, whereas the other two would be activated for a large person whose ears are determined to be above the upper edge of the seat. All four could be activated for a medium size person. This type of control, i.e., control over which of a plurality of speakers are activated, would likely be most advantageous when the output direction of the speakers is fixed in position and provide sound waves only for a predetermined region of the passenger compartment.</p>
    <p num="p-0166">When the entertainment system comprises speakers which generate actual audio frequencies, the speakers can be controlled to provide different outputs for the speakers based on the occupancy of the seats. For example, using the identification methods disclosed herein, the identity of the occupants can be determined in association with each seating position and, by enabling such occupants to store music preferences, e.g., a radio station, the speakers associated with each seating position can be controlled to provide music from the respective radio station. The speakers could also be automatically directed or orientatable so that at least one speaker directs sound toward each occupant present in the vehicle. Speakers which cannot direct sound to an occupant would not be activated.</p>
    <p num="p-0167">Thus, one of the more remarkable advantages of the improved audio reception system and method disclosed herein is that by monitoring the position of the occupants, the entertainment system can be controlled without manual input to optimize audio reception by the occupants.</p>
    <p num="p-0168">The maximum acoustic frequency that is practical to use for acoustic imaging in the systems is about 40 to 160 kilohertz (kHz). The wavelength of a 50 kHz acoustic wave is about 0.6 cm which is too coarse to determine the fine features of a person's face, for example. It is well understood by those skilled in the art that features which are smaller than the wavelength of the irradiating radiation cannot be distinguished. Similarly the wavelength of common radar systems varies from about 0.9 cm (for 33,000 MHz K band) to 133 cm (for 225 MHz P band) which is also too coarse for person identification systems. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, therefore, the ultrasonic transducers of the previous designs are replaced by laser transducers <b>231</b> and <b>232</b> which are connected to a microprocessor <b>101</b>. In all other manners, the system operates the same. The design of the electronic circuits for this laser system is described in some detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,653,462 cross-referenced above and in particular <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> thereof and the corresponding description. In this case, a pattern recognition system such as a neural network system is employed and uses the demodulated signals from the receptors <b>231</b> and <b>232</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0169">The output of processor <b>101</b> of the monitoring system is shown connected schematically to a general interface <b>290</b> which can be the vehicle ignition enabling system; the entertainment system; the seat, mirror, suspension or other adjustment systems; or any other appropriate vehicle system.</p>
    <p num="p-0170">There are two preferred methods of implementing the vehicle interior monitoring system of this invention, a microprocessor system and an application specific integrated circuit system (ASIC). Both of these systems are represented schematically as either <b>101</b> or <b>601</b> herein. In some systems, both a microprocessor and an ASIC are used. In other systems, most if not all of the circuitry is combined onto a single chip (system on a chip). The particular implementation depends on the quantity to be made and economic considerations. A block diagram illustrating the microprocessor system is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> which shows the implementation of the system of FIG. <b>1</b>. An alternate implementation of the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> system using an ASIC is shown in FIG. <b>7</b>B. In both cases the target, which may be a rear facing child seat, is shown schematically as <b>110</b> and the three transducers as <b>131</b>, <b>132</b>, and <b>133</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, there is a digitizer coupled to the receivers <b>131</b>,<b>133</b> and the processor, and an indicator coupled to the processor. In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, there is a memory unit associated with the ASIC and also an indicator coupled to the ASIC.</p>
    <p num="p-0171">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a view of the system of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is illustrated with a box <b>295</b> shown on the front passenger seat in place of a rear facing child seat The vehicle interior monitoring system is trained to recognize that this box <b>295</b> is neither a rear facing child seat nor an occupant and therefore it is treated as an empty seat and the deployment of the airbag is suppressed. This training is accomplished using a neural network with the commercially available software disclosed above and provided, for example, by NeuralWare of Pittsburgh. The system assesses the probability that the box is a person, however, and if there is even the remotest chance that it is a person, the airbag deployment is not suppressed. The system is thus typically biased toward enabling airbag deployment.</p>
    <p num="p-0172">Side impact airbags are now used on some vehicles. Some are quite small compared to driver or passenger airbags used for frontal impact protection. Nevertheless, a small child could be injured if he is sleeping with his head against the airbag module when the airbag deploys and a vehicle interior monitoring system is needed to prevent such a deployment. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a single ultrasonic transducer <b>330</b> is shown mounted in a door adjacent airbag system <b>332</b> which houses an airbag <b>336</b>. Similar to the embodiment in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> with reference to U.S. Pat. No. 5,653,462, the airbag system <b>332</b> and components of the interior monitoring system, e.g., transducer <b>330</b>, are coupled to a processor <b>110</b>A including a control circuit <b>101</b>B for controlling deployment of the airbag <b>336</b> based on information obtained by ultrasonic transducer <b>330</b>. This device is not used to identify the object that is adjacent the airbag but merely to measure the position of the object. It can also be used to determine the presence of the object, i.e., the received waves are indicative of the presence or absence of an occupant as well as the position of the occupant or a part thereof. Instead of an ultrasonic transducer, another wave-receiving transducer may be used as described in any of the other embodiments herein, either solely for performing a wave-receiving function or for performing both a wave-receiving function and a wave-transmitting function.</p>
    <p num="p-0173">A rear-of-head detector <b>334</b> is also illustrated in FIG. <b>9</b>. This detector <b>334</b> is used to determine the distance from the headrest to the rearmost position of the occupant's head and to therefore control the position of the headrest so that it is properly positioned behind the occupant's head to offer optimum support during a rear impact. Although the headrest of most vehicles is adjustable, it is rare for an occupant to position it properly if at all. Each year there are in excess of 400,000 whiplash injuries in vehicle impacts approximately 90,000 of which are from rear impacts (source: National Highway Traffic Safety Admin.). A properly positioned headrest could substantially reduce the frequency of such injuries, which can be accomplished by the head detector of this invention. The head detector <b>334</b> is shown connected schematically to the headrest control mechanism and circuitry <b>340</b> This mechanism is capable of moving the headrest up and down and, in some cases, rotating it fore and aft.</p>
    <p num="p-0174">When the driver of a vehicle is using a cellular phone, the phone microphone frequently picks up other noise in the vehicle making it difficult for the other party to hear what is being said. This noise can be reduced if a directional microphone is used and directed toward the mouth of the driver. This is difficult to do since the position of drivers' mouths varies significantly depending on such things as the size and seating position of the driver. By using the vehicle interior identification and monitoring system of this invention, and through appropriate pattern recognition techniques, the location of the driver's head can be determined with sufficient accuracy even with ultrasonics to permit a directional microphone having a 15 degree cone angle to be aimed at the mouth of the driver resulting in a clear reception of his voice. The use of directional speakers in a similar manner also improves the telephone system performance. In the extreme case of directionality, the techniques of hypersound can be used. Such a system can also be used to permit effortless conversations between occupants of the front and rear seats. Such a system is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> which is a system similar to that of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> only using three ultrasonic transducers <b>231</b>, <b>232</b> and <b>233</b> to determine the location of the driver's head and control the pointing direction of a microphone <b>355</b>. Speaker <b>357</b> is shown connected schematically to the phone system <b>359</b> completing the system.</p>
    <p num="p-0175">The transducers <b>231</b> and <b>232</b> are placed high in the A-pillar and the third transducer <b>233</b> is placed in the headliner and displaced horizontally from transducers <b>231</b> and <b>232</b>. The two transducers <b>231</b> and <b>232</b> provide information to permit the determination of the locus of the head in the vertical direction and the combination of one of transducers <b>231</b> and <b>232</b> in conjunction with transducer <b>233</b> is used to determine the horizontal location of the head. The three transducers are placed high in the vehicle passenger compartment so that the first returned signal is from the head. Temporal filtering is used to eliminate signals which are reflections from beyond the head and the determination of the head center location is then found by the approximate centroid of the head returned signal. That is, once the location of the return signal centroid is found from each of the three received signals from transducers <b>231</b>, <b>232</b> and <b>233</b>, the distance to that point is known for each of the transducers based on the time it takes the signal to travel from the head to each transducer. In this manner, by using the three transducers plus an algorithm for finding the coordinates of the head center, using processor <b>101</b>, and through the use of known relationships between the location of the mouth and the head center, an estimate of the mouth location, and the ear locations, can be easily determined within a circle having a diameter of about five inches (13 cm). This is sufficiently accurate for a directional microphone to cover the mouth while excluding the majority of unwanted noise.</p>
    <p num="p-0176">The headlights of oncoming vehicles frequently make it difficult for the driver of a vehicle to see the road and safely operate the vehicle. This is a significant cause of accidents and much discomfort. The problem is especially severe during bad weather where rain can cause multiple reflections. Visors are now used to partially solve this problem but they do so by completely blocking the view through a large portion of the window and therefore cannot be used to cover the entire windshield. Similar problems happen when the sun is setting or rising and the driver is operating the vehicle in the direction of the sun. The vehicle interior monitoring system of this invention can contribute to the solution of this problem by determining the position of the driver's eyes. If separate sensors are used to sense the direction of the light from the on-coming vehicle or the sun, and through the use of electro-chromic glass, a liquid crystal device, or other appropriate technology, a portion of the windshield can be darkened to impose a filter between the eyes of the driver and the light source. Electro-chromic glass is a material where the color of the glass can be changed through the application of an electric current. By dividing the windshield into a controlled grid or matrix of contiguous areas and through feeding the current into the windshield from orthogonal directions, selective portions of the windshield can be darkened as desired. Other systems for selectively imposing a filter between the eyes of an occupant and the light source are currently under development.</p>
    <p num="p-0177"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates how such a system operates. A sensor <b>410</b> located on vehicle <b>402</b> determines the direction of the light <b>412</b> from the headlights of oncoming vehicle <b>404</b>. Sensor <b>410</b> is comprised of a lens and a charge-coupled device (CCD), of CMOS light sensing or similar device, with appropriate electronic circuitry which determines which elements of the CCD are being most brightly illuminated. An algorithm stored in processor <b>101</b> then calculates the direction of the light from the oncoming headlights based on the information from the CCD, or CMOS device. Transducers <b>231</b>, <b>232</b> and <b>233</b> determine the probable location of the eyes of the operator <b>210</b> of vehicle <b>402</b> in a manner such as described above in conjunction with the determination of the location of the driver's mouth in the discussion of FIG. <b>10</b>. In this case, however, the determination of the probable locus of the driver's eyes is made with an accuracy of a diameter for each eye of about 3 inches (7.5 cm). This calculation sometimes will be in error and provision is made for the driver to make an adjustment to correct for this error as described below.</p>
    <p num="p-0178">The windshield <b>416</b> of vehicle <b>402</b> is made from electro-chromic glass or comprises a liquid crystal device or similar system, and is selectively darkened at area <b>418</b> due to the application of a current along perpendicular directions <b>422</b> and <b>424</b> of windshield <b>416</b>. The particular portion of the windshield to be darkened is determined by processor <b>101</b>. Once the direction of the light from the oncoming vehicle is known and the locations of the driver's eyes are known, it is a matter of simple trigonometry to determine which areas of the windshield matrix should be darkened to impose a filter between the headlights and the driver's eyes. This is accomplished by processor <b>101</b>. A separate control system, not shown, located on the instrument panel, or at some other convenient location, allows the driver to select the amount of darkening accomplished by the system from no darkening to maximum darkening. In this manner, the driver can select the amount of light that is filtered to suit his particular physiology. The sensor <b>410</b> can either be designed to respond to a single light source or to multiple light sources to be sensed and thus multiple portions of the vehicle windshield to be darkened.</p>
    <p num="p-0179">As mentioned above, the calculations of the location of the driver's eyes using acoustic systems may be in error and therefore provision must be made to correct for this error. One such system permits the driver to adjust the center of the darkened portion of the windshield to correct for such errors through a knob on the instrument panel, steering wheel or other convenient location. Another solution permits the driver to make the adjustment by slightly moving his head. Once a calculation as to the location of the driver's eyes has been made, that calculation is not changed even though the driver moves his head slightly. It is assumed that the driver will only move his head to center the darkened portion of the windshield to optimally filter the light from the oncoming vehicle. The monitoring system will detect this initial head motion and make the correction automatically for future calculations.</p>
    <p num="p-0180">Electro-chromic glass is currently used in rear view mirrors to darken the entire mirror in response to the amount of light striking an associated sensor. This substantially reduces the ability of the driver to see objects coming from behind his vehicle. If one rear-approaching vehicle, for example, has failed to dim his lights, the mirror will be darkened to respond to the light from that vehicle making it difficult for the driver to see other vehicles that are also approaching from the rear. If the rear view mirror is selectively darkened on only those portions which cover the lights from the offending vehicle, the driver is able to see all of the light coming from the rear whether the source is bright or dim. This permits the driver to see all of the approaching vehicles not just the one with bright lights.</p>
    <p num="p-0181">Such a system is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> where rear view mirror <b>460</b> is equipped with electro-chromic glass, or comprises a liquid crystal device, having the capability of being selectively darkened, e.g., at area <b>419</b>. Associated with mirror <b>460</b> is a light sensor <b>462</b> that determines the direction of light <b>412</b> from the headlights of rear approaching vehicle <b>405</b>. In the same manner as above, transducers <b>231</b>, <b>232</b> and <b>233</b> determine the location of the eyes of the driver <b>210</b>. The signals from both sensor systems, <b>231</b>, <b>232</b> plus <b>233</b> and <b>462</b>, are combined in processor <b>101</b>, where a determination is made as to what portions of the mirror should be darkened, e.g., area <b>419</b>. Appropriate currents are then sent to the mirror in a manner similar to the windshield system described above.</p>
    <p num="p-0182">Seatbelts are most effective when the upper attachment point to the vehicle is positioned vertically close to the shoulder of the occupant being restrained. If the attachment point is too low the occupant experiences discomfort from the rubbing of the belt on his shoulder. If it is too high, the occupant may experience discomfort due to the rubbing of the belt against his neck and the occupant will move forward by a greater amount during a crash which may result in his head striking the steering wheel. Women in particular experience discomfort from an improperly adjusted seatbelt anchorage point. For these reasons, it is desirable to have the upper seatbelt attachment point located slightly above the occupant's shoulder. To accomplish this for various sized occupants, the location of the occupant's shoulder must be known which can be accomplished by the vehicle interior monitoring system described herein. Such a system is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> that is a side view of a seatbelt anchorage adjustment system. In this system, a transmitter and receiver (transducer) <b>520</b> is positioned in a convenient location, such as the headliner, located above and to the outside of the occupant's shoulder. A narrow elliptical beam <b>521</b> of energy is transmitted from transducer <b>520</b> in a manner such that it irradiates or illuminates the occupant's shoulder and headrest. An appropriate pattern recognition system as described above is then used to determine the location and position of the shoulder. This information is fed to the seatbelt anchorage height adjustment system <b>528</b>, shown schematically, which moves the attachment point <b>529</b> to the optimum vertical location.</p>
    <p num="p-0183">Acoustic resonators are devices that resonate at a preset frequency when excited at that frequency. If such a device, which has been tuned to 40 kHz, is subjected to ultrasonic radiation at 40 kHz, for example, it will return a signal that is much stronger than the reflected radiation. If such a device is placed at a particular point in the passenger compartment of a vehicle, the returned signal can be easily identified as a high magnitude narrow signal at a particular point in time which is proportional to the distance from the resonator to the receiver. Since this device can be easily identified, it provides a particularly effective method of determining the distance to a particular point in the vehicle passenger compartment (i.e., the distance between the location of the resonator and the detector). If several such resonators are used they can be tuned to slightly different frequencies and therefore separated and identified by the circuitry. Using such resonators, the positions of various objects in the vehicle can be determined. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> for example, three such resonators are placed on the vehicle seat and used to determine the location of the front and back of the seat and the top of the seat back. In this case, transducers <b>231</b> and <b>232</b>, mounted in the A-pillar <b>662</b>, are used in conjunction with resonators <b>641</b>, <b>642</b> and <b>643</b> to determine the position of the seat. Transducers <b>231</b>,<b>232</b> constitute both transmitter means for transmitting energy signals at the excitation frequencies of the resonators <b>641</b>,<b>642</b>,<b>643</b> and detector means for detecting the return energy signals from the excited resonators. Processor <b>101</b> is coupled to the transducers <b>231</b>,<b>232</b> to analyze the energy signals received by the detectors and provide information about the object with which the resonators are associated, i.e., the position of the seat in this embodiment. This information is then provided to the seat memory and adjustment system, not shown, eliminating the currently used sensors that are placed typically beneath the seat adjacent the seat adjustment motors. In the conventional system, the seat sensors must be wired into the seat adjustment system and are prone to being damaged. By using the vehicle interior monitoring system alone with inexpensive passive resonators, the conventional seat sensors can be eliminated resulting in a cost saving to the vehicle manufacturer. An efficient reflector, such as a parabolic shaped reflector, can be used in a similar manner as the resonator.</p>
    <p num="p-0184">Resonators or reflectors, of the type described above can be used for making a variety of position measurements in the vehicle. These resonators are made to resonate at a particular frequency. If the number of resonators increases beyond a reasonable number, dual frequency resonators can be used. A pair of frequencies is then used to identify a particular location. Alternately, resonators tuned to a particular frequency can be used in combination with special transmitters, which transmit at the tuned frequency, which are designed to work with a particular resonator or group of resonators. The cost of the transducers is sufficiently low to permit special transducers to be used for special purposes. The use of resonators which resonate at different frequencies requires that they be irradiated by radiation containing those frequencies.</p>
    <p num="p-0185">Another application for a resonator of the type described is to determine the location of the seatbelt and therefore determine whether it is in use If it is known that the occupants are wearing seatbelts, the airbag deployment parameters can be controlled or adjusted based on the knowledge of seatbelt use, e.g., the deployment threshold can be increased since the airbag is not needed in low velocity accidents if the occupants are already restrained by seatbelts. Deployment of other occupant restraint devices could also be effected based on the knowledge of seatbelt use. This will reduce the number of deployments for cases where the airbag provides little or no improvement in safety over the seatbelt. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, for example, shows the placement of a resonator <b>602</b> on the front surface of the seatbelt where it can be sensed by the transducers <b>231</b> and <b>232</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0186">Such a system can also be used to positively identify or confirm the presence of a rear facing child seat in the vehicle, if the child seat is equipped with a resonator. In this case, a resonator <b>603</b> is placed on the forwardmost portion of the child seat, or in some other convenient position, as shown in FIG. <b>1</b>A. The resonator <b>603</b>, or other type of signal generating device which generates a signal upon excitation, e.g., by a transmitted energy signal, can be used not only to determine the orientation of the child seat but also to determine the position of the child seat (in essentially the same manner as described above with respect to determining the position of the seat and the position of the seatbelt).</p>
    <p num="p-0187">The determination of the presence of a child seat can be used to affect another system in the vehicle. Most importantly, deployment of an occupant restraint device can be controlled depending on whether a child seat is present. Control of the occupant restraint device may entail suppression of deployment of the device. If the occupant restraint device is an airbag, e.g., a frontal airbag or a side airbag, control of the airbag deployment may entail not only suppression of the deployment but also depowered deployment, adjustment of the orientation of the airbag, adjustment of the inflation rate or inflation time and/or adjustment of the deflation rate or time.</p>
    <p num="p-0188">Other uses for such resonators include placing them on doors and windows in order to determine whether either is open or closed. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>, for example, such a resonator <b>604</b> is placed on the top of the window and is sensed by transducers <b>611</b> and <b>612</b>. In this case, transducers <b>611</b> and <b>612</b> also monitor the space between the edge of the window glass and the top of the window opening. Many vehicles now have systems which permit the rapid opening of the window, called “express open”, by a momentary push of a button. For example, when a vehicle approaches a tollbooth, the driver needs only touch the window control button and the window opens rapidly. Some automobile manufacturers do not wish to use such systems for closing the window, called “express close”, because of the fear that the hand of the driver, or of a child leaning forward from the rear seat, or some other object, could get caught between the window and window frame. If the space between the edge of the window and the window frame were monitored with an interior monitoring system, this problem can be solved. The presence of the resonator or reflector <b>604</b> on the top of the window glass also gives a positive indication of where the top surface is and reflections from below that point can be ignored.</p>
    <p num="p-0189">Various design variations of the window monitoring system are possible and the particular choice will depend on the requirements of the vehicle manufacturer and the characteristics of the vehicle. Two systems will be briefly described here.</p>
    <p num="p-0190">In the first example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a single transmitter/receiver (transducer) <b>613</b> is used in place of and located centrally midway between the transducers <b>611</b> and <b>612</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A. A</figref> recording of the output of transducer <b>613</b> is made of the open window without an object in the space between the window edge and the top of the window frame. When in operation, the transducer <b>613</b> receives the return signal from the space it is monitoring and compares that signal with the stored signal referenced above. This is done by processor <b>601</b>. If the difference between the test signal and the stored signal indicates that there is a reflecting object in the monitored space, the window is prevented from closing in the express close mode. If the window is part way up, a reflection will be received from the edge of the window glass which, in most cases, is easily identifiable from the reflection of a hand for example. A simple algorithm based on the intensity of the reflection in most cases is sufficient to determine that an object rather than the window edge is in the monitored space. In other cases, the algorithm is used to identify the window edge and ignore that reflection and all other reflections which are lower (i.e. later in time) than the window edge. In all cases, the system will default in not permitting the express close if there is any doubt. The operator can still close the window by holding the switch in the window closing position and the window will then close slowly as it now does in vehicles without the express close feature.</p>
    <p num="p-0191">In the second system, two transducers <b>611</b> and <b>612</b> are used as shown in FIG. <b>16</b>A and the processor <b>601</b> comprises a neural network. In this example the system is trained for all cases where the window is down and at intermediate locations. In operation, the transducers monitor the window space and feed the received signals to processor <b>601</b>. As long as the signals are similar to one of the signals for which the network was trained, the express close system is enabled. As before, the default is to suppress the express close.</p>
    <p num="p-0192">The use of a resonator, or reflector, to determine whether the vehicle door is properly shut is illustrated in FIG. <b>17</b>. In this case, the resonator <b>702</b> is placed in the B-pillar in such a manner that it is shielded by the door, or by a cover or other inhibiting mechanism (not shown) engaged by the door, and prevented from resonating when the door is closed. Resonator <b>702</b> provides waves <b>704</b>. If transducers such as <b>231</b> and <b>232</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are used in this system, the closed-door condition would be determined by the absence of a return signal from the B-pillar <b>702</b> resonator. This system permits the substitution of an inexpensive resonator for a more expensive and less reliable electrical switch.</p>
    <p num="p-0193">The use of an acoustic resonator has been described above. For those cases where an infrared laser system is used, an optical mirror would replace the mechanical resonator used with the acoustic system. In the acoustic system, the resonator can be any of a variety of tuned resonating systems including an acoustic cavity or a vibrating mechanical element.</p>
    <p num="p-0194">A neural network, or other pattern recognition system, can be trained to recognize certain people as permitted operators of a vehicle. In this case, if a non-recognized person attempts to operate the vehicle, the system can disable the vehicle and/or sound an alarm as illustrated in FIG. <b>18</b>. In this figure the sensing transducers are shown as before as <b>231</b>A, <b>232</b>A and <b>233</b>A, the alarm system schematically as <b>708</b> and the alarm as <b>705</b>. Since it is unlikely that an unauthorized operator will resemble the authorized operator, the neural network system can be quite tolerant of differences in appearance of the operator. The system defaults to where a key must be used in the case that the system doesn't recognize the driver or the owner wishes to allow another person to operate the vehicle. The transducers <b>231</b>A, <b>232</b>A and <b>233</b>A are sensitive to infrared radiation and the operator is irradiated with infrared waves from transducer <b>231</b>A. This is necessary due to the small size of the features which need to be recognized for high accuracy of recognition. An alternate system uses an infrared laser, which can be <b>231</b>A in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, to irradiate or illuminate the operator and a CCD or CMOS device, which can be represented as <b>232</b>A in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, to receive the reflected image. In this case, the recognition of the operator is accomplished using a pattern recognition system such as described in Popesco, V. and Vincent, J. M. “Location of Facial Features Using a Boltzmann Machine to Implement Geometric Constraints”, Chapter 14 of Lisboa, P. J. G. and Taylor, M. J. Editors, <i>Techniques and Applications of Neural Networks</i>, Ellis Horwood Publishers, New York, 1993. In the present case a larger CCD element array containing 100,000 or more elements would in many cases be used instead of the 16 by 16 or 256 element CCD array used by Popesco and Vincent. In fact, the field of facial recognition has expanded greatly in the past few years and systems are available that can be used within a vehicle to recognize the operator based on facial features, the pattern of blood vessels in the iris, or other visual biometric features of the operator and particularly those related to the operator's head and particularly his or her face. Naturally, other biometric features can also be used alone or in combination including fingerprints, weight, voiceprint, handprint, etc.</p>
    <p num="p-0195">The human mind has little problem recognizing faces even when they are partially occluded such as with a hat, sunglasses or a scarf, for example. With the increase in low cost computing power, it is now possible to train a rather large neural network, perhaps a modular neural network, to recognize most of those cases where a human mind will also be successful.</p>
    <p num="p-0196">Once a vehicle interior monitoring system employing a sophisticated pattern recognition system, such as a neural network or fuzzy logic system, is in place, it is possible to monitor the motions of the driver over time and determine if he is falling asleep or has otherwise become incapacitated. In such an event, the vehicle can be caused to respond in a number of different ways. One such system is illustrated in FIG. <b>19</b> and consists of a monitoring system having transducers <b>231</b>, <b>232</b> and <b>233</b> plus microprocessor <b>101</b>, such as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, programmed to compare the motions of the driver over time and trained to recognize changes in behavior representative of becoming incapacitated. If the system determines that there is a reasonable probability that the driver has fallen asleep, for example, then it can turn on a warning light shown here as <b>805</b> or send a warning sound. If the driver fails to respond to the warning by pushing a button <b>806</b>, for example, then the horn and lights can be operated in a manner to warn other vehicles and the vehicle brought to a stop. One novel approach, not shown, would be to use the horn as the button <b>806</b>. For a momentary depression of the horn, for this case, the horn would not sound. Naturally other responses can also be programmed.</p>
    <p num="p-0197">An even more sophisticated system of monitoring the behavior of the driver is to track his eye motions using such techniques as are described in: Freidman et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,648,052 “Eye Tracker Communication System”; Heyner et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,720,189 “Eye Position Sensor”; Hutchinson, U.S. Pat. No. 4,836,670 “Eye Movement Detector”; and Hutchinson, U.S. Pat. No. 4,950,069 “Eye Movement Detector With Improved Calibration and Speed”, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety to the extent the disclosure of these references is necessary. The detection of the impaired driver in particular can be best determined by these techniques. Also, in a similar manner as described in these patents, the motion of the driver's eyes can be used to control various systems in the vehicle permitting hands off control of the entertainment system, heating and air conditioning system or all of the other systems described above. Although some of these systems have been described in the afore-mentioned patents, none have made use of neural networks for interpreting the eye movements</p>
    <p num="p-0198">In most of the applications described above, single frequency energy was used to irradiate various occupying items of the passenger compartment. This was for illustrative purposes only and this invention is not limited to single frequency irradiation. In many applications, it is useful to use several discrete frequencies or a band of frequencies. In this manner, considerably greater information is received from the reflected irradiation permitting greater discrimination between different classes of objects. In general each object will have different reflectivities and transmissivities at each frequency. Also, the different resonators placed at different positions in the passenger compartment can now be tuned to different frequencies making it easier to isolate one resonator from another.</p>
    <p num="p-0199">Among the inventions disclosed above is an arrangement for obtaining and conveying information about occupancy of a passenger compartment of a vehicle comprises at least one wave-receiving sensor for receiving waves from the passenger compartment, generating means coupled to the wave-receiving sensor(s) for generating information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment based on the waves received by the wave-receiving sensor(s) and communications means coupled to the generating means for transmitting the information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment. As such, response personnel can receive the information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment and respond appropriately, if necessary. There may be several wave-receiving sensors and they may be, e.g., ultrasonic wave-receiving sensors, electromagnetic wave-receiving sensors, capacitance sensors, or combinations thereof. The information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment can include the number of occupants in the passenger compartment, as well as whether each occupant is moving non-reflexively and breathing. A transmitter may be provided for transmitting waves into the passenger compartment such that each wave-receiving sensor receives waves transmitted from the transmitter and modified by passing into and at least partially through the passenger compartment. One or more memory units may be coupled to the generating means for storing the information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment and to the communications means. The communications means then can interrogate the memory unit(s) upon a crash of the vehicle to thereby obtain the information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment. In one particularly useful embodiment, means for determining the health state of at least one occupant are provided, e.g., a heartbeat sensor, a motion sensor such as a micropower impulse radar sensor for detecting motion of the at least one occupant and motion sensor for determining whether the occupant(s) is/are breathing, and coupled to the communications means. The communications means can interrogate the health state determining means upon a crash of the vehicle to thereby obtain and transmit the health state of the occupant(s). The health state determining means can also comprise a chemical sensor for analyzing the amount of carbon dioxide in the passenger compartment or around the at least one occupant or for detecting the presence of blood in the passenger compartment. Movement of the occupant can be determined by monitoring the weight distribution of the occupant(s), or an analysis of waves from the space occupied by the occupant(s). Each wave-receiving sensor generates a signal representative of the waves received thereby and the generating means may comprise a processor for receiving and analyzing the signal from the wave-receiving sensor in order to generate the information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment. The processor can comprises pattern recognition means for classifying an occupant of the seat so that the information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment includes the classification of the occupant. The wave-receiving sensor may be a micropower impulse radar sensor adapted to detect motion of an occupant whereby the motion of the occupant or absence of motion of the occupant is indicative of whether the occupant is breathing. As such, the information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment generated by the generating means is an indication of whether the occupant is breathing. Also, the wave-receiving sensor may generate a signal representative of the waves received thereby and the generating means receive this signal over time and determine whether any occupants in the passenger compartment are moving. As such, the information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment generated by the generating means includes the number of moving and non-moving occupants in the passenger compartment.</p>
    <p num="p-0200">A related method for obtaining and conveying information about occupancy of a passenger compartment of a vehicle comprises the steps of receiving waves from the passenger compartment, generating information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment based on the received waves, and transmitting the information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment whereby response personnel can receive the information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment. Waves may be transmitted into the passenger compartment whereby the transmitted waves are modified by passing into and at least partially through the passenger compartment and then received. The information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment may be stored in at least one memory unit which is subsequently interrogated upon a crash of the vehicle to thereby obtain the information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment. A signal representative of the received waves can be generated by sensors and analyzed in order to generate the information about the state of health of at least one occupant of the passenger compartment and/or to generate the information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment (i.e., determine non-reflexive movement and/or breathing indicating life). Pattern recognition techniques, e.g., a trained neural network, can be applied to analyze the signal and thereby recognize and identify any occupants of the passenger compartment. In this case, the identification of the occupants of the passenger compartment can be included into the information about the occupancy of the passenger compartment.</p>
    <p num="p-0201">Other embodiments disclosed above are directed to methods and arrangements for controlling deployment of an airbag. One exemplifying embodiment of an arrangement for controlling deployment of an airbag from an airbag module to protect an occupant in a seat of a vehicle in a crash comprises determining means for determining the position of the occupant or a part thereof, and control means coupled to the determining means for controlling deployment of the airbag based on the determined position of the occupant or part thereof. The determining means may comprise receiver means, e.g., a wave-receiving transducer such as an electromagnetic wave receiver (such as a CCD, CMOS, capacitor plate or antenna) or an ultrasonic transducer, for receiving waves from a space above a seat portion of the seat and processor means coupled to the receiver means for generating a signal representative of the position of the occupant or part thereof based on the waves received by the receiver means. The determining means can include transmitter means for transmitting waves into the space above the seat portion of the seat which are receivable by the receiver means. The receiver means may be mounted in various positions in the vehicle, including in a door of the vehicle, in which case, the distance between the occupant and the door would be determined, i.e., to determine whether the occupant is leaning against the door, and possibly adjacent the airbag module if it is situated in the door, or elsewhere in the vehicle. The control means are designed to suppress deployment of the airbag, control the time at which deployment of the airbag starts, control the rate of gas flow into the airbag, control the rate of gas flow out of the airbag and/or control the rate of deployment of the airbag.</p>
    <p num="p-0202">Another arrangement for controlling deployment of an airbag comprises determining means for determining whether an occupant is present in the seat, and control means coupled to the determining means for controlling deployment of the airbag based on whether an occupant is present in the seat, e.g., to suppress deployment if the seat is unoccupied. The determining means may comprise receiver means, e.g., a wave-receiving transducer such as an ultrasonic transducer, CCD, CMOS, capacitor plate, capacitance sensor or antenna, for receiving waves from a space above a seat portion of the seat and processor means coupled to the receiver means for generating a signal representative of the presence or absence of an occupant in the seat based on the waves received by the receiver means. The determining means may optionally include transmitter means for transmitting waves into the space above the seat portion of the seat which are receivable by the receiver means. Further, the determining means may be designed to determine the position of the occupant or a part thereof when an occupant is in the seat in which case, the control means are arranged to control deployment of side airbag based on the determined position of the occupant or part thereof.</p>
    <p num="p-0203">One method for controlling deployment of an airbag from an airbag module comprising the steps of determining the position of the occupant or a part thereof, and controlling deployment of the airbag based on the determined position of the occupant or part thereof. The position of the occupant or part thereof is determined as in the arrangement described above.</p>
    <p num="p-0204">Another method for controlling deployment of an airbag comprises the steps of determining whether an occupant is present in the seat, and controlling deployment of the airbag based on the presence or absence of an occupant in the seat. The presence of the occupant, and optionally position of the occupant or a part thereof, are determined as in the arrangement described above.</p>
    <p num="p-0205">Furthermore, disclosed above are methods for controlling a system in the vehicle based on an occupying item in which at least a portion of the passenger compartment in which the occupying item is situated is irradiated, radiation from the occupying item are received, e.g., by a plurality of sensors or transducers each arranged at a discrete location, the received radiation is processed by a processor in order to create one or more electronic signals characteristic of the occupying item based on the received radiation, each signal containing a pattern representative and/or characteristic of the occupying item and each signal is then categorized by utilizing pattern recognition techniques for recognizing and thus identifying the class of the occupying item. In the pattern recognition process, each signal is processed into a categorization thereof based on data corresponding to patterns of received radiation stored within the pattern recognition means and associated with possible classes of occupying items of the vehicle. Once the signal(s) is/are categorized, the operation of the system in the vehicle may be affected based on the categorization of the signal(s), and thus based on the occupying item. If the system in the vehicle is a vehicle communication system, then an output representative of the number of occupants in the vehicle may be produced based on the categorization of the signal(s) and the vehicle communication system thus controlled based on such output. Similarly, if the system in the vehicle is a vehicle entertainment system or heating and air conditioning system, then an output representative of specific seat occupancy may be produced based on the categorization of the signal(s) and the vehicle entertainment system or heating and air conditioning system thus controlled based on such output. In one embodiment designed to ensure safe operation of the vehicle, the attentiveness of the occupying item is determined from the signal(s) if the occupying item is an occupant, and in addition to affecting the system in the vehicle based on the categorization of the signal, the system in the vehicle is affected based on the determined attentiveness of the occupant.</p>
    <p num="p-0206">One embodiment of the interior monitoring system in accordance with the invention comprises means for irradiating at least a portion of the passenger compartment in which an occupying item is situated, receiver means for receiving radiation from the occupying item, e.g., a plurality of receivers, each arranged at a discrete location, processor means coupled to the receivers for processing the received radiation from each receiver in order to create a respective electronic signal characteristic of the occupying item based on the received radiation, each signal containing a pattern representative of the occupying item, categorization means coupled to the processor means for categorizing the signals, and output means coupled to the categorization means for affecting another system within the vehicle based on the categorization of the signals characteristic of the occupying item. The categorization means may use a pattern recognition technique for recognizing and thus identifying the class of the occupying item by processing the signals into a categorization thereof based on data corresponding to patterns of received radiation and associated with possible classes of occupying items of the vehicle. Each signal may comprise a plurality of data, all of which is compared to the data corresponding to patterns of received radiation and associated with possible classes of contents of the vehicle. In one specific embodiment, the system includes location determining means coupled to the processor means for determining the location of the occupying item, e.g., based on the received radiation such that the output means which are coupled to the location determining means, in addition to affecting the other system based on the categorization of the signals characteristic of the occupying item, affect the system based on the determined location of the occupying item. In another embodiment to determine the presence or absence of an occupant, the categorization means comprise pattern recognition means for recognizing the presence or absence of an occupying item in the passenger compartment by processing each signal into a categorization thereof signal based on data corresponding to patterns of received radiation and associated with possible occupying items of the vehicle and the absence of such occupying items.</p>
    <p num="p-0207">Also disclosed above is an arrangement for controlling audio reception by at least one occupant of a passenger compartment of the vehicle comprises a monitoring system for determining the position of the occupant(s) and sound generating means coupled to the monitoring system for generating specific sounds. The sound generating means are automatically adjustable based on the determined position of the occupant(s) such that the specific sounds are audible to the occupant(s). The sound generating means may utilize hypersonic sound, e.g., comprise one or more pairs of ultrasonic frequency generators for generating ultrasonic waves whereby for each pair, the ultrasonic frequency generators generate ultrasonic waves which mix to thereby create new audio frequencies. Each pair of ultrasonic frequency generators is controlled independently of the others so that each occupant is able to have different new audio frequencies created. For noise cancellation purposes, the vehicle can include a system for detecting the presence and direction of unwanted noise whereby the sound generating means are coupled to the unwanted noise presence and detection system and direct sound to prevent reception of the unwanted noise by the occupant(s). If the sound generating means comprise speakers, the speakers are controllable based on the determined positions of the occupants such that at least one speaker directs sounds toward each occupant. The monitoring system may be any type of system which is capable of determining the location of the occupant, or more specifically, the location of the head or ears of the occupants. For example, the monitoring system may comprise at least one wave-receiving sensor for receiving waves from the passenger compartment, and a processor coupled to the wave-receiving sensor(s) for determining the position of the occupant(s) based on the waves received by the wave-receiving sensor(s). The monitoring system can also determine the position of objects other than the occupants and control the sound generating means in consideration of the determined position of the objects.</p>
    <p num="p-0208">A related method for controlling audio reception by occupants in a vehicle comprises the steps of determining the position of at least one occupant of the vehicle, providing a sound generator for generating specific sounds and automatically adjusting the sound generator based on the determined position of the occupant(s) such that the specific sounds are audible to the occupant(s). The features of the arrangement described above may be used in the method.</p>
    <p num="p-0209">Another arrangement for controlling audio reception by occupants of a passenger compartment of the vehicle comprises a monitoring system for determining the presence of any occupants and sound generating means coupled to the monitoring system for generating specific sounds. The sound generating means are automatically adjustable based on the determined presence of any occupants such that the specific sounds are audible to any occupants present in the passenger compartment. The monitoring system and sound generating means may be as in the arrangement described above. However, in this case, the sound generating means are controlled based on the determined presence of the occupants.</p>
    <p num="p-0210">Also disclosed above is a system for determining occupancy of a vehicle which comprises a radar system for emitting radio waves into an interior of the vehicle in which objects might be situated and receiving radio waves and a processor coupled to the radar system for determining the presence of any repetitive motions indicative of a living occupant in the vehicle based on the radio waves received by the radar system such that the presence of living occupants in the vehicle is ascertainable upon the determination of the presence of repetitive motions indicative of a living occupant. Repetitive motions indicative of a living occupant may be a heart beat or breathing as reflected by movement of the chest. Thus, for example, the processor may be programmed to analyze the frequency of the repetitive motions based on the radio waves received by the radar system whereby a frequency in a predetermined range is indicative of a heartbeat or breathing. The processor could also be designed to analyze motion only at particular locations in the vehicle in which a chest of any occupants would be located whereby motion at the particular locations is indicative of a heartbeat or breathing. Enhancements of the invention include the provision of means for determining locations of the chest of any occupants whereby the radar system is adjusted based on the determined location of the chest of any occupants. The radar system may be a micropower impulse radar system which monitors motion at a set distance from the radar system, i.e., utilize range-gating techniques. The radar system can be positioned to emit radio waves into a passenger compartment or trunk of the vehicle and/or toward a seat of the vehicle such that the processor determines whether the seats are occupied by living beings. Another enhancement would be to couple a reactive system to the processor for reacting to the determination by the processor of the presence of any repetitive motions. Such a reactive system might be an air connection device for providing or enabling air flow between the interior of the vehicle and the surrounding environment, if the presence of living beings is detected in a closed interior space. The reactive system could also be a security system for providing a warning. In one particularly useful embodiment, the radar system emits radio waves into a trunk of the vehicle and the reactive system is a trunk release for opening the trunk. The reactive system could also be airbag system which is controlled based on the determined presence of repetitive motions in the vehicle and a window opening system for opening a window associated with the passenger compartment.</p>
    <p num="p-0211">A method for determining occupancy of the vehicle disclosed above comprises the steps of emitting radio waves into an interior of the vehicle in which objects might be situated, receiving radio waves after interaction with any objects and determining the presence of any repetitive motions indicative of a living occupant in the vehicle based on the received radio waves such that the presence of living occupants in the vehicle is ascertainable upon the determination of the presence of repetitive motions indicative of a living occupant. Determining the presence of any repetitive motions can entail analyzing the frequency of the repetitive motions based on the received radio waves whereby a frequency in a predetermined range is indicative of a heartbeat or breathing and/or analyzing motion only at particular locations in the vehicle in which a chest of any occupants would be located whereby motion at the particular locations is indicative of a heartbeat or breathing. If the locations of the chest of any occupants are determined, the emission of radio waves can be adjusted based thereon. A radio wave emitter and receiver can be arranged to emit radio waves into a passenger compartment of the vehicle. Upon a determination of the presence of any occupants in the vehicle, air flow between the interior of the vehicle and the surrounding environment can be enabled or provided. A warning can also be provided upon a determination of the presence of any occupants in the vehicle. If the radio wave emitter and receiver emit radio waves into a trunk of the vehicle, the trunk can be designed to automatically open upon a determination of the presence of any occupants in the trunk to thereby prevent children or pets from suffocating if inadvertently left in the trunk. In a similar manner, if the radio wave emitter and receiver emits radio waves into a passenger compartment of the vehicle, a window associated with the passenger compartment can be automatically opened upon a determination of the presence of any occupants in the passenger compartment to thereby prevent people or pets from suffocating if the temperature of the air in the passenger compartment rises to an dangerous level.</p>
    <p num="p-0212">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20-27</figref>, a section of the passenger compartment of an automobile is shown generally as <b>1000</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20. A</figref> driver of a vehicle <b>1101</b> sits on a seat <b>1102</b> behind a steering wheel <b>1103</b> which contains an airbag assembly <b>1104</b>. Five transmitter and/or receiver assemblies <b>1110</b>, <b>1111</b>, <b>1112</b>, <b>1113</b> and <b>1114</b> are positioned at various places in the passenger compartment to determine the location of the head, chest and torso of the driver relative to the airbag. Usually, in any given implementation, only one or two of the transmitters and receivers would be used depending on their mounting locations as described below.</p>
    <p num="p-0213"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates several of the possible locations of such devices. For example, transmitter and receiver <b>1110</b> emits ultrasonic acoustical waves which bounce off the chest of the driver and return. Periodically a burst of ultrasonic waves at about 50 kilohertz is emitted by the transmitter/receiver and then the echo, or reflected signal, is detected by the same or different device An associated electronic circuit measures the time between the transmission and the reception of the ultrasonic waves and thereby determines the distance from the transmitter/receiver to the driver based on the velocity of sound. This information is then sent to the crash sensor and diagnostic circuitry which determines if the driver is close enough to the airbag that a deployment might, by itself, cause injury to the driver. In such a case the circuit disables the airbag system and thereby prevents its deployment. In an alternate case, the sensor algorithm assesses the probability that a crash requiring an airbag is in process and waits until that probability exceeds an amount that is dependent on the position of the occupant. Thus, for example, the sensor might decide to deploy the airbag based on a need probability assessment of 50%, if the decision must be made immediately for an occupant approaching the airbag, but might wait until the probability rises to 95% for a more distant occupant. Although a driver system has been illustrated, the passenger system would be identical.</p>
    <p num="p-0214">In another implementation, the sensor algorithm may determine the rate that gas is generated to affect the rate that the airbag is inflated. In all of these cases the position of the occupant is used to affect the deployment of the airbag either as to whether or not it should be deployed at all, the time of deployment or as to the rate of inflation.</p>
    <p num="p-0215">The ultrasonic transmitter/receiver <b>1110</b> is similar to that used on modern auto-focus cameras such as manufactured by the Polaroid Corporation. Other camera auto-focusing systems use different technologies, which are also applicable here, to achieve the same distance to object determination. One camera system manufactured by Fuji of Japan, for example, uses a stereoscopic system which could also be used to determine the position of a vehicle occupant providing there is sufficient light available. In the case of insufficient light, a source of infrared light can be added to illuminate the driver. In a related implementation, a source of infrared light is reflected off of the windshield and illuminates the vehicle occupant. An infrared receiver <b>1114</b> is located attached to the rear view mirror <b>1105</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>20</b>. Alternately, the infrared could be sent by the device <b>1114</b> and received by a receiver elsewhere. Since any of the devices shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 22</figref> could be either transmitters or receivers or both, for simplicity, only the transmitted and not the reflected wave fronts are illustrated.</p>
    <p num="p-0216">In the above-described system, a lens within receptor <b>1114</b> captures the reflected infrared light from the head or chest of the driver and displays it onto a charge coupled device (CCD), CMOS or equivalent array. One type of CCD is that used in television cameras to convert an image into an electrical signal. For the discussion of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20-27</figref> at least, a CCD will be used to include all devices which are capable of converting light frequencies, including infrared, into electrical signals. The CCD is scanned and the focal point of the lens is altered, under control of an appropriate circuit, until the sharpest image of the driver's head or chest results and the distance is then known from the focusing circuitry. The precision of this measurement is enhanced if two receptors are used which can either project images onto a single CCD or on separate CCD's. In the first case, one of the lenses could be moved to bring the two images into coincidence while in the other case the displacement of the images needed for coincidence would be determined mathematically. Naturally, other systems could be used to keep track of the different images such as the use of filters creating different infrared frequencies for the different receptors and again using the same CCD array. In addition to greater precision in determining the location of the occupant, the separation of the two receptors can also be used to minimize the effects of hands, arms or other extremities which might be very close to the airbag. In this case, where the receptors are mounted high on the dashboard on either side of the steering wheel, an arm, for example, would show up as a thin object but much closer to the airbag than the larger body parts and, therefore, easily distinguished and eliminated, permitting the sensors to determine the distance to the occupant's chest. This is one example of the use of pattern recognition.</p>
    <p num="p-0217">An optical infrared transmitter and receiver assembly is shown generally at <b>1112</b> in FIG. <b>20</b> and is mounted onto the instrument panel facing the windshield. Although not shown in this view, reference <b>1112</b> consists of three devices, one transmitter and two receivers, one on each side of the transmitter. In this case the windshield is used to reflect the illumination light, and also the light reflected back by the driver, in a manner similar to the “heads-up” display which is now being offered on several automobile models. The “heads-up” display, of course, is currently used only to display information to the driver and is not used to reflect light from the driver to a receiver. In this case, the distance to the driver is determined stereoscopically through the use of the two receivers. In its most elementary sense, this system can be used to measure the distance of the driver to the airbag module. In more sophisticated applications, the position of the driver, and particularly of the drivers head, can be monitored over time and any behavior, such as a drooping head, indicative of the driver falling asleep or of being incapacitated by drugs, alcohol or illness can be detected and appropriate action taken. Other forms of radiation including visual light, radar and microwaves as well as high frequency ultra sound could also be used by those skilled in the art.</p>
    <p num="p-0218">Particular mention should be made of the use of radar since inexpensive antennas are now readily available. A scanning radar beam is used in this implementation and the reflected signal is received by a phase array antenna to generate an image of the occupant for input into the appropriate pattern detection circuitry. The word circuitry as used herein includes, in addition to normal electronic circuits, a microprocessor and appropriate software.</p>
    <p num="p-0219">Electromagnetic or ultrasonic energy can be transmitted in three modes in determining the position of an occupant. In most of the cases disclosed above, it is assumed that the energy will be transmitted in a broad diverging beam which interacts with a substantial portion of the occupant. This method has the disadvantage that it will reflect first off the nearest object and, especially if that object is close to the transmitter, it may mask the true position of the occupant. This can be partially overcome through the use of the second mode which uses a narrow beam. In this case, several narrow beams are used. These beams are aimed in different directions toward the occupant from a position sufficiently away from the occupant that interference is unlikely. A single receptor could be used providing the beams are either cycled on at different times or are of different frequencies. Another approach is to use a single beam emanating from a location which has an unimpeded view of the occupant such as the windshield header. If two spaced apart CCD array receivers are used, the angle of the reflected beam can be determined and the location of the occupant can be calculated. The third mode is to use a single beam in a manner so that it scans back and forth or up and down, or in some other pattern, across the occupant. In this manner, an image of the occupant can be obtained using a single receptor and pattern recognition software can be used to locate the head or chest of the occupant. The beam approach is most applicable to electromagnetic energy but high frequency ultra sound can also be formed into a narrow beam.</p>
    <p num="p-0220">The windshield header as used herein includes the space above the front windshield including the first few inches of the roof.</p>
    <p num="p-0221">A similar effect to modifying the wave transmission mode can also be obtained by varying the characteristics of the receptors. Through appropriate lenses or reflectors, receptors can be made to be most sensitive to radiation emitted from a particular direction. In this manner a single broad beam transmitter can be used coupled with an array of focused receivers to obtain a rough image of the occupant.</p>
    <p num="p-0222">Each of these methods of transmission or reception could be used, for example, at any of the preferred mounting locations shown in FIG. <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0223">Another preferred location of a transmitter/receiver for use with airbags is shown at <b>1111</b> in FIG. <b>20</b>. In this case, the device is attached to the steering wheel and gives an accurate determination of the distance of the driver's chest from the airbag module. This implementation would generally be used with another device such as <b>1110</b> at another location.</p>
    <p num="p-0224">Alternate mountings for the transmitter/receiver include various locations on the instrument panel on either side of the steering column such as <b>1113</b> in FIG. <b>20</b>. Also, although some of the devices herein illustrated assume that for the ultrasonic system the same device would be used for both transmitting and receiving waves, there are advantages in separating these functions. Since there is a time lag required for the system to stabilize after transmitting a pulse before it can receive a pulse, close measurements are enhanced, for example, by using separate transmitters and receivers. In addition, if the ultrasonic transmitter and receiver are separated, the transmitter can transmit continuously providing the transmitted signal is modulated in such a manner that the received signal can be compared with the transmitted signal to determine the time it took for the waves to reach and reflect off of the occupant. Many methods exist for this modulation including varying the frequency or amplitude of the waves or by pulse modulation or coding. In all cases, the logic circuit which controls the sensor and receiver must be able to determine when the signal which was most recently received was transmitted. In this manner, even though the time that it takes for the signal to travel from the transmitter to the receiver, via reflection off of the occupant, may be several milliseconds, information as to the position of the occupant is received continuously which permits an accurate, although delayed, determination of the occupant's velocity from successive position measurements. Conventional ultrasonic distance measuring devices must wait for the signal to travel to the occupant and return before a new signal is sent. This greatly limits the frequency at which position data can be obtained to the formula where the frequency is equal to the velocity of sound divided by two times the distance to the occupant. For example, if the velocity of sound is taken at about 1000 feet per second, occupant position data for an occupant located one foot from the transmitter can only be obtained every 2 milliseconds which corresponds to a frequency of 500 cycles per second.</p>
    <p num="p-0225">This slow frequency that data can be collected seriously degrades the accuracy of the velocity calculation. The reflection of ultrasonic waves from the clothes of an occupant, for example, can cause noise or scatter in the position measurement and lead to significant inaccuracies in a given measurement. When many measurements are taken more rapidly, as in the technique described here, these inaccuracies can be averaged and a significant improvement in the accuracy of the velocity calculation results.</p>
    <p num="p-0226">The determination of the velocity of the occupant need not be derived from successive distance measurements. A potentially more accurate method is to make use of the Doppler effect where the frequency of the reflected waves differs from the transmitted waves by an amount which is proportional to the occupant's velocity. In a preferred embodiment, a single ultrasonic transmitter and a separate receiver are used to measure the position of the occupant, by the travel time of a known signal, and the velocity, by the frequency shift of that signal. Although the Doppler effect has been used to determine whether an occupant has fallen asleep, it has not heretofore been used in conjunction with a position measuring device to determine whether an occupant is likely to become out of position and thus in danger of being injured by a deploying airbag. This combination is particularly advantageous since both measurements can be accurately and efficiently determined using a single transmitter and receiver pair resulting in a low cost system.</p>
    <p num="p-0227">Another preferred embodiment makes use of radio waves and a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). In this embodiment, the frequency of the oscillator is controlled through the use of a phase detector which adjusts the oscillator frequency so that exactly one half wave occupies the distance from the transmitter to the receiver via reflection off of the occupant. The adjusted frequency is thus inversely proportional to the distance from the transmitter to the occupant. Alternately, an FM phase discriminator can be used as known to those skilled in the art. These systems could be used in any of the locations illustrated in FIG. <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0228">A passive infrared system could be used to determine the position of an occupant relative to an airbag. Passive infrared measures the infrared radiation emitted by the occupant and compares it to the background. As such, unless it is coupled with a pattern recognition system, it can best be used to determine that an occupant is moving toward the airbag since the amount of infrared radiation would then be increasing. Therefore, it could be used to estimate the velocity of the occupant but not his/her position relative to the airbag, since the absolute amount of such radiation will depend on the occupant's size, temperature and clothes as well as on his position. When passive infrared is used in conjunction with another distance measuring system, such as the ultrasonic system described above, the combination would be capable of determining both the position and velocity of the occupant relative to the airbag. Such a combination would be economical since only the simplest circuits would be required In one implementation, for example, a group of waves from an ultrasonic transmitter could be sent to an occupant and the reflected group received by a receiver. The distance to the occupant would be proportional to the time between the transmitted and received groups of waves and the velocity determined from the passive infrared system. This system could be used in any of the locations illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> as well as others not illustrated.</p>
    <p num="p-0229">Passive infrared could also be used effectively in conjunction with a pattern recognition system. In this case, the passive infrared radiation emitted from an occupant can be focused onto a CCD array and analyzed with appropriate pattern recognition circuitry, or software, to determine the position of the occupant. Such a system could be mounted at any of the preferred mounting locations shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> as well as others not illustrated.</p>
    <p num="p-0230">A transmitter/receiver <b>1215</b> shown mounted on the cover <b>1220</b> of the airbag module <b>1216</b> is shown in FIG. <b>21</b>. The transmitter/receiver <b>1215</b> is attached to various electronic circuitry, not shown, by means of wire cable <b>1212</b>. When an airbag <b>1218</b> deploys, the cover <b>1220</b> begins moving toward the driver. If the driver is in close proximity to this cover during the early stages of deployment, the driver can be seriously injured or even killed. It is important, therefore, to sense the proximity of the driver to the cover and if he or she gets too close, to disable deployment of the airbag <b>1218</b>. An accurate method of obtaining this information would be to place the distance-measuring device onto the airbag cover <b>1220</b> as shown in FIG. <b>21</b>. Appropriate electronic circuitry can be used to not only determine the actual distance of the driver from the cover but also his velocity as discussed above. In this manner, a determination can be made as to where the driver is likely to be at the time of deployment of the airbag <b>1218</b>. This information can be used most importantly to prevent deployment but also to modify the rate of airbag deployment. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, for one implementation, ultrasonic waves are transmitted by a transmitter/receiver <b>1215</b> toward the chest <b>1222</b> of the driver. The reflected waves are then received by the same transmitter/receiver <b>1215</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0231">One problem of the system using a sensor <b>1111</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> or sensor <b>1215</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is that a driver may have inadvertently placed his hand over the transmitter/receiver <b>1111</b> or <b>1215</b>, thus defeating the operation of the device A second confirming transmitter/receiver <b>1110</b> is therefore placed at some other convenient position such as on the roof or headliner of the passenger compartment as shown in FIG. <b>22</b>. This transmitter/receiver operates in a manner similar to <b>1111</b> and <b>1215</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0232">A more complicated and sophisticated system is shown conceptually in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> where transmitter/receiver assembly <b>1112</b> is illustrated. In this case, as described briefly above, an infrared transmitter and a pair of optical receivers are used to capture the reflection of the passenger. When this system is used to monitor the driver as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, with appropriate circuitry and a microprocessor, the behavior of the driver can be monitored. Using this system, not only can the position and velocity of the driver be determined and used in conjunction with an airbag system, but it is also possible to determine whether the driver is falling asleep or exhibiting other potentially dangerous behavior by comparing portions of his/her image over time. In this case the speed of the vehicle can be reduced or the vehicle even stopped if this action is considered appropriate. This implementation has the highest probability of an unimpeded view of the driver since he/she must have a clear view through the windshield in order to operate the motor vehicle.</p>
    <p num="p-0233">Information is provided as to the location of the driver, or other vehicle occupant, relative to the airbag, to appropriate circuitry which will process this information and make a decision as to whether to prevent deployment of the airbag in a situation where it would otherwise be deployed, or otherwise affect the time of deployment. One method of determining the position of the driver as discussed above is to actually measure his or her position either using microwaves, optics or acoustics. An alternate approach, which is preferably used to confirm the measurements made by the systems described above, is to use information about the position of the seat and the seatbelt spool out to determine the likely location of the driver relative to the airbag. To accomplish this the length of belt material which has been pulled out of the seatbelt retractor can be measured using conventional shaft encoder technology using either magnetic or optical systems. An example of an optical encoder is illustrated generally as <b>1501</b> in FIG. <b>24</b>. It consists of an encoder disk <b>1502</b> and a receptor <b>1503</b> which sends a signal to appropriate circuitry every time a line on the encoder disk passes by the receptor.</p>
    <p num="p-0234">In a similar manner, the position of the seat can be determined through either a linear encoder or a potentiometer as illustrated in FIG. <b>25</b>. In this case, a potentiometer <b>1601</b> is positioned along the seat track <b>1602</b> and a sliding brush assembly <b>1603</b> is used with appropriate circuitry to determine the fore and aft location of the, seat <b>1610</b>. Naturally, for those seats which permit the seat back angle to be adjusted, a similar measuring system would be used to determine the angle of the seat back. In this manner the position of the seat relative to the airbag module can be determined. This information can be used in conjunction with the seatbelt spool out sensor to confirm the approximate position of the chest of the driver relative to the airbag.</p>
    <p num="p-0235">For most cases, the seatbelt spool out sensor would be sufficient to give a good confirming indication of the position of the occupant's chest regardless of the position of the seat and seat back. This is because the seatbelt is usually attached to the vehicle at least at one end. In some cases, especially where the seat back angle can be adjusted, separate retractors would be used for the lap and shoulder portions of the seatbelt and the belt would not be permitted to slip through the “D-ring”. The length of belt spooled out from the shoulder belt retractor then becomes a very good confirming measure of the position of the occupant's chest.</p>
    <p num="p-0236">The occupant position sensor in any of its various forms can be integrated into the airbag system circuitry as shown schematically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> In this example, the occupant position sensors are used as an input to a smart electronic sensor and diagnostic system. The electronic sensor determines whether the airbag should be deployed based on the vehicle acceleration crash pulse, or crush zone mounted crash sensors, and the occupant position sensor determines whether the occupant is too close to the airbag and therefore that the deployment should not take place.</p>
    <p num="p-0237">A particular implementation of an occupant position sensor having a range of from 0 to 2 meters (corresponding to an occupant position of from 0 to 1 meter since the signal must travel both to and from the occupant) using infrared is illustrated in the block diagram schematic of FIG. <b>27</b>. The operation is as follows. A 48 MHz signal, f<b>1</b>, is generated by a crystal oscillator <b>1801</b> and fed into a frequency tripler <b>1802</b> which produces an output signal at 1.44 MHz. The 1.44 MHz signal is then fed into an infrared diode driver <b>1803</b> which drives the infrared diode <b>1804</b> causing it to emit infrared light modulated at 144 MHz and a reference phase angle of zero degrees. The infrared diode <b>1804</b> is directed at the vehicle occupant. A second signal f<b>2</b> having a frequency of 48.05 MHz, which is slightly greater than f<b>1</b>, is also fed into a frequency tripler <b>1806</b> to create a frequency of 144.15 MHz. This signal is then fed into a mixer <b>1807</b> which combines it with the 144 MHz signal from frequency tripler <b>1802</b>. The combined signal from the mixer <b>1807</b> is then fed to filter <b>1808</b> which removes all signals except for the difference, or beat frequency, between 3 times f<b>1</b> and 3 times f<b>2</b>, of 150 kHz. The infrared signal which is reflected from the occupant is received by receiver <b>1809</b> and fed into pre-amplifier <b>1811</b>. This signal has the same modulation frequency, 144 MHz, as the transmitted signal but now is out of phase with the transmitted signal by an angle x due to the path that the signal took from the transmitter to the occupant and back to the receiver. The output from pre-amplifier <b>1811</b> is fed to a second mixer <b>1812</b> along with the 144.15 MHz signal from the frequency tripler <b>1806</b>. The output from mixer <b>1812</b> is then amplified by the automatic gain amplifier <b>1813</b> and fed into filter <b>1814</b>. The filter <b>1814</b> eliminates all frequencies except for the 150 kHz difference, or beat, frequency in a similar manner as was done by filter <b>1808</b>. The resulting 150 kHz frequency, however, now has a phase angle x relative to the signal from filter <b>1808</b>. Both 150 kHz signals are now fed into a phase detector <b>1815</b> which determines the magnitude of the phase angle x. It can be shown mathematically that, with the above values, the distance from the transmitting diode to the occupant is x/345.6 where x is measured in degrees and the distance in meters.</p>
    <p num="p-0238">The applications described herein have been illustrated using the driver of the vehicle. Naturally the same systems of determining the position of the occupant relative to the airbag apply to the passenger, sometimes requiring minor modifications. It is likely that the sensor required triggering time based on the position of the occupant will be different for the driver than for the passenger. Current systems are based primarily on the driver with the result that the probability of injury to the passenger is necessarily increased either by deploying the airbag too late or by failing to deploy the airbag when the position of the driver would not warrant it but the passenger's position would. With the use of occupant position sensors for both the passenger and driver, the airbag system can be individually optimized for each occupant and result in further significant injury reduction. In particular, either the driver or passenger system can be disabled if either the driver or passenger is out of position.</p>
    <p num="p-0239">There is almost always a driver present in vehicles that are involved in accidents where an airbag is needed. Only about 30% of these vehicles, however, have a passenger. If the passenger is not present, there is usually no need to deploy the passenger side airbag. The occupant position sensor, when used for the passenger side with proper pattern recognition circuitry, can also ascertain whether or not the seat is occupied, and if not, can disable the deployment of the passenger side airbag and thereby save the cost of its replacement. A sophisticated pattern recognition system could even distinguish between an occupant and a bag of groceries, for example. Finally, there has been much written about the out of position child who is standing or otherwise positioned adjacent to the airbag, perhaps due to pre-crash braking. Naturally, the occupant position sensor described herein can prevent the deployment of the airbag in this situation.</p>
    <p num="p-0240"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> is a schematic drawing of one embodiment of an occupant restraint device control system in accordance with the invention. The first step is to obtain information about the contents of the seat at <b>900</b>, when such contents are present on the seat. To this end, a presence sensor can be employed to activate the system only when the presence of an object, or living being, is detected. Next, at <b>902</b>, a signal is generated based on the contents of the seat, with different signals being generated for different contents of the seat. Thus, while a signal for a dog will be different than the signal for a child set, the signals for different child seats will be not that different. Next, at <b>904</b>, the signal is analyzed to determine whether a child seat is present, whether a child seat in a particular orientation is present and/or whether a child seat in a particular position is present. Deployment control <b>906</b> provides a deployment control signal or command based on the analysis of the signal generated based on the contents of the seat. This signal or command is directed to the occupant protection or restraint device <b>908</b> to provide for deployment for that particular contents of the seat.
