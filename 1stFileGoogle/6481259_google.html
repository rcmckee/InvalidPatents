    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading> <p>The present invention relates, in general, to the bending of sheets of material, and more particularly, relates to slitting of the sheet material in order to enable precision bending.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading> <p>A commonly encountered problem in connection with bending sheet material is that the locations of the bends are difficult to control because of bending tolerance variations and the accumulation of tolerance errors. For example, in the formation of the housings for electronics, sheet metal is bent along a first bend line within certain tolerances. The second bend, however, works off of the first bend and accordingly the tolerance errors accumulate. Since there can be three or more bends which are involved to create an enclosure, the effect of cumulative tolerance errors in bending can be significant.</p>
    <p>One approach to this problem is to try to control the location of bends in sheet material through the use of slitting. Slits can be formed in sheet stock very precisely, for example, by the use of computer numerically controlled (CNC) controllers which control a slitter, such as a laser, water jet or punch press. Referring to FIG. 1, a sheet of material <b>21</b> is shown which has a plurality of slits <b>23</b> aligned in end-to-end, spaced apart relation along a proposed bend line <b>25</b>.</p>
    <p>Between pairs of slits are bending webs <b>27</b> which will be plastically deformed upon bending of sheet <b>21</b> and yet hold the sheet together as a single member.</p>
    <p>The location of slits <b>23</b> in sheet <b>21</b> can be precisely controlled so as to position the slits on bend line <b>25</b> within relatively close tolerances. Accordingly, when sheet <b>21</b> is bent after the slitting process, the bend occurs at a position that is very close to bend line <b>25</b>. Since slits can be laid out on a flat sheet of material precisely, the cumulative error is much less in such a slitting-based bending process as compared to one in which bends occur in a press brake with each subsequent bend being positioned by reference to the preceding bend.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, even slitting-based bending of sheet material has its problems. First, the stresses in bending webs <b>27</b>, as a result of plastic deformation and slitting at both ends of webs <b>27</b>, are concentrated. Thus, failures at webs <b>27</b> can occur. Moreover, the slits do not necessarily produce bending of webs <b>27</b> directly along bend line <b>25</b>. Thus, in prior art slitting processes the problem of cumulative error in the bend location has been reduced, but stress concentration and somewhat erratic bending can occur.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide method for precision bending of sheets of material using improved slitting techniques which both reduce stress concentrations at the bend web and enhance the accuracy of the bends.</p>
    <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a precision sheet bending process and a sheet of material which has been slit for bending and which can be used to accommodate bending of sheets of various thicknesses and of various types of materials.</p>
    <p>A further object of the present invention is to provide a sheet bending method which results in a bent product having improved shear loading capacity.</p>
    <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide an method for slitting sheets for subsequent bending, and the sheets themselves, that will accommodate both press brake bend and slit bends, is adaptable for use with existing slitting devices, enables sheet stock to be shipped in a flat condition and precision bent at a remote location without the use of a press brake, and enhances assembly or mounting of components in the interior of enclosures formed by bending of the sheet stock.</p>
    <p>The method for precision bending of sheet material, and the sheet stock formed for such precision bending, of the present invention has other features and objects of advantage which will become apparent from, or are set forth in more detail in, the accompanying drawing and the following description of the Best Mode of Carrying Out The Invention.</p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading> <p>In one aspect, the method for precision bending of a sheet of material of the present invention is comprised, briefly, of the steps of forming a plurality of longitudinally extending slits through the sheet in axially spaced relation in a direction extending along, and proximate to, a bend line to define bending webs between adjacent ends of pairs of the slits; and forming a stress reducing structure at each of the adjacent ends of the pairs of slits. The stress reducing structure can be provided by openings or transversely extending, preferably arcuate, slits formed on the bend line and opening to the longitudinally extending slits. The stress reducing openings have a transverse width dimension which is substantially greater than the transverse width dimension of the longitudinal slits, and the arcuate stress reducing slits are convex in a direction facing the bending webs. A further step of the method is the step of bending the sheet material substantially along the bend line across the bending webs between the stress reducing structures.</p>
    <p>In another aspect, the method of the present invention includes slitting a sheet of material for precision bending which comprises the steps of forming a first elongated slit through the sheet of material along the bend line by forming a pair of proximate, transversely spaced apart, parallel and longitudinally extending, first slit segments connected near a common transverse plane by a transversely extending slit segment; and forming a second elongated slit in substantially longitudinally aligned and longitudinally spaced relation to the first elongated slit. The step of forming the second elongated slit also preferably is accomplished by forming a pair of proximate, transversely spaced apart, parallel and longitudinally extending, slit segments connected near a common transverse plane by a transversely extending slit segment. Thus, instead of one continuous elongated slit, each slit in the pair of slits is formed as a slightly stepped slit proximate a midpoint of the combined length of the slit segments. This structure produces a virtual fulcrum upon bending that can be positioned precisely on the bend line to cause bending of the bending webs more precisely along the bend line. In the most preferred form, the stepped slits are also provided with enlarged end openings so as to reduce stress concentrations at the bending webs.</p>
    <p>The present invention also includes a sheet of material formed for precision bending comprising a sheet having elongated slits which are spaced apart in end-to-end relation and in substantial alignment along the bend line, and stress reducing structures at the ends of the slits to reduce stress concentrations. In the most preferred form the sheet of material further has the slits formed as stepped slits in which proximate, transversely spaced apart, parallel and longitudinally extending, slit segments are connected proximate a transverse intermediate plane by a transversely extending slit segment so that bending occurs at a virtual fulcrum. During bending, between the longitudinally extending slit segments tabs formed by the stepped slits slide on supporting edges of the sheet positioned across the slits from the tabs.</p>

    <heading>BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present method for precision bending of sheet material includes two primary aspects, each of which are capable of being used alone, but which aspects preferably are used together. In one aspect, a stress reducing structure is formed at the ends of the slits to affect a stress concentration reduction in the connecting bending webs, while in another aspect, the slits are laterally or transversely stepped slightly over their length so as to produce bending about a virtual fulcrum. The most preferred method and resulting slitted sheets have both slightly stepped slits and stress reduced structures at the ends of the stepped slits.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 2, a sheet of material <b>31</b> is shown in which the first aspect of the present invention has been employed. A plurality of longitudinally extending slits <b>33</b> are formed along a bend line <b>35</b> in a manner similar to the prior art technique shown in FIG. <b>1</b>. The slits <b>33</b> are axially spaced and extend along and proximate to bend line <b>35</b> (preferably superimposed on the desired bend line) to define bending webs <b>37</b> between adjacent ends of pairs of slits <b>33</b>. In the improved slitting method and resulting sheet, a stress reducing structure is provided or formed at each of the adjacent ends of pairs of slits. Thus, for slits <b>33</b> <i>a </i>and <b>33</b> <i>b </i>enlarged openings <b>39</b> <i>a </i>and <b>39</b> <i>b </i>are formed at the adjacent slit ends. Openings <b>39</b> are each formed on bend line <b>35</b> and open to or communicate with slits <b>33</b>. Openings <b>39</b> <i>a </i>and <b>39</b> <i>b </i>have a transverse width dimension which is substantially greater than the transverse width dimension of slits <b>33</b> <i>a </i>and <b>33</b> <i>b. </i>For example, in an aluminum sheet having a thickness of 0.070 inches and slits with a kerf or slit width dimension of 0.015 inches, openings <b>39</b> can be 0.140 inches in diameter.</p>
    <p>Upon bending of sheet <b>31</b>, the openings <b>39</b> will reduce the stress concentration on bending webs <b>37</b> over that which is produced simply by forming narrow slits as shown in FIG. <b>1</b>. Enlarged openings <b>39</b> will, in turn, give the bent sheet <b>31</b> greater strength along the bend line due to the resultant stress reduction in webs <b>37</b>.</p>
    <p>In the present invention, it is preferable that slits <b>33</b> have a width dimension less than the thickness dimension of the sheet of material, and that the enlarged stress reducing openings <b>39</b> have a width dimension that is greater than the thickness dimension of the sheet of material. Slits <b>33</b> can range from a kerf width dimension of zero to just slightly less than the thickness of the material. When a slitting knife is used, the slits essentially have no, or zero, transverse width dimension since no material is removed from the sheet during slitting. Material is only cut by the slitter and the opposite sides of the slit move back into contact with each other. When a laser or water jet is employed, however, there will be a kerf or slit width dimension that is a result of material being removed. Slits with kerfs are shown in FIGS. 1-3B and <b>8</b>, while no kerfs are shown in FIGS. 3A, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>.</p>
    <p>The most preferred from of stress-reducing opening is to have openings <b>39</b> have an arcuate shape on the side thereof facing the opposite aligned slit. Moreover, the arcuate shape of the opening is preferably centered on the bend line that the stress reducing structure provided by openings <b>39</b> also functions as a bend inducing structure making bending of web <b>37</b> more likely to occur on the bend line <b>35</b>. It is believed that having an opening with corners or an apex facing the adjacent slit is less desirable than a circular or semicircular openings since corners or intersecting planar walls would tend to reintroduce stress concentrations along bend line <b>35</b>.</p>
    <p>A second embodiment of a stress reducing structure is shown in FIG. 3A. A sheet of material <b>231</b> is formed with a plurality of aligned longitudinally extending slits <b>233</b> extending along a bend line <b>235</b>. Slits <b>233</b> are transversely stepped in a manner which will be described in more detail hereinafter.</p>
    <p>Positioned at the adjacent ends of slits <b>233</b> are stress reducing structures <b>239</b>, which in the embodiment of FIG. 3A are provided as transversely extending slits. In the most preferred form of slit-based stress reduction structure <b>239</b> the slits are transversely extending arcuate slits, such as shown by slits <b>239</b> <i>a </i>and <b>239</b> <i>b. </i>As will be seen, these arcuate slits curve back along the respective longitudinally extending slits <b>233</b> to which they are connected. Thus, the stress reducing arcuate slits are convex in a direction facing intermediate bending webs <b>237</b> and <b>237</b> <i>a. </i>Bending webs <b>237</b> are defined by an arcuate notch <b>232</b> at edge <b>234</b> of sheet <b>231</b> and the adjacent arcuate stress reducing slit <b>239</b>, or by pairs of slits <b>239</b> <i>a, </i> <b>239</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
    <p>Stress reducing arcuate slits <b>239</b>, <b>239</b> <i>a, </i> <b>239</b> <i>b </i>also can be seen to preferably be positioned so that the shortest distance between arcuate slits <b>239</b> <i>a, </i> <b>239</b> <i>b, </i>or between a slit <b>239</b> and a notch <b>232</b>, will be located substantially on bend line <b>235</b>. This provides a stress reducing and bending inducing structure which more precisely produces bending along bend line <b>235</b>. Considering arcuate stress reducing slits <b>239</b> <i>a </i>and <b>239</b> <i>b, </i>therefore, it will be seen that longitudinally extending slits <b>233</b> connect with these arcuate slits at a position below bend line <b>235</b> in FIG. 3A, while arcuate slits <b>239</b> <i>a, </i> <b>239</b> <i>b </i>are closest to each other at bend line <b>235</b>.</p>
    <p>For the stepped longitudinally extending slits <b>233</b> on the right side of FIG. 3A, linear transversely extending, stress reducing slits <b>239</b> <i>c-</i> <b>239</b> <i>f </i>are shown. These linear slits are somewhat less preferred in that they are not as effective in insuring bending on the bend line as are the arcuate stress reducing slits.</p>
    <p>It will be understood that stress reducing openings <b>39</b>, <b>39</b> <i>a, </i> <b>39</b> <i>b </i>and stress relieving slits <b>239</b>, <b>239</b> <i>a-</i> <b>239</b> <i>f </i>could be spaced slightly by a thin web from the ends of the longitudinally extending slits <b>33</b> and <b>233</b> and still provide protection against the propagation of stress concentration cracks across bending webs <b>37</b> and <b>237</b>. Thus, a small web is shown between the longitudinal slit end <b>233</b> <i>a </i>and the stress reducing slit <b>239</b> <i>a </i>and slit end <b>233</b> <i>b </i>and transverse slit <b>239</b> <i>d </i>in FIG. 3A, which would essentially fail at the start of bending and thereby lengthen the longitudinally extending slit <b>233</b> so that it is connected with the stress reducing structure slit <b>239</b> <i>a </i>or <b>239</b> <i>d </i>and prevent further stress induced cracking or crack propagation across webs <b>237</b> <i>a </i>and <b>237</b> <i>b. </i>As used herein, therefore, the expression “connected” shall mean a stress reducing structure which opens to the longitudinally extending slit at the start, or during, bending of the sheet, as well as stress reducing structures which are sufficiently close to the longitudinal slits so as to prevent or block crack propagation across the bending web, even if the thin web between the stress reducing structure and longitudinally extending slit does not, in fact, fail.</p>
    <p>A further reduction of stress can be accomplished if opposite ends of the transverse stress reduction slits are provided with enlarged openings, as for example are shown by openings <b>240</b> <i>b </i>and <b>240</b> <i>f </i>on the opposite ends of slit <b>239</b> <i>b </i>and slit <b>239</b> <i>f. </i>Openings <b>240</b> <i>v, </i> <b>240</b> <i>f </i>prevent transverse crack propagation from the ends of the stress reducing slits. While shown only for slit <b>239</b> <i>b </i>and <b>239</b> <i>f, </i>it will be understood that openings <b>240</b> <i>b </i>and <b>240</b> <i>f </i>could be provided at the ends of all of the stress reducing slits.</p>
    <p>A second aspect of the present precision bending invention is illustrated in FIGS. 3A and 3B. In FIG. 3B a sheet of material <b>41</b> is formed with a plurality of slits, generally designated <b>43</b>, along a bend line <b>45</b>. Slits <b>43</b>, therefore, are longitudinally extending and in end-to-end spaced relation so as to define bending webs <b>47</b> between pairs of slits <b>43</b>. Moreover, in FIGS. 3A and 3B, slits <b>233</b> and <b>43</b> are provided with stress reducing structures at ends thereof, namely slits <b>239</b> and openings <b>49</b>, respectively, so as to effect a reduction in the stress concentration in bending webs <b>237</b> and <b>47</b>. It will be understood from the description below, however, that stress reducing structures such as enlarged openings <b>49</b> in FIG. <b>3</b>B and slits <b>239</b> in FIG. 3A, are not required for realization of the benefits of the second aspect of the present invention, as can be seen from the embodiment of FIG. <b>8</b>.</p>
    <p>For slits <b>233</b> of FIG. <b>3</b>A and slits <b>43</b> of FIG. 3B, however, each longitudinally extending slit between the slit ends is laterally or transversely stepped relative to bend lines <b>235</b> and <b>45</b>. Thus, a slit, such as slit <b>43</b> <i>a, </i>is formed with a pair of longitudinally extending slit segments <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> which are positioned proximate to, and preferably on opposite sides of, and substantially parallel to, bend line <b>45</b>. Longitudinal slit segments <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> are further connected by a transversely extending slit segment <b>53</b> so that slit <b>43</b> <i>a </i>extends from enlarged opening <b>49</b> <i>a </i>to enlarged <b>49</b> <i>b </i>along an interconnected path which opens to both of the enlarged openings and includes both longitudinally extending slit segments <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> and transverse slit segment <b>53</b>. Similar longitudinal and transverse slit segments are shown in FIG. 3A only the left two slits <b>233</b> are composed of three longitudinally extending slit segments and two transversely extending slit segments.</p>
    <p>The function and advantages of such stepped slits can best be understood by reference to FIGS. 4A-4D, and the corresponding FIGS. 5A-5C to <b>5</b>A′″-<b>5</b>C′″, wherein the bending of a sheet of material <b>41</b>, such as shown in FIG. 3B is illustrated at various stages. In FIG. 4A, sheet <b>41</b> is essentially slit as shown in FIG. <b>3</b>B. There is a difference between FIGS. 3B and 4 in that in FIG. 3B a kerf width or section of removed material is shown, while in FIG. 4A the slit is shown without any kerf, as would be produced by a slitting knife. The effect during bending, however, is essentially the same and the same reference numerals will be employed as were employed in FIG. <b>3</b>B.</p>
    <p>Thus, sheet <b>41</b> is shown in a flat condition before bending in FIG. <b>4</b>A. Longitudinally extending slit segments <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> are shown in FIG. <b>4</b>A and in the cross sections of FIGS. 5A-5C. The positions of the various cross sections of the sheet are also shown in FIG. <b>4</b>A.</p>
    <p>In FIG. 4B, the sheet has been bent slightly along bend line <b>45</b>, which can best be seen in FIGS. <b>5</b>A′-<b>5</b>′C. As can be seen in FIGS. <b>5</b>A′ and <b>5</b>B′, slits <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> have opened up along their top edges and the portion of the sheet which extends beyond bend line <b>45</b> is referred to herein as “tab” <b>55</b>. The lower or bottom side corners <b>51</b> <i>a </i>and <b>52</b> <i>a </i>of tabs <b>55</b> have moved up slightly along a supporting edge <b>51</b> <i>b </i>and <b>52</b> <i>b </i>of the edges of the sheet on the sides of the slit opposite to tabs <b>55</b>. This displacement of tab corners <b>51</b> <i>a </i>and <b>52</b> <i>a </i>may be better seen in connection with the sheet when it is bent to a greater degree, for example, when bent to the position shown in FIG. <b>4</b>C.</p>
    <p>In FIG. 4C it will be seen that tab corners <b>51</b> <i>a </i>and <b>52</b> <i>a </i>have moved upwardly on supporting edges <b>51</b> <i>b </i>and <b>52</b> <i>b </i>of sheet <b>41</b> on opposite sides of bend line <b>45</b>. Thus, there is sliding contact between tabs <b>51</b> <i>a </i>and <b>52</b> <i>a </i>and the opposing supporting edges <b>51</b> <i>b </i>and <b>52</b> <i>b </i>of the slit during bending. This sliding contact will be occurring at locations which are equidistant on opposite sides of central bend line <b>45</b> if longitudinal slit segments <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> are formed in equally spaced positions on opposite sides of bend line <b>45</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>4</b>A. The result is that there are two actual bending fulcrums <b>51</b> <i>a, </i> <b>51</b> <i>b </i>and <b>52</b> <i>a, </i> <b>52</b> <i>b </i>spaced at equal distances from, and on opposite sides of, bend line <b>45</b>. Tab corner <b>51</b> <i>a </i>and supporting edge <b>51</b> <i>b </i>as well as tab corner <b>52</b> <i>a </i>and supporting edge <b>52</b> <i>b, </i>produce bending of bending web <b>47</b> about a virtual fulcrum that lies between the actual fulcrums and can be superimposed over bend line <b>45</b>.</p>
    <p>The final result of a 90° bend is shown if FIG. <b>4</b>D and corresponding cross sections <b>5</b>′″A-<b>5</b>C′″. As will be seen, the sheet bottom side or surface <b>51</b> <i>c </i>now rests on, and is supported in partially overlapped relation to, supporting edge <b>51</b> <i>b. </i>Similarly, bottom surface <b>52</b> <i>c </i>now rests on surface <b>52</b> <i>b </i>in an overlapped condition. Bending web <b>47</b> has been plastically deformed by extending along an upper surface of the web <b>47</b> <i>a </i>and plastically compressed along a lower surface <b>47</b> <i>b </i>of web <b>47</b>, as best illustrated in FIG. <b>5</b>C′″. In the bent condition of FIG. 4D, the tab portions of the sheet, namely, portions <b>55</b>, which extend over the center line when the sheet is slit, are now resting on supporting edges <b>51</b> <i>b </i>and <b>52</b> <i>b. </i>This configuration gives the bent piece greater resistance to shear forces at the bend in mutually perpendicular directions. Thus a load L<sub>a </sub>(FIG. <b>5</b>A′″) will be supported intermediately bending webs <b>47</b> by the overlap of bottom surface <b>52</b> on supporting edge <b>52</b> <i>b. </i>Similarly, a load L<sub>b </sub>will be supported by overlap of surface <b>51</b> <i>c </i>on supporting edge <b>51</b> <i>b </i>intermediate bending webs <b>47</b>.</p>
    <p>The laterally stepped or staggered slits of the present invention, therefore, result in substantial advantages. First, the lateral position of the longitudinally extending slit segments <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> can be precisely located on each side of bend line <b>45</b>, with the result that the bend will occur about a virtual fulcrum as a consequence of two actual fulcrums equidistant from, and on opposite sides of, the bend line. This precision bending reduces or eliminates accumulated tolerance errors since slit positions can be very precisely controlled by a CNC controller. It also should be noted, that press brakes normally bend by indexing off an edge of a sheet. This makes bending at an angle to the sheet edge difficult using a press brake. Bending precisely at angles to the sheet edge, however, can be accomplished readily using the present slitting process. Additionally, the resulting bent sheet has substantially improved strength against shear loading because the overlapped tabs and edges produced by the stepped longitudinally extending slit segments support the sheet against shear loads.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 6, an alternative embodiment of a piece of sheet material or stock which has been slit in accordance with the present invention is shown. Sheet <b>61</b> is formed with five bend lines <b>62</b>-<b>66</b>. In each case stepped slits are formed along the bend lines and have pairs of longitudinally extending slit segments positioned proximate to and on opposite sides of bend lines <b>62</b>-<b>66</b>. The stepped slits, generally designated <b>68</b>, terminate in D-shaped enlarged openings <b>69</b>, which in turn, define a central bending web <b>71</b> between a pair of slits <b>68</b> and side bending webs <b>72</b> with notches <b>73</b> in opposed edges of sheet <b>61</b>. The arcuate side of the D-shaped openings <b>69</b> reduces stress concentrations in webs <b>71</b> and <b>72</b>, and it can be seen that the outer openings <b>69</b> also cooperate with arcuate notches .<b>73</b> in the sheet edge so that stress concentrations in webs <b>72</b> are minimized.</p>
    <p>Longitudinally extending slit segments <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> are connected by S-shaped transversely extending slit segments <b>77</b>. As was the case for transverse slit segments <b>53</b> in FIGS. 3B and 4, transversely extending slit segment <b>77</b> include a length which is substantially perpendicular to the bend line over a substantial portion of the transverse dimension of segments <b>76</b>. The “S” shape is a result of forming slits <b>68</b> with a laser or water jet using a numeric controller. Such laser and water jet slit cutting techniques are not well suited to sharp corners, and the “S” shape allows transitioning between the longitudinally extending slit segments <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> and a transversely extending slit segment <b>77</b> without sharp corners.</p>
    <p>It is believed that it is highly desirable for the transversely extending slit segment to be substantially perpendicular to the bend line over most of the transverse dimensions so that the tabs formed by the stepped slits are free to engage and pivot off the opposite supporting edge of the sheet of material without interfering engagement of the sheet on opposite sides of the transverse slit segment. Connecting longitudinally extending slit segments <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> by a transverse slit segment <b>77</b> which is at an angle other than 90° to the bend line is illustrated in the far right slit in FIG. <b>8</b> and has been employed, but generally, it results in contact along the transverse slit segment which can affect the location of the virtual fulcrum during the bend. Thus, it is preferred to have the transverse slit segment <b>53</b> or <b>77</b> connect the longitudinal slit segments <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> or <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> at a near perpendicular angle to the bend line so that the virtual fulcrum location is determined solely by engagement of the tab corners on opposite sides of the bend line.</p>
    <p>In FIG. 6, the difference between the slit configurations along bend line <b>62</b>, <b>63</b>, <b>64</b> and <b>65</b> is the transverse spacing of the longitudinally extending slit segments. Thus the spacing is increased from bend line <b>62</b> to the greatest spacing at bend line <b>65</b>.</p>
    <p>At bend line <b>66</b>, the “S” shape has been replaced by a perpendicular transverse segment <b>77</b> which has corners <b>78</b> that are rounded to transition to the longitudinally extending slit segments <b>74</b> and <b>76</b>.</p>
    <p>In each case, it will be seen in FIG. 6 that the transverse slit segment <b>77</b> is located at approximately the midpoint of the combined longitudinal length of slit segments <b>74</b>, <b>76</b>. This is the preferred form for slitting sheet material of the present invention because is results in the tabs, such as tab <b>81</b> and tab <b>82</b> shown at bend line <b>66</b> having substantially the same length dimension along the bend line. Thus, when the lower corners of tabs <b>81</b> and <b>82</b> engage the opposite supporting edges of the sheet material on the opposite side of the slit, the length available for pivoting and sliding engagement will be substantially equal on both sides of the bend line. Bending about a virtual fulcrum between the corners of the two tabs will be more reproducible and precise. It will be understood, however, that transverse slit segments <b>77</b> could be moved along the length of slit <b>68</b> to either side of the center while still retaining many of the advantages of the present invention. In the embodiment of FIG. 8, the far right slit has multiple transverse slit segments which define longitudinal slit segments of differing length. Thus, the transverse slit segments are not evenly distributed along the overall slit length.</p>
    <p>The effect of increasing the lateral spacing of longitudinally extending slit segment <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> relative to the bend line is to tailor the bending as a function of sheet thickness. Generally, as the sheet stock increases in thickness, the kerf of the slit is desirably increased. Moreover, the lateral spacing of the stepped or staggered slit segments also preferably slightly increased. It is desirable to have the longitudinally extending slit segments relatively close to the bend line so that the virtual fulcrum is more accurately positioned.</p>
    <p>As the sheet thickens, however, more plastic deformation and bending of webs <b>71</b> and <b>72</b> is required, and a greater kerf will allow some bending before the lower corners of the tabs begin to engage and slide on the supporting edges of the opposite side of the slit. In this regard, it will be seen from FIGS. <b>5</b>A′″ and <b>5</b>B′″ that tab corners <b>51</b> <i>a </i>and <b>52</b> <i>a </i>slide upwardly along the supporting edges <b>51</b> <i>b </i>and <b>52</b> <i>b </i>to the positions shown in FIGS. <b>5</b>A′″ and <b>5</b>B′″. Thus, the lower corners of tabs <b>81</b> and <b>82</b> also are displaced into contact with the supporting edges on the opposite sides of the tabs, and the lower corners slide during the bending process up to an overlapped position in which underneath sides of the tabs are supported on the supporting edges on the opposite side of the longitudinally extending slit segments.</p>
    <p>In FIG. 7 a further alternative embodiment of a sheet of material which has been slit in accordance with the present invention for precision bending is shown. Sheet stock <b>91</b> has been formed with laterally stepped slits, generally designated <b>92</b>, which terminate in, and open to, hat-shaped stress-relieving enlarged openings <b>93</b>. The openings <b>93</b> can be seen to have a convexly arcuate side <b>94</b> which are centered on bend line <b>96</b>. Extending outwardly from the convex arcuate sides of the openings are lateral extension portions <b>97</b> to give the opening its hat-like shape. Each slit <b>92</b> is comprised of a pair of longitudinally extending slit segments <b>98</b> and <b>99</b> connected by a transverse slit segment <b>101</b>. The longitudinally extending slit segments will be seen to open into openings <b>93</b> at one side or the other of bend line <b>96</b>.</p>
    <p>Both the curved enlarged openings <b>97</b> and the S-shaped transverse slit segment <b>101</b> can be seen to be free of sharp corners so as to permit their formation using laser cutting apparatus or the like.</p>
    <p>During bending of sheet <b>91</b>, the lower corners of tabs <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> again engage supporting edges on the opposite sides of the slit segments from the tabs. These corners slide along the supporting edges to an upward overlapped position, as above described. During this process an area <b>104</b> of bending web <b>106</b>, which is shown in cross hatching at the left side of FIG. 7, will be plastically deformed. Thus, area <b>104</b> between the two convexly arcuate portions <b>94</b> of the hat-shaped openings <b>93</b> will undergo bending that will not resiliently displace back to its original configuration once the bending force has been removed. The areas <b>107</b>, shown in cross hatching at the right end of FIG. 7, between the laterally extending portions <b>97</b> of openings <b>93</b>, however, will be elastically deformed. Thus they will experience bending within the elastic limit and will resiliently be displaced in bending as the sheet is bent. Areas <b>107</b>, however will generally resiliently flatten out once the bending force has been removed. Obviously, webs <b>106</b> at each end of FIG. 7 have both a plastic deformation area <b>104</b> and elastic deformation areas <b>107</b>.</p>
    <p>It has been found that the use of hat-shaped openings <b>93</b> allows the lower tab corners of tabs <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> to remain in sliding contact with the supporting opposite edges as a result of the resilient elastic deformation of areas <b>107</b> of the bending webs <b>106</b>. In order to control the positioning of the virtual fulcrum, is highly desirable that the lower tab corners which engage the opposing supporting edges do not lift up off the opposed supporting edges during bending. Loss of contact can produce virtual fulcrums which are not precisely aligned with the desired bend line <b>96</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 7, slits <b>92</b>, and particularly the longitudinal slit segments <b>98</b> and <b>99</b> and transverse slit segment <b>101</b>, have zero width dimension, which would be the result of formation with a slitting knife. It will be understood that this is only a schematic representation and that slits <b>92</b> can, have a kerf in which material is removed, particularly for thicker sheet stock.</p>
    <p>The embodiment of the second aspect of the present invention illustrated in FIG. 8 includes various slit configurations illustrating the range of slitting principle employed. Sheet of material <b>121</b> includes three slits, generally designated <b>122</b>, <b>123</b> and <b>124</b> which are positioned along a bend line <b>126</b>. Slit <b>124</b> can be seen to be comprised of four longitudinally extending slit segments <b>127</b> which are connected by three transversely extending slit segments <b>128</b>. Each of slit segments <b>127</b> are substantially the same length and are spaced from bend line <b>126</b> on opposite sides thereof by substantially the same distance.</p>
    <p>Slit <b>123</b> is similar to slit <b>124</b> only there are three longitudinal slit segments <b>129</b> connected by two transverse slit segments <b>131</b>. Finally, slit <b>124</b> employs longitudinal slit segments <b>132</b> of differing length and multiple transverse slit segments <b>133</b> which are not perpendicular to bend line <b>126</b>. Moreover, longitudinal slit segments <b>132</b> of slit <b>124</b> are spaced farther from bend line <b>126</b> than the longitudinal slit segments in slits <b>122</b> and <b>123</b>. It also will be seen from FIG. 8 that bending web <b>136</b> between slits <b>122</b> and <b>123</b> is longer along bend line <b>126</b> than bending web <b>137</b> between slits <b>123</b> and <b>124</b>.</p>
    <p>It will be understood that still further combinations of longitudinal and transverse slit segments and spacings from bend line <b>126</b> can be employed within the scope of the present invention. In order to obtain reproducible bends, however, the longitudinal slit segments preferably are spaced equally on opposite sides of the bend line, transverse slit segments are perpendicular to the bend line, and large transverse steps and small webs between adjacent slit ends, for example as exists at web <b>137</b>, are not preferred.</p>
    <p>From the above description it will be understood that the method for precision bending of a sheet material along a bend line of the present invention is comprised of the steps of forming a plurality of longitudinally extending slits in axially spaced relation in a direction extending along and proximate a bend line to define bending webs between pairs of slits. In one aspect of the present method stress reducing structures, such as openings or arcuate slits, are formed at each of the adjacent ends of the pairs of slits to reduce stress. In another aspect of the method of the present invention, the longitudinally extending slits are each formed by longitudinally extending slit segments that are connected by at least one transversely extending slit segment so as to produce a laterally stepped slit that will bend about a virtual fulcrum. The number and length of the bending webs and slits also can be varied considerably within the scope of both aspects of the present invention. An additional step of the present method is bending the sheet of material substantially along the bend line across the bending web.</p>
    <p>The method of the present invention can be applied to various types of sheet stock. It is particularly well suited for use with thin metal sheet stock such as aluminum or steel. Certain type of plastic or polymer sheets and plastically deformable composite sheets, however, also may be suitable for bending using the method of the present invention. The present method and resulting sheets of slit material are particularly well suited for precision bending at locations remote of the slitter. Moreover, the bends may be produced precisely without using a press brake. This allows fabricators and enclosure forming job shops to bend sheets without having to invest in a press brake. Slit sheet stock can also be press brake bent, as well as slit, for later bending by the fabricator. This allows the sheet stock to be shipped in a flat or nested configuration for bending at a remote manufacturing site to complete the enclosure. Press brake bends will be stronger than slit bends so that a combination of the two can be used to enhance the strength of the resulting product, with the press brake bends being positioned, for example, along the sheet edges, or only partially bent to open outwardly slightly so that such sheets can still be nested for shipping.</p>
    <p>The bent product which results has overlapping tabs and supporting edges when stepped slits are employed. This enhances the ability of the product to withstand shear forces. If further strength is required, or for cosmetic reasons, the bent sheet material can also be reinforced, for example by welding the bent sheet along the bend line. It should be noted that one of the advantages of forming both the longitudinally extending slits and arcuate slits with essentially zero kerf, as shown in FIG. 3A, is that the bent sheet has fewer openings therethrough along the bend line. Thus, welding or filling, by brazing epoxy or the like, along the bend line for cosmetic reasons is less likely to be required.</p>
    <p>A further step in the method of the present invention which produces substantial advantages is to mount, secure or assembly components which are to be contained in the eventual bent sheet, for example, in an enclosure, to the sheet material after it is slit, but before it is bent along the bend lines. Thus, while the sheet is flat and slit for bending, or partially bent and slit for further bending, electronic, mechanical or other components can be secured, mounted or assembled to the sheet and thereafter the sheet can be bent along the bend line resulting from slitting. Bending after the components are positioned as desired in the end product allows the equipment enclosure to be formed around the components, greatly simplifying fabrication of the end product.</p>
    <p>Finally, it will be noted that while straight line bends have been illustrated, arcuate bends can also be achieved. Thus, for non-stepped slits, each slit can be arcuate and include a stress reduction structure at the ends. For stepped slits, the longitudinally extending segments can be shortened and curved bends of radii which are not too small can be achieved by laying the stepped short length slits out along the arcuate bend line.</p>
    <p>While the present invention has been described in connection with illustrated preferred embodiments, it will be understood that other embodiments are within the scope of the present invention, as defined by the appended claims.</p>
