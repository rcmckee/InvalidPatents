The apparatus and method includes a fill-up and circulating tool, a cementing head assembly, and a wiper plug assembly. The fill-up and circulating tool comprises a mandrel with a sealing element disposed about the outside diameter of the mandrel. The cementing head and wiper plug assemblies are useable on any fill-up and circulating tool capable of being inserted into a casing. To fill the casing, the assembly is lowered from the rig such that a portion of the fill-up tools inserted into the casing, the pumps are then actuated to flow fluid into the casing. To circulate fluid, the tool is lowered further such that the sealing element sealingly engages the inside diameter of the casing to allow fluid to flow through the casing, into the wellbore, and back to the fluid pumps. To cement the casing, the cement pump and hose assembly is connected to the cementing head to allow cement to be pumped through the fill-up and circulating tool and into the casing string.

No. 5,735,348, issued Apr. 7, 1998. The prior applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF INVENTION</heading> <p>This invention relates generally to equipment used in the drilling and completion of subterranean wells, and more specifically to the filling and circulating of drilling fluids in a casing string as well as pumping cement into the casing to set the casing within the wellbore.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading> <p>The process of drilling subterranean wells to recover oil and gas from reservoirs, consists of boring a hole in the earth down to the petroleum accumulation and installing pipe from the reservoir to the surface. Casing is a protective pipe liner within the wellbore that is cemented in place to insure a pressure-tight connection to the oil and gas reservoir. The casing is run a single joint at a time as it is lowered into the wellbore. On occasion, the casing becomes stuck and is unable to be lowered into the wellbore. When this occurs, load or weight must be added to the casing string to force the casing into the wellbore, or drilling fluid must be circulated down the inside diameter of the casing and out of the casing into the annulus in order to free the casing from the wellbore. To accomplish this, it has traditionally been the case that special rigging be installed to add axial loan to the casing string or to facilitate circulating the drilling fluid.</p>
    <p>When running casing, drilling fluid is added to each section as it is run into the well. This procedure is necessary to prevent the casing from collapsing due to high pressures within the wellbore. The drilling fluid acts as a lubricant which facilitates lowering the casing within the wellbore. As each joint of casing is added to the string, drilling fluid is displaced from the wellbore. The prior art discloses hose assemblies, housings coupled to the uppermost portion of the casing, and tools suspended from the drill hook for filling the casing. These prior art devices and assemblies have been labor intensive to install, required multiple such devices for multiple casing string sizes, have not adequately minimized loss of drilling fluid, and have not been multipurpose. Further, disengagement of the prior art devices from the inside of the casing has been problematic, resulting in damage to the tool, increased downtime, loss of drilling fluid, and injury to personnel.</p>
    <p>The normal sequence for running casing involves suspending the casing from a top drive or non-top drive (conventional rotary rig) and lowering the casing into the wellbore, filling each joint of casing with drilling fluid. The filling of each joint or stand of casing as it is run into the hole is the fill-up process. Lowering the casing into the wellbore is facilitated by alternately engaging and disengaging elevator slips and spider slips with the casing string in a stepwise fashion, facilitating the connection of an additional stand of casing to the top of the casing string as it is run into the hole.</p>
    <p>Circulation of the fluid is sometimes necessary if resistance is encountered as the casing is lowered into the wellbore, preventing the running of the casing string into the hole. This resistance to running the casing into the hole may be due to such factors as drill cuttings, mud cake, or surface tension formed or trapped within the annulus between the well bore and the outside diameter of the casing, or caving of the wellbore among other factors. In order to circulate the drilling fluid, the top of the casing must be sealed so that the casing may be pressurized with drilling fluid. Since the casing is under pressure the integrity of the seal is critical to safe operation, and to minimize the loss of expensive drilling fluid. Once the obstruction is removed the casing may be run into the hole as before.</p>
    <p>Once the casing reaches the bottom, circulating of the drilling fluid is again necessary to test the surface piping system, to condition the drilling fluid in the hole, and to flush out wall cake and cuttings from the hole. Circulating is continued until at least an amount of drilling fluid equal to the volume of the inside diameter of the casing has been displaced from the casing and wellbore. After the drilling fluid has been adequately circulated, the casing may be cemented in place.</p>
    <p>On jobs which utilize a side door elevator, the casing is simply suspended from a shoulder on the elevator by the casing collar. Thus, fill-up and circulation tools with friction fit sealing elements such as packer cups, and other elastomeric friction fit devices must repeatedly be inserted and removed because of the overall length requirements of the tool. This repeated insertion will, over time, result in the wearing of the elastomeric sealing element such that it will no longer automatically seal on insertion. An adjustable extension is disclosed, which allows the fill-up and circulation tool to be retracted to prevent the elastomeric seal from being inserted into the casing during the fill-up process.</p>
    <p>Circulation alone may be insufficient at times to free a casing string from an obstruction. The prior art discloses that the fill-up and circulation tools must be rigged down in order to install tool assemblies to attach to the rig to allow the string to be rotated and reciprocated. This process requires manual labor, inherent in which is the possibility of injury or loss of life, and results in rig downtime. The potential for injury and lost rig time is a significant monetary concern in drilling operations. To eliminate his hazard and minimize lost rig time, a method and apparatus is disclosed, which allows the fill-up and circulation tool to remain rigged up while at the same time allowing the casing to be rotated and reciprocated.</p>
    <p>After the casing has been run to the desired depth it may be cemented within the wellbore. The purpose of cementing the casing is to seal the casing to the wellbore formation. In order to cement the casing within the wellbore, the assembly to fill and circulate drilling fluid is generally removed from the drilling rig and a cementing head apparatus installed. This process is time consuming, requires significant manpower, and subjects the rig crew to potential injury when handling and installing the additional equipment flush the mud out with water prior to the cementing step. A special cementing head or plug container is installed on the top portion of the casing being held in place by the elevator. The cementing head includes connections for the discharge line of the cement pumps, and typically includes a bottom wiper plug and a top wiper plug. Since the casing and wellbore are full of drilling fluid, it is first necessary to inject a spacer fluid to segregated the drilling fluid from the cement to follow. The cementing plugs are used to wipe the inside diameter of the casing and serves to separate the drilling fluid from the cement, as the cement is carried down the casing string. Once the calculated volume of cement required to fill the annulus has been pumped, the top plug is released from the cementing head. Drilling fluid or some other suitable fluid is then pumped in behind the top plug, thus transporting both plugs and the cement contained between the plugs to an apparatus at the bottom of the casing known as a float collar. Once the bottom plug seals the bottom of the casing, the pump pressure increases, which ruptures a diaphragm in the bottom of the plug. This allows the calculated amount of cement to flow from the inside diameter of the casing to a certain level within the annulus being cemented. The annulus is the space within the wellbore between the ID of the wellbore and the OD of the casing string. When the top plug comes in contact with the bottom plug, pump pressure increases, which indicates that the cementing process has been completed. Once the pressure is lowered inside the casing, a special float collar check valve closes, which keeps cement from flowing from the outside diameter of the casing back into the inside diameter of the casing.</p>
    <p>The prior art discloses separate devices and assemblies for (1) filling and circulating drilling fluid, and (2) cementing operations. The prior art devices for filling and circulating drilling fluid disclose a packer tube, which requires a separate activation step once the tool is positioned within the casing. The packer tubes are known in the art to be subject to malfunction due to plugging, leaks, and the like, which lead to downtime. Since each step in the well drilling process is potentially dangerous, time consuming, labor intensive and therefore expensive, there remains a need in the art to minimize any down time. There also remains a need in the art to minimize tool change out and the installation of component pieces.</p>
    <p>Therefore, there remains a need in the drilling of subterranean wells for a tool which can be used for drilling fluid, filling and circulating, and for cementing operations.</p>
    <p>For the foregoing reasons, there is a need for a drilling fluid filling, circulating, and cementing tool which can be installed quickly during drilling operations.</p>
    <p>For the foregoing reasons, there is a need for a drilling fluid filling, circulating, and cementing tool which seals against the inside diameter of a casing having a self-energizing feature.</p>
    <p>For the foregoing reasons, there is a need for a drilling fluid filling, circulating, and cementing tool which minimizes the waste of drilling fluids and allows for the controlled depressurization of the system.</p>
    <p>For the foregoing reasons, there is a need for a drilling fluid filling, circulating, and cementing tool which may be used for every casing size.</p>
    <p>For the foregoing reasons, there is a need for a drilling fluid filling, circulating, and cementing tool which submits additional axial loads to be added to the casing string when necessary.</p>
    <p>For the foregoing reasons, there is a need for a drilling fluid filling, circulating, and cementing tool which is readily adjustable in length such that damage to the sealing element is minimized.</p>
    <p>For the foregoing reasons, there is a need for a fill-up and circulating tool which may be sealingly coupled to a casing string to allow the string to be rotated and reciprocated into the wellbore.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY</heading> <p>The present invention is directed to a method and apparatus that satisfies the aforementioned needs. A drilling fluid filling, circulating and cementing tool having features of the present invention may be utilized on rigs with top drive drilling systems and conventional rotary type rig configurations. The tool may be quickly and easily installed in a top drive or a rotary type rig arrangement. The fill-up and circulating tool of the present invention includes a mandrel having a central axial bore extending therethrough. A top sub assembly which includes a series of threaded couplings and spacers that may be threadedly connected to the upper end of the mandrel to provide proper spacing of the tool within the rigging apparatus. The lowermost portion of the mandrel may include a plurality of apertures which allows drilling fluid to flow from the bore and through the apertures during drilling fluid circulating. A lock sleeve is disposed about the outside diameter of the mandrel, and is positioned to cover the mandrel apertures during the fill-up mode of operation. A retaining spring may be disposed on the outside diameter of the mandrel to bias the lock sleeve between the fill up and circulating positions. An inverted packer cup may be fixedly connected at one end to the outside diameter of the lock sleeve. The opposite end of the cup extends radially outward and away from the outside diameter of the lock sleeve and is adapted to automatically seal against the inside diameter of the casing string when the cup is inserted into the casing. A mud saver valve and nozzle assembly may be connected to the lower end of the mandrel. The mud saver valve is actuated to the open position by increased fluid pressure from above and regulates the flow of fluid from the tool. A nozzle may be attached to the outlet of the mud saver valve to facilitate entry of the tool into the top of the casing string. This configuration is commonly used in a top drive configuration. When the tool is used in a rotary type configuration, a bayonet adapter may be installed on the inlet of the mandrel and is adapted such that fluid may be pumped directly to the tool. The tool may also be configured in a cementing and drilling fluid fill up and circulating arrangement. The cementing and drilling fluid fill up and circulating arrangement includes a cementing head assembly connected to the top of the mandrel. This configuration allows the tool to first be used for drilling fluid fill up and circulating, and then by simply removing the mud saver valve and nozzle and installing the cement wiper plug assembly, common cementing operations may begin for cementing the casing in place. The fill-up and circulating tool of the present invention as well as other such tools, which are capable of being inserted into casing may be configured with a push plate assembly to transfer the weight of the rotary rig assembly and/or top drive to the casing string in order to force the string into the wellbore.</p>
    <p>According to the method of the present invention, when the assembly is utilized for drilling fluid fill up within the casing string, the assembly is first installed on the top drive or rotary type unit and then positioned above the casing to be filled. In on embodiment, the assembly is then lowered until the hose extension is inside of the upper end of the casing string, without engaging the sealing cup with the inside of the casing. In this position the lowermost portion of the mandrel maybe covered by the lock sleeve. The drilling fluid pumps may then be started, which causes the drilling fluid to flow through the assembly and upon generating sufficient fluid pressure will flow through the mud saver valve and out of the nozzle into the casing.</p>
    <p>If a side door elevator is used to raise and lower the casing, full-up and circulation tools which utilize packer cups or other elastomeric friction fit devices must repeatedly be inserted and removed because of the overall length requirements of the tool. A side door elevator is generally used when relatively short strings of casing are being run. The side door elevator does not have slips to engage with the casing string. The side door elevator in the open positions lowered axially over the upper end of the casing string such that the elevator shoulder is underneath the casing collar. The side door elevator is then closed and the top of the side door elevator shoulder is engaged against the bottom surface of the casing collar thereby suspending the casing string from the side door elevator. The problem associated with the use of this type of elevator is the reduced life of the packer cup or elastomeric friction fit sealing device due to wearing against the inside diameter of the casing string. Since the side door elevator is close coupled with the casing collar, due to the required spacing of the fill-up and circulating tool, the packer cup or elastomeric sealing device is always inserted into the casing whether in the fill-up or circulating mode as each joint of casing is added to the string, resulting in repeated frictional engagement of the sealing device with the smaller inside diameter of the casing string.</p>
    <p>The packer, whether a cup or other elastomeric device, wearing problem also occurs when the fill-up and circulation tools is in the tandem configuration. The tandem configuration comprises the use of two different sizes of packer cups or elastomeric sealing devices on a single fill-up and circulation tool to allow different casing sizes to be run without stopping to re-tool. The normal spacing of the tool in the fill-up mode is to position the tool such that the packer is approximately one (1) foot above the top of the casing string. This is not a problem when running smaller casing since both packer cups or elastomeric devices are above the casing. However, when larger diameter casing is run, the lower (smaller diameter) packer cup or elastomeric device is inserted into the casing string such that the upper (larger diameter) packer cup or elastomeric device is approximately 1 foot above the top of the casing string.</p>
    <p>The present invention solves the problems associated with the repeated insertion of a packer cup or elastomeric sealing device into the casing string. An adjustable extension for the fill-up and circulation tool is included, which allows the tool to be retracted to a length such that the sealing devices remain above and outside of the casing string during the fill-up step.</p>
    <p>To begin the drilling fluid circulation mode, the assembly is lowered further into the casing string to cause the sealing element to automatically engage and seal against the inside diameter of the casing, which generally fixes the sealing device cup and sliding sleeve in place with respect to the casing. Further lowering of the assembly causes the mandrel to move axially downward resulting in the mandrel apertures being exposed from the sliding sleeve. On sufficient fluid pressure from the pumps, fluid exits from the tool into the casing through the apertures and through the nozzle. Continued flow of fluid through the tool and into the casing pressurizes the drilling fluid and on sufficient pressurization causes the fluid to circulate from the inside diameter of the casing into and out of the annulus to free or dislodge the casing from the wellbore.</p>
    <p>On occasion circulation alone will not suffice to get past a down hole obstruction. Under these circumstances rotation of the casing string, and/or reciprocation of the casing string may be required to “spud” the casing into the hole. The prior art fill-up and circulation tools had to be rigged down to allow a pup piece or other similar means to be attached to the top drive rig or rotary sub to allow the string to be reciprocated and rotated past the obstruction. The rigging of the fill-up and circulating tools down and up again as well as rigging up and down with the pup piece consumes considerable man-hours and rig time. The present invention offers a solution to this problem. A torque sub in combination with the fill-up and circulation tool is provided, which allows the operator to simply make-up with the coupling on the upper end of the casing with the fill-up and circulation tool remaining connected to the top drive (or rotary sub). To make-up with the casing, the spider slips are engaged against the casing fixing it in position. The elevator slips are disengaged from the casing and the top drive unit is lowered axially over the upper end of the casing to allow the threads on the torque coupling to engage with the threads on the casing coupling. The top drive is simply actuated to rotate the fill-up and circulation tool until the torque sub is threadedly connected to the casing coupling. The operator may not pick-up on the casing string to disengage the spider slips. By placing the weight of the top drive onto the casing, the entire string can then be rotated and reciprocated. The casing can then be lowered further into the wellbore. Once the casing is lowered such that the elevator is in contact with the spider, the bails can be disconnected to allow the top sub to lower the casing even further into the wellbore. The spider slips are then engaged against the casing to fix it at the rig floor. The top drive is simply reversed to disengage the torque sub from the casing coupling, and the bails may be reconnected to the elevator, or if further reciprocation is necessary left uncoupled. Now another joint of casing can be picked up to make up the joint with the casing.</p>
    <p>When the casing is run to the desired depth and drilling fluid filling and circulation is no longer required, the assembly may be configured for the cementing process. The drilling fluid lines are disconnected and replaced with the cement pump lines. After the drilling fluid flow is stopped, the apparatus is withdrawn from the casing to expose the mud saver valve and hose extension assembly. The mud saver valve and hose extension assembly may be simply uncoupled from the lower body of the apparatus and the cement wiper plug assembly installed. The apparatus with the cement plug assembly and cement pump lines installed is then lowered back into the casing. Once the sealing device is automatically engaged with the casing the cementing process begins. The plug release mechanism may be initiated at the appropriate times during the cementing process to release the cement wiper plugs.</p>
    <p>The fill up and circulating tool of the present invention may include a mandrel having an axial bore formed therethrough, a sealing element disposed about the mandrel, and a pressure relief housing functionally connected with the mandrel for allowing fluid to flow from the casing into the tool when the pressure in the casing is greater then the pressure in the axial bore. The pressure relief housing may include a lateral port or aperture formed therethrough. The relief housing may further include a blocking mechanism for such as an elastomeric member or ball and seat for allowing fluid to flow into the tool from the wellbore and preventing fluid flow through the port into the wellbore.</p>
    <p>The present invention may be utilized on top-drive and rotary type rigs. Unlike the prior art devices, this invention permits the same basic tool to be utilized for all casing diameters. The only difference is in the choice of sealing device assembly diameters. Thus, the necessity of having multiple tools on hand for multiple casing diameters is eliminated. This feature is much safer, saves rigging time as well as equipment rental costs for each casing installation. The same basic assembly may be used for cementing the casing within the wellbore, saving again on rigging time and equipment rental. In addition, the assembly may be configured for drilling fluid fill up and circulating only. The prior art does not disclose a single assembly, which may be employed to fill-up and circulate drilling fluid, pressure test casing, and fill-up and circulate cement to set the casing in place.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION</heading> <p>FIG. 1 shows a top drive drilling rig <b>3</b>. FIG. 1 also shows the casing fill up and circulator tool <b>46</b> in the top drive configuration, which is more fully described below. Those skilled in the art will know that suspended from the traveling block <b>1</b> on a drilling rig is a hook <b>2</b>. The top drive unit <b>3</b> is suspended from the hook <b>2</b>. Pressurized fluid is delivered from the drilling fluid pumps <b>8</b> through hose <b>4</b> directly to the top drive unit <b>3</b>. A top sub box connection assembly <b>6</b> is threadedly connected at one end to the top drive pin shoulder <b>5</b> to receive the fill up and circulating tool <b>46</b>. The opposite end of the top sub box connection assembly is threadedly connected to the casing fill up and circulating tool <b>46</b>. A tool catch plate <b>7</b> may be fixed to the top sub box connection assembly <b>6</b> as a stop which will engage against the uppermost portion of the casing if the tool becomes disengaged from the top drive unit <b>3</b>. An elevator <b>14</b> is suspended from bails <b>3</b> <i>a </i>and <b>3</b> <i>b </i>attached to the top drive unit <b>3</b>. It should be obvious to one skilled in the art that a joint of casing <b>32</b> may be positioned under the top drive unit so as to allow the upper end of the casing to be gripped by the elevator <b>14</b>, thereby inserting the fill up and circulating tool <b>46</b> partially inside of the casing <b>32</b>. The casing <b>32</b>, suspended from the elevator <b>14</b> may then be lowered through the rotary table slips <b>10</b> on the drilling rig floor and rotary table <b>11</b> below the rig floor and into the wellbore <b>12</b>. As the casing <b>32</b> is being lowered it may be filled with drilling fluid from the fill up and circulating tool <b>46</b>, the full operation of which is more fully described below. Once the casing <b>32</b> is lowered such that the elevator <b>14</b> is almost in contact with the rotary table slips <b>10</b>, the slips <b>10</b> are then engaged against the casing <b>32</b> to hold it in position above the rig floor to receive the next joint of casing <b>32</b>. The procedure is repeated until the entire casing string has been lowered into the wellbore <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 2 is illustrative of a conventional drilling rig with a rotary type rig assembly with the casing circulating tool installed <b>46</b>. Those skilled in the art will know that suspended from the traveling block on a rotary type rig configuration is a hook <b>2</b>. The hook <b>2</b> includes two ears <b>2</b> <i>a </i>and <b>2</b> <i>b, </i>located on either side of the hook <b>2</b>, and are used to suspend a pair of bails <b>13</b> <i>a </i>and <b>13</b> <i>b </i>and an elevator <b>14</b> below. The lower end of the bails <b>13</b> <i>a </i>and <b>13</b> <i>b </i>are connected to the ears <b>14</b> <i>a </i>and <b>14</b> <i>b </i>of the elevator <b>14</b>. The hook <b>2</b>, also suspends a guide plate <b>15</b> connected by a U-bolt <b>16</b>, which is secured to the guide plate <b>15</b> with nuts <b>16</b> <i>a </i>and <b>16</b> <i>b. </i>The U-bolt <b>16</b> extends through apertures <b>15</b> <i>c </i>and <b>15</b> <i>d </i>in the guide plate <b>15</b>. The bails <b>13</b> <i>a </i>and <b>13</b> <i>b </i>extend through two apertures <b>15</b> <i>a </i>and <b>15</b> <i>b </i>in the guide plate <b>15</b> such that horizontal movement of the bails <b>13</b> <i>a </i>and <b>13</b> <i>b, </i>the elevator <b>14</b>, and the fill up and circulating tool <b>46</b> is limited. The lock block <b>18</b> having a central axial bore is welded at one end to the bottom surface <b>15</b> <i>e </i>of the guide plate <b>15</b>. The lock block <b>18</b> includes at least one aperture <b>18</b> <i>a </i>extending through the wall of the lock block <b>18</b> to receive spring pin <b>18</b> <i>b. </i>Spring pin <b>18</b> <i>b </i>is adapted to releasably extend through the lock block aperture <b>18</b> <i>a </i>and to engage the channel <b>17</b> <i>a </i>in the upper end of the bayonet adapter <b>17</b> on the fill-up and circulating tool <b>46</b>. The spring pin <b>18</b> <i>b </i>is inserted through the aperture <b>18</b> and into the channel <b>17</b> <i>a </i>to retain the bayonet adapter <b>18</b> within the lock block <b>18</b> thereby suspending the fill-up and circulating tool <b>46</b> from the guide plate <b>15</b>. To deliver fluid to the casing, the drilling fluid pump <b>8</b> is activated which discharges drilling fluid into hose <b>4</b>, and into the fill-up and circulating tool through the nozzle <b>17</b> <i>b </i>on the bayonet adapter <b>17</b>, which transports the drilling fluid to the fill-up and circulating tool <b>46</b> and into the casing <b>32</b>. Alternative embodiments of the lock block and bayonet adapter are contemplated by the present invention. For example, lock block <b>18</b> comprises a cylinder with internal threads and the bayonet adapter with a male threaded end so as to be threadedly connect to the lock block. In a second alternative embodiment, lock block <b>18</b> comprises a cylinder with two apertures extending through the wall of the cylinder 180° apart with the cylinder having an outside diameter slightly smaller than the inside diameter of the lock block. The upper end of the bayonet adapter is inserted inside the lock block with the apertures in alignment. A pin would then be inserted through the apertures to retain the bayonet adapter and therefore the fill-up and circulation tool.</p>
    <p>FIG. 3 is illustrative of a torque sub <b>70</b> and a rotational sub <b>80</b>, both or either of which may be used in combination with any fill-up and circulation tool inerrable within a casing string in either a top drive or conventional rotary rig configuration. The torque sub <b>70</b>, the operation and benefits of which are described above, includes three primary components, atop sub <b>71</b>, a lock sub <b>72</b> and a thread adapter <b>73</b>. The inlet of top sub <b>71</b> is threadedly connected to the top drive <b>3</b> (or rotary sub if a conventional rotary rig is used). The outlet of the top sub <b>71</b> is threadedly connected to the inlet of lock sub <b>72</b>. The outlet of lock sub <b>72</b> may then be connected directly to the fill-up and circulation tool selected, or it may be connected to the adjustable extension <b>80</b>. The outlet of top sub <b>71</b> also includes O-ring <b>71</b> <i>a </i>which provides a fluid tight seal against the inlet of lock sub <b>72</b>. Disposed about the lower outer surface of the top sub <b>71</b> and the upper outer surface of the lock sub <b>72</b> is thread adapter <b>73</b>. Thread adapter <b>73</b> includes external threads <b>73</b> <i>a, </i>which allows the assembly to be threadedly connected to the internal threads of a casing coupling. Thus, it will be obvious to one skilled in the art that the outside diameter of the thread adapter <b>73</b> varies with the inside diameter of the particular casing and therefore casing coupling used. Extending from the inside wall of the thread adapter is a shoulder <b>73</b> <i>b, </i>which is in engaging contact with the outside wall on the outlet portion of the lock sub <b>72</b>. Disposed within shoulder <b>73</b> <i>b </i>is a O-ring <b>73</b> <i>c, </i>which provides a fluid tight seal between thread adapter <b>73</b> and lock sub <b>72</b>. Extending laterally through the wall of thread adapter <b>73</b>, near its upper end, are pins <b>74</b>. In the preferred embodiment, four (4) pins <b>74</b> are located approximate 90° apart. Pins <b>74</b> extend past the inside surface of the wall of thread adapter <b>73</b> and extend through a slot <b>71</b> <i>b </i>in the lower end of top sub <b>71</b> such that the end of the pins <b>74</b> engage against the wall of the top sub. This fixes thread adapter <b>73</b> to top sub <b>71</b>. It will now be obvious that as the assembly is rotated by top drive <b>3</b> (or rotary sub) to thread adapter <b>73</b> into the casing coupling, the assembly rotates as a unitary structure. After thread adapter <b>73</b> and the casing coupling have been made-up, elevator <b>14</b> and spider <b>10</b> (FIGS. 1 and 2) may be released allowing the entire casing string to be rotated and/or reciprocated within the wellbore. Since fill-up and circulation tool <b>46</b> is still attached, fluid circulation may be performed as well.</p>
    <p>FIG. 3 also shows the adjustable extension <b>80</b>, the benefits and general operation of which is described above. The adjustable extension <b>80</b> allows a fill-up and circulation tool of any design to be extended and retracted automatically via the top drive <b>3</b> (or a rotary sub) or manually by simply rotating the adjustable extension <b>80</b> in the desired direction. The adjustable extension <b>80</b> may be used in place of or in addition to the top sub assembly or pup piece typically used to space the particular fill-up and circulation tool out on the rig. The adjustable extension <b>80</b> includes a lower adapter <b>84</b>, a upper adapter <b>83</b>, a screw mandrel <b>82</b>, and a extension housing <b>81</b>. The inlet of the upper adapter <b>83</b> includes threads to connect to a torque sub <b>70</b>, a cement head assembly (see FIG. <b>5</b>), or may be connected to the top drive or rotary rig. The outlet of the upper adapter <b>83</b> is threadedly connected to the upper end of extension housing <b>81</b>. An O-ring <b>83</b> <i>a </i>is disposed within the lower outer wall of the outlet of the upper adapter <b>80</b> to provide a fluid tight seal between the extension housing <b>81</b> and the upper adapter <b>83</b>. The lower end of the extension housing <b>81</b> includes a shoulder <b>81</b> <i>a, </i>after which threads <b>81</b> <i>b </i>on the inside wall extend to the end of the extension housing <b>81</b>. Threadedly connected to the lower end of the extension housing <b>81</b> is screw mandrel <b>82</b>. The screw mandrel <b>82</b> includes threads <b>82</b> <i>a </i>substantially along the length of the screw mandrel <b>82</b> so that when the extension assembly is rotated, the screw mandrel moves axially within the extension housing <b>81</b> allowing the tool to be extended or retracted as the need arises. The upper end of the screw mandrel <b>82</b> includes a flange <b>82</b> <i>b, </i>the lower portion of which engages against the shoulder <b>81</b> <i>a </i>of the extension housing <b>82</b> to create a stop when the extension assembly <b>80</b> is fully extended. The upper portion of the flange <b>82</b> <i>b </i>engages against the outlet of the upper adapter <b>83</b> to create a stop when the extension assembly <b>80</b> is fully retracted. Disposed within the outer wall of the shoulder <b>81</b> <i>a </i>are O-rings <b>82</b> <i>c, </i>which provide a fluid tight seal between the screw mandrel <b>82</b> and the extension housing <b>81</b>. Threadedly connected to the outlet of the screw mandrel <b>82</b> is the inlet of the lower adapter <b>84</b>. Disposed within the inside wall of the inlet of the lower adapter is an O-ring <b>84</b> <i>b, </i>which provides a fluid tight seal between the screw mandrel <b>82</b> and lower adapter <b>84</b>. The outlet of lower adapter <b>84</b> is threadedly connected to fill-up and circulation tool <b>46</b>, the cement head assembly <b>47</b>, the torque sub <b>70</b> or other related assembly as the circumstances dictate. At least one slot <b>84</b> <i>a </i>is disposed in the outer wall of the lower adapter <b>84</b>. In order to retract or extend the adjustable extension <b>80</b>, a bar or other suitable member is inserted into the slot and force is applied to the bar to extend or retract the adjustable extension <b>80</b> manually. In order to extend or retract the extension automatically, a bar or other suitable member of sufficient length to engage with the bails when rotated is inserted into the slot. Thus, it will be obvious to one skilled in the art that once the top drive <b>3</b> (or rotary sub) is activated to rotate, the bar will move along with the lower adapter <b>84</b> until the bar engages against the bail. Further rotation will cause the extension assembly <b>80</b> to be retracted or extended.</p>
    <p>FIG. 3<i>a </i>shows the preferred embodiment of fill-up and circulating tool <b>46</b> in the top drive configuration and in the fill-up position. Those who are skilled in the art will know and understand that each component in the flow path includes an inlet and an outlet. The tool consists of a mandrel <b>19</b>, having a central axial bore defining a flow path <b>19</b> <i>a </i>through which fluid flows through the tool. A plurality of apertures <b>19</b> <i>c </i>located near the outlet of mandrel <b>19</b> allow fluid to flow through apertures <b>19</b> <i>c </i>during the circulating mode of tool <b>46</b> as more fully described below. To lengthen mandrel <b>19</b> to space out the tool in any desired length on the rig, a top sub assembly may be connected to the inlet of mandrel <b>19</b>. The top sub assembly may consist of a top sub <b>20</b>, a first spacer <b>21</b>, a connector coupling <b>22</b>, a second spacer <b>23</b>, and a top collar <b>24</b> connected in series thereby extending the overall length of the tool as well as the flow path <b>19</b> <i>a. </i>Any number of couplings and spacers or length of spacer may be used to provide proper spacing on the top drive or conventional rotary rig configuration. Once the spacing requirements have been determined, the top sub assembly is configured with top collar <b>24</b> connected to the inlet of mandrel <b>19</b>.</p>
    <p>A spring <b>25</b> is disposed about the outer surface <b>19</b> <i>b </i>of mandrel <b>19</b>. The upper end <b>25</b> <i>a </i>of spring <b>25</b> is in engaging contact with and below lower surface <b>24</b> <i>a </i>of top collar <b>24</b>. A sliding sleeve <b>26</b> in engaging contact with the lower end <b>25</b> <i>b </i>of the spring <b>25</b> is disposed about the outer surface <b>19</b> <i>b </i>of the mandrel <b>19</b>. A spring stop <b>25</b> <i>c </i>is disposed within the annular space between spring <b>25</b> and outer surface <b>19</b> <i>b </i>of mandrel <b>19</b>. Spring stop <b>25</b> <i>c </i>is included to prevent spring <b>25</b> from being damaged from excessive compression. Spring <b>25</b> biases sliding sleeve <b>26</b> such that in the fill-up mode of tool <b>46</b>, sliding sleeve <b>26</b> covers the mandrel apertures <b>19</b> <i>c, </i>which results in fluid flow exclusively through the outlet of mandrel <b>19</b>.</p>
    <p>The upper end of sliding sleeve <b>26</b> includes a flange portion <b>26</b> <i>a, </i>the upper surface of which is in engaging contact with lower end <b>25</b> <i>b </i>of spring <b>25</b>, and the lower surface of which is in engaging contact with a spacer ring <b>27</b>. The lower surface of spacer ring <b>27</b> is in engaging contact with a thimble <b>28</b>. Thimble <b>28</b> is adapted to retain the upper end <b>29</b> <i>a </i>of the sealing element, packer cup <b>29</b> which may be any type of elastomeric sealing device, against and between the lower surface of thimble <b>28</b> and the outer surface of sliding sleeve <b>26</b> near the upper end <b>26</b> <i>b. </i>While packer cup <b>29</b> is shown as the preferred embodiment of the sealing element, any friction fit sealing device may be used, as well as other sealing devices such as inflatable packers and the like may be used in combination with the features and benefits of sliding sleeve <b>26</b> and the mandrel <b>19</b> described herein.</p>
    <p>Spacer ring <b>27</b> minimizes the potential for deflection of thimble <b>28</b> when subjected to fluid pressure forcing packer cup <b>29</b> and thimble <b>28</b> upward and outward. A lock sleeve <b>30</b> is disposed about the sliding sleeve <b>26</b> and is connected to the lower end <b>26</b> <i>b </i>of sliding sleeve <b>26</b>. The upper end <b>30</b> <i>a </i>of lock sleeve <b>30</b> is in engaging contact with the upper end <b>29</b> <i>a </i>of packer cup <b>29</b> to further retain packer cup <b>29</b> within thimble <b>28</b> and against the outer surface <b>26</b> <i>b </i>of sliding sleeve <b>26</b>. Packer cup <b>29</b> depends downward with respect to the upper end <b>29</b> <i>a </i>of packer cup <b>29</b>, flaring radially outward and away from sliding sleeve <b>26</b> such that it forms a cone which defines an annular space between the inside surface of packer cup <b>29</b> and sliding sleeve <b>26</b>. The outside diameter of the lower end <b>29</b> <i>b </i>of packer cup <b>29</b> is at least equal to the inside diameter of casing <b>32</b>. The lower end <b>29</b> <i>b </i>is further adapted to be inserted into casing <b>32</b> and upon insertion to automatically engage with and to provide a leaktight seal against the inside diameter of casing <b>32</b>. Packer cup <b>29</b> is formed from a flexible elastomeric material such as rubber, however other materials or combination of materials are contemplated by the present invention. For example, in an alternative embodiment, the upper end <b>29</b> <i>a </i>of packer cup <b>29</b> is made of steel while the lower end <b>29</b> <i>b </i>is made of rubber or some other elastomer.</p>
    <p>The outlet of mandrel <b>19</b> is connected to the inlet of a lower body <b>31</b>. The lower body <b>31</b> limits the travel of sliding sleeve <b>26</b> downward. In the fill-up mode of tool <b>46</b>, spring <b>25</b> biases sliding sleeve <b>26</b> downward such that the bottom surface of the sliding sleeve <b>26</b> is in engaging contact with the top surface of lower body <b>31</b>. Lower body <b>31</b> also provides a conduit connection between mandrel <b>19</b> and mudsaver valve <b>34</b>. A guide ring <b>33</b> is connected to and disposed about the outer surface of the lower body <b>31</b>. The guide ring <b>33</b> serves as a guide to center tool <b>46</b> within casing <b>32</b> as it is lowered. The outlet of lower body <b>31</b> is threadedly connected to a mud-saver valve and nozzle assembly.</p>
    <p>The mud saver valve and nozzle assembly includes a mud saver valve <b>34</b>, and a nozzle <b>35</b>. The preferred embodiment comprises a mud saver valve <b>34</b> having threads on the outer surface of the valve inlet and internal threads on the inner surface of the valve outlet. Mud saver valve <b>34</b> is connected to tool <b>46</b> by threadedly connecting the body extension <b>36</b> on mud saver valve <b>34</b> to the inlet of the outlet of the lower body <b>31</b>. In so doing, the body extension and a portion of lower body <b>31</b> define the housing and annular space for mud saver valve <b>34</b> internals. A body seal <b>36</b> <i>a </i>comprising an O-ring is disposed within a channel formed in the outer surface of the upper end of the body extension <b>36</b> to seal against the inner surface of the lower body <b>31</b> outlet and the pressurized fluid from leaking at the connection. Beginning with the mud saver valve <b>34</b> internals at the outlet portion, a choke <b>37</b> is connected to a choke extension <b>38</b> for regulating the flow of fluid from tool <b>46</b>. Choke extension <b>38</b> and body extension <b>36</b> are adapted to retain a plunger spring <b>39</b> within the space defined by a portion of the inner surface of body extension <b>36</b> and the outer surface of choke extension <b>38</b>. A plunger <b>40</b> having a central axial bore is connected to the upper end of choke extension <b>40</b>. Plunger <b>40</b> includes a centrally located protruding annular ring portion <b>41</b>, which is in slidable engaging contact with the inner surface of a valve housing <b>42</b>. A plunger seal <b>40</b> <i>a </i>comprising an O-ring is disposed within a channel formed in the annular ring portion <b>41</b> to provide a leak tight seal against valve housing <b>42</b>. The upper end of plunger <b>40</b> includes a plurality of apertures <b>40</b> <i>b </i>to allow fluid to flow into the bore of plunger <b>40</b> and out of choke <b>37</b>. A plunger tip <b>40</b> <i>c </i>is adapted to provide a fluid tight seal against plunger seat <b>43</b> <i>a. </i>Plunger spring <b>39</b> biases plunger <b>40</b> thereby exerting an upward force on the choke extension <b>38</b> and therefore plunger <b>40</b> so that plunger tip <b>40</b> <i>c </i>engages with and provides a fluid tight seal against the plunger seat <b>43</b> <i>a. </i>Fluid pressure exerted on plunger tip <b>40</b> <i>c </i>will cause plunger spring <b>39</b> to depress, which creates an opening allowing fluid to flow through mud saver valve <b>34</b>, through nozzle <b>35</b> and into casing <b>32</b>. The valve housing <b>42</b> is disposed between and is in engaging contact with the plunger <b>40</b> and the lower body <b>31</b>. A housing seal <b>42</b> <i>a </i>comprising an O-ring is disposed within a channel formed in the outer surface of valve housing <b>42</b> to provide a leak tight seal against lower body <b>31</b>. A seat ring <b>43</b> having a central axial bore is in engaging contact with and disposed within the uppermost interior portion of lower body <b>31</b> and is in engaging contact with valve housing <b>43</b> and upper body <b>37</b>. A lower body seal <b>31</b> <i>a </i>comprising an O-ring is disposed within a channel formed in the lower body <b>31</b> to provide a leak tight seal against the seat ring <b>43</b>. The outlet of a centrally located bore within seat ring <b>43</b> defines the plunger seat <b>43</b> <i>a. </i>The plunger seat <b>43</b> <i>a </i>is adapted to sealingly receive plunger tip <b>40</b> <i>c. </i>The seat ring <b>43</b> further includes a plurality of spring loaded check valves <b>44</b> housed within vertical cavities <b>43</b> <i>b. </i>An aperture <b>43</b> <i>c </i>extends from each of the cavities <b>43</b> <i>b </i>to provide fluid communication between the seal ring bore and cavities <b>43</b> <i>b. </i>When the pressure below the seat ring <b>43</b> exceeds the pressure above seat ring <b>43</b>, fluid will depressure through the check valves <b>44</b> and apertures <b>45</b> until an equilibrium pressure above and below the seat ring <b>43</b> is achieved. The check valves <b>44</b> therefore function as safety relief valves to ensure that high pressure fluid is not trapped below the tool, which could result in tool <b>46</b> being expelled uncontrollably from casing <b>32</b> as it is removed, or in an uncontrolled pressurized flow of fluid from casing <b>32</b> when the tool is removed. It will be obvious to one skilled in the art that the uncontrolled depressurization of fluid could result in significant downtime due to loss of fluid, damage to equipment, and injury to personnel.</p>
    <p>Mud saver valve <b>34</b> also functions as a check valve to actuate open when the fluid pressure reaches a set point pressure of about 300 psig, for example. As the fluid pressure increases above 300 psig, plunger <b>40</b> is depressed against spring <b>39</b> which unseats plunger <b>40</b> from plunger seat <b>43</b> <i>a, </i>which allows fluid to flow through tool <b>46</b> and into casing <b>32</b>. When fluid pressure falls below about 300 psig plunger spring <b>39</b> biases plunger <b>40</b> upward causing plunger tip <b>40</b> <i>c </i>to seat against seat ring <b>43</b>. Thus, mud saver valve <b>34</b> retains fluid that would otherwise be drained and wasted from tool <b>46</b>. The nozzle <b>35</b> is connected to the outlet of the mud saver valve <b>34</b>. Nozzle <b>35</b> is generally conical to facilitate insertion into the casing, and includes an aperture <b>35</b> <i>a, </i>all of which allow fluid to escape from tool <b>46</b> in a substantially laminar flow regime. Several mud saver valve <b>34</b> and nozzle <b>35</b> configurations are contemplated by the present invention. For example, a hose can be connected between mud saver valve <b>34</b> and nozzle <b>35</b>, or a hose may be connected between lower body <b>31</b> and mud saver valve <b>34</b>.</p>
    <p>To begin the fluid filling process, fill-up and circulating tool <b>46</b> is lowered over casing <b>32</b> to be filled. Only the portion of tool <b>46</b> below packer cup <b>29</b> is inserted into casing <b>32</b>. Sealing device <b>29</b> remains above and outside of casing <b>32</b> during the fill-up process. Fill-up of fluid is accomplished by simply activating the pump <b>8</b> to fill and then deactivating the pump <b>8</b> on completion. As the fluid pressure increases within tool <b>46</b>, mud saver valve plunger <b>40</b> is unseated from plunger seat <b>43</b> <i>a </i>and fluid is allowed to flow through fill-up and circulating tool <b>46</b> and into casing <b>32</b> to be filled.</p>
    <p>FIG. 4 shows the preferred embodiment of fill-up and circulating tool <b>46</b> in the rotary type configuration. FIG. 4 shows a bayonet adapter <b>17</b> connected to the first spacer <b>21</b> in place of the top sub <b>20</b> on the top sub assembly. If the top sub assembly is not needed, the bayonet adapter <b>17</b> may be connected directly to mandrel <b>19</b>. The bayonet adapter <b>17</b> includes a fluid hose connection <b>17</b> <i>b, </i>adapted to connect to the fluid hose <b>4</b>, and a cylindrical post <b>17</b> <i>c </i>extending from the top of the bayonet adapter <b>17</b>. The outside diameter of the post <b>17</b> <i>c </i>is slightly smaller than the inside diameter of the lock block so that post <b>17</b> <i>c </i>may be inserted within the bore of the lock block <b>18</b>. The outer surface of the upper end of post <b>17</b> includes channel for receiving a spring pin, which allows fill-up and circulation tool <b>46</b> to be suspended in the rotary rig configuration.</p>
    <p>FIG. 4 also shows fill-up and circulating tool <b>46</b> in the fluid circulation mode. Fill-up and circulating tool <b>46</b>, in the rotary rig configuration, is shown lowered into casing <b>32</b> such that sealing element <b>29</b> is in sealing engaging contact with the inside diameter of casing <b>32</b>. Flow of fluid from pump <b>8</b> will cause the fluid pressure to build up inside of casing <b>32</b> until the hydrostatic pressure is overcome thereby resulting in the desired circulation of fluid from inside casing <b>32</b> into the wellbore <b>12</b>. Packer cup <b>29</b> automatically engages against the inside diameter of casing <b>32</b> as it is lowered therein. Therefore, when circulating fluid is desired (e.g. when the casing is stuck in the wellbore <b>12</b>), further downward force is exerted on tool <b>46</b> by lowering the assembly from traveling block <b>1</b>. This causes spring <b>25</b> disposed about the exterior of mandrel <b>19</b> to become compressed between top collar <b>24</b> and flange portion <b>26</b> <i>a </i>(FIG. 3) on the sliding sleeve <b>26</b>. The downward force causes mandrel <b>19</b> to move vertically downward with respect to sliding sleeve <b>26</b> thereby exposing the lower end of mandrel <b>19</b> and apertures <b>19</b> <i>c </i>formed therethrough. Pressurized fluid from the fluid pump <b>8</b> may now follow the flow path <b>19</b> <i>a </i>through tool <b>46</b> as well as through the apertures <b>19</b> <i>c </i>into the casing <b>32</b>. As casing string <b>32</b> is filled, the fluid pressure inside of the casing increases, which further engages packer cup <b>29</b> against the inside surface of casing <b>32</b>. When circulating is no longer necessary, pump <b>8</b> is simply stopped. This results in plunger <b>40</b> within mud saver valve <b>34</b> re-seating against plunger seat <b>43</b> <i>a, </i>which stops the flow of fluid through nozzle <b>35</b>. Tool <b>46</b> is then withdrawn from casing <b>32</b> by raising the assembly suspended from traveling block <b>1</b> so that the next joint of casing <b>32</b> can be picked up or to prepare tool <b>46</b> for cementing operations.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5 illustrates fill-up and circulating tool <b>46</b> in the cementing configuration. While FIG. 5 shows the preferred embodiment of fill-up and circulating tool <b>46</b> as shown in FIGS. 3, <b>4</b> and <b>7</b>-<b>9</b>, the present invention contemplates and includes fill-up and circulating tools of other embodiments. Thus, the following discussion addresses wherein fill-up and circulating tool <b>46</b> is referenced for illustrative purposes. Further, this configuration may be utilized in either the top drive rig or conventional rotary rig operations. Any fill-up and circulating tool capable of insertion into casing may be quickly and easily switched from a drilling fluid filling and circulating mode of operation to the cementing configuration as shown in FIG. 5 by combining the selected fill-up and circulating tool with cementing head assembly <b>47</b> and wiper plug assembly <b>57</b> of the present invention. The fill-up and circulating tool, in the cementing configuration, is connected to and therefore extends the flow path from a cementing head assembly <b>47</b> to a wiper plug assembly <b>57</b>. Using fill-up and circulating tool <b>46</b> as more fully described above, the cementing configuration comprises a cementing head assembly <b>47</b> connected to first spacer <b>21</b> of the top sub assembly, and a cement wiper plug assembly <b>57</b> in place of mud saver valve <b>34</b> and nozzle <b>35</b>. Since the present invention contemplates and includes fill-up and circulating tools of various other embodiments, other means of attachment to a top drive or conventional rotary type units are contemplated as required by the particular fill-up and circulating tool used in the cementing configuration. Additionally, cementing head assembly <b>47</b> may be directly connected to fill-up and circulating tool <b>46</b>.</p>
    <p>The preferred embodiment of cement head assembly <b>47</b> includes a ball drop coupling <b>48</b>, a ball carrier assembly <b>49</b>, and a ball port <b>50</b> connecting ball drop coupling <b>48</b> to ball carrier assembly <b>49</b> providing a passageway therebetween. Ball carrier assembly <b>49</b> includes a ball carrier mandrel <b>50</b>, which houses a ball carrier <b>51</b> in slidable engagement with the interior surface of the ball carrier mandrel <b>50</b>. The lower surface of the ball carrier <b>51</b> includes a slot (not shown) within which ball stops <b>51</b> <i>b </i>and <b>51</b> <i>c </i>are disposed. Ball carrier <b>51</b> <i>a </i>further includes a large ball seat and a small ball seat within which a large ball <b>52</b> <i>a </i>and a small ball <b>52</b> <i>b </i>are respectively seated. Slidably disposed between large ball seat and small ball seat within slot the ball carrier <b>51</b> is ejector <b>51</b> <i>d. </i>Attached to an upper surface of ball carrier <b>51</b> <i>a </i>is plunger <b>53</b> which extends through an aperture in the upper end of ball carrier mandrel <b>51</b>. Disposed between a lower interior surface of ball carrier mandrel <b>51</b> and a lower surface of ball carrier <b>51</b> <i>a </i>is ball spring <b>54</b>. Threadedly connected to the upper end of ball carrier mandrel <b>51</b> is a pressure housing <b>55</b>. Pressure housing <b>55</b> houses an upper end of plunger <b>53</b> and a plunger spring <b>56</b>. Plunger spring <b>56</b> is disposed between a top surface of plunger head <b>53</b> <i>a </i>and an inside surface on the top of pressure housing <b>55</b>. Plunger spring <b>56</b> biases plunger <b>53</b> against the biasing force applied by ball spring <b>54</b> so that neutral position, designated by line <b>100</b>, ball carrier <b>51</b> is in a position that prevents the release of either of the balls <b>52</b> <i>a </i>and <b>52</b> <i>b </i>through ball port <b>50</b> and into ball drop coupling <b>48</b>. Pressure housing <b>55</b> also includes pressure ports <b>55</b> <i>a </i>and <b>55</b> <i>b </i>through which a pressurization fluid (either gas, e.g. air, or hydraulic fluid) is delivered into pressure housing <b>55</b>. In the preferred embodiment the fluid pressure is supplied by air. Thus, cement head assembly <b>47</b> may be actuated remotely to release the appropriate ball using fluid pressure. To release large ball <b>52</b> <i>a, </i>air pressure in the range of 90-120 psi is delivered to pressure port <b>55</b> <i>a. </i>The fluid pressure forces plunger <b>53</b> and ball carrier <b>51</b> down to a position such that the movement of ejector <b>51</b> <i>d </i>within the ball carrier slot stops on contact with stop <b>51</b> <i>b, </i>the contact of which results in large ball <b>52</b> <i>a </i>being ejected through ball port <b>50</b> and descends into ball drop coupling <b>48</b>. Pressure housing <b>55</b> may be depressurized, which allows the spring biasing forces to overcome the fluid pressure, returning ball carrier <b>51</b> to neutral position <b>100</b>. To eject small ball <b>52</b> <i>b, </i>air pressure is delivered to pressure port <b>55</b> <i>b. </i>The fluid pressure forces plunger <b>53</b> and ball carrier <b>51</b> <i>a </i>upward to a position such that the movement of ejector <b>51</b> <i>d </i>within the ball carrier slot stops on contact with stop <b>51</b> <i>c </i>the contact of which results in small ball <b>52</b> <i>b </i>being ejected through ball port <b>50</b> and descends into ball drop coupling <b>48</b>. Again, pressure housing <b>55</b> may be depressurized, which allows the spring biasing forces to overcome the fluid pressure returning ball carrier <b>51</b> to neutral position <b>100</b>.</p>
    <p>If fill-up and circulating tool <b>46</b> (of FIG. 3<i>a </i>or <b>4</b>) is installed with cementing head assembly <b>47</b> and wiper plug assembly <b>57</b>, it is preferable to keep cement from flowing through mandrel apertures <b>19</b> <i>c. </i>If cement is allowed to flow through mandrel apertures <b>19</b> <i>c, </i>plugging of the apertures as well as erosion may occur. To prevent this, sliding sleeve <b>26</b> must be fixed in place on fill-up and circulating tool <b>46</b> of the present invention so that mandrel apertures <b>19</b> <i>c </i>remain covered during the cementing operation. To accomplish this a set screw <b>25</b> <i>d </i>is disposed within each of a plurality of threaded set screw apertures <b>25</b> <i>b </i>in the outer surface <b>19</b> <i>b </i>of mandrel <b>19</b> near mandrel outlet. Preferably apertures <b>25</b> <i>b </i>are located a minimal distance above spring stop <b>25</b> <i>c </i>to fix sliding sleeve <b>26</b> in a position to cover mandrel apertures <b>19</b> <i>c </i>during the cementing operations. Thus cement will not flow from mandrel <b>19</b> through mandrel apertures <b>19</b> <i>c. </i>It is therefore desirable for the full flow of cement to follow flow path <b>19</b> <i>a </i>so as to ensure proper operation of the ball dropping function, and to prevent plugging or erosion of mandrel apertures <b>19</b> <i>c. </i>One who is skilled in the art will readily perceive other methods for preventing sliding sleeve <b>26</b> from moving upward to expose mandrel apertures <b>19</b> <i>c. </i>For example, a tubular member may be disposed about spring <b>25</b> between top collar <b>24</b> and sliding sleeve <b>26</b> to fix sliding sleeve <b>26</b> in place.</p>
    <p>After the casing string has been run, it must be cemented within wellbore <b>12</b>. After the last casing joint has been filled with drilling fluid, a volume of water or flushing fluid is pumped through the assembly and into the casing. The assembly is then removed from the casing string to be configured for the cementing mode. The fill-up and circulating tool is then uncoupled from the top drive or rotary drive unit. The cementing head assembly <b>47</b> is coupled to the inlet of the tool. In the alternative, the cementing head assembly <b>47</b> may be pre-installed with the fill-up and circulating tool for operation in both the drilling fluid and cementing mode. The next step is to connect wiper plus assembly <b>57</b> to lower body <b>31</b> on fill-up and circulating tool <b>46</b>. First, mud saver valve <b>34</b>, and nozzle <b>35</b> are removed from fill-up and circulating tool <b>46</b>. The wiper plug assembly <b>57</b> is then installed. The wiper plug assembly <b>57</b> comprises a top wiper plug <b>58</b> detachably connected to a bottom wiper plug <b>59</b>. The fill-up and circulating tool is now in the cementing configuration and is then reconnected to the top drive or rotary unit. The next step is to release bottom plug <b>59</b> from wiper plug assembly <b>47</b>. To release bottom plug <b>59</b>, the first of two tripping balls <b>52</b> <i>a </i>must be released from tripping ball chamber <b>50</b>. To release tripping ball <b>52</b> <i>a, </i>pin <b>50</b> <i>c </i>is retracted, which allows ball <b>52</b> <i>a </i>to descend from tripping ball chamber <b>49</b> and through tool <b>46</b>. The first tripping ball <b>52</b> <i>a </i>severs the connection between two wiper plugs <b>58</b> and <b>59</b>, which causes bottom wiper plug <b>59</b> to drop into casing string <b>32</b>. A calculated volume of cement is then pumped through the tool and assembly, which drives bottom wiper plug <b>59</b> down casing string <b>32</b>. As bottom wiper plug <b>59</b> descends the casing string, it wipes mud off the inside diameter of the casing. The cement drives bottom wiper plug <b>59</b> to engage with the float collar (not shown) at the bottom of casing <b>32</b>. After the calculated volume of cement has been pumped, a second tripping ball <b>52</b> <i>b </i>is released from ball dropping pump-in tee <b>49</b>. The second tripping ball severs top plug <b>58</b> from wiper plug assembly <b>57</b> and descends into the casing string. Top plug <b>58</b> is driven down casing <b>32</b> by pumping drilling fluid or other suitable fluid through inlet port <b>48</b> <i>b </i>behind top plug <b>58</b>, which also wipes the cement off the inside of casing <b>32</b>. When sufficient pressure is generated between the two wiper plugs <b>58</b> and <b>59</b>, a diaphragm in bottom wiper plug <b>59</b> is ruptured, which allows the cement between wiper plugs <b>58</b> and <b>59</b> to flow from inside casing <b>32</b> through bottom wiper plug <b>59</b> and into the annulus between casing <b>32</b> and wellbore <b>12</b>. After top plug <b>58</b> has come to rest by engaging against bottom plug <b>59</b>, the discharge pressure on pump <b>9</b> begins to increase, which indicates that casing <b>32</b> has been successfully sealed off from the annulus between casing <b>32</b> and wellbore <b>12</b>.</p>
    <p>The fill-up and circulation tool of the present invention may readily be used in a tandem configuration. The tandem configuration is used when it is desired to run two different diameter casing strings, and has the advantage of eliminating the downtime required to rig up prior art circulation tools. The tandem configuration embodiment comprises the fill-up and circulation tool as described above, however, it includes a second sliding sleeve and packer cup arrangement connected above the first sliding sleeve and packer cup wherein the diameter of the second packer cup <b>29</b> is larger than first packer cup <b>29</b>. This allows for both the larger and smaller diameter casing to be filled and circulated without re-tooling. This arrangement can also be used with other sealing elements such as inflatable packers, and devices that seal against the casing via and interference or friction fit with the casing.</p>
    <p>FIG. 6 is illustrative of a push plate assembly <b>60</b>. During casing operations, it may be necessary to apply a downward force to push casing <b>32</b> into the wellbore. This feature allows the weight of the rig assembly to be applied to the top of the casing through push plate assembly <b>60</b>. While FIG. 6 shows the preferred embodiment of fill-up and circulating tool <b>46</b> as shown in FIG. 3, the present invention contemplates and includes fill-up and circulating tools of other embodiments, including but not limited to those shown in the following figures. Thus, the discussion which follows whereby fill-up and circulating tool <b>46</b> referenced is for illustrative purposes. Further, this configuration may be utilized in either the top drive rig or conventional rotary rig assemblies. The push plate assembly <b>60</b> is located between top collar <b>24</b> and top sub <b>20</b> on fill-up and circulating tool <b>46</b>, and is installed in place of the standard connector coupling <b>22</b>. The push plate assembly <b>60</b> includes a coupling <b>61</b> with a plurality of J-shaped slots <b>62</b> within outer wall <b>63</b> of coupling <b>61</b>. A rotatable plate <b>64</b> is radially disposed about coupling <b>61</b> and is adapted to be fixed about coupling <b>61</b> with plurality of pins <b>65</b>.</p>
    <p>To add load to the casing string, plate <b>64</b> must first be rotated until pin <b>65</b> is engaged within the horizontal portion of J-shaped slot <b>62</b>. This locks plate <b>64</b> within assembly <b>60</b> so that load may then be transferred to the casing string. Spider <b>10</b> is then engaged against casing <b>32</b> to hold the string in place. Elevator <b>14</b> is then released from casing <b>32</b> above the rig floor. The top drive unit <b>3</b> is then lowered by traveling block <b>1</b> until plate <b>64</b> is in contact with the top of the casing string. Elevator <b>14</b> is then attached to casing <b>32</b>, and spider <b>10</b> is released. The casing <b>32</b> is now being held only by elevator <b>14</b>. Further lowering of top drive unit <b>3</b>, adds load (the weight of the rig) to casing string, forcing the string into wellbore <b>12</b>. To disengage and release the load from the rig, spider <b>10</b> is set against casing <b>32</b> to hold the casing string. Traveling block <b>1</b> is then raised about 6 inches to pick up on top drive unit <b>3</b> enough to disengage plate <b>64</b> from the top of casing <b>32</b>. Plate <b>64</b> is then rotated so that pins <b>65</b> are aligned with the vertical portion of the J-shaped slot <b>62</b>. Traveling block <b>1</b> is then lowered about 6 inches to push down on top drive unit <b>3</b> enough to allow elevator <b>14</b> to be released from casing string <b>32</b>. The assembly can now be positioned to receive the next joint of casing <b>32</b> to be added to the string.</p>
    <p>FIG. 7 is a partial cross-sectional view of another embodiment of fill-up and circulating tool <b>46</b> of the present invention. Tool <b>46</b> includes a mandrel <b>19</b> having a bore <b>19</b> <i>a </i>formed therethrough in fluid communication between a top and bottom end, the top end being adapted for connecting to a top sub assembly for connecting to a rotary or top drive as commonly known in the art and as shown in previous embodiments. Cementing apparatus <b>47</b>, <b>49</b> and <b>50</b> may also be connected with tool <b>46</b> of the present invention as shown in FIG. <b>5</b>. Tool <b>46</b> further includes a thimble <b>28</b> and a sealing element <b>29</b> connected about mandrel <b>19</b> for sealing annulus between casing <b>32</b> and tool <b>46</b> when tool <b>46</b> is in the circulating or cementing mode. Tool <b>46</b> further includes a pressure relief housing <b>110</b> connected to mandrel <b>19</b> having a fluid pathway formed therethrough and in fluid connection and continuing fluid pathway <b>19</b> <i>a </i>of tool <b>46</b>. Pressure relief housing <b>110</b> forms at least one lateral aperture or port <b>112</b> which provides a fluid pathway in communication with the mandrel pathway <b>19</b> <i>a </i>for preventing flow from pathway <b>19</b> <i>a </i>into casing <b>32</b> while allowing fluid flow from said casing <b>32</b> through aperture <b>112</b> into pathway <b>19</b> <i>a </i>when pressure in casing <b>32</b> is greater then the pressure within tool <b>46</b> (pathway <b>19</b> <i>a</i>). In a preferred embodiment a mud saver valve <b>34</b> and nozzle <b>35</b> are connected below pressure relief housing <b>110</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 8 is a cross-sectional view of pressure relief housing <b>110</b>. As shown, relief housing <b>110</b> is adapted for threadedly connecting to tool assembly <b>46</b>, however, relief housing <b>110</b> may be welded or be a unitary section of mandrel <b>19</b>. Formed laterally through housing <b>110</b> is an aperture <b>112</b> for allowing fluid to flow into flow pathway <b>19</b> <i>a. </i>A blocking mechanism <b>114</b> is in working connection with housing <b>110</b> to prevent fluid from flowing from pathway <b>19</b> <i>a </i>through lateral aperture <b>112</b> into the casing.</p>
    <p>Blocking mechanism <b>114</b> as shown in FIG. 8 is aback seat check valve assembly having a plug and seat <b>116</b> forming a pathway therethrough, a ball <b>118</b>, and a spring <b>120</b>. Housing section <b>110</b> forms a lip <b>122</b> adjacent the inner opening of aperture <b>112</b>. Disposed inside of aperture <b>112</b> and against lip <b>122</b> is spring <b>120</b> for biasing ball <b>118</b> away from pathway <b>19</b> <i>a </i>and against plug and seat <b>116</b>. As shown in this embodiment, plug and seat <b>116</b> is threadedly connected within aperture <b>112</b> for easy removal in order to replace ball <b>118</b> and spring <b>120</b> when needed. Although plug and seat <b>116</b> is shown threadedly connected to housing section <b>110</b> other modes of connecting to may be utilized such as set screws. It is also contemplated that ball <b>118</b>, spring <b>120</b>, and plug and seat <b>116</b> be constructed as a single assembly.</p>
    <p>With reference to FIGS. 1-8, when the well is in a static condition and pressure inside of casing <b>32</b> is substantially equal to or less then the pressure within tool within pathway <b>19</b> <i>a, </i>ball <b>118</b> is seated against plug and seat <b>118</b> preventing fluid flow from inside the casing through port <b>112</b> back into housing <b>110</b>. When pressure inside casing <b>32</b> is greater then the pressure in pathway <b>19</b> <i>a, </i>ball <b>118</b> is unseated from plug and seat <b>116</b>, allowing fluid to enter pathway <b>19</b> <i>a </i>through port <b>112</b> thereby relieving pressure within casing <b>32</b>. For example, when tool <b>46</b> is in the circulating mode, sealing element <b>29</b> is engagingly disposed within casing <b>32</b>. Fluid is pumped through tool <b>46</b> and ball <b>118</b> is seated against plug and seat <b>116</b> preventing fluid flow through port <b>112</b>. When pump <b>8</b> or <b>9</b> is shut down fluid is allowed to flow from casing <b>32</b> through port <b>112</b> into pathway <b>19</b> <i>a </i>and past sealing element <b>29</b>. In this manner, pressure is equalized across sealing element <b>29</b> allowing tool <b>46</b> <i>a </i>to be removed from casing <b>32</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 9 is a partial, cross-sectional view of another embodiment of pressure relief housing <b>110</b>. As blocking mechanism <b>114</b>, includes an elastomer member <b>124</b> for preventing fluid from pathway <b>19</b> <i>a </i>through port <b>112</b> into the casing when pressure is greater in pathway <b>19</b> <i>a </i>then in the casing. As shown, elastomer member <b>124</b> is an inverted packer cup disposed within pathway <b>19</b> <i>a </i>and across port <b>112</b>. Member <b>124</b> is held in place by a locking ring <b>126</b> connected to the interior of housing <b>110</b>. Many versions of this embodiment are anticipated such as, inversion of a packer cup such as the one shown, an elastomeric flapper attached across port <b>12</b>, use of other deformable material which is biased across port <b>112</b> when pressure in pathway <b>19</b> <i>a </i>is greater then the pressure in casing <b>32</b>.</p>
    <p>In addition it is anticipated that housing <b>112</b> as shown in FIGS. 7-9 may include a port <b>112</b> but not have a blocking mechanism. In this embodiment, fluid may be pumped through tool <b>46</b> and through port <b>112</b>. When pumps <b>8</b> or <b>9</b> are shut off, fluid and pressure is allowed to bypass valve <b>34</b> and enter tool <b>46</b> through port <b>112</b> and relieve the pressure below sealing element <b>29</b>.</p>
    <p>Those who are skilled in the art will readily perceive how to modify the present invention still further. For example, many connections illustrated have been shown as threaded, however, it should be understood that any coupling means (threads, welding, O-ring, etc.) Which provides a leak tight connection may be used without varying from the subject matter of the invention disclosed herein. In addition, the subject matter of the present invention would not be considered limited to a particular material of construction. Therefore, many materials of construction are contemplated by the present invention including but not limited to metals, fiberglass, plastics as well as combinations and variations thereof. As many possible embodiments may be made of the present invention without departing from the scope thereof, it is to be understood that all matter herein set forth or shown in the accompanying drawings is to be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. Accordingly, the foregoing description should also be regarded as only illustrative of the invention, whose full scope is measured by the following claims.</p>
