<heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading> <p num="p-0002">(Not Applicable)</p>
  <heading>STATEMENT RE: FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH/DEVELOPMENT</heading> <p num="p-0003">(Not Applicable)</p>
  <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0004">The present invention relates generally to concrete forming equipment and, more particularly, to a uniquely configured disc dowel system that is specifically adapted to prevent relative vertical movement of adjacently disposed concrete slabs.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">During construction of concrete pavement such as for sidewalks, driveways, roads and flooring in buildings, cracks may occur due to uncontrolled shrinkage or contraction of the concrete. Such cracks are the result of a slight decrease in the overall volume of the concrete as water is lost from the concrete mixture during curing. Typical contraction rates for concrete are about one-sixteenth of an inch for every ten feet of length. Thus, large cracks may develop in concrete where the overall length of the pavement is fairly large. In addition, the cracks may continue to develop months after the concrete is poured due to induced stresses in the concrete.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">One of the most effective ways of controlling the location and direction of the cracks is to include longitudinal control joints or contraction joints in the concrete. Contraction joints are typically comprised of forms having substantially vertical panels that are positioned above the ground or subgrade and held in place utilizing stakes that are driven into the subgrade at spaced intervals. The forms act to subdivide or partition the concrete into multiple sections or slabs that allow the concrete to crack in straight lines along the contraction joint. By including contraction joints, the slabs may move freely away from the contraction joint during concrete shrinkage and thus prevent random cracking elsewhere.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">In one system of concrete construction, forms are installed above the subgrade to create a checkerboard pattern of slabs. A first batch of wet concrete mixture is poured into alternating slabs of the checkerboard pattern. After curing, forms may be removed and the remaining slabs in the checkerboard pattern are poured from a second batch of concrete. Although effective in providing longitudinal contraction joints to prevent random cracking, the checkerboard system of concrete pavement construction is both labor intensive and time consuming due to the need to remove the forms and due to the waiting period between the curing of the first batch and the pouring of the second batch of concrete.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">In another system of concrete construction known as monolithic pour technique, the pour joints are installed above the subgrade in the checkerboard pattern. However, all of the slabs of the checkerboard pattern are poured in a single pour thereby reducing pour time as well as increasing labor productivity. An upper edge of the forms then serves as a screed rail for striking off or screeding the surface of the concrete so that the desired finish or texture may be applied to the surface before the concrete cures. The pour joints, comprised of vertically disposed forms, remain embedded in the concrete and provide a parting plane from which the slabs may move freely away during curing. The pour joints additionally allowing for horizontal displacement of the slabs caused by thermal expansion and contraction of the slabs during normal everyday use.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">Unfortunately, vertical displacement of adjacent slabs may also occur at a joint due to settling or swelling of the substrate below the slab or as a result of vertical loads created by vehicular traffic passing over the slabs. The vehicular traffic as well as the settling or swelling of the subgrade may create a height differential between adjacent slabs. Such height differential may result in an unwanted step or fault in a concrete sidewalk or roadway or in flooring of a building creating a pedestrian or vehicular hazard. Furthermore, such a step may allow for the imposition of increased stresses on the corner of the concrete slab at the joint resulting in degradation and spalling of the slab. In order to limit relative vertical displacement of adjacent slabs such that steps are prevented from forming at the joints, a form of vertical load transfer between the slabs is necessary.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">One system for limiting relative vertical displacement and for transferring loads between slabs is provided by key joints. In key joint systems, the form is configured to impart a tongue and groove shape to respective ones of adjacent slabs. Typically preformed of steel, such a key joint imparts the tongue and groove shape to adjacent slabs in order to allow for contraction and expansion of the adjacent slabs while limiting the relative vertical displacement thereof due to vertical load transfer between the tongue and groove. The tongue of one slab is configured to mechanically interact with the mating groove of an adjacent slab in order to provide reactive shear forces across the joint when a vertical load is place on one of the slabs. In this manner, the top surfaces of the adjacent slabs are maintained at the same level despite swelling or settling of the subgrade underneath either one of the slabs. Additionally, edge stresses of each of the slabs are minimized such that chipping and spalling of the slab corners may be reduced.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">Although the key joint presents several advantages regarding its effectiveness in transferring loads between adjacent slabs, key joints also possess certain deficiencies that detract from their overall utility. Perhaps the most significant of these deficiencies is that the tongue of the key joint may shear off under certain loading conditions. Furthermore, the face of the key joint may spall or crack above or below the groove under load. The location of the shearing or spalling is dependent on whether the load is applied on the tongue side of the joint or the groove side of the joint. If the vertical load is applied on the tongue side, the failure will occur at the bottom portion of the groove. Conversely, if the vertical load is applied on the groove side of the joint, the failure will occur near the upper surface of the slab upon which the load is applied.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">Shear failure of the tongue and groove may also occur due to opening of the key joint as a result of shrinkage of the concrete slab. As the key joint opens up over time, the groove side may become unsupported as the tongue moves away. Vertical loading of this unsupported concrete causes cracking and spalling parallel to the joint. Such cracking and spalling may occur rapidly if hard-wheeled traffic such as forklifts are moving across the joint. Another deficiency associated with key joint systems is related to the size, configuration and vertical placement of the tongue and groove within the key joint. If excessively large key joints are formed in adjacent slabs or if the tongue and groove are biased toward an upper surface of the slabs instead of being placed at a more preferable midheight location, spalls may occur at the key joint. Such spalls occurring from this type of deficiency typically run the entire length of the longitudinal key joint and are difficult to repair.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">Other systems for limiting relative vertical displacement and for transferring loads between adjacent slabs involve methods of placing slip dowels within edge portions of the slabs across a pour joint as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,487,249, 5,678,952, 5,934,821, 6,210,070, 5,005,331, D419,700 and D459,205, each of which is issued to Shaw et al. Each one of these patents discloses various alternatives for installing slip dowels across the pour joint. The slip dowels are typically configured as smooth steel dowel rods that are placed within the edge portions in a manner such that the concrete slabs may slide freely along the slip dowels thereby permitting expansion and contraction of the slabs while simultaneously maintaining the slabs in a common plane and thus prevent unevenness or steps from forming at the joint. However, in order to function effectively, the slip dowels must be accurately positioned parallel within the adjoining concrete slabs. The positioning of the slip dowels in a non-parallel fashion prevents the desired slippage and thus defeats the purpose of the slip dowel system.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">In addition, the individual dowel rods must be placed within one or both of the slabs in such a manner such as to permit continual slippage or movement of the dowel rod within the cured concrete slab(s). Unfortunately, because such slip dowels must be perfectly aligned in order to allow the adjacent concrete slabs to slide freely away from the joint, installation of slip dowels is labor intensive. In addition, slip dowels allow movement of the concrete slabs in one direction only (i.e., normal to the joint) while not permitting any lateral movement of the slabs (i.e., parallel to the joint) which may result in cracking of the slabs outside of the joint. Furthermore, because the dowel rods are extended outwardly from each side of the joint prior to pouring of the concrete and because of their relatively small diameter, the dowel rods present a safety hazard to personnel who may be injured by contact with rough, exposed ends of the dowel rods. Finally, such dowel rods may be accidentally bent as a result of contact with equipment and site traffic during construction resulting in misalignment of the dowel rods and locking of the joint.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">In an effort to alleviate the labor intensive installation and inherently hazardous nature of the above-described slip dowel system as well as allow the slabs to move both normally and laterally relative to the joint, a diamond plate dowel system has been developed for limiting relative vertical displacement and for transferring loads between slabs. The diamond plate dowel system is typically comprised of a pocket former that is attached to a side of a concrete form such as a wooden form. The pocket former is configured such that opposing corners of the diamond plate are aligned with the joint. After pouring the slab on one side of the joint which encases the pocket therein, a diamond shaped plate is inserted into the pocket former immediately prior to pouring the abutting slab on the opposite side of the joint. The diamond plate allows the slabs to move unrestrained both normally and laterally relative to the form as the gap between the slabs opens up. In addition, the diamond pate has increased surface area as compared to dowel placement systems. The surface are of the diamond plate is also oriented as it is widest where the maximum shear and bearing loads are the greatest (i.e., along the joint) and narrowest where the loads on the diamond plate are at a minimum (i.e., away from the joint).</p>
  <p num="p-0016">Unfortunately, the diamond plate dowel system suffers from inherent drawbacks resulting from the relatively sharp interior corners that are formed in one of the slabs by the pocket former. Such sharp interior corner of the slab creates areas of localized stress concentration or stress risers. The sharp interior corners in the concrete frequently result in cracking of the cured concrete due to highly concentrated loads imposed by vehicular traffic such as hard-wheeled fork lifts. When cracks initiating at the sharp corners begin propagating outwardly, the diamond plate may bind inside of the pocket former which inhibits movement of the slab in either a lateral or normal direction relative to the joint. If the diamond plate cannot move within the pocket former, then the slab itself may crack at an accelerated rate.</p>
  <p num="p-0017">As can be seen, there exists a need in the art for a dowel system capable of minimizing relative vertical displacement of adjacent concrete slabs caused by settling or swelling of the subgrade or by vertical loads that may be imposed by vehicular traffic. Furthermore, there exists a need for a dowel system that may be readily installed within adjacent concrete slabs and which is configured to maintain the slabs in a common plane while allowing both lateral and normal movements of the slabs. Finally, there exists a need for a dowel system that may be installed with a minimum of labor and that does not present a safety hazard during installation of forms and pouring of the concrete slabs.</p>
  <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0018">The present invention specifically addresses and alleviates the above-referenced deficiencies associated with dowel systems of the prior art. More particularly, the present invention is a disc dowel system that is specifically adapted to minimize relative vertical displacement of adjacently disposed concrete slabs while allowing relative horizontal movement thereof. The disc dowel system comprises a dowel plate and corresponding pocket former installed at a pour joint between a first concrete pour and a second concrete pour disposed above a subgrade or a substrate. The disc dowel system may further include a positioner bracket for positioning the pocket former within the first pour.</p>
  <p num="p-0019">The dowel plate has a generally rounded shape that is divided into an embedded portion and a slidable portion. The slidable portion is configured to be laterally slidable within the pocket former while the embedded portion is configured to be substantially encapsulated or embedded within the second pour such that it is rigidly affixed therewithin after the concrete cures or hardens. Advantageously, the dowel plate is provided in a generally rounded shape in order to minimize safety hazards to construction site equipment and personnel who may be injured by contact with an otherwise rough, exposed edge of a dowel plate having sharp corners or a dowel rod having exposed ends. Furthermore, the dowel plate may preferably be shaped such that a width thereof is at a maximum adjacent the pour joint where the bearing, shear and flexural stresses are greatest.</p>
  <p num="p-0020">The pocket former has a horizontally-extending interior compartment bounded by a pair of spaced apart, upper and lower former plates defining generally planar, upper and lower inner surfaces. The interior compartment has an open, generally straight side defining a compartment opening. The interior compartment may have an arch-shaped compartment perimeter extending from opposing ends of the straight side such that the interior compartment is generally crescent-shaped. The interior compartment is configured with the spacing between the upper and lower former plates being complementary to a thickness of the dowel plate such that a relatively snug, sliding fit is provided therebetween. In this manner, the pocket former creates a void in the first pour such that the dowel plate may be simply slid into the form until a perimeter of the dowel plate is generally in abutment with the compartment perimeter.</p>
  <p num="p-0021">The embedded portion of the dowel plate is rigidly encapsulated within the second pour and the slidable portion of the dowel plate is slidably disposed within the pocket former such that the dowel plate permits substantially unrestrained relative horizontal movement of the first and second pours in all horizontal directions while restricting relative vertical movement thereof caused by vertical loading. Horizontal movement relative to the pour joint may occur due to uncontrolled shrinkage or contraction of the concrete mixture as water is lost during curing. Vertical loading may be comprised of shear, bearing and flexural loads or any combination thereof caused by settling or swelling of the substrate underlying the first and/or second pours. The vertical loading may also be caused by vehicular or pedestrian traffic passing over the first and second pours.</p>
  <p num="p-0022">The disc dowel system may include a positioner bracket that is mounted to a removable concrete form. The positioner bracket facilitates positioning the pocket former during pouring of the first pour. In certain methods of concrete pavement construction, pour joints are typically formed by using a wooden stud or a sheet metal form as the removable concrete form. Such concrete form is typically staked to the substrate along a desired location of the pour joint. The pocket former is positioned adjacent the concrete form such that the interior compartment is substantially horizontally outwardly extending away from the concrete form. Wet concrete is then poured on a side of the concrete form to create the first pour which encapsulates the pocket former. The concrete form is then removed, exposing a pour face of the pour joint along the first pour with the dowel plate opening formed in the pour face. After the slidable portion of the dowel plate is inserted through the dowel plate opening and into the pocket former, the embedded portion remains exposed on an opposite side of the pour joint. Wet concrete is then poured on the opposite side of the pour joint to create the second pour which rigidly encapsulates the embedded portion of the dowel plate therewithin.</p>
  <p num="p-0023">The positioner bracket includes a vertically-disposed base flange and a horizontally disposed plate portion that extends from the base flange. The base flange is rigidly attachable to the concrete form by a variety of means such as with fasteners. The plate portion of the positioner bracket is configured to be complementary to the interior compartment such that the positioner bracket may slidably receive the pocket former with a relatively snug fit. In this manner, the pocket former is held in a generally horizontal orientation during pouring of the first pour and prior to removal of the concrete form and positioner bracket after which the slidable portion of the dowel plate may be inserted into the interior compartment with the subsequent pouring of the second pour to encapsulate the embedded portion therewithin.</p>

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0030">Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for purposes of illustrating the present invention and not for purposes of limiting the same, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a dowel plate <b>22</b> and corresponding pocket former <b>26</b> of the disc dowel system <b>10</b> of the present invention. The disc dowel system <b>10</b> is installed at a pour joint <b>18</b> between a first concrete pour <b>14</b> and a second concrete pour <b>16</b> disposed above a subgrade or a substrate <b>12</b>, as can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The substrate <b>12</b> may be soil underlying the first and second pours <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. Alternatively, the substrate <b>12</b> may be a metal decking or other surface that is adapted to support concrete.</p>
  <p num="p-0031">As can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the disc dowel system <b>10</b> is comprised of the dowel plate <b>22</b> and the pocket former <b>26</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a series of the pocket formers <b>26</b> are shown encapsulated in the first pour <b>14</b> prior to pouring of the second pour <b>16</b>. The disc dowel system <b>10</b> may further include a positioner bracket <b>62</b> for positioning the pocket former <b>26</b> within the first pour <b>14</b> as is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 5</figref> and as will be described in greater detail below. As can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the dowel plate <b>22</b> has a generally rounded shape that is divided into an embedded portion <b>58</b> and a slidable portion <b>60</b>. The embedded portion <b>58</b> and the slidable portion <b>60</b> may be of substantially equal size and shape. As will be explained in greater detail below, the slidable portion <b>60</b> is configured to be laterally slidable within the pocket former <b>26</b> while the embedded portion <b>58</b> is configured to be substantially encapsulated within the second pour <b>16</b> such that it is rigidly affixed therewithin after the concrete cures or hardens.</p>
  <p num="p-0032">As can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the dowel plate <b>22</b> may advantageously be provided in a generally rounded shape such as in a circular shape in order to minimize safety hazards to construction site equipment and personnel who may otherwise be injured by contact with a rough, exposed edge of a dowel plate having sharp corners or a dowel rod having exposed ends. The dowel plate <b>22</b> may also be provided in a generally elliptical shape. Along these lines, it is contemplated that there are a number of alternative shapes of the dowel plate <b>22</b> that may be used in the disc dowel system <b>10</b> of the present invention. Furthermore, the dowel plate <b>22</b> may preferably be shaped such that a width thereof is at a maximum at a position adjacent the pour joint <b>18</b> where the bearing, shear and flexural stresses are the highest. The dowel plate <b>22</b> may be shaped such that the width thereof is at a minimum at locations furthest from the pour joint <b>18</b> where such stresses are reduced.</p>
  <p num="p-0033">In order to facilitate the transfer of vertical loads across the pour joint <b>18</b> between the first pour <b>14</b> and the second pour <b>16</b>, it is contemplated that the dowel plate <b>22</b> may be fabricated of a load-bearing material having favorable strength properties. In this regard, the dowel plate <b>22</b> may be fabricated from metal plate such as carbon steel plate. A galvanized coating may be included on the dowel plate <b>22</b> in order to provide maximum protection of the metal from exposure to concrete which may otherwise result in corrosion for the embedded portion <b>58</b> of the dowel plate <b>22</b>. Other coatings for the metal plate are contemplated and may include powder coating and epoxy coating. In addition, the dowel plate <b>22</b> may be fabricated from materials other than metal plate such as fiber glass, carbon fiber, Kevlar, or high density polymeric material such as reinforced plastic.</p>
  <p num="p-0034">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the pocket former <b>26</b> has a horizontally-extending interior compartment <b>42</b> bounded by a pair of spaced apart, upper and lower former plates <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> defining generally planar, upper and lower inner surfaces <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> of the interior compartment <b>42</b>. The interior compartment <b>42</b> has an open, generally straight side <b>48</b> defining a compartment opening <b>50</b>. As can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, edges of the upper and lower former plates <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> may be chamfered along the straight side <b>48</b> such that leakage of wet concrete between the pocket former <b>26</b> and the positioner bracket <b>62</b> may be prevented. The interior compartment <b>42</b> may have an arch-shaped compartment perimeter <b>52</b> extending from opposing ends of the straight side <b>48</b> such that the interior compartment <b>42</b> is generally crescent-shaped.</p>
  <p num="p-0035">However, it is contemplated that the interior compartment <b>42</b> may be configured in a variety of alternative shapes with the spacing between the upper and lower former plates <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> being complementary to a thickness of the dowel plate <b>22</b> such that a relatively snug, sliding fit is provided therebetween. For example, it is contemplated that the interior compartment <b>42</b> may be rectangularly shaped with the compartment opening <b>50</b> being sized to receive the dowel plate <b>22</b> therethrough with a minimum gap between edges of the dowel plate <b>22</b> and the compartment opening <b>50</b>. As is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the compartment opening <b>50</b> is preferably aligned with the pour joint <b>18</b> at a pour face <b>20</b> thereof such that a dowel plate opening <b>24</b> is created at the pour face <b>20</b>. In this regard, the dowel plate opening <b>24</b> is coincident with the compartment opening <b>50</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0036">Importantly, the pocket former <b>26</b> is configured to create a void in the first pour <b>14</b> such that the dowel plate <b>22</b> may be simply slid into the form until a perimeter of the dowel plate <b>22</b> is substantially in abutment with the compartment perimeter <b>52</b>. In this regard, the dowel plate <b>22</b> does not penetrate through the pocket former <b>26</b> but preferably is configured to snugly fit therewithin. The pocket former <b>26</b> may be configured with internal removable spacers (not shown) that separate the upper and lower inner surfaces <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> during pouring and curing of the first pour <b>14</b> such that the former plates <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> of the pocket former <b>26</b> resist flexure. In this manner, a spacing between the upper and lower former plates <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> is maintained such that the interior compartment <b>42</b> will not collapse under the pressure of wet concrete.</p>
  <p num="p-0037">As can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the embedded portion <b>58</b> of the dowel plate <b>22</b> is rigidly encapsulated within the second pour <b>16</b> and the slidable portion <b>60</b> of the dowel plate <b>22</b> is slidably disposed within the pocket former <b>26</b>. In this manner, the dowel plate <b>22</b> permits horizontal movement of the first pour <b>14</b> relative to the second pour <b>16</b> while restricting vertical movement of the first pour <b>14</b> relative to the second pour <b>16</b>. Advantageously, the relative horizontal movement includes movement in a direction perpendicular, movement in a direction parallel to the pour joint <b>18</b> as well as horizontal movement in all ranges between the parallel and perpendicular directions.</p>
  <p num="p-0038">Perpendicular movement relative to the pour joint <b>18</b> may occur due to uncontrolled shrinkage or contraction of the concrete mixture as water is lost during curing. However, due to the rounded shape of the dowel plate <b>22</b> and the complementary configuration of the interior compartment <b>42</b> of the pocket former <b>26</b>, the disc dowel system <b>10</b> of the present invention allows substantially unrestrained relative horizontal movement of the first and second pours <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> in all horizontal directions. By allowing the first and second pours <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> to move in horizontal direction along the pour joint <b>18</b>, residual stress accumulations may be reduced which may prevent random cracking of the concrete elsewhere.</p>
  <p num="p-0039">Referring still to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it can be seen that the disc dowel system <b>10</b> (i.e., the pocket former <b>26</b> and the dowel plate <b>22</b>) may be placed at substantially equal intervals along the pour joint <b>18</b>. The dowel plate <b>22</b> may be sized to have a predetermined thickness and longitudinal geometry based upon a predicted vertical loading differential between the first and second pours <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. Such vertical loading may be comprised of shear, bearing and flexural loads or any combination thereof. As was earlier mentioned, such vertical loading may be caused by settling or swelling of the substrate <b>12</b> underlying the first and/or second pours.</p>
  <p num="p-0040">The vertical loading may also be caused by vehicular or pedestrian traffic passing over the first and second pours <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. In order to transfer such vertical loads across the pour joint <b>18</b>, an exemplary dowel plate <b>22</b> may be sized with a plate thickness of about one-quarter inch and a maximum width at the pour joint <b>18</b> of about six inches. For configuration wherein the dowel plate <b>22</b> has a circular shape, the dowel plate <b>22</b> has a diameter of about six inches. Typical spacings between disc dowel systems <b>10</b> may be about sixteen inches from approximate centers of the installed dowel plates <b>22</b> along the pour joint <b>18</b> although it is contemplated that the dowel placement system may be installed at any spacing.</p>
  <p num="p-0041">Referring briefly now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the pocket former <b>26</b> may include a perimeter flange <b>34</b> extending around the pocket former <b>26</b> perimeter and attached to the upper and lower former plates <b>76</b>, <b>78</b>. The perimeter flange <b>34</b> may be integrally formed with the former plates <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> of the pocket former <b>26</b> and may have a generally vertically-oriented cross section with dovetailed or flared upper and lower flange portions <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>. The dovetail or flared configuration of the upper and lower flange portions <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> facilitates the locking of the pocket former <b>26</b> within the first pour <b>14</b> preventing horizontal movement after the concrete cures.</p>
  <p num="p-0042">Referring still to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the pocket former <b>26</b> includes an upper outer surface <b>28</b> and a lower outer surface <b>30</b>. In order to increase the rigidity or stiffness of the former plates <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> such that the interior compartment <b>42</b> may resist flexion under the pressure of wet concrete in the first pour <b>14</b>, each one of the upper and lower outer surfaces <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> may have a pair of spaced apart, former alignment ribs <b>40</b> extending thereacross. The former alignment ribs <b>40</b> may be oriented to extend in a direction generally perpendicular to the pour joint <b>18</b> from the straight side <b>48</b> to the perimeter flange <b>34</b>. As can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the former alignment ribs <b>40</b> may be integrally formed with the former plates <b>76</b>, <b>78</b>. Each one of the former alignment ribs <b>40</b> may have a flared cross section similar in shape to the flared cross section of the upper and lower flange portions <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> of the perimeter flange <b>34</b>. The flared configuration of the former alignment ribs <b>40</b> may aid in locking the pocket former <b>26</b> against vertical movement after the concrete cures.</p>
  <p num="p-0043">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 5</figref>, the disc dowel system <b>10</b> may be configured such that the pocket former <b>26</b> may be installed at the pour joint <b>18</b> by using the positioner bracket <b>62</b> that is mountable to a removable concrete form <b>56</b>. In certain methods of concrete pavement construction, the removable concrete form <b>56</b> is typically comprised of a wooden stud or a sheet metal form. As will be described in greater detail below, such concrete forms <b>56</b> are typically staked to the substrate <b>12</b> along a desired location of the pour joint <b>18</b>. The pocket former <b>26</b> is positioned adjacent the concrete form <b>56</b> such that the interior compartment <b>42</b> is substantially horizontally outwardly extending away from the concrete form <b>56</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0044">Wet concrete is then poured on a side of the concrete form <b>56</b> to create the first pour <b>14</b> which encapsulates the pocket former <b>26</b>. The concrete form <b>56</b> is then removed, exposing the pour face <b>20</b> of the pour joint <b>18</b> along the first pour <b>14</b> with the dowel plate opening <b>24</b> being formed in the pour face <b>20</b>. After the slidable portion <b>60</b> of the dowel plate <b>22</b> is inserted through the dowel plate opening <b>24</b> and into the pocket former <b>26</b>, the embedded portion <b>58</b> remains exposed on an opposite side of the pour joint <b>18</b>. Wet concrete is then poured on the opposite side of the pour joint <b>18</b> to create the second pour <b>16</b> which rigidly encapsulates the embedded portion <b>58</b> of the dowel plate <b>22</b> therewithin.</p>
  <p num="p-0045">In the disc dowel system <b>10</b> of the present invention, the positioner bracket <b>62</b> may be mounted on the concrete form <b>56</b> to aid in positioning the pocket former <b>26</b>. In this regard, the positioner bracket <b>62</b> is configured to hold the pocket former <b>26</b> in a substantially horizontal orientation during pouring and curing of the first pour <b>14</b>. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the positioner bracket <b>62</b> may include a vertically-disposed base flange <b>64</b> and a horizontally disposed plate portion <b>68</b> that extends from the base flange <b>64</b>. The base flange <b>64</b> may be formed as a rectangularly-shaped section of plate configured to be rigidly attachable to the concrete form <b>56</b>. As can be seen, the base flange <b>64</b> may be sized such that peripheral edges thereof do not extend beyond top and bottom edges of the concrete form <b>56</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0046">The base flange <b>64</b> may be disposed in abutting contact with the concrete form <b>56</b> and may be affixed thereto by a variety of means such as with fasteners. Toward this end, the base flange <b>64</b> may include a pair of apertures <b>66</b> extending through the base flange <b>64</b> at opposing ends, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Each one of the apertures <b>66</b> may be sized to permit the passage of a fastener through the base flange <b>64</b> for facilitating the rigid attachment of the positioner bracket <b>62</b> to the concrete form <b>56</b>. Such fasteners may include wood screws or nails that are driven into the concrete form <b>56</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0047">As can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the plate portion <b>68</b> of the positioner bracket <b>62</b> may be sized and configured to be complementary to the interior compartment <b>42</b> such that the positioner bracket <b>62</b> may slidably receive the pocket former <b>26</b> with a relatively snug fit. The pocket former <b>26</b> is extended over the plate portion <b>68</b> to a depth whereat the straight side <b>48</b> is in generally abutting contact with the base flange <b>64</b>. In such a position, a perimeter of the plate portion <b>68</b> is disposed adjacent to the compartment perimeter <b>52</b> of the pocket former <b>26</b>. In this manner, the pocket former <b>26</b> is held in a generally horizontal orientation during pouring of the first pour <b>14</b> and prior to removal of the concrete form <b>56</b> and positioner bracket <b>62</b> after which the slidable portion <b>60</b> of the dowel plate <b>22</b> may be inserted into the interior compartment <b>42</b> with the subsequent pouring of the second pour <b>16</b> to encapsulate the embedded portion <b>58</b> therewithin.</p>
  <p num="p-0048">Referring still to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the plate portion <b>68</b> of the positioner bracket <b>62</b> includes upper and lower exterior surfaces <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>. A pair of spaced apart positioner alignment ribs <b>74</b> may be affixed to or formed on respective ones of the upper and lower exterior surfaces <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>. The positioner alignment ribs <b>74</b> may extend generally perpendicularly from the base flange <b>64</b> to the plate portion <b>68</b> perimeter. The interior compartment <b>42</b> of the pocket former <b>26</b> includes upper and lower inner surfaces <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> which may each have a pair of spaced apart alignment grooves <b>54</b> formed therein. The alignment grooves <b>54</b> may be sized and configured to be complementary to the positioner alignment ribs <b>74</b> such that the positioner alignment ribs <b>74</b> line up with the alignment grooves <b>54</b>. The cooperation of the alignment grooves <b>54</b> with the positioner alignment ribs <b>74</b> facilitates the rigid securement of the pocket former <b>26</b> to the positioner bracket <b>62</b> during pouring of the first pour <b>14</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0049">Regarding the material from which the pocket former <b>26</b> and positioner bracket <b>62</b> may be fabricated, it is contemplated that plastic material may preferably be used. The pocket former <b>26</b> and positioner bracket <b>62</b> may each be separately injection molded of high density plastic material such as polyethylene plastic in order to impart sufficient strength and stiffness to the pocket former <b>26</b> and the positioner bracket <b>62</b>. Alternatively, it is contemplated that the pocket former <b>26</b> and positioner bracket <b>62</b> may each be fabricated from materials such as fiber glass and carbon fiber. The former alignment ribs <b>40</b>, alignment grooves <b>54</b> and perimeter flange <b>34</b>, if included, may also be integrally formed with the pocket former <b>26</b> as a unitary structure by way of injection molding. Likewise, the base flange <b>64</b>, plate portion <b>68</b>, apertures <b>66</b> and positioner alignment ribs <b>74</b> may be integrally formed as a unitary structure of the positioner bracket <b>62</b> in an injection molding process.</p>
  <p num="p-0050">The method of installing the dowel plate <b>22</b> within the pour joint <b>18</b> using the disc dowel system <b>10</b> will now be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref>. As was earlier mentioned, the dowel plate <b>22</b> is installed within the pour joint <b>18</b> between adjacent first and second concrete pours <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, multiple ones of the disc dowel system <b>10</b> of the present invention may be installed along the pour joint <b>18</b> in equidistantly spaced relation to each other. The dowel plate <b>22</b> may be configured complementary to the pocket former <b>26</b>. Initially, the disc dowel system <b>10</b> is utilized by positioning the concrete form <b>56</b> along a desired location of the pour joint <b>18</b>, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The concrete form <b>56</b> is typically supported by stakes that are secured to the substrate <b>12</b> at spaced intervals along the desired location of the pour joint <b>18</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0051">If the disc dowel system <b>10</b> includes a positioner bracket <b>62</b> for facilitating the installation of the pocket former <b>26</b> within the first pour <b>14</b>, the positioner bracket <b>62</b> is secured to the concrete form <b>56</b> by initially placing the base flange <b>64</b> in abutting contact with a side of the concrete form <b>56</b>. The base flange <b>64</b> may be approximately vertically centered on the side of the concrete form <b>56</b> such that the plate portion <b>68</b> extends substantially horizontally outwardly from the concrete form <b>56</b>, as can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Fasteners such as screws or nails may be driven through the apertures <b>66</b> of the base flange <b>64</b> and into the concrete form <b>56</b> in order to secure the positioner bracket <b>62</b> thereto.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">After the positioner bracket <b>62</b> is secured to the concrete form <b>56</b>, the pocket former <b>26</b> is slidably extended over the positioner bracket <b>62</b> until the open straight side <b>48</b> of the pocket former <b>26</b> is in substantially abutting contact with the base flange <b>64</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As was earlier mentioned, edges of the upper and lower former plates <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> may be chamfered such that the upper and lower former plates <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> may be placed in substantially abutting contact with the base flange <b>64</b> along the compartment opening <b>50</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0053">The chamfered edges of the upper and lower former plates <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> may prevent leakage of wet concrete between the pocket former <b>26</b> and the positioner bracket <b>62</b> which may otherwise hinder the removal of the positioner bracket <b>62</b> from the pocket former <b>26</b> after the concrete has cured or hardened. If positioner alignment ribs <b>74</b> and complementary alignment grooves <b>54</b> are included with respective ones of the positioner bracket <b>62</b> and the pocket former <b>26</b> as is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the positioner alignment ribs <b>74</b> are aligned with the alignment grooves <b>54</b> as the pocket former <b>26</b> is slidably extended over the positioner bracket <b>62</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">After the pocket former <b>26</b> is slidably extended over the positioner bracket <b>62</b>, the first pour <b>14</b> of concrete is made about the pocket former <b>26</b> such that the pocket former <b>26</b> is rigidly encapsulated therewithin, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The bond between the concrete of the first pour <b>14</b> and the pocket former <b>26</b> may be enhanced if the former alignment ribs <b>40</b> and the perimeter flange <b>34</b> are included with the pocket former <b>26</b>, as is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0055">Subsequent to curing and hardening of the first pour <b>14</b> of concrete, the concrete form <b>56</b> is stripped away from the first pour <b>14</b>, exposing the pour face <b>20</b> of the pour joint <b>18</b>. The stripping away of the concrete form <b>56</b> also causes the positioner bracket <b>62</b> to be removed from within the pocket former <b>26</b>. The positioner bracket <b>62</b> remains in rigid attachment to the concrete form <b>56</b>. Separating the positioner bracket <b>62</b> from the concrete form <b>56</b> may allow multiple uses of the positioner bracket <b>62</b>. Removal of the concrete form <b>56</b> exposes the dowel plate opening <b>24</b> in the pour face <b>20</b> of the pour joint <b>18</b>, as may be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">After the concrete form <b>56</b> and the positioner bracket <b>62</b> are removed and the concrete has cured and hardened, the slidable portion <b>60</b> of the dowel plate <b>22</b> may be inserted through the dowel plate openings and into the interior compartment <b>42</b> of the pocket former <b>26</b> leaving the embedded portion <b>58</b> exposed on an opposite side of the pour joint <b>18</b>. The dowel plate <b>22</b> may be sized and configured to be complementary to the interior compartment <b>42</b> such that a relatively snug, sliding fit is provided between the dowel plate <b>22</b> and the pocket former <b>26</b>. In this manner, vertical play or looseness between the dowel plate <b>22</b> and the interior compartment <b>42</b> may be minimized such that vertical loads may be effectively transferred across the pour joint <b>18</b> between the first and second pours <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> in order to maintain a common plane therebetween.</p>
  <p num="p-0057">After the dowel plate <b>22</b> is inserted into the pocket former <b>26</b>, the second pour <b>16</b> of concrete is made such that the embedded portion <b>58</b> of the dowel plate <b>22</b> is rigidly encapsulated therewithin with the slidable portion <b>60</b> being slidably disposed within the pocket former <b>26</b>. Due to the snug fit between the dowel plate <b>22</b> and the pocket former <b>26</b>, the concrete of the second pour <b>16</b> is prevented from seeping into the interior compartment <b>42</b> of the pocket former <b>26</b> which may otherwise cause the dowel plate <b>22</b> to bond to the pocket former <b>26</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0058">Additional modifications and improvements of the present invention may also be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.
