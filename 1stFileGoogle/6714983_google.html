A communication processor converts data received by the communication transceivers to a predetermined format for a base module and converts data in a predetermined format from the base module to a format for transmission by a selected one of the first and second communication transceivers, thereby isolating the base module from differing characteristics of the transceivers. The communication processor is arranged to relay communications received by one transceiver for re-transmission by the other transceiver and to transfer communications from one subnetwork to the other, without activating the base module.</div>

The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>This invention relates generally to portable data collection and processing terminals for use in a Radio Frequency (RF) communication network, and, more specifically to portable terminals supporting a variety of RF transceivers and associated antenna systems. Additionally, this invention relates to methods in which a portable terminal gains access to the RF communication network.</p>
    <p>In particular, portable data processing terminals have taken on an increasingly significant role in business environments. For example, battery powered, hand-held data collection terminals are used extensively for inventory control in warehousing and merchandising operations. Other uses of such terminals include invoicing, delivery route management, order taking and return control operations—as might be found in automobile rental operations.</p>
    <p>In many business environments, portable data processing terminals often need to communicate in real-time with other portable terminals, peripheral devices, work stations, and host computers. To meet such communication needs, a variety of mixed hard-wired and wireless communication networks with associated communication protocols have been developed, each addressing the specific requirements of a given business environment. In the process of such development, portable terminals have undergone tailoring of both hardware and software to fully support a specific communication network and associated protocol.</p>
    <p>As a result of such tailoring, each type of portable data collection terminal is generally capable of operating in a single type of business environment. Tailoring also results in unreasonable additional costs associated with developing, manufacturing, documenting, etc., each variety of portable data collection terminals.</p>
    <p>More specifically, each portable data collection terminal includes a built-in radio transceiver. The built-in transceiver operates pursuant to one of a variety of types of RF (Radio Frequency) communication characteristics, characteristics that are directed per FCC (Federal Communication Commission) specification.</p>
    <p>The choice of the type of radio transceiver, i.e., the type of RF communication characteristics, to build-in is based on the nature of the business application. For example, a digital cellular radio might be chosen in a environment having great distances between the radio and the destination transceiver. Similarly, data might be exchanged using a single channel UHF (Ultra-High Frequency), direct-sequence spread-spectrum, or frequency-hopping spread-spectrum band. Each of these bands has particular characteristics which make it attractive to a given business environment, and each generally requires a different transceiver.</p>
    <p>After choosing the appropriate radio transceiver, an appropriate antenna is also selected. Each type of transceiver often requires a different type of antenna based on the corresponding RF communication characteristics, the shape of the portable terminal, and the business environment at issue.</p>
    <p>Thus, there is need to provide a portable data collection terminal capable of easily supporting any of a plurality of types of radio transceivers and associated antennas, minimizing needed modifications to the terminal's hardware and software design.</p>
    <p>As technical miniaturization has developed in the electronics industry, computers have been designed with smaller parts, and smaller peripherals. Entire peripherals have been incorporated into modules that connect to the computer. By incorporating functions into modules, computers have been designed with only basic functions, thus making the computer smaller, more efficient, and requiring less power. Custom and application-specific functions have thus been incorporated into the modules to be connected to the computer.</p>
    <p>Modules have become so common that standards have been implemented to insure compatibility between modules and computers. The most popular of these standards is the Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) standard, which sets forth a number of roughly credit card sized module configurations for use in various computers. These cards have become so popular that most portable computers are equipped with at least one PCMCIA card slot.</p>
    <p>Modular cards can be used in a great variety of ways. PCMCIA cards may contain additional memory or storage, or implement communications or other peripheral functions. Communications supported by computer modules may include wired connection, such as over phone lines for a modem or through a wired local area network (LAN), and wireless communication such as a wireless LAN, a wide area network (WAN), or infrared. However, the number of peripheral functions that can be implemented with a single computer device has been limited in the prior art by the number of module slots supported by the computer. For example, a computer with only one card slot can only implement one peripheral function at a time. Even a computer device with more than one card slot is limited in its implementation of multiple peripheral functions. Interfacing between peripheral functions can only be done within the computer device itself, not by the card modules, since they are plugged into completely different slots and therefore are not directly interfaced together. Even when the computer accommodates interfacing between two different cards, additional processor power is required from the computer device, which is undesirable in many portable applications. Therefore, there is a need for a multipurpose computer module that can provide more than one peripheral function and control switching between those functions in a single module.</p>
    <p>In addition, to support real-time access to a communication network, each portable data collection terminal needs to establish and maintain radio connectivity to the network. However, portable terminals must also address conflicting concerns of battery power conservation, i.e., maintaining connectivity places a substantial load on battery power. Moreover, the mobile nature of portable terminals also presents difficulties in maintaining connectivity. It would therefore be desirable to implement communication protocol techniques which address power saving and mobility concerns while providing virtually real-time access to the communication link.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>A communication module for use with a portable data terminal according to the present invention comprises at least two communication transceivers having different operating characteristics for conducting data communications on a different subnetworks. As used herein, a “transceiver” refers to a device for transmitting and receiving any type of communicative energy, including but not limited to wired and wireless communication such as radio frequency, wired network communication, and infrared. A communication processor converts data received by the communication transceivers to a predetermined format and converts data in a predetermined format to a format for transmission by a selected one of the first and second communication transceivers.</p>
    <p>In a preferred form of the invention, one of the communication transceivers is a wired transceiver and another of the communication transceivers is a wireless transceiver so that one of the subnetworks is a wired subnetwork and another of the subnetworks is a wireless subnetwork.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of the invention, the communication processor is able to relay communications received by one transceiver for re-transmission by another transceiver to transfer communications from one subnetwork to another.</p>
    <p>In another embodiment of the invention, the communication processor includes means for initiating a test communication by the wireless communication transceiver, and means responsive to the absence of receipt of a reply test communication by the wired transceiver following initiation of a test communication by the wireless communication transceiver for conducting data communications with the wireless communication transceiver. This embodiment is particularly useful in testing the wired subnetwork by initiating a test communication from the wireless transceiver to a host computer which returns a reply test communication on the wired subnetwork.</p>
    <p>The present invention is also realized in a portable data collection terminal that operates in a communication network having a first and second subnetwork. The portable data collection terminal comprises a base processing unit and a communication processor, as well as a first and second transceiver selected from a plurality of transceivers. The base processing unit operates according to its own set of communication software routines. Further, each of the plurality of transceivers has different operating characteristics. The communication processor isolates the base processing unit from the differences in the operating characteristics of the first and second transceivers.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, the base processing unit is contained in a base module of the portable data collection terminal. The data collection terminal also has a communication module that contains the communication processor and the first and second transceivers.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Functional interconnections and power saving features of the present invention may be better understood from knowing how various building blocks or modules of a portable data collection terminal unit relate to each other. FIG. 1 shows a schematic arrangement of various physical modules or components that become integrated into the portable data terminal unit which is designated generally by the numeral <b>10</b>. Hand-held terminals are of generally rectangular, elongate shape for accepted practical user friendliness. Thus the modular terminal unit <b>10</b> desirably has an elongate, rectangular shape. An upper module <b>12</b> provides a sensory or physical interface to an operator of the terminal unit <b>10</b>. The module <b>12</b> is referred to as a keyboard and display module <b>12</b> and features a keyboard <b>14</b> which may be a typical alphanumerical keyboard, including also function keys and cursor manipulation keys as part of an integrated keyboard arrangement. The keyboard <b>14</b> may be, and desirably is, a submodule in itself, inserted and mounted into a mounting frame <b>15</b> of the keyboard and display module <b>12</b>. In a typical manner, the depression of molded keytops <b>16</b> generally closes electrical contacts in a lower contact plane (not visible) of the keyboard <b>14</b>. The type of keyboard <b>14</b> is, however, not critical and not considered limiting to the invention. The keyboard <b>14</b> being a selected one of a number of available keyboards is, however pertinent to the invention. For example, in one application the keyboard <b>14</b> may be preferred to be a twenty or a twenty-four key keyboard. Such a keyboard <b>14</b> comprises comparatively few keytops <b>16</b>, the locations and functions of which are more readily learned and accepted by an operator. Such keyboards typically do not have alphabetical key functions. Thus for many record keeping and merchandising operations, the keyboard <b>14</b> having an array of twenty or twenty-four keytops may be most desirable. In another operation, a greater number of keytops <b>16</b> may be required to display the letters of the alphabet, numbers, and to provide for the execution of various functions. Thus, a keyboard <b>14</b> having an array of fifty-six keytops <b>16</b> may be preferred. Numerous variations in the arrangement of the keytops <b>16</b> within the array of the keyboard <b>14</b> are additionally possible. Mechanical or touch sensitive keytops <b>16</b> may be employed. In fact, touch sensitive keyboards which are known in the art, and typically involve programming and bi-directional feedback, may be improved by interconnection features of the present invention which will become apparent from the detailed description as a whole.</p>
    <p>The keyboard and display module <b>12</b> further includes an upper cavity <b>17</b> wherein a display screen <b>18</b> is disposed. The display screen <b>18</b> is preferably a state-of-the-art liquid crystal display, the liquid crystal display (“LCD”) technology being well established in the art. A dot-addressable liquid crystal array screen <b>18</b> is ideal for “User friendliness” and versatility and permits the display of various alphanumeric characters and graphic symbols, as well as Chinese or Japanese character symbols. Of course, dot-addressable graphic representations are known to require a substantial level of data processing and memory storage to permit the symbols to be displayed or moved about on the display screen <b>18</b> with reasonable speed. Long delays between the time that an operator pushes a keytop <b>16</b> to obtain data and the time that the requested data are displayed is considered “user unfriendly” and is commercially undesirable. A display technology which has become a standard is referred to as VGA technology. VGA screens are capable of fine gray scale or color resolutions. The display screen <b>18</b> would be part of a selected display screen module <b>19</b> of a number of available display screen modules.</p>
    <p>FIG. 1A illustrates one embodiment of the data processing terminal of the present invention illustrating advantages in the modular design approach. The terminal utilizes a microprocessor controlled data transfer between the base module <b>201</b> and any of a number of data and communication modules which may include various data collection and data communication transceivers such as narrowband radio frequency, frequency-hopping or direct-sequence spread spectrum radio frequency, modem or other wired network communication, infrared, etc. The terminal <b>10</b> and all of its circuits, including those of attached modules, are powered by a power pack module <b>23</b> as described herein.</p>
    <p>Specifically, FIG. 1A shows a block diagram of functions of the base module <b>201</b> and a typical data and communications module designated generally by the numeral <b>200</b>. The base module <b>201</b> is operative in conjunction with a typical radio frequency transceiver provided by the data and communication module <b>200</b>, for example. The base module <b>201</b> includes a typical keyboard module <b>202</b> interactively coupled to a microprocessor <b>204</b>. A preferred microprocessor is a 80C196KC device which is a 16-bit microcontroller <b>205</b> with on-chip masked ROM, RAM and built-in timers, ports, analog to digital converters and a serial interface <b>206</b>. Thus, the microprocessor functions as a microcontroller and as an interface for communicating data and control signals to and from the base module <b>201</b>. In addition to the on-chip memory capacity, an external ROM <b>207</b> and an external RAM <b>208</b> may be provided for additional data processing and communication capacity. Display controller and driver circuits <b>209</b> may be multi-chip circuits or may be integrated into a single device to drive the described LCD screen <b>210</b>. A typical scanner interface <b>215</b> is coupled to a 9-pin connector <b>216</b>, such as the referred to D-subminiature connector which may couple a laser scanner or CCD scanner to the base module <b>201</b> for data collection.</p>
    <p>The data and communication module <b>200</b> is of particular interest in that an improved interfacing may be obtained by coupling communication between the data and communication module <b>200</b> and the base module <b>201</b> through a microprocessor <b>225</b>, such as, for example an 80C51 microprocessor circuit. Typical on board ROM allows the microprocessor to be programmed to interact with a number of devices in accordance with the stored program. The microprocessor interacts with an interface circuit <b>226</b> which may be an analog or mixed analog and digital interface circuit. The program for interacting with the interface circuit <b>226</b> may also be stored within an on board ROM. The interface circuit <b>226</b> is coupled to a transceiver module <b>228</b>. The microprocessor <b>225</b> may also be coupled directly to a data collection interface <b>229</b> to receive data from a scanner for reading any number of different bar codes or for providing input data from other external sources. The operation of the microprocessor <b>225</b> for coupling data to the base module <b>201</b> transforms communication patterns, allowing various input patterns to be processed by any of specific operational protocols controlled by the microprocessor <b>225</b>, such that the data input from the data collection circuit can be made the same from any of a number of devices, isolating the base module <b>201</b> from differences in operating characteristics among the communication module devices. Also, with respect to the operation of the transceiver, the program for operating the microprocessor <b>225</b> may include particular address codes for data retrieval and data communication via the transceiver. The data sent via a data and control bus between the microprocessors <b>225</b> and <b>204</b> is converted to a uniform data transfer protocol or communication pattern to the base module <b>201</b>. The addition of the microprocessor <b>225</b> in a data and communication module <b>200</b> thus increases the number of communications devices that may be represented by the data communication transceiver circuit or module.</p>
    <p>The data and communication module <b>200</b> may be removed and replaced with a number of other modules. In those modules, the transceiver <b>228</b> may be, for example, any RF radio, such as a spread spectrum, UHF, or cellular transceiver, or a wired network transceiver, or an infrared transceiver. The commonality between all communication modules is the microprocessor <b>225</b> and the associated communication protocol back to the microprocessor <b>205</b> of the base module <b>201</b>. In other words, the program function represented by the interface circuit <b>226</b> and interacting with the microprocessor <b>225</b> permits the interactive control and data stream between the base module <b>201</b> and the data and communication module <b>200</b> to appear the same to the base module <b>201</b> no matter how the module <b>200</b> communicates, effectively isolating the base module <b>201</b> from differences in operating characteristics associated with the transceiver <b>228</b> of communication module <b>200</b>.</p>
    <p>The reference to the particular microprocessor circuits should not be considered limiting to the scope of the invention. The combination of two microprocessors interacting with each other, each controlling the environment of a respective one of two submodules such as the base module and the data and communication module permits an increased number of different components and functions to be used within the data system. The data collection terminal unit of the present invention is particularly designed for use in a mobile computer network. Such a network connects mobile interactive radio-equipped computers (such as the terminal unit <b>10</b>) to an infrastructure of stationary computer devices.</p>
    <p>Communication within the network is generally governed by software control through a grouping of software routines. Together, the software routines define an overall communication protocol for the network. The software groupings also define a stack of protocol layers; i.e., a protocol stack. The protocol stack divides the overall communication protocol into hierarchical layers of functionality.</p>
    <p>FIG. 1B illustrates one embodiment of the software protocol stack used by the modular data collection terminal unit of the present invention. The protocol stack is split to illustrate that the functionality of the software is divided between the base module <b>201</b> and the data and communication module <b>200</b>. Specifically, the functionality of the upper layers of the protocol stack (i.e., sessions layer <b>251</b>, transport layer <b>253</b>, and network layer <b>255</b>) is performed by the microprocessor <b>205</b> of the base module <b>201</b> while the functionality of the lower layers (i.e., data link layer <b>257</b> and physical layer <b>259</b> is performed by the microprocessor <b>225</b> of the data and communication module <b>200</b>.</p>
    <p>The sessions layer <b>251</b> performs general login functions, such as authentication of passwords, etc.</p>
    <p>The transport layer <b>253</b> provides end-to-end connectivity within a mobile computer network. It recovers from lost data packets, discards duplicate data packets, and fragments and reassembles logical user messages. Essentially, the transport layer <b>253</b> provides a data pipeline between access points in terminal modes.</p>
    <p>The network layer <b>255</b> provides end-to-end delivery of data packets within a mobile computer network. Specifically, the network layer <b>255</b> (1) organizes modes in the network into a spanning tree; (2) routes data packets along branches of the spanning tree; (3) provides a service for storing data packets for sleeping terminals (i.e. power management); (4) propagates lost terminal mode information throughout the spanning tree; (5) maintains spanning tree links; (6) allocates and distributes network addresses; and (7) maintains and provides diagnostic network statistics.</p>
    <p>The data link layer <b>257</b> controls access to the communication channel and is responsible for providing reliable transmission between any two devices in the network on both wired and wireless links.</p>
    <p>The physical layer <b>259</b> performs radio modem functions and is therefore very radio transceiver dependent.</p>
    <p>As can be appreciated, the lower the level in the protocol stack, the more transceiver dependent the protocol becomes. Similarly, the lower the level, the more business environment specific the protocol becomes. Thus, a good dividing line for the protocol layers that exist in the communication module <b>200</b> is at the data link layer <b>257</b>. This way, any communication module <b>200</b> supporting any type of transceiver can communicate with the common higher levels or protocol stack existing in the base module <b>201</b>.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, the dividing line might also be drawn at a higher level, for example, at the network layer <b>255</b>, or somewhere in between. For example, referring to FIG. 1C, a portion of the network layer which addresses the specific concerns of roaming portable terminals and power management might be migrated into the communication module <b>200</b>. Such migration permits the communication module <b>200</b> protocol substack to be able to communicate with other higher level protocol stacks which do not directly support such network layer functionality.</p>
    <p>Further detail regarding mobile computer networks and the above protocol is found in attached Appendix A, a Masters Thesis entitled “Mobile Computer Network Architecture” authored by Robert C. Meier.</p>
    <p>FIG. 1C illustrates the compatibility of the lower layers of the protocol stack (i.e., that of the data and communication module <b>200</b> used by the data collection terminal unit of the present invention with a variety of standard protocol stacks. Particularly, the protocol of the data and communication module <b>200</b> is capable of interfacing with any personal computer (PC) based platforms that use a standard protocol stack. Such PC based platforms may include, for example, a Novell Ethernet Network or TCP/IP. The network layer protocol associated with the mobility of a terminal unit (i.e. specific spanning tree and power management functionality), data link layer, and the physical link layer is managed by the microprocessor <b>225</b> of the data and communication module <b>200</b>. This protocol substack is stored in the interface circuit <b>226</b>. Similarly, the substack containing the sessions layer transport layer and a majority of the network layer is stored in memory in the base module <b>201</b>.</p>
    <p>In an alternate embodiment, FIG. 2 illustrates a schematic diagram of functional interfaces among various modules of the data collection terminal unit of FIG. <b>1</b>. As will become more apparent below, the embodiment in FIG. 2 expands on the concept explained in reference to FIG. 1A of splitting up the hardware functionality and software protocol layers of the terminal unit <b>10</b> to enable ease of radio transceiver substitution. FIG. 2 refers to a display screen module <b>20</b> which is similar in function to display screen module <b>19</b> discussed above, yet which may include selected differences to illustrate the advantages of the modular concept in combination with other features of the present invention. Display screens may vary in size or resolution or both, such that options among a number of display screen modules <b>19</b> may be made available to a potential user of the terminal unit <b>10</b>. A display of an array of (128 by 240) pixels of, for example, (0.25×0.25) millimeter is an example of what is considered to be a desirable display screen resolution. Another screen array size may be (64×192) pixels, for example, of (0.35×0.50) millimeter per pixel.</p>
    <p>The keyboard and display module <b>12</b> occupies most of the area of the terminal unit <b>10</b> which faces an operator when the terminal unit <b>10</b> is held and operationally used by the operator. Assembled to an underside <b>21</b> of the keyboard and display module <b>12</b> are preferably two major modules of the terminal unit <b>10</b>. A first module is what is referred to as the terminal module <b>22</b>. Whereas the keyboard and display module <b>12</b> is the major interface component between the operator and the terminal unit <b>10</b>, the terminal module <b>22</b> is a major functional component of the terminal unit <b>10</b> itself, as will become apparent from the description herein. The terminal module <b>22</b> functionally controls the interaction of the various units or modules as described herein, and functionally is the control unit of the terminal unit <b>10</b>. The terminal module <b>22</b> houses functional submodules and microprocessor circuits. A significant component is, of course, a power pack module <b>23</b>. The power pack module may contain, for example, six AA type rechargeable cells which may be arranged in a convenient flat arrangement and fitted into a battery end <b>24</b> of a housing <b>25</b> of the terminal module <b>22</b>. The power pack module <b>23</b> supplies the power to various modules of the terminal unit <b>10</b>, thus providing the capability for portable use of the terminal unit <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>From the above description of potential choices of the type of display on the display screen <b>18</b>, and further choices among keyboard arrangements of the keyboard <b>14</b>, different requirements for electronic support circuits are indicated. One of the requirements to support the economical changing of functions is a means to provide a ready change in programmability of microprocessor circuits. Some module selections of the terminal unit <b>10</b> require less memory usage and different operational protocols than others. In accordance with a preferred embodiment, a memory module <b>27</b> may be selected as one of a number of differently programmed memory modules <b>27</b>. However, in addition to being differently programmed, an alternate memory module <b>28</b> may include a different memory size (in cell numbers and in configuration). The terminal module <b>22</b> may further include an exchangeable memory card <b>30</b>. The memory card <b>30</b> may be used to provide additional memory capacity as well as control programs for various desired functions of the various modules as described herein. The memory card <b>30</b> is schematically shown as being insertible laterally into a slot <b>32</b> of the housing <b>25</b> of the terminal module <b>22</b>. However, the shown physical arrangement is but one of a number of equally desirable arrangements. An enclosed and sealed arrangement for the memory card <b>30</b> is desirable to protect modules of the terminal unit <b>10</b> from the environment.</p>
    <p>A peripheral I/O module <b>34</b> is shown at a lower or inner end <b>35</b> (see FIG. 1) of the terminal unit <b>10</b>. The inner end <b>35</b> is typically pointed toward an operator of the terminal unit <b>10</b>, as the unit is held in the operator's hand with the keyboard and display module <b>12</b> directed upward toward the operator. The I/O (Input-Output) module <b>34</b> may typically include externally of a housing <b>36</b> a standard RS-232 and RS-485 connector <b>37</b>. FIG. 1 also depicts a round communication connector <b>38</b>. The peripheral I/O module <b>34</b> provides an interface between the terminal unit <b>10</b> and such diverse peripheral devices as “docks”. Docks may be batch transfer devices for transferring accumulated data, battery charging devices, or cables which may connect to a code scanner, for example. An RS-232 interface is typically connected to a printer, for example.</p>
    <p>A serial I/O and scan connection module <b>41</b> may be attached at a longitudinally opposite outer end <b>40</b> (see FIG. 1) of the terminal unit <b>10</b>. The scan connection module <b>41</b> is a high speed serial data communication module <b>41</b> which provides for serial data to be received in high volume from a scanner for example. Scanner data are typically received in a high density data string and require significant processing. As will become apparent below, a direct communication link to the data processing capability of the terminal unit <b>10</b> is provided through the scan connection module <b>41</b>.</p>
    <p>A further functional module is a communication module <b>44</b>. Again in reference to FIG. 1, the communication module <b>44</b> may be disposed adjacent the terminal module <b>22</b> toward the outer end <b>40</b> of the terminal unit <b>10</b>. The communication module <b>44</b> is selected from a group of available communication modules of distinct functions. The selection of one of the communication modules such as the communication module <b>44</b> in FIG. 1, may characterize or classify the operation of the terminal unit <b>10</b>. For example, a communication module <b>44</b> may have been selected from a group of modules which include standard FM data radio transceiver modules, spread spectrum radio transceiver modules, modem communication modules, scanner device modules, or other data input or communication devices. FIG. 2 shows a communication module <b>45</b> as an alternate to the physical representation of the communication module <b>44</b> shown in FIG. 1 to indicate a diversity of modules available for substitution. In further reference to FIG. 1, the communication module <b>44</b> is shown as having an antenna <b>46</b>, indicating the selection being a transceiver unit for radio frequency real time communication with a data system. Such a data system typically includes a further transceiver station, not shown, with which the transceiver module <b>44</b> communicates. In other embodiments, the transceiver unit selected my be a wired or infrared transceiver for use with their appropriate communication networks. The operator of the terminal unit <b>10</b> also constitutes a second end of a communication link that is established by the operator's manipulation of the keyboard <b>14</b> and by the operator's visual perception and recognition of the data displayed on the display screen <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 2, a functional schematic diagram of a combination of the physical modules discussed with respect to FIG. 1, or of alternate equivalents of the modules in FIG. 1, is shown. The modules with respect to which preferred physical positioning was discussed in reference to FIG. 1 are now shown functionally related in FIG. <b>2</b>. It is to be noted that the schematic representation refers to functional or communication rather than electrical connections. The power pack <b>23</b> is typically coupled to power all electrically driven circuits of the terminal unit <b>10</b>. The power pack <b>23</b> is functionally and physically coupled to the terminal module <b>22</b>. While electrical power is distributed from the power pack <b>23</b> to all electrically powered or controlled modules of the terminal unit, the remaining power of the power pack is actually monitored by a function of the terminal module <b>22</b>. The power pack <b>23</b> as the sole portable power source for the terminal unit <b>10</b> would, but for power saving provisions, experience a significant power drain during the operation of the terminal unit <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>Power savings are implemented by selectively using circuit functions as they are needed. Accordingly, the terminal module includes preferably first and second microprocessors <b>48</b> and <b>49</b>, respectively. The first microprocessor <b>48</b> is a data processing device and is also referred to herein as an application processor <b>48</b>. The application processor may be any of a number of available microprocessors available. Desirably the application microprocessor <b>48</b> has the capability of processing data with greater word length or word width than the second processor <b>49</b>. The term word width refers to the number of data bits that are capable of simultaneously being processed, retrieved or stored. The application processor <b>48</b> is therefore one capable, for example, of processing a 16-bit or a 32-bit data word. The processing speed and clocking rate of the application processor <b>48</b> would desirably exceed that of the second microprocessor <b>49</b>. At present, the more powerful microprocessors, such as the microprocessor <b>48</b>, have higher power requirements than the second microprocessor <b>49</b>. However, even with the higher power requirement during operation, power savings may be achieved by providing a rest state at which the microprocessor <b>48</b> is not clocked and thus deactivated.</p>
    <p>The second microprocessor <b>49</b> is also referred to as a control processor <b>49</b>. The second microprocessor controls the operation of the terminal module <b>22</b> and controls communication within the terminal module as well as among the various other modules of the terminal unit <b>10</b>. The control processor <b>49</b> requires less power for operation than the application processor <b>48</b> for reasons that will become apparent. Control is an ongoing function. Because the operational speed of the control processor <b>49</b> is comparatively slower than that of the application processor <b>48</b>, the operational power consumption of the control processor <b>49</b> is also lower than that of the application processor <b>48</b>. The control processor <b>49</b> may be a Hitachi H8/330 type microprocessor device. The Hitachi H8/330 processor features on-board memory which is convenient for its intended operation as will be seen in reference to its operational modes as set forth herein. The H8 type processor is an 8-bit processor, capable of processing data in an 8-bit word length. However, the control processor <b>49</b> need not be an 8-bit processor. In general, the word width processing capacity of the control processor <b>49</b> should be chosen to be relatively less than that of the application processor <b>48</b>. The control processor <b>49</b> does not require the processing speed that is desirable for the application processor <b>48</b>, and, processors with relatively low word width processing capacity (considering processors in general) require less processing power. It should be understood, however, that the specification of any particular device, such as the Hitachi H8-type microprocessor for the control processor <b>49</b>, is for illustrative purposes only. The features and desired functions of the invention will be helpful to one skilled in the art to select any of a number of acceptable devices to function in the desired manner as described herein.</p>
    <p>FIG. 3 shows a schematic block representative of signal terminals of the control microprocessor <b>49</b> which are pertinent to the preferred mode of implementing the present invention. In describing the significant signal and data terminals, a bar above a designation indicates that a low signal is active. Herein, the inverse or signal low active state is described with an “N” preceding the letter name at the respective signal term. To communicate among the various described modules, four signal leads of the control processor <b>49</b> define the leads of a communication bus <b>50</b> referred to herein as “MBUS”. The MBUS <b>50</b> is a high speed synchronous serial data signal bus which may, and preferably does, operate at a signal rate of 500 kilo bits per second. The high speed data bus provides reliability advantages explained below. In a modular structure in which the modules are readily disconnected and reconnected to permit convenient changes during the manufacture of the final product, may reduce the reliability of the terminal unit <b>10</b>. When reliability is decreased with each additionally coupled module, the advantages of modular structure are quickly dissipated. Compared to typical parallel data buses used to link components of electronic products or systems, the present system architecture of the modular terminal unit <b>10</b> requires significantly fewer contacts to interconnect the various modules. With fewer signal lines to manage, it becomes more feasible to protect each line from noise and interference effects by using well known shielding, impedance reduction and termination techniques thereby increasing the reliability of the terminal unit <b>10</b>. As a result, the present invention is typically more reliable than modular systems with conventional parallel data transfer, due to the reduction in the interconnections among the various modules. FIG. 3 shows four signal terminals which constitute the MBUS concept. “MCLK” is the clocking signal which synchronizes the modular counterparts of the control processor <b>49</b>. The clocking signal provides for a bit rate of 500 kilo bits per-second. The terminal labeled “MTXD” transfers data from the control processor onto the MBUS <b>50</b>. The terminal labeled MRXD receives data from other modules over the MBUS <b>50</b>. The low signal active “NMATT” is a control signal line which indicates that data will be communicated over the MBUS <b>50</b>. These four lines effectively permit the various modules to communicate among each other. A number of signal contention protocols are available to resolve potential collisions in data communication. It should be understood that any standard signal contention protocol may be modified if so desired to assign specific priorities for communication among the modules. For example, data received from a scanning operation may be accepted and processed on a priority basis. Keystroke inputs from the keyboard and display module <b>12</b> may be given priority over data flow from the communication module <b>45</b>. Similarly, data messages received via radio transmission from an external master unit (not shown) may be given priority. Program altering instructions may be embedded within the message which affect future operations of the terminal unit <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>Further with respect to FIG. 3, corresponding data lines interfacing with the application processor <b>48</b> are indicated as parallel signal lines DBO-<b>7</b> and data lines A<b>0</b>-<b>3</b>. Data communication and control procedures between the control microprocessor <b>49</b> and the application processor <b>48</b> are further described with respect to alternate embodiments.</p>
    <p>Referring again to FIG. 2, the application processor <b>48</b> is coupled to an asynchronous device or “UAR/T” function <b>51</b> with an output coupled to a serial port <b>52</b> of the serial I/O scan connection module <b>41</b>. The serial I/O scan connection module <b>41</b> further includes a scan port <b>53</b> which links to the control processor <b>49</b> to communicate control signals, such as scan trigger signals, for example. The application processor <b>48</b> is further coupled to a VGA adapter circuit or driver <b>54</b> for driving the display screen <b>20</b>. The display screen function is processor intensive. Data processing operations are, therefore, managed directly through the application processor <b>48</b>. The data processing operations performed by the application processor <b>48</b> are in most instances memory-usage intensive. Consequently, the application processor <b>48</b> is linked by a conventional data bus <b>55</b> directly to the memory module <b>28</b>. The memory module <b>28</b> is shown as including representative data storage functions or circuits including a 16-bit word width system FLASH-programmable memory <b>56</b>, a typical 16-bit word width random access memory <b>57</b> (“RAM”), and additional application FLASH-programmable memory <b>58</b>, also preferably 16-bit word width. The 16-bit word width storage devices <b>56</b>, <b>57</b> and <b>58</b> are preferred in conjunction with a 16-bit microprocessor device. Presently preferred 16-bit microprocessors are a Chips and Technologies F8680 device or an Advanced Micro Devices 386SXLV processor. The selection of other processors for the microprocessor <b>48</b> may require different types of memory devices or different word width or storage capacities than those described above.</p>
    <p>The peripheral I/O module <b>34</b> may, as discussed with respect to FIG. 1, include standard connectors for coupling the module <b>34</b> to an external device. A particular device <b>59</b> may be a portable printer device, as shown in the function block <b>59</b> of FIG. 2, which may be mounted or coupled directly to the terminal unit <b>10</b>. The peripheral I/O device, whether it is a printer or a reader or other data input or output device, would functionally include a microprocessor <b>60</b>. The microprocessor <b>60</b> is chosen to interact with the MBUS system. The microprocessor <b>60</b> is coupled in each described element to function as a terminal element, which is an interface communicatively coupling the respective logic circuits of the module to the MBUS. The microprocessor <b>60</b> receives control codes via the MBUS <b>50</b> and responds by activating or de-activating the power circuits of the respective module, or conditioning the module to receive or transmit data.</p>
    <p>The communication module <b>45</b>, which may be a modem, a wired network communication transceiver, or any of a number of available wireless transceiver modules, or may include two or more of the above transceivers, also includes a compatible microprocessor <b>60</b> which interfaces with a respective communication device <b>61</b> of the module <b>45</b>. The communication device <b>61</b> may be a modem or transceiver device, for example. To be compatible with the MBUS data format of the other described modules. The keyboard and display module <b>12</b> also preferably includes its own interfacing microprocessor device <b>60</b>. The keyboard and display microprocessor <b>60</b> is coupled to control various functions which are directly associated with the keyboard and display module <b>12</b>. A particular function which may be conveniently controlled via the MBUS <b>50</b> and the respective control processors <b>49</b> and <b>60</b> is a backlight drive <b>62</b> for the display screen <b>20</b>. Another function is a buzzer <b>63</b>. The buzzer <b>63</b> may be activated to signal an incorrect key depression by an operator. The buzzer <b>63</b> may further be used to alert an operator when a charge and power control circuit <b>64</b> detects that the power pack <b>23</b> has become discharged and a backup battery <b>65</b> is being engaged, giving a user time to recharge or replace battery pack <b>23</b>. The power control <b>64</b> may function to shut down the terminal unit <b>10</b> from further operation until the power pack has been recharged. In a preferred embodiment, power from the backup battery <b>65</b> would be maintained on the control processor to permit it to determine when power from the power pack <b>23</b> has been restored. The processor <b>60</b> of the keyboard and display module <b>12</b> may also control other input or output devices that may be coupled to the keyboard and display module <b>12</b>. For example, a pen <b>66</b> may be coupled to the keyboard and display module <b>12</b> for use in connection with a pen stylus sensitive keyboard module <b>14</b> or in connection with a pen stylus sensitive display screen <b>20</b>. In this latter instance, the display screen module <b>20</b> becomes an input device in addition to being an output device.</p>
    <p>The application processor <b>48</b> and the control processor <b>49</b> are preferably controlled through a timing Application Specific Integrated Circuit <b>67</b> (“clock control ASIC”). The clock control circuit <b>67</b> may be driven from a single clock signal which is then divided to provide respectively different clocking rates to each of the processors <b>48</b> and <b>49</b>. The implementation of the timing circuit <b>67</b> in a single circuit function is more efficient and provides synchronization among the components and modules. A second clock signal for implementing a real time clock may also be provided.</p>
    <p>In addition to providing better reliability as discussed above, the MBUS <b>50</b> also provides more compact physical routing of cables among the modules. Furthermore, control of the functions of the various described modules via the MBUS <b>50</b> provides power savings, as will be described more fully below in reference to FIGS. 4 and 5. To conserve power and prolong the operational time of the terminal unit <b>10</b> between changes or recharges of the power pack <b>23</b>, the control processor <b>49</b> and the related MBUS module processors <b>60</b> place any module which is not in active use into dormant state.</p>
    <p>The MBUS <b>50</b> communicatively interconnects the modules of the terminal unit <b>10</b>, such as the peripheral I/O module <b>34</b>, the communication module <b>45</b>, the keyboard and display module <b>12</b> and the terminal module <b>22</b>. Other modules that may be included in the active communication network of the MBUS <b>50</b> may simply be added as described herein. For each module, one of the microprocessors <b>60</b>, having the data terminals of the microprocessor <b>49</b> shown in FIG. 3, namely MCLK, MTXD, MRXD and NMATT are coupled to the respective lines of the MBUS <b>50</b> to become part of the internal communication network of the terminal unit <b>10</b>. The microprocessors <b>49</b> and <b>60</b> constitute the terminal elements of the communication network represented by the MBUS <b>50</b>. For each module, the respective microprocessor <b>60</b>, though it may be physically identical to the control microprocessor <b>49</b>, functions as a subservient processor to the control processor <b>49</b>. The microprocessors <b>60</b> become a communication interface between the MBUS <b>50</b> and the functional circuits of the respective module, whether the module is the communication module <b>45</b>, the keyboard and display module <b>12</b> or the peripheral I/O module <b>34</b>. Inputs from the respective module are accepted by the processor <b>60</b>. An H8/330 microprocessor includes internal memory for receiving and temporarily storing data communications. Programmable ROM on the H8/330 permit instructions to be stored which particularly configure the microprocessor as a module processor <b>60</b>. The interface operation of the microprocessor <b>60</b> differs from the controlling operation of the control processor <b>49</b> as shown below in reference to FIGS. 4 and 5.</p>
    <p>A normal state of the microprocessors <b>49</b> and <b>60</b> is a sub-active or dormant state. In this state, the module processors <b>60</b> and the control processor <b>49</b> are clocked at a power saving “slow” clocking speed. The sub-active or dormant operational state permits the module processors <b>60</b> and the control processor <b>49</b> to execute certain long-interval control functions. For example, the keyboard and display screen processor <b>60</b> monitors the keyboard in order to sense a keytop depression while the control processor <b>49</b> maintains the charge and power control circuit <b>64</b> in order to sense a low battery signal. Upon occurrence of an event which that affects the operation of any typical communication function that is driven over the MBUS <b>50</b>, all modules and the control processor are placed into a fully activated mode. The control processor <b>49</b> queries, directs and controls communication over the MBUS <b>50</b>. For example, FIG. 4 shows an activation cycle of the MBUS <b>50</b> which is initiated by one of described modules other than the terminal module <b>22</b>, i.e., from one of the processors <b>60</b>. The respective processor <b>60</b> drives the NMATT line of the MBUS <b>50</b> into a low signal state. The low state of the NMATT line activates all processors <b>60</b> to receive an inquiry or instructions. At T<b>1</b> in FIG. 4 all modules have been placed into the active state. During the time interval T<b>1</b> to T<b>2</b> the control processor sends a query or polls the activated modules over the MTXD line which is reserved for transmissions originating from the terminal module <b>22</b>, i.e., from the control processor <b>49</b>. The query would typically contain at least one byte of data, the quantitative translation of the byte of data indicating to the processors <b>60</b> that it is a query in response to one of the module processors <b>60</b> having driven the NMATT line to a low state. The query shown at <b>70</b> signals the processor <b>60</b> to transmit its data message over the MRXD line of the MBUS <b>50</b>. At the onset of the data transmission <b>72</b> from the respective communicating module processor <b>60</b>, the NMATT line is restored to a high state, placing all other modules back into the dormant condition. As shown in FIG. 4, the data communication may proceed for a variable length of time past the time state T<b>2</b> at which the NMATT line has returned to a high state. Upon termination of data communication from the respective module processor <b>60</b> to the control processor <b>49</b>, the control processor <b>49</b> sends a message <b>73</b> confirming correct receipt of the data message (at T<b>3</b>). Again the confirming data message contains at least one byte of information, the decoding of which would either indicate an error code or signal the correct receipt of the data message. At that time (at T<b>3</b>), the communicating module processor <b>60</b> and the control processor <b>49</b> also assume the power saving dormant state.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5 describes a very similar event in which the control processor <b>49</b> drives the NMATT line to a low state. Again, all processors <b>60</b> assume an active state and all processors <b>60</b> receive a communication <b>75</b> of typically at least one byte of information from the control processor <b>49</b> during the time interval between T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b>. The information <b>75</b> contains an address of the module to which a data message from the control processor <b>49</b> will be directed. The respective module processor acknowledges its understanding of the address by a responding message <b>76</b> which may be translated by the control processor <b>49</b>. In response to the receipt of the message the control processor releases the NMATT line, which assumes its normal high state and places all non-affected module processors <b>60</b> again into a dormant state. The control processor <b>49</b> then transmits its data message as indicated at <b>77</b> to the respective, previously addressed module processor <b>60</b>. At the conclusion of the communication <b>77</b> from the control processor <b>49</b>, the respective module processor acknowledges receipt of the communication <b>77</b> by its response <b>78</b>. Once it is interpreted from the response <b>78</b> that the communication <b>77</b> has been received correctly, both the control processor <b>49</b> and the respective module processor <b>60</b> assume their dormant states. It is to be noted that the respective data messages shown in FIGS. 4 and 5 indicate durations of data messages. It is to be understood that the high and low states of other than the NMATT line indicate a time interval during which a great number of high or low states in synchronous time slots are transmitted essentially at the bit rate of 500 kilo bits per second. This bit rate may include start and stop intervals.</p>
    <p>In the described communication events, power consumption by the terminal unit <b>10</b> is minimized by providing for a quasi dormant state for substantially all functions of the various modules, such that electrical power is used in pulses during the described query states and only in spurts by certain modules during real time performances. The power saving features in communication from and to the various modules is further present in implementing highly power intensive data processing operations in the terminal module <b>22</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 6, the schematic diagram illustrates an alternate embodiment of the present invention where major functional logic and communications elements are coupled to and interact with the application processor <b>48</b> and the control processor <b>49</b> in a power-conserving microprocessor circuit <b>80</b>. The circuit <b>80</b> may control the operations of, or be functional in the operation of, the terminal unit <b>10</b>. The terminal unit <b>10</b> may interact as described with one or more distinct functional modules including communication modules, such as a transceiver communication module (“RADIO”) shown at <b>81</b>. Because the terminal unit <b>10</b> being portable, the physical circuits of the functional units or modules shown in FIG. 6 would typically be powered by the power pack or battery <b>23</b> (shown schematically in FIG. <b>2</b>), which is illustratively included in the power management function (“POWER CONTR”) <b>64</b>. The microprocessor operated control circuit <b>80</b> comprises a combination of the application microprocessor <b>48</b> and the control microprocessor <b>49</b>. The circuit <b>80</b> can also be two circuit portions that include specifically two microprocessor type subcircuits <b>48</b> and <b>49</b>. Each of these subcircuits <b>48</b> or <b>49</b> are separately functioning microprocessor blocks, modules or separate microprocessor devices. In the preferred embodiment as described herein the devices are respectively an application processor <b>48</b> (“MP1”) and a control processor <b>49</b> (“MP2”). It is advantageous to perform data processing operations at a comparatively higher speed and with a more powerful processor than is be desirable for relatively less complex control functions.</p>
    <p>The term “data processing operation” is used herein in the sense of manipulating a series of binary codes according to programmed instructions to arrive at a desired result. Because of the great number of discrete binary operations required to perform many of the most common data processing functions, higher processor speeds and more complex or powerful microprocessor circuits of those typically available are more desirable for data processing operations.</p>
    <p>In the now described embodiment, the application processor or data processing device <b>48</b> may be an “Intel 80C188EB ” device which is “16-Bit” microprocessor device, operated at a preferred speed of 9.2 megahertz (MHz). At such preferred clocking speed of 9.2 MHz, the power consumption or operating current consumed by the data processing microprocessor device <b>48</b> is approximately 55 milliamps (“mA”). The control processor <b>49</b> may be a “Hitachi H8/325” device which is an “8-Bit” microprocessor, operated at a speed of one-half of the speed of the data processing microprocessor <b>48</b>, that is, 4.6 MHz. Because of the smaller physical size of the control processor <b>49</b> and the slower, preferred clocking speed, the power consumption or current required by the control processor <b>49</b> in its operational mode is only about 9 mA, that is less than one-fifth of the power consumed by the processor <b>48</b>. In general, the control microprocessor circuit or the control microprocessor <b>49</b> desirably operates at a slower and less power consuming speed than the application microprocessor circuit or the application microprocessor <b>48</b>. A one-to-two speed ratio for driving the respective microprocessors <b>49</b> and <b>48</b> is preferably chosen because of the power savings that are realized with respect to the portable terminal unit <b>10</b>. Respective clocking circuits <b>82</b> and <b>83</b> (“CLCK 1 and CLCK 2”) are shown as providing respective timing signal ports coupled to the respective processors <b>48</b> and <b>49</b> to drive the processors at the desired speeds as described.</p>
    <p>Also, a functional arrangement of the separate clocking circuits <b>82</b> and <b>83</b> preferably may be replaced by the clock control circuit <b>67</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>2</b>. The clock control circuit <b>67</b> may be expanded in its function to include an interface circuit function between the processors <b>48</b> and <b>49</b> which includes data transfer as well as clocking functions. The clock control circuit <b>67</b> would include in such coupling arrangement a typical divide-by-two timing circuit function. An original 9.2 MHz clocking signal port and a signal port with the divided by two signal, comparable to the timing signal ports <b>82</b> and <b>83</b>, would be coupled to the respective timing signal input ports of the processors <b>48</b> and <b>49</b>, respectively, to drive the processors <b>48</b> and <b>49</b> at their respective speeds of 9.2 and 4.6 MHz. As mentioned above, a second clock may be coupled to the clock control circuit <b>67</b> to provide a real time clock.</p>
    <p>As will become apparent from the further description, it is within the scope of the invention to integrate the distinct functions and operational characteristics of the separately identified microprocessor devices <b>48</b> and <b>49</b> into a single integrated device. The resulting integrated device <b>80</b> desirably includes respective interface functions, as further described herein, to implement the power-saving characteristics realized by the control circuit <b>80</b>. Within such integrated device <b>80</b>, the function of the application processor <b>48</b> is then performed by a first microprocessor circuit block or circuit portion, and the function of the control processor <b>49</b> is performed by a second microprocessor circuit block or circuit portion. These circuit blocks, portions or modules interact essentially in the same manner within the circuit <b>80</b> as the currently used microprocessor devices <b>48</b> and <b>49</b>.</p>
    <p>The control processor <b>49</b> may include in its commercial implementation, in addition to typical microprocessor registers and an arithmetic logic unit, such functional circuit blocks as ROM, RAM and communications ports. These circuit blocks may also be included in any integrated device <b>80</b>, or their functions may be supplied by peripheral devices. As shown in FIG. 6, additional external memory <b>84</b> (“MEM”) may optionally be provided to supplement such on-board memory <b>85</b> (“OM”), though for typical operations as further described herein, the external memory device <b>84</b> is not required. According to one embodiment, data communication between the processors <b>48</b> and <b>49</b> occurs via an interface circuit that includes, for example, two 8-bit data registers or latches described in greater detail below in relation to FIG. <b>6</b>. It should be understood, however, that the control processor <b>49</b> may have a direct bus interface to enable direct coupling of the control processor <b>49</b> to the application processor <b>48</b>. The coupled processors <b>48</b> and <b>49</b> are capable of bidirectionally passing data and control signals without the described two 8-bit data registers or latches. Also, data latches are generally considered temporary data storage devices. Data from one device are latched into a respective data latch to be retrieved by a second device. Although not preferred, it is contemplated that dual post memory may be used as an alternative to the latches described below.</p>
    <p>The clock control ASIC function <b>67</b> shown in FIG. 2 should be understood to not only include the clocking signal coupling circuits to drive the respective application processor <b>48</b> and the control processor <b>49</b>, but to further include the data interface or bus to permit the desired bidirectional data and control code communication between the processors <b>48</b> and <b>49</b> as further described herein. In further reference to FIG. 2, an integration of the processor devices <b>48</b> and <b>49</b> into a single device desirably may include the described function of the interface and clock control circuit <b>67</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring again to FIG. 6, a first latch <b>86</b> (“LATCH 1”) of the two latches is coupled through an 8-line parallel bus <b>87</b> to the microprocessor <b>49</b>, and through a similar bus <b>88</b> to the microprocessor <b>48</b>. Respective write and read lines <b>89</b> and <b>90</b> (“WRL1 and RDL2”) provide control or trigger signals for the processor <b>49</b> to write data into the first latch <b>86</b> and for the processor <b>48</b> to read data from the latch <b>86</b>. A handshake or control signal line <b>91</b> (“CHAR AVAIL 1”) toggles between a high or “logic 1” to indicate to the processor <b>48</b> that data have been read into the first latch <b>86</b> by the processor <b>49</b> and a “logic 0” to signal that the processor has read or taken the data from the first latch <b>86</b>. A second latch <b>92</b> (“LATCH 2”) similarly stores an 8-bit data element written into the second latch <b>92</b> by the processor <b>48</b> over a second 8-bit write bus <b>93</b>. A second read bus <b>94</b> transfers the data element stored in the second latch <b>92</b> from the latch to the second processor <b>49</b>. The control or trigger signals for writing into or reading from the second data latch <b>92</b> are provided over trigger lines <b>95</b> and <b>96</b> (“WRL2 and RDL2”), respectively. A second handshake or control signal line <b>97</b> (“CHAR AVAIL 2”) coupled to the second latch <b>92</b> and to the processors <b>48</b> and <b>49</b> also toggles between high and low signal states to indicate in the high state the availability of data in the second latch <b>92</b> and in the low state the completion of a read operation of the most recent data element by the control processor <b>49</b>.</p>
    <p>A control signal line <b>98</b> carries a control signal generated by the control processor <b>49</b> which controls the duty cycle of the application processor <b>48</b>. In reference to FIGS. 7 and 8, the current usage of the control processor <b>49</b> ranges between a high of 9 mA in a typical operating mode and a low of about 7 mA in a typical “idle mode” at the preferred frequency of 4.6 MHz, (See FIG. 7, graphs <b>100</b> and <b>101</b>, respectively). It should be realized that even while “idle”, the control processor maintains power to internal memory and performs typical periodic monitoring functions, such as, for example, sampling a keyboard circuit <b>102</b> (“KB”) for a “Depressed Key” signal or routinely monitoring the power management function <b>64</b> for a “Low Battery” indication. However, even when in the typical operational mode as indicated on the current vs. frequency graph <b>100</b>, the control processor uses only about one-sixth of the current used by the application processor <b>48</b> in its preferred operational mode. On the other hand, when the application processor <b>48</b> is placed into an idle state (i.e., when it is not driven by a clocking signal), the required maximum current rating is 0.1 mA, as shown by the high-low indicated values at the 9.2 MHz frequency mark at and below graph <b>103</b> in FIG. <b>8</b>. Graph <b>103</b> indicates the typical operating current consumption of the application processor <b>48</b>. It should be noted that the application processor <b>48</b> could be deactivated by a complete electrical shut down of the device. However, because of the low non-clocked power or current draw of the application processor <b>48</b>, the application processor function is preferably deactivated by eliminating its clocking signal but maintaining the application processor <b>48</b> under DC bias. Removing the clocking signal from the application processor function achieves a desired power-down idle state while permitting the device <b>48</b> to be reactivated immediately by an appropriate “wake up” control signal from the control microprocessor <b>49</b>.</p>
    <p>Typical data processing operations performed by the application processor <b>48</b> require approximately 10 milliseconds of time and not more than 20 milliseconds on the average of all operations which are typically performed by the application processor <b>48</b>. A more user friendly and practical response time may be obtained from the terminal unit <b>10</b> (and less power is required) when the application processor <b>48</b> performs substantially all data processing operations is subsequently immediately deactivated than if a single alternative microprocessor circuit were used operating at a higher rate and including sufficient computing capacity to perform all required functions in an appropriately short time. The combination of the application processor <b>48</b> and the control processor <b>49</b> amounts, only to an approximate increase in current usage of typically about ten percent, and in the extreme of no more than 20 percent, over the normal operating current level of the control processor by itself. The power required by the application processor <b>48</b> as controlled by the control processor <b>49</b> is about one fifth that is required by the control processor <b>49</b> itself when it is operated continuously. However, the display speed and data manipulation speed of the terminal unit <b>10</b> essentially is the same as if the unit <b>10</b> were controlled by the more powerful application processor <b>48</b>.</p>
    <p>The operating current requirement for the application processor <b>48</b> is directly related to the number of actively switching elements in each computational operation. Though having an interrupt function, the referred to 80C188EB processor <b>48</b> does not include, in contrast to the control processor <b>49</b>, any internal memory devices. FIG. 6 consequently shows a data bus <b>55</b> of the processor <b>48</b> coupled to external memory devices, such as the flash electrically erasable and programmable read-only memory <b>58</b> (“FLASH EPROM”), a read-only memory <b>104</b> (“ROM”) and a typical random access memory <b>57</b> (“RAM”). The ROM <b>104</b> is also the functional equivalent to the system FLASH memory <b>56</b>. The data bus <b>55</b> further couples the application processor directly to the display module <b>20</b> (“LCD DISPLAY”) of the terminal unit <b>10</b>. The display module <b>20</b> may be a dot addressable LCD graphic screen module, for example. A direct data transfer by the high speed application processor <b>48</b> to the LCD screen is preferred because of the substantial amounts of data handling or processing that is required in updating a particular screen. For example, even a small graphic screen display, such as a screen of 48×100 pixels, requires that each of the pixels be updated on a continuous basis. Typically control circuits, which are part of the data display function of the module <b>20</b> and are not separately shown, and which may be specific to a particular screen display, may routinely re-apply currently displayed information dots in a cyclic refresh operation to the already identified pixels of the screen. However, any screen update, such as a simple display line scrolling operation, requires that each pixel of the screen be updated. To perform such updating of information in a power efficient and prompt, user-friendly manner, a data processing operation and the high speed passing of the updated data between the RAM memory <b>57</b> and the data display <b>20</b> is accomplished during a short operational activation of the application processor <b>48</b>. More data processing with respect to the data display screen <b>20</b> may be required for routine menu operations. Menu operations are particularly desirable for such portable terminal units <b>10</b>, in that the typical user may not be well acquainted with computer terminals. Well defined menu operations with a number of available menu levels may therefore significantly increase the usefulness of a terminal unit. In addition to requiring the normal display screen update, menu operators also require data base searing and data retrieval. The above-described operations the described microprocessor circuit (i.e., with the selectively activated data processing device <b>48</b> and the relatively smaller and slower control processor <b>49</b>) may be used to perform the menu operations.</p>
    <p>Selective activation and deactivation of the microprocessor circuit portion implemented by the data processing device or application processor <b>48</b> also provides power savings when the operating speeds of the two processors <b>48</b> and <b>49</b> are the same. However, such power savings do not appear to be as great as those realized by the embodiment described above.</p>
    <p>The application processor <b>48</b> may also communicate with a high speed asynchronous communication interface <b>105</b> (“H.S. ASYNC INTRFCE”) to support facsimile or external display screen operations. In addition, the application processor <b>48</b> may communicate data to an RS-232/RS-485 serial interface module <b>34</b> (“SERIAL INTERFACE”). However, it should be realized that certain communications operations, such as outgoing communications to a printer (not shown) for example, may occur under the control of the control processor <b>49</b>. Even when the application processor <b>48</b> selects data for communication to a line printer, a typical printer speed, except in a graphics mode, would be sufficiently slow to allow the application processor <b>48</b> to operate in an intermittent, power saving mode. FIG. 6 consequently shows a second RS-232/RS-485 interface <b>106</b> (“SERIAL INTRFCE”) coupled to a second data bus <b>107</b>, which is further communicatively coupled to the control processor <b>49</b> to support the above described data communication operation via the control processor <b>49</b>.</p>
    <p>The data bus <b>107</b> is further shown as being coupled via a bus extension <b>108</b> directly to the application processor <b>48</b>. The data bus extension <b>108</b> is particularly provided for direct data communication between the application processor and a data scanner <b>109</b> (“SCAN”), which may, for example, be a bar code reader. Because of the high rate at which data are generated by the operation of a data scanner, the data are most reliably received, processed and stored by the application processor <b>48</b>. A scanning operation may consequently involve the operation of both the application processor <b>48</b> and the control processor <b>49</b>. According to one embodiment of the control circuit <b>80</b>, the control processor <b>49</b> monitors the circuit function of the data scanner <b>109</b> to detect a control signal that indicates the event of a scanner trigger depression. The scanning operation results in a string of data appearing at the data bus <b>107</b> and the associated data bus <b>108</b>. Since the application processor <b>48</b> is likely to be idle at the time of the occurrence of a trigger signal, the control processor places a “wake-up” signal on the control signal line <b>98</b> to activate the application processor <b>48</b>. The control processor <b>49</b> further writes an 8-bit control character into the first latch <b>86</b>. Upon completion of loading the control character into the data latch <b>86</b>, the control processor <b>49</b> places a “one” signal on the character available line <b>91</b> to allow the application processor to read the control character from the latch <b>86</b>. The application processor reads and decodes the control character in accordance with protocol instructions read from the ROM memory <b>56</b>, for example. In the example of a scanner trigger indication, the decoded control character signals the forthcoming string of information to be received by the application processor <b>48</b> directly from the scanner <b>109</b> over the data bus <b>108</b>. Hence, in contrast to being conditioned for the event of receiving data from the keyboard <b>49</b> or from the radio <b>81</b> (which data might preferably be received over the data latch <b>86</b>), the application processor would in the event of scanned incoming data be conditioned to read the “event data” as a string of data directly from the data bus <b>108</b>. The term “event data” is used to describe data relating to an event. Any time event data requires processing, such event data would be routed to the application processor <b>48</b> either directly, as described with respect to the scanner data, or between the two processors <b>48</b> and <b>49</b>, such as by the circuit <b>67</b> or a similar interface circuit. It should be understood that conditioning the application processor to receive a string of data directly via the bus <b>108</b> need not be limited to the receipt of the scanner data. Such conditioning is contemplated for any use of the terminal <b>10</b> which requires a high volume of data to be received and processed within a short period of time. Upon completion of the scanning operation, a trigger release signal is loaded into the first latch and communicated from the control processor <b>49</b> to the application processor <b>48</b>. Upon receipt of the signal and completion of any data processing operations remaining as a result of the receipt of data via the data bus <b>108</b>, the application processor instructs the control processor to apply a “wake-up” signal to the control signal line <b>98</b> upon occurrence of any specified event requiring processing of data. Thus, in one embodiment, the control processor <b>49</b> continues to control the application processor <b>48</b> by transmitting control codes to selectively enable or disable the application processor <b>48</b> to directly receive data via the data bus <b>108</b>. The receipt of data by the application processor <b>48</b> is referred to as “direct” data input, since the contemplated transfer of data via the data latches <b>86</b> and <b>92</b> is bypassed.</p>
    <p>FIG. 2 shows schematically one embodiment of electrical components of an exemplary terminal unit <b>10</b>, and the interactive relationship of such components to the application processor <b>48</b> or the control processor <b>49</b>. FIG. 2 shows schematically a plurality of electrical components which are generally directly related to the functional elements discussed with respect to FIG. <b>6</b>. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, the application processor <b>48</b> directly controls the previously referred to high speed asynchronous communications interface <b>105</b> and the RS-232/485 standards serial interface <b>34</b>. The flash EPROM programmable read-only memory <b>58</b> is preferred to have no less than 256K byte storage capacity. The flash EPROM may supplement or even replace standard ROM, such as memory <b>56</b>, which is preferred to have at least a 512K byte storage capacity. The ROM, if used, provides typical and normally non-variable data processing protocol instructions. Such ROM may include control instructions for standard display updating routines as well as for other routines which are typically implemented by standard keyboard instructions and which pertain to typical data input and output commands.</p>
    <p>The random access memory <b>56</b> may be a semi-permanent static RAM type circuit. The memory may have a capacity of 512K bytes. The preferred data storage capacity provides sufficient storage for an on-board data base related to typical inventory or delivery route type information. In view of the portability of the terminal unit <b>10</b>, an unexpected loss of battery power may bring about a significant loss of information unless the stored data are protected from destruction until full battery power is restored. For example, the terminal unit <b>10</b> may be returned at an initial signal of “low battery” to a battery charger unit (not shown) for a recharging operation and any stored data may be transferred, even while the battery <b>23</b> is being recharged, from the terminal unit <b>10</b> to a host computer (not shown).</p>
    <p>Display <b>20</b> may be a graphic display having an array of 48×100 pixels. Typical menu or special graphic screen data may be pre-established for a particular terminal unit <b>10</b> or for an application group of such units and may be stored initially in the specific ROM <b>56</b> provided for the particular unit or units <b>10</b>. As previously discussed, the updating of displayed data on the screen device <b>20</b> requires a significant amount of data processing. Typically, such data processing operations involve accessing permanently stored screen display information, such as from the ROM <b>56</b> or from the flash EPROM <b>58</b>, the manipulation of such information, and temporary storage of such manipulated information in the random access memory <b>57</b>. As shown in FIG. 2, the application processor <b>48</b> has direct functional control over the respective devices responsible for such data updating manipulations.</p>
    <p>Contrast control is another function which is desirable in LCD display screen <b>20</b>. In regards to FIG. 2, such a control may be integrally coupled to the VGA adapter circuit <b>54</b>. The contrast of the LCD display screen <b>20</b> is typically set and adjusted by an operator and is a matter of choice. The contrast may be adjusted, for example, by a typical key depression or by a keyboard sequence given by an operator. Such control input executions are within the scope of operations of the control processor <b>49</b>. Thus, in response to an appropriate command from the keyboard <b>102</b>, the display contrast may be changed without activating the application processor <b>48</b>. The contrast display may be controlled as indicated in FIG. 2 by the functional coupling of the keyboard circuit <b>102</b> to the control processor <b>49</b>, and the further coupling of the processor <b>48</b> to the contrast control circuit and then directly to the LCD display screen circuit <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, the LCD display screen <b>20</b> is equipped with a backlighting drive <b>62</b>. Many warehouse operations, route delivery operations and even merchandising inventory operations are often performed under sufficiently poor lighting conditions, thereby requiring a backlighting source to be supplied as a standard feature of the LCD display screen <b>20</b>. A backlight drive circuit <b>62</b> may be coupled through the MBUS <b>50</b> to the control processor <b>49</b>. A backlight drive circuit for use in conjunction with the exemplary terminal unit <b>10</b> is described in copending patent application by S. E. Koenck et al., Ser. No. 07/776,059, filed on Oct. 11, 1991, which application is assigned to the assignee of the present application. Both the application processor <b>48</b> and the control processor <b>49</b> may interact with the backlight drive circuit <b>62</b> to provide for an operator controlled brightness control sequence to be communicated to the backlight drive <b>62</b>.</p>
    <p>It should be realized that the control circuit <b>67</b> as an ASIC may also include, besides the timing function circuits for the real time clock and its functions, the clocking signals to each of the two processors <b>48</b> and <b>49</b>. The control circuit <b>67</b> may also provide the already described data communication functions between the application processor <b>48</b> and the control processor <b>49</b>, as represented in FIG. 6 by the two latching circuits <b>86</b> and <b>92</b>. The function by the control processor <b>49</b> to activate or “wake up” the application processor for data processing operations is accentuated in the representation of the “wake-up” feature by the separate function line <b>98</b> in FIG. <b>2</b>. In one contemplated embodiment, the control circuit <b>67</b> may include integrally a switching circuit function for separately switching the application processor <b>48</b> off or on, as indicated in FIG. 9 by the function blocks “#1 OFF WAIT” and “#1 ON”. A switch in the integrated control circuit <b>67</b> may perform the switching operation by selectively interrupting and reestablishing the clocking signal to the application processor <b>48</b>. In another embodiment, the application processor <b>48</b> may provide a shutdown status signal to the control processor <b>49</b> and shut itself down. The control processor <b>49</b> subsequently returns the application processor <b>48</b> to an active state upon occurrence of any event which requires the operation of the application processor <b>48</b>. The process flow diagram of FIG. 9 generally depicts operational procedures between the application processor <b>48</b> and the control processor <b>49</b>.</p>
    <p>Further in reference to FIG. 2, a trigger control signal of the scanner module <b>41</b> may be received by the control processor <b>49</b>. However the data flow from the scanner module <b>41</b> would be received directly by the application processor <b>48</b> for further processing and storage. Input signals which are received at speeds within the operational capability of the control processor <b>49</b> are received by and transferred through the control processor <b>49</b>. For example, key depression signals from the keyboard <b>49</b> are generally received directly by the control processor <b>49</b>. The keyboard for the terminal unit <b>10</b> referenced herein, as indicated in FIG. 2, may be a 6×8 key matrix. Because the real time selection of a key by an operator is slow in comparison to the processing speed of even the slower control processor, the interpretation of which key has been selected may be made by the control processor <b>49</b>. An “event” indication character communicated to the application processor <b>48</b> may already reflect which of the available functions of a particular key has been selected. The preprocessing of slow occurring events limits the operational periods of the application processor <b>48</b>.</p>
    <p>The control processor further controls an input to an audible alarm circuit <b>63</b> (“BUZZER”). An audible alarm, a slow occurring event, generates a signal to alert an operator of an alarm condition or to indicate that a processing operation has been completed. For example, when the application processor <b>48</b> has received a string of data from the scanner module <b>41</b>, and has further processed the received information to verify its correctness, the application processor <b>48</b> may communicate an acceptance code to the control processor <b>49</b> and be shut down from further operation. The control processor will then routinely generate an audible signal to alert the operator that the information has been accepted. Prior to communicating the acceptance code to the control processor, the application processor may retrieve from its memory <b>57</b>, for example, information relating to the bar code which has just been read and accepted, and may compile an information screen displaying such retrieved information to the operator prior to the deactivation of the application processor <b>48</b>. Thus, by the time the operator is alerted by the audible signal that the respective bar code has been read and accepted, the pertinent information regarding the item represented by the bar code is already displayed on the LCD display screen <b>20</b>.</p>
    <p>Other devices which may be under direct control of the control processor <b>49</b> are the radio <b>81</b> with its included radio interface (“RADIO INTERFACE”), and the power control circuit <b>64</b> (“CHARGE/POWER CONTROL”) of the terminal unit <b>10</b>. A serial interface <b>34</b> (“RS-232/RS-485 SERIAL INTERFACE”) may optionally be controlled by the control processor <b>49</b>. Because of the power savings achieved by the described interaction between the application processor <b>48</b> and the control processor <b>49</b>, various other devices or functions may be added to the general operation of the terminal unit <b>10</b> without unduly limiting its operational cycle.</p>
    <p>The interaction between the control processor <b>49</b> and the application processor <b>48</b> is described in greater detail in reference to both FIG. 2 and 9. In general, as discussed above, the application processor performs data processing operations, while the control processor <b>49</b> performs input-output control operations, which include periodic monitoring functions. The control processor <b>49</b> controls the activation or reactivation of the application processor <b>48</b>. However, the application processor <b>48</b> processes the parameters and feeds to the control processor <b>49</b> the respective instructions that control the control processor <b>49</b>. The application processor <b>48</b> is therefore, according to one embodiment, the one device which accesses the operations protocol of the terminal unit <b>10</b> from either the ROM or the flash EPROM devices <b>56</b> or <b>58</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 9, the depression of the power switch by an operator, physically starts the terminal unit with a cold start at a block <b>301</b>. The turn-on starts the clocking signal and the reset of both the control and application processors <b>48</b> and <b>49</b>. The control processor <b>49</b> may reset the application processor <b>48</b> at a block <b>303</b>. The reset operation starts the apparatus at a block <b>305</b> with an initialization sequence of communications between the application processor <b>48</b> and the control processor <b>49</b>. During the initialization, the application processor <b>48</b> retrieves from its program storage default values, such as for a battery threshold value, and transfers the respective default value to the control processor <b>49</b> at a block <b>307</b>. The control processor retains the default value and uses it in its further operations to operate the power control circuit <b>64</b>. Other initialization functions may be performed, such as, for example, setting an initial contrast value on the LCD screen display <b>20</b> at a block <b>309</b>, and determining whether or not the backlighting function is to be activated at a block <b>311</b>. The application processor <b>48</b> further may retrieve data from memory <b>56</b>, <b>57</b> or <b>58</b>, and manipulate such data in a manner to indicate on the screen that the unit <b>10</b> is operational. Once the terminal unit <b>10</b> is initialized, the application processor <b>48</b> communicates to the control processor <b>49</b> that it is assuming its rest state at a block <b>313</b>, and is shut off pending the occurrence of an event.</p>
    <p>Upon occurrence of an event at a block <b>315</b>, such as a “battery low indication” or the depression of a key by an operator, the control processor <b>49</b> causes the application processor <b>48</b> to turn at a block <b>317</b>. Typically the clock signal to the application processor <b>48</b> may be provided by a control signal applied to the control device <b>67</b>, or the application processor may be otherwise enabled, such as by an enable signal applied to the control signal line <b>98</b>. Upon being activated, the application processor <b>48</b> communicates with the control processor <b>49</b>, such as via the interface circuit <b>24</b> as described above with respect to FIG. 6, to request at a block <b>319</b> data relevant to the type of event that has occurred. After receiving the respective communication from the control processor <b>49</b>, the application processor <b>48</b> tests the received information as to the type of event and proceeds to process data as required according to the program. FIG. 9 shows three typical events of a large number of possible programmed events for which the application processor <b>48</b> may be activated. A typical key depression detected at a block <b>321</b> may result in reading the value of the depressed key, at a block <b>323</b>, from the second data latch <b>92</b> as described with respect to FIG. 6, or from an equivalent register of the control device <b>67</b> in FIG. <b>2</b>. The information then results in the retrieval of data regarding the addresses of pixels which will be changed to a logical “high” to depict the information on the LCD display screen <b>20</b>, at a block <b>325</b> the respective data being transferred to the respective circuit elements of the display screen <b>20</b>. Thereafter, the application processor communicates to the control processor <b>49</b> that the instructions have been executed and is shut down to await a further activation by an event at block <b>315</b> and an instruction at block <b>317</b>. The shutdown of the application processor <b>48</b> may be initiated either by the application processor <b>48</b> itself or by the control processor <b>49</b>. Because the start-up or activation of the application processor <b>48</b> is initiated by the control processor <b>49</b>, it may be desirable to disable the application processor <b>48</b> through the control processor <b>49</b>.</p>
    <p>Another typical event for activating the application processor <b>48</b> may be the detection of a low battery indication at a block <b>327</b> in response to a threshold value transferred by the application processor <b>48</b> to the control processor <b>49</b> during the described start-up procedure. The protocol may require that the application processor <b>48</b> verify the low battery indication by providing its own comparison check at a block <b>329</b>. Because of an impending shutdown due to a low battery indication, the application processor may complete any operation if the low battery indication is still within tolerable limits or may suspend further data processing because of risk of errors. The application processor may further display a low battery indication on the LCD display screen <b>20</b> at a block <b>331</b> and then be shut off pending further event instruction as described above.</p>
    <p>Another type event may be a special function key instruction such as the indication that a menu operation has been selected at a block <b>333</b>. The application processor <b>48</b> proceeds to access a designated program routine corresponding to the requested menu choice (“RETRIEVE MENU DATA”). The respective program instructions are executed at a block <b>337</b>, and the result or completion of the routine is displayed on the LCD display screen <b>20</b> at a block <b>339</b>. The displayed result may be preceded by a repetitive interactive data transfer between the application processor <b>48</b> and the control processor <b>49</b>, for example, when the menu choice requires the transmission of displayed information to a host computer. In such an event the application processor <b>48</b> may transfer the displayed information character by character to the control processor <b>49</b>. The control processor <b>49</b> in turn activates the radio interface and transfers the information string to the radio interface to be transmitted in accordance with the program instructions interpreted by the application processor <b>48</b>. FIG. 9 shows an error trap at a block <b>341</b> to which the program instructions proceed if an event code is not recognized by the programmed event descriptions and resulting processing routines of the application processor <b>48</b> for the particular application of the terminal unit <b>10</b>. The data processing operations performed by the application processor <b>48</b> generally require less than 10 milliseconds. Thus, on the average, operations including the processing of keystrokes and the associated display manipulations require less than one fiftieth of the average operational period of the terminal unit <b>10</b>. Substantial power savings are consequently achieved by selectively de-activating and re-activating the application processor <b>48</b> for preprogrammed events which require the execution of the respective data manipulations at a speed not obtainable by the control processor <b>49</b>.</p>
    <p>Further in reference to FIG. 9, if none of the event tests recognize the particular code supplied to the application processor <b>48</b>, an event error trap routine at block <b>341</b> is used to inform the operator of the error condition. Such a routine may, for example, instruct the operator to again enter the most recently requested operation, and may include an audible warning from the buzzer. Various changes in the described control sequence may be implemented. Certain routines may be implemented at the described slower speed by the control processor <b>49</b> directly, while the application processor <b>48</b> remains deactivated. Further, other microprocessor devices may be chosen for the application and control processors, respectively. The described microprocessor devices are particularly suitable for various operations that are performed by the terminal unit <b>10</b> in the above-referred to operations.</p>
    <p>FIG. 10 illustrates a portion of the software protocol stack <b>401</b> that runs on one of Norand Corporation's Portable Data Collection Terminal Units, Model No. TM 1100 (See attached APPENDICES B and C). Specifically, the MAC (Medium Access Control) layer <b>403</b> is responsible for providing reliable data transmission between the terminal unit and any other node or device in a mobile computer network. When a radio module (e.g., Norand RM40 RF Module) is attached to the terminal unit and powered up, the MAC layer <b>403</b> and a Glue Logic Layer <b>405</b> are transferred to flash memory in the radio module. The Glue Logic Layer <b>405</b> controls the microprocessor in the radio module so that it is able to communicate with the high speed main microprocessor of the terminal unit. Generally, the Bridge Layer <b>407</b> organizes the nodes or terminals of the mobile computer network into an optimal spanning, routes data between any two nodes or terminals in the network, and provides data package storage to facilitate sleeping terminals. Appendix D provides an exemplary computer program listing of the software protocol stack <b>401</b> of FIG. 10 (Bridge Layer at pp. 1-33; MAC Layer at pp. 34-51; Glue Logic Layer at pp. 52-59). These protocol layers are actually subgroupings of the protocol stacks illustrated in FIGS <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C.</p>
    <p>FIG. 11 shows an exemplary local area network (LAN) illustrating the roaming characteristics of the portable data collection terminals. Specifically, the illustrated LAN consists of a host computer <b>510</b>, multiple access points <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b> and a mobile computing device (MCD) <b>518</b>. The MCD <b>518</b>, a portable data collection terminal, is communicatively coupled to the host computer <b>510</b> through an access point <b>512</b>. Although only one MCD, MCD <b>518</b>, is shown typically a plurality of MCDs would exist on the LAN. The MCD <b>518</b> communicates with the host computer <b>510</b> through the access point <b>512</b> to which it is connected.</p>
    <p>The MCD <b>518</b> is preferably one of a plurality of MCDs (not shown) in the LAN. The MCD <b>518</b> communicates with the host computer <b>510</b> through the access point <b>512</b> to which it is connected.</p>
    <p>In a preferred embodiment, mobile computing devices remain in a sleep mode, where their radio is powered down, except when they are actually communicating with the host computer <b>510</b> or when they periodically awaken to synchronize with an access point.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, the MCD <b>518</b> remains in a fixed position, and maintains a wireless RF link to the access point <b>512</b>. However, in another embodiment, the MCD <b>518</b> is capable of roaming between access point coverage areas, and may disconnect the RF link with the access point <b>512</b> in favor of connection with a different access point <b>514</b>.</p>
    <p>The MCD <b>518</b> and the access point <b>512</b> communicate in a structured manner, where the MCD <b>518</b> transmits a request-for-poll (RFP), the access point <b>12</b> responds with a poll, the MCD <b>518</b> then transmits its data, and the access point <b>512</b> responds with an acknowledge (ACK) signal if the data message is finished or with another poll if there is still more data to be transmitted. One data message from the MCD <b>18</b> to the access point <b>512</b> may consist of several POLL-DATA sequences, where each DATA transmission is a fragment of the entire data message. In this context, a maximum interpoll gap time is defined as the maximum time between poll messages transmitted from the access point <b>512</b> to the MCD <b>518</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 12 shows the process implemented by a mobile computing device when it has a message to transmit to the host computer. A MCD wakes up at a block <b>551</b> when it has a data message to transmit to the host computer. This wake-up can occur at any possible moment in time, i.e., a random time. After waking up, the MCD senses, at a block <b>553</b>, the communications channel for a predetermined time, which is greater than or equal to the maximum interpoll gap time. In this context, a maximum interpoll gap time is defined as the maximum time between poll messages transmitted from the access point to the MCD. This assures the MCD that a transmission from the access point to another MCD will occur within the sensing time if the channel is currently being used. If, at a block <b>555</b>, the channel is clear for the interpoll gap time, the MCD transmits a RFP at a block <b>559</b>, and the communications sequence begins. If, at block <b>555</b>, the channel is busy during the interpoll gap time, the MCD waits a fixed time period at a block <b>557</b> and senses the channel at block <b>553</b> as before.</p>
    <p>Because the MCD wakes up at some random time to send data to the host, the probability of collision with the transmission of another MCD is extremely small. By sensing the channel for a fixed period of time and waiting for a fixed period of time to retry transmission, the random nature of transmission attempts is retained even after a busy channel is sensed. For a collision to occur in this scenario, two MCDs would have to wake up at the exact same moment in time, the probability of which is extremely small.</p>
    <p>FIG. 13 shows a process similar to that of FIG. 12, except that a retry counter implementation is used. Upon waking up to transmit at a block <b>601</b>, a MCD resets a retry counter to zero at a block <b>603</b>, indicating that it is the first attempt to communicate on the channel. If, at block <b>607</b>, the channel is determined to be clear for the interpoll gap time, the MCD transmits an RFP at a block <b>609</b>, and the communications sequence begins. Each time the channel is sensed at a block <b>605</b> and is determined to be busy at block <b>607</b>, the retry counter is incremented at a block <b>611</b>. Once the retry counter reaches a predetermined MAX value at a block <b>613</b>, the MCD stops trying to transmit and goes back to sleep for some relatively long period of time at a block <b>615</b> before trying to transmit again. If instead, the predetermined MAX value has not been reached at the block <b>613</b>, the MCD may either wait or sleep for a predetermined or fixed time before trying to access the channel again. This channel access protocol allows a terminal, an MCD, to save power if the channel is heavily loaded by sleeping until the channel may be less heavily loaded.</p>
    <p>FIG. 14 shows the process implemented by a mobile computing device in a configuration where the MCD may be roaming between coverage areas and disconnecting and reconnecting with different access points (as is illustrated in FIG. <b>11</b>). In this situation, access points periodically transmit SYNC messages, so that a MCD which is roaming, or has been sleeping for an extended period of time, can connect to the proper base station and synchronize its clock so that it knows when further SYNC messages will occur. In this embodiment, therefore, after waking at a block <b>651</b>, the MCD listens to receive a SYNC message <b>653</b>, <b>655</b> and <b>657</b> before attempting to transmit on the communications channel, since it may have awakened in the coverage area of a different access point. Thus, the amount of time, at a block <b>657</b>, between wakeup and channel sensing or between a busy channel sense and a further channel sense should be greater than or equal to the time between SYNC messages minus the maximum interpoll gap time. This assures that a SYNC message will be received each time before the MCD attempts to sense the channel and transmit. In addition, after receiving a sync signal, the MCD listens for an interpoll gap time <b>659</b> to determine if the channel is clear, at blocks <b>659</b> and <b>661</b>. If clear, the MCD transmits an RFP at a block <b>663</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 15 shows a process similar to that of FIG. 14, except that a retry counter implementation is used to control the number of retry counter implementation is used to control the number of retry attempts. Upon waking up to transmit at a block <b>701</b>, a MCD resets a retry counter to zero at a block <b>703</b>, indicating that it is the first attempt to communicate on the channel. Each time the channel is sensed and is determined to be busy, the retry counter is incremented at a block <b>717</b>. Once the retry counter reaches a predetermined MAX value at a block <b>719</b>, the MCD stops trying to transmit and goes back to sleep at a block <b>723</b>, for some relatively long period of time before trying to transmit again. This procedure allows a terminal to save power if the channel is heavily loaded by sleeping until the channel may be less heavily loaded. In addition, if the channel is busy but the retry counter has not reached the MAX value, the MCD may either sleep or wait for a fixed period of time at a block <b>721</b>. Although a fixed period of time is desirable, a random or pseudo-random back-off might also be used.</p>
    <p>FIG. 16 is a flow diagram illustrating a channel access protocol using a pseudo-random number generator according to another embodiment of the present invention. Upon waking up to transmit at a block <b>751</b>, a MCD generates a pseudo-random number (e.g., 5-8 microseconds) at a block <b>753</b>. The MCD then senses the communication channel for a few microseconds at a block <b>755</b>. If the channel is determined to be clear at a block <b>757</b>, the MCD determines whether the pseudo-random time period has expired at a block <b>757</b>. If it has expired, the MCD transmits an RFP at a block <b>761</b>, and the communications sequence begins. If the pseudo-random time period has not expired, the MCD again senses the communication channel for a few microseconds determined at a block <b>755</b> to determine if the channel is clear at block <b>757</b>, i.e., repeating the above.</p>
    <p>If the channel is determined to be busy at block <b>757</b>, the MCD increments a retry counter at a block <b>763</b>. If the retry counter has not reached a predetermined maximum value at a block <b>765</b>, the MCD waits for a pseudo-random time (e.g., 10 milliseconds) at a block <b>769</b> and then generates another pseudo-random number at block <b>753</b> and repeats the above procedure. Once the retry counter reaches the predetermined maximum value, at block <b>765</b>, the MCD quits trying to transmit and goes to sleep for a longer period of time at a block <b>767</b>, before awakening against at block <b>751</b> to retry the transmission.</p>
    <p>FIG. 17 shows the basic communication structure in one embodiment of the present invention. Access points periodically transmit a series of SYNC messages 809-813, while allowing time for communication exchanges during the periods 815-819 between SYNC messages. In general, the SYNC message itself takes much less time than the amount of time allocated for communication between SYNC messages. The time allocated for a SYNC message and for subsequent terminal communication (i.e., until another SYNC message is transmitted) is depicted by periods 803-807.</p>
    <p>FIG. 18 shows a series of exemplary communication exchanges and channel access attempts where three MCDs are attempting to communicate in the same general time frame. The three units attempting to communicate are referred to as unit <b>1</b>, unit <b>2</b>, and unit <b>3</b>. Unit <b>1</b> wakes up first at <b>831</b>, in the first time interval <b>815</b>. It must wait until it receives a SYNC message at <b>811</b>, so it cannot attempt to transmit in time interval <b>815</b>. Unit <b>2</b> is the next to wake up at <b>833</b>, also in time interval <b>815</b>. As with unit <b>1</b>, unit <b>2</b> cannot transmit until a SYNC <b>811</b> is received, and therefore cannot transmit in time interval <b>815</b>.</p>
    <p>After the timer set by unit <b>1</b> when it initially woke up expires, SYNC message <b>811</b> has been received by unit <b>1</b>. Thus, unit <b>1</b> can listen to the communications channel at <b>841</b> for the maximum interpoll gap time, determine a clear channel, and begin its communications sequence at <b>843</b>, all in this time interval <b>817</b>. The timer initially set by unit <b>2</b> also expires during time interval <b>817</b>, and unit <b>2</b> has therefore received the SYNC message <b>811</b> and senses the communications channel at <b>847</b>. However, unit <b>1</b> has not yet finished its transmission when unit <b>2</b> senses the channel for the maximum interpoll gap time. Thus, unit <b>2</b> must defer transmission, and waits until time interval <b>819</b> to retry communication.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, also in time interval <b>817</b>, unit <b>3</b> initially wakes up to transmit at <b>845</b>. Unit <b>3</b> must wait for a SYNC before attempting to transmit, so it does not transmit in the time interval <b>817</b>.</p>
    <p>In time interval <b>819</b>, after the SYNC message <b>813</b>, unit <b>2</b> and unit <b>3</b> have both received a SYNC message and can sense the channel to attempt transmission. In this case, unit <b>3</b> listens to the channel at <b>861</b> slightly before unit <b>2</b> senses the channel at <b>863</b>, such that the channel is not busy when unit <b>2</b> begins to sense the channel. However, after unit <b>3</b> has sensed the channel for the maximum interpoll gap time, it begins communication on the channel at <b>865</b>. Unit <b>2</b> finishes listening to the channel, also for the maximum interpoll gap time, after unit <b>3</b> has begun its communication, so unit <b>2</b> must defer communication. Finally, after SYNC message <b>869</b> in time interval <b>871</b>, unit <b>2</b> senses an idle channel at <b>873</b> and transmits its communication to the access point at <b>875</b>. Unit <b>2</b> ends its transmission at <b>877</b>. This sequence illustrates the interpoll gap time channel sense and the wait to transmit until after a SYNC message has been received.</p>
    <p>The operation of the protocol of the present invention takes advantage of the inherently random wake-up time of a mobile computing device in a local area communications network. Rather than performing a random back-off routine, the time of wake-up is used to ensure random communications attempts, thereby preventing collisions due to many terminals attempting to transmit immediately after a certain common event. This is done by preserving the random wake-up time, adding a fixed amount of time to the time of wake-up in back-off procedures. The protocol of the present invention eliminates the need for random number generation and the implementation of random back-off algorithms.</p>
    <p>FIG. 19 is a timing graph illustrating an exemplary communication exchange between a portable data terminal <b>901</b> and an access point <b>903</b>. Upon determining that the channel is clear, the portable data terminal <b>901</b> begins by transmitting an RFP (request for poll) frame <b>905</b>. After an interframe gap time <b>923</b>, the access point <b>903</b> responds with a POLL frame <b>907</b> to indicate to the portable data terminal <b>901</b> that it is available to receive data. The portable data terminal <b>901</b> then sends a DATA frame <b>909</b>. The access point <b>903</b> acknowledges receipt of DATA frame <b>909</b> with a POLL frame <b>911</b>. The portable data terminal <b>901</b> then transmits DATA frame <b>913</b> which indicates that data transmission is complete. The access point <b>915</b> then transmits a CLEAR frame <b>915</b> to acknowledge receipt.</p>
    <p>A channel reservation scheme is used to generally restrict channel access contention to RFP frames. Each frame transmitted during the communication exchange contains a channel reservation field (e.g., field <b>931</b> in POLL <b>907</b>) which may indicate either the number of outstanding frames or the amount of time required to transmit the outstanding frames.</p>
    <p>This scheme enables other terminals attempting to access the busy channel to determine the actual amount of time during which they may sleep. Sleeping, i.e., or powering-down the radio for the duration of the channel reservation period (i.e., until the channel becomes clear) conserves battery power and aids in collision avoidance. Further, channel reservation may be implemented with the other channel access embodiments discussed above during heavy communication traffic. In other words, channel reservation may supplement other channel access protocols when terminals using those protocols are continuously failing to gain access to the channel.</p>
    <p>FIG. 20 is a flow diagram illustrating an embodiment of the channel access reservation scheme described above. A portable data terminal (or mobile computer device (“MCD”) wakes up to transmit data at a block <b>951</b>. It then senses the channel for an interpoll gap time at a block <b>953</b> before determining if the channel is clear at a block <b>955</b>. If the channel is clear, the portable data terminal transmits an RFP and the communication sequence begins (e.g., that shown in FIG. <b>19</b>). If the channel is busy, the portable data terminal listens for the channel reservation information on the channel at a block <b>959</b>, and calculates the time that it should “sleep” and powers down at a block <b>961</b>. At the end of the calculated sleep period, the portable data terminal wakes up to transmit at a block <b>963</b> and repeats the process by sensing the channel for an interpoll gap time at block <b>953</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 21 shows a radio card <b>1110</b> and a receiving device <b>1111</b> built in accordance with the present invention. The radio card <b>10</b> has a housing <b>1113</b> inside which is a completely operation radio transceiver not shown. The receiving device <b>1111</b> in this embodiment of the present invention uses a pair of opposed slots <b>1114</b> to receive and guide the incoming radio card <b>1110</b>.</p>
    <p>The radio card <b>1110</b> has a pair of antenna contacts <b>1115</b> positioned along the edge of the housing <b>1113</b>. The receiving device <b>11</b> has a corresponding pair of antenna contacts <b>1116</b>. As can be seen in FIG. 22, when the radio card <b>10</b> is inserted into the receiving device <b>1111</b> the antenna contacts <b>1115</b> on the radio card housing <b>1113</b> electrically encounter the corresponding set of antenna contacts <b>1116</b> positioned on the receiving device <b>1111</b>. The antenna contacts <b>1116</b> on the receiving device <b>1111</b> are connected to an antenna cable <b>1118</b>. The antenna cable <b>1118</b> is in turn connected to an antenna not shown. Thus, when the radio card <b>1110</b> is completely inserted into the receiving device <b>1111</b> the radio card <b>1110</b> automatically is connected to an antenna.</p>
    <p>Referring again to FIG. 21, a radio card <b>1110</b> may have antenna contacts <b>20</b>, shown in dashed lines, located at different positions on the housing <b>1113</b>. Similarly, the receiving device <b>1111</b> may have several additional pairs of antenna contacts <b>22</b>. In other embodiments, the card <b>1110</b> and receiving device <b>1111</b> may have contacts to a modem or other wired hookup, or to an infrared antenna. The additional pairs of antenna contacts <b>22</b> on the receiving device <b>1113</b> can be used to allow access to several different antennas depending on the type and frequency of radio communication to be utilized by the radio card <b>1110</b>. This access is accomplished through additional antenna cables <b>1123</b> attached to the additional contacts <b>1122</b>. Thus, if the receiving device <b>1113</b> is part of a hand held computer terminal which has more than one antenna attached or built in, different pairs of contacts <b>1116</b> &amp; <b>1122</b> can be used to allow access by the radio card to the different antennas depending upon the frequency and range characteristics of each antenna. While a radio card <b>1110</b> may only operate at one frequency and thereby only need one antenna and therefore only have one pair of antenna contacts, the receiving device <b>1111</b> still may have several pairs of antenna contacts <b>1116</b> &amp; <b>1122</b> all but one of which do not correspond to any pair of radio card <b>1110</b> antenna contacts <b>1115</b>. In other embodiments, the card <b>1110</b> may operate multiple transceivers interchangeably or even simultaneously, allowing the receiving device <b>1113</b> to communicate on two or more mediums at the same time. For example, the card <b>1110</b> could implement radio frequency communication through an antenna and wired communication through a hookup to an RS232 port or an Ethernet port. Many other combinations of transceiver operation are possible and contemplated by the present invention.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIGS. 23 and 24, when the radio card <b>10</b> is inserted into the receiving device <b>1111</b> an interface between the radio card <b>1110</b> and the receiving device <b>1111</b> is produced. The receiving device <b>1111</b> has a plurality of pins <b>1130</b> which form the male portion of a connector. The radio card <b>1110</b> has a corresponding plurality of holes <b>1131</b> which form the female portion of the connector and which engage the pins <b>1130</b>. The pins <b>1130</b> are connected to the computer terminal not shown by a series of electrical connections <b>1133</b> such as wires or electrical ribbon. The holes <b>1131</b> in the radio card <b>1110</b> are electrically connected to the radio. When the pins <b>1130</b> are engaged in the holes <b>1131</b>, electrical signals can be exchanged between the radio card <b>1110</b> and the computer terminal. The electrical signals can be in the form of information exchange, power supply or both.</p>
    <p>The radio card <b>1110</b> of FIGS. 21-24 might also be a modem card not shown. In this embodiment, the connections would be the same as previously described with the only difference being that instead of the contacts connecting the modem card to a radio antenna, the modem card would be connected to a traditional telephone line, a cellular phone or an antenna for a cellular phone if the cellular phone was built within the modem card.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIGS. 25 and 26, a computer terminal <b>1140</b> is shown built in accordance with the present invention. The computer terminal <b>1140</b> has a slot <b>1142</b> for receiving a radio card <b>1144</b>. The user of the computer terminal <b>1140</b> lifts up a flexible cover <b>1146</b> and inserts the radio card <b>1144</b> into the slot <b>1142</b>. The radio card <b>1144</b> engages with the computer terminal <b>1140</b> in a similar manner as described in FIGS. 21-24. The radio card <b>1144</b> as a pair of antenna contacts <b>1148</b> which will engage with a corresponding pair of contacts inside the computer terminal <b>1140</b>. The pair of antenna contacts inside the computer terminal are connected to a radio antenna not shown.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 27, another embodiment of the present invention is shown. The radio card <b>1150</b> has two pairs of antenna contacts <b>1152</b> &amp; <b>1153</b> which will encounter respectively two pair of antenna contacts <b>1155</b> &amp; not shown on the receiving device <b>1158</b>. This embodiment accommodates a radio card <b>50</b> which can operate at two different frequencies which require two different antennas. Standardization of antenna contact position with antenna type is anticipated and covered by the present invention.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIGS. 28-32, another embodiment of a computer terminal <b>1160</b> built in accordance with the present invention is shown. The computer terminal <b>1160</b> has a removable end cap <b>1162</b>. When the end cap <b>1162</b> is removed, a slot <b>1160</b> is revealed which is used to receive a radio card <b>1166</b>. The slot <b>1164</b> in the computer terminal <b>1160</b> has three pairs of antenna contacts <b>1167</b>, <b>1168</b> and <b>1169</b> which are respectively connected to three different radio antennas <b>1171</b>, <b>1172</b> and <b>1173</b>. The radio card <b>1166</b> in this embodiment only has one pair of antenna contacts <b>1175</b>. Thus, when the radio card <b>1166</b> is inserted into the slot <b>1164</b>, the antenna contacts <b>1175</b> will match up to the antenna contacts <b>1167</b> and the radio will utilize the internal antenna <b>1171</b>. The external antenna <b>1173</b> and the other internal antenna <b>1172</b> will not be used by this particular radio card <b>1166</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 33, still another embodiment of a computer terminal <b>1180</b> built in accordance with the present invention is shown. A communication card <b>1185</b> is inserted into the computer terminal <b>1180</b>. The card <b>1185</b> can be a radio card, a modem card, a wired communication card, an infrared card, or a card containing more than one of the above transceivers. The card <b>1185</b> has a set or pair of contacts <b>1187</b> which encounter a set or pair of contacts <b>1188</b> disposed on the receiving portion of the computer terminal <b>1180</b>. The contacts <b>1188</b> are electrically connected to a switching matrix <b>1190</b>, thus the radio card or modem card <b>1185</b> is electrically connected to the switching matrix <b>1190</b>.</p>
    <p>The switching matrix <b>1190</b> is connected to a plurality of antennas <b>1192</b>, <b>1193</b> and <b>1194</b> and to a telephone jack <b>1195</b>. In other embodiments, the switching matrix <b>1190</b> may additionally be connected to an Ethernet port or additional antennas to accommodate infrared communication. The switching matrix <b>1190</b> is used to electrically and selectively connect the radio or modem card <b>1185</b> to the appropriate antenna or to a wired or telephone line. The switching matrix <b>1190</b> is controlled by the control microprocessor <b>1198</b> of the computer terminal <b>1180</b>. The control microprocessor interrogates the card <b>1185</b> to determine what kind of card it is and to determine what antenna or telephone connection it needs. The control microprocessor then signals the switching matrix <b>1190</b> which connects the card <b>1185</b> to the appropriate antenna <b>1192</b>, <b>1193</b> or <b>1194</b>, to the phone jack <b>1195</b>, or to any other appropriate port or antenna.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 34, <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> illustrate another embodiment wherein a computer device <b>1211</b> utilizes a radio card <b>1210</b> built in accordance with the present invention. The computer device <b>1211</b> has a housing <b>1212</b>. Inside the radio card <b>1210</b> is a completely operation radio transceiver not shown. The computer device <b>1211</b> has an opening <b>1214</b> in the housing <b>1212</b> through which the radio card <b>1210</b> can be inserted into the computer device <b>1212</b>. In the present embodiment of the invention, the receiving means for the computer device is a slot <b>1215</b>.</p>
    <p>When the radio card <b>1210</b> is inserted into the slot <b>1215</b> in the computer device <b>1211</b> an interface between the radio card <b>1210</b> and the computer device <b>1211</b> is produced. The computer device <b>1211</b> has a plurality of pins not shown which form the male portion of a connector. The radio card <b>1210</b> has a corresponding plurality of holes not shown which form the female portion of the connector and which engage the pins. The pins are connected internally and electrically to the computer device <b>1211</b> by a series of electrical connections such as wires or electrical ribbon. The holes in the radio card <b>1210</b> are electrically connected to the radio transceiver. When the pins engage the holes, electrical signals can be exchanged between the radio transceiver inside the radio card <b>10</b> and the computer device <b>1211</b>. The electrical signals can be in the form of information exchange, power supply or both. The radio card <b>1210</b> includes antenna contacts <b>1217</b> to engage corresponding radio antenna contacts that are connected to an appropriate antenna.</p>
    <p>The computer device <b>1211</b> includes a cap <b>1220</b> which is designed to matingly engage the opening <b>1215</b> in the housing <b>1212</b> of the computer device <b>1211</b> and thereby cover the slot <b>1215</b> used to receive the radio card <b>1210</b>. A flexible band <b>1222</b> attaches the cap <b>1222</b> to the housing <b>1212</b> of the computer device <b>1211</b>. One end of the band <b>1222</b> is connected to the cap <b>1222</b> while the other end is attached to the housing <b>1212</b>. A handle <b>1224</b> helps assist the removal of the cap <b>1220</b> from the housing <b>1212</b> of the computer device <b>1211</b>.</p>
    <p>The cap <b>1220</b> is constructed of a closed cell foam material with high air content for low dielectric losses. Alternatively, a quality dielectric material may be used to reduce the size of the antenna structure. The cap <b>1220</b> when made of a foam material helps to protect the radio card from the physical trauma typically associated with computer devices of these types. Additionally, as will be discussed in further detail below, the cap <b>1220</b> helps to environmentally seal the opening <b>1214</b> preventing harmful material from the outside such as dust or moisture from reaching the radio card <b>1210</b> and helps to reduce the escape of electronic noise from the housing <b>1212</b> created by the radio card <b>1210</b> and computer device <b>1211</b>. As will be discussed below, a grounded metal shield covering a portion of the cap <b>1220</b> is used to reduce the escape of electronic noise.</p>
    <p>While the cap <b>1220</b> helps to seal the opening, protect the radio card <b>1210</b> and hold the radio card in place, the primary function of the cap is to provide the radio card <b>1210</b> access to an appropriate antenna or antennas. The connection of the radio card <b>1210</b> to the antenna is made through the cap <b>1220</b>. The antenna or antennas can be embedded in the cap <b>1220</b>, embedded in the band <b>1222</b> or even attached to, mounted on, or embedded in the housing <b>1212</b> of the computer device <b>1211</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIGS. 37 and 38, a computer device <b>1230</b> built in accordance with the present invention is shown with a cap <b>1234</b> engaged in the opening of the housing <b>1232</b> wherein a radio card can be inserted. A band <b>1236</b> is attached to both the cap <b>1234</b> and the housing <b>1232</b>. The band <b>1236</b> helps prevent the loss of the cap <b>1234</b> when the cap <b>1234</b> is not engaged in the housing <b>1232</b> of the computer device <b>1230</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIGS. 39 and 40, the cap <b>1232</b> is shown engaged with the housing <b>1232</b> of the computer device <b>1230</b>. The cap <b>1234</b> includes an outwardly extending lip <b>1236</b> which helps to environmentally seal the opening in the housing <b>1232</b> preventing harmful material from the outside such as dust or moisture from reaching the radio card <b>1240</b> which has been inserted into the computer device <b>1230</b>. When the cap <b>1234</b> is completely inserted or fully engaged in the housing <b>1232</b>, the lip <b>1235</b> sealingly engages the housing <b>1232</b>.</p>
    <p>Embedded in the cap <b>1234</b> is an antenna <b>1250</b>. The antenna <b>1250</b> is connected to the radio card <b>1240</b> through contacts <b>1251</b> and <b>1252</b> disposed on the cap <b>1234</b> and contacts <b>1241</b> and <b>1242</b> disposed on the radio card <b>1240</b>. Contact <b>1252</b> is the ground contact for the antenna <b>1250</b> and is connected to the end of the antenna <b>1250</b>. Contact <b>1242</b> is the ground contact for the radio card <b>1240</b>. Contact <b>1251</b> is the signal contact and is connected to the antenna <b>1250</b> a short distance from the end of the antenna <b>1250</b>. Contact <b>1241</b> is the signal contact for the radio card <b>1240</b>.</p>
    <p>Contact <b>1251</b> and contact <b>1241</b> are disposed on the cap <b>1234</b> and the radio card <b>1240</b>, respectively, such that the contacts engage each other when the cap <b>1234</b> is inserted into or engaged with the housing <b>1232</b> of the computer device <b>1230</b>. Similarly, contact <b>1252</b> and contact <b>1242</b> are disposed on the cap <b>1234</b> and the radio card <b>1240</b>, respectively, such that the contacts engage each other when the cap <b>1234</b> is inserted into or engaged with the housing <b>1232</b> of the computer device <b>1230</b>. The contacts shown in the present embodiment are of the metal button type wherein the connection is made when the two metal surfaces meet. Many variations of the contacts are possible including the use of male/female connections and spring type contacts.</p>
    <p>A shield <b>1248</b> is disposed around the bottom portion of the cap <b>1234</b> and is used to reduce the escape of electronic noise. Typically in computer devices of this type, the inside of the housing of the computer device is shielded. Additionally, the area immediately surrounding the radio device such as a radio card may also be shielded. By shielding the cap <b>1234</b>, the integrity of the housing and radio shields are not breached by the opening used to insert and remove the radio card. The shield <b>1248</b> is connected to the antenna ground contact <b>1252</b> on the cap <b>1234</b>. A hole <b>1259</b> in the shield <b>1248</b> allows the signal contacts <b>1251</b> and <b>1241</b> to engage without being grounded.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 41, the cap <b>1234</b> is shown embedded within which are two antennas <b>1260</b> and <b>1262</b> designed to receive and transmit different radio frequency signals. The first antenna <b>60</b> and the second antenna <b>1262</b> are both connected to a common ground contact <b>1267</b> which is connected to the shield and which engages the ground contact <b>1277</b> on the radio card <b>1270</b>. The first antenna <b>1260</b> is connected to a first signal contact <b>1265</b> and is disposed on the cap <b>1234</b> to engage a first signal contact <b>1275</b> disposed on the radio card <b>1270</b>. Similarly, the second antenna <b>1262</b> is connected to a second signal contact <b>1266</b> and is disposed on the cap <b>1234</b> to engage a second signal contact <b>1276</b> disposed on the radio card <b>1270</b>. Thus the radio card <b>1270</b> will use a signal via contact <b>1275</b> or via contact <b>1276</b> depending upon which antenna it would like to use. Which antenna it would like to use is dependent upon the desired frequency upon which it want to transmit and receive.</p>
    <p>The radio card <b>1270</b> as shown has three contacts <b>1275</b>, <b>1276</b> and <b>1277</b>. However, if the radio transceiver in the radio card <b>1270</b> is designed such that it would only be able to transmit and receive signals which correspond to the first antenna <b>1260</b>, then it would not need to have contact <b>1276</b> and it could be left off. Similarly, if the radio card <b>1270</b> were only going to use second antenna <b>1262</b> then contact <b>1275</b> could be omitted. Thus, standardizing contact position with respect to antenna type allows for flexibility in cap usage with various radio cards such that only appropriate antennas will be connected to the radio card.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 42, two antennas <b>1280</b> and <b>1282</b> are embedded in the cap <b>1234</b>. In this embodiment built in accordance with the present invention, the two antennas <b>1280</b> and <b>1282</b> not only share a common ground contact <b>86</b> which engages the ground contact <b>1296</b> of the radio card <b>1290</b>, but they also share a common signal contact <b>1285</b> which engages the signal contact <b>1295</b> on the radio card <b>1290</b>. Thus, both antennas receive and transmit signals using the same two contacts. This embodiment requires a radio card <b>1290</b> which can filter the different signals and thus use the signal from the desired antenna while ignoring the signals which arrive via the other antenna.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 43, a computer device <b>1211</b> built in accordance with the present invention is shown which is designed to implement an antenna diversity scheme. A first antenna <b>1301</b> is embedded in the cap <b>1220</b>. A second antenna <b>1302</b> is shown embedded in the band <b>1222</b>. As discussed in the embodiment as shown in FIG. 8, the two antennas <b>1301</b> and <b>1302</b> share a common ground contact <b>1307</b>. The first antenna <b>1301</b> is connected to a signal contact <b>1305</b>. Likewise, the second antenna <b>1302</b> is connected to a signal contact <b>1306</b>. The hole <b>1249</b> in the shield <b>1248</b> which prevent the signal contacts <b>1305</b> and <b>1306</b> from grounding is shown in dashed lines.</p>
    <p>The first antenna <b>1301</b> is similar to the second antenna <b>1302</b> and both are designed to transmit and receive similar radio frequency signals. When the cap <b>1220</b> is engaged in the opening of the housing <b>1212</b>, the first antenna <b>1301</b> and the second antenna <b>1302</b> will be perpendicular with respect to each other. The quality of the signal received by the first antenna <b>1301</b> and the quality of the signal received by the second antenna <b>1302</b> may be greatly different since the antennas are place at right angles with respect to each other. In the present embodiment, the radio card can check the quality of each signal and use the antenna which is currently receiving the stronger signal. Additionally, it can switch to the other antenna when the conditions change such that the signal is no longer acceptable. Utilizing two similar antennas in this matter, antenna diversification, can be very important in computer terminals of this type since they are often mobile and are often subjected to a rapidly changing environment. An antenna diversification scheme of this type can be used to help eliminate the reception problems associated with signal multipath.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 44, another embodiment of the present invention is shown with the first antenna <b>1311</b> and the second antenna <b>1312</b> attached to the housing <b>1212</b> of the computer terminal <b>1211</b>. As in the embodiment shown in FIG. 43, the first antenna <b>1311</b> is similar to the second antenna <b>1312</b> and both are designed to transmit and receive similar radio frequency signals and are perpendicular with respect to each other such that an antenna diversity scheme can be implemented. The antennas <b>1311</b> and <b>1312</b> are connected to the contacts <b>1305</b>, <b>1306</b> and <b>1307</b> through the cap <b>1220</b> and though the band <b>1212</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 46, the embodiment of FIG. 44 is shown with the only differences being that the first antenna <b>1321</b> and the second antenna <b>1322</b> are positioned slightly differently and the antennas are designed to transmit and receive different radio frequency signals. Thus, the radio card uses the signal on contact <b>1305</b> when it wants to receive signals via the first antenna <b>1321</b> and uses the signal on contact <b>1306</b> when it wants to receive signal via the second antenna <b>1322</b>.</p>
    <p>In FIGS. 43, <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>, the portion of the connection between the contacts <b>1305</b>, <b>1306</b> and <b>1307</b> and the antennas which pass through the band <b>1212</b> are shown schematically as wires. In the best mode of the present invention, the transmission of the signal through the band <b>1212</b> would be accomplished through the use of a micro shield strip <b>1330</b> as shown in FIG. <b>45</b>. The micro shield strip consists of several conductive ribbons running the length of the band <b>1212</b> and separated by the non-conductive material of the band <b>1212</b>. A wide top ribbon <b>1333</b> and a wide bottom ribbon <b>1334</b> are used to sandwich two smaller ribbons <b>1336</b> and <b>1337</b>. The smaller ribbons <b>1336</b> and <b>1337</b> are used to transmit the antenna signals and are connected to contacts <b>105</b> and <b>106</b> respectively. The wide bands <b>1333</b> and <b>1334</b> are common to each other and are used to ground each of the antennas and are connected to the ground contact <b>1307</b> on the cap <b>1220</b>. The wide ground ribbons <b>1333</b> and <b>1334</b> shield the smaller antenna signal ribbons <b>1336</b> and <b>1337</b> and help to maintain the signal integrity.</p>
    <p>FIG. 47 is a diagram illustrating the use of portable data terminals according to the present invention which utilizes a plurality of radios to access different subnetworks of an overall communication network. Specifically, subnetworks <b>1403</b> and <b>1405</b> are illustrated which provide for an overall network environment for MCD <b>1401</b>. Each subnetwork <b>1403</b> and <b>1405</b> may have a host computer, such as <b>1407</b> and <b>1411</b>, and an access point, such as <b>1409</b> and <b>1413</b>. The access point <b>1409</b> provides for communication via one type of radio communication while access point <b>1403</b> provides for another. For examples, access point <b>1409</b> may provide a long-distance digital cellular link while access point <b>1413</b> provides for local spread spectrum link.</p>
    <p>In addition, access points <b>1409</b> and <b>1413</b> might also exist on a single network for providing multiple communication paths in case one access point fails or becomes overloaded.</p>
    <p>To accommodate multiple radios, the communication module of MCD <b>1401</b> contains multiple transceivers, and associated protocol substacks and antennas. Specifically, the communication module might include a single processing unit which handles multiple sets of software protocol substacks, i.e., one for each of the included transmitters. Similarly, if the protocol substacks and the processing unit functionality of each radio is too different, additional separate processing units may be included. Finally, the MCD (the portable data collection terminal) might also be designed to receive multiple communication modules.</p>
    <p>In addition, the base module may interrogate the selected (“inserted”) communication module(s) to determine which antennas to interconnect. Alternatively, the communication modules may interrogate the base module and request from the available antennas. Where a suitable antenna is not available, an external antenna connector is selected. Available antennas may be installed inside or on the outside of the base unit. Of course the antennas might also be selected via the physical communication module connectors as described below.</p>
    <p>FIG. 48 is a diagram illustrating an alternate configuration of portable data terminals according to the present invention. Specifically, a communication network <b>1450</b> provides an overall network environment for portable data collection terminals <b>1454</b>. A host computer <b>1451</b> is connected to access points <b>1452</b> via a wired connection <b>1453</b>. The access points <b>1452</b> are in turn communicatively coupled to portable data collection terminals <b>1454</b> via wireless links <b>1455</b>. The wireless links <b>1455</b> may be one or more of a plurality of wireless communications technologies, including narrowband radio frequency, spread spectrum radio frequency, infrared, and others.</p>
    <p>A dock <b>1456</b> and a portable data terminal <b>1458</b> according to the present invention may be connected to the wired backbone <b>1453</b>, and may serve a function similar to an access point <b>1452</b>. The dock <b>1456</b> may provide power to the terminal <b>1458</b>, or alternatively the dock may be absent and the terminal <b>1458</b> may run for a limited time under the power of its battery. The terminal <b>1458</b> connects directly to the wired backbone <b>1453</b>, and also communicates with another terminal <b>1454</b> through a wireless link <b>1455</b>. The terminal <b>1458</b> may, for example, be equipped with protocol converter circuitry to convert communication on the wire backbone <b>1453</b> into wireless communication on the link <b>1455</b>, and also to convert wireless communication on the link <b>1455</b> to a format for communication on the wire backbone <b>1453</b>. The communication module associated with terminal <b>1458</b> thus improves the versatility of the terminal <b>1458</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 49 illustrates one embodiment of the data collection terminal of the present invention, having both wired and wireless communication capability. A data terminal <b>1500</b> is shown having a communication module <b>1502</b> and a base module <b>1504</b>. The communication module <b>1502</b> contains a wired transceiver <b>1506</b>, a wireless transceiver <b>1508</b>, and processing and interface circuitry <b>1510</b>. The base module <b>1504</b> contains a control processor and interface <b>1512</b>, an application processor <b>1514</b>, and terminal circuitry <b>1516</b> containing data input and display portions and other circuitry well known in the art. The blocks shown in communication module <b>1502</b> and base module <b>1504</b> are simplified for exemplary purposes, and it will be understood by one skilled in the art that a data terminal <b>1500</b> according to the present invention is not limited to the block circuitry shown in FIG. <b>49</b>. In another embodiment, the communication module <b>1502</b> may contain additional transceivers for communicating on other mediums and in other networks. The processing and interface circuitry <b>1510</b> of the communication module <b>1502</b> isolates the circuitry of the base module <b>1504</b> from the differing operating characteristics of the transceivers, so that communication by any of the transceivers can be accommodated by the circuitry and software routines of the base module <b>1504</b>.</p>
    <p>In operation, the processing and interface circuitry <b>1510</b> of the communication module <b>1502</b> is programmed with the network configuration to route communication through either the wired transceiver <b>1506</b> or the wireless transceiver <b>1508</b>. An incoming message on the wired transceiver <b>1506</b> may be routed and processed to a terminal display portion, or may be routed to a host computer, a dock, or another portable data terminal <b>1500</b> through the wired transceiver <b>1506</b> or through the wireless transceiver <b>1508</b>, whichever is appropriate. Similarly, an incoming message on the wireless transceiver <b>1508</b> may be routed to display or through the wireless transceiver <b>1508</b> or through the wired transceiver <b>1506</b>, whichever is appropriate for the destination. By provided for the routing functions to be done in the communication module <b>1502</b>, the power used in the base module <b>1504</b> can be minimized. Specifically, the interface with the control processor <b>1512</b> and the application processor <b>1514</b> need not be used, which allows the main terminal in the base module <b>1504</b> to remain dormant while communications are routed in the communication module <b>1502</b>.</p>
    <p>The choice of which transceiver to use in routing communication is based on a “least cost” analysis, considering factors such as the power required to send the message through a particular transceiver, the speed at which the message will be received from a particular transceiver, the possibility of error associated with each transceiver, etc. A wired connection is usually selected when available, but routing decisions may vary with the different characteristics of each message and the mobility of the terminal. The processing and interface circuitry <b>1510</b> in the communication module <b>1502</b> is preferably capable of performing the least cost routing analysis for all communication messages, without activating any processing power from the base module <b>1504</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 50 is a diagram illustrating the use of portable terminals according to the present invention utilizing both wired and wireless communication in a network configuration. Specifically, a server <b>1515</b> is shown connected to mobile computing devices (MCDs) <b>1554</b> via a wired communication link <b>1552</b>. The communication link <b>1552</b> may alternatively be an infrared link, or another communication technology. MCDs <b>1554</b> are connected to each other and to the server via the link <b>1552</b>. MCDs <b>1554</b> are also communicatively coupled to each other via wireless links <b>1556</b>.</p>
    <p>The network involving the server <b>1550</b>, the communication link <b>1552</b>, and the MCDs <b>1554</b> represents a primary communication network, that is preferable to use when there are no interference or disconnection problems in the network. The network between MCDs <b>1554</b> involving wireless links <b>1556</b> represents an auxiliary or backup network, which is used where there are problems with the primary network, or to run diagnostics on the primary network. The MCDs <b>1554</b> are equipped to automatically switch from the primary network to the auxiliary network when a problem arises on the primary network. This network redundancy allows the MCDs <b>1554</b> to remain in constant communication with each other and with server <b>1550</b>.</p>
    <p>For example, a wired network on a communication link <b>1552</b> does not recognize connection well, and may not immediately detect a loss of connectivity. MCDs <b>1554</b> utilize wireless links <b>1556</b> to diagnose a lack of connection on the wired network <b>1552</b>. For example, an MCD <b>1554</b> may activate its radio to send a test message to another component of the network, either another MCD <b>1554</b> or the server <b>1550</b>, to test communication on the wired link <b>1552</b> by sending a reply test message back to the inquiring MCD <b>1554</b>. The test routine is preferably implemented and controlled by the processing/interface circuitry <b>1510</b> in the communication module <b>1502</b> (see FIG. 49) of the MCD <b>1554</b>. If the reply communication test is not received, the MCD <b>1554</b> will know that there is a problem on the primary network, and will inform other MCDs <b>1554</b> to switch to the auxiliary network. The MCDs <b>1554</b> can continue to check the primary network via wireless links <b>1556</b> until the primary network is back in service.</p>
    <p>Some MCDs <b>1554</b> may be out of range to effect wireless communication with server <b>1550</b> by a wireless link <b>1556</b>. An out-of-range condition is determined according to the particular communication and connection protocol implemented by MCDs <b>1554</b> and other network components such as server <b>1550</b>. In this situation, the out-of-range MCD <b>1554</b> sends its message, along with an out-of-range condition indicator, to another MCD <b>1554</b> that is in communication with the server <b>1550</b>, and the in-range MCD <b>1554</b> forwards the message on to the server. Similarly, the server <b>1550</b> sends its messages intended for the out-of-range MCD <b>1554</b> to an in-range MCD <b>1554</b> to be forwarded over a wireless link <b>1556</b>. The MCDs <b>1554</b> are capable of automatically switching from the wired network to the wireless network and vice versa for each communication attempt.</p>
    <p>FIG. 51 is a diagram illustrating the use of portable data terminals according to the present invention utilizing both wired and wireless communication to access separate subnetworks in an overall communication network. Specifically, a wired network includes wired server <b>1600</b> and mobile computing devices (MCDs) <b>1606</b> connected by a wired communication link <b>1604</b>. MCDs <b>1606</b> are also part of a wireless network with wireless server <b>1602</b>, and are communicatively coupled to each other and the wireless server <b>1602</b> via wireless communication links <b>1608</b>. Wireless links <b>1608</b> may be radio frequency communication links, such as narrowband, direct sequence spread spectrum, frequency hopping spread spectrum or other radio technologies. Alternatively, wireless links <b>1608</b> may be infrared communication links, or other wireless technologies. In another embodiment, the wired server <b>1600</b> and the wired communication links <b>1604</b> may utilize infrared communication technology, with the wireless communication links <b>1608</b> being radio frequency links. The present invention contemplates various combinations of communication technologies, all accommodated by communication modules of MCDs <b>1606</b>. The communication modules of MCDs <b>1606</b> include any number of transceivers operable on any number of communication mediums, since the differences in their operating characteristics are isolated from the base module of the MCDs <b>1606</b> by a communication processor. The MCDs <b>1606</b> are preferably able to automatically switch between the wired and wireless networks, controlled primarily by a communication processor in their communication modules.</p>
    <p>Some MCDs <b>1606</b> may be out of range to effect wireless communication with wireless server <b>1602</b> by a wireless link <b>1608</b>. An out-of-range condition is determined according to the particular communication and connection protocol implemented by MCDs <b>1606</b> and other network components such as wireless server <b>1602</b>. In this situation, the out-of-range MCD <b>1606</b> sends its message, along with an out-of-range condition indicator, to another MCD <b>1606</b> that is in communication with the wireless server <b>1602</b>, either over a wireless link <b>1608</b> or alternatively over a wired link <b>1604</b> if both MCDs <b>1606</b> are constituents of a wired network. The in-range MCD <b>1606</b> then forwards the message on to the wireless server <b>1602</b> over wireless link <b>1608</b>. Similarly, the wireless server <b>1602</b> sends its messages intended for the out-of-range MCD <b>1606</b> to an in-range MCD <b>1606</b> to be forwarded over a wireless link <b>1608</b> or a wired link <b>1604</b>, if both MCDs are constituents of a wired network.</p>
    <p>It should be realized that various other changes and modifications in the structure of the described embodiment would be possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the claims.</p>
