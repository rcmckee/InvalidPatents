<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
  <p num="p-0003">This invention relates to a hair dressing device equipped with hood, and more particularly a hair treatment device in which an operator can treat a subject's head from above, or which can shorten the time required for treatment, and a drain tank used in the hair treatment device.</p>
  <p num="p-0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
  <p num="p-0005">In a conventional hair dressing device, where two kinds of medicine solutions are used for the operation such as treatment, the operation was performed as follows. After a first medicine solution has been applied to a subject's hair, a hood is put on the subject's head to treat the hair. After a prescribed time elapses, the hood is taken off from the head. Further, a second medicine solution is applied to the subject's hair and the hood is put on the subject's head again. Where the operator makes the operation from just behind the subject, the operator shifts the hair dressing device sideways.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">Meanwhile, in order to treat the hair using the two kinds of medicine solutions in the above operation process, the hood must be once taken off. Therefore, in order to apply the second medicine solution, the position of the hood must be adjusted so that the head is centrally located at the hood. This adjustment is troublesome for both the operator and subject.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">Where the operator treats the subject's hair from just behind, the hair dressing device must be moved. This is troublesome. In addition, when the hair treatment device is moved, as the case may be, the device falls down and is damaged.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">This invention intends to solve the above problem, and hence a first object of this invention is to provide a hair dressing device which can improve the operability by carrying out an operation with the upper surface of a hood being opened when the solution to be applied is exchanged from a first solution into a second solution, and is not troublesome in the operation and can prevent damage owing to fall-down by carrying out the operation from real behind a subject without moving the device.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">Further, in the conventional hair dressing device equipped with a hood, treatment for the hair is carried out in the following manner. After a first medicine solution for treatment has been applied to the hair, with a subject's head being covered with a hood, water vapor is supplied into the hood to promote the hair. Upon completion of hair promotion, the supply of the water vapor is stopped. Thereafter, with the head being covered with the hood, the natural cooling of the hair is done. After the hair has been cooled in a degree, a second medicine solution for treatment is applied to the hair to carry out the same operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">Meanwhile, it takes a long time to do the above natural cooling of the hair after the hair treatment by water vapor has been done in the conventional hair dressing device. This prolongs the time taken until the second medicine solution is applied.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">This invention intends to solve such a problem, and hence the second object of this invention is to provide a hair dressing device equipped with a hood which can shorten a cooling time by blowing from a blower because water vapor supply from a water vapor generator and ventilation from the blower are performed for the hood, and hence shorten the time taken for hair treatment to shorten the time taken for the whole operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">Further, in a conventional hair dressing device equipped with a hood, water drops deposited on the inner wall of a hood are trapped into a drain tank from a water path formed in an opening of the hood through a flexible pipe. The one end of the flexible pipe is secured to the water path of the hood whereas the other end thereof is removably attached to the inlet of the drain tank.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">Meanwhile, when the atmospheric pressure in the hood increases to a prescribed value because of supply of water vapor into the hood, the water vapor as well as the water drops will invade the drain tank. In this case, since the water vapor contains the odor of a medicine solution applied to a subject's hair, the odor leaks from the drain tank and the water vapor leaks out from the inlet of the drain tank. Thus, water drops are deposited to an exterior component such as an exterior cover so that the exterior component may be damaged.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">Since the above flexible pipe is secured to the hood and drain tank, it is bent when the hood is opened/closed and hence may be damaged. Further, because of the presence of the flexible pipe, load is applied to an opening/closing movement of the hood.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">This invention intends to solve the above problem, and the third object of this invention is to provide a hair dressing device in which odor or water drops do not leak out from a drain tank, and a flexible pipe does not bend or load is not applied to an opening/closing movement of the hood in such a manner that the flexible pipe moves in the drain tank when the hood is opened/closed.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0016">In order to attain the first object of this invention, in accordance with the first aspect of this invention, there is provided a hair dressing device equipped with a hood comprising:</p>
  <p num="p-0017">a fixed hood and an opening/closing hood into which the hood is divided, the opening/closing hood being openably attached to the fixed hood,</p>
  <p num="p-0018">wherein the opening/closing hood is opened/closed so that the fixed hood is opened from above. Further, the opening/closing hood is opened at a rotating fulcrum of a front side thereof from a state where the opening/closing hood is put on a subject's head.</p>
  <p num="p-0019">As described above, the hood is divided into the fixed hood and the opening/closing hood. The opening/closing hood is opened/closed so that the fixed hood is opened from above. Therefore, even where the operation is done using two kinds of medicine solutions, the second medicine solution can be applied to the subject's hair by opening the opening/closing hood without moving the entire hood vertically. In addition, since the operation can be carried out from behind the subject, the operation can be done easily and in a reduced time.</p>
  <p num="p-0020">In a preferred embodiment, the opening/closing hood is urged in its opening direction by a spring at a rotating fulcrum, and is adapted lockable in a closed state at the side of the fixed hood.</p>
  <p num="p-0021">In this configuration, the subject will not be injured nor surprised owing to closing of the opening/closing hood during the operation. The opening/closing hood will not be inadvertently opened in the closed state. Thus, during the operation, the water vapor or cold wind will not leak externally.</p>
  <p num="p-0022">Further, in a preferred embodiment, the opening/closing hood is provided with a damper at the rotating fulcrum so that the opening/closing hood is gently rotated in its closing direction.</p>
  <p num="p-0023">In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the opening/closing hood is provided with a plurality of water vapor draining pores made at predetermined positions, and a flange which projects from an inner wall of each of the draining pores is formed integrally to or separately from each the draining pores to prevent water drops from flowing out from each the draining pores in a state where the opening/closing hood is opened.</p>
  <p num="p-0024">In this configuration, even when the opening/closing hood is opened after hair dressing, it is possible to prevent the water drops from soiling the cloth of the subject or floor.</p>
  <p num="p-0025">In a preferred embodiment, the fixed hood is vertically rotatably attached to a device body which incorporates a water vapor generator necessary for hair dressing, and when the fixed hood is opened beyond a prescribed angle from the device, the fixed hood is opened by urging force of rotating the fixed hood upward body, and when the fixed hood is closed to the prescribed angle or lower, weights of the opening/closing hood and the fixed hood overcome the urging force so that the fixed hood is closed.</p>
  <p num="p-0026">In this configuration, the hood can be fixed at at least an upright position or horizontal position without using any locking means, and when the hood is rotated toward the horizontal direction, the hood will not be rotated abruptly. Thus, the hood will not hit against the subject's head and the subject will not be surprised.</p>
  <p num="p-0027">In a preferred embodiment, the hair dressing device further comprises a face guard made of cloth or synthetic resin whose outer periphery is attached to the fixed hood at a position in the vicinity of an opening of the fixed hood and whose inner periphery is intimately attached to a circumference of a subject's head at a position where the subject's hair is located on the side of the opening/closing hood.</p>
  <p num="p-0028">In this configuration, since the face guard is attached to the subject's head to remove the gap between the subject's head and the opening of the fixed hood. Thus, the water vapor in the hood D will not touch the face of the subject so that the subject does not feel hot or unpleasant.</p>
  <p num="p-0029">In a preferred embodiment, the hair dressing device further comprises an elastic sealing ring attached to the inside of an outer periphery of either the fixed hood or the opening/closing hood to prevent water vapor from leaking from a boundary between the fixed hood and the opening/closing hood; and a locking member composed of a magnet and a magnetic substance located at the boundary so that the sealing member is in intimate contact with the fixed hood and the opening/closing hood in a state where the opening/closing hood is closed for the fixed hood.</p>
  <p num="p-0030">In this configuration, the water vapor will not leak externally from the hood and hence can be effectively employed for the operation.</p>
  <p num="p-0031">In order to attain the second object of this invention, there is provided a hair dressing device comprising:</p>
  <p num="p-0032">a hood to be put on a subject's head which is hair-dressed by water vapor supply;</p>
  <p num="p-0033">a water vapor generator for supplying water vapor into the hood through a first pipe; and</p>
  <p num="p-0034">a blower for supplying wind for cooling through a second pipe after the subject' head has been hair-dressed.</p>
  <p num="p-0035">In this configuration, after the hair has been dressed using the water vapor supplied from the water vapor generator into the hood, the hair is cooled using the wind supplied from the blower. This configuration shortens the cooling time after the hair dressing. Therefore, where the hair is dressed using two kinds of two medicine solutions, the time taken from application of the first medicine solution to that of the second medicine solution is shortened, and hence the time taken for hair treatment and for the whole operation can be shortened.</p>
  <p num="p-0036">In a preferred embodiment, the hair dressing device further comprises a cover attached to the second pipe, the cover closing while the wind is not supplied and swings to open because of wind pressure while the wind is supplied into the hood. Further, the first pipe and the second pipe are coupled to constitute a two-way pipe. While the water vapor is supplied into the hood from the water vapor generator, an inside of the second pipe is in a negative pressure state so that water vapor does not invade the blower.</p>
  <p num="p-0037">In these configurations, the water vapor will not invade the blower so that the failure of the blower due to rust or moisture can be prevented. In the case of the two-way pipe configuration, the wind supplied from the blower does not invade the water vapor generator so that the hot water in the water vapor generator is prevented from being cooled.</p>
  <p num="p-0038">In a preferred embodiment, the hair dressing device further comprises a diffusing plate attached to the hood at its water vapor and wind discharging positions, respectively, the diffusing plates diffusing the water vapor and wind supplied from the water vapor generator and blower into the hood.</p>
  <p num="p-0039">In this configuration, the entire hair is uniformly sprayed with the water vapor and wind and hence can be effectively dressed.</p>
  <p num="p-0040">In a preferred embodiment, a water path is formed in an opening of the hood to receive water drops from an inner periphery of hood, the water path has a hole made at the lowest position when the hood is opened, and a drain tank is removably attached to the hole.</p>
  <p num="p-0041">In this configuration, the water drops deposited on the inner wall of the hood are trapped in the drain tank via the water path in the opening of the hood. Therefore, the clothes of the subject or floor will not be soiled owing to the water drops. In addition, since the drain tank can be detached, the water drops can be easily disposed.</p>
  <p num="p-0042">In a preferred embodiment, the hair dressing device comprises</p>
  <p num="p-0043">a hood to be put on a subject's head which is hair-dressed by water vapor supply, the hood being attached to a device body post;</p>
  <p num="p-0044">a water vapor generator incorporated in the device body post for supplying water vapor into the hood,</p>
  <p num="p-0045">an operating portion for controlling the water vapor generator, formed on the upper surface of the device body post, the operating portion being located at a rearward position on a center line of the hood and rearward aslant.</p>
  <p num="p-0046">In such a configuration, various settings by the operating portion can be made easily and effectively by the operator.</p>
  <p num="p-0047">In a preferred embodiment, the hair dressing device comprises</p>
  <p num="p-0048">a hood to be put on a subject's head which is hair-dressed by water vapor supply, the hood being attached to a device body post;</p>
  <p num="p-0049">a water vapor generator incorporated in the device body post for supplying water vapor into the hood; and</p>
  <p num="p-0050">a water supply tank for supplying water to the water vapor generator, which is attached to the device body post and adapted to be detachable aslant behind the device body post.</p>
  <p num="p-0051">In this configuration, the water supply into the water vapor generator can be easily done.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">In a preferred embodiment, the hair dressing device comprises</p>
  <p num="p-0053">a hood to be put on a subject's head which is hair-dressed by water vapor supply, the hood being attached to a device body post;</p>
  <p num="p-0054">a water vapor generator incorporated in the device body post for supplying water vapor into the hood;</p>
  <p num="p-0055">a water supply tank for supplying water to the water vapor generator, which is attached to the device body post;</p>
  <p num="p-0056">a drain valve for draining remaining water from the bottom of the water supply tank; and</p>
  <p num="p-0057">a drain cup located below the drain valve, which is detachable from the device body post.</p>
  <p num="p-0058">In this configuration, where the water in the water supply tank has become unnecessary, the drain valve is opened and the water can be transferred into the drain cup which is detachable from the device body post. Therefore, when the operator is free, the drain cup is removed from the device body post so that the water in the drain cup can be drain easily and at any optional time.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">In order to attain the third object of this invention, in accordance with this invention, there is provided a hair dressing device comprising:</p>
  <p num="p-0060">a hood to be put on a subject's head which is hair-dressed by water vapor supply, the hood being attached to a device body post;</p>
  <p num="p-0061">a water path formed by folding back the inner periphery of the hood;</p>
  <p num="p-0062">a flexible pipe with the one end attached to the outlet of the water path; and</p>
  <p num="p-0063">a drain tank into which the other end of the flexible pipe can be inserted, wherein</p>
  <p num="p-0064">the drain tank comprises:</p>

  <p num="p-0099">Now referring to the drawings, an explanation will be given of an embodiment of a hair dressing device equipped with a hood according to the first aspect of this invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0100"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an entire structure of the hair dressing device equipped with a hood according to this invention.</p>
  <p num="p-0101">As seen from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the hair dressing device includes a base plate A equipped with a caster, a supporting post B fixed to the base plate A, a device body C attached to the supporting post B, a hood D which is attached to the upper portion of the device body so that the hood is vertically rotatable and fixable and a neck receiver E. The device body C incorporates a vertical movement mechanism, a water tank, a water vapor generator for water vaporizing the water stored in the water tank, a blower, a drain cup for receiving the water drained from a water supply tank, a drain receiver for receiving the hot water built up in the hood D, and is provided with an operating portion for setting the driving times of the water vapor generator and blower. The device body is entirely covered with a cover. The neck receiver E is brought into contact with the back of the neck of the subject sitting in a chair to position the subject's head relatively to the hood D.</p>
  <p num="p-0102">Now referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, an explanation will be given of the concrete configuration of the device body C.</p>
  <p num="p-0103">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a first embodiment of a vertical movement mechanism will be explained. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, reference numeral <b>11</b> denotes a base plate to which the above hood D and the neck receiver E are attached. Reference numeral <b>12</b> denotes a shaft rod which dangles downward from the back of the base plate. The lower end of the shaft rod <b>12</b> is in contact with the upper end of an elastic member <b>13</b> such as a spring inserted in the supporting post B so that the base plate <b>11</b> is always upward urged by spring force.</p>
  <p num="p-0104">A vertical movement tube <b>14</b> is attached to the back of the base plate <b>11</b> to be slidable relatively to the supporting post B. A rotary shaft <b>15</b> which is rotatably attached to the base plate <b>11</b> is provided with a handle <b>16</b> at the tip. The rotary shaft <b>15</b> is also provided with a brake presser <b>17</b> which is </p> <div class="patent-image small-patent-image"> <a href="//patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/US7028348B2/US07028348-20060418-P00001.png"> <img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001" he="2.79mm" wi="2.46mm" file="US07028348-20060418-P00001.TIF" alt="Figure US07028348-20060418-P00001" img-content="character" img-format="tif" src="//patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/US7028348B2/US07028348-20060418-P00001.png" class="patent-full-image" width="9" height="11"> </a> </div>-shaped in the free section relative to the vertical movement tube <b>14</b>. Therefore, as the handle <b>16</b> is revolved, the brake presser <b>17</b> moves vertically relatively to the vertical movement tube <b>14</b>.
  <p num="p-0105">The brake presser <b>17</b> has a convex face <b>17</b> <i>a </i>formed in the longitudinal direction at the lower end so as to close toward the vertical movement tube <b>14</b>. A brake <b>19</b> is attached to the vertical movement tube <b>14</b> so that the brake <b>19</b> is movable in a direction perpendicular to the vertical movement tube <b>14</b> and is provided with a brake pad <b>19</b> <i>a </i>in slidable contact with the supporting rod B. The brake presser <b>17</b> is only vertically movable relatively to the vertical movement tube <b>14</b> through the brake <b>19</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0106">In the vertical movement mechanism <b>1</b> having the configuration described above, as seen from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when the handle <b>16</b> is made horizontal so that the brake <b>19</b> moves to the supporting post B by the convex face <b>17</b> <i>a </i>of the brake presser <b>17</b>, the break pad <b>19</b> <i>a </i>is brought into press-contact with the supporting post B. Thus, the vertical movement tube <b>14</b> is fixed to the supporting post B against the spring force.</p>
  <p num="p-0107">The base plate <b>11</b> is raised as follows. When the handle <b>16</b> is revolved by about 90° from the state of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the brake presser <b>17</b> rises relatively to the vertical movement tube <b>14</b>. Then, the convex face <b>17</b> <i>a </i>of the brake presser <b>17</b> leaves the brake <b>19</b> so that the press-contact force between the brake pad <b>19</b> <i>a </i>and the supporting post B is released, thereby allowing the vertical tube <b>14</b> to be in a free state.</p>
  <p num="p-0108">In this state, since the spring force by the elastic member <b>13</b> is upwards exerted to the vertical movement tube <b>14</b>, the vertical movement tube <b>14</b> can be easily raised. The vertical movement tube <b>14</b> can be lowered against the spring force of the elastic member <b>13</b>. By rotating the handle <b>16</b> to the previous position at a desired raised position or lowered position, the brake pad <b>19</b> <i>a </i>is brought into press-contact with the supporting post so that the brake pad <b>19</b> <i>a </i>can be fixed to the supporting post B at that position.</p>
  <p num="p-0109">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, another vertical movement mechanism <b>2</b> will be explained below. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, like reference numerals refer to like elements in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0110">In this embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in order to fix the vertical movement tube <b>14</b> to the supporting post B by the brake <b>19</b>, the brake pad <b>19</b> <i>a </i>is brought into press-contact with the supporting post B by the convex face <b>17</b> <i>a </i>of the brake presser <b>17</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0111">On the other hand, in this embodiment, a conical brake presser <b>22</b> is attached to a vertical movement axial rod <b>21</b> which is moved vertically through a link <b>18</b> by rotating a handle <b>16</b>; the brake pad <b>19</b> <i>a </i>of the brake <b>19</b> is brought into press-contact with the supporting post B by a large diameter portion <b>22</b> <i>a </i>of the conical brake presser <b>22</b>; and when a small diameter portion <b>22</b> <i>b </i>is located at the brake <b>19</b>, the above press-contact force is released. Incidentally, reference numeral <b>23</b> denotes an attaching piece for attaching the brake <b>19</b> to the vertical movement tube <b>14</b>. The vertical movement tube <b>14</b> is guided by the attaching piece <b>23</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0112">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the water vapor generator <b>3</b> of the device body C will be explained.</p>
  <p num="p-0113">The case of the device body C incorporates the water vapor generator <b>3</b> fixed to the vertical movement tube <b>14</b>. The water vapor generated by the water vapor generator <b>3</b> is derived into the hood D through a flexible pipe <b>31</b>. The water vapor generator <b>3</b> is provided with a water supply tank <b>32</b> at the lower part. The water supply tank <b>32</b> is adapted to be detachable from obliquely above. The water supply tank <b>32</b> is designed as a part of the case in a state where the water supply tank <b>32</b> is housed in the case. The water supply tank <b>32</b> is designed so that when it is installed in a tank receiver, its lower part is opened, and the water in the water supply tank <b>32</b> is exhausted by opening an exhaust valve <b>33</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0114">Below the drain valve <b>33</b>, a drain cup <b>34</b> which is detachable from the case is located. Upon completion of the operation, by opening the exhaust valve <b>33</b>, the water contained in the water supply tank <b>32</b> is drained into the drain cup <b>34</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0115">The case of the device body <b>3</b> incorporates a blower <b>4</b> composed of a motor and fan attached to the vertical movement tube <b>14</b>. The cold wind supplied from the blower <b>4</b> is derived into the hood D through a flexible pipe <b>41</b> vertically in parallel to the flexible pipe <b>31</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0116">The case of the device body C incorporates a drain tank <b>5</b> for trapping the water supplied from a water path <b>71</b> <i>b</i>, which is formed by folding back the inner periphery of the hood in order to exhaust the water changed in the hood from the water vapor. The drain tank <b>5</b> is attached to the vertical movement tube <b>14</b> in such a manner that it can be detached by being screwed into the tip of a pipe <b>51</b> coupled with the water path <b>71</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0117">An operating portion <b>6</b> is attached to the upper face of the case of the device body C. The operating portion <b>6</b> is inclined backward so that it can be easily operated. The operating portion <b>6</b> is provided with a control circuit for automatically controlling the ON/OFF and generating time of the water vapor generator <b>3</b>, driving time of the blower <b>4</b> and switching from the water vapor generator <b>3</b> which has been turned off into the blower <b>4</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0118">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 7</figref>, the structure of the hood D will be explained. The hood D includes a fixed hood <b>71</b> and an opening/closing hood <b>72</b> supported to the front of the fixed hood <b>71</b>. The base end <b>71</b> <i>a </i>of the fixed hood <b>71</b> is rotatably supported to a pair of plates <b>73</b> upright attached to the base plate <b>1</b> which is vertically movable so that it can be locked between two positions of a horizontal state (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and an upright state (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
  <p num="p-0119">The fixed hood <b>71</b> is provided, at its opening, with a folded-back water path <b>71</b> <i>b </i>on the entire inner periphery. The water path <b>71</b> <i>b </i>has a hole which communicates with the pipe <b>51</b> at the lowest position. The water trapped in the water path <b>71</b> <i>b </i>is trapped in the drain tank <b>5</b> through a pipe <b>51</b> from the hole.</p>
  <p num="p-0120">The opened tips of the flexible pipes <b>31</b> and <b>41</b> are attached to the side of the upright plates <b>73</b> of the fixed hood <b>71</b>. A diffusing plate <b>71</b> <i>c </i>is attached to the inner periphery of the fixed hood <b>71</b> at the position correspond to the flexible pipes <b>31</b> and <b>41</b>. The diffusing plate <b>71</b> <i>c </i>serves to spray the water vapor and cold wind to the head from the entire periphery without directly spraying them to the rear of a subject's head.</p>
  <p num="p-0121">The entire opening/closing hood <b>72</b> is designed in a double structure to provide a thermal insulation effect. The opening/closing hood <b>72</b> is openably supported by a shaft <b>72</b> <i>a </i>at the tip of the fixed hood <b>71</b>, and spring-urged by a helical spring <b>72</b> <i>b </i>in a direction of closing the opening/closing hood <b>72</b>. The opening/closing hood <b>72</b> is formed to be locked at the base end of the fixed hood <b>71</b>. Incidentally, a locking mechanism may be adapted so that a magnet is attached to the fixed hood <b>71</b> and a magnetic material is attached to the opening/closing hood <b>72</b>. The locking mechanism may be a known locking mechanism which can perform locking/unlocking.</p>
  <p num="p-0122">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, an explanation will be given of the neck receiver E.</p>
  <p num="p-0123">The neck receiver E includes an arm <b>81</b> whose stem is secured to the upright plate <b>73</b> and a neck contact <b>82</b> secured to the tip of the arm <b>81</b>. When the hood D is put on a subject's head with the neck contact being in contact with the back of the neck of the subject, the subject's head is located at the center of the hood D. The neck contact is formed in a cylindrical shape and made of an elastic material which permits the neck contact to be used as a pillow pad.</p>
  <p num="p-0124">An explanation will be given of the operation of dressing the subject's hair on the basis of the configuration described above.</p>
  <p num="p-0125">First, in a state where the hood D has been rotated upward, the subject with a first medicine solution for e.g. treatment being applied on the hair is caused to sit on a chair. Next, the handle <b>16</b> is rotated to lower the brake presser <b>17</b> or conical brake presser <b>21</b> so that the height of the device body C is adjusted with the brake pad <b>19</b> <i>a </i>of the brake <b>19</b> being separated from the supporting post B. Thus, the position of the subject's head is adjusted so that the neck contact <b>82</b> of the neck receiver E is located at the back of the neck of the subject. Thereafter, the handle <b>16</b> is rotated to the initial position so that the brake pad <b>19</b> <i>a </i>is brought into press-contact with the supporting post B, thereby securing the device body C to the supporting post B.</p>
  <p num="p-0126">In this state, with the hood D being put on the subject's head, the operating portion <b>6</b> is operated to set the time suitable for the above applied medicine solution and the subsequent operating time of the blower. Thus, the water vapor generated from the water vapor generator <b>3</b> is supplied into the hood D through the flexible pipe <b>31</b>. By the diffusing plate <b>71</b> <i>c </i>attached to the fixed hood <b>71</b>, the water vapor is sprayed over the entire interior of the hood D so that moisture is given to the hair, thereby dressing the hair.</p>
  <p num="p-0127">When the operation of the water vapor generator <b>3</b> is ended, the blower <b>4</b> is subsequently operated so that cold wind is supplied into the hood D through the flexible pipe <b>41</b>. Like the above case, by the diffusing plate <b>71</b> <i>c</i>, the cold wind is sprayed on the hair from the entire interior of the hood D to dry the hair.</p>
  <p num="p-0128">Upon completion of the hair dressing by the first medicine solution, the locking between the opening/closing hood <b>72</b> and the fixed hood <b>71</b> is released. The opening/closing hood <b>72</b> is opened forward so that the back of the subject is seen from the operator who stands behind. Incidentally, when the opening/closing hood <b>72</b> is once opened, the opened state of the opening/closing hood <b>72</b> is maintained by spring force.</p>
  <p num="p-0129">After a second medicine solution has been applied to the subject's hair, the opening/closing hood <b>72</b> is closed and locked. The operating portion is operated again to set the water vapor generating time and cold wind generating time, thereby dressing the hair. Upon completion of the hair dressing, the handle <b>16</b> is rotated to separate the brake pad <b>19</b> <i>a </i>from the supporting post B and raise the device body C. The subject is caused to leave the chair. Thus, the entire operation of the hair dressing is ended.</p>
  <p num="p-0130">Incidentally, in the embodiment described above, the opening/closing hood <b>72</b> has been opened/closed vertically at the forward position of the fixed hood <b>71</b>. However, the opening/closing hood <b>72</b> may be opened/closed horizontally, otherwise, the two halves into which the opening/closing hood <b>72</b> is divided may be slid horizontally, respectively so that the subject's head is seen from behind.</p>
  <p num="p-0131">Meanwhile, since the interior of the hood D is placed in a pressurized state by the supplied water vapor, generally, the hood has a water vapor draining pore for slightly draining the water vapor. Where a water vapor draining pore <b>72</b> <i>c </i>is provided in this invention also, since the opening/closing hood <b>72</b> is opened upward upon completion of the hair dressing, the water drops put on the inner wall of the opening/closing hood <b>72</b> leak externally. As a result, the clothes of the subject or floor may be soiled.</p>
  <p num="p-0132">In accordance with this invention, as seen from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, on the rear side of the water vapor draining pore <b>72</b> <i>c</i>, a flange <b>72</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> is made along the periphery of the water vapor draining pore <b>72</b> <i>c</i>, or otherwise, as seen from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a ring <b>72</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> of synthetic resin is fit in the water vapor draining pore <b>72</b> <i>c </i>to form the flange. In this case, even when the water drops flow in the direction of the water vapor draining pore <b>72</b> <i>c </i>as a result that the opening/closing hood <b>72</b> is opened, the water drops are interrupted by the flange <b>72</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> or <b>72</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> and do not flow externally. Thus, the cloths of the subject or floor will not be soiled.</p>
  <p num="p-0133">The rotating mechanism for rotating the base end <b>71</b> <i>a </i>of the fixed hood <b>71</b> employed in the embodiment is rotatably supported to the upright plate <b>73</b> on the base plate <b>1</b> and can lock the hood D in an upright state and a horizontal state. However, where the hood D is rotated from the locked upright state or the horizontal state, the hood D is placed in a free state. Therefore, the hood D may be rotated horizontally because of its own weight and hence may hit against the subject's head.</p>
  <p num="p-0134">In order to obviate such inconvenience, in accordance with this invention, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a ring-shaped space <b>71</b> <i>a</i> <b>2</b>, which has a protrusion <b>71</b> <i>a</i> <b>1</b> at the center on both sides of the base end <b>71</b> <i>a </i>in the fixed hood <b>71</b>, is formed. A helical spring <b>74</b> is fit over the protrusion <b>71</b> <i>a</i> <b>1</b> so that the helical spring <b>74</b> is accommodated within the space <b>71</b> <i>a</i> <b>2</b>. The one end of the helical spring <b>74</b> is secured to the base end <b>71</b> <i>a </i>whereas the other end thereof is secured to the upright plate <b>73</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0135">Although not shown, the base end <b>71</b> <i>a </i>and the upright plate <b>73</b> are rotatably supported. The locking means at the above two positions are also not shown. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the spring generating moment of the helical spring <b>74</b> is larger than the hood moment (moment by the weight of the hood D) at a prescribed position until which the hood D changes toward the horizontal direction, and when the hood D passes the prescribed position, the hood moment gradually becomes larger than the spring generating moment.</p>
  <p num="p-0136">In accordance with such a configuration, since in the upright state of the hood D, the spring generating moment is larger than the hood moment in their torque, the hood D is maintained in the upright state. When the operator pushes the hood D toward the horizontal direction from the upright position, the hood is urged to return to the upright position since the spring generating moment is larger than the hood moment until the crossing point of the spring generating moment and the hood moment. At the position corresponding to the crossing point, the hood D is held at this position. When the operator further tilts the hood D toward the horizontal direction, since the hood moment gradually becomes larger than the spring generating moment, the hood D is gradually shifted and eventually rotated to the horizontal position which is an operation position. Incidentally, a damping means by hydraulic pressure may be adopted in place of the helical spring <b>74</b> as long as it has the characteristic as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0137">Thus, in the upright state, the hood D is maintained at the upright position by the spring force by the helical spring <b>74</b>. The hood D is rotated until the prescribed position on the way of rotation toward the horizontal direction by only the force applied by the operator. When the hood D passes the prescribed position, the hood D is gradually rotated to the horizontal position owing to the weight of the hood D against the spring force. The hood D is eventually stopped at the operating position. Thus, the hood D can be fixed at the upright position and the horizontal position without using the locking means. In addition, while the hood D is rotated toward the horizontal direction, the hood D is not abruptly rotated so that the hood D does not hit against the subject nor surprise the subject.</p>
  <p num="p-0138"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows an improved rotating mechanism for the fixed hood <b>71</b> and opening/closing hood <b>72</b>. In the embodiment described above, the opening/closing hood <b>72</b> is urged using only the helical spring <b>72</b> <i>b </i>in a direction in which the opening/closing hood <b>72</b> is closed. However, in this embodiment, the helical spring <b>72</b> <i>b </i>and a damper <b>72</b> <i>d </i>by hydraulic pressure are combined with each other so that the opening/closing hood can be opened/closed gently and smoothly for the fixed hood <b>71</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0139">In a still another embodiment, only the damper <b>72</b> <i>d </i>is placed between the opening/closing hood <b>72</b> and a shaft for supporting the opening/closing hood <b>72</b> and the fixed hood <b>71</b> so that when the opening/closing hood <b>72</b> is closed, it is gently closed by the function of the damper <b>72</b> <i>d</i>, whereas when the opening/closing hood <b>72</b> is opened, it is pushed up by the operator.</p>
  <p num="p-0140">In the embodiments described above, when the subject putting on the hood D is supplied with the water vapor, the water vapor trapped in the hood D is discharged downward from the opening of the water path <b>71</b> <i>b </i>of the fixed hood <b>71</b>. The water vapor thus discharged hits against the face of the subject so that the subject feels hot and unpleasant.</p>
  <p num="p-0141">In order to obviate such inconvenience, in accordance with this invention, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, a ring-shaped supporting plate <b>75</b> is attached to the upper side of the water path <b>71</b> <i>b</i>. The ring-shaped supporting plate <b>75</b> serves to anchor the outer periphery of a ring-shaped face guard <b>9</b> which will be described later. The face guard <b>9</b> is made of cloth or film of synthetic resin. The face guard <b>9</b> is wide ring-shaped. The face guard <b>9</b> has a tightening tool <b>91</b> such as a string or wire for tightening the face guard attached along the supporting plate <b>75</b> on the outer periphery and another tightening tool <b>92</b> for tightening the face guard attached in intimate contact with the subject's head on the inner periphery. The tightening tools <b>91</b> and <b>92</b> each may be provided with a fastener for preventing the string or wire in the tightened state from being loosed.</p>
  <p num="p-0142">With the outer periphery of the face guard <b>9</b> previously anchored to the supporting plate <b>75</b> of the fixed hood <b>71</b> using the tightening tool <b>91</b> and the hood D put on the subject, the opening/closing hood <b>72</b> is opened and the inner periphery of the face guard is fit over the subject's head and the subject's hair is dressed so that the hair of the subject is located at the upper side of the face guard <b>9</b>. Thereafter, the tightening tool <b>92</b> is tightened so that the face guard <b>9</b> is anchored to the subject's head. The tightened state will not be loosed by the fastener.</p>
  <p num="p-0143">In this way, the face guard <b>9</b> is attached to the subject's head to remove the gap between the subject's head and the opening of the fixed hood <b>71</b>. Thus, the water vapor in the hood D will not touch the face of the subject so that the subject does not feel hot or unpleasant.</p>
  <p num="p-0144">In the embodiments described above, the entire hood D is made of synthetic resin so that a gap is generated in the contact plane between the fixed hood <b>71</b> and the opening/closing hood <b>72</b> and the water vapor may leak externally. In order to obviate such inconvenience, in accordance with this invention, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a sealing ring <b>10</b>, which is composed of a hollow semi-sphere <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and a hollow rectangular parallelepiped <b>10</b> <i>b</i>, is fit on the side of the parallelepiped <b>10</b> <i>b </i>in a ring-shaped groove <b>71</b> <i>f </i>which is formed on the plane of the fixed hood <b>71</b> which abuts on the opening/closing hood <b>72</b> so that the semi-sphere <b>10</b> <i>a </i>is in contact with the lower surface of the opening/closing hood <b>10</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
  <p num="p-0145">Incidentally, reference numeral <b>101</b> denotes an adsorption means composed of a plurality of magnetic substances and magnets which are attached to the fixed hood <b>71</b> on the plane abutting on the opening/closing hood <b>72</b>. Reference numeral <b>102</b> denotes a magnetic substance attached to the adsorption means <b>101</b> at a position opposite to the adsorption means <b>101</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0146">Since the sealing ring <b>10</b> is attached to the fixed hood <b>71</b>, when the opening/closing is closed, it is brought into intimate contact with the semi-sphere <b>10</b> <i>a </i>in a crushed state as shown by a phantom line. Therefore, the water vapor will not leak externally from the hood D. In this state, since the magnet is adsorbed to the adsorption means <b>101</b> including the magnet, the intimate contact state between the fixed hood <b>71</b> and the opening/closing hood <b>72</b> is maintained.</p>
  <p num="p-0147">Additionally, in the embodiment described above, the sealing ring <b>10</b> and the adsorption means <b>101</b> are attached to the fixed hood <b>71</b>, but may be attached to the opening/closing hood <b>72</b>. In this case, it is of course that the magnetic substance <b>102</b> is attached to the fixed hood <b>71</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0148">Aspect II</p>
  <p num="p-0149">In the hair dressing device explained with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 7</figref>, after the hair has been dressed by the water vapor, the drying of the hair is promoted the air blow by the blower <b>4</b>. However, when the water vapor is supplied into the hood D through the flexible pipe <b>31</b>, the water vapor may invade the flexible pipe <b>41</b> connected to the blower <b>4</b> so that the flexible pipe <b>41</b> rusts.</p>
  <p num="p-0150">In order to obviate such inconvenience, in accordance with this invention, the water vapor generator having such a configuration as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 to 20</figref> is provided. Incidentally, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows an example of the water vapor generator <b>3</b>. As seen from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the water vapor generator <b>3</b> is arranged below the water supply tank <b>32</b>, and the water drops form the water supply tank <b>32</b> are supplied into a vessel <b>35</b> of the water vapor generator <b>3</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0151">An ultrasonic oscillator <b>35</b> <i>a </i>and heater <b>35</b> <i>b </i>are attached to the back of the vessel <b>35</b>. The water drops are trapped in the vessel <b>35</b> and fall into a mist state by the ultrasonic oscillator <b>35</b> <i>a</i>. Water vapor is generated by the heater <b>35</b> <i>b</i>. By a fan <b>36</b>, the mist and water vapor are transferred into the flexible pipe <b>31</b> in a high pressure state through a blower tube <b>37</b> and into the hood D. The water vapor discharged from the tip of the flexible pipe <b>31</b>, which is in the high pressure state, will invade the flexible pipe <b>41</b> on the side of the blower <b>4</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0152">As seen from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>, a cover <b>42</b> is attached to a tip <b>41</b> <i>a </i>of an opening of the flexible pipe <b>41</b>, which extends into the hood D, so that the cover <b>42</b> is swingably pivoted on the upper end of the opening tip <b>41</b> <i>a</i>. The cover <b>42</b> serves to close the opening in a closed state. The cover <b>42</b> swings to open the opening tip <b>41</b> <i>a </i>according to a wind pressure from the blower <b>4</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0153">Thus, in the state where water vapor is being supplied into the hood D, the cover <b>42</b> is closing the opening tip <b>41</b> <i>a </i>owing to its own weight and the pressure of supplying the water vapor into the hood D. This prevents the blower from rusting owing to the water vapor. Further, when the generation of the water vapor is stopped and the air blow from the air blower is done, the cover swings upwards by the wind pressure so that the opening tip <b>41</b> <i>a </i>is opened. Thus, the hair is dried by the wind from the blower <b>4</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0154"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref> show another embodiment of a device for preventing invasion of water vapor in a blower. This embodiment is provided with a two-way pipe <b>43</b>. The separating side thereof outside the hood D is connected to the flexible pipe <b>31</b> connected to the water vapor generator <b>3</b> and the flexible pipe <b>41</b> connected to the blower <b>4</b>. The common side thereof is connected to the inlet side of the hood D. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>, like reference numerals refer to like elements in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0155">In such a configuration, the water vapor generated from the water vapor generator <b>3</b> is supplied into the hood D through the flexible pipe <b>31</b> and the two-way pipe <b>43</b>. In this case, when the water vapor passes through the two-way pipe <b>43</b>, the inside of the flexible pipe <b>41</b> falls into a negative pressure state according to the flowing speed of the water vapor so that air is pulled from the side of the blower <b>4</b> to the flowing side of the water vapor. Thus, the water vapor will not invade the blower <b>4</b> so that the blower will not rust owing to the water vapor.</p>
  <p num="p-0156">Where the blower <b>4</b> is being driven to make wind for drying while the generation of water vapor is stopped, the wind from the blower <b>4</b> will not invade the water vapor generator <b>3</b> by the same function as described above so that the hot water stored in the vessel <b>35</b> is not cooled.</p>
  <p num="p-0157">Aspect III</p>
  <p num="p-0158">In accordance with this invention, there is provided a hair dressing device equipped with an improved drain tank.</p>
  <p num="p-0159">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 24</figref>, reference numeral <b>201</b> denotes a hood, and <b>202</b> denotes a device body to which the hood <b>201</b> is attached so that the hood <b>201</b> can be opened/closed at a closed state (operated state) (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>) and opened state (non-operated state) (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>). The device body <b>202</b> includes a water vapor generator <b>221</b>, a tank <b>222</b> and an operating panel <b>223</b>. Reference numeral <b>224</b> denotes a caster and reference numeral <b>225</b> denotes a neck receiver which is kept in contact with a subject's neck to fix the position of a subject's head.</p>
  <p num="p-0160"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> shows a partially sectional view of the hood <b>201</b>. As seen from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, a water path <b>211</b> is formed on the inner periphery of the hood <b>201</b>. The water path <b>211</b> serves to receive the water drops which are deposited on and flow along the inner wall of the hood. The outlet <b>211</b> <i>a </i>of the water path <b>211</b> is fixedly connected to one end of a flexible pipe <b>203</b>. The other end of the flexible pipe <b>203</b> is slidably inserted into the inlet <b>241</b> of a drain tank <b>204</b> which is removably attached to an outer wall of the device body <b>202</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0161">Now referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 25</figref>, a detailed explanation will be given of the structure of the drain tank <b>204</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0162">The drain tank <b>204</b> is a hollow rectangular body made of synthetic resin. The drain tank <b>204</b> is provided with the above inlet <b>241</b> at the upper position and holes <b>242</b> which are employed to attach the drain tank <b>204</b> to the outer wall of the device body <b>202</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0163">At the upper position within the drain tank <b>204</b>, a pair of guide portions <b>243</b> are formed at the positions the distance between which is larger than the diameter of the flexible pipe <b>203</b>. Below the guide portions <b>243</b>, a first trapping portion <b>245</b> formed by a U-shape partition wall <b>244</b>. The U-shape partition wall <b>244</b> is extended to form the hole <b>242</b>. A space below the first trapping portion <b>45</b> constitutes a second trapping portion <b>246</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0164">An explanation will be given of the operation of the drain tank <b>204</b>. In the state where the hood <b>201</b> is put on a subject's head as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the flexible pipe <b>203</b> is pushed out downwards to be inserted into the drain tank <b>204</b> so that the lower end of the flexible pipe <b>203</b> reach the lower end of the first trapping portion <b>245</b> of the drain tank <b>204</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0165">In this state, when the water drops flow out from the outlet <b>211</b> <i>a </i>through the water path <b>211</b> as a result that the water vapor is supplied into the hood <b>201</b>, the water drops flow into the first trapping portion <b>245</b> and the lower end of the flexible pipe <b>203</b> sinks in the water trapped in the first trapping portion <b>245</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0166">In this state, when the atmospheric pressure within the hood <b>203</b> increases to a prescribed level owing to supply of the water vapor into the hood, the water vapor containing the odor of the medicine solution applied to the hair of the subject as well as the water drops enter the drain tank <b>204</b>. In this case, since the odor as well as the water vapor is supplied into the trapped water, the odor will not leak out externally.</p>
  <p num="p-0167">Therefore, there does not occur a situation where the water drops leak out externally and the water drops are put on the exterior component such as an exterior cover so that the exterior component is soiled. The unpleasant feeling due to the odor is not also given to persons around the hair dressing device. Upon completion of the hair dressing, the hood <b>201</b> is rotated counterclockwise as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> so that the hood <b>201</b> leaves the subject's head. In this case, the flexible pipe <b>203</b> is pulled out upwards while it is guided by a guiding portion <b>243</b>. In both cases where the hood <b>201</b> is changed from the closed state into the opened state and vice versa, the flexible pipe <b>203</b> will not be bent and deterioration of the flexible pipe <b>203</b> can be prevented.</p>
  <p num="p-0168">When the first trapping portion <b>245</b> is filled with the water, the water overflows from the upper end of a partition wall <b>244</b> to flow into the second trapping portion <b>246</b>. When the second trapping portion <b>246</b> is also filled with water, the flexible pipe <b>203</b> is pulled out from the inlet <b>241</b>. By removing the holes <b>242</b> from the exterior wall of the device body, the whole water within the drain tank <b>204</b> can be drained.</p>
