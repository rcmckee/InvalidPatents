The remote portion of the split personal computer system is located in a remote location and normally maintained by a network service provider. The local portion includes a television display unit, and a television accessory unit in communication with the television display unit. An input unit is located adjacent the television display unit and is in communication with the television accessory unit to input data signals into the television accessory unit. Finally, communication means are provided for interfacing the television accessory unit of the local portion to the remote portion for permitting data signals received by the television accessory unit from the input unit to be transmittable from the television accessory unit to the remote portion of the split personal computer system. The data signals are processable by the remote portion to generate output signals. The output signals include video signals and are transmittable from the remote portion to the television accessory unit.

The local portion of the split personal computer system is located in conjunction with the TV system located at homes or hotels. The remote portion of the split personal computer system is located in a remote location and normally maintained by a network service provider. The local portion includes a television display unit, and a television accessory unit in communication with the television display unit. An input unit is located adjacent the television display unit and is in communication with the television accessory unit to input data signals into the television accessory unit. Finally, communication means are provided for interfacing the television accessory unit of the local portion to the remote portion for permitting data signals received by the television accessory unit from the input unit to be transmittable from the television accessory unit to the remote portion of the split personal computer system. The data signals are processable by the remote portion to generate output signals. The output signals include video signals and are transmittable from the remote portion to the television accessory unit. The television accessory unit receives the output signals and transmits same to the television display unit as television signals. The system operates in such a manner that the user of the split personal computer system would not realize that the computer was split into two physical portions.</div>

    <heading>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading> <p>This application is a continuation of U.S. Ser. No. 09/014,859, entitled SPLIT PERSONAL COMPUTER SYSTEM (now U.S. Pat. No. 6,243,743), filed on Jan. 29, 1998, the entire content of which is hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <heading>STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT</heading> <p>Not applicable.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Many people currently use several computers in the execution of their job duties. For example, an individual may have one computer located at work, another computer located in an office at home, and yet another computer which is portable to use when the individual is neither at work nor at home. The quickly changing technology in the computer area constantly requires consumers to upgrade their computer systems to meet their demands. This means that the individual must separately upgrade the software and hardware on each of the office computer, the home computer and the portable computer. To upgrade all three computers requires three separate software licenses and hardware items which are costly.</p>
    <p>Communications software for personal computers, such as pcAnywhere obtainable from Symantec Corporation are currently available. These communication software packages permit an individual to control a first computer from a second computer over phone lines.</p>
    <p>Large communication networks are currently in use for providing cable television and telephone services to remote locations, such as homes, offices and hotel rooms. In addition, another large network known as the “internet” is being used to permit remote computers to communicate with each other. Cable television companies have recently been interfacing the cable television networks to the telephone and internet networks to provide access to. all three networks through the cable television connection provided in a large number of homes.</p>
    <p>The companies are working to bring simpler and lower cost internet access to hundreds of millions of households by combining low cost cable television desk top controls with the phone system and a keyboard. This combination of elements and new products will allow users to access the internet and perform interactive tasks such as: a) e-mail; b) database searches; and c) interactive games and advertising.</p>
    <p>Time share computer systems have been used for many years. With conventional time share systems, individuals could connect to a central computer from a so-called “dumb” terminal and purchase time on a shared computer system. The dumb terminal communicated with the shared computer system via either phone line or hard wire remote terminal lines. The time share systems have largely been replaced by a personal computer, or a local area network (LAN) system which connects a large number of personal computers together so that resources can be shared.</p>
    <p>However, these new systems and networks do not address the problems facing computer users which are: 1) fast obsolescence of personal computer models and operating systems; 2) increasing demand for more memory and speed; 3) constant upgrades of software programs; and 4) need for computer portability by more and more people. It is to such an improved split personal computer system that the present invention is directed. The system of the present invention can be implemented by utilizing a programming language called JAVA, which was developed by Sun Microsystems, Inc. The JAVA language is ideally suited to allow communication between the Graphical User Interface (GUI) requirements of a local portion of the split personal computer system and the remote portion of the split personal computer system. The remote portion of the split personal computer system can operate C++ language application programs.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention relates to a split personal computer system including a remote portion and at least one local portion which is disposed remotely from the remote portion. The remote portion of the split personal computer system is adapted to perform the heavy computational and storage portions of the personal computer tasks, and the local portion of the split personal computer system is adapted to solely perform the video and the input/output portions of the personal computer tasks so that an individual manipulating the local portion of the split personal computer system is provided with the illusion of utilizing a complete personal computer system.</p>
    <p>The remote portion of the split personal computer system includes at least one remote computer unit.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of the present invention, the local portion of the split personal computer system includes a television display unit, a television accessory unit in communication with the television display unit, and an input unit located in close proximity to the television display unit and in communication with the television accessory unit to input data signals into the television accessory unit. The television display unit selectively displays television signals output by the television accessory unit in a format perceivable by an individual located near the television display unit.</p>
    <p>The system is also provided with a communication means for interfacing the television accessory unit of the local portion of the split personal computer system with the remote computer unit of the remote portion of the split personal computer system for permitting data signals received by the television accessory unit from the input unit to be transmittable from the television accessory unit to the remote computer unit. The received data signals are processable by the remote computer unit to generate output signals. The output signals are transmittable from the remote computer unit to the television accessory unit, and then transmittable from the television accessory unit to the television display unit as television signals whereby the input unit is capable of functioning as an input unit for the remote computer unit and the television display unit is capable of functioning as a monitor for the remote computer unit to provide the illusion of a complete computer system from the point of view of the individual located adjacent the television display unit.</p>
    <p>One advantage of the present invention is that it permits the individual to operate the remote portion of the split personal computer system, for example, utilizing only the television display unit, the television accessory unit and the input unit. Because television display units are already provided in a large number of locations, such as homes and hotel rooms, the individual need only obtain the television accessory unit and the input unit to remotely operate the remote portion of the split personal computer system.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of the present invention, the remote portion of the split personal computer system communicates with the television accessory unit of the local portion of the split personal computer system over an internet network. The internet network can be interfaced with a cable television network so that internet access is provided from the cable television connection currently provided in homes, hotels and businesses. The television accessory unit can be included in a cable television interface box interconnecting the television display unit to the cable television connection.</p>
    <p>In yet a further embodiment of the present invention, the television accessory unit can be provided in a portable housing. The advantage of the portable housing is that the individual can transport the television accessory unit from one location to another location to remotely operate the remote portion of the split personal computer system with different television display units.</p>
    <p>In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the remote computer unit of the remote portion of the split personal computer system can be provided as a plurality of networked computers which are controlled by a remote system controller. In this embodiment, a plurality of local portions of the split personal computer system are contemplated with each of the local portions of the split personal computer system being disposed remotely from the remote portion of the split personal computer system, and remotely from the other local portions of the split personal computer system. For example, each of the local portions of the split personal computer system could be provided in an individual's home or hotel room or any other location commonly including or adapted to receive a television display unit. The remote system controller can be provided with a billing program which counts the number of minutes that respective local portions of the split personal computer system are operating at least one of the networked computers of the remote portion of the split personal computer system. By employing the remote system controller and the billing program, individuals can “rent” computer time from the remote portion of the split personal computer system and obtain the benefits of a centralized management team upgrading the application software and the hardware on the remote portion of the split personal computer system.</p>

The signals originally transmitted by the remote portion <b>22</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> are forwarded by the signal separator interface <b>54</b> to the local computer <b>52</b>, and the signals originally transmitted by the television station block <b>57</b> are forwarded by the signal separator interface <b>54</b> to the television interface <b>50</b>. The television station block <b>57</b> can be any television station which transmits audio and/or video signals which can be displayed or otherwise output by the television display unit <b>30</b>. A header or other identifier can be included in the signals originally transmitted by the remote portion <b>22</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> so that the signal separator interface <b>54</b> can distinguish between the signals originating from the remote portion <b>22</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> and the television station block <b>57</b>.</p>
    <p>In addition, at least two types of signals can be received by the signal separator interface <b>54</b> from the telephone network controller <b>14</b>: those originating from the remote portion <b>22</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> and those not originating from the remote portion <b>22</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b>. Those signals received by the signal separator interface <b>54</b> from the communication link <b>16</b> <i>a </i>which are originated from the remote portion <b>22</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> are transmitted to the local computer <b>52</b>, and those signals which do not originate from the remote portion <b>22</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> are transmitted to the telephone <b>38</b> via the communication link <b>46</b>, for a purpose to be described hereinafter. A header or other identifier can be included in the signals originally transmitted by the remote portion <b>22</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> so that the signal separator interface can distinguish between the signals originating from the remote portion <b>22</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> and those not originating from the remote portion <b>22</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>The input unit <b>34</b> provides signals to the signal separator interface <b>54</b> over the communication link <b>42</b>. Included in the signals provided to the signal separator interface <b>54</b>, are three different categories of signals. The input unit <b>34</b> may include a header or other identifier in the signals it provides to the signal separator interface <b>54</b> so that the signal separator interface <b>54</b> can distinguish between the three different categories of signals.</p>
    <p>The first category of signals are those which control the television display unit <b>30</b>. Upon receipt of a signal in the first category, the signal separator interface <b>44</b> forwards such signals to the television interface <b>50</b> via a communication link <b>56</b>. The television interface <b>50</b> then forwards such first category signals to the television display unit <b>30</b> so that the television display unit <b>30</b> will receive such first category signals and respond accordingly. First category signals include those signals which change the channel or volume of the television display unit <b>30</b>, for example. Before the television accessory unit <b>32</b> can be utilized to access the remote portion <b>22</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b>, an individual located adjacent the television display unit <b>20</b> operates the input unit <b>34</b> to tune the television display unit <b>20</b> to a suitable channel to receive television signals from the television accessory unit <b>32</b> via a communication link <b>40</b> so that the television display unit <b>30</b> selectively displays television signals output by the television accessory unit <b>32</b> in a format perceivable by at least one individual located adjacent the television display unit <b>30</b>.</p>
    <p>The second category of signals transmitted from the input unit <b>34</b> to the signal separator interface <b>54</b> are those signals intended to control or operate the local computer <b>52</b>. Upon receipt of a second category signal, the signal separator interface <b>54</b> outputs such second category signal to the local computer <b>52</b> via a communication link <b>58</b>. The second category signals can be the normal computer control signals plus a special remote logon command that can either be a set of keyboard strokes or a special function key provided on the input unit <b>34</b> for this purpose. Upon receipt of the remote logon command, the operating system software of the local computer <b>52</b> outputs signals to the television interface <b>50</b> which formats such signals as television signals. The television interface <b>50</b> then transmits the television signals to the television display unit <b>30</b> to cause the screen (or at least some portion thereof) of the television display unit <b>30</b> to appear as a normal personal computer screen selected by the individual (e.g. Windows 95, Windows 3.1, Macintosh, OS/2, NT95 or any other common PC screen used by the individual).</p>
    <p>In addition, the receipt of the remote logon command causes the operating system software of the local computer <b>52</b> to output the remote logon command to the telephone network controller <b>14</b> via the communication links <b>58</b> and <b>16</b> <i>a</i>. The telephone network controller <b>14</b> transmits the remote logon command to the remote system controller <b>26</b> via the communication link <b>27</b> <i>a</i>. The remote system controller <b>26</b> receives the remote logon command, and in response thereto, the remote system controller <b>26</b> checks the remote logon command for validity and allows connection to at least one of the remote computer units <b>24</b> if the remote logon command is valid and prohibits connection of the remote portion <b>22</b> to the local portion <b>12</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> if the particular remote logon command is not valid. The validity of the remote logon command can be determined in a manner recited in U.S. Pat. No. 4,528,643, issued to Charles C. Freeny on Jul. 9, 1985, which disclosure is hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <p>Once the local portion <b>12</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> and the remote portion <b>22</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> are connected to permit communication therebetween, the remote portion <b>22</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> provides video signals to the local portion <b>12</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> via the sequential communication links <b>27</b> <i>b </i>and <b>20</b> <i>a</i>, and data signals to the local portion <b>12</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> via the sequential communication links <b>27</b> <i>a </i>and <b>16</b> <i>a</i>. The video and data signals transmitted from the remote portion <b>22</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> are received by the signal separator interface <b>54</b> and then forwarded to the local computer <b>52</b> via the communication link <b>58</b>. The local computer <b>52</b> receives the video and data signals, and then the operating system of the local computer <b>52</b> transmits the video and data signals to the television interface <b>50</b> via a communication link <b>60</b>. The television interface <b>50</b> then formats the video and data signals into audio television signals, video television signals or audio and video television signals. The television signals are then transmitted to the television display unit <b>30</b> so that the television signals are perceivable by the individual located adjacent the television display unit <b>30</b>.</p>
    <p>The third category of signals provided from the input unit <b>34</b> to the signal separator interface <b>54</b> can be those associated with mouse signals (point and click signals) or keyboard typing signals or any other suitable data input signals. The third category of signals are transmitted from the signal separator interface, <b>54</b> to at least one of the remote computer units <b>24</b> via the sequential communication links <b>16</b> <i>a</i>, <b>27</b> <i>a </i>and <b>28</b> <i>a</i>. The remote computer unit <b>24</b> <i>a </i>receives such transmitted signals and processes same with at least one of the application computer programs to generate output signals including video and data signals. The video signals are transmitted from the remote computer unit <b>24</b> <i>a </i>to the signal separator interface <b>54</b> of the television accessory unit <b>32</b> via the sequential communication links <b>28</b> <i>a</i>, <b>27</b> <i>b </i>and <b>20</b> <i>a</i>. The data signals are transmitted from the remote computer unit <b>24</b> <i>a </i>to the signal separator interface <b>54</b> of the television accessory unit <b>32</b> via the sequential communication links <b>28</b> <i>a</i>, <b>27</b> <i>a </i>and <b>16</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p>The signal separator interface <b>54</b> receives the video and data signals and in response thereto, the signal separator interface <b>54</b> transmits such video and data signals to the local computer <b>52</b> via the communication link <b>58</b>. The local computer <b>52</b> receives the video and data signals and transmits at least some of such video and data signals to the television display unit <b>30</b> via the television interface <b>50</b> to update the screen. Some of the data signals received by the local computer <b>52</b> can be directed to the output unit <b>36</b> to provide tangible and/or intangible output of the data signals.</p>
    <p>The above stated process is then repeated a plurality of times so that the local and remote portions <b>12</b> and <b>22</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> cooperate to provide the illusion of a single complete personal computer system to the individual located at the local portion <b>12</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b>. That is, the remote portion <b>22</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> provides the individual utilizing the local portion <b>12</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> with access to the application software packages stored on the remote portion <b>22</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b>, and data stored on the remote portion <b>22</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> on behalf of the individual in conjunction with previous usage. The local portion <b>12</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> provides the individual with visual feedback via the television display unit <b>30</b>, and input and output capabilities via the input unit <b>34</b> and the output unit <b>36</b>.</p>
    <p>Shown in FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram of the remote portion <b>22</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b>. The remote computer units <b>24</b> are substantially identical in construction and function. Thus, only the remote computer unit <b>24</b> <i>a </i>will be described herein for purposes of clarity. However, like components on the remote computer units <b>24</b> <i>a </i>and <b>24</b> <i>b </i>will be designated with the same numeral, but different alphabetic suffixes “a” and “b”, respectively.</p>
    <p>The remote computer unit <b>24</b> <i>a </i>is provided with a permanent memory <b>70</b> <i>a</i>, a central processing unit <b>72</b> <i>a </i>and a random access memory (RAM) <b>74</b> <i>a</i>. The central processing unit <b>72</b> <i>a </i>can communicate with the permanent memory <b>70</b> <i>a </i>and the random access memory <b>74</b> <i>a </i>via communication links <b>76</b> <i>a </i>and <b>78</b> <i>a </i>in a manner well known in the art. The remote computer units <b>24</b> can be provided with operating system software stored either on the permanent memory <b>70</b> or the random access memory <b>74</b> to permit more than one individual to simultaneously utilize or share each of the permanent memory <b>70</b>, central processing unit <b>72</b>, and/or random access memory <b>74</b> on the remote computer units <b>24</b> to conserve resources. The remote computer units <b>24</b> can be loaded with any or all of the application software currently available, such as WordPerfect®, Lotus 1,2,3®, Excel®, MS Word® and Access® brand software, for example.</p>
    <p>Although more than one local portion <b>12</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> can communicate with the remote portion <b>22</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> simultaneously, the probability that all of the local portions <b>12</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> will utilize the remote portion <b>22</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> simultaneously is slim. To further conserve resources, the remote portion <b>22</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> desirably has less remote computer units <b>24</b> than the number of local portions <b>12</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> which have access thereto.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment, a method for utilizing the split personal computer system <b>10</b> includes the step of inputting respective data signals into at least two of the television accessory units <b>32</b> of the local portions <b>12</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b>. The television accessory units <b>32</b>, then output the respective data signals to the remote portion <b>22</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> via respective communication links <b>16</b> <i>a </i>and <b>16</b> <i>b</i>, the telephone network controller <b>14</b> and the communication link <b>27</b> <i>a</i>. The remote portion <b>22</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> receives the respective data signals. The respective data signals are then forwarded to at least one of the remote computer units <b>24</b> which then processes the respective data signals with at least one application program to generate output signals.</p>
    <p>The output signals are then output by the remote portion <b>22</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> to the television accessory units <b>32</b> via the communication link <b>27</b> <i>b</i>, the television network controller <b>18</b>, and the communication links <b>20</b> <i>a </i>and <b>20</b> <i>b </i>such that output signals are received by the television accessory unit <b>32</b> which correspond to the data signals input to that respective television accessory unit <b>32</b>. Each television accessory unit <b>32</b> outputs the respective output signals received from the remote portion <b>22</b> of the split personal computer system <b>10</b> to the television display unit <b>30</b> as television signals. And, each television display unit <b>30</b> receives the television signals output by the respective television accessory units <b>32</b> and then outputs the television signals in a format perceivable by at least one individual located near the television display unit <b>30</b>.</p>
    <p>Although only one cycle of the method is described herein, it should be understood that such method can be repeated any number of times so that respective individuals are simultaneously provided with the illusion of operating a complete personal computer system.</p>
    <p>Shown in FIG. 4 is the television accessory unit <b>32</b> disposed on top of the television display unit <b>30</b>. As shown, the television accessory unit <b>32</b> having the portable housing <b>55</b> can be in the form of a cable television interface box interconnecting the television display unit <b>30</b> to a cable television connection <b>80</b>. The cable television connection <b>80</b> is desirably interfaced with both the telephone network controller <b>14</b> and the television network controller <b>18</b> so that telephone, internet and television access, for example, is provided from the cable television connection <b>80</b> currently provided in suitable locations such as homes, hotels and businesses.</p>
    <p>Although the present invention has been shown and described herein as operating with the television display unit <b>30</b>, it should be understood that the present invention should not be limited to including, the television display unit <b>30</b>. For example, a monitor or other type of output unit can be utilized in place of the television display unit <b>30</b>.</p>
    <p>Changes may be made in the construction and the operation of the various components, elements and assemblies described herein and changes may be made in the steps or the sequence of steps of the methods described herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims.</p>
