<heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading> <p num="p-0002">This application claims the benefit of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 60/430,481, filed Dec. 3, 2002, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 60/470,328, filed May 13, 2003, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading> <p num="p-0003">The present invention relates generally to medical and pharmaceutical equipment, and more particularly, to an automated apparatus for reconstituting and later delivering a prescribed unit dose of medication to an automated syringe preparation system.</p>
  <heading>BACKGROUND</heading> <p num="p-0004">Disposable syringes are in widespread use for a number of different types of applications. For example, syringes are used not only to withdraw a fluid (e.g., blood) from a patient but also to administer a medication to a patient. In the latter, a cap or the like is removed from the syringe and a unit dose of the medication is carefully measured and then injected or otherwise disposed within the syringe.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">As technology advances, more and more sophisticated, automated systems are being developed for preparing and delivering medications by integrating a number of different stations, with one or more specific tasks being performed at each station. For example, one type of exemplary automated system operates as a syringe filling apparatus that receives user inputted information, such as the type of medication, the volume of the medication and any mixing instructions, etc. The system then uses this inputted information to disperse the correct medication into the syringe up to the inputted volume.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">In some instances, the medication that is to be delivered to the patient includes more than one pharmaceutical substance. For example, the medication can be a mixture of several components, such as several pharmaceutical substances.</p>
  <p num="p-0007">By automating the medication preparation process, increased production and efficiency are achieved. This results in reduced production costs and also permits the system to operate over any time period of a given day with only limited operator intervention for manual inspection to ensure proper operation is being achieved. Such a system finds particular utility in settings, such as large hospitals, including a large number of doses of medications that must be prepared daily. Traditionally, these doses have been prepared manually in what is an exacting but tedious responsibility for a highly skilled staff. In order to be valuable, automated systems must maintain the exacting standards set by medical regulatory organizations, while at the same time simplifying the overall process and reducing the time necessary for preparing the medications.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">Because syringes are used often as the carrier means for transporting and delivering the medication to the patient, it is advantageous for these automated systems to be tailored to accept syringes. However, the previous methods of dispersing the medication from the vial and into the syringe were very time consuming and labor intensive. More specifically, medications and the like are typically stored in a vial that is sealed with a safety cap or the like. In conventional medication preparation, a trained person retrieves the correct vial from a storage cabinet or the like, confirms the contents and then removes the safety cap manually. This is typically done by simply popping the safety cap off with one's hands. Once the safety cap is removed, the trained person inspects the integrity of the membrane and cleans the membrane. An instrument, e.g., a needle, is then used to pierce the membrane and withdraw the medication contained in the vial. The withdrawn medication is then placed into a syringe to permit subsequent administration of the medication from the syringe.</p>
  <p num="p-0009"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary conventional syringe <b>10</b> that includes a barrel <b>20</b> having an elongated body <b>22</b> that defines a chamber <b>30</b> that receives and holds a medication that is disposed at a later time. The barrel <b>20</b> has an open proximal end <b>24</b> with a flange <b>25</b> being formed thereat and it also includes an opposing distal end <b>26</b> that has a barrel tip <b>28</b> that has a passageway <b>29</b> formed therethrough. One end of the passageway <b>29</b> opens into the chamber <b>30</b> to provide communication between the barrel tip <b>28</b> and the chamber <b>30</b> and the opposing end of the passageway <b>29</b> is open to permit the medication to be dispensed through a cannula (not shown) or the like that is later coupled to the barrel tip <b>28</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">An outer surface of the barrel tip or luer <b>28</b> can include features to permit fastening with a cap or other type of enclosing member. For example, the luer can have threads <b>27</b> that permit a tip cap <b>40</b> to be securely and removably coupled to the barrel tip <b>28</b>. The tip cap <b>40</b> thus has complementary fastening features that permit it to be securely coupled to the barrel tip or luer <b>28</b>. The tip cap <b>40</b> is constructed so that it closes off the passageway <b>29</b> to permit the syringe <b>10</b> to be stored and/or transported with a predetermined amount of medication disposed within the chamber <b>30</b>. As previously mentioned, the term “medication” refers to a medicinal preparation for administration to a patient and most often, the medication is contained within the chamber <b>30</b> in a liquid state even though the medication initially may have been in a solid state, which was processed into a liquid state.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">The syringe <b>10</b> further includes a plunger <b>50</b> that is removably and adjustably disposed within the barrel <b>20</b>. More specifically, the plunger <b>50</b> is also an elongated member that has a proximal end <b>52</b> that terminates in a flange <b>54</b> to permit a user to easily grip and manipulate the plunger <b>50</b> within the barrel <b>20</b>. Preferably, the plunger flange <b>54</b> is slightly smaller than the barrel flange <b>25</b> so that the user can place several fingers around, against, or near the barrel flange <b>25</b> to hold the barrel <b>20</b> and then use fingers of the other hand to withdraw or push the plunger <b>50</b> forward within the barrel <b>20</b>. An opposite distal end <b>56</b> of the plunger <b>50</b> terminates in a stopper <b>59</b> or the like that seals against the inner surface of the barrel <b>20</b> within the chamber <b>30</b>. The plunger <b>50</b> can draw a fluid (e.g., air or a liquid) into the chamber <b>30</b> by withdrawing the plunger <b>50</b> from an initial position where the stopper <b>59</b> is near or at the barrel tip or luer <b>28</b> to a position where the stopper <b>59</b> is near the proximal end <b>24</b> of the barrel <b>20</b>. Conversely, the plunger <b>50</b> can be used to expel or dispense medication by first withdrawing the plunger <b>50</b> to a predetermined location, filling the chamber <b>30</b> with medication and then applying force against the flange <b>54</b> so as to move the plunger <b>50</b> forward within the chamber <b>30</b>, resulting in a decrease in the volume of the chamber <b>30</b> and therefore causing the medication to be forced into and out of the barrel tip or luer <b>28</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0012">Typically, a drug is provided of the shelf in solid form within an injectable drug vial that is initially stored in a drug cabinet or the like. To prepare an injectable unit dose of medication, a prescribed amount of diluent (water or some other liquid) is added to the vial to cause the solid drug to go completely into solution. Mixing and agitation of the vial contents is usually required. This can be a time consuming and labor intensive operation since first it must be determined how much diluent to add to achieve the desired concentration of medication and then this precise amount needs to be added and then the vial contents need to be mixed for a predetermined time period to ensure that all of the solid goes into solution. Thus, there is room for human error in that the incorrect amount of diluent may be added, thereby producing medication that has a concentration that is higher or lower than it should be. This can potentially place the patient at risk and furthermore, the reconstitution process can be very labor intensive since it can entail preparing a considerable number of medication syringes that all can have different medication formulations. This also can lead to confusion and possibly human error.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">What is needed in the art and has heretofore not been available is a system and method for automating the medication preparation process and more specifically, an automated apparatus for reconstituting and then delivering a prescribed amount of medication to a syringe or the like.</p>
  <heading>SUMMARY</heading> <p num="p-0014">In one exemplary embodiment, an automated medication preparation system including automated syringe preparation that involves reconstitution of the medication is provided. The system includes: (1) a first automated gripping means for removing a tip cap from a barrel of one syringe and placing the removed tip cap at a first location; (2) an automated device for delivering a prescribed dosage amount of medication to the syringe by delivering the medication through the uncapped barrel in a just-in-time for use manner; (3) a controller in communication with the automated device and including a database for storing reconstitution information that is executable with the automated device for reconstituting the medication prior to it being injected into the syringe, wherein the reconstitution information include at least a concentration of the resultant medication and a mixing time for agitating the medication; and (4) a second automated gripping means for replacing the removed tip cap on the syringe barrel after the medication is injected therein.</p>

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p num="p-0044"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating one exemplary automated system, generally indicated at <b>100</b>, for the preparation of a medication. The automated system <b>100</b> is divided into a number of stations where a specific task is performed based on the automated system <b>100</b> receiving user input instructions, processing these instructions and then preparing unit doses of one or more medications in accordance with the instructions. The automated system <b>100</b> includes a station <b>110</b> where medications and other substances used in the preparation process are stored. As used herein, the term “medication” refers to a medicinal preparation for administration to a patient. Often, the medication is initially stored as a solid, e.g., a powder, to which a diluent is added to form a medicinal composition. Thus, the station <b>110</b> functions as a storage unit for storing one or medications, etc. under proper storage conditions. Typically, medications and the like are stored in sealed containers, such as vials, that are labeled to clearly indicate the contents of each vial.</p>
  <p num="p-0045">A first station <b>120</b> is a syringe storage station that houses and stores a number of syringes. For example, up to 500 syringes or more can be disposed in the first station <b>120</b> for storage and later use. The first station <b>120</b> can be in the form of a bin or the like or any other type of structure than can hold a number of syringes. In one exemplary embodiment, the syringes are provided as a bandolier structure that permits the syringes to be fed into the other components of the system <b>100</b> using standard delivery techniques, such as a conveyor belt, etc.</p>
  <p num="p-0046">The system <b>100</b> also includes a rotary apparatus <b>130</b> for advancing the fed syringes from and to various stations of the system <b>100</b>. A number of the stations are arranged circumferentially around the rotary apparatus <b>130</b> so that the syringe is first loaded at the first station <b>120</b> and then rotated a predetermined distance to a next station, etc. as the medication preparation process advances. At each station, a different operation is performed with the end result being that a unit dose of medication is disposed within the syringe that is then ready to be administered.</p>
  <p num="p-0047">One exemplary type of rotary apparatus <b>130</b> is a multiple station cam-indexing dial that is adapted to perform material handling operations. The indexer is configured to have multiple stations positioned thereabout with individual nests for each station position. One syringe is held within one nest using any number of suitable techniques, including opposing spring-loaded fingers that act to clamp the syringe in its respective nest. The indexer permits the rotary apparatus <b>130</b> to be advanced at specific intervals.</p>
  <p num="p-0048">At a second station <b>140</b>, the syringes are loaded into one of the nests of the rotary apparatus <b>130</b>. One syringe is loaded into one nest of the rotary apparatus <b>130</b> in which the syringe is securely held in place. The system <b>100</b> preferably includes additional mechanisms for preparing the syringe for use, such as removing a tip cap and extending a plunger of the syringe at a third station <b>150</b>. At this point, the syringe is ready for use.</p>
  <p num="p-0049">The system <b>100</b> also preferably includes a reading device (not shown) that is capable of reading a label disposed on the sealed container containing the medication. The label is read using any number of suitable reader/scanner devices, such as a bar code reader, etc., so as to confirm that the proper medication has been selected from the storage unit of the station <b>110</b>. Multiple readers can be employed in the system at various locations to confirm the accuracy of the entire process. Once the system <b>100</b> confirms that the sealed container that has been selected contains the proper medication, the container is delivered to a fourth station <b>160</b> using an automated mechanism, such a robotic gripping device as will be described in greater detail. At the fourth station <b>160</b>, the vial is prepared by removing the safety cap from the sealed container and then cleaning the exposed end of the vial. Preferably, the safety cap is removed on a deck of the automated system <b>100</b> having a controlled environment. In this manner, the safety cap is removed just-in-time for use.</p>
  <p num="p-0050">The system <b>100</b> also preferably includes a fifth station (fluid transfer station) <b>170</b> for injecting or delivering a diluent into the medication contained in the sealed container and then subsequently mixing the medication and the diluent to form the medication composition that is to be disposed into the prepared syringe. At this fluid transfer station, the prepared medication composition is withdrawn from the container (i.e., vial) and is then delivered into the syringe. For example, a cannula can be inserted into the sealed vial and the medication composition then aspirated into a cannula set. The cannula is then withdrawn from the vial and is then rotated relative to the rotary apparatus <b>130</b> so that it is in line with (above, below, etc.) the syringe. The unit dose of the medication composition is then delivered to the syringe, as well as additional diluent if necessary or desired. The tip cap is then placed back on the syringe at a sixth station <b>180</b>. A seventh station <b>190</b> prints and station <b>195</b> applies a label to the syringe and a device, such as a reader, can be used to verify that this label is placed in a correct location and the printing thereon is readable. Also, the reader can confirm that the label properly identifies the medication composition that is contained in the syringe. The syringe is then unloaded from the rotary apparatus <b>130</b> at an unloading station <b>200</b> and delivered to a predetermined location, such as a new order bin, a conveyor, a sorting device, or a reject bin. The delivery of the syringe can be accomplished using a standard conveyor or other type of apparatus. If the syringe is provided as a part of the previously-mentioned syringe bandolier, the bandolier is cut prior at a station <b>198</b> located prior to the unloading station <b>200</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0051"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 20</figref> illustrate parts of the third station <b>150</b> for preparing a syringe, the fluid transfer station <b>170</b>, and the sixth station <b>180</b> for preparing the syringe for later use. In other words, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-15</figref> illustrate in more detail the stations and automated devices that are used in removal of the tip cap <b>40</b> from the barrel tip <b>28</b>, the filling of barrel chamber <b>30</b> with medication and the replacement of the tip cap <b>40</b> on the barrel tip <b>28</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view of an automated device <b>300</b> that removes the tip cap <b>40</b> from the barrel tip <b>28</b> as the syringe <b>10</b> is prepared for receiving a prescribed dose of medication as part of the third station <b>150</b> of the automated medication preparation system <b>100</b>. The device <b>300</b> is a controllable device that is operatively connected to a control unit, such as a computer, which drives the device <b>300</b> to specific locations at selected times. The control unit can be a personal computer that runs one or more programs to ensure coordinated operation of all of the components of the system <b>100</b>. The device <b>300</b> and other suitable devices described in greater detail in U.S. Ser. No. 10/426,910, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
  <p num="p-0052">As previously mentioned, one exemplary rotary device <b>130</b> is a multiple station cam-indexing dial that is adapted to perform material handling operations. The dial <b>130</b> has an upper surface <b>132</b> and first and second retaining members <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> for securely holding one syringe <b>10</b> in a releasable manner. More specifically, the first retaining member <b>134</b> locates the barrel <b>20</b> near the distal end <b>24</b> thereof and the second retaining member <b>136</b> grips and holds the barrel <b>20</b> near the proximal end <b>22</b> thereof. One exemplary first retaining member <b>134</b> includes an arm <b>135</b> that is integral to the upper surface <b>132</b> of the rotary device <b>130</b> and extends outwardly from a main peripheral edge <b>137</b> of the dial. The arm <b>135</b> has a notch <b>139</b> formed at a distal end thereof that is complementary in shape and size to the outer surface of the syringe <b>10</b> so that the syringe barrel <b>20</b> is received and held within the notch <b>139</b>. The notch <b>139</b> is defined by a pair of opposing fingers <b>141</b>, with the notch <b>139</b> being formed therebetween. The notch <b>139</b> is thus V-shaped in this exemplary embodiment.</p>
  <p num="p-0053">The second retaining member <b>136</b> is configured to hold and retain the proximal end <b>22</b> of the barrel <b>20</b>. The second retaining member <b>136</b> includes operable pivotable arms <b>143</b>, <b>145</b> that pivot between an open position where the syringe <b>10</b> is free to be removed from the dial <b>130</b> and a closed position in which the syringe <b>10</b> is securely held on the dial <b>130</b>. A shaped surface <b>151</b> also forms a part of the retaining member <b>136</b> and is disposed behind the pivotable arms <b>143</b>, <b>145</b>. The syringe <b>10</b> is disposed between the pivotable arms <b>143</b>, <b>145</b> and the surface <b>151</b> and in the retained position, the pivotable arms <b>143</b>, <b>145</b> are in the closed position and the syringe <b>10</b> is held securely between the pivotable arms <b>143</b>, <b>145</b> and the surface <b>151</b>. As will be described in greater detail hereinafter, the controller directs the pivotable arms <b>143</b>, <b>145</b> to either the open or closed positions.</p>
  <p num="p-0054">A post <b>161</b> is provided for holding the tip cap <b>40</b> after its removal to permit the chamber <b>30</b> to be filled with medication. One exemplary post <b>161</b> has a circular cross-section and is formed near or at the interface between the arm <b>135</b> and the dial <b>130</b>. The post <b>161</b> can also be formed on the upper surface <b>132</b> of the dial <b>130</b>. Thus, the precise location of the post <b>161</b> can vary so long as the post <b>161</b> is located where the tip cap <b>40</b> can sit without interfering with the operation of any of the automated devices and also the post <b>161</b> should not be unnecessarily too far away from the held syringe <b>10</b> since it is desired for the automated devices to travel a minimum distance during their operation to improve the overall efficiency of the system <b>100</b>. The specific shape of the post <b>161</b> can likewise vary so long as the post <b>161</b> can hold the tip cap <b>40</b> so that it remains on the post <b>161</b> during the rotation of the dial <b>130</b> as the associated syringe <b>10</b> is advanced from one station to another station.</p>
  <p num="p-0055">While in one exemplary embodiment, the syringes <b>10</b> are fed to the rotary device <b>130</b> as part of a syringe bandolier (i.e., multiple syringes <b>10</b> are disposed in series and interconnected by a web), it will be appreciated that the syringes <b>10</b> can be fed to the rotary device <b>130</b> in any number of other ways. For example, the syringes <b>10</b> can be fed individually into the rotary device <b>130</b> from a loose supply of syringes <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0056">The automated device <b>300</b> is a robotic device and preferably, the automated device <b>300</b> is a linear actuator with a gripper. The device <b>300</b> has a vertical base <b>310</b> which is adjustable in at least several directions. For example, the vertical base <b>310</b> has an independent reach (y axis) and vertical axis (x axis) which provides part of the flexibility and motion control that is desirable for the device <b>300</b>. The vertical base <b>310</b> has an upper end <b>312</b> and an opposing lower end <b>314</b> which is operatively coupled to other movable components to permit the vertical base <b>310</b> to move in an up/down direction along the x axis and in lateral directions along the y axis. The upper end <b>312</b> is connected to a horizontal support member <b>320</b> that extends outwardly away from the vertical base <b>310</b>. In one exemplary embodiment, the lower end <b>314</b> is disposed between two support beams that are part of a robotic device and are moved in a number of different directions, including along the x axis and the y axis.</p>
  <p num="p-0057">A block member <b>330</b> is connected to the horizontal support member <b>320</b> and more specifically, the block member <b>330</b> is disposed on an underside of the horizontal support member <b>320</b> so that it is spaced away from the vertical base <b>310</b>. The exemplary block member <b>330</b> has a block-like shape and is connected to the underside of the horizontal support member <b>320</b> by one or more connectors that can be in the form of support columns, etc.</p>
  <p num="p-0058">The device <b>300</b> has first and second positionable gripping arms <b>340</b>, <b>350</b> which are adjustable in at least one direction and which are coupled to and extend downwardly from the block member <b>330</b>. For example, each of the gripping arms <b>340</b>, <b>350</b> is movable at least in a direction along the y axis which provide the flexibility and motion control that is desirable in the present system <b>100</b>. The gripping arms <b>340</b>, <b>350</b> are programmed to work together in tandem so that both arms <b>340</b>, <b>350</b> are driven to the same location and the same time.</p>
  <p num="p-0059">The block member <b>330</b> can house some of the electronic components and the like that permit the gripping arms <b>340</b>, <b>350</b> to move between the open and closed positions. The coupling between the block member <b>330</b> and the gripping arms <b>340</b>, <b>350</b> is such that the gripping arms <b>340</b>, <b>350</b> have the necessary degree of movement to permit the opening and closing thereof.</p>
  <p num="p-0060">Each of the gripping arms <b>340</b>, <b>350</b> is a generally L-shaped member that is formed of a vertical section <b>342</b> and a horizontal gripping section <b>344</b> that extends outwardly from one end of the vertical section <b>342</b>. The gripping section <b>344</b> has a cut-out or notch <b>360</b> formed therein for receiving and gripping a section of the tip cap <b>40</b> of the syringe <b>10</b>. Accordingly, the notch <b>360</b> has a complementary shape as the shape of the tip cap <b>40</b>. One exemplary notch <b>360</b> has a generally semi-circular shape and it seats against approximately ½ of the outer circumferential surface of the tip cap <b>40</b>. By being movable along at least the y axis, the gripping arms <b>340</b>, <b>350</b> can be positioned between an open position in which the opposing gripping sections <b>344</b> of the arms <b>340</b>, <b>350</b> are spaced apart from one another a sufficient distance to permit the tip cap <b>40</b> to be received therebetween.</p>
  <p num="p-0061">The tip cap <b>40</b> has a base section <b>41</b> and a flange <b>43</b> that has a diameter that is greater than the diameter of the base section <b>41</b>. The gripping sections <b>344</b> of the arms <b>340</b>, <b>350</b> are contoured to seat against the outer circumferential surface of the base section <b>41</b> of the tip cap <b>40</b>. In the closed position, the gripping sections <b>344</b> of the arms <b>340</b>, <b>350</b> are brought together so that they either seat against one another or are in very close proximity to one another. When the gripping sections <b>344</b> come together in the closed position, the notches <b>360</b> define a complete circular opening that has a diameter about equal to or slightly less than the diameter of the base section <b>41</b> of the tip cap <b>40</b>, thereby permitting the tip cap <b>40</b> to nest within the gripping sections <b>344</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0062">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a first open position of the gripping arms <b>340</b>, <b>350</b> is illustrated with the gripping sections <b>344</b> being spaced sufficiently from one another so as to permit the tip cap <b>40</b> to be freely disposed between the gripping sections <b>344</b>. Using a control unit <b>370</b> (e.g., a programmable actuator, microprocessor, etc.), the gripping arms <b>340</b>, <b>350</b> are driven to the first position shown in FIG. <b>4</b>. The control unit <b>370</b> instructs the device <b>300</b> to perform an operation where the tip cap <b>40</b> is gripped and removed by the device <b>300</b>. When such an operation is performed, the vertical base <b>310</b> is driven inwardly toward the dial <b>130</b> and relative to the syringe <b>10</b> so that the gripping arms <b>340</b>, <b>350</b> are positioned over the tip cap <b>40</b> that is disposed on top of the syringe <b>10</b>. The vertical base <b>310</b> is then driven downward until the gripping arms <b>340</b>, <b>350</b> are disposed around the tip cap <b>40</b>. In other words, the tip cap <b>40</b> is disposed between the gripping section <b>344</b> of the opposing arms <b>340</b>, <b>350</b> and more specifically, the gripping sections <b>344</b> are disposed adjacent the base section <b>41</b> of the tip cap <b>40</b> underneath the flange <b>43</b> with the notches <b>360</b> being aligned with the outer surface of the base section <b>41</b>. An actuator or the like of the device <b>300</b> is then activated causing the gripping arms <b>340</b>, <b>350</b> to move inwardly toward one another until the gripping sections <b>344</b> seat against the outer surface of the base section <b>41</b> of the tip cap <b>40</b>. In this closed position, the gripping arms <b>340</b>, <b>350</b> apply a force against the base section <b>41</b> so that the tip cap <b>40</b> is securely held by the gripping sections <b>344</b>. When the gripping arms <b>340</b>, <b>350</b> are driven to the closed position, the gripping sections <b>344</b> seat against one another and the notches <b>360</b> align such that the gripping sections <b>344</b> substantially encircle the base section <b>41</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0063">The apparatus <b>300</b> can be driven in any number of different ways that are known and suitable for this intended use. For example, the apparatus <b>300</b> can be pneumatically based according to one exemplary embodiment and as shown in FIG. <b>3</b>. In this embodiment, a number of pneumatic conduits are provided for moving the gripping arms <b>340</b>, <b>350</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0064">After the tip cap <b>40</b> is nested within the gripping sections <b>344</b>, the control unit <b>370</b> directs the vertical base <b>310</b> upward and this motion causes the tip cap <b>40</b> to be displaced from the barrel tip <b>28</b> as shown in phantom in FIG. <b>5</b>. After the tip cap <b>40</b> is freed from the barrel tip <b>28</b>, it remains held between the gripping sections <b>344</b> of the opposing arms <b>340</b>, <b>350</b>. The vertical base <b>310</b> is then driven more inward, as indicated by arrow <b>311</b>, toward the dial <b>130</b> until the held tip cap <b>40</b> is positioned over the post <b>161</b>. Once the tip cap <b>40</b> is disposed over the post <b>161</b>, the controller <b>370</b> instructs the vertical base <b>310</b> to move downwardly so that the post <b>161</b> is disposed within a hollow interior of the tip cap <b>40</b>. The actuator is then activated causing the gripping arms <b>340</b>, <b>350</b> to move to the open position, thereby releasing the tip cap <b>40</b> as shown in FIG. <b>5</b>. Because the tip cap <b>40</b> sits on the post <b>161</b>, its movement is restricted after the gripping arms <b>340</b>, <b>350</b> release their gripping action therefrom and the tip cap <b>40</b> remains seated on the post <b>161</b> as the rotary device <b>130</b> advances to deliver the uncapped syringe <b>10</b> to another station. The device <b>300</b> then is returned to its initial position, the dial <b>130</b> is advanced and the operation is repeated with the device <b>300</b> gripping and removing one tip cap <b>40</b> from the next capped syringe <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0065">Now referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>, the system <b>100</b> also includes a device <b>400</b> for extending the plunger <b>50</b> of one uncapped syringe <b>10</b> after it has had its tip cap <b>40</b> removed therefrom. For ease of illustration, the device <b>400</b> as well as the device <b>300</b> are described as being part of the third station <b>150</b> of the system <b>100</b>. The device <b>400</b> extends the plunger <b>50</b> so that the syringe <b>10</b> can receive a desired dose based upon the particular syringe <b>10</b> being used and the type of application (e.g., patient's needs) that the syringe <b>10</b> is to be used for. The device <b>400</b> can have any number of configurations so long as it contains a feature that is designed to make contact with and withdraw the plunger <b>50</b>. In one exemplary embodiment, the automated device <b>400</b> is a robotic device and preferably, the automated device <b>400</b> is a linear actuator with a gripper. For example, one exemplary device <b>400</b> is a mechanical device that has a movable gripper <b>410</b> that includes a gripping edge <b>420</b> that engages the flange <b>54</b> of the plunger <b>50</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, and then the gripper <b>410</b> is moved in a downward direction causing the plunger <b>50</b> to be moved a predetermined amount as shown in FIG. <b>8</b>. For example, the gripper <b>410</b> can be the part of an extendable/retractable arm that includes the gripping edge <b>420</b> for engaging the syringe <b>10</b> above the plunger flange <b>54</b>. When an actuator or the like causes the gripper <b>410</b> to move in a downward direction, the gripping edge <b>420</b> seats against the flange <b>54</b> and further movement of the gripper <b>410</b> causes the extension of the plunger <b>50</b>. Once the plunger <b>50</b> has been extended the prescribed distance, the gripper <b>410</b> moves laterally away from the plunger <b>50</b> so that the interference between the flange <b>54</b> of the plunger <b>50</b> and the gripping edge <b>420</b> no longer exits. In other words, the gripper <b>410</b> is free of engagement with the plunger <b>50</b> and can therefore be positioned back into its initial position by being moved laterally and/or in an up/down direction (e.g., the gripper <b>410</b> can move upward to its initial position). Another exemplary plunger extending device is described in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/457,066, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
  <p num="p-0066">Thus, the device <b>400</b> complements the device <b>300</b> in getting the syringe <b>10</b> ready for the fluid transfer station at which time, a prescribed amount of medication is dispensed into the chamber <b>30</b> of the barrel <b>20</b> as will be described in greater detail hereinafter.</p>
  <p num="p-0067">The device <b>400</b> is part of the overall programmable system and therefore, the distance that the gripper <b>410</b> corresponds to a prescribed movement of the plunger <b>50</b> and a corresponding increase in the available volume of the chamber <b>30</b> of the barrel <b>20</b>. For example, if the prescribed unit dose for a particular syringe <b>10</b> is 8 ml, then the controller instructs the device <b>400</b> to move the gripper <b>410</b> a predetermined distance that corresponds with the plunger <b>50</b> moving the necessary distance so that the volume of the barrel chamber <b>30</b> is at least 8 ml. This permits the unit dose of 8 ml to be delivered into the barrel chamber <b>30</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0068">In one example, after the syringe <b>10</b> has been prepared by removing the tip cap <b>40</b> and extending the plunger <b>50</b> a prescribed distance, the syringe <b>10</b> is then delivered to a fluid transfer station where a fluid transfer device <b>500</b> prepare and delivers the desired amount of medication.</p>
  <p num="p-0069">Now turning to FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>9</b>-<b>20</b> in which a drug preparation area is illustrated in greater detail to show the individual components thereof. More specifically, a drug transfer area <b>500</b> is illustrated and is located proximate the rotary dial <b>130</b> so that after one drug vial <b>60</b> is prepared, the contents thereof can be easily delivered to syringes <b>10</b> that are securely held in nested fashion on the rotary dial <b>130</b>. As previously mentioned, drug vials <b>60</b> are stored typically in the storage cabinet <b>110</b> and can be in either liquid form or solid form. A driven member, such as a conveyor belt <b>111</b> delivers the drug vial <b>60</b> from the cabinet <b>110</b> to a first pivotable vial gripper mechanism <b>510</b> that receives the vial <b>60</b> in a horizontal position and after gripping the vial with arms or the like, the mechanism <b>510</b> pivots upright so that the vial <b>60</b> is moved a vertical position relative to the ground and is held in an upright manner.</p>
  <p num="p-0070">The mechanism <b>510</b> is designed to deliver the vial <b>60</b> to a rotatable pedestal <b>520</b> that receives the vial <b>60</b> once the grippers of the mechanism <b>510</b> are released. The vial <b>60</b> sits upright on the pedestal <b>520</b> near one edge thereof that faces the mechanism <b>510</b> and is then rotated so that the vial <b>60</b> is moved toward the other side of the pedestal <b>520</b>. As the pedestal rotates, the vial <b>60</b> is scanned and a photoimage thereof is taken and the vial <b>60</b> is identified. If the vial <b>60</b> is not the correct vial, then the vial <b>60</b> is not used and is discarded using a gripper device that can capture and remove the vial <b>60</b> from the pedestal before it is delivered to the next processing station. The central control has a database that stores all the identifying information for the vials <b>60</b> and therefore, when a dose is being prepared, the controller knows which vial (by its identifying information) is to be delivered from the cabinet <b>110</b> to the pedestal <b>520</b>. If the scanning process and other safety features does not result in a clear positive identification of the vial as compared to the stored identifying information, then the vial is automatically discarded and the controller will instruct the system to start over and retrieve a new vial.</p>
  <p num="p-0071">If the vial <b>60</b> is identified as being the correct vial, then a vial gripper device <b>530</b> moves over to the pedestal for retrieving the vial <b>60</b>. The vial gripper device <b>530</b> is configured to securely grip and carry the vial in a nested manner to the next stations as the drug is prepared for use. For example, the device <b>530</b> can include a vertical base <b>532</b> that is operatively coupled to a moveable base portion <b>534</b> that can ride within tracks to permit the device <b>530</b> to move not only in forward-rearward directions but also in a side-to-side manner. At a distal end of the vertical base <b>532</b>, a gripper unit <b>540</b> is provided and is operatively coupled to the vertical base <b>532</b> so that the gripper unit <b>540</b> can move in an up-and-down direction. For example, the gripper unit <b>540</b> can be pneumatically supported on the vertical base <b>532</b> so that activation of the pneumatic mechanism causes either up or down movement of the gripper unit <b>540</b> relative to the vertical base <b>532</b>. The gripper unit <b>540</b> includes a pair of grippers or arms <b>542</b> that are positionable between closed and open positions with the vial <b>60</b> being captured between the arms <b>542</b> in the closed position in such a manner that the vial <b>60</b> can be securely moved and even inverted and shaken without concern that the vial <b>60</b> will become dislodged and fall from the arms <b>542</b>. The arms <b>542</b> thus have a complementary shape as the vial <b>60</b> so that when the arms <b>542</b> close, they engage the vial and nest around a portion (e.g., neck portion) of the vial <b>60</b> resulting in the vial <b>60</b> being securely captured between the arms <b>542</b>. As with some of the other components, the arms <b>542</b> can be pneumatically operated arms.</p>
  <p num="p-0072">In order to retrieve the vial <b>60</b> from the pedestal <b>520</b>, the device <b>530</b> is driven forward and then to one side so that it is position proximate the pedestal <b>520</b>. The gripper unit <b>540</b> is then moved downward so that the arms <b>542</b>, in their open position, are spaced apart with the vial <b>60</b> being located between the open arms <b>542</b>. The gripper unit <b>540</b> is then actuated so that the arms <b>542</b> close and capture the vial <b>60</b> between the arms <b>542</b>. Next the gripper unit <b>540</b> is moved upward and the device <b>530</b> is driven back to the opposite side so as to introduce the vial <b>60</b> to the next station. The vial <b>60</b> is also inverted by inversion of the gripper unit <b>540</b> so that the vial <b>60</b> is disposed upside down.</p>
  <p num="p-0073">The inverted vial <b>60</b> is then delivered to a station <b>550</b> where the vial <b>60</b> is prepared by removing the safety cap from vial <b>60</b>. This station <b>550</b> can therefore be called a vial decapper station. Any number of devices can be used at station <b>550</b> to remove the safety cap from the vial. For example, several exemplary decapper devices are disclosed in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,604,903 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. After the vial <b>60</b> is decapped, the vial is then delivered, still in the inverted position, to a cleaning station <b>560</b> where the exposed end of the vial is cleaned. For example, underneath the removed vial safety cap, there is a septum that can be pierced to gain access to the contents of the vial. The cleaning station <b>560</b> can be in the form of a swab station that has a wick saturated with a cleaning solution, such as an alcohol. The exposed area of the vial <b>60</b> is cleaned by making several passes over the saturated wick which contacts and baths the exposed area with cleaning solution. After the vial <b>60</b> is cleaned at the station <b>560</b>, the gripper unit <b>540</b> rotates so that the vial <b>60</b> is returned to its upright position and remains held between the gripper arms <b>542</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0074">The device <b>530</b> then advances forward to a fluid transfer station <b>570</b>. The fluid transfer station <b>570</b> is an automated station where the medication (drug) can be processed so that it is in a proper form for injection into one of the syringes <b>10</b> that is coupled to the rotary dial <b>130</b>. When the vial <b>60</b> contains only a solid medication and it is necessary for a diluent (e.g., water or other fluid) to be added to liquify the solid, this process is called a reconstitution process. Alternatively and as will be described in detail below, the medication can already be prepared and therefore, in this embodiment, the fluid transfer station is a station where a precise amount of medication is simply aspirated or withdrawn from the vial <b>60</b> and delivered to the syringe <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0075">For purpose of illustration, the reconstitution process is first described. After having been cleaned, the vial <b>60</b> containing a prescribed amount of solid medication is delivered in the upright position to the fluid transfer station <b>570</b> by the device <b>530</b> as shown in FIG. <b>14</b>. As will be appreciated, the device <b>530</b> has a wide range of movements in the x, y and z directions and therefore, the vial <b>60</b> can easily be moved to a set fluid transfer position. At this position, the vial <b>60</b> remains upright and a fluid transfer device <b>580</b> is brought into position relative to the vial <b>60</b> so that a fluid transfer can result therebetween. More specifically, the fluid transfer device <b>580</b> is the main means for both discharging a precise amount of diluent into the vial <b>60</b> to reconstitute the medication and also for aspirating or withdrawing the reconstituted medication from the vial <b>60</b> in a precise, prescribed amount. The device <b>580</b> is a controllable device that is operatively connected to a control unit, such as a computer, which drives the device <b>580</b> to specific locations at selected times. The control unit can be a personal computer that runs one or more programs to ensure the coordinated operation of all of the components of the system <b>100</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0076">As illustrated in FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>9</b>-<b>20</b>, one exemplary fluid transfer device <b>580</b> includes a vertical base section <b>582</b> that is rotatably mounted to a base <b>584</b> so that the device <b>580</b> can rotate between the fluid transfer position to the rotary device <b>130</b> where the medication is discharged into the syringes <b>10</b>. The base <b>584</b> can be mounted so that it can move in both the x and y directions. Near a distal end of the base <b>584</b>, a rotatable cannula unit <b>590</b> is operatively and rotatably coupled to the base <b>584</b> to permit the cannula unit <b>590</b> a degree of rotation relative to the base <b>584</b>. For example, the cannula unit <b>590</b> can include a vertical housing <b>592</b> that is rotatably coupled to the base <b>584</b> between the ends thereof. At an upper end <b>594</b> of the housing <b>592</b>, a cannula housing <b>600</b> is operatively coupled thereto such that the cannula housing <b>600</b> can be independently moved in a controlled up and down manner so to either lower it or raise it relative to the vial <b>60</b> in the fluid transfer position. For example, the cannula housing <b>600</b> can be pneumatically operated and therefore can includes a plurality of shafts <b>602</b> which support the cannula housing <b>600</b> and extend into an interior of the vertical housing <b>592</b> such that when the device is pneumatically operated, the shafts <b>602</b> can be driven either out of or into the housing <b>592</b> resulting in the cannula housing <b>600</b> either being raised or lowered, respectively, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0077">At one end of the cannula housing <b>600</b> opposite the end that is coupled to the vertical housing <b>592</b>, the cannula housing <b>600</b> includes a cannula <b>610</b>. The cannula <b>610</b> has one end <b>612</b> that serves to pierce the septum of the vial <b>60</b> and an opposite end <b>614</b> that is connected to a main conduit <b>620</b> that serves to both deliver diluent to the cannula <b>610</b> and ultimately to the vial <b>60</b> and receive aspirated medication from the vial <b>60</b>. Preferably, the cannula <b>610</b> is of the type that is known as a vented cannula which is vented to atmosphere as a means for eliminating any dripping or spattering of the medication during an aspiration process. More specifically, the use of a vented needle to add (and withdraw) the fluid to the vial overcomes a number of shortcoming associated with cannula fluid transfer and in particular, the use of this type of needle prevents backpressure in the vial (which can result in blow out or spitting or spraying of the fluid through the piercing hole of the cannula). The venting takes place via an atmospheric vent that is located in a clean air space and is formed in a specially designed hub that is disposed over the needle. By varying the depth that the needle penetrates the vial, the user can control whether the vent is activated or not. It will be appreciated that the venting action is a form of drip control (spitting) that may otherwise take place.</p>
  <p num="p-0078">Moreover, the cannula <b>610</b> is also preferably of the type that is motorized so that the tip of the cannula <b>610</b> can move around within the vial <b>60</b> so that cannula <b>610</b> can locate and aspirate every last drop of the medication. In other words, the cannula <b>610</b> itself is mounted within the cannula unit <b>590</b> so that it can move slightly therein such that the tip moves within the vial and can be brought into contact with the medication wherever the medication may lie within the vial <b>60</b>. Thus, the cannula <b>610</b> is driven so that it can be moved at least laterally within the vial <b>60</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0079">An opposite end of the main conduit <b>620</b> is connected to a fluid pump system <b>630</b> that provides the means for creating a negative pressure in the main conduit <b>620</b> to cause a precise amount of fluid to be withdrawn into the cannula <b>610</b> and the main conduit <b>620</b> as well as creating a positive pressure in the main conduit <b>620</b> to discharge the fluid (either diluent or medication) that is stored in the main conduit <b>620</b> proximate the cannula <b>610</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the fluid pump system <b>630</b> includes a first syringe <b>632</b> and a second syringe <b>634</b>, each of which has a plunger or the like <b>638</b> which serves to draw fluid into the syringe or expel fluid therefrom. The main difference between the first and second syringes <b>632</b>, <b>634</b> is that the amount of fluid that each can hold. In other words, the first syringe <b>632</b> has a larger diameter barrel and therefore has increased holding capacity relative to the second syringe <b>634</b>. As will be described in detail below, the first syringe <b>632</b> is intended to receive and discharge larger volumes of fluid, while the second syringe <b>634</b> performs more of a fine tuning operation in that it precisely can receive and discharge small volumes of fluid.</p>
  <p num="p-0080">The syringes <b>632</b>, <b>634</b> are typically mounted so that an open end <b>636</b> thereof is the uppermost portion of the syringe and the plunger <b>638</b> is disposed so that it is the lowermost portion of the syringe. Each of the syringes <b>632</b>, <b>634</b> is operatively connected to a syringe driver, generally indicated at <b>640</b>, which serves to precisely control the movement of the plunger <b>638</b> and thus precisely controls the amount (volume) of fluid that is either received or discharged therefrom. More specifically, the driver <b>640</b> is mechanically linked to the plunger <b>638</b> so that controlled actuation thereof causes precise movements of the plunger <b>638</b> relative to the barrel of the syringe. In one embodiment, the driver <b>640</b> is a stepper motor that can precisely control the distance that the plunger <b>638</b> is extended or retracted, which in turn corresponds to a precise volume of fluid being aspirated or discharged. Thus, each syringe <b>632</b>, <b>634</b> has its own driver <b>640</b> so that the corresponding plunger <b>638</b> thereof can be precisely controlled and this permits the larger syringe <b>632</b> to handle large volumes of fluid, while the smaller syringe <b>634</b> handles smaller volumes of fluid. As is known, stepper motors can be controlled with a great degree of precision so that the stepper motor can be only be driven a small number of steps which corresponds to the plunger <b>638</b> being moves a very small distance. On the other hand, the stepper motor can be driven a large number of steps which results in the plunger <b>638</b> being moved a much greater distance. The drivers <b>640</b> are preferably a part of a larger automated system that is in communication with a master controller that serves to monitor and control the operation of the various components. For example, the master controller calculates the amount of fluid that is to be either discharged from or aspirated into the cannula <b>610</b> and the main conduit <b>620</b> and then determines the volume ratio as to how much fluid is to be associated with the first syringe <b>632</b> and how much fluid is to be associated with the second syringe <b>634</b>. Based on these calculations and determinations, the controller instructs the drivers <b>640</b> to operate in a prescribed manner to ensure that the precise amount of volume of fluid is either discharged or aspirated into the main conduit <b>620</b> through the cannula <b>610</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0081">The open end <b>636</b> of each syringe <b>632</b>, <b>634</b> includes one or more connectors to fluidly couple the syringe <b>632</b>, <b>634</b> with a source <b>650</b> of diluent and with the main conduit <b>620</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the first syringe <b>632</b> includes a first T connector <b>660</b> that is coupled to the open end <b>636</b> and the second syringe <b>634</b> includes a second T connector <b>662</b> that is coupled to the open end <b>636</b> thereof. Each of the legs of the T connectors <b>660</b>, <b>662</b> has an internal valve mechanism or the like <b>670</b> that is associated therewith so that each leg as well as the main body that leads to the syringe itself can either be open or closed and this action and setting is independent from the action at the other two conduit members of the connector. In other words and according to one preferred arrangement, the valve <b>670</b> is an internal valve assembly contained within the T connector body itself such that there is a separate valve element for each leg as well as a separate valve element for the main body. It will be appreciated that each of the legs and the main body defines a conduit section and therefore, it is desirable to be able to selectively permit or prevent flow of fluid in a particular conduit section.</p>
  <p num="p-0082">In the illustrated embodiment, a first leg <b>661</b> of the first T connector <b>660</b> is connected to a first conduit <b>656</b> that is connected at its other end to the diluent source <b>650</b> and the second leg <b>663</b> of the first T connector <b>660</b> is connected to a connector conduit (tubing) <b>652</b> that is connected at its other end to the first leg of the second T connector <b>662</b> associated with the second syringe <b>634</b>. A main body <b>665</b> of the first T connector <b>660</b> is mated with the open end <b>636</b> of the first syringe <b>632</b> and defines a flow path thereto. The connector conduit <b>652</b> thus serves to fluidly connect the first and second syringes <b>632</b>, <b>634</b>. As previously mentioned, the valve mechanism <b>670</b> is preferably of the type that includes three independently operable valve elements with one associated with one leg <b>661</b>, one associated with the other leg <b>663</b> and one associated with the main body <b>665</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0083">With respect to the second T connector <b>662</b>, a first leg <b>667</b> is connected to the connector conduit <b>652</b> and a second leg <b>669</b> is connected to a second conduit <b>658</b> that is connected to the main conduit <b>620</b> or can actually be simply one end of the main conduit. A main body <b>671</b> of the second T connector <b>662</b> is mated with the open end <b>636</b> of the second syringe <b>634</b>. As with the first T connector <b>660</b>, the second T connector <b>662</b> includes an internal valve mechanism <b>670</b> that is preferably of the type that includes three independently operable valve elements with one associated with one leg <b>667</b>, one associated with the other leg <b>669</b> and one associated with the main body <b>671</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0084">The operation of the fluid pump system <b>630</b> is now described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-13</figref>. If the operation to be performed is a reconstitution operation, the valve <b>670</b> associated with the second leg <b>669</b> is first closed so that the communication between the syringes and the main conduit <b>620</b> is restricted. The valve element <b>670</b> associated with first leg <b>661</b> of the T connector <b>660</b> is left open so that a prescribed amount of diluent can be received from the source <b>650</b>. The valve element associated with the second leg <b>663</b> of the T connector <b>660</b> is initially closed so that the diluent from the diluent source <b>650</b> is initially drawn into the first syringe <b>630</b> and the valve element associated with the main body <b>665</b> is left open so that the diluent can flow into the first syringe <b>632</b>. The driver <b>640</b> associated with the first syringe <b>632</b> is then actuated for a prescribed period of time resulting in the plunger <b>638</b> thereof being extended a prescribed distance. As previously mentioned, the distance that the driver <b>640</b> moves the corresponding plunger <b>638</b> is directly tied to the amount of fluid that is to be received within the syringe <b>632</b>. The extension of the plunger <b>638</b> creates negative pressure in the first syringe <b>632</b>, thereby causing diluent to be drawn therein. This is shown in FIG. <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0085">Once the prescribed amount of fluid is received in the first syringe <b>632</b>, the valve element associated with the main body <b>665</b> of the T connector <b>660</b> is closed and the valve element associated with the second leg <b>663</b> is open, thereby permitting flow from the first T connector <b>660</b> to the second T connector <b>662</b> as shown in FIG. <b>11</b>. At the same time, the valve element associated with the first leg <b>667</b> and the main body <b>671</b> of the second T connector <b>662</b> are opened (with the valve element associated with the second leg <b>669</b> being kept closed).</p>
  <p num="p-0086">The driver <b>640</b> associated with the second syringe <b>634</b> is then actuated for a prescribed period of time resulting in the plunger <b>638</b> thereof being extended a prescribed distance which results in a precise, prescribed amount of fluid being drawn into the second syringe <b>634</b>. The extension of the plunger <b>638</b> creates negative pressure within the barrel of the second syringe <b>634</b> and since the second T connector <b>662</b> is in fluid communication with the diluent source <b>650</b> through the first T connector <b>660</b> and the connector conduit <b>652</b>, diluent can be drawn directly into the second syringe <b>632</b>. The diluent is not drawn into the first syringe <b>660</b> since the valve element associated with the main body <b>665</b> of the first T connector <b>660</b> is closed.</p>
  <p num="p-0087">Thus, at this time, the first and second syringes <b>632</b>, <b>634</b> hold in total at least a prescribed volume of diluent that corresponds to at least the precise volume that is to be discharged through the cannula <b>610</b> into the vial <b>60</b> to reconstitute the medication contained therein.</p>
  <p num="p-0088">It will be understood that all of the conduits, including those leading from the source <b>650</b> and to the cannula are fully primed with diluent prior to performing any of the above operations.</p>
  <p num="p-0089">To discharge the prescribed volume of diluent into the vial, the process is essentially reversed with the valve <b>670</b> associated with the first leg <b>661</b> of the T connector <b>660</b> is closed to prevent flow through the first conduit <b>656</b> from the diluent source <b>650</b>. The valve element associated with the second leg <b>669</b> of the second T connector <b>662</b> is opened to permit fluid flow therethrough and into the second conduit <b>658</b> to the cannula <b>610</b>. The diluent that is stored in the first and second syringes <b>632</b>, <b>634</b> can be delivered to the second conduit <b>658</b> in a prescribed volume according to any number of different methods, including discharging the diluent from one of the syringes <b>632</b>, <b>634</b> or discharging the diluent from both of the syringes <b>634</b>. For purpose of illustration only, it is described that the diluent is drawn from both of the syringes <b>632</b>, <b>634</b>. This arrangement is shown in FIG. <b>12</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0090">The diluent contained in the first syringe <b>632</b> can be introduced into the main conduit <b>620</b> by opening the valve associated with the second leg <b>663</b> and the main body <b>665</b> of the first T connector <b>660</b> as well as opening up the valve element associated with the first leg <b>667</b> of the second T connector <b>662</b>, while the valve element associated with the main body <b>671</b> of the second T connector <b>662</b> remains closed. The valve element associated with the second leg <b>669</b> remains open. The driver <b>640</b> associated with the first syringe <b>632</b> is operated to retract the plunger <b>638</b> causing a positive pressure to be exerted and resulting in a volume of the stored diluent being discharged from the first syringe <b>632</b> into the connector conduit <b>652</b> and ultimately to the second conduit <b>658</b> which is in direct fluid communication with the cannula <b>610</b>. The entire volume of diluent that is needed for the reconstitution can be taken from the first syringe <b>632</b> or else a portion of the diluent is taken therefrom with an additional amount (fine tuning) to be taken from the second syringe <b>634</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0091">When it is desired to withdraw diluent from the second syringe <b>634</b>, the valve associated with the first leg <b>667</b> of the second T connector <b>662</b> is closed (thereby preventing fluid communication between the syringes <b>632</b>, <b>634</b>) and the valve associated with the main body <b>671</b> of the second T connector <b>662</b> is opened as shown in FIG. <b>13</b>. The driver <b>640</b> associated with the second syringe <b>634</b> is then instructed to retract the plunger <b>638</b> causing a positive pressure to be exerted and resulting in the stored diluent being discharged from the second syringe <b>634</b> into the second conduit <b>658</b>. Since the second conduit <b>658</b> and the main conduit <b>620</b> are fully primed, any new volume of diluent that is added to the second conduit <b>658</b> by one or both of the first and second syringes <b>632</b>, <b>634</b> is discharged at the other end of the main conduit <b>620</b>. The net result is that the prescribed amount of diluent that is needed to properly reconstitute the medication is delivered through the cannula <b>610</b> and into the vial <b>60</b>. These processing steps are generally shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-16</figref> in which the cannula <b>610</b> pierces the septum of the vial and then delivers the diluent to the vial and then the cannula unit <b>590</b> and the vial gripper device <b>530</b> are inverted to cause agitation and mixing of the contents of the vial.</p>
  <p num="p-0092">It will be understood that in some applications, only one of the first and second syringes <b>632</b>, <b>634</b> may be needed to operate to first receive diluent from the diluent source <b>650</b> and then discharge the diluent into the main conduit <b>610</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0093">After the medication in the vial <b>60</b> has been reconstituted as by inversion of the vial and mixing, as described herein, the fluid pump system <b>630</b> is then operated so that a prescribed amount of medication is aspirated or otherwise drawn from the vial <b>60</b> through the cannula <b>610</b> and into the main conduit <b>620</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-20</figref>. Before the fluid is aspirated into the main conduit <b>620</b>, an air bubble is introduced into the main conduit <b>620</b> to serve as a buffer between the diluent contained in the conduit <b>620</b> to be discharged into one vial and the aspirated medication that is to be delivered and discharged into one syringe <b>10</b>. It will be appreciated that the two fluids (diluent and prepared medication) can not be allowed to mix together in the conduit <b>620</b>. The air bubble serves as an air cap in the tubing of the cannula and serves as an air block used between the fluid in the line (diluent) and the pulled medication. According to one exemplary embodiment, the air block is a {fraction (1/10)} ml air block; however, this volume is merely exemplary and the size of the air block can be varied.</p>
  <p num="p-0094">The aspiration operation is essentially the opposite of the above operation where the diluent is discharged into the vial <b>60</b>. More specifically, the valve <b>670</b> associated with the first leg <b>661</b> of the first T connector <b>660</b> is closed and the valve associated with the second leg <b>669</b> of the second T connector <b>662</b> is opened to permit flow of the diluent in the main conduit into one or both of the syringes <b>632</b>, <b>634</b>. As previously mentioned, the second syringe <b>634</b> acts more as a means to fine tune the volume of the fluid that is either to be discharged or aspirated.</p>
  <p num="p-0095">The drivers <b>640</b> associated with one or both of the first and second syringes <b>632</b>, <b>634</b> are actuated for a prescribed period of time resulting in the plungers <b>638</b> thereof being extended a prescribed distance (which can be different from one another). As previously mentioned, the distance that the drivers <b>640</b> move the corresponding plungers <b>638</b> is directly tied to the volume of fluid that is to be received within the corresponding syringe <b>632</b>, <b>634</b>. By extending one or both of the plungers <b>638</b> by means of the drivers <b>640</b>, a negative pressure is created in the main conduit <b>620</b> as fluid is drawn into one or both of the syringes <b>632</b>, <b>634</b>. The creation of negative pressure within the main conduit <b>620</b> and the presence of the tip end of the cannula <b>610</b> within the medication translates into the medication being drawn into the cannula <b>610</b> and ultimately into the main conduit <b>620</b> with the air block being present therein to separate the pulled medication and the fluid in the line.</p>
  <p num="p-0096">It will be appreciated that the aspiration process can be conducted so that fluid is aspirated into one of the syringes <b>632</b>, <b>634</b> first and then later an additional amount of fluid can be aspirated into the other syringe <b>632</b>, <b>634</b> by simply controlling whether the valves in the main bodies <b>665</b>, <b>671</b> are open or closed. For example, if fluid is to be aspirated solely to the first syringe <b>632</b>, then the valve elements associated with the first and second legs <b>667</b>, <b>669</b> of the second T connector <b>662</b> and the valve element associated with the second leg <b>663</b> and main body <b>665</b> of the first T connector <b>660</b> are all open, while the valve elements associated with the first leg <b>661</b> of the T connector <b>660</b> and the main body <b>671</b> of the T connector <b>662</b> remain closed. After a sufficient volume of fluid has been aspirated into the first syringe <b>632</b> and it is desired to aspirate more fluid into the second syringe <b>634</b>, then the valve element associated with the first leg <b>667</b> simply needs to be closed and then the driver <b>640</b> of the second syringe <b>634</b> is actuated to extend the plunger <b>638</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0097">After aspirating the medication into the main conduit <b>620</b>, the fluid transfer device <b>580</b> is rotated as is described below to position the cannula <b>610</b> relative to one syringe <b>10</b> that is nested within the rotary dial <b>130</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>. Since the plungers <b>638</b> are pulled a prescribed distance that directly translates into a predetermined amount of medication being drawn into the main conduit <b>620</b>, the plungers <b>638</b> are simply retracted (moved in the opposite direction) the same distance which results in a positive pressure being exerted on the fluid within the main conduit <b>620</b> and this causes the pulled medication to be discharged through the cannula <b>610</b> and into the syringe <b>10</b>. During the aspiration operation and the subsequent discharge of the fluid, the valves are maintained at set positions so that the fluid can be discharged from the first and second syringes <b>632</b>, <b>634</b>. As the plungers <b>638</b> are retracted and the pulled medication is discharged, the air block continuously moves within the main conduit <b>620</b> toward the cannula <b>610</b>. When all of the pulled (aspirated) medication is discharged, the air block is positioned at the end of the main conduit signifying that the complete pulled medication dose has been discharged; however, none of the diluent that is stored within the main conduit <b>620</b> is discharged into the syringe <b>10</b> since the fluid transfer device <b>580</b>, and more particularly, the drivers <b>640</b> thereof, operates with such precision that only the prescribed medication that has been previously pulled into the main conduit <b>620</b> is discharged into the vial <b>60</b>. The valve elements can be arranged so that the plungers can be retracted one at a time with only one valve element associated with the main bodies <b>665</b>, <b>671</b> being open or the plungers can be operated at the same time.</p>
  <p num="p-0098">It will be appreciated that the fluid transfer device <b>580</b> may need to make several aspirations and discharges of the medication into the vial <b>60</b> in order to inject the complete prescribed medication dosage into the vial <b>60</b>. In other words, the cannula unit <b>590</b> can operate to first aspirate a prescribed amount of fluid into the main conduit <b>620</b> and then is operated so that it rotates over to and above one syringe <b>10</b> on the rotary dial <b>130</b>, where one incremental dose amount is discharged into the vial <b>60</b>. After the first incremental dose amount is completely discharged into the syringe <b>10</b>, the vertical base section <b>582</b> is rotated so that the cannula unit <b>590</b> is brought back the fluid transfer position where the fluid transfer device <b>582</b> is operated so that a second incremental dose amount is aspirated into the main conduit <b>620</b> in the manner described in detail hereinbefore. The vertical base section <b>582</b> is then rotated again so that the cannula unit <b>590</b> is brought back to the rotary dial <b>130</b> above the syringe <b>10</b> that contains the first incremental dose amount of medication. The cannula <b>610</b> is then lowered so that the cannula tip is placed within the interior of the syringe <b>10</b> and the cannula unit <b>590</b> (drivers <b>640</b>) is operated so that the second incremental dose amount is discharged into the syringe <b>10</b>. The process is repeated until the complete medication dose is transferred into the syringe <b>10</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0099">In yet another embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the two syringes <b>632</b>, <b>634</b> are not directly connected to one another but instead each of the syringes <b>632</b>, <b>634</b> is directly fluidly connected to the diluent source <b>550</b> and the main conduit <b>620</b>. More specifically, one leg of the T connector <b>660</b> of the first syringe <b>632</b> is coupled to a first conduit <b>656</b> that is connected at its other end to the diluent source <b>650</b> and the other leg of the connector <b>660</b> is coupled to a second conduit <b>658</b> that is connected at its other end to the main conduit <b>620</b>. Similarly, one leg of the T connector <b>662</b> of the second syringe <b>634</b> is coupled to a first conduit <b>656</b> that is connected at its other end to the diluent source <b>650</b> and the other leg of the connector <b>662</b> is coupled to a second conduit <b>658</b> that is connected at its other end to the main conduit <b>620</b>. In this manner, when it is desired to draw diluent from the diluent source <b>650</b>, the respective drivers <b>640</b> are operated to cause the respective plungers <b>638</b> to be independently extended and depending upon the distance that each is extended, a prescribed volume of diluent is drawn into the syringe. At this time, the valves <b>670</b> that are associated with the first conduits <b>658</b> are open, while those associated with the second conduits <b>658</b> are clsoed. As mentioned, the first syringe <b>632</b> typically draws a greater volume of diluent since the second syringe <b>634</b> is designed to fine tune and provide small increments of diluent to be added to the vial. Similarly, when an aspiration process is performed, the two valves associated with the first conduits <b>656</b> are closed and when the drivers <b>640</b> are operated to discharge or pump the aspirated medication, the valves <b>670</b> associated with the first conduits <b>656</b> remain closed.</p>
  <p num="p-0100">Once the syringe <b>10</b> receives the complete prescribed medication dose, the vial <b>60</b> that is positioned at the fluid transfer position can either be (1) discarded or (2) it can be delivered to a holding station <b>700</b> where it is cataloged and held for additional future use. More specifically, the holding station <b>700</b> serves as a parking location where a vial that is not completely used can be used later in the preparation of a downstream syringe <b>10</b>. In other words, the vials <b>60</b> that are stored at the holding station <b>700</b> are labeled as multi-use medications that can be reused. These multi-use vials <b>60</b> are fully reconstituted so that at the time of the next use, the medication is only aspirated from the vials <b>60</b> as opposed to having to first inject diluent to reconstitute the medication. The user can easily input into the database of the master controller which medications are multi-use medications and thus when the vial <b>60</b> is scanned and identified prior to being delivered to the fluid transfer position, the vial <b>60</b> is identified and marked as a multi-use medication and thus, once the entire medication dose transfer has been performed, the vial gripper device <b>530</b> is instructed to deliver the vial <b>60</b> to the holding station <b>700</b>. Typically, multi-use medications are those medications that are more expensive than other medications and also are those medications that are used in larger volumes (quantities) or are stored in larger containers and therefore come in large volumes.</p>
  <p num="p-0101">The holding station <b>700</b> is simply a location where the multi-use vials can be easily stored. For example, the holding station <b>700</b> is preferably a shelf or even a cabinet that contains a flat surface for placing the vials <b>60</b>. Preferably, there is a means for categorizing and inventorying the vials <b>60</b> that are placed at the holding station <b>700</b>. For example, a grid with distinct coordinates can be created to make it easy to determine where each vial <b>60</b> is stored within the holding station <b>700</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0102">Once the device <b>530</b> has positioned the gripper unit <b>540</b> at the proper location of the holding station <b>700</b>, the gripper unit <b>540</b> is operated so that the arms thereof release the vial <b>60</b> at the proper location. The device <b>530</b> then returns back to its default position where it can then next be instructed to retrieve a new vial <b>60</b> from the pedestal <b>520</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0103">If the vial <b>60</b> is not a multi-use medication, then the vial <b>60</b> at the fluid transfer position is discarded. When this occurs, the device <b>530</b> moves such that the vial <b>60</b> is positioned over a waste chute or receptacle and then the gripper unit <b>540</b> is actuated to cause the vial <b>60</b> to drop therefrom into the waste chute or receptacle. The device <b>530</b> then is ready to go and retrieve a new vial <b>60</b> that is positioned at the pedestal <b>520</b> for purposes of either reconstituting the medication or simply aspirating an amount of medication therefrom or a vial from the holding station <b>700</b> can be retrieved.</p>
  <p num="p-0104">As previously mentioned, during the reconstitution process, it is often necessary or preferable to mix the medication beyond the mere inversion of the vial and therefore, the vial <b>60</b> can be further agitated using a mixing device or the like <b>710</b>. In one embodiment, the mixing device <b>710</b> is a vortex type mixer that has a top surface on which the vial <b>60</b> is placed and then upon actuation of the mixer, the vial <b>60</b> is vibrated or otherwise shaken to cause all of the solid medication to go into solution or cause the medication to be otherwise mixed. In yet another embodiment, the mixing device is a mechanical shaker device, such as those that are used to hold and shake paint cans. For example, the vial <b>60</b> can be placed on support surface of the shaker and then an adjustable hold down bar is manipulated so that it travels towards the vial and engages the vial at an end opposite the support surface. Once the vial <b>60</b> is securely captured between these two members, the shaker device is actuated resulting in the vial <b>60</b> being shaken to agitate the medication and ensure that all of the medication properly goes into solution. This type of mixing device can also be configured so that it is in the form of a robotic arm that holds the vial by means of gripper members (fingers) and is operatively connected to a motor or the like which serves to rapidly move the arm in a back and forth manner to cause mixing of the medication.</p>
  <p num="p-0105">As briefly mentioned before, the entire system <b>100</b> is integrated and automated and also utilizes a database for storing identifying data, mixing instructions, and other information to assist in the preparation of the medication. There are also a number of safety features and check locations to make sure that the medication preparation is proceeding as it should.</p>
  <p num="p-0106">For example, the database includes identifying information so that each vial <b>60</b> and syringe <b>10</b> can be carefully kept track of during each step of the process. For example, a scanner <b>720</b> and the photoimaging equipment serve to positively identify the vial <b>60</b> that is delivered from the drug storage <b>110</b>. Typically, the user will enter one or more medication preparation orders where the system <b>100</b> is instructed to prepare one or more syringes that contain specific medication. Based on this entered information or on a stored medication preparation order that is retrieved from a database, the vial master controller determines at which location in the cabinet the correct vial <b>60</b> is located. That vial <b>60</b> is then removed using a robotic gripper device (not shown) and is then placed on the conveyor belt <b>111</b> and delivered to the mechanism <b>510</b> pivots upright so that the vial <b>60</b> is moved a vertical position relative to the ground and is held in an upright manner and is then delivered to the rotatable pedestal <b>520</b>. At the pedestal <b>520</b>, the vial <b>60</b> is scanned to attempt to positively identify the vial <b>60</b> and if the scanned identifying information matches the stored information, the vial <b>60</b> is permitted to proceed to the next station. Otherwise, the vial <b>60</b> is discarded.</p>
  <p num="p-0107">Once the vial <b>60</b> is confirmed to be the right vial it proceeds to the fluid transfer position. The master controller serves to precisely calculate how the fluid transfer operation is to be performed and then monitors the fluid transfer operations has it is occurring. More specifically, the master controller first determines the steps necessary to undertake in order to perform the reconstitution operation. Most often during a reconstitution operation, the vial <b>60</b> that is retrieved from the drug storage <b>110</b> contains a certain amount of medication in the solid form. In order to properly reconstitute the medication, it is necessary to know what the desired concentration of the resulting medication is to be since this determines how much diluent is to be added to the vial <b>60</b>. Thus, one piece of information that the user is initially asked to enter is the concentration of the medication that is to be delivered to the patient as well as the amount that is to be delivered. Based on the desired concentration of the medication, the master controller is able to calculate how much diluent is to be added to the solid medication in the vial <b>60</b> to fully reconstitute the medication. Moreover, the database also preferably includes instructions as to the mixing process in that the mixing device is linked to and is in communication with the master controller so that the time that the mixing device is operated is stored in the database such that once the user inputs the medication that is to be prepared and once the vial <b>60</b> is scanned and identified, the system (master controller or CPU thereof) determines the correct of time that the vial <b>60</b> is to be shaken to ensure that all of the medication goes into solution.</p>
  <p num="p-0108">Once the master controller determines and instructs the working components on how the reconstitution operation should proceed, the master controller also calculates and prepares instructions on how many distinct fluid transfers are necessary to deliver the prescribed amount of medication from the vial <b>60</b> to the syringe <b>10</b>. In other words, the cannula unit <b>590</b> may not be able to fully aspirate the total amount of medication from the vial <b>60</b> in one operation and therefore, the master controller determines how many transfer are needed and also the appropriate volume of each aspiration so that the sum of the aspiration amounts is equal to the amount of medication that is to be delivered to the syringe <b>10</b>. Thus when multiple aspiration/discharge steps are required, the master controller instructs and controls the operation of the drivers <b>640</b> so that the precise amounts of medication are aspirated and then discharged into the syringe <b>10</b>. As previously described, the syringe drivers <b>640</b> retract and advance at the right levels to cause the proper dose amount of the medication to be first aspirated from the vial and then discharged into the syringe. This process is repeated as necessary until the correct dose amount is present in the syringe <b>10</b> in accordance with the initial inputted instructions of the user.</p>
  <p num="p-0109">After transferring the proper precise amount of medication to one syringe <b>10</b>, the master controller instructs the rotary dial to move forward in an indexed manner so that the next empty syringe <b>10</b> is brought into the fluid transfer position. The cannula <b>610</b> is also preferably cleaned after each medication dose transfer is completed so as to permit the cannula <b>610</b> to be reused. There are a number of different techniques that can be used to clean the cannula <b>610</b> between each medication transfer operation. For example, the cleaning equipment and techniques described in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,616,771 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/457,898 (both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties) are both suitable for use in the cleaning of the cannula <b>610</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0110">In one embodiment, the cannula <b>610</b> is rotated and positioned so that the needle of the cannula <b>610</b> is lowered into a bath so that fluid is expelled between the inside hubs of the syringe <b>10</b> for cleaning of the interior components of the cannula <b>610</b>. The cannula <b>610</b> is then preferably dipped into a bath or reservoir to clean the outside of the cannula <b>610</b>. In this manner, the cannula <b>610</b> can be fully cleaned and ready for a next use without the need for replacement of the cannula <b>610</b>, which can be quite a costly endeavor.</p>
  <p num="p-0111">In yet another embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-24</figref>, a medication source <b>730</b>, such as a bag that is filled with liquid medication that has already been properly reconstituted, is connected to an input portion of a peristaltic pump <b>732</b> by means of a first conduit section <b>740</b>. A second conduit section <b>742</b> is connected to an output port of the pump <b>732</b> and terminates in a connector <b>744</b>. The connector <b>744</b> is of the type that is configured to hermetically seal with an open barrel tip of the syringe <b>10</b> that is nested within the rotary dial <b>130</b> and is marked to receive medication. The connector <b>744</b> typically includes a conduit member <b>745</b> (tubing) that is surrounded by a skirt member or the like <b>747</b> that mates with the outer hub of the syringe barrel. A flange or diaphragm <b>749</b> can be provided as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> for hermetically sealing with the syringe barrel (outer hub).</p>
  <p num="p-0112">In commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/457,066 (which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety), it is described how the plunger <b>50</b> of the syringe <b>10</b> can be extended with precision to a prescribed distance. In that application, the plunger <b>50</b> is extended to create a precise volume in the barrel that is to receive the medication that is injected therein at a downstream location. However, it will be appreciated that the action of extending the plunger <b>50</b> can serve more than this purpose since the extension of the plunger <b>50</b> creates negative pressure within the syringe barrel and thus can serve to draw a fluid therein. For example, once the connector <b>744</b> is sealingly mated with the open syringe tip end, the medication source <b>730</b> is fluidly connected to the syringe <b>10</b> and thus can be drawn into the syringe barrel by means of the extension of the plunger <b>50</b>. In other words, the plunger <b>50</b> is pulled a precise distance that results in the correct size cavity being opened up in the barrel for receiving the fluid but also the extension of the plunger creates enough negative pressure to cause the medication to be drawn into the syringe barrel. This is thus an alternative means for withdrawing the proper amount of medication from a member (in this case the source <b>730</b>) and transferring the desired, precise amount of medication to the syringe <b>10</b>. The operation of this alternative embodiment can be referred to as operating the system in reservoir mode. One advantage of this embodiment is that multiple syringe drivers are not needed to pump the medication into the syringe <b>10</b> but rather the drawing action is created right at the rotary dial <b>130</b>. This design is thus fairly simple; however, it is not suitable for instances where drug reconstitution is necessary.</p>
  <p num="p-0113">Prior to its using another drug, the cannula <b>610</b> is cleaned using conventional techniques, such as those described in the previously incorporated patents and patent applications.</p>
  <p num="p-0114">After the medication is aspirated into the barrel <b>20</b>, the dial <b>130</b> is advanced so that the filled syringe <b>10</b> is delivered to the sixth station <b>180</b> (FIG. <b>2</b>). For example, the dial <b>130</b> is preferably advanced so that the filled syringe <b>10</b> is delivered to a station where the removed tip cap <b>40</b> is replaced back onto the barrel tip <b>28</b> by a device <b>900</b>. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</figref>, the device <b>900</b> can be similar or identical to the device <b>300</b> that removes the tip cap <b>40</b> from the barrel tip <b>28</b> at an earlier station or the device <b>900</b> can be different from the device <b>300</b> so long as the device <b>900</b> is configured to grasp the tip cap <b>40</b> from the post <b>161</b> and then place the tip cap <b>40</b> back on the barrel tip <b>28</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0115">For purpose of illustration and simplicity, the device <b>900</b> will be described as being of the same type as device <b>300</b>. The automated device <b>900</b> is a robotic device and preferably, the automated device <b>900</b> is a linear actuator with a gripper. The device <b>900</b> has a vertical base <b>910</b> which is adjustable in at least several directions. For example, the vertical base <b>910</b> has an independent reach (y axis) and vertical axis (x axis) which provides part of the flexibility and motion control that is desirable for the device <b>900</b>. The vertical base <b>910</b> has an upper end <b>912</b> and an opposing lower end <b>914</b> which is operatively coupled to other movable components to permit the vertical base <b>910</b> to move in an up/down direction along the x axis and in lateral directions along the y axis. The upper end <b>912</b> is connected to a horizontal support member <b>920</b> that extends outwardly away from the vertical base <b>910</b>. In one exemplary embodiment, the lower end <b>614</b> is disposed between two support beams that are part of a robotic device and are moved in a number of different directions, including along the x axis and the y axis.</p>
  <p num="p-0116">A block member <b>930</b> is connected to the horizontal support member <b>920</b> and more specifically, the block member <b>930</b> is disposed on an underside of the horizontal support member <b>920</b> so that it is spaced away from the vertical base <b>910</b>. The exemplary block member <b>930</b> has a block-like shape and is connected to the underside of the horizontal support member <b>920</b> by one or more connectors that can be in the form of support columns, etc.</p>
  <p num="p-0117">The device <b>900</b> has first and second positionable gripping arms <b>940</b> which are adjustable in at least one direction and which are coupled to and extend downwardly from the block member <b>930</b>. For example, each of the gripping arms <b>940</b> is movable at least in a direction along the y axis which provides the flexibility and motion control that is desirable in the present system <b>100</b>. The gripping arms <b>940</b> are programmed to work together in tandem so that both arms <b>940</b> are driven to the same location and the same time.</p>
  <p num="p-0118">The block member <b>930</b> can house some of the electronic or hydraulic components and the like that permit the gripping arms <b>940</b> to move between the open and closed positions. The coupling between the block member <b>930</b> and the gripping arms <b>940</b> is such that the gripping arms <b>940</b> have the necessary degree of movement to permit the opening and closing thereof.</p>
  <p num="p-0119">Each of the gripping arms <b>940</b> is a generally L-shaped member that is formed of a vertical section <b>942</b> and a horizontal gripping section (not shown) that extends outwardly from one end of the vertical section <b>942</b>. The gripping section has a cut-out or notch <b>360</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) formed therein for receiving and gripping a section of the barrel <b>20</b> of the syringe <b>10</b>. Accordingly, the notch has a complementary shape as the shape of the barrel <b>20</b>. One exemplary notch has a generally semi-circular shape and it seats against approximately ½ of the outer circumferential surface of the syringe barrel <b>20</b>. By being movable along at least the y axis, the gripping arms <b>940</b> can be positioned between an open position in which the opposing gripping sections of the arms <b>940</b> are spaced apart from one another a sufficient distance to permit the tip cap <b>40</b> to be received therebetween.</p>
  <p num="p-0120">In the closed position, the gripping sections of the arms <b>940</b> are brought together so that they either seat against one another or are in very close proximity to one another. When the gripping sections come together in the closed position, the notches define a complete circular opening that has a diameter about equal to or slightly less than the diameter of the base section <b>41</b> of the tip cap <b>40</b>, thereby permitting the tip cap <b>40</b> to nest within the gripping sections <b>944</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0121">In a first open position of the gripping arms <b>940</b>, the gripping sections being spaced sufficiently from one another so as to permit the tip cap <b>40</b> to be freely disposed between the gripping sections. Using a control unit <b>950</b> (e.g., a programmable actuator, microprocessor, etc.), the gripping arms <b>940</b> are driven to the first position shown in FIG. <b>14</b>. The control unit <b>950</b> instructs the device <b>900</b> to perform an operation where the tip cap <b>40</b> resting on the post <b>161</b> is gripped and removed by the device <b>900</b>. When such an operation is performed, the vertical base <b>910</b> is driven inwardly toward the dial <b>130</b> and upwardly so that the gripping arms <b>940</b> are positioned over the tip cap <b>40</b> that is disposed on top of the post <b>161</b>. The vertical base <b>910</b> is then driven downward until the gripping arms <b>940</b> are disposed around the tip cap <b>40</b>. In other words, the tip cap <b>40</b> is disposed between the gripping section of the opposing arms <b>940</b> and more specifically, the gripping sections <b>944</b> are disposed adjacent the base section <b>41</b> of the tip cap <b>40</b> underneath the flange <b>43</b> with the notches being aligned with the outer surface of the base section <b>41</b>. An actuator or the like of the device <b>900</b> is then activated causing the gripping arms <b>940</b> to move inwardly toward one another until the gripping sections <b>944</b> seat against the outer surface of the base section <b>41</b> of the tip cap <b>40</b>. Preferably, a hydraulic or pneumatic system can be used to move the gripping arms <b>940</b> between their relative positions. In this closed position, the gripping arms <b>940</b> apply a force against the base section <b>41</b> so that the tip cap <b>40</b> is securely held by the gripping sections. When the gripping arms <b>940</b> are driven to the closed position, the gripping sections may seat against one another and the notches align such that the gripping sections substantially encircle the base section <b>41</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0122">After the tip cap <b>40</b> is nested within the gripping sections, the control unit <b>950</b> directs the vertical base <b>910</b> upward and this motion causes the tip cap <b>40</b> to be removed from the post <b>161</b>. After the tip cap <b>40</b> is freed from the post <b>161</b>, it remains held between the gripping sections of the opposing arms <b>940</b>. The vertical base <b>910</b> is then driven in a direction away from the dial <b>130</b> until the held tip cap <b>40</b> is positioned over the barrel tip <b>28</b>. Once the tip cap <b>40</b> is disposed over the barrel tip <b>28</b> of the filled syringe <b>10</b>, the controller <b>950</b> instructs the vertical base <b>910</b> to move downwardly so that the tip cap <b>40</b> is placed on the barrel tip <b>28</b> as shown in FIG. <b>15</b>. The actuator is then activated causing the gripping arms <b>940</b> to move to the open position, thereby releasing the tip cap <b>40</b>. The tip cap <b>40</b> is now firmly secured back on the barrel tip <b>28</b>. The device <b>900</b> then is returned to its initial position, the dial <b>130</b> is advanced and the operation is repeated with the device <b>900</b> gripping and replacing one tip cap <b>40</b> back on the next uncapped syringe <b>10</b> that is advanced to this station.</p>
  <p num="p-0123">The capped syringe <b>10</b> can then be transferred to other stations, such as a station where the syringe in bandolier form is cut into individual syringes <b>10</b> that are labeled for particular patients. The syringes <b>10</b> can then be unloaded from the dial <b>130</b> by manipulating the second retaining member <b>136</b> and more specifically, the operable pivotable arms <b>143</b>, <b>145</b>, (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) are opened after an unloading gripper (not shown) grips the barrel <b>20</b> of the syringe <b>10</b> and withdraws it from the dial <b>130</b>. The syringe <b>10</b> is then further processed as for example by being delivered to a storage receptacle where it is stored or by being delivered to a transporting device for delivery to the patient.</p>
