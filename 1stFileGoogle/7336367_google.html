polarized components, radiating the two light beams to an external optical system, and combining the two light beams reflected by the external optical system to generate combined light; a phase plate provided between the light source and the polarizing light splitting unit and adapted for changing the polarization state of the light emitted from the light source and leading the light to the polarizing light splitting unit; light splitting films for splitting the combined light generated by the polarizing light splitting unit into plural light beams; polarizing units for transmitting only a predetermined polarized components of the split combined light beams; and light-receiving elements for photoelectrically converting coherent light beams transmitted through the polarizing units and thus generating an interference signal.</div>

<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
  <p num="p-0004">This invention relates to a light-receiving/emitting composite unit, a method for manufacturing the same, and a displacement detection device for detecting a relative shift position of a moving part of a machine tool, a semiconductor manufacturing device or the like.</p>
  <p num="p-0005">This application claims priority of Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2002-127525, 2002-127526 and 2002-127527, file on Apr. 26, 2002, the entireties of which are incorporated by reference herein.</p>
  <p num="p-0006">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
  <p num="p-0007">Conventionally, an optical displacement detection device using a diffraction grating has been known as a device for detecting a relative shift position of a moving part of a machine tool, a semiconductor manufacturing device or the like.</p>
  <p num="p-0008">For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> show a conventional optical displacement measuring device proposed in the Japanese Publication of Laid-Open Patent Application No. S60-98302. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view schematically showing this conventional optical displacement measuring device <b>100</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a side view schematically showing this conventional optical displacement measuring device <b>100</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0009">The conventional optical displacement measuring device <b>100</b> has a diffraction grating <b>101</b> which linearly moves in the directions of arrows X<b>1</b> and X<b>2</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> along with the movement of a moving part of a machine tool or the like, a light source <b>102</b> for emitting light, a half mirror <b>103</b> for splitting the light emitted from the light source <b>102</b> into two beams and superposing two diffracted light beams from the diffraction grating <b>101</b> to cause interference, two mirrors <b>104</b> <i>a</i>, <b>104</b> <i>b </i>for reflecting the diffracted light beams diffracted from the diffraction grating <b>101</b>, and a photodetector <b>105</b> for photoelectrically converting the two diffracted light beams interfering with each other and thus generating an interference signal.</p>
  <p num="p-0010">The light emitted from the light source <b>102</b> is split into two beams by the half mirror <b>103</b>. These two beams are cast on the diffraction grating <b>101</b>. Each of the two beams cast on the diffraction grating <b>101</b> is diffracted by the diffraction grating <b>101</b> and becomes diffracted light (hereinafter this diffracted light is referred to as first-time diffracted light). This first-time diffracted light is reflected by the mirrors <b>104</b> <i>a</i>, <b>104</b> <i>b</i>. The first-time diffracted light reflected by the mirrors <b>104</b> <i>a</i>, <b>104</b> <i>b </i>is cast again on the diffraction grating <b>101</b> and diffracted again (hereinafter this re-diffracted light referred to as second-time diffracted light). The two second-time diffracted light beams become incident on the half mirror <b>103</b> through the same optical path, then superposed to interfere with each other, and cast on the photodetector <b>105</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0011">In such a conventional optical displacement measuring device <b>100</b>, displacement of the diffraction grating <b>101</b> in the directions of arrows X<b>1</b> and X<b>2</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> can be detected. Specifically, in the optical displacement measuring device <b>100</b>, a phase difference is generated in the two second-time diffracted light beams from the diffraction grating <b>101</b> in accordance with the movement of the diffraction grating <b>101</b>. Therefore, this optical displacement measuring device <b>100</b> can measure the shift position of a moving part of a machine tool or the like by detecting the phase difference between the two second-time diffracted light beams from an interference signal provided from the photodetector.</p>
  <p num="p-0012"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> show another conventional optical displacement measuring device proposed in the Japanese Publication of Laid-Open Patent Application No. H60-98302. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view schematically showing a conventional optical displacement measuring device <b>110</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a side view schematically showing the conventional optical displacement measuring device <b>110</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0013">The conventional optical displacement measuring device <b>110</b> has a diffraction grating <b>111</b> which linearly moves in the directions of arrows X<b>1</b> and X<b>2</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> along with the movement of a moving part of a machine tool or the like, a light source <b>112</b> for emitting light, a half mirror <b>113</b> for splitting the light emitted from the light source <b>112</b> into two beams and superposing two diffracted light beams from the diffraction grating <b>111</b> to cause interference, two first mirrors <b>114</b> <i>a</i>, <b>114</b> <i>b </i>for casting the two beams split by the half mirror <b>113</b> at the same position on the diffraction grating <b>111</b>, two second mirrors <b>115</b> <i>a</i>, <b>115</b> <i>b </i>for reflecting the diffracted light beams diffracted from the diffraction grating <b>111</b>, and a photodetector <b>116</b> for receiving the two diffracted light beams interfering with each other and thus generating an interference signal.</p>
  <p num="p-0014">The light emitted from the light source <b>112</b> is split into two beams by the half mirror <b>113</b>. These two beams are reflected by the first mirrors <b>114</b> <i>a</i>, <b>114</b> <i>b</i>, respectively, and cast at the same position on the diffraction grating <b>111</b>. Each of the two beams cast on the diffraction grating <b>111</b> is diffracted by the diffraction grating <b>111</b> and becomes first-time diffracted light. This first-time diffracted light is reflected by the second mirrors <b>115</b> <i>a</i>, <b>115</b> <i>b</i>. The first-time diffracted light is cast again on the diffraction grating <b>111</b> and diffracted to become second-time diffracted light. The two second-time diffracted light beams become incident on the half mirror <b>113</b> through the same optical path, then superposed to interfere with each other, and cast on the photodetector <b>116</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0015">In such a conventional optical displacement measuring device <b>110</b>, displacement of the diffraction grating <b>111</b> in the directions of arrows X<b>1</b> and X<b>2</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> can be detected. Specifically, in the optical displacement measuring device <b>110</b>, a phase difference is generated in the two second-time diffracted light beams from the diffraction grating <b>111</b> in accordance with the movement of the diffraction grating <b>111</b>. Therefore, this optical displacement measuring device <b>110</b> can measure the shift position of a moving part of a machine tool or the like by detecting the phase difference between the two second-time diffracted light beams from an interference signal provided from the photodetector <b>116</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0016">However, in the manufacturing process, it is necessary to assemble the above-described conventional optical displacement measuring devices <b>100</b> and <b>110</b> while adjusting the separately manufactured individual optical components. Therefore, precise adjustment is required with respect to unevenness in accuracy of completion and characteristics of each component, and the process is complicated. Moreover, the device lacks stability with the lapse of time and reduction in size and weight of the whole device is obstructed.</p>
  <p num="p-0017">The polarization axis of the light emitted from the light source must be adjusted to an angle at which the light is distributed at a ratio of one to one by the half mirrors <b>103</b>, <b>113</b>. Therefore, a more complicated process must be introduced and an excessive space is necessary in the device.</p>
  <p num="p-0018">Moreover, in the manufacturing process, it is necessary to assemble the above-described conventional optical displacement measuring devices <b>100</b> and <b>110</b> while adjusting the separately manufactured individual optical components. Therefore, precise adjustment is required with respect to unevenness in accuracy of completion and characteristics of each component. A complicated process must be introduced, thus obstructing reduction in price.</p>
  <p num="p-0019">As a large space is necessary for adjusting, fastening and fixing the components, miniaturization of the whole device cannot be realized.</p>
  <p num="p-0020">Furthermore, since an adhesive must be used for fixing the components, the adhesive state changes depending on the environmental changes, and a deviation between the components may occur because of the environmental changes and changes with the lapse of time.</p>
  <p num="p-0021">Meanwhile, when a difference occurs in the optical path lengths of the two beams split by the above-described half mirror <b>113</b>, a phase change occurs, causing a measurement error. Therefore, in the optical displacement measuring device <b>100</b> and <b>110</b>, the optical path lengths of the above-described two split beams must be adjusted to be equal in order to realize desired characteristics.</p>
  <p num="p-0022"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a conventional optical displacement measuring device in which the optical path length of the split beams can be adjusted to be equal, proposed in the Japanese Publication of Laid-Open Patent Application No. S61-83911.</p>
  <p num="p-0023">This conventional optical displacement measuring device <b>120</b> has a diffraction grating <b>121</b> which linearly moves in the directions of arrows X<b>1</b> and X<b>2</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> along with the movement of a moving part of a machine tool or the like, a light source <b>122</b> made of a multi-mode semiconductor laser for emitting light, a half mirror <b>123</b> for splitting the light emitted from the light source <b>122</b> into two beams and superposing two diffracted light beams from the diffraction grating <b>121</b> to cause interference, two mirrors <b>124</b> <i>a</i>, <b>124</b> <i>b </i>for reflecting the diffracted light beams diffracted from the diffraction grating <b>121</b>, a half mirror <b>125</b> for separating the diffracted light beams interfering with each other, and photodetectors <b>126</b> <i>a</i>, <b>126</b> <i>b </i>for photoelectrically converting these diffracted light beams to generate an interference signal.</p>
  <p num="p-0024">The light emitted from the light source <b>122</b> is split into two beams by the half mirror <b>123</b>. These two beams are cast on the diffraction grating <b>121</b>. Each of the two beams cast on the diffraction grating <b>121</b> is diffracted by the diffraction grating <b>121</b> and becomes first-time diffracted light. The first-time diffracted light is reflected by the mirrors <b>124</b> <i>a</i>, <b>124</b> <i>b</i>. The first-time diffracted light is cast again on the diffraction grating <b>121</b> and diffracted to become second-time diffracted light. The two second-time diffracted light beams become incident on the half mirror <b>123</b> through the same optical path, then superposed to interfere with each other, and cast on the photodetectors <b>126</b> <i>a</i>, <b>126</b> <i>b </i>via the half mirror <b>125</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0025">In such a conventional optical displacement measuring device <b>120</b>, since a multi-mode semiconductor laser is used as the light source, displacement of the diffraction grating <b>121</b> in the directions of arrows X<b>1</b> and X<b>2</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> can be detected while the optical path lengths of the split beams can be controlled. That is, in this optical displacement measuring device <b>120</b>, since the difference in optical path length can be detected, precise adjustment of the optical path length can be realized. Moreover, since the adjustment state can be monitored, an error based on a change in wavelength can be easily identified.</p>
  <p num="p-0026">Meanwhile, in the above-described optical displacement measuring devices <b>100</b> and <b>110</b>, position detection is difficult when rotational shift in the directions of arrows A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b> and rotational shift in the directions of arrows B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> occur, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>. To prevent the influence of such changes in angle of the diffraction grating, another optical displacement measuring device is proposed, for example, in the Japanese Publication of Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2000-81308.</p>
  <p num="p-0027">This conventional optical displacement measuring device <b>130</b> has a diffracting grating <b>131</b> which is mounted on a moving part of a machine tool or the like and linearly moves, a light source <b>132</b> for emitting light, a light-receiving element <b>133</b> for receiving two second-time diffracted light beams Lc<b>1</b>, Lc<b>2</b> interfering with each other and thus generating an interference signal, a position detecting unit <b>134</b> for detecting a shift position from the diffraction grating <b>131</b> on the basis of the interference signal from the light-receiving element <b>133</b>, an irradiation light-receiving optical system <b>135</b> for splitting light La emitted from the light source <b>132</b> into two beams La<b>1</b>, La<b>2</b> and casting the two beams on the diffraction grating <b>131</b> and for causing the second-time diffracted light beams Lc<b>1</b>, Lc<b>2</b> from the diffraction grating <b>131</b> to interfere with each other and casting these second-time diffracted light beams on the light-receiving element <b>133</b>, and a reflection optical system <b>136</b> for reflecting two first-time diffracted light beams Lb<b>1</b>, Lb<b>2</b> from the diffraction grating <b>131</b> and casting these first-time diffracted light beams again on the diffraction grating <b>131</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0028">The irradiation light-receiving optical system <b>135</b> has a first image-forming element <b>141</b> for causing image formation of the light La emitted from the light source <b>132</b> onto the lattice plane of the diffraction grating <b>131</b>, a half mirror <b>142</b> for splitting the light La emitted from the light source into the two beams La<b>1</b>, La<b>2</b> and superposing the two second-time diffracted light beams Lc<b>1</b>, Lc<b>2</b> from the diffraction grating <b>131</b> to cause interference, a reflector <b>143</b> for reflecting the light beams La<b>1</b>, La<b>2</b> split by the half mirror <b>142</b> and reflecting the second-time diffracted light beams Lc<b>1</b>, Lc<b>2</b>, and a second image-forming element <b>144</b> for causing image formation of the two second diffracted light beams Lc<b>1</b>, Lc<b>2</b> superposed by the half mirror <b>142</b> onto the light-receiving surface of the light-receiving element <b>133</b>.</p>

  <p num="p-0030">In the optical displacement measuring device <b>130</b> of the above-described structure, as the diffraction grating <b>131</b> shifts in a direction X<b>1</b> or X<b>2</b> in accordance with the movement of the moving part, a phase difference is generated between the two second-time diffracted light beams Lc<b>1</b>, Lc<b>2</b>. In this optical displacement measuring device <b>130</b>, the two second-time diffracted light beams Lc<b>1</b>, Lc<b>2</b> are caused to interfere with each other and an interference signal is detected.

  <p num="p-0031">Moreover, in this optical displacement measuring device <b>130</b>, the first image-forming element <b>141</b> causes image formation of the light La emitted from the light source <b>132</b> on the lattice plane of the diffraction grating <b>131</b> and the third image-forming elements <b>148</b> collimate the first-time diffracted light beams Lb<b>1</b>, Lb<b>2</b> and constantly cast the collimated light beams perpendicularly to the reflectors <b>146</b>. Therefore, the first-time diffracted light beams Lb<b>1</b>, Lb<b>2</b> reflected by the reflectors <b>146</b> necessarily return on the same optical paths as in the case of incidence and become incident on the same point of incidence on the lattice plane of the diffraction grating <b>131</b>, even when their optical axes are deviated from each other. Therefore, in this optical displacement measuring device <b>130</b>, even when the diffraction grating <b>130</b> is inclined, the second-time diffracted light beams Lc<b>1</b>, Lc<b>2</b> necessarily pass the same optical paths as in the case of incidence. There is no change in their optical path lengths.</p>
  <p num="p-0032">However, the optical displacement measuring device <b>120</b> using a multi-mode semiconductor laser as the light source, proposed in the Japanese Publication of Laid-Open Patent Application No. S61-83911, has a problem that a general semiconductor laser cannot be used, though the device can control the optical path length with respect to changes in wavelength of the light source and thus can realize stable characteristics. Moreover, the optical displacement measuring device <b>120</b> cannot deal with changes in angle of the diffraction grating and has a problem that allowable errors are limited not only at the time of actually mounting the components constituting the device but also at the time of mounting the diffraction grating on the moving part.</p>
  <p num="p-0033">In the optical displacement measuring device <b>130</b> proposed in the Japanese Publication of Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2000-81308, which reduces the influence of changes in angle of the diffraction grating, an image-forming element such as a lens must be used for realizing angle adjustment of the optical path and the structure of the device is complicated. Moreover, since this optical displacement measuring device <b>130</b> uses individual components such as lenses and half mirrors, the device lacks stability with the lapse of time and miniaturization of the device is seriously obstructed.</p>

  </description-of-drawings> <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p num="p-0067">First, a displacement detection device according to a first embodiment of the present invention will be described.</p>
  <p num="p-0068">A displacement detection device <b>10</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention has a transmission-type diffraction grating <b>11</b> which is mounted on a moving part of a machine tool or the like and linearly moves, a light-receiving/emitting composite unit <b>12</b> for splitting light emitted from a light-emitting element into two light beams La<b>1</b>, La<b>2</b> and radiating the two light beams and for causing two second-time diffracted light beams Lc<b>1</b>, Lc<b>2</b> diffracted by the diffraction grating <b>11</b> to interfere with each other and thus detecting an interference signal, reflecting members <b>13</b> <i>a</i>, <b>13</b> <i>b </i>for casting the two light beams La<b>1</b>, La<b>2</b> radiated from the light-receiving/emitting composite unit <b>12</b> onto the diffraction grating <b>11</b> and leading the two second-time diffracted light beams Lc<b>1</b>, Lc<b>2</b> from the diffraction grating <b>11</b> to the light-receiving/emitting composite unit <b>12</b>, and a reflection optical system <b>14</b> for reflecting two first-time diffracted light beams Lb<b>1</b>, Lb<b>2</b> from the diffraction grating <b>11</b> and casting the first-time diffracted light beams again on the diffraction grating <b>11</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0069">The diffraction grating <b>11</b> has, for example, a thin plate-like shape and has narrow slits or grooves, or lattices with distributed refractive index, engraved at predetermined intervals on its surface, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Light incident on such a diffraction grating <b>11</b> is diffracted by the slits or the like engraved on the surface and transmitted through the diffraction grating <b>11</b>. The diffracted light due to the diffraction is generated in a direction defined by the interval of the lattice and the wavelength of the light.</p>
  <p num="p-0070">In the description of the embodiments of the present invention, the surface of the diffraction grating <b>11</b> on which the lattice is formed is referred to as lattice plane <b>11</b> <i>a</i>. If the diffraction grating <b>11</b> is of transmission type, both the surface on which light is incident and the surface on which diffracted light is generated are referred to as lattice planes <b>11</b> <i>a</i>. The directions in which the lattice of the diffraction grating <b>11</b> is formed (directions of arrows C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), that is, the directions perpendicular to a lattice vector representing the direction of a change in transmittance and reflectance of the lattice or a change in depth of the grooves or the like and parallel to the lattice plane <b>11</b> <i>a</i>, are referred to as lattice directions. The directions perpendicular to the direction in which the lattice is formed and parallel to the lattice plane <b>11</b> <i>a </i>(directions of arrows D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), that is, the directions parallel to the lattice vector of the diffraction grating <b>11</b>, are referred to as lattice vector directions. These directions on the diffraction grating <b>11</b> are similarly referred to not only in the first embodiment of the present invention but also in the other embodiments.</p>
  <p num="p-0071">The diffraction grating <b>11</b> is mounted on a moving part of a machine tool or the like and shifts in the directions of arrows D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, that is, in the lattice vector directions, along with the movement of the moving part.</p>
  <p num="p-0072">In the present invention, the type of the diffraction grating is not limited. Not only a diffraction grating having a mechanically formed grooves or the like as described above but also a diffraction grating prepared by, for example, printing interference fringes on a photosensitive resin, may be used.</p>
  <p num="p-0073">The reflecting member <b>13</b> <i>a </i>reflects the light La<b>1</b> and casts the light La<b>1</b> at a predetermined position on the lattice plane <b>11</b> <i>a </i>of the diffraction grating <b>11</b>. As this light La<b>1</b> is diffracted by the diffraction grating <b>11</b>, the first-time diffracted light Lb<b>1</b> is provided. The reflecting member <b>13</b> <i>b </i>reflects the light La<b>2</b> and casts the light La<b>2</b> at a predetermined position on the lattice plane <b>11</b> <i>a </i>of the diffraction grating <b>11</b>. As this light La<b>2</b> is diffracted by the diffraction grating <b>11</b>, the first-time diffracted light Lb<b>2</b> is provided.</p>
  <p num="p-0074">The second-time diffracted light Lc<b>1</b>, generated as the first-time diffracted light Lb<b>1</b> is diffracted by the diffraction grating <b>11</b>, is cast on the reflecting member <b>13</b> <i>a</i>. The reflecting member <b>13</b> <i>a </i>reflects this second-time diffracted light Lc<b>1</b> and casts the second-time diffracted light Lc<b>1</b> on the light-receiving/emitting composite unit <b>12</b>. The second-time diffracted light Lc<b>2</b>, generated as the first-time diffracted light Lb<b>2</b> is diffracted by the diffraction grating <b>11</b>, is cast on the reflecting member <b>13</b> <i>b</i>. The reflecting member <b>13</b> <i>b </i>reflects this second-time diffracted light Lc<b>2</b> and casts the second-time: diffracted light Lc<b>2</b> on the light-receiving/emitting composite unit <b>12</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0075">The predetermined position at which the light is cast by the reflecting member <b>13</b> <i>a </i>on the lattice plane <b>11</b> <i>a </i>of the diffraction grating <b>11</b> and the predetermined position at which the light is cast by the reflecting member <b>13</b> <i>b </i>on the lattice plane <b>11</b> <i>a </i>of the diffraction grating <b>11</b> may be close to each other. This can reduce the difference in optical path length caused by the evenness in thickness or the like within the diffraction grating <b>11</b> and thus can reduce errors due to the unevenness in thickness or the like of the scale.</p>
  <p num="p-0076">The reflection optical system <b>14</b> has a reflector <b>26</b> for reflecting the first-time diffracted light Lb<b>1</b> and casting the first-time diffracted light Lb<b>1</b> again on the diffraction grating <b>11</b>, a reflector <b>27</b> for reflecting the first-time diffracted light Lb<b>2</b> and casting the first-time diffracted light Lb<b>2</b> again on the diffraction grating <b>11</b>, a ¼ wave plate WP<b>1</b> for changing the polarization state of the first-time diffracted light Lb<b>1</b>, and a ¼ wave plate WP<b>2</b> for changing the polarization state of the first-time diffracted light Lb<b>2</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0077">The first-time diffracted light Lb<b>1</b> which has passed through the ¼ wave plate WP<b>1</b> is cast on the reflector <b>26</b>. The reflector <b>26</b> perpendicularly reflects the first-time diffracted light Lb<b>1</b> so that this first-time diffracted light Lb<b>1</b> returns on the same path as the path of incidence. Since the first-time diffracted light Lb<b>1</b> cast on the reflector <b>26</b> has already passed through the ¼ wave plate WP<b>1</b> and the first-time diffracted light Lb<b>1</b> reflected by this reflector <b>26</b> passes through the ¼ wave plate WP<b>1</b> again, the first-time diffracted light Lb<b>1</b> is cast again on the diffraction grating <b>11</b> with its direction of polarization rotated 90 degrees.</p>
  <p num="p-0078">The first-time diffracted light Lb<b>2</b> which has passed through the ¼ wave plate WP<b>2</b> is cast on the reflector <b>27</b>. The reflector <b>27</b> perpendicularly reflects the first-time diffracted light Lb<b>2</b> so that this first-time diffracted light Lb<b>2</b> returns on the same path as the path of incidence. Since the first-time diffracted light Lb<b>2</b> cast on the reflector <b>27</b> has already passed through the ¼ wave plate WP<b>2</b> and the first-time diffracted light Lb<b>2</b> reflected by this reflector <b>27</b> passes through the ¼ wave plate WP<b>2</b> again, the first-time diffracted light Lb<b>2</b> is cast again on the diffraction grating <b>11</b> with its direction of polarization rotated 90 degrees.</p>
  <p num="p-0079">The reflection optical system <b>14</b> is not limited to the above-described structure. For example, a reflection prism may be used. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the structure of the displacement detection device <b>10</b> using a reflection prism for the reflection optical system <b>14</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the same constituent elements and members as those in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> are not described.</p>
  <p num="p-0080">A ¼ wave plate WP<b>31</b> is sequentially stacked on a reflection prism <b>30</b>. The first-time diffracted light beams Lb<b>1</b>, Lb<b>2</b> which have passed through the ¼ wave plate WP<b>31</b> are cast on a reflection surface <b>30</b> <i>a </i>of this reflection prism <b>30</b>. The reflection surface <b>30</b> <i>a </i>perpendicularly reflects the first-time diffracted light beams Lb<b>1</b>, Lb<b>2</b> so that these first-time diffracted light beams Lb<b>1</b>, Lb<b>2</b> return on the same paths as their paths of incidence. Since the first-time diffracted light beams Lb<b>1</b>, Lb<b>2</b> cast on this reflection surface <b>30</b> <i>a </i>have already passed through the ¼ wave plate WP<b>31</b> and the first-time diffracted light beams Lb<b>1</b>, Lb<b>2</b> reflected by the reflection surface <b>30</b> <i>a </i>pass the ¼ wave plate WP<b>31</b> again, these first-time diffracted light beams Lb<b>1</b>, Lb<b>2</b> are cast again on the diffraction grating <b>11</b> with their direction of polarization rotated 90 degrees.</p>
  <p num="p-0081">The light-receiving/emitting composite unit <b>12</b> will now be described in detail. The light-receiving/emitting composite unit <b>12</b> has a housing member <b>40</b> for housing a light-emitting element and a light-receiving element, a composite lens unit <b>41</b> including plural lenses (<b>41</b> <i>a</i>, <b>41</b>_<b>1</b>, <b>41</b>_<b>2</b>, <b>41</b>_<b>3</b>, and <b>41</b>_<b>4</b>), polarizing units <b>42</b> (<b>42</b>_<b>1</b>, <b>42</b>_<b>2</b>, <b>42</b>_<b>3</b>, and <b>42</b>_<b>4</b>) for transmitting only a predetermined polarized component, a phase plate <b>43</b> for changing the polarization state of light, and a light splitting unit <b>44</b> for splitting the light cast on the diffraction grating <b>11</b> or splitting the second-time diffracted light beams Lc<b>1</b>, Lc<b>2</b> obtained through diffraction by the diffraction grating <b>11</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0082">The housing member <b>40</b> has a light source <b>51</b> for radiating light La, a light-receiving element <b>52</b> (<b>52</b>_<b>1</b>, <b>52</b>_<b>2</b>, <b>52</b>_<b>3</b>, and <b>52</b>_<b>4</b>) for photoelectrically converting coherent light, which will be described later, and thus generating an interference signal, a semiconductor substrate <b>53</b> for installing the light source <b>51</b> thereon and performing optical path control by applying an electric signal thereto or using a reflection surface <b>53</b> <i>a</i>, and a semiconductor substrate <b>54</b> for installing the light-receiving element thereon and taking out an electric signal.</p>
  <p num="p-0083">The light splitting unit <b>44</b> has a polarizing light splitting unit <b>58</b> for splitting the light La radiated from the light source <b>51</b> into two light beams La<b>1</b>, La<b>2</b> and radiating the two light beams La<b>1</b>, La<b>2</b> and for combining two second-time diffracted light beams Lc<b>1</b>, Lc<b>2</b> from the reflecting members <b>13</b> <i>a</i>, <b>13</b> <i>b </i>to generate combined light Ld, and light splitting films <b>59</b>_<b>1</b>, <b>59</b>_<b>2</b>, <b>59</b>_<b>3</b> and <b>59</b>_<b>4</b> for splitting the combined light Ld cast from the polarizing light splitting unit <b>58</b> into combined light beams Ld<b>1</b>, Ld<b>2</b>, Ld<b>3</b> and Ld<b>4</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0084">The light source <b>51</b> is an element for emitting coherent light such as a laser beam. This light source <b>51</b> may be, for example, a multi-mode semiconductor laser for emitting a laser beam having a small coherence length.</p>
  <p num="p-0085">The light-emitting element <b>52</b> is a photoelectric conversion element for converting light cast on its light-receiving surface into an electric signal corresponding to the quantity of light. For example, the light-emitting element <b>52</b> is made of a photodetector or the like. This light-receiving element <b>52</b> receives the coherent light beams Ld<b>1</b>, Ld<b>2</b>, Ld<b>3</b> and Ld<b>4</b> cast on its light-receiving surface and generates an interference signal corresponding to the quantity of light.</p>
  <p num="p-0086">The interference signal generated by photoelectric conversion at the light-receiving element <b>52</b> is detected by a position detecting unit, not shown, via the semiconductor substrate <b>54</b>. This position detecting unit, not shown, finds a phase difference based on the resultant interference signal and outputs a position signal indicating the relative shift position of the diffraction grating <b>11</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0087">The composite lens unit <b>41</b> includes optical elements such as lenses having a predetermined numerical aperture. The light La radiated from the light source <b>51</b> is cast on the lens <b>41</b> <i>a</i>. The lens <b>41</b> <i>a </i>can perform image formation of the incident light La with a predetermined beam diameter on the lattice plane <b>11</b> <i>a </i>of the diffraction grating <b>11</b> or on the reflectors <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>. In this first embodiment, since the transmission-type diffraction grating <b>11</b> is used, image formation of the radiated light La is normally done on the reflectors <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>. Therefore, the diameter of the beam cast on the lattice plane <b>11</b> <i>a </i>can be increased and the influence of dust and scratches on the lattice plane <b>11</b> <i>a </i>can be reduced. As the composite lens unit <b>41</b> for controlling the beam diameter of the light radiated to outside and of the received light is arranged in a single package, it is possible to increase the degree of integration, simplify the preparation process, and increase the reliability of the whole device.</p>
  <p num="p-0088">The coherent light beams Ld<b>1</b>, Ld<b>2</b>, Ld<b>3</b> and Ld<b>4</b> radiated from the polarizing units <b>42</b> become incident on the lenses <b>41</b>_<b>1</b>, <b>41</b>_<b>2</b>, <b>41</b>_<b>3</b> and <b>41</b>_<b>4</b>, respectively. The lenses <b>41</b>_<b>1</b>, <b>41</b>_<b>2</b>, <b>41</b>_<b>3</b> and <b>41</b>_<b>4</b> perform image formation of the incident coherent light beams Ld<b>1</b>, Ld<b>2</b>, Ld<b>3</b> and Ld<b>4</b> on the light-receiving elements <b>52</b>_<b>1</b>, <b>52</b>_<b>2</b>, <b>52</b>_<b>3</b> and <b>52</b>_<b>4</b>, respectively. The image forming point need not necessarily be a point where the beam diameter is at its minimum. This composite lens unit <b>41</b> is not limited to the structure in which plural lenses are sequentially connected, as described above. For example, the above-described lenses <b>41</b>_<b>1</b>, <b>41</b>_<b>2</b>, <b>41</b>_<b>3</b> and <b>41</b>_<b>4</b> may be collectively constructed as a single lens. Each lens constituting this composite lens unit <b>41</b> may not only converge a beam but also radiate collimated light or divergent light.</p>
  <p num="p-0089">The polarizing units <b>42</b>_<b>1</b>, <b>42</b>_<b>2</b>, <b>42</b>_<b>3</b> and <b>42</b>_<b>4</b> transmit only predetermined polarized components of the combined light beams Ld<b>1</b>, Ld<b>2</b>, Ld<b>3</b> and Ld<b>4</b> made incident from the phase plate <b>43</b>, and radiate the polarized components to the lens unit <b>41</b> as coherent light beams Ld<b>1</b>, Ld<b>2</b>, Ld<b>3</b> and Ld<b>4</b>. It suffices that the polarizing units <b>42</b> are arranged at a 45-degree spacing from each other (for example, at angles of 5, 50, 95 and 140 degrees, respectively). The polarizing units <b>42</b> can be arranged without being limited in position at the time of mounting. As such polarizing units <b>42</b> are provided between the phase plate <b>43</b> and the composite lens unit <b>41</b>, the structure of the whole unit can be made compact.</p>
  <p num="p-0090">The phase plate <b>43</b> is stacked in such a manner that it is inserted between the polarizing units <b>42</b> and the light splitting unit <b>44</b>. This phase plate <b>43</b> is made of, for example, ¼ wave plate, and performs conversion between circularly polarized light and linearly polarized light. This phase plate <b>43</b> may be made of a film-like ¼ wave plate inclined <b>45</b> degrees with respect to a line AA shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, and in this case, the light La from the light source <b>51</b> becomes incident thereon via the lens <b>41</b> <i>a</i>. The phase plate <b>43</b> converts the light La, which is, for example, linearly polarized light, to circularly polarized light, and casts the resultant light on the polarizing light splitting unit <b>58</b>. Moreover, the phase plate <b>43</b> receives the combined light beams Ld<b>1</b>, Ld<b>2</b>, Ld<b>3</b> and Ld<b>4</b> radiated from the light splitting unit <b>44</b> to circularly polarized light and radiates the resultant light to the above-described polarizing units <b>42</b>. That is, both the conversion of the polarization state of the light La from the light source <b>51</b> and the conversion of the polarization state of the light Ld from the light splitting films <b>59</b> are performed by the single phase plate <b>43</b>. The light-receiving/emitting composite unit <b>12</b> may also employ a structure without having this phase plate <b>43</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0091">The polarizing light splitting unit <b>58</b> is made of, for example, a polarizing beam splitter. The light La radiated from the light source <b>51</b> becomes incident thereon via the phase plate <b>43</b>. The polarizing light splitting unit <b>58</b> reflects a part of the incident light La to generate light La<b>1</b> and transmits a part of the incident light La to generate light La<b>2</b>. The polarizing light splitting unit <b>58</b> may split the light La into S-polarized light and P-polarized light with orthogonal polarized components, as the light La<b>1</b> and the light La<b>2</b>. In this case, the light La<b>1</b> is S-polarized light and the light La<b>2</b> is P-polarized light. Moreover, the second-time diffracted light Lc<b>1</b> and the second-time diffracted light Lc<b>2</b> from the diffraction grating <b>11</b> become incident on the polarizing light splitting unit <b>58</b>. The polarizing light splitting unit <b>58</b> superpose the two second-time diffracted light beams Lc<b>1</b>, Lc<b>2</b> to combine these light beams and radiates the combined light Ld to the light splitting films <b>59</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0092">The reflectance of the light splitting films <b>59</b>_<b>1</b>, <b>59</b>_<b>2</b>, <b>59</b>_<b>3</b> and <b>59</b>_<b>4</b> is set at ¼, ⅓, ½ and 1, respectively. (That is, the light splitting films <b>59</b>_<b>4</b> has a total reflection surface.) Therefore, the incident combined light Ld can be split into combined light beams Ld<b>1</b>, Ld<b>2</b>, Ld<b>3</b> and Ld<b>4</b> with substantially the same quantity of light.</p>
  <p num="p-0093">The light-receiving/emitting composite unit <b>12</b> is constituted as an independent unit, with the above-described housing member <b>40</b>, composite lens unit <b>41</b>, polarizing units <b>42</b>, phase plate <b>43</b> and light splitting unit <b>44</b> provided in the same package. These members are stacked on each other to form an integrated unit.</p>
  <p num="p-0094">That is, as the light-receiving/emitting composite unit <b>12</b> has the integrated structure by packaging the respective members, precise position adjustment is easier. Moreover, since the installation space for the components need not be large, reduction in size and weight of the displacement detection device as a whole can be realized. As the members are housed in the same housing unit, the influence of environmental changes and changes with the lapse of time can be reduced, and deviation and the like at the time of adjustment can be restrained to the minimum level. Thus, the reliability of the whole light-receiving/emitting composite unit <b>12</b> can be increased.</p>
  <p num="p-0095">An exemplary operation of the displacement detection device <b>10</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention will now be described.</p>
  <p num="p-0096">First, the light La radiated from the light source <b>51</b> is reflected by the reflection surface <b>53</b> <i>a </i>of the semiconductor substrate <b>53</b>, for example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, and then cast on the lens <b>41</b> <i>a</i>. The light La is image-converted by the lens <b>41</b> <i>a </i>and cast on the phase plate <b>43</b> made up of, for example, a ¼ wave plate.</p>
  <p num="p-0097">The light La cast on the phase plate <b>43</b> is changed to circularly polarized light by the phase plate <b>43</b>. That is, the linearly polarized light La radiated via the phase plate <b>43</b> can be changed circularly polarized light irrespective of the direction of polarization of the light radiated from the light source <b>51</b>. This enables free selection of a polarized component of the light radiated from the light source <b>51</b>, without inclining the polarized component of the light radiated from the light source <b>51</b> substantially 45 degrees with respect to the polarizing light splitting unit <b>58</b> as in the conventional technique.</p>
  <p num="p-0098">The light La radiated from the phase plate <b>43</b> is split into light beams La<b>1</b>, La<b>2</b>, which are, for example, S-polarized light and P-polarized light, by the polarizing light splitting unit <b>58</b>, and become incident on the diffraction grating <b>11</b> via the reflecting members <b>13</b> <i>a</i>, <b>13</b> <i>b</i>. When the incident angle of the light La<b>1</b> on the diffraction grating <b>11</b> is expressed by θa, the diffraction angle of the light La<b>1</b> is expressed by θa′, the incident angle of the first-time diffracted light Lb<b>1</b> is expressed by θb, and the diffraction angle of the first-time diffracted light Lb<b>2</b> is expressed by θb′, the following equations (11) and (12) hold.
<br>sin θ<i>a</i>+sin θ<i>a′=mλ/d</i>  (11)<br>sin θ<i>b</i>+sin θ<i>b′=mλ/d</i>  (12)<br>
In these equations, d represents the pitch of the diffraction grating, λ represents the wavelength of light, and m represents the order of diffraction. When a volume-type phase hologram is used for the diffraction grating <b>11</b> and Bragg diffraction is used, the light beams are made incident at incident angles that can hold θa=θa′ and θb=θb′. When a volume-type phase hologram is not used for the diffraction grating, the incident angles and the diffraction angles are arbitrary angles represented by the above-described relations.
</p>
  <p num="p-0099">The first-time diffracted light beams Lb<b>1</b>, Lb<b>2</b> are perpendicularly reflected by the reflectors <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>, respectively. In this case, as the first-time diffracted light beams Lb<b>1</b>, Lb<b>2</b> pass through the ¼ wave plates WP<b>1</b>, WP<b>2</b> twice, their directions of polarization are rotated 90 degrees, respectively. Therefore, the first-time diffracted light Lb<b>1</b>, which is originally S-polarized light, is converted to P-polarized light, and the first-time diffracted light Lb<b>2</b>, which is originally P-polarized light, is converted to S-polarized light.</p>
  <p num="p-0100">Next, the first-time diffracted light beams Lb<b>1</b>, Lb<b>2</b> reflected by the reflectors <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> are diffracted again by the diffraction grating <b>11</b> to become second-time diffracted light beams Lc<b>1</b>, Lc<b>2</b> and reach the polarizing light splitting unit <b>58</b> again through the same optical paths. The polarizing light splitting unit <b>58</b> superposes and combines the second-time diffracted light Lc<b>1</b>, which is P-polarized light, and the second-time diffracted light Lc<b>2</b>, which is S-polarized light, thereby generating combined light Ld.</p>
  <p num="p-0101">The combined light Ld is split into Ld<b>1</b>, Ld<b>2</b>, Ld<b>3</b> and Ld<b>4</b> by the light splitting films <b>59</b>_<b>1</b>, <b>59</b>_<b>2</b>, <b>59</b>_<b>3</b> and <b>59</b>_<b>4</b>. The split combined light beams Ld<b>1</b>, Ld<b>2</b>, Ld<b>3</b> and Ld<b>4</b> are cast on the phase plate <b>43</b>. In this case, the second-time diffracted light beams Lc<b>1</b> and Lc<b>2</b> become circularly polarized light beams in the opposite circular directions. When the combined light Ld is received through a polarizing plate which transmits only a specific polarized component, and a specific polarized component is taken out if first-order diffracted light is used in the first and second diffractions, an interference signal I as expressed by the following equation (13) is provided with respect to the combined light Ld.
<br> <i>I=A</i>1<sup>2</sup> <i>+A</i>2<sup>2</sup>+2<i>*A</i>1<i>*A</i>2cos(4<i>*K*x</i>+δ)  (13)<br>
In this equation, A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b> represent the amplitudes of the two superposed second-time diffracted light beams Lc<b>1</b> and Lc<b>2</b>, x represents the quantity of shift of the diffraction grating <b>11</b> in the direction of lattice vector, δ represents the initial phase, and K=2π/d (d representing the lattice pitch). This interference signal I changes by one cycle as the diffraction grating <b>11</b> shifts by the amount of d/4 in the direction of lattice vector. δ represents the quantity dependent on the difference in optical path length between the two superposed second-time diffracted light beams Lc<b>1</b>, Lc<b>2</b>.
</p>
  <p num="p-0102">Of the combined light beams Ld<b>1</b>, Ld<b>2</b>, Ld<b>3</b> and Ld<b>4</b> radiated from the phase plate <b>43</b>, only predetermined polarized components are transmitted by the polarizing units <b>42</b>. The polarizing units <b>42</b> are set at ab interval of 45 degrees from each other. In this example, the polarizing unit <b>42</b>_<b>1</b> transmits only a polarized component in the direction of polarization of 0 degree, and the polarizing unit <b>42</b>_<b>2</b> transmits only a polarized component in the direction of polarization of 45 degrees. The polarizing unit <b>42</b>_<b>3</b> transmits only a polarized component in the direction of polarization of 90 degree, and the polarizing unit <b>42</b>_<b>4</b> transmits only a polarized component in the direction of polarization of 135 degrees. The intensities of the coherent light beams Ld<b>1</b>, Ld<b>2</b>, Ld<b>3</b> and Ld<b>4</b> transmitted through the polarizing units <b>42</b> are expressed by the following equations (21) to (24).
<br>B+A cos(4*K*x+δ)  (21)<br>B+A cos(4*K*x+90°+δ)  (22)<br>B+A cos(4*K*x+180°+δ)  (23)<br>B+A cos(4*K*x+270°+δ)  (24)<br> <i>B</i>=¼(<i>A</i>1<sup>2</sup> <i>+A</i>2<sup>2</sup>)<br> <i>A</i>=½<i>*A</i>1<i>*A</i>2<br>
Equation (21) expresses the intensity of the coherent light Ld<b>1</b> transmitted through the polarizing unit <b>42</b>_<b>1</b>. Equation (22) expresses the intensity of the coherent light Ld<b>2</b> transmitted through the polarizing unit <b>42</b>_<b>2</b>. Equation (23) expresses the intensity of the coherent light Ld<b>3</b> transmitted through the polarizing unit <b>42</b>_<b>3</b>. Equation (24) expresses the intensity of the coherent light Ld<b>4</b> transmitted through the polarizing unit <b>42</b>_<b>4</b>. Image formation of the coherent light beams Ld<b>1</b>, Ld<b>2</b>, Ld<b>3</b> and Ld<b>4</b> expressed by these equations on the light-receiving elements <b>51</b>_<b>1</b>, <b>51</b>_<b>2</b>, <b>51</b>_<b>3</b> and <b>51</b>_<b>4</b> is performed via the lenses <b>41</b>_<b>1</b>, <b>41</b>_<b>2</b>, <b>41</b>_<b>3</b> and <b>41</b>_<b>4</b>. That is, each light-receiving element <b>52</b> photoelectrically converts the coherent light Ld expressed by the above-described equations, thus generating an interference signal.
</p>
  <p num="p-0103">As subtraction between equation (21) and equation (23) is carried out, the DC component of the interference signal can be removed. Similarly, as subtraction between equation (22) and equation (24) is carried out, the DC component of the interference can be removed. Since the signals of the subtraction have phases difference from each other by 90 degrees, a signal for detecting the direction of shift of the diffraction grating can be acquired.</p>
  <p num="p-0104">In this manner, in the displacement detection device <b>10</b> to which the present invention is applied, the phase plate <b>43</b> is stacked to be inserted between the polarizing units <b>42</b> and the light splitting unit <b>44</b>. This phase plate <b>43</b> can convert the linearly polarized light La to circularly polarized light and then cast it on the polarizing light splitting unit <b>58</b>. This enables free selection of a polarized component of the light La radiated from the light source <b>51</b>, without arranging the light source <b>51</b> in such a manner that the polarized component of the light La radiated from the light source <b>51</b> has an angle of about 45 degrees to the polarizing light splitting unit <b>58</b> as in the conventional technique. Accordingly, the problem that an excessively large space for arranging the components is necessary in the light-receiving/emitting unit <b>12</b> can be solved and a more compact structure can be realized. Moreover, this phase plate <b>43</b> can receive the combined light beams Ld<b>1</b>, Ld<b>2</b>, Ld<b>3</b> and Ld<b>4</b> radiated from the light splitting films <b>59</b>_<b>1</b>, <b>59</b>_<b>2</b>, <b>59</b>_<b>3</b> and <b>59</b>_<b>4</b>, then convert these light beams to linearly polarized light beams with their directions of polarization rotated, and radiate the linearly polarized light beams to the above-described polarizing units <b>42</b>. Therefore, it suffices to arrange the directions of polarization of the polarizing units <b>42</b> at an interval of 45 degrees from each other (for example, at 50 degrees, 5 degrees, 140 degrees and 95 degrees), as viewed from the top, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The restraint in mounting the polarizing units <b>42</b> can be reduced and simplification of the manufacturing process and reduction in the manufacturing cost can be realized. Furthermore, since this single phase plate <b>43</b> handles both the conversion of the light La from the light source <b>51</b> and the conversion of the light Ld from the light splitting films <b>59</b>, dimensional control is made easier and further reduction in the manufacturing cost can be realized.</p>

  <p num="p-0119">First, at step S<b>11</b>, alight splitting unit <b>44</b> layer having plural light splitting units <b>44</b> sequentially connected with each other, a phase plate <b>43</b> for the area covering plural light-receiving/emitting composite units <b>12</b>, and a polarizing unit <b>42</b> layer having plural polarizing units <b>42</b> sequentially connected with each other are prepared.

  <p num="p-0128">When the wavelength of the light source changes, if there is a difference between the optical path length from the polarizing light splitting unit <b>58</b> to the reflector <b>26</b> and the optical path length from the polarizing light splitting unit <b>58</b> to the reflector <b>27</b> (hereinafter this difference in optical path length is referred to as ΔL), a measurement error occurs. The amount of error E can be expressed as follows.
<br> <i>E</i>=Δλ/λ*2*<i>ΔL</i>*4<i>/d</i>  (45)<br>
In this equation, λ represents the wavelength of the light source <b>51</b>, Δλ represents the quantity of change in wavelength, ΔL represents the difference in optical path length between two light beams obtained by splitting by the polarizing light splitting unit <b>58</b>, and d represents the lattice pitch of the diffraction grating <b>11</b>.
</p>
  <p num="p-0129">In this case, ΔL must be small so that the amount of error E is within an allowable range with respect to an assumed change in wavelength Δλ. The optical path length is set so that with respect to the lens <b>41</b> <i>a </i>and the lenses <b>41</b>_<b>1</b>, <b>41</b>_<b>2</b>, <b>41</b>_<b>3</b> and <b>41</b>_<b>4</b>, individual radiated light beams are converged at specific points (including virtual image points, but not including points at infinity). In this embodiment, since the two light beams obtained by splitting by the polarizing light splitting unit <b>58</b> pass through the same lens <b>41</b> <i>a</i>, the lengths between the respective points of convergence and the light source <b>51</b>, which is the light-emitting point, are equal. When individual lenses are used for the two light beams obtained by splitting by the polarizing light splitting unit, these lengths are made equal using lenses having the same focal length and the same shape.</p>
  <p num="p-0130"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows the tendency of the light Ld near the light-receiving elements <b>52</b> in this case. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, d represents the quantity of deviation between the positions of convergence of the two light beams. In the case where a solid line represents a luminous flux based on the second-time diffracted light Lc<b>1</b> of the two light beams and a broken line represents a luminous flux based on the second-time diffracted light Lc<b>2</b>, only when the optical path lengths of the two light beams are equal, d=0 is realized and the two luminous fluxes are superposed on each other. When the optical path length of the two light beams are difference, d≠0 holds and concentric interference fringes are generated, thus reducing the intensity of the interference signal. Therefore, by maximizing the interference signal or adjusting the positions of the reflectors <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> (<b>30</b> <i>a</i>) so that the interference image has null fringe, it is possible to equalize the optical path lengths of the two light beams irrespective of the coherence length of the light source <b>51</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0131">As the optical path lengths can be equalized, the measurement error can be reduced even when the wavelength of the light source changes, in accordance with the above-described equation (45).</p>
  <p num="p-0132">In the present invention, the lenses of the composite lens unit <b>41</b> may be adjusted in the following manner.</p>
  <p num="p-0133"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> shows the positional relation between the light-emitting point of the light source <b>51</b> and the reflectors <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> (reflection surface <b>30</b> <i>a</i>). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> shows the positional relation between the reflectors <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> (reflection surface <b>30</b> <i>a</i>) and the light-receiving elements <b>52</b>. The lens <b>41</b> <i>a </i>and the lenses <b>41</b>_<b>1</b>, <b>41</b>_<b>2</b>, <b>41</b>_<b>3</b> and <b>41</b>_<b>4</b> are set to satisfy the following geometrical-optical image forming relations.
<br>1<i>/LO</i>+1<i>/LO</i>′=1<i>/FO</i>  (31)<br>1<i>/LR</i>+1<i>/LR</i>′=1<i>/FR</i>  (32)<br>
In these equations, FO represents the focal length of the lens <b>41</b> <i>a</i>, and FR represents the focal length of the lenses <b>41</b>_<b>1</b>, <b>41</b>_<b>2</b>, <b>41</b>_<b>3</b> and <b>41</b>_<b>4</b>. LO, LO′, LR and LR′ represent geometrical-optical lengths, that is, lengths from the principal planes of the respective lenses <b>41</b>. These lengths are expressed by the following equations, for example, in the case of an optical system shown in FIG. <b>17</b>.
<br>LO=L1  (41)<br> <i>LO′=L</i>2+(<i>L</i>12<i>+L</i>3<i>+L</i>4)/<i>N</i>1<i>+L</i>5<i>+L</i>6+(+7<i>+L</i>8)/<i>N</i>2<i>+L</i>9<i>+L</i>10<i>/N</i>3  (42)<br> <i>LR=L</i>10<i>/N</i>3<i>+L</i>9+(<i>L</i>7<i>+L</i>8)/<i>N</i>2<i>+L</i>6<i>+L</i>5+(<i>L</i>11<i>+L</i>3)/<i>N</i>1<i>+L</i>12  (43)<br> <i>LR′=L</i>13  (44)<br>
In these equations, N<b>1</b> represents the refractive index of the polarizing light splitting unit <b>58</b> and the light splitting films <b>59</b>, N<b>2</b> represents the refractive index of the diffraction grating <b>11</b>, and N<b>3</b> represents the refractive index of the reflection prism. Specifically, in the example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, when the lenses are arranged to satisfy equations (41) to (44), a geometrical-optical image of the light-emitting point is formed on the reflectors <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> and the image on the reflectors <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> is formed on the light-receiving elements <b>52</b>. That is, as the lenses are arranged to satisfy equations (41) to (44), the light source <b>51</b> and the reflectors <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> (<b>30</b> <i>a</i>) are arranged at substantially conjugate positions in the geometrical-optical image forming relation, and the reflectors <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> (<b>30</b> <i>a</i>) and the light-receiving elements <b>52</b> are arranged at substantially conjugate positions in the geometrical-optical image forming relation.
</p>
  <p num="p-0134">In the displacement detection device <b>10</b> employing such an optical system, even when the reflectors <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> are rotated, for example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the position of the image forming point on each light-receiving element <b>52</b> does not change. That is, though the angle of the light Ld incident on each light-receiving element <b>52</b> changes, the position of the image forming point on the light-receiving element <b>52</b> does not change and the optical path length does not change, either. Therefore, the interference signal does not change.</p>
  <p num="p-0135">In the displacement detection device <b>10</b> to which the present invention is applied, the above-described length LR′ may be set to be smaller than the length LR (LR′/LR≦1). The ratio of the amount of shift of the image forming point on the light-receiving elements <b>52</b> to the amount of shift of the image forming point on the reflectors <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> is expressed by LR′/LR. Therefore, as the value of LR′/LR is decreased, the amount of shift of the image forming point on the light-receiving surface can be restrained. That is, as the length LR′ is set to realize LR′/LR≦1, the amount of shift of the image forming point on the light-receiving elements <b>52</b> can be made smaller than the amount of shift of the image forming point on the reflectors <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, and lowering of the intensity of the interference signal can be restrained. Particularly in the present invention where the light-receiving/emitting composite unit <b>12</b> has the housing member <b>40</b>, the composite lens unit <b>41</b>, the polarizing units <b>42</b>, the phase plate <b>43</b> and the light-splitting unit <b>44</b> arranged within the same package and constituting independent units, LR′ can be set at an extremely small value and therefore LR′/LR can be made small.</p>
  <p num="p-0136">That is, in the displacement detection device <b>10</b> to which the present invention is applied, as the lenses constituting the composite lens unit <b>41</b> are arranged as described above, the deviation on the light-receiving elements <b>52</b> can be restrained to the minimum level and its influence on the interference signal can be reduced even when the diffraction grating <b>11</b> or the reflectors <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> are rotated.</p>
  <p num="p-0137">If the light radiated from the lenses <b>41</b> of the composite lens unit <b>41</b> is converged when the lenses <b>41</b> have a small aperture, the beam diameter of the formed image is too small and might be affected by dust and scratches. Therefore, the composite lens unit <b>41</b> may diverge the radiated light to such an extent that the light is not affected by dust and scratches at the image forming point.</p>
  <p num="p-0138">Alternatively, the lenses <b>41</b> of the composite lens unit <b>41</b> may keep the beam diameter on the diffraction grating <b>11</b> and the light-receiving elements <b>52</b> by collimating the radiated light. As this enables realization of a constant beam diameter of light, the allowable width in the directions E<b>1</b> and E<b>2</b> can be increased when mounting the diffraction grating <b>11</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0139">By focusing the light radiated from the lens <b>41</b> <i>a </i>on the reflectors <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> or collimating the light, it is possible to adjust the light beams La<b>1</b>, La<b>2</b> incident on the diffraction grating <b>11</b> and the reflected light beams Lb<b>1</b>, Lb<b>2</b> so that these light beams take the same optical path.</p>
  <p num="p-0140">The displacement detection device to which the present invention is applied is not limited to the above-described embodiments. For example, the present invention can be applied to the following structures. Of these structures, the same constituent elements and members as those of the displacement detection device <b>10</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 9</figref> are denoted by the same numerals and will not be described further in detail.</p>
  <p num="p-0141">A displacement detection device <b>101</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> uses a reflection prism <b>50</b> for a reflection optical system <b>14</b>, and has a ¼ wave plate WP<b>51</b> for transmitting only a first-time diffracted light Lb<b>1</b> and a ¼ wave plate WP<b>52</b> for transmitting only a first-time diffracted light Lb<b>2</b>.

Of the light-receiving/emitting composite unit <b>212</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the same constituent elements as those of the above-described light-receiving/emitting composite unit are denoted by the same numerals and will not be described further in detail.</p>
  <p num="p-0147">The light-receiving/emitting composite unit <b>212</b> has a housing member <b>40</b> for housing a light-emitting element and a light-receiving element, a lens unit <b>241</b>, polarizing units <b>42</b> (<b>42</b>_<b>1</b>, <b>42</b>_<b>2</b>, <b>42</b>_<b>3</b> and <b>42</b>_<b>4</b>) for transmitting only a predetermined polarized component, a phase plate <b>43</b> for changing the polarization state of light, and a light splitting unit <b>44</b> for splitting light to be incident on the diffraction grating <b>11</b> or splitting second-time diffracted light beams Lc<b>1</b>, Lc<b>2</b> obtained by diffraction by the diffraction grating <b>11</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0148">The housing member <b>44</b> has a light source <b>51</b> for radiating light La, light-receiving elements <b>52</b> (<b>52</b>_<b>1</b>, <b>52</b>_<b>2</b>, <b>52</b>_<b>3</b> and <b>52</b>_<b>4</b>) for photoelectrically converting coherent light, which will be described later, to generate an interference signal, a semiconductor substrate <b>53</b> having the light source <b>51</b> installed thereon and adapted for controlling the optical path by applying an electric signal thereon or using a reflection surface <b>53</b> <i>a</i>, and a semiconductor substrate <b>54</b> having the light-receiving elements installed thereon and adapted for taking out an electric signal.</p>
  <p num="p-0149">The light splitting unit <b>44</b> has a polarizing light splitting unit <b>58</b> for splitting the light La radiated from the light source <b>51</b> into two light beams La<b>1</b>, La<b>2</b> and radiating these two light beams La<b>1</b>, La<b>2</b> and for combining second-time diffracted light beams Lc<b>1</b>, Lc<b>2</b> from the reflecting members <b>13</b> <i>a</i>, <b>13</b> <i>b </i>and thus generating combined light Ld, and light splitting films <b>59</b>_<b>1</b>, <b>59</b>_<b>2</b>, <b>59</b>_<b>3</b> and <b>59</b>_<b>4</b> for splitting the combined light Ld cast from the polarizing light splitting unit <b>58</b> into combined light beams Ld<b>1</b>, Ld<b>2</b>, Ld<b>3</b> and Ld<b>4</b>.</p>
  <p num="p-0150">The lens unit <b>241</b> is an optical element such as a lens having a predetermined numerical aperture. The light La radiated from the light source <b>51</b> becomes incident on the lens unit <b>241</b>. The lens unit <b>241</b> causes image formation of the incident light La with a predetermined beam diameter on the lattice plane <b>11</b> <i>a </i>of the diffraction grating <b>11</b> or the reflectors <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>. In the first embodiment, since the transmission-type diffraction grating <b>11</b> is used, the radiated light La is usually caused to form an image on the reflectors <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>. Therefore, the beam diameter of the light cast on the lattice plane <b>11</b> <i>a </i>can be increased and the influence of dust and scratches can be reduced. As the lens unit <b>241</b> for controlling both the beam diameter of the light radiated to outside and the beam diameter of the received light is arranged within the same package, the degree of integration can be increased and the preparation process can be simplified. Thus, the reliability of the whole device can be improved.</p>
  <p num="p-0151">Also the coherent light beams Ld<b>1</b>, Ld<b>2</b>, Ld<b>3</b> and Ld<b>4</b> radiated from the polarizing units <b>42</b> become incident on the lens unit <b>241</b>. The lens unit <b>241</b> causes the incident coherent light beams Ld<b>1</b>, Ld<b>2</b>, Ld<b>3</b> and Ld<b>4</b> to form an image on the light-receiving elements <b>52</b>_<b>1</b>, <b>52</b>_<b>2</b>, <b>52</b>_<b>3</b> and <b>52</b>_<b>4</b>, respectively. The image forming point need not be a point where the beam diameter is at its minimum. For example, a point which realizes the minimum difference in optical path length within the beam image may be situated on the light-receiving surface. The lens unit <b>241</b> may not only converge a beam but also radiate collimated light or divergent light.</p>
  <p num="p-0152">Although the lens unit <b>241</b> realizes image formation of the incident light La and image formation of the coherent light beams Ld<b>1</b>, Ld<b>2</b>, Ld<b>3</b> and Ld<b>4</b> using a single lens unit, the lens unit is not limited to this structure, and for example, plural lens units may be used. Since the lens constituting the lens unit <b>241</b> causes image formation of plural incident light beams at a desired position, various shapes can be applied. For example, when a narrow spacing is to be set between the light-receiving elements <b>52</b>, the spacing between the coherent light beams Ld<b>1</b>, Ld<b>2</b>, Ld<b>3</b> and Ld<b>4</b> needs to be gradually made smaller. Therefore, the shape of the lens unit <b>241</b> is made convex toward the light-receiving elements <b>52</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0153">When a short distance is set between the light source <b>51</b> and the light-receiving elements <b>52</b>, the shape of the lens unit <b>241</b> is made convex near the light source <b>51</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>.</p>
  <p num="p-0154">That is, the lens unit <b>241</b> can decide the image forming point of light on the basis of the arrangement of the light source <b>51</b> and the light-receiving elements <b>52</b>. Also in circuit design, it is possible to provide a degree of freedom in the arrangement of the light source <b>51</b> and the light-receiving elements. Moreover, by providing the lens unit <b>241</b> as an optional unit, it is possible to flexibly deal with various IC specifications.</p>
  <p num="p-0155">The lens unit <b>241</b> is not limited to the above-described form. For example, the lens unit <b>241</b> may be integrated with a composite prism.</p>
  <p num="p-0156">The composite prism controlling the optical path by refracting the incident light La and the coherent light beams Ld<b>1</b>, Ld<b>2</b>, Ld<b>3</b> and Ld<b>4</b>. The composite prism in combination with the lens unit <b>241</b> realizes the above-described effect. For example, the composite prism may be integrally molded with the lens unit <b>241</b> as a molded component.</p>
  <p num="p-0157">It should be understood by those ordinarily skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to the embodiments illustrated in the accompanying drawings but various modifications, alternative constructions or equivalents can be implemented without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention as set forth and defined by the appended claims.</p>
  <p num="p-0158">As described above in detail, according to the present invention, the phase plate is stacked in such a manner that it is inserted between the polarizing units and the light splitting unit. The phase plate can convert linearly polarized light to circularly polarized light and cast the circularly polarized light on the polarizing light splitting unit. This enables free selection of a polarized component of light, without arranging the light source so that the polarized component of the light radiated from the light source is at about 45 degrees with respect to the polarizing light splitting unit as in the conventional technique. Accordingly, the problem that an excessive space is necessary for arrangement of components in the light-receiving/emitting unit <b>12</b> can be solved and a more compact structure can be employed. The phase plate can also receive combined light radiated from the light splitting films and radiate the combined light to the above-described polarizing units. Therefore, it suffices that the directions of polarization of the respective polarizing units are at an interval of 45 degrees from each other, and the restraint at the time of mounting the polarizing units can be reduced. Moreover, it is possible to simplify the manufacturing process and reduce the manufacturing cost. Moreover, since the single phase plate performs both conversion of light from the light source and conversion of light from the light splitting films, dimensional control becomes easier and further reduction in manufacturing cost can be realized.</p>
  <p num="p-0159">Moreover, according to the present invention, as the members are packaged to form the integrated structure, precise position adjustment becomes easier and a large arrangement space for the components is not necessary. Therefore, reduction in size and weight of the whole displacement detection device can be realized. As the members are housed in the same housing member, the influence of environmental changes and changes with the lapse of time can be reduced, and deviation and the like at the time of adjustment can be restrained to the minimum level. Thus, the reliability of the whole device can be improved.</p>
  <p num="p-0160">According to the present invention, since an arbitrary beam diameter can be set for the beam cast on the lattice plane, the influence of dust and scratches can be reduced. As the composite lens unit for controlling both the beam diameter of light radiated to outside and the beam diameter of received light is arranged within the same package, the degree of integration can be increased and the preparation process can be simplified. Therefore, the reliability of the whole device can be improved.</p>
  <p num="p-0161">Moreover, according to the present invention, since a special light source with a limited coherence length need not be used, a typical inexpensive semiconductor laser can be used and significant reduction in cost can be realized. With such a simple structure, a large mounting tolerance can be taken for the diffraction grating, the light-receiving/emitting unit and the like.</p>
  <p num="p-0162">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the lens unit for leading light La radiated from the light source and light radiated from the light splitting unit to predetermined image forming points is provided. The displacement detection device and the light-receiving/emitting composite which have this lens unit can decide the image forming point of light on the basis of the arrangement of the light source and the light-receiving elements. Also in circuit design, it is possible to provide a degree of freedom in the arrangement of the light source and the light-receiving elements. Moreover, by providing the lens unit as an optional unit, it is possible to flexibly deal with various IC specifications.</p>
