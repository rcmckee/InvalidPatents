    <heading>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading> <p num="p-0002">This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/707,660 filed Aug. 12, 2005 entitled Floor Drain Installation System.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">This invention relates to drains and other utility inlet or outlet type fixtures installed in concrete slabs or floors, and, more particularly, to a system for installing such fixtures using a concrete coring adaptor around which the slab is poured. As used herein, the term fixture is generally intended to include inlet or outlet type utility fixtures such as plumbing drains or drain fixtures, cleanouts, or cleanout fixtures as well as inlets or outlets for electrical conduit or other utility applications.</p>
    <p num="p-0004">Drains or drain fixtures are installed in concrete slabs, such as concrete floors in warehouses, garages, basements, parking lots, commercial buildings and residential buildings, to accept water or other liquids from the top surface of the floor and provide a means for such liquids to flow into an underlying drain pipe. The drain is typically funnel shaped, with a tapered upper portion or drain head and a lower stem adapted for connecting the drain to an adaptor or extension member for a drain pipe projecting from the ground or substrate underlying the slab. The drain head includes a grate or strainer at an upper end thereof to prevent large pieces of debris from entering and clogging the drain pipe.</p>
    <p num="p-0005">A typical prior art installation assembly includes a female threaded adaptor or connector that is attached to a vertically extending drain pipe. A drain, drain assembly or cleanout with a threaded lower section is threaded into the adaptor. As used herein, the term drain is intended to be interpreted broad enough to include cleanouts or cleanout cover assemblies as well as drains or drain assemblies. The height of the drain or drain assembly may be minimally adjusted up or down by threading the drain further into or out of the adaptor.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">Typically, drain adaptors and associated drains are installed upon the drain pipe prior to pouring the surrounding concrete slab that typically provides the primary floor support surface. Ideally, the drain is installed by the plumber at the proper height to allow for proper drainage and so that the grate will be flush with the finished floor surface. Plumbers will often cover the drains with duct tape or plastic to prevent the heads of the drains or drain heads from being damaged or infiltrated by concrete during pouring of the floor. Considerable time is then required to clean the drains, to remove tape or the like after the floor has been poured and set. In addition, the drains are subject to damage from heavy loads rolled across the floor during construction of additional building structures.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">Additional problems can arise when a layer of tile or other flooring material is installed over the concrete slab. In such instances, the plumber typically installs the drains so that the top surfaces will extend above the level of the slab a distance equal to the thickness of the flooring. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for concrete crews to mistakenly pour the slab to the top of the drains instead of the specified lower level, thereby creating the need for further upward adjustment of the drains. Such adjustment is often not provided for by the drain and adaptor assembly. Alternatively, concrete crews sometimes take it upon themselves to lower the drains to the level of the concrete pour.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">In either case, once the concrete is poured around the drains and has set, it is usually impossible to raise or lower the drains (accomplished by turning them relative to the associated adaptor) without chipping away the concrete surrounding the drain to provide clearance for lugs usually formed on the bottom of the drain head and to break the adhesion between the concrete and the drain head surface. Similarly, if the building owner later decides to add a layer of flooring over the slab or to substitute existing flooring with a thicker layer, it is usually impossible to raise the drains to the higher level without first chipping or breaking away the concrete from around the drain head.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">It is clear that there is an existing need for a system for installing floor drains that provides for easy installation, reduces damage to drain heads during and after pouring the surrounding slab, and provides a ready means for later height adjustment.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0010">A system for installing inlet or outlet type utility fixtures, such as drains or cleanouts includes an adaptor attached in communication with a conduit, a coring sleeve or receiver attached or formed in communication with the adaptor, and a removable coring plug or cap that fits within an upper portion of the coring sleeve to seal the coring sleeve closed during pouring of a surrounding concrete slab. In one embodiment the coring plug is formed of resilient material capable of withstanding pressure and impact and which is sufficiently inexpensive to manufacture to justify disposal after use. The plug includes a tool-receiving slot or other structure to facilitate removal of the plug after the slab has set. The coring plug cooperates with the coring sleeve to form a cavity or void in the concrete sized to receive the head of the fixture such that it may be connected to the coring sleeve and adjusted such that its upper surface is generally flush with the finished floor. In one embodiment, a bowl formed on an upper end of the coring sleeve defines the void and the plug cooperates with or covers the bowl to keep concrete out of the bowl. In another embodiment the plug or cap forms a substantial portion of the void including the sides thereof. In either case, after the concrete sets, the plug is removed and a fixture such as a drain is threaded into the receiver through the void. The drain head is then raised or lowered to the appropriate height, typically flush with the slab or overlying floor structures, by rotating the drain relative to the receiver.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">The head of the drain typically includes an outwardly projecting flange upon which is mounted or formed a collar which in turn supports a grate or strainer. In the case of slanting floor surfaces or drain pipe assemblies that deviate from near vertical, it may be necessary to cant or tilt the drain head grate relative to the drain in order for it to match the plane of the floor surface. The present invention provides an optional shim that may be installed between an upper surface of the drain head flange and the collar to raise one end of the collar and the grate. The shim may take the form of an annular or semi-annular ring that decreases in thickness from one edge to the opposing edge so as to present the shape of a wedge in cross section. In the semi-annular shim, a gap is formed in the thin end of the shim.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">Other advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein is set forth by way of illustration and example embodiments of the present invention.</p>

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading> <p num="p-0042">As required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein; however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various alternative forms. Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a basis for the claims and as representative bases for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately detailed structure. As used herein, the term concrete is intended to include any material which can be poured and then sets or hardens to form a slab or the like, including a mixture of aggregate and Portland cement and aggregate and asphalt.</p>
    <p num="p-0043">Referring now to the drawings, and in particular to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there are shown components of an embodiment of a floor drain installation system or rough-in assembly <b>1</b> which might more generally be described as a system for connecting utility access fixtures to a conduit in a poured slab. Besides applications in the field of plumbing for drains and cleanouts, it is foreseen that the same structure could be utilized for securing fixtures associated with electrical or ventilation utilities in a concrete slab. The rough-in assembly <b>1</b> is particularly well adapted for connecting a drain or drain assembly <b>5</b> to a drain pipe (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) projecting from a subsurface <b>9</b>, such as ground prepared to receive a poured concrete slab <b>10</b> (see e.g. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>). At its lower end, the drain pipe <b>7</b> is typically contiguously connected to a sanitary plumbing system (not shown). The assembly <b>1</b> includes an adaptor <b>16</b> engaged with or connected to the open, upper end of the drain pipe <b>7</b>, a receiver or coring sleeve <b>18</b> connected to the upper portion of the adaptor <b>16</b>, and a coring plug or cap <b>20</b> removably connected to the upper portion of the coring sleeve <b>18</b> to close off the internal passage or bore that runs through the coring sleeve <b>18</b>, adaptor <b>16</b> and drain pipe <b>7</b>. When these components are attached together to form a floor drain installation system <b>1</b> or rough-in drain assembly <b>1</b> and connected to drain pipe <b>7</b>, the assembly <b>1</b> allows a concrete pad or slab <b>10</b> to be poured level with the upper end of the plug <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, without concrete entering the drain pipe <b>7</b> or clogging the drain <b>5</b>. It should be appreciated that the system disclosed herein will work with any commonly used poured and set flooring such as asphalt or concrete, and/or flooring using set pieces such as brick, flagstone or concrete pavers.</p>
    <p num="p-0044"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an illustration of a conventional drain <b>5</b> which may be secured to the rough-in assembly <b>1</b> once the slab <b>10</b> is poured and allowed to harden and the coring plug <b>20</b> is removed. The drain <b>5</b> shown includes a drain head <b>25</b> including a grate or strainer <b>27</b> provided with slots or holes <b>28</b> for allowing fluid to enter the drain <b>5</b>, and a drain head collar <b>30</b> with an inwardly directed shoulder <b>32</b> for use in attaching the strainer <b>27</b> (or alternatively a clean out cover, not shown) to a drain head flange <b>33</b>. The drain <b>5</b> further comprises a cylindrical stem or neck <b>34</b> with external threads <b>35</b> extending from the bottom of the drain head flange <b>33</b>. The drain head flange <b>33</b> curves or flares upward and radially outward from the threaded neck <b>34</b> terminating in an annular shoulder or lip adapted to support the collar <b>30</b> and strainer <b>27</b>, see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>7</b> and <b>9</b>. The strainer <b>27</b> and collar <b>30</b> are secured on top of the flange <b>33</b> by screws <b>37</b> that thread into tapped holes <b>38</b> in the flange <b>33</b>, see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 9</figref>. The underside of the flange <b>33</b> may be provided with a lug <b>39</b> to accommodate the length of the screw <b>37</b>. The strainer <b>27</b> may be tilted or elevated by insertion of an optional shim <b>90</b> between the strainer <b>27</b> and drain head collar <b>30</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or between the drain head flange <b>33</b> and the collar <b>30</b> as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> (which shows an alternative embodiment <b>91</b> of the shim).</p>
    <p num="p-0045">Returning to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, the rough-in assembly <b>1</b> is connected at its lower end to a drain pipe <b>7</b> by the adaptor <b>16</b>. The adaptor <b>16</b> is generally cylindrical or tubular with an internal bore <b>42</b> therethrough. A lower portion of the adaptor <b>16</b> generally comprises a smooth-walled hub <b>44</b> sized for securement over and cementing or gluing to the drain pipe <b>7</b>. An internal shoulder <b>45</b> formed around the bore <b>42</b> defines an upper end of the glue hub <b>44</b>. An internal thread <b>47</b> is formed in the upper end of the adaptor <b>16</b> for use in connecting the adaptor <b>16</b> to the coring sleeve <b>18</b> as discussed in more detail hereafter.</p>
    <p num="p-0046">The adaptor <b>16</b> may also include a trap primer port <b>49</b> between the glue hub <b>44</b> and the internal thread <b>47</b>. (The trap primer port <b>49</b> is omitted from some of the drawings of the adaptor <b>16</b> to aid in clarity of illustration.) The adaptor <b>16</b> may be constructed of plastic such as the materials disclosed above but is preferably constructed of the same type of plastic that is used to form the drain pipe <b>7</b> so that solvent or cement used to join the adaptor <b>16</b> to the drain pipe <b>7</b> will be chemically compatible with each component.</p>
    <p num="p-0047">With continued reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, the coring sleeve <b>18</b> shown includes a cylindrical base, neck or stem <b>51</b> with a bowl <b>52</b> projecting radially outward from an upper end of the neck <b>51</b> and forming a bowl cavity <b>53</b>. A drain hole or bore <b>54</b> extends through the neck <b>51</b> and opens into the bowl <b>52</b> and bowl cavity <b>53</b>. An external thread <b>55</b> is formed on the outer surface of the coring sleeve neck <b>51</b> and extends upward from a lower end thereof. The neck <b>51</b> and external thread <b>55</b> are sized for threaded receipt or engagement within the upper, internally threaded end of the adaptor <b>16</b>. The threaded connection between the adaptor <b>16</b> and coring sleeve <b>18</b> permits fine adjustment of the overall length of the assembly <b>1</b> and the height or level at which the upper end of the assembly <b>1</b> can be positioned. An internal thread <b>57</b> is formed in the drain hole <b>54</b> of the coring sleeve neck <b>51</b> and extends downward from an upper end or throat <b>58</b> of the neck <b>51</b>. The internal thread <b>57</b> is adapted for initial securement of the coring plug <b>20</b>, and then subsequently a drain <b>5</b>, to the coring sleeve <b>18</b> as discussed hereafter.</p>
    <p num="p-0048">The bowl <b>52</b> projects radially outward and upward from the coring sleeve base or neck <b>51</b> to form the bowl cavity <b>53</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the bowl <b>52</b> includes an annular flange <b>61</b> projecting radially outward and generally horizontal from the throat <b>58</b> of the coring sleeve neck <b>51</b> and an annular wall <b>63</b> projecting upward from the outer margin of the annular flange <b>61</b>. An outer surface <b>65</b> of the annular wall <b>63</b> is preferably drafted at a slight angle inward from the annular flange <b>61</b> upward to a rim or upper edge <b>67</b> of the annular wall <b>63</b>. The outer surface <b>65</b> of the annular wall <b>63</b> may be textured such as with a pattern of ridges <b>69</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to create a mechanical bond between the wall <b>63</b> and the surrounding floor surface such as the concrete slab <b>10</b> shown in the illustrations. The coring sleeve <b>18</b> is typically constructed of plastic materials such as those disclosed above. It is to be understood that as used in the claims the terms receiver or adaptor may be construed to include structures corresponding to both the adaptor <b>16</b> and coring sleeve <b>18</b> discussed above as a single component or element of the claims.</p>
    <p num="p-0049">The coring plug <b>20</b> is sized for securement to the coring sleeve <b>18</b> and to at least cover the drain hole <b>54</b> and preferably such that the plug <b>20</b> extends across and covers a substantial portion of the bowl <b>52</b> or bowl cavity <b>53</b>. The plug <b>20</b> includes a stem or neck <b>73</b> with an external thread <b>74</b> and a cylindrical cover portion or plug head <b>75</b> which extends radially outward from the neck <b>73</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref> the plug head <b>75</b> includes a generally flat upper surface <b>76</b> that allows for unobstructed floating of the concrete slab <b>10</b> during surface finishing. The plug <b>20</b> is adapted for threaded coupling within the coring sleeve <b>18</b> with the external thread <b>74</b> of plug stem <b>73</b> engaging the internal thread <b>57</b> in the drain hole <b>54</b> of coring sleeve <b>18</b> and the plug head <b>75</b> extending within the bowl <b>52</b> of the coring sleeve <b>18</b>. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the plug <b>20</b> is sized such that when the plug <b>20</b> is threaded into the coring sleeve <b>18</b> as far as it will go the upper surface <b>76</b> of the plug <b>20</b> extends approximately flush with the upper edge of the bowl <b>52</b>. The upper surface <b>76</b> of the plug <b>20</b> is typically positioned to extend flush with the upper edge <b>67</b> of the receiver bowl <b>52</b>. It is foreseen that the plug <b>20</b> could be sized such that a peripheral edge of the plug head <b>75</b> extends just over the upper edge <b>67</b> of the receiver bowl <b>52</b>. The inner surface of the coring sleeve annular wall <b>63</b> is preferably smooth to facilitate rotation of the plug head <b>75</b> relative thereto upon threading of the plug stem <b>73</b> into the neck <b>51</b> of the coring sleeve <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0050">Because the coring sleeve <b>18</b> is designed to be left in the concrete after it hardens, the thickness of the annular wall <b>63</b> of coring sleeve bowl <b>52</b> is sized to present a relatively small thickness which is only minimally visible after installation of a drain <b>5</b> or other fixture in the coring sleeve <b>18</b>. However the annular wall <b>63</b> proximate the upper edge <b>67</b> needs sufficient thickness for structural integrity and to prevent presenting an unnecessarily sharp edge. Although not shown, the upper edge <b>67</b> is formed with a slight radius. The thickness of the annular wall <b>63</b> just below the radius is preferably approximately twenty-five thousandths of an inch. Forming the annular wall <b>63</b> to have a thickness of up to 50 thousandths of an inch or even one tenth of an inch will still result in an appearance which is believed to be acceptable.</p>
    <p num="p-0051">Because the annular wall <b>63</b> is designed to be relatively thin near the upper edge <b>67</b> of the bowl <b>52</b>, it is important to provide lateral support for the annular wall <b>63</b> during the steps of pouring and finishing the concrete slab <b>10</b> and allowing it to harden, to maintain the circular geometry of the annular wall <b>63</b>. If the annular wall <b>63</b> becomes deformed it may make it difficult to remove the plug <b>20</b>. An outer edge of the upper portion of the plug <b>20</b> extending from the upper surface <b>76</b> thereof downward at least a short distance is sized to extend in abutting relationship with an inner surface of the bowl annular wall <b>63</b> when the plug <b>20</b> is screwed all the way down into the coring sleeve <b>18</b>. The outer edge of the upper portion of the plug <b>20</b> thereby provides structural support for the annular wall <b>63</b> of bowl <b>52</b>. In addition, although not shown in the drawings, the outer edge of the upper portion of the plug tapers slightly inward and downward while the inner surface of the bowl annular wall <b>63</b> near upper edge <b>67</b> also tapers inward and downward such that the abutting edges of the plug <b>20</b> and annular wall <b>63</b> form a generally watertight seal when the plug head <b>75</b> is drawn down into the coring sleeve bowl <b>52</b> due to the wedging action of the inwardly sloped outer surface of the plug <b>20</b> against the correspondingly sloped inner surface of the bowl wall <b>63</b>. The seal acts to resist leaking of the liquid portion of the cement mixture into the coring sleeve <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0052">A tool receiver such as slot <b>78</b> is formed in the plug head <b>75</b>. The slot <b>78</b> is sized for receiving a tool (not shown) typically carried by plumbers, such as the ends of channel lock pliers. The tool is then used to provide leverage to facilitate unscrewing and removal of the plug <b>20</b> for replacement with a drain <b>5</b> as discussed hereafter. In a preferred embodiment, a thin adhesive backed sticker <b>79</b> is applied to the upper surface <b>76</b> of the plug <b>20</b> to cover the slot <b>78</b>. The sticker prevents concrete from filling the slot <b>78</b> during the steps of pouring and surface finishing of the slab. After the slab hardens sufficiently, the sticker <b>79</b> can be removed or punched through with the tool to provide access to the slot <b>78</b> for the tool.</p>
    <p num="p-0053">The sticker <b>79</b> is sufficiently thin such that it does not appreciably add to the height of the plug <b>20</b>. Although not shown, the sticker <b>79</b> may be circular and include instructions for use of the rough-in assembly, markings to locate the slot <b>78</b> and spaces for users to mark on the sticker. If a sticker <b>79</b> is not used, the slot <b>78</b> typically becomes filled with concrete during the steps of pouring and surface finishing of the slab <b>10</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The size of the slot <b>78</b> is intended to facilitate the ready removal of hardened concrete therefrom by using a screwdriver, knife, blade or other suitable tool.</p>
    <p num="p-0054">The plug <b>20</b> is designed to be left in place after the concrete slab hardens and while the surrounding structure is constructed to prevent damage to the more expensive drain <b>5</b> or cleanout during construction. To this end, the plug <b>20</b> is preferably formed of resilient material such as plastic that is capable of withstanding impact and pressure from construction materials or equipment falling onto or rolling over the cover portion <b>75</b>. In addition, a plastic composition typically provides for ready release of concrete hardened in the slot <b>78</b>. Plastics known in the art such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), and blends and copolymers thereof, may be selected for construction of the plug <b>20</b>. Polyethylene is particularly well adapted for use in forming the plug <b>20</b> due to its waxy, self lubricating type properties that facilitates insertion and removal of the plug from the coring sleeve <b>18</b>. the coring sleeve <b>18</b> and adaptor <b>16</b> are preferably formed from acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene. As an alternative to the sticker, the upper surface <b>76</b> of the plug <b>20</b> may include a textured portion <b>80</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, for receiving printed or written indicia.</p>
    <p num="p-0055"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross sectional view of the rough-in assembly of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref> when assembled and surrounded by a poured concrete slab <b>10</b>. The process or method for installing a drain <b>5</b> and connecting it to a vertically extending drain pipe <b>7</b> in association with pouring a slab <b>10</b> using the rough-in assembly <b>1</b> may be described as follows. The components of the rough-in assembly <b>1</b> are preferably assembled prior to attachment to a drain pipe <b>7</b>. In particular, the coring sleeve <b>18</b> is threaded onto the adaptor <b>16</b> and the plug <b>20</b> is threaded onto the coring sleeve <b>18</b> such that the upper surface <b>76</b> of the plug <b>20</b> generally extends flush with the upper edge <b>67</b> of the receiver bowl <b>52</b>. Typically, the plug <b>20</b> is screwed downward until a lower portion of the plug head <b>75</b> abuts the inner surface of the bowl <b>52</b>. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the plug <b>20</b> engaged with the coring sleeve <b>18</b> so that a bottom edge of the plug head <b>75</b> rests upon the annular flange <b>61</b> of the bowl <b>52</b>. The plug <b>20</b> is preferably sized such that when the bottom edge of the plug head <b>75</b> rests upon annular flange <b>61</b>, the upper surface <b>76</b> of the plug <b>20</b> generally extends flush with the upper edge <b>67</b> of the receiver bowl <b>52</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0056">The hub <b>44</b> of the adaptor <b>16</b> is then slipped over the upper end of the drain pipe <b>7</b> and secured thereto using a solvent-based cement typically applied previously to the outside surface of the drain pipe <b>7</b> and the inside surface of the adaptor <b>16</b>. The adaptor <b>16</b> should be oriented so that the trap primer port <b>49</b>, if any, is oriented in an appropriate direction to align with a trap primer pipe <b>84</b>. The level to which the upper edge of the assembly <b>1</b> (i.e. the upper edge <b>67</b> of the bowl <b>52</b> and/or the upper surface <b>76</b> of the plug <b>20</b>) extends is adjusted by threadingly rotating the coring sleeve <b>18</b> relative to the adaptor <b>16</b> to generally match or adjust it to be even with the level to which the concrete slab <b>10</b> is to be poured. The height of the upper edge of the assembly <b>1</b> is typically adjusted to a level at which no portion of the plug <b>20</b> or coring sleeve <b>18</b> extends above the level to which the concrete is to be poured and finished in forming the slab <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0057">Concrete is then poured and finished flush with the level of the upper edge of the assembly <b>1</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the concrete forming the slab <b>10</b> is poured and finished to be coplanar with the upper surface <b>76</b> of the plug <b>20</b> and the upper edge <b>67</b> of the bowl <b>52</b>. The upper surface <b>76</b> of the plug <b>20</b> may provide a reference point for use in finishing the concrete to the desired level surrounding the rough-in assembly. The level to which the concrete is poured may be adjusted to include a depression or recess in the floor surface surrounding the drain <b>5</b> to facilitate draining water into the drain <b>5</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0058">After the concrete sets, the plug <b>20</b> is removed from the bowl cavity <b>53</b> which now provides a void in the concrete slab <b>10</b> as formed by the bowl <b>52</b> of the coring sleeve <b>18</b>. As discussed above, the bowl cavity <b>53</b> is sized to receive the drain head <b>25</b> with the drain stem <b>34</b> extending in threaded engagement into the drain hole or bore <b>57</b> extending through the neck <b>51</b> of the coring sleeve <b>18</b>. The plug <b>20</b> is removed by first punching a tool through the sticker <b>79</b> and advancing the tool into the slot <b>78</b>, then rotating the tool <b>78</b> to unscrew the plug <b>20</b> from the coring sleeve <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0059">A drain <b>5</b> is then installed within the coring sleeve <b>18</b>, as generally shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, by threading the threaded neck <b>34</b> of the drain <b>5</b> into the internal thread <b>57</b> in the drain hole <b>54</b> of the coring sleeve <b>18</b>. The drain <b>5</b> is threaded into the coring sleeve <b>18</b> until the upper surface of the drain <b>5</b> is positioned at the desired level, which might be flush with the level of the concrete slab <b>10</b> or a set distance above the slab <b>10</b> to accommodate the addition of a layer of tile or the like. Subsequent adjustment of the height of the drain <b>5</b> may be made by rotation of the drain <b>5</b> relative to the coring sleeve <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0060">If the top of the drain <b>5</b> is to be coplanar with the concrete slab <b>10</b>, the drain <b>5</b> is screwed downward, typically clockwise, until it is wholly within the bowl <b>52</b> of the coring sleeve <b>18</b> (assuming the top edge of the bowl is flush with the slab). If flooring is installed above the slab <b>10</b>, the drain <b>5</b> may be unscrewed, typically rotated counter-clockwise, so that it is raised to the level of the flooring (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). The depth of the bowl cavity <b>53</b> is preferably greater than the thickness of the drain head <b>25</b> to permit the top of the drain <b>5</b> to be positioned below the upper edge <b>67</b> of the bowl <b>52</b> in case the bowl upper edge <b>67</b> extends above the level to which the concrete is poured and finished. Any portion of the bowl <b>52</b> extending above the concrete surface can then be cut away. Silicone or some other form of adhesive, cement or binder may be applied to the external thread <b>74</b> on the neck <b>73</b> of plug <b>20</b> to fix the relative position of the drain <b>5</b> to the coring sleeve <b>18</b> once the desired level of the drain <b>5</b> is obtained and once the silicone or other adhesive sets. Any gap between the drain head <b>25</b> and the receiver bowl <b>52</b> may be filled with grout or the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0061"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a perspective view of the floor drain installation assembly <b>1</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, installed and following the pouring and setting of an associated concrete floor slab <b>10</b>, with portions of the surrounding slab <b>10</b> broken away to reveal system components. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an environmental, perspective view of an installed floor drain <b>5</b> showing the drain head grate <b>27</b>, drain head collar <b>30</b> and receiver bowl upper edge <b>67</b> flush with the upper surface of the slab <b>10</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> provides a cross sectional view taken along line <b>7</b>-<b>7</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> of the drain <b>5</b> in its final position within the coring sleeve <b>18</b> after removal of the plug <b>20</b> and insertion of the drain <b>5</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0062"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref> <i>a </i>to <b>8</b> <i>j </i>show several embodiments of a leveling shim <b>90</b> which may be used to level the drain head strainer <b>27</b> or the strainer <b>27</b> and collar <b>30</b> in situations where the drain pipe <b>7</b> and rough-in assembly <b>1</b> are not installed truly vertical, for example as is generally shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Referring first to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref> <i>a </i>to <b>8</b> <i>g</i>, several embodiments of the leveling shim <b>90</b> are shown in top and side view with the various embodiments designated <b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b </i>and <b>90</b> <i>c</i>. An alternative embodiment of a leveling shim <b>91</b> is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref> <i>h</i>-<i>j</i>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, when the drain pipe <b>7</b>, adaptor <b>16</b> and coring sleeve <b>18</b> are in a substantially vertical orientation, the strainer <b>27</b> of the drain <b>5</b> attached thereto extends in a substantially horizontal alignment simply through coupling of the drain <b>5</b> to the coring sleeve <b>18</b>. When the drain pipe <b>7</b>, and attached adaptor <b>16</b> and coring sleeve <b>18</b> deviate from a vertical orientation, however, the horizontal orientation of the strainer <b>27</b> will deviate correspondingly. It may be necessary or desirable, therefore, to cant or tilt the strainer <b>27</b> or the strainer <b>27</b> and collar <b>30</b> relative to the rest of the drain <b>5</b> to obtain an orientation of the strainer <b>27</b> that is closer to horizontal.</p>
    <p num="p-0063">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the left edge of the strainer <b>27</b> has been raised by placing the thickest portion of a shim <b>90</b>, such as shim <b>90</b> <i>b</i>, between the side of the strainer <b>27</b> needing to be raised (the left side in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) and the underlying portion of the drain head collar <b>30</b>, thereby placing the strainer <b>27</b> in a generally horizontal orientation relatively flush with the surrounding upper surface of the slab <b>10</b>. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a shim, such as shim <b>91</b>, may be positioned immediately below the collar <b>30</b> and above the drain head flange <b>36</b> to level both the collar <b>30</b> and the grate <b>27</b> (or clean out cover) relative to the finished surface of the slab <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0064">Each of the shims <b>90</b> <i>a</i>-<i>c </i>is generally annular or ring-shaped. Shim <b>90</b> <i>a</i>, for example, forms a complete ring that tapers in height when viewed from the side as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> <i>b</i>, from a relatively thick side <b>92</b> <i>a </i>(the left edge in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> <i>b</i>) to a relatively thin opposing side <b>93</b> <i>a </i>(the right edge in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> <i>b</i>). As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the placement of one or more shims <b>90</b> <i>a </i>between the collar <b>30</b> and grate <b>27</b> may be used to tilt the grate into the desired position. A series of ridges <b>94</b> <i>a </i>and grooves <b>96</b> <i>a </i>is preferably formed on the upper and lower surfaces of each shim <b>90</b> <i>a </i>to facilitate holding, in a selected orientation, a pair of shims <b>90</b> <i>a </i>stacked on top of each other (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> <i>g</i>). The ridges <b>94</b> <i>a </i>and grooves <b>96</b> <i>a </i>on adjacent shims <b>90</b> <i>a </i>interlock to prevent one shim <b>90</b> <i>a </i>from sliding or rotating relative to the other shim <b>90</b> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0065">Shim <b>90</b> <i>b </i>is semi-annular, instead of completely annular as in shim <b>90</b> <i>a</i>, with an opening or gap <b>98</b> <i>b </i>formed between opposed ends <b>99</b> <i>b </i>of the semi-annular shim <b>90</b> <i>b</i>. Shim <b>90</b> <i>b </i>is also tapered from a thick side <b>92</b> <i>b</i>, opposite the gap <b>98</b> <i>b</i>, to a thin side <b>93</b> <i>b </i>adjacent the opening or gap <b>98</b> <i>b</i>. A significant advantage of semi-annular shim <b>90</b> <i>b </i>over shim <b>90</b> <i>a </i>is that the gap <b>98</b> <i>b </i>provides the user with a visual reference as to which side is the thick side <b>92</b> <i>b </i>and which side is the thin side <b>93</b> <i>b</i>. Shim <b>90</b> <i>b </i>presents a further advantage over shim <b>90</b> <i>a </i>in that it may be installed around screws <b>37</b> already engaged between the strainer <b>27</b> and the drain head collar <b>30</b>. Shim <b>90</b> <i>c </i>presents a further embodiment having a larger gap <b>98</b> <i>c </i>and a consistent thickness. Shims <b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b </i>and <b>90</b> <i>c</i>, and related embodiments that may occur to one skilled in the art by this disclosure, may be used in multiples or in combination to achieve the desired orientation and positioning of the grate <b>27</b>. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> <i>g </i>shows a pair of shims <b>90</b> <i>b </i>stacked on top of each other to increase the angle that the shims <b>90</b> <i>b </i>will offset the grate <b>27</b> relative to the drain head collar <b>30</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0066">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref> <i>h </i>to <b>8</b> <i>j</i>, another embodiment of a leveling shim <b>91</b> is shown having a scalloped interior wall <b>91</b> <i>a </i>comprising alternating ridges <b>91</b> <i>b </i>and troughs <b>91</b> <i>c</i>. The troughs <b>91</b> <i>c </i>provide spaces for screws <b>29</b> to pass through from the strainer <b>27</b> to the drain head flange <b>36</b> and assist in holding the shim <b>91</b> in place and in keeping it from sliding out of position during assembly of the drain <b>5</b>. When viewed from the side, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> <i>j</i>, it may be seen that the shim tapers from a relatively thick portion <b>9</b> <i>d</i>, to a relatively thin portion <b>91</b> <i>e </i>so that the strainer <b>27</b> and collar <b>30</b> can be titled relative to the drain head flange <b>36</b> to level the strainer <b>27</b> and collar <b>30</b> with the surrounding floor surface.</p>
    <p num="p-0067">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, when the rough-in assembly does not extend truly vertical, a portion of the receiver bowl <b>52</b> annular wall <b>63</b> may extend above the level of the finished slab <b>10</b>. To avoid potential interference with foot traffic or overlying floor structures or treatments, the projecting portion <b>67</b> <i>b </i>may be trimmed off with a knife or other device, particularly if the coring sleeve <b>18</b> is formed of plastic. In addition, the drain <b>5</b> may be lowered within the coring sleeve <b>18</b> to avoid projection of the right edge of the grate <b>27</b> above the slab surface <b>10</b>. As discussed previously, the bowl <b>52</b> preferably is deeper than the thickness of the drain head <b>25</b> to provide sufficient space for receiving the drain head <b>25</b> completely within the bowl <b>52</b> even if a portion of the bowl <b>52</b> must be trimmed away.</p>
    <p num="p-0068">Turning to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 through 14</figref>, an alternative embodiment of the floor drain mounting assembly is indicated by reference numeral <b>101</b> and shown in cross-section in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. The assembly <b>101</b> includes a drain receiver <b>118</b> which mounts directly to the drain pipe <b>7</b> and a concrete coring cap <b>120</b> threadably engaged within the receiver <b>118</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0069">The receiver <b>118</b> presents a hollow, cylindrical body <b>125</b> with a mounting hub <b>128</b> formed in a lower end thereof, an internal thread <b>130</b> formed in an upper end thereof and a flange <b>132</b> extending radially outward and upward from the upper end of the cylindrical body <b>125</b>. The mounting hub <b>128</b> is sized for relatively snug securement over the end of the drain pipe <b>7</b>. An upper end of the hub <b>128</b> is defined by an annular shoulder or stop <b>134</b> formed on the inner surface of the receiver body <b>125</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0070">The cap <b>120</b>, as shown in detail in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12</figref>, includes a threaded stem or neck <b>138</b> and a bowl <b>140</b> formed at an upper end of the stem <b>138</b> and projecting radially outward therefrom. The neck <b>138</b> is of a reduced diameter relative to the bowl <b>140</b> and is sized for receipt within the upper end of the receiver body <b>125</b> and through threaded engagement with the internal thread <b>130</b>. Radially extending dividers <b>142</b> extend across the interior of the bowl <b>140</b> providing strength and rigidity and dividing the bowl <b>140</b> into a plurality of pie shaped sections or chambers <b>144</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0071">In use, the coring cap <b>120</b> may be preloaded onto the receiver <b>118</b>. The receiver <b>118</b> is then slid onto and secured to the drain line <b>7</b> by cementing it thereto. The cap <b>120</b> may be secured to the receiver <b>118</b> such that a floor <b>146</b> of the cap <b>120</b> abuts against the receiver flange <b>132</b> and an outer wall <b>147</b> of the cap projects upward therefrom. Once the receiver <b>118</b> is secured to the drain line <b>7</b>, the cap <b>120</b> may be rotated relative to the receiver <b>118</b> to adjust the level of the upper edge of the cap <b>120</b> to correspond to the level to which the concrete slab <b>10</b> is to be finished. An O-ring <b>148</b> may be placed around the cap stem <b>138</b> to form an air-tight seal between the cap <b>120</b> and the receiver <b>118</b> permitting pressure testing of the drain line prior to installation of the drain <b>5</b>. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the cap <b>120</b> may include a notch <b>149</b> or other means for securing the O-ring <b>148</b> to the surface of the stem <b>138</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0072">After pressure testing of the drain line <b>7</b> and assembly <b>101</b>, concrete is poured around the assembly <b>101</b> and finished to the desired level to form the slab <b>10</b>. During pouring, concrete enters the pie-shaped chambers <b>144</b> of the bowl <b>140</b> so that once the concrete hardens, the filled cap <b>120</b> presents a continuous surface over which wheeled vehicles, carts or the like may readily traverse or roll during the construction of the remaining portions of the structure on top of the slab <b>10</b>. Once construction is complete, and it is desired to install the drain <b>5</b>, the concrete is first removed from the pie shaped chambers <b>144</b> of cap <b>120</b> with a screw driver or the like and possibly by first breaking the concrete in the cap <b>120</b> into smaller pieces. After the concrete is removed from the pie shaped sections <b>144</b> of cap <b>120</b>, an end of a tool may be inserted into the cap <b>120</b> to provide leverage to unscrew and free the cap <b>120</b> from the surrounding concrete. A release material may be applied to or wrapped around an outer surface of the cap <b>120</b>, to facilitate release of the cap <b>120</b> from the concrete slab <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0073">Removal of the cap <b>120</b> from the receiver <b>118</b> leaves a bowl-shaped void or recess <b>152</b> in the concrete slab <b>10</b>, sized to receive a drain <b>5</b>. The drain <b>5</b> is secured to the receiver <b>118</b> by threading the neck <b>34</b> of the drain <b>5</b> into the receiver <b>118</b> and onto internal thread <b>130</b>. The level of the drain <b>5</b> can then be adjusted by rotating the drain <b>5</b> up or down within the receiver <b>118</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0074"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a cross sectional view of the floor drain installation system illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> with a drain <b>5</b> partially engaged with the receiver <b>118</b>. It should be appreciated that the drain <b>5</b> may positioned relative to the receiver <b>118</b> such that an upper surface of the drain <b>5</b> is spaced a selected distance <b>154</b> above the surface of the slab <b>10</b> so that the drain head upper surface will extend flush with the surface of flooring material to be installed on top of the slab <b>10</b>. The upper surface of the flooring material is represented by line <b>156</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Alternatively, the drain <b>5</b> may be further engaged with the receiver <b>118</b>, typically by rotating the drain <b>5</b> clockwise, until the drain <b>5</b> is held within the void <b>152</b> and the upper surface of grate <b>27</b> is flush with the surface of the slab <b>10</b>. As is also seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the receiver flange <b>132</b> functions to direct any water flowing between the drain <b>5</b> and the slab <b>10</b> back into the drain coring sleeve <b>18</b> and to the drain line <b>7</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0075"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 through 17</figref> illustrate alternative embodiments of certain components of the floor drain installation system as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates components engaged with a drain pipe <b>7</b> prior to pouring a concrete slab <b>10</b> including an adaptor <b>160</b> that is connected to the upper end of the drain pipe <b>7</b>, a coring sleeve <b>18</b> connected to the upper portion of the adaptor <b>160</b>, and a slightly modified version of the plug <b>20</b> removably connected to the upper portion of the coring sleeve <b>18</b> to close off the internal passage or bore that runs through the coring sleeve <b>18</b>, adaptor <b>160</b> and drain pipe <b>7</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0076">The adaptor <b>160</b>, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, is illustrated in further detail in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> includes a generally cylindrical body <b>162</b> with an internal bore <b>164</b> therethrough and an internal wall <b>166</b>. A lower portion of the adaptor <b>160</b> generally comprises a smooth-walled hub <b>168</b> sized for external engagement over a drain pipe <b>7</b> in a manner similar to that described previously for adaptor <b>16</b>. A channel <b>170</b> around the exterior circumference of the body <b>162</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>) divides the hub <b>168</b> from the upper portion <b>172</b> of the adaptor <b>160</b> and is coincident with a ridge or internal shoulder <b>174</b> formed within the bore <b>164</b>. The shoulder <b>174</b> defines the upper end of the hub <b>168</b> and includes internal threads <b>176</b> for engagement with auxiliary plumbing fixtures or other devices. The lower surface of the shoulder <b>174</b> acts as a stop against the end of the drain pipe <b>7</b> as the adaptor <b>160</b> is slid onto and in engagement with the drain pipe <b>7</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0077">An internal thread <b>178</b> formed in the upper portion <b>172</b> of the adaptor <b>160</b> may be used for connecting the coring sleeve <b>18</b> to the adaptor <b>160</b>. A lip <b>173</b> projecting radially outward from the upper end of the upper portion <b>172</b> presents an upward facing horizontal surface that may contact the lower surface of the annular flange <b>61</b> of the coring sleeve <b>18</b> to form a seal. The seal may be augmented by applying caulk to the upper surface of the lip <b>173</b> prior to tightening the coring sleeve <b>18</b> flange <b>60</b> against the lip <b>173</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0078">A trap primer port <b>182</b> is located in the wall of the upper portion <b>172</b> so that the drain pipe <b>7</b> may be sealed separately from the primer port <b>182</b> through engagement of a threaded plug (not shown) with the internal threads <b>176</b> on the shoulder <b>174</b>. Through this configuration, the drain system may be pressure tested apart from, and without the need for sealing, the primer port <b>182</b> and any associated plumbing pipe leading to the port <b>182</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0079"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the adaptor <b>190</b> similar the adaptor <b>160</b> described above. The adaptor <b>190</b> includes a generally cylindrical body <b>192</b> with an internal bore <b>194</b> therethrough and an internal wall <b>196</b>. The lower portion of the adaptor <b>190</b> comprises a smooth-walled hub <b>198</b>. The adaptor <b>190</b> differs from adaptor <b>160</b> in that the hub <b>198</b> is sized for internal, rather than external, engagement within a drain pipe <b>7</b>. Alternatively, the hub <b>198</b> could be used to externally engage a drain pipe <b>7</b> having a relatively small external diameter.</p>
    <p num="p-0080">Due to the reduced diameter of the hub <b>198</b> relative to the middle portion <b>202</b>, an exterior shoulder <b>212</b> is formed that, in a manner similar to that of internal shoulder <b>174</b> in adaptor <b>160</b>, acts as a stop to limit travel of the drain pipe <b>7</b> when engaged with the adaptor <b>190</b>. As the hub <b>198</b> is slid inside a drain pipe <b>7</b> the end of the drain pipe <b>7</b> will come to abut the shoulder <b>212</b> at the point of full engagement.</p>
    <p num="p-0081">Because the lower portion or hub <b>198</b> is reduced in diameter from middle portion <b>202</b>, however, a shoulder surface is not created in the interior of the adaptor <b>190</b> at the interface or juncture of the hub <b>198</b> and middle portion <b>202</b>, as with adaptor <b>160</b>. Therefore, to provide such a surface should the adaptor <b>190</b> be required to fit over a drain pipe <b>7</b> with a smaller diameter than the bore <b>194</b> within the hub <b>198</b>, an internal shoulder <b>214</b> may be provided as a ridge projecting vertically and inwardly from the upper interior wall of the hub <b>198</b> into the bore <b>196</b> to provide a stop to prevent further upward passage of the drain pipe <b>7</b> within the adaptor <b>190</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0082">A further embodiment of the assembly, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, includes a flashing drain or shower pan drain adaptor <b>220</b> in place of the adaptor <b>160</b> in the assembly shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. The adaptor <b>220</b> is generally cylindrical and includes an internal bore <b>222</b> therethrough. The adaptor <b>220</b> differs from the embodiments disclosed above in that the upper end of the adaptor <b>220</b> is surrounded by an extended flange or pan <b>224</b> that projects outward and upward. The lower portion of the adaptor <b>220</b> includes a hub <b>226</b>, similar in design to those disclosed above, for engagement with the drain line <b>7</b>. A trap primer port <b>228</b> may be included in the upper portion of the adaptor <b>220</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0083">A clamping ring <b>230</b> is provided for clamping and securing flashing (not shown) between ring <b>230</b> and the pan <b>224</b>. Flashing may thereby held in place by the adaptor <b>220</b> during pouring of a surrounding concrete floor slab. The flashing assists in capturing water or other liquid that seeps downward along the exterior of the drain assembly <b>5</b> and directing it into the drain pipe <b>7</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0084"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref> provide enlarged illustrations of the clamping ring <b>230</b>. The ring <b>230</b> includes a generally horizontal flange <b>232</b> projecting radially outward from a generally cylindrical base <b>234</b> having a bore <b>236</b> therethrough. The internal wall of the ring <b>230</b> includes threads <b>238</b> that, in the illustrated embodiment, are divided into segments or sections separated by open spaces <b>240</b>. Due to the arrangement of these segments and open spaces <b>240</b>, a fitting, such as an adaptor <b>160</b>, with external threads divided into segments having an arcuate length corresponding to the arcuate length of the open spaces may simply be lowered into the body of the clamping ring <b>230</b> to the desired depth and then turned to engage threads on the fitting with corresponding threads <b>238</b> in the ring <b>230</b>. This greatly speeds assembly of a fitting with the disclosed ring <b>230</b> since multiple turns of the fitting are not normally required to bring it into full engagement with the ring <b>230</b>. Rather, after lowering the fitting into the ring <b>230</b>, less than a full turn of the fitting is normally required to attain full engagement.</p>
    <p num="p-0085">To facilitate attachment of the clamping ring <b>230</b> to the adaptor <b>220</b> as generally shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, holes <b>242</b> are provided in the clamping ring flange <b>232</b> that may be aligned with corresponding threaded holes <b>229</b> in the flange <b>224</b> of the adaptor <b>220</b>. After the ring <b>230</b> is placed so that the base <b>234</b> fits within the bore <b>222</b> of the adaptor <b>220</b>, threaded screws <b>244</b> are passed through holes <b>242</b> and then tightened to threaded engagement within holes <b>229</b>. The ring <b>230</b> may be turned slightly, to engage each screw <b>244</b> with the narrowed, slot portion <b>243</b> of each corresponding clamping ring hole <b>242</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0086">Turning to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 22</figref>, the plug <b>20</b> illustrated differs from the previously described plug <b>20</b> in that the threads <b>74</b> are non-contiguous but project in spaced sections about the neck of the plug to offer less frictional resistance when the plug <b>20</b> is later removed (unscrewed) from the coring sleeve <b>18</b>. In addition, the coring sleeve <b>18</b> may be provided with correspondingly segmented threads so that the plug <b>20</b> can be inserted fully into the coring sleeve <b>18</b> by passing the threads <b>74</b> of the plug <b>20</b> past spaces between receiver thread segments (not shown), the plug <b>20</b> then being tightened in place typically without having to turn the plug <b>20</b> more than a full turn. Rigid, spaced partitions or webbing <b>185</b> on the underside of the plug <b>20</b> enhance the overall strength and rigidity of the plug <b>20</b> while minimizing weight.</p>
    <p num="p-0087"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is a top plan view of the plug <b>20</b> engaged within the coring sleeve <b>18</b> as further illustrated in cross section along lines <b>24</b>-<b>24</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> the coring sleeve <b>18</b> is shown in full engagement with adaptor <b>190</b> and the plug <b>20</b> is shown in full engagement with the coring sleeve <b>18</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is a top plan view of the drain assembly <b>5</b> engaged within the coring sleeve <b>18</b> as further illustrated in the cross sectional view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> taken along lines <b>26</b>-<b>26</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> the coring sleeve <b>18</b> is shown in full engagement with adaptor <b>160</b> and the drain assembly <b>5</b> is shown engaged within the coring sleeve <b>18</b> so that the strainer <b>27</b> is level with the upper lip <b>67</b> of the coring sleeve <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0088"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> illustrates several further variations of the invention including a solid coring cap or plug <b>250</b>, cast or shaped from plastic or other appropriate material, an adaptor <b>260</b>, similar in design to adaptors <b>160</b> and <b>190</b>, a coring sleeve <b>280</b> having a relatively vertical annular wall <b>282</b>, and a coring insert <b>300</b> that may be threadably engaged within the coring sleeve <b>280</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0089">As shown, the adaptor <b>260</b> includes a smooth-walled hub <b>262</b> in the lower portion of the adaptor <b>260</b>, a middle portion having internal threads <b>264</b> for engagement with a plug or other fixture (not shown), and an upper bowl <b>266</b> having internal threads <b>268</b> sized to mesh with the external threads <b>283</b> of the coring sleeve <b>280</b>. As illustrated, a trap primer port <b>270</b> is provided in the wall of the upper bowl <b>266</b>. A flange <b>272</b> projects outward from the top edge of the bowl <b>266</b> to contact the coring sleeve <b>280</b> when the coring sleeve <b>280</b> is in full engagement with the adaptor <b>260</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0090">The coring sleeve <b>280</b> is similar in construction and function to the previously described embodiment of a coring sleeve <b>18</b>. The exterior surface of the upper portion <b>284</b> of the wall <b>282</b> drafts or tapers inward as it approaches the upper edge of the wall <b>282</b>. In a manner similar to coring sleeve <b>18</b>, this inward draft causes the coring sleeve <b>280</b> to be “locked” into position once is poured around the coring sleeve <b>280</b> and allowed to harden.</p>
    <p num="p-0091">The coring insert <b>300</b> has external threads <b>302</b> about a lower, generally cylindrical base <b>304</b> that engage with internal threads <b>286</b> that run along the interior wall of the coring sleeve <b>280</b>. The coring insert <b>300</b> has an upper bowl portion <b>306</b> that comprises an annular wall <b>308</b>, the bowl being sized to accept the plug <b>250</b>. The coring plug <b>250</b> sets within the coring insert <b>300</b> so that an outer portion <b>252</b> of the plug <b>250</b> overlies the upper edge of the wall <b>308</b>. After a surrounding concrete floor slab has been poured and allowed to harden, the coring plug <b>250</b> and coring insert are removed and replaced with a drain assembly <b>5</b> or other plumbing fixture.</p>
    <p num="p-0092"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 and 29</figref> illustrate an alternative embodiment in which the coring plug <b>20</b> is replaced by a relatively thin, flat, circular or disc shaped cover <b>320</b> attached to either the coring sleeve <b>18</b> or, as illustrated, to the drain <b>5</b>. The drain <b>5</b> may therefore be installed within the coring sleeve <b>18</b> prior to pouring the surrounding floor slab <b>10</b>. As illustrated, the cover <b>320</b> may be attached to the drain <b>5</b> by passing screws <b>29</b> through holes provided in the cover <b>320</b> and then threading the screws <b>29</b> through the grate <b>27</b> and into the drain head flange <b>25</b>. Small, circular stickers <b>322</b> may then be affixed over the heads of the screws to protect them during pouring and finishing of the slab <b>10</b> and more specifically to keep concrete out of the screwdriver receiving grooves in the heads of the screws <b>29</b>. After the slab <b>10</b> has hardened sufficiently, the stickers <b>322</b> are peeled off, the screws <b>29</b> are removed, the cover <b>320</b> is removed and saved for reuse or discarded, the screws <b>29</b> are re-threaded into the grate <b>27</b> and drain head flange <b>25</b> to secure the drain head <b>5</b> elements to one another, and the drain <b>5</b> is rotated relative to the coring sleeve <b>18</b> so as to raise the drain <b>5</b> to a desired level relative to the coring sleeve <b>18</b> and/or floor surface.</p>
    <p num="p-0093">The cover <b>320</b> is typically a thin plastic disk having a diameter equal to or slightly less than that of the top opening of the bowl cavity <b>53</b> in the coring sleeve <b>18</b>. The cover <b>320</b> preferably extends across substantially the entire bowl cavity <b>53</b> to engage or extend in close proximity to an inner surface of the coring sleeve <b>18</b> along the upper edge <b>67</b> of the bowl cavity <b>52</b> to prevent concrete or cement from passing between the cover <b>320</b> and the rim <b>67</b> of the coring sleeve <b>18</b>. Typically, the cover <b>320</b> will have a thickness of between 1/10 and ¼ inches. As with the coring plug <b>20</b>, a portion of the top surface of the cover <b>320</b> may be textured to accept ink or pencil markings or such indicia may be printed on a sticker adhered to the cover <b>320</b>. The screws <b>29</b> used to hold the cover <b>320</b> in place may be the same, typically metal, screws <b>29</b> used to attach the grate <b>27</b> to the drain head flange <b>25</b>. Alternatively, plastic screws may be provided to attach the cover <b>320</b> to the drain head flange <b>25</b>. The plastic screws are then replaced by the metal screws when the cover <b>320</b> is removed and the grate <b>27</b> is secured to the drain head flange <b>25</b>. As further alternatives, the cover <b>320</b> may be attached directly to the grate <b>27</b> using adhesive, double faced tape, or the cover <b>320</b> may be constructed to snap in place within or over the receiver rim <b>67</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0094">As an alternative embodiment of the cover <b>320</b>, one large, typically circular, piece of adhesive backed plastic film (not shown) may be applied over the grate <b>27</b> to extend past the juncture of the grate <b>27</b> and receiver rim <b>67</b>, thereby protecting the grate <b>27</b> and coring sleeve <b>18</b> from concrete slurry infiltration during pouring and finishing of the floor slab <b>10</b>. As with the cover <b>320</b> and coring plug <b>20</b>, a portion of the top surface of the film may be textured to accept ink or pencil markings.</p>
    <p num="p-0095">The coring plug <b>20</b> generally functions as an inexpensive substitute for a drain head or clean out to occupy or cover the space defined by the bowl cavity <b>53</b> during the concrete pouring and finishing steps. The plug thereby keeps concrete out of the bowl cavity <b>53</b>. The diameter of the plug head <b>75</b> closely approximates the diameter of the fixture to be inserted in the bowl cavity <b>53</b>. The plug head <b>75</b> is preferably as thick as the depth of the bowl cavity <b>53</b> such that a lower edge of the plug head <b>75</b> engages the upper surface of the flange <b>61</b> of the coring sleeve <b>18</b> to provide structural, generally load bearing support so that the plug does not break when heavy loads are moved across the upper surface of the plug <b>20</b> after the slab <b>10</b> has set.</p>
    <p num="p-0096">As shown in the drawings, the threads for connecting the plug <b>20</b> to the coring sleeve <b>18</b> and the coring sleeve <b>18</b> to adaptor <b>16</b>, such as threads <b>47</b>, <b>55</b>, <b>57</b> and <b>74</b> as well as the threads <b>35</b> on the stem <b>34</b> of the drain <b>5</b> adapted for use with the rough-in assembly <b>1</b> are preferably a square cut type thread. The square cut threads facilitate the draining of water down through the assembly and into the bore of drain pipe <b>7</b>. The square threads also tend to facilitate relatively easy threading of one component relative to the other and are relatively durable.</p>
    <p num="p-0097">It is to be understood that while certain forms of this invention have been illustrated and described, it is not limited thereto except insofar as such limitations are included in the following claims and allowable equivalents thereof. It is also to be understood that in any method claims set forth herein, unless specified otherwise in the claims, the steps of the method do not necessarily have to occur in the order set forth.</p>
