A unitary power module is used as a propulsion system, which includes a target sprocket and a mounting frame, with the target sprocket comprising a disk shaped assembly having an center opening to allow the unitary member to be placed about the wheel axle. The target sprocket mates to the hub (or axle) of either of the wheels to enable target sprocket to be concentrically attached to the wheel by engagement with the wheel by securing elements. The mounting frame may be aligned with and rotatably attached to the target sprocket to allow for aligned rotation of the target sprocket about the wheel axle. The mounting frame may be attached to the unitary member by a bearing or the like and has an opening to receive an electric motor having a pinion sprocket to enable the pinion sprocket to engage the target sprocket to rotate the rear wheel upon application by the rider of propulsion controls. A free wheel clutch may be provided on the unitary power module or target sprocket to allow the wheel to rotate faster than the motor without motor drag.</div>

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention relates to an electric motor bicycle, and more particularly to a unitary self-contained direct drive power module (or “unitary power module”) for electric bicycles or other vehicles. The invention also includes a kit for converting a standard bicycle into an electric bicycle by use of the unitary power module.</p>
    <p>By way of background information, and turning now to the drawings, FIG. <b>19</b>(<i>a</i>) illustrates a standard bicycle <b>100</b> (“or bicycle”), which is a two wheeled vehicle comprised typically of a front steering wheel <b>102</b> and a rear wheel <b>104</b>, which may be attached to the frame by quick-disconnect units <b>105</b>. The standard bicycle <b>100</b> includes a frame assembly <b>106</b> having a head tube <b>108</b> which journals a front fork <b>110</b> for steering via handle bars <b>109</b> by a rider of the bicycle <b>100</b>. As illustrated in FIG. <b>19</b>(<i>b</i>), the rear wheel <b>104</b> is journalled at the rear end of the frame <b>106</b> by a pair of rear stays (or “dropouts”) <b>112</b>. A seat tube <b>111</b> is carried by the frame <b>106</b> adjacent the rear wheel <b>104</b> and a seat post <b>113</b> upon which a saddle type seat <b>115</b> is positioned thereon to accommodate a rider.</p>
    <p>In the standard bicycle <b>100</b>, a horizontally oriented journal (or crank journal) <b>117</b> is positioned beneath the seat tube <b>111</b> which supports a rider “propelled” drive mechanism <b>120</b>. The drive mechanism <b>120</b> generally comprises a crank <b>123</b> journalled in the crank journal <b>117</b>, which includes a chain sprocket <b>129</b> having a plurality of teeth, together with the crank <b>123</b> positioned therein with along with pedals <b>125</b> rotatably journalled at each end <b>127</b> of the crank <b>123</b>.</p>
    <p>Each wheel typically consists of a tire <b>114</b> mounted on a rigid rim <b>116</b>, an axle <b>118</b>, a hub mechanism (or “hub”) <b>122</b> and spokes <b>124</b> connecting the rigid rim <b>116</b> to the hub <b>122</b> to form an axle/hub assembly <b>121</b>. The hub <b>122</b> surrounds the axle <b>118</b> and is free to rotate about the axle <b>118</b> through a bearing assembly <b>126</b> (not shown). The tire/rim assembly <b>128</b> is attached to the hub <b>122</b> through an assembly of the spokes <b>124</b> which are assembled in a woven pattern <b>130</b> to form a wheel/hub assembly <b>140</b>. This woven pattern <b>130</b> of spokes has relatively few variations with a large quantity of existing bicycle wheels being common in using the same or similar thirty-six or thirty-four spoke weave pattern <b>130</b>. A target “chain” sprocket <b>150</b> is mounted about the rear wheel <b>104</b>, and is connected to the crank sprocket <b>129</b> by a chain <b>152</b> whereby application of power by the rider on the pedals <b>125</b> propels the bicycle <b>100</b>. A derailleur <b>154</b> is often substituted for the single target sprocket <b>150</b> (or target sprocket), and may have a plurality of sprockets <b>156</b>, <b>158</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> and <b>166</b> (illustrated in FIG. 9) to provide variable gearing for rider comfort when either starting or climbing hills or for rider efficiency.</p>
    <p>One of the features of a bicycle, is the ability of the wheel to be removed for servicing, such as repairing a flat. As described above, the typical bicycle wheel is constructed of a tire/rim assembly connected to the hub through a series of woven spokes. The hub rides on the axle of the wheel using a bearing assembly. The axle/hub assembly typically has rather loose manufacturing tolerances and as such provides a poor reference frame for the propulsion elements of prior systems. This occurs because bicycles are typically high rate, low-cost, manufactured consumer products, whereby the tolerances of components are not as high as a high quality mechanism. The majority of bicycles sold in the world and in use are in the lower or looser tolerance ranges. Also, when the wheel (or tire) is repaired and then replaced in the dropouts of the frame, the axle can become slightly cocked with respect to the frame. As such, tolerances for the mounting slots of the wheel axle allow for a wide latitude of assembly. The loose manufacturing tolerances of the axle and axle/hub bearings is typical of such low-cost mechanisms. These large tolerances of wheel and bicycle frame components present a significant problem in the design of reliable direct drive propulsion systems where various components of the system are mounted on different parts of the bicycle (e.g., on the frame, on the axle, etc.)</p>
    <p>If the various components of the propulsion system are mounted on bicycle components, which have loose tolerances in reference to each other, then the propulsion system suffers (or will suffer) from these same poor alignment tolerances with rough usage. In order to avoid excessive wear, reduced efficiency, and reduced performance as a result of such loose tolerances, an effective propulsion system should ideally utilize a design which is independent of such loose tolerances in the axle/hub assembly of the bicycle as well as the changing tolerances relative to the frame. It is this design concept which forms this invention.</p>
    <p>In the past, electric propulsion systems for bicycles have been implemented through a variety of methods which utilized electric motor power to either supplement or replace the above rider drive mechanism in propelling the bicycle. For example, these methods include friction roller drives, belt drives, gear drives, and chain drives. For example, friction drives typically involve the application of an electric motor or “the drive source” to a wheel or “the target mechanism” through a roller mechanism. The roller may be directly attached to the drive source or through a clutch mechanism. The roller transfers the drive source energy through the contact of the roller on the target wheel through friction between their respective surfaces. This type of drive system suffers from mechanical losses associated with slippage between the roller mechanism and the target wheel as a result of reduced friction and from the energy required to compress the rubber tire. Performance in moisture, rain, snow and mud is marginal at best.</p>
    <p>By way of further example, electric bicycles having direct drive systems, such as belt, gear and chain drives typically provide higher energy coupling efficiencies than the roller friction drive systems. These systems however require a high degree of mechanical integrity in the geometry of drive components. For instance, there needs to be sufficient tension in the belt and chain of the belt and chain drive systems and the proper alignment or meshing of the gears in the gear drive system. Proper and exact mechanical alignment must be maintained rigidly with shock and many tire and wheel repairs in order to extend the life of the unit.</p>
    <p>There have been a number of designs, which can provide direct coupling between an electric motor(s) mounted externally to the rear bicycle wheel and the axle of the wheel. For example, a motor can be mounted either on the diagonal or horizontal rear members (or “stays”) of the frame. A direct coupling in these cases can be effected through a 90-degree bevel gear between a shaft from the motor and the axle-hub assembly. In this case, external shocks will cause gear wear. Further, it is difficult to remove the rear wheel for repair. The drive can be effected through a chain, which is better but still mechanically complex and subject to the same kind of problems. It is also difficult to achieve the right reduction ratios between the RPM of typical motors and that of the rear wheel, typically between 10:1 and 25:1. A motor can be mounted above the rear wheel and drive a very large “sprocket” of diameter almost as large as the wheel diameter. Such systems have been demonstrated but have not been accepted because they are clumsy, top-heavy and subject to relative dislocation of the elements.</p>
    <p>Other direct drives have been reduced to practice with the motor mounted in the neighborhood of the pedal crank. These can be coupled to the rear wheel by a gear drive with suitable clutches within the crank housing and thence through the usual bicycle chain or through a separate long chain to a separate sprocket on the rear wheel. They can also be coupled to the rear wheel through long shafts and bevel gears. While some of these are workable and practical, they require a special custom bicycle design, which may be more expensive than desired.</p>
    <p>For designs in which a motor mounted externally to the rear wheel, an improvement is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,934,401 entitled “Precision Direct Drive Mechanism for a Power Assist Apparatus for a Bicycle,” by Mayer et al. filed on Feb. 20, 1997. In this concept, as depicted in FIGS. 20-23, a motor is mounted on a plate, which is separately indexed to the axle of the rear wheel. The motor drives a pinion gear (or pinion sprocket) which drives through meshed gears, a chain or a belt a target gear (or sprocket) that is separately indexed to the axle of the rear wheel, and is attached to the axle through a bearing or free-wheel clutch arrangement. That is, the motor-pinion assembly with its mounting frame and the target gear (or sprocket) are separately indexed off the axle, with the target gear (sprocket) actually indexed from the hub.</p>
    <p>Thus, these elements in a benign environment are accurately aligned with respect one another, all being indexed from presumably common and concentric points. However, even with this improved and more compact configuration, we have found in practice that for most bicycles, the axle bearing tolerances and the hub bearing tolerances are highly variable with real world rough usage and shocks. In more detail, if the mesh between the pinion sprocket (or gear) and the target sprocket (or gear) occurs at a long leverage arm from the axle, the looseness of the bearings can change the pinion/target gear meshing or alignment, leading to eventual gear wear, tooth breakage, or misalignments of such sprockets. Additional concerns are the difficulty of achieving the alignment of shafts (such as the shafts of the motor, or the target wheel) and the manufactured tolerances of components over time and with normal rough usage.</p>
    <p>Another class of direct drive systems are based on “hub motors” which are designed into the wheel hubs of front or rear wheels. This class of drives has its own cost considerations and performance characteristics.</p>
    <p>None of the above described electric bicycle drive propulsion systems provides the important advantages of the inventive unitary power module for an electric bicycle propulsion system which has a high degree of mechanical integrity in the alignment geometry of the drive components even under shock and rough usage. These advantages are achieved by uniquely configuring the unitary power module having drive components comprising a drive source (or an electric motor), a pinion drive coupling component (such as a chain sprocket, gear or pulley pinion or combination thereof), a target mechanism coupling component (or a chain sprocket, driven gear, or belt sprocket), the actual mechanical coupling mechanism to the target or target wheel, and the target or driven wheel, itself, which is the normally the rear wheel. By use of various sprocket ratios, the invention may achieve a wide-range of gear ratios and therefore adaptability to a wide range of motors. Also, by the use of a free-wheel clutch incorporated into the unitary power module, the bicycle is completely free wheeling with virtually no drag in the absence of applied power. Still further, when in production, the unitary power module can be assembled and tested as an integral operating unit, and then be easily and simply attached to the bicycle frame.</p>
    <p>Specifically, the present invention achieves these advantages by utilizing a unitary power module having mounting frame assembly on which all propulsion elements are mounted and aligned with a wheel fitting (or “drive”) coupler, which is a disk shaped assembly with a large center opening allowing the target coupler to be placed about a wheel axle outside of the hub diameter. In the preferred embodiment, the target coupler has a groove pattern mating the woven spoke pattern of a bicycle wheel to enable the target coupler to be concentrically attached to the target wheel by engagement with the woven spoke pattern by securing elements. The mounting frame is attached to the target coupler by a bearing or the like, including a free wheel clutch. The mounting plate has an opening (or “element”) to receive an electric motor to enable a pinion sprocket or gear affixed on the motor to engage the sprocket and through a chain to the target sprocket (or gear) to rotate the target bicycle wheel upon suitable power application by a rider via propulsion controls on the bicycle.</p>
    <p>Thus, the present invention provides the advantages of having a separate independent self-contained (and self-aligned) unitary power module which overcomes misalignment problems between the drive source and the target by using a common reference frame. The integrity of the chain alignment or gear mesh is thereby permanently ensured even in rough terrain and rough shock and usage. This invention can thus be advantageously implemented by using a chain drive, gear drive or belt drive system because one of its important advantages is its inherent avoidance of the usual misalignment causes by the above prior art devices. It has the additional advantage of being easily installed on almost any bicycle rear wheel by an unique and separately described mechanical coupler. It works efficiently, essentially independent of frame and axle/hub assembly and wheel/hub tolerances.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>According to the invention, a unitary power module for mounting a propulsion system on a bicycle comprises a mounting frame having a motor and a target sprocket integrally mounted on the mounting frame. The target sprocket defines a disk shaped member having a center opening to allow the drive sprocket to be placed about a wheel axle of the bicycle. The drive sprocket mates with a bicycle wheel through a clutch and target coupler to enable the sprocket to be mounted substantially concentrically to an axle of the wheel by engagement with a wheel pattern of the bicycle by securing elements. The mounting frame is rotatably attached to the target sprocket to allow for “aligned” rotation of the target sprocket about the wheel axle, and proper alignment with an electric motor. The mounting frame has an element to receive an electric motor to enable a pinion sprocket affixed to the motor to propel the target sprocket and rotate the bicycle wheel. In the manner, the mounting frame provides a single point of reference for aligning the pinion sprocket with the target sprocket, i.e., thereby allowing the unitary power module to operate by itself, for example on a bench, independent of the bicycle per se.</p>
    <p>In another embodiment of the invention, a propulsion system kit is provided for converting a standard bicycle having a frame and front and rear wheel, with the rear wheel having an axle and hub together with a wheel pattern into an electric bicycle. The kit comprises a battery suitable to be affixed to the bicycle, an electric motor having a pinion sprocket (or gear) affixed thereon, with the electric motor suitable to be connected to the battery by a battery cable. A unitary member comprises a target sprocket, a mounting frame and gear reduction or chain mechanisms which are precisely aligned with each other. The target coupler sprocket comprises a disk shaped assembly having an center opening to allow the unitary member to be placed around the axle outside the hub.

The mounting frame provides a single point of reference for aligning the pinion sprocket with the target sprocket.</p>
    <p>In yet another preferred embodiment, an electric bicycle comprises a frame having a rider seat and propulsion controls positioned and thereon. The bicycle includes a steerable front wheel having an axle affixed to a front portion of the frame, and a rear wheel having an axle with a pattern affixed to a rear portion of the frame. A propulsion system for the bicycle comprises a battery affixed to the bicycle, and an electric motor having a driver affixed thereon, the electric motor suitable to be connected to the battery by a battery cable. A unitary power module for mounting a propulsion system on the bicycle comprises a target sprocket defining a disk shaped member having a center opening to allow the target sprocket to be placed about a wheel axle of the bicycle. The target sprocket mates with a bicycle through a wheel coupler to enable the target coupler to be substantially concentrically attached to the wheel by engagement with the wheel pattern by securing elements. A mounting frame is aligned and rotatably attached to the target sprocket to allow for aligned rotation of the target sprocket with the driver about the wheel axle and has an opening to receive the electric motor to enable the driver affixed on the motor to engage a second sprocket positioned on a shaft. The second sprocket shaft is disposed to engage the target sprocket to propel the target sprocket and rotate the bicycle wheel upon application by a rider of propulsion controls positioned on the bicycle.

    <p>Preferably, the above embodiments having the second sprocket and shaft include a third sprocket concentrically mounted upon with the second shaft, with the driver rotating the second sprocket, which in turn rotates the third sprocket which is positioned to engage the target sprocket.</p>
    <p>In more detail, and by way of example, the target sprocket is preferably attached to the mounting frame by a bearing. Further, a one way clutch is affixed between the pinion sprocket and the motor.</p>
    <p>Still further, the target coupler (or target sprocket) may include a groove pattern disposed to mate a woven spoke pattern of the bicycle wheel, or simply mate with a hub positioned on the bicycle wheel.</p>
    <p>Further, the pinion sprocket may engage the target sprocket (or second sprocket and third sprocket as appropriate, by either the target sprocket and driver each having a plurality of teeth suitable to be connected in power engagement a drive chain; or each having a plurality of gear teeth suitable to be engaged by one another, or each having a surface suitable to be engaged by a drive belt.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the electric motor may quickly be engaged or released from the mounting frame by a series of quick release tabs, together with connecting or disconnecting the motor shaft with a unitary power module shaft by using gears or spline connections.</p>
    <p>According to the invention, a disk shaped member for an electric bicycle propulsion system preferably comprises a target sprocket comprising a disk shaped assembly having an center opening to allow target sprocket member to be placed about a wheel axle, and woven spoke pattern which allows the target sprocket to mate the woven spoke pattern of a wheel to enable the sprocket to be concentrically attached to the wheel outside the hub diameter by engagement by securing elements.</p>

The target sprocket is securable to a bicycle wheel and securable to the mounting frame about a bearing affixed about the second opening.</p>
    <p>As pointed out in greater detail below, the embodiments of this invention provides a number of significant advantages. For example, the key points of the invention include the establishment of a common reference or mounting frame and structure which assures precision alignment for the entire propulsion system under all conditions. This reference frame is formed by the disk or target sprocket along with the hollow extension collar and grooved surface. This disk provides a solid mounting attachment with the wheel through the grooved surface mating with the wheel hub and spokes. The disk is held concentric with the wheel hub, but great eccentricity accuracy is not required. The sprocket gear is attached to the reference frame disk through either a freewheeling clutch or directly attached to the reference frame disk. The motor mounting frame is attached to the reference frame disk through a bearing on the hollow extension collar of the disk. The motor is attached to the motor mounting frame, in such a way as to provide for proper meshing of the driven and target sprocket, independent of axle and hub bearing tolerances. The driver sprocket (or gear) is attached to the motor either directly, or through a one-way roller clutch, depending on whether the driven (or sprocket) gear has a freewheeling clutch. In this manner, the pinion sprocket, target sprocket and any intermediate gears are precisely aligned irrespective whether they are interconnected by a chain, a gear, or a belt. The motor mounting frame is clamped to the bicycle frame to prevent rotation of the mounting frame, i.e., to transmit propulsion torque to the bicycle.</p>
    <p>The invention holds the entire propulsion system within the same reference frame, thereby constraining the propulsion system tolerances within the propulsion system. These tolerances are determined by the manufacturing tolerances of the propulsion system components as designed independent of the vehicle manufacturing tolerances. This allows the propulsion system to be applied to any vehicle, while maintaining the integrity and performance of the propulsion system. The invention itself, together with further objects and attendant advantages, will best be understood by reference to the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Referring now to FIGS. 1-3, a key aspect of the unitary power module <b>200</b> (or “unitary propulsion module”) concerns the providing of a one frame of reference to align a pinion sprocket to a target sprocket. This is accomplished by using a “mounting frame” <b>204</b> of the unitary power module <b>200</b> to accurately align a pinion sprocket <b>242</b> of an electric motor <b>230</b> to the wheel/hub assembly <b>140</b> (shown in FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>19</b>). As all drive and target elements of the unitary power module are mounted to the mounting frame <b>204</b>, a single integral and independent point of reference assures their proper alignment. The attachment of the mounting frame <b>204</b> to the hub/spoke assembly <b>140</b> (and to the bicycle frame) allows for a stable reference frame, since the wheel/hub assembly <b>140</b> is attached directly to the tire/rim assembly <b>128</b> of the wheel <b>104</b> (which is the target drive mechanism of the unitary power module <b>200</b>). As described hereinafter, this reference frame eliminates the loose or varying tolerances of the wheel/hub assembly <b>140</b> and the tire/rim assembly <b>128</b> and the axle <b>118</b> and frame assembly <b>106</b>, thereby providing rigid alignment of the drive and target elements of the unitary power module <b>200</b> even with the attendant shock and wear incumbent in such drive systems.</p>
    <p>Turning now to FIG. 1, in one of the preferred embodiments of the invention, the mounting frame <b>204</b> is connected to a motor having a pinion sprocket <b>242</b> mounted thereon which is interconnected via a chain <b>211</b> to a target sprocket <b>202</b> with a target coupler <b>203</b> having a pattern <b>205</b> (shown in FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>)) which matches the woven spoke pattern <b>130</b> of the bicycle wheel (shown FIG. <b>19</b>). An idler sprocket (or gear or pulley or “idler”) <b>288</b> may be used to provide tension between a chain <b>211</b> to ensure engagement between the pinion sprocket <b>242</b> and the target sprocket <b>202</b>. The idler <b>288</b> can also be used to allow the chain <b>211</b> to engage more teeth of the pinion sprocket <b>242</b> and thus permit closer spacing between the pinion sprocket <b>242</b> and the target sprocket. The mounting frame <b>204</b>, when attached directly to the target sprocket <b>202</b> through a bearing <b>206</b>, such as a ring bearing, allows the reference frame of the target sprocket <b>202</b> to freely rotate within acceptable tolerances while maintaining its mechanical attachment to the mounting frame <b>204</b>. Further, the mounting frame <b>204</b> includes a motor opening <b>224</b> shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 (or other mechanical element for attachment) for a motor <b>230</b> to be positioned thereon.</p>
    <p>FIG. 2 illustrates the position of the motor <b>230</b> having a motor shaft <b>244</b> which engages a planetary gear <b>246</b> suitable for gear reduction, such as from 5:1 or 7:1 RPM reduction. By use of a this important configuration, the planetary gear reduction system between the motor shaft <b>244</b> and pinion sprocket <b>242</b> enables the user to select the preferred overall RPM ratio between motor and bicycle wheel, which can be adjusted over a wide range of high values. The planetary gear <b>246</b> in turn engages the pinion sprocket <b>242</b>, which is interconnected by a chain to the target sprocket. This simple configuration will be the least cost of certain applications. The overall reduction ratio between the RPM of the motor <b>230</b> and the RPM of bicycle wheel <b>104</b> is easily adjusted by the ratio of diameters or number of teeth between the pinion sprocket <b>242</b> and target sprocket <b>202</b>. A quick-disconnect <b>500</b> for the motor <b>230</b> is provided by providing a spline <b>245</b> on the motor shaft <b>244</b> attaching to the input of the planetary gear system <b>246</b>. Of course, in a still simpler configuration the planetary gear reduction is not needed. For example, the motor <b>230</b> may connect directly to the pinion sprocket and the overall RPM ration between the motor <b>203</b> and the drive wheel <b>104</b> (not shown) is smaller. In this case, a lower RPM motor is necessary.</p>
    <p>As further illustrated in FIG. 3, the mounting frame <b>204</b> receives the motor <b>230</b> having its motor shaft <b>244</b> perpendicular to mounting frame <b>204</b>. Through the mechanism such as illustrated in FIG. 1, the motor <b>230</b> is suitable to provide power to the pinion sprocket <b>242</b>. The target sprocket <b>202</b> is affixed to a hollow extension collar (or rotating tube) <b>207</b> or the like, which is interconnected a target coupler <b>203</b>, which engages the spokes <b>124</b> of the bicycle wheel <b>104</b> about the hub <b>122</b> but mounts to the spokes <b>124</b> outside of the hub <b>122</b>. The target coupler <b>203</b> has the same wheel spoke pattern <b>205</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>c</i>), to mate the wheel spoke pattern <b>205</b> of the bicycle wheel <b>104</b> shown in FIG. <b>8</b>. The inner diameter of this whole assembly is made large enough to fit over virtually all types of hubs <b>122</b>. The coupler fastens to the spokes and spreads the torque across typically 16 or 18 spokes at their strongest point. This target coupler <b>203</b> is rigidly connected to (or part of) the rotating tube <b>207</b>, which can rotate with respect to the mounting frame <b>204</b> because of the ring bearing <b>206</b>. Thus, as described, the invention provided a common point of reference for the various components of the direct drive system, which allows tolerances to be controlled within the propulsion drive system, as well as isolated from the tolerances of the bicycle components. Merely by way of example, the target sprocket <b>202</b> and target coupler <b>203</b> (or “criss-cross coupler”) may be constructed of either aluminum or engineered plastic which can be molded, and the mounting frame <b>204</b> is preferably aluminum, both for light weight and relatively high thermal conductivity for the purpose of dissipating motor heat.</p>
    <p>As pointed out above, the target sprocket <b>202</b>, which preferably is driven by a chain <b>211</b> from the pinion sprocket <b>242</b>, is mounted through a freewheeling clutch <b>277</b> proximate to the rotating tube <b>207</b>. The free wheel clutch allows the wheel to spin freely without the drag of the electric motor <b>230</b>, when the electric motor is not being powered. This free wheel clutch <b>277</b> significantly reduces wheel drag, a discernible effect to the bicycle rider, and improves the range of the bicycle. The free wheel clutch <b>277</b> can be implemented as a roller clutch or “freewheel” on the pinion sprocket gear or as a free wheel clutch on the target sprocket. In this manner, when the target sprocket rotates faster than the rear wheel, it engages and drives the wheel. When coasting with the motor off, the free-wheel allows the rear wheel to rotate with the target sprocket <b>202</b> disengaged.</p>
    <p>A suitable “freewheel” or “one-way roller” clutches which may be incorporated into the unitary power module <b>200</b> is a Dicta Brand Freewheel manufactured by Lida Machinery Co., Ltd., Tao Yuan, Taiwan, and is a freewheel which employs pawls in the clutch. It is positioned in the target sprocket, which drives the rear wheel. It is incorporated into the gear or sprocket and is concentric with the wheel axle as part of the mechanism. Another suitable unit is a roller clutch made by Torrington, Inc. of Connecticut which can be incorporated on the intermediate shaft on which is mounted two sprockets in the two-stage gear reduction configuration. As described hereinafter, there are several methods for implementing a one-way clutch feature for the propulsion system, e.g., one possible way would be to put a roller clutch between the motor and pinion gear. An alternate mechanization would be to put a freewheeling clutch between the wheel and the target sprocket or gear. If the freewheeling clutch is placed between the wheel and driven gear, then the freewheeling clutch would attach to the hollow extension collar of the reference frame disk already described. Otherwise, if a one-way clutch is implemented between the motor and pinion gear the driven gear would be directly and firmly attached to the disk and hollow extension collar.</p>
    <p>As illustrated, a ring bearing <b>206</b> allows the mounting frame to rotate around a tube, which can rotate. The rotating tube <b>207</b> is rigidly attached to the target coupler <b>203</b> (or spoke coupler or target coupler, which as illustrated is a disk shaped member which is circular with the tube <b>207</b> (or a hollow collar) in the center. The bearing <b>206</b> attaches to and interconnects the target sprocket <b>202</b> having the hollow collar <b>207</b> at a centrally positioned opening <b>208</b> of the target sprocket <b>202</b> and an opening <b>210</b> of the mounting frame <b>204</b>, which are concentric to one another. The target coupler <b>203</b> that drives the bicycle wheel is a disk shaped member having the central opening <b>208</b> and an outside and inside surface <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>. In this embodiment, the target sprocket <b>202</b> includes a plurality of chain teeth <b>216</b> suitable to engage the chain <b>211</b>. The hollow collar <b>207</b> allows clearance of the axle of the wheel <b>104</b>. The free-wheel clutch (or “free wheel”) can also be mounted as before described or either on the target sprocket-coupler mechanism or the output shaft of the planetary gears <b>246</b>.</p>
    <p>The target sprocket <b>202</b> is mounted about the rotating tube <b>207</b> by the freewheeling (“free wheel”) or the one-way clutch <b>277</b>. The free-wheel <b>277</b> can be mounted on the motor shaft <b>244</b> between the pinion sprocket <b>242</b> and the motor shaft <b>244</b>. As illustrated, when the motor <b>230</b> is off and the shaft is stationary, the pinion sprocket <b>242</b> can rotate along with the chain <b>211</b>. The rotating tube <b>207</b> is precisely mounted to the mounting frame <b>204</b> by a ring bearing <b>206</b> or the like concentric with the rear axle. The mounting frame <b>204</b> is mounted to the bicycle frame <b>106</b> by suitable securing elements <b>235</b>, as shown in FIGS. 14, <b>15</b>. For example, as may be understood from FIGS. 14 and 15, the quick disconnect (or “quick-disconnect clamp”) may affix the mounting frame <b>204</b> to the bicycle frame <b>106</b> (via either the horizontal or diagonal rear stays <b>112</b>) in lieu of securing element <b>235</b>. In this manner, the torque from the propulsion system is transmitted to the rear wheels, which of course, eliminates any rotation between the mounting frame <b>204</b> and the bicycle frame <b>106</b>. When the motor <b>230</b> is off, the target sprocket <b>202</b> is stationary and the tube-coupler-bicycle wheel can rotate because of the action of the free-wheel <b>277</b>. When the motor <b>230</b> is on, i.e., the target sprocket <b>202</b> is rotating faster than the coupler-bicycle wheel, the free wheel <b>277</b> engages and the target sprocket <b>202</b> drives the tube-coupler-bicycle wheel assembly.</p>
    <p>As described in FIGS. 1-3, the entire unitary power module <b>200</b> is totally independent of the bicycle per se as it can be operated by itself, e.g., on a bench. The mounting frame provides and maintains rigid alignment of the complete propulsion module independent of bicycle-hub-axle tolerances. The unitary power module, when attached to the spokes, can even be somewhat off-center with respect to the axle with little noticeable effect. Further, as shown in FIGS. 14 and 15, the unitary power module <b>200</b> may be attached to the frame by the quick-disconnect <b>234</b> to assure easy repair or replacement of a tire or the module itself.</p>
    <p>Turning now to FIGS. <b>4</b>(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), the invention may be practiced when the target coupler <b>203</b> and target sprocket <b>202</b> are formed in an integral unit. Further as illustrated in FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>b</i>), a belt <b>278</b>, such as a “V” belt <b>278</b> may be used rather than a chain to interconnect the pinion sprocket <b>242</b> and target sprocket <b>202</b>. As illustrated, a “V” groove <b>284</b> is formed in both the pinion sprocket <b>242</b> and target sprocket <b>202</b> (and idler sprocket <b>288</b>) to receive the “V” belt. Similarly, the target sprocket <b>202</b> defines a similar surface groove <b>286</b> to receive a “V” belt <b>278</b> or the like. Other forms of belt configurations may readily be used by modifying the pinion sprocket <b>242</b> and target sprocket <b>204</b> to receive such belts <b>278</b>.</p>
    <p>Merely by way of illustration, FIGS. <b>5</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>) show another embodiment of the unitary power module <b>200</b> suitable for using meshed gears (with the pinion gear in phantom lines) when viewed from the “outside” of the bicycle <b>100</b>. Meshed gears, in contrast to a chain and sprocket, have the advantage of being very compact and may function very well with this rigid alignment concept of the mounting frame <b>204</b>. In this embodiment, the pinion sprocket <b>242</b> (shown in a phantom line) or pinion pulley must be located closer radially towards the axle hole so that appropriate engagement is maintained between a pinion gear and the target sprocket. Also, the motor rotates in the opposite direction to that for the chain drive. As described, the mounting frame <b>204</b> and target sprocket <b>202</b>, which are aligned together with a free wheel clutch <b>277</b> placed therebetween. The mounting frame <b>204</b> is mounted to the target sprocket <b>202</b>, though an opening <b>210</b> in the mounting frame <b>204</b>, by way of an attachment to a hollow extension tube <b>207</b> or collar <b>207</b> (“tube <b>207</b>”) of the target sprocket <b>202</b>, which is mounted to the bicycle wheel <b>104</b>, as described below. A projection <b>209</b> may be formed on the mounting plate <b>204</b> to secure the mounting plate <b>204</b> via a clamp or the like to the frame assembly (not shown).</p>
    <p>Turning to FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>), the inside surface <b>214</b> (not shown) of the other side of the target sprocket <b>202</b> includes an annular region <b>218</b> positioned generally concentric on the target sprocket opening <b>208</b>. The annular region <b>218</b> includes a plurality of crossed slots <b>220</b>, which fit the spoke pattern of a standard bicycle wheel (e.g., such as the common configuration of 36 spokes or 34 spokes, half on each end of hub <b>122</b>). A plurality of tapped holes <b>222</b> are spaced around the annular region <b>218</b> which serve the purpose of receiving screws (not shown) to fasten the target coupler <b>203</b> to the wheel spokes <b>124</b>. Alternatively, studs (not shown) may take the place of holes which match a plate (not shown, but illustrated in FIG. <b>6</b>((<i>b</i>)). The mounting frame <b>204</b> defines a second opening <b>224</b> to receive an electric motor (not shown). As illustrated in phantom lines, the pinion sprocket <b>242</b> (S<b>1</b>) is positioned to engage the target sprocket <b>202</b>. An enlarged view of the annular target coupler pattern suitable to engage the spokes <b>124</b> of a 36 spoke 3 cross wheel pattern of a bicycle wheel is shown in FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>c</i>). As illustrated, the target coupler <b>203</b> includes crossed slots <b>224</b> are formed to receive the spokes <b>124</b> of the bicycle wheel thereby providing a firm mechanical coupling of the target coupler <b>203</b> to the bicycle wheel (not shown).</p>
    <p>While FIGS. <b>5</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>) illustrate a meshed gear drive system, a chain drive system as described above would involve only moving the pinion sprocket away from the sprocket <b>202</b> and use teeth rather that the gears on the target sprocket <b>202</b>. As described above, the motor in a chain drive would rotate the opposite direction than a meshed gear drive to impart the same rotational direction to the bicycle wheel.</p>
    <p>As illustrated in FIG. <b>6</b>(<i>a</i>), the unitary power module <b>200</b> is shown as having an electric motor (or motor) <b>230</b> as it would look from “outside” of the bicycle wheel if it were attached to the wheel (not shown). A suitable electric motor <b>230</b> for use with this invention is a brushless dc motor having a R.P.M. operational speed from about 3000 R.P.M. to about 4000 R.P.M. along with integral control electronics. Brush motors of a wide variety can also be used. Other motors with a wide range of operational RPM's can be employed with the various reduction mechanisms taught herein. The motor <b>230</b> has an electrical cable <b>232</b> suitable to plug into a module connector <b>231</b> for interconnection to a battery. As illustrated above, the target sprocket <b>202</b> is mounted on the mounting frame <b>204</b> in the second opening <b>224</b> provided therein. The large diameter of the opening <b>210</b> in the mounting frame <b>204</b> is suitable for it to slip over the entire wheel/hub assembly <b>140</b>. The motor <b>230</b> may be quickly attached to the mounting frame <b>204</b> by quick release tabs <b>234</b>, and may be quickly removed by rotation of the tabs <b>234</b> or other similar quick disconnect fasteners. As illustrated, the pinion sprocket <b>242</b> is coupled by the chain <b>211</b> with the target sprocket <b>202</b>.</p>
    <p>In this manner, the motor <b>230</b> can be quickly removed or replaced merely by releasing the tabs <b>234</b> and disconnect the electrical cable <b>232</b> from the module connector <b>231</b> within the motor <b>230</b>. Turning now to FIG. <b>6</b>(<i>b</i>), the target sprocket <b>202</b> is mounted on the opposite side of the mounting frame <b>204</b> from the motor side. Since this is an integral “unitary power module,” the pinion sprocket <b>242</b> (“S<b>1</b>”) and target sprocket <b>204</b> (or “S<b>4</b>”) remain perfectly meshed or aligned with each other whether or not the module is exactly concentrically attached to the bicycle wheel <b>104</b> and independent of any loose tolerances and changing tolerances of the hub or bearings.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, in cases where the bicycle wheel is warped or if it is otherwise in less than in a planar configuration, the alignment of the chain between the pinion sprocket <b>242</b> and target sprocket is accurately maintained. FIG. <b>6</b>(<i>b</i>) also illustrates the use of the mounting ring <b>236</b> to secure the target coupler <b>203</b> to the bicycle wheel hub <b>122</b>. The inside surface <b>214</b> of the other side of the target coupler <b>203</b> includes an annular region <b>218</b> which is concentric with the target sprocket opening <b>208</b>. The annular region has crossed slots <b>220</b> which fit the spoke pattern <b>130</b> of a standard bicycle wheel (not shown). The holes <b>222</b> are positioned in the annular region <b>218</b>. The crossed slots <b>220</b> fit the spoke pattern <b>130</b> of the bicycle wheel, such as the rear wheel of FIG. <b>19</b>.</p>
    <p>In FIG. 7, the target module <b>204</b> is shown in combination with the target sprocket <b>202</b> having the target coupler <b>203</b> (shown in phantom lines) engaging a thirty-six spoke, three cross wheel pattern of a bicycle wheel. A suitable material for construction of the target coupler <b>203</b> would be Al 6061 having a black anodize or the like, or it could be made of a plastic along with molded metal thread inserts. By precisely integrating the woven pattern <b>130</b> of a spoke wheel, the target coupler <b>203</b> provides a rugged construction suitable to receive the torque loads imposed upon the target sprocket <b>202</b>.</p>
    <p>Turning now to FIG. 8, the unitary power module <b>200</b>, with a motor <b>230</b> and pinion sprocket <b>242</b> using the chain <b>211</b> to drive the target sprocket <b>202</b>, is shown in an “outside” side view attached to a bicycle wheel <b>104</b>. The bicycle wheel <b>104</b> includes an axle <b>118</b>, a hub <b>122</b>, a plurality of spokes <b>124</b> positioned about the axle <b>118</b> (as further illustrated in FIGS. <b>16</b>(<i>a</i>)(<i>b</i>)(<i>c</i>)), and connecting to the tire/rim assembly <b>124</b>. The mounting frame <b>204</b> and target sprocket <b>202</b> are mounted around the axle <b>118</b> though the target sprocket opening <b>208</b> and plate opening <b>210</b> respectively on the target sprocket <b>202</b> and mounting frame <b>204</b>. As illustrated above, the unitary power module <b>200</b> includes a plurality of quick-release fittings, such as the tabs <b>234</b>, the motor <b>230</b> can be quickly detached from the mounting frame. When re-engaged, accurate gear alignment is automatically established. This feature provides significant advantages, as it is useful both for easy repairs (replacement) and for converting the bicycle back and forth between electric and conventional configurations. Also, a one-way roller clutch <b>240</b> can either be concentric with the target sprocket <b>202</b> and bearing <b>206</b> or it can be attached to a pinion sprocket <b>242</b> on the motor. As is apparent, this is a complete propulsion module or “kit” to convert a bicycle into an electric bicycle. That is, if voltage is applied to the motor, the motor can drive the pinion sprocket, which in turn can drive the larger target sprocket <b>202</b>, and it works as a unitary self-contained module. Further, this unitary power module <b>200</b> can be attached to the outer diameter of the bicycle wheel hub <b>122</b>. The mounting frame <b>204</b> is easily rotated around the wheel axle for any position to attach to the frame <b>106</b> which does not interfere with the bicycle frame stays <b>112</b>.</p>
    <p>As illustrated from the “inside” perspective in FIG. 9, the unitary power module <b>200</b> with the motor <b>230</b> and pinion sprocket <b>242</b>, is mounted to the bicycle wheel <b>104</b>, with the spokes <b>124</b> and the hub <b>122</b> by a mounting ring <b>236</b>. Merely for illustration, the “inside” shows a derailleur gear cluster <b>156</b>, having a plurality of sprockets <b>156</b>, <b>158</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>162</b>, <b>164</b>, and <b>166</b> suitable for manual gear adjustment. As described above, FIG. 9 shows the attachment of the target coupler <b>203</b> (or target sprocket <b>202</b>) connected or meshed with bicycle wheel <b>104</b> in the following manner. The mounting ring <b>236</b> formed by two semi-circular pieces <b>238</b>,<b>239</b> fits flush against the target sprocket <b>202</b> and secures it to be positioned to receive the spokes <b>124</b>. A plurality of screws <b>249</b> (or bolts where the holes <b>222</b> are replaced with studs) or the like, extend through the wheel spokes <b>124</b> then secure the target sprocket <b>202</b> as a unit to the bicycle wheel <b>104</b>. As a result the target sprocket <b>202</b> attaches firmly and precisely with the wheel/hub assembly of the wheel <b>104</b>. The target sprocket <b>202</b> through virtue of the grooves holds precisely to the wheel <b>104</b>, maintaining concentricity with the wheel/hub assembly, although perfect concentricity is not required. In this manner, the target sprocket <b>202</b> can rigidly be mounted to the spokes <b>124</b> of a bicycle wheel <b>104</b>. The mounting ring <b>236</b> includes a plurality of holes <b>270</b> which mate to the holes <b>222</b> of the annular region <b>218</b> of the target sprocket <b>202</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>5</b>.</p>
    <p>It is important to recognize that the unitary power module <b>200</b> is automatically centered to reasonable and practical tolerances on the axle of the bicycle <b>100</b> to a fairly close tolerance. Perfect centering is not required for perfect pinion-driven gear alignment, which is independently maintained on the unitary self-contained module. It is important to note that the plate opening <b>210</b> in the mounting frame is much larger than the wheel axle and hub diameter. Thus, the whole unit can be rotated around the axle for a convenient angular position with respect to the members of the bicycle frame <b>106</b>. The mounting frame <b>204</b> is then connected to the frame by a strap or pin <b>235</b>, as shown in FIG. 14 or a quick-disconnect clamp such a “C” clamp (not shown). This is necessary to hold the position of the unit with respect to the frame <b>106</b> and to transfer the torque to the frame. As this connection can be the quick disconnect clamp, it facilitates rapid disconnection of module <b>200</b> from the frame <b>106</b> and rapid wheel/tire repair.</p>
    <p>Turning now to FIGS. <b>10</b>(<i>a</i>), <b>10</b>(<i>b</i>) and <b>11</b>, another preferred embodiment of the unitary power module of the present invention is illustrated. In this embodiment, unitary power module includes a the target sprocket <b>202</b> (“S<b>4</b>”) defining a disk shaped member having a center opening <b>210</b> to allow the target sprocket <b>202</b> to be placed about the wheel axle <b>118</b> of the bicycle. As before, the target sprocket <b>202</b> mates with a bicycle wheel <b>104</b> to enable the target sprocket <b>202</b> to be substantially concentrically attached to the wheel by engagement the woven spoke pattern <b>130</b> by the target coupler <b>203</b> and the securing elements as described above. The mounting frame <b>204</b> is aligned with and rotatably attached to the target sprocket <b>202</b> to allow for rotation of the target sprocket <b>202</b> (“S<b>4</b>”) about the wheel axle <b>118</b>. The mounting frame <b>204</b> has an opening <b>224</b> to receive an electric motor <b>230</b> to enable a pinion sprocket <b>242</b> (“S<b>1</b>”) affixed via motor shaft <b>244</b> of the motor <b>230</b> to engage a second sprocket <b>250</b> (“S<b>2</b>”) via the chain <b>211</b>. The mounting frame <b>204</b> includes the projection <b>209</b> which enables the mounting frame <b>204</b> to be secured to the frame. The second sprocket S<b>2</b> is mounted by a second shaft <b>252</b> positioned on the mounting frame <b>204</b>, is aligned with the pinion sprocket <b>242</b>. The third sprocket <b>264</b> (“S<b>3</b>”) is also mounted on the same second shaft <b>252</b> as sprocket S<b>2</b>, and is aligned with the target sprocket <b>202</b>. The third sprocket S<b>3</b> is positioned to engage the target sprocket <b>202</b>, such as via the chain <b>276</b>, and rotate target sprocket <b>202</b> thus rotating bicycle wheel <b>104</b>.</p>
    <p>In this “2-chain” embodiment there are two sprockets, S<b>2</b> and S<b>3</b> mounted on an intermediate shaft. The motor drives pinion sprocket <b>242</b> (S<b>1</b>) through the first chain <b>211</b>. Sprocket S<b>2</b>, which is usually larger than S<b>1</b>, in turn drives S<b>3</b> and the final target sprocket <b>202</b> (S<b>4</b>) by a second chain <b>276</b>. While the sprockets S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b> are on one side of the mounting frame <b>204</b>, and sprockets S<b>3</b> and S<b>4</b> are illustrated on the other side of the mounting frame, the pair of sprockets S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b> and S<b>3</b> and S<b>4</b> can be in various positions in regard to the mounting frame <b>204</b>, e.g., S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> may be on the same side of the mounting frame <b>204</b> with S<b>3</b> and S<b>4</b>. By use of the two chain drives, the overall gear ratio can easily be adjusted by arranging the number of teeth on S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b> (or the other sprockets). Also, in a like manner, two or more belt drive systems may also be used. Accordingly, this can provide great flexibility and compactness as different motors having different costs, RPM's, etc., can be easily adapted as the power sources. As described, it is apparent that this configuration is elegant and very compact. Also, in this case, the free-wheel <b>277</b> can either be mounted concentric with the axle between the target sprocket <b>202</b> and coupler <b>203</b> or, e.g., on the intermediate shaft between S-<b>1</b> and S-<b>2</b>.</p>
    <p>In another embodiment of the invention, as illustrated in FIG. 12, the mounting frame <b>204</b> additionally may include a second opening <b>270</b> (not illustrated) suitable to receive a second electric motor <b>272</b> having a second pinion sprocket <b>274</b>. The second pinion sprocket <b>274</b> can be connected to the pinion sprocket <b>242</b> in a manner that target sprocket <b>202</b> is driven by both electric motors <b>230</b>, <b>272</b>. For example, the pinion sprocket <b>242</b> and the second pinion sprocket <b>274</b> are connectable and aligned together by a chain <b>276</b> to provide rotational power to the target sprocket. Also, one of the motors <b>230</b> may include a one-way roller clutch <b>240</b> and the other electrical motor <b>272</b> may include a roller clutch. In this manner, one motor can be shut off while the other motor is operating for level riding, however, for steeper grades the second motor can be switched on to effectively double the available power to the target sprocket and the bicycle wheel. As understood, one or more independent integral propulsion modules can be mounted to a bicycle, thus providing optimum performance of torque and efficiency at relatively low RPM.</p>
    <p>In another embodiment of the invention shown in FIG. 13, the motor <b>230</b> is mounted on mounting frame <b>204</b> in a parallel (or horizontal) position to major axis of the mounting frame <b>204</b>. By use of a pair of bevel gears <b>290</b>, <b>292</b>, power from the motor <b>230</b> is supplied to the target sprocket. By use of this configuration, a cylindrical motor <b>230</b> whose axis is parallel to the plane of the mounting frame may be used. The bevel gears <b>290</b>, <b>292</b> which transmit rotation of a shaft parallel to the mounting frame to a shaft perpendicular to the plate, can work reliably with shock and vibration because of the rigid “unitary” assembly. All other propulsion elements are the same. This provides additional ability to adapt to longer cylindrical motors rather than pancake designs. In this manner, the breadth of the motor projection can be minimized and another motor having an extended cylindrical shape can be used without having the motor projecting a substantial horizontal distance.</p>
    <p>Another embodiment of invention is shown in FIG. 14, which illustrates a kit <b>299</b> for converting a standard bicycle (shown in phantom lines) to an electric bicycle, which is easily connected and disconnected from any bicycle. It permits simple dropping of the rear wheel for wheel and tire repair. By use of this kit, the unitary power module can be easily mounted or attached to the outside diameter (“O.D.”) of a bicycle wheel hub, fitting virtually any bicycle and transforming it quickly into a high-performance electric bicycle. In more detail, the propulsion system kit is provided for converting a standard bicycle having a frame <b>106</b> and the front wheel <b>102</b> and the rear wheel <b>104</b>, with the rear wheel <b>104</b> having an axle <b>118</b> and hub <b>122</b> together with a wheel pattern (or woven pattern) <b>130</b> into an electric bicycle. The kit <b>299</b> comprises a battery <b>300</b> suitable to be affixed to the bicycle <b>100</b>, an electric motor <b>230</b> having a pinion sprocket gear <b>242</b> affixed thereon, with the electric motor <b>230</b> suitable to be connected to the battery <b>300</b> by a battery cable <b>232</b>. Propulsion controls <b>328</b> are attached to the handlebars <b>109</b> for speed control. These components together with the above unitary member <b>200</b>, and all of the above described components comprises the “kit,” which can convert any standard bicycle into a high performance electric bicycle.</p>
    <p>Also, as illustrated in FIG. 14 (and FIGS. <b>6</b>(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), and FIG. 8 above), the kit <b>299</b> provides the components of the unitary power module <b>200</b>, including the electric motor <b>230</b> which attaches to the mounting frame <b>204</b>. The attachment of the motor <b>230</b> allows for the pinion gear <b>242</b> to properly mesh with the target sprocket <b>202</b> affixed to wheel of any standard bicycle by the target coupler <b>203</b>, independent of axle bearing and hub bearing tolerances. A mounting frame clamp <b>235</b> is attached to the projection <b>209</b> of motor mounting frame <b>204</b>, to prevent the motor <b>230</b> and mounting frame <b>204</b> from rotating about the frame assembly <b>106</b> and thus provide a stable mounting point for the unitary power module. Alternatively, the clamp <b>235</b> may be replaced with the quick disconnect element previously suggested (such as quick disconnect <b>234</b> shown in FIGS. <b>18</b>(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>)) so that entire rear wheel/unitary power module wheel can be rapidly dropped for tire/wheel repair. This quick disconnect is similar to the quick disconnect fitting which clamps the bicycle wheels to the dropouts on the bicycle frame.</p>
    <p>As illustrated above, the unitary power module <b>200</b> includes a plurality of quick-release fittings, such as the tabs <b>234</b>, the motor <b>230</b> can be quickly detached from the mounting frame. When re-engaged, accurate gear alignment is automatically established. This feature provides significant advantages, as it is useful both for easy repairs (replacement) and for converting the bicycle back and forth between electric and conventional configurations. Also, a one-way roller clutch <b>240</b> can either be concentric with the target sprocket <b>202</b> and bearing <b>206</b> or it can be attached to a pinion sprocket <b>242</b> on the motor. As is apparent, this is a complete propulsion module or “kit” to convert a bicycle into an electric bicycle. That is, if voltage is applied to the motor, the motor can drive the pinion sprocket, which in turn can drive the larger target sprocket <b>202</b>, and it works as a unitary self-contained module. Further, this unitary power module <b>200</b> can be attached to the outer diameter of the bicycle wheel hub <b>122</b>. The mounting frame <b>204</b> is easily rotated around the wheel axle for any position to attach to the frame <b>106</b> which does not interfere with the bicycle frame stays <b>112</b>.</p>
    <p>In another embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIG. 15, an electric bicycle <b>400</b> comprises a frame <b>106</b> having a rider seat <b>115</b> and propulsion controls <b>328</b> positioned thereon. A steerable front wheel <b>102</b> via the handle bars <b>109</b> has an axle <b>118</b> affixed to a front portion of said frame <b>106</b>, together with a rear wheel <b>104</b> having an axle with a wheel pattern affixed to a rear portion of the frame. A propulsion system <b>400</b> comprises a battery <b>300</b> affixed to the bicycle <b>400</b>, and an electric motor <b>230</b> having a pinion sprocket <b>242</b> affixed thereon the electric motor <b>230</b> suitable to be connected to the battery <b>300</b> by a battery cable <b>232</b>. These components, together with the above-described unitary power module, comprise the electric bicycle <b>400</b> in accordance with the present invention.</p>
    <p>As illustrated in FIGS. <b>16</b>(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>), (<i>d</i>), (<i>e</i>) and (<i>f</i>) the practice of the invention of FIG. 15 (and of FIGS. 1-14) is not limited to a target coupler <b>203</b> having a “criss-cross” spoke pattern, but may use a various embodiments of a target coupler <b>203</b> for transferring rotational power to the rear wheel and provide an independent self-aligned system. Turning now to FIGS. <b>16</b>(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>), with like numerals illustrating like elements, the hub <b>122</b> rotates around a bearing assembly <b>126</b>. The hub <b>122</b> has a “extended” flange <b>514</b> having a sufficient annular extension to form a plurality of openings <b>516</b> about the flange <b>514</b> to receive securing elements <b>518</b>, such as studs, bolts, screws or like, positioned in a matched plurality of openings <b>522</b> on or within the target sprocket <b>202</b>. In this manner, the target sprocket <b>202</b> in combination with the elements <b>518</b> form the target coupler <b>203</b>. In this embodiment, the free wheeling clutch <b>277</b> is positioned on the pinion sprocket <b>242</b>.</p>
    <p>Turning now to FIG. <b>16</b>(<i>b</i>), the free wheel clutch is positioned between target sprocket <b>202</b> and hub <b>122</b>. The hub <b>122</b> has extended flanges <b>532</b>, <b>534</b> which are proximate or adjacent to target sprocket <b>202</b> and hub flange <b>514</b>, respectively. Securing elements <b>518</b>, such as studs, bolts, screws or like, positioned in a matched plurality of openings <b>522</b> on or within the target sprocket <b>202</b> mate with a plurality of openings <b>536</b> in the free wheel flange <b>532</b>. Securing elements <b>540</b>, such as studs, bolts, screws or like, positioned in a matched plurality of openings <b>538</b> on or within the free wheel flange <b>534</b> mate with a plurality of openings <b>522</b> in the target sprocket. In this manner, the combination of the target sprocket <b>202</b>, the flanges <b>532</b>, <b>534</b> on the free wheel clutch <b>277</b> and securing elements <b>518</b> and <b>540</b> form the target coupler <b>203</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. <b>16</b>(<i>c</i>) shows a double ended hub <b>550</b> having a pair of free wheel clutches <b>277</b> on the outside of each extended hub flange <b>514</b> of the flange <b>122</b> with the target sprocket <b>202</b> placed in an annular configuration about the free wheel clutches <b>277</b>. The free wheel clutches <b>277</b> are affixed to the axle by use of a thread <b>552</b> positioned thereon. In this manner, the combination of the target sprocket, free wheel clutches <b>277</b> and axle thread <b>552</b> form the target coupler <b>203</b>. As illustrated in FIGS. <b>16</b>(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) the practice of the invention of FIG. 15 (and of FIGS. 1-14) is not limited to a target coupler <b>203</b> having a “criss-cross” spoke pattern, but may use a various embodiments of a target coupler <b>203</b> for transferring rotational power to the rear wheel and provide an independent self-aligned system.</p>
    <p>Turning now to FIG. <b>16</b>(<i>d</i>), the hub <b>122</b> rotates around a bearing assembly <b>126</b> mounted on the axle <b>118</b>. The hub <b>122</b> has an “extended” hub flange <b>514</b> having a sufficient annular extension to accommodate a plurality of openings <b>522</b> (or holes) to receive securing elements <b>518</b>, such as studs, bolts, screws, or the like, positioned in the matched plurality of openings <b>522</b> on or within the target coupler <b>203</b>. The target coupler <b>203</b> consists of the target sprocket <b>202</b> fixed to an adapter ring <b>521</b> which, together, constitute the “target coupler” <b>203</b>. As illustrated in FIGS. <b>16</b>(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), the target sprocket <b>202</b> is driven by a chain from the pinion sprocket driven by a motor mounted on the mounting plate <b>204</b>. The target coupler <b>203</b> is thus attached to the hub flange <b>514</b> with the elements <b>518</b>, illustrated as screws in FIG. <b>16</b>(<i>d</i>). A bearing carrier <b>524</b> secures the bearing <b>206</b> (or main bearing) which allows the backing or mounting plate <b>204</b> to rotate with respect to the target coupler <b>203</b> and the hub <b>122</b>. A clamp plate <b>519</b> secures the bearing carrier <b>524</b> and mounting plate <b>204</b> to the target coupler <b>203</b>. Alternatively, a free wheeling clutch <b>277</b> (not shown) may be positioned between the hub <b>122</b> and target sprocket <b>202</b>, as illustrated in FIG. <b>16</b>(<i>f</i>), or positioned on the motor pinion sprocket <b>242</b> as illustrated in FIG. <b>16</b>(<i>a</i>).</p>
    <p>Turning now to FIG. <b>16</b>(<i>e</i>), the hub rotates around a bearing <b>126</b> mounted on the axle <b>118</b>. The hub <b>122</b> is double ended and has extended ends <b>527</b> having a sufficient annular extension <b>528</b> to form at least one and preferably a pair of outward extended threaded assemblies <b>521</b>. On one end of the hub <b>122</b>, the threaded assembly <b>521</b> receives the target coupler <b>202</b>, which comprises the target sprocket <b>202</b> fixed to the annular coupler ring <b>529</b>. This target coupler <b>203</b> has mating threads <b>523</b> about the coupler ring <b>529</b>, which allow the target coupler <b>203</b> to be screwed to the threads <b>521</b> and thus to the hub <b>122</b> against a shoulder <b>531</b> formed upon the hub <b>122</b>. The plate <b>519</b> secures the bearing assembly <b>206</b> and the mounting plate <b>204</b>. The mounting plate <b>204</b>, to which a motor and driving pinion sprocket is mounted as illustrated in FIG. <b>16</b>(<i>a</i>), is thus secured to the target coupler <b>203</b> and hub <b>122</b> through the bearing <b>206</b>, which allows it to rotate with respect to the target coupler <b>203</b>. Alternatively, a free wheeling clutch <b>277</b> (not shown) may be positioned between the hub <b>122</b> and target sprocket <b>202</b>, as illustrated in FIG. <b>16</b>(<i>f</i>), or positioned on the motor pinion sprocket <b>242</b> as illustrated in FIG. <b>16</b>(<i>a</i>).</p>
    <p>FIG. <b>16</b>(<i>f</i>) shows another embodiment with a free-wheel or one-way clutch <b>277</b> mounted between the target sprocket <b>202</b> and the hub <b>122</b>. The hub <b>122</b> has a flange <b>551</b> and a threaded end <b>523</b> as in FIG. <b>16</b>(<i>e</i>). The target sprocket <b>202</b> can rotate in only one direction relative to the hub <b>122</b> because it rotates on a free wheel clutch <b>277</b>. This target sprocket <b>202</b>-clutch <b>277</b> assembly <b>280</b> is proximate to an assembly <b>282</b> comprising the mounting plate <b>204</b> and bearing <b>206</b> and it is separated from the assembly <b>282</b> such that each of the assemblies <b>280</b>, <b>282</b> can rotate independently around the hub <b>122</b>. A retaining nut <b>553</b> secures the overall assemblies <b>280</b>, <b>282</b> to the hub <b>122</b> by the threaded end <b>523</b>. In this embodiment, with the free-wheel clutch <b>277</b> mounted between the target coupler <b>203</b> and the hub <b>122</b>, it is thus seen that the free-wheel <b>277</b> can be located both in this location, as well as on the motor-shaft pinion gear, as described above.</p>
    <p>Turning now to FIG. 17, a quick disconnect motor mount <b>500</b> which may be used with the present invention using either a chain, or belt drive as illustrated. For example, the “quick disconnect” feature for the motor <b>230</b> will be used in several applications such as for folded bicycles, or in areas where security of the motor <b>230</b> may be required. The “quick disconnect” feature can be used where the motor shaft <b>502</b> ends with a spline which slides in and out of the shaft on which a sprocket or sprockets is/are mounted. As illustrated, the motor shaft comprises an external spline <b>504</b>, which engages a shaft <b>506</b> with an internal spline <b>508</b> which is supported by two bearings <b>510</b>,<b>512</b> spaced apart on the mounting frame <b>204</b>. The motor housing includes quick release tabs <b>234</b>, or the like, which may be quickly moved, thereby allowing the motor shaft <b>502</b> to be withdrawn or inserted within the shaft internal spline <b>508</b>.</p>
    <p>Turning now to FIGS. <b>18</b>(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) a quick disconnect motor mount <b>600</b> may be used with the present invention using a gear drive. Because of the gear to gear engagement between the pinion sprocket <b>242</b> and the target sprocket <b>202</b>, merely rotating the tabs <b>234</b> as illustrated in FIGS. <b>18</b>(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) allows the motor to be removed from a unlocked to a locked position, respectively. As is apparent, by the mounting frame <b>204</b> including a shaft suitable to engage and disengage a motor shaft <b>244</b> from a power to a non-power posture upon either engagement or the disengagement of the motor <b>230</b> from the mounting frame, the motor <b>230</b> may quickly be removed for storage and safekeeping when necessary.</p>
    <p>Merely by way of illustration, the following examples set forth typical design parameters to achieve predetermined performance of torque and efficiency.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE 1</heading> <p>The present unitary power module can provide optimum bicycle performance of torque and efficiency by reducing the RPM's of a high RPM motor to a relatively low number of revolutions per minute (“RPM”) suitable to power the bicycle at a predetermined speed. For example, for a given pinion of modest diameter of 1″ (which is necessary to keep the unitary power module reasonably small overall), the overall speed reduction of the motor RPM can be determined by the selection of the target sprocket. For a given target sprocket diameter of 7″ and the pinion diameter of 1″, the resultant reduction ratio is 7:1. If a pinion gear is used, it must be of this order of diameter to permit at least several teeth to engage the driven gear for low noise, efficiency and stress. At 10 miles per hour (“MPH”) for a 26″ wheel bicycle, the RPM, of the wheel and the driven gear is 155 RPM. This would be for a motor of 1085 RPM.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE 2</heading> <p>Since most available motors run most efficiently at 3000 RPM or above, a much higher reduction ratio is required. As illustrated in FIGS. <b>10</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>10</b>(<i>b</i>), the desired ratio can easily be achieved with the 2-chain unitary power module and the planetary gear configuration previously described. In using an electric motor having an optimal rotational capacity of about 3000 R.P.M., a bicycle speed of about 12 MPH can be achieved as follows. By reference to the above FIGS. <b>10</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>10</b>(<i>b</i>), S<b>1</b>=1″, S<b>2</b>=4″, S<b>3</b>=1″ and S<b>4</b>=4½″. Thus, a gear reduction ratio of about 18 or 20 is accomplished and the above RPM speed to the bicycle wheel can be achieved.</p>
    <p>It is to be understood that variations on the embodiments of the invention are possible. For example, the invention can be applied to either the front wheel of the bicycle or the rear wheel, in a similar manner as is described above by the application of the invention to the rear wheel. This is readily achieved, as the power cable from the battery appropriately placed is flexible and can readily adapted to reach and engage the motor.</p>
    <p>In yet another variation, the mounting frame may have a hollow extension collar which can be attached by a bearing to the inside of the target sprocket, such that the target sprocket freely rotates about the hollow extension collar.</p>
    <p>In another variation, the present invention can be applied to numerous applications where the advantages of implementing the invention can be gained, such as mopeds, scooters, and motorcycles; three wheeled vehicles including tricycle-like vehicles; four wheeled vehicles including wheel chairs, surrey style, golf cart style and delivery style vehicles; multi-wheeled vehicles, material handling systems including conveyor and pick-and-place style systems, and robotics.</p>
    <p>In a further variation of the invention, the target wheel can be extended beyond a spoke wheel to any target wheel of any propulsion system. While the relative commonality of spoke weave pattern and configuration is important, it is not critical to implementing the invention. For instance, in a solid “disk” wheel, the disk would have mounting holes, which would attach to the wheel in such a way to maintain concentricity with the wheel.</p>
    <p>In yet another variation, the invention can be applied to various drive sources including electric motors, gasoline engines, or any other type of rotating drive source which would suitable for mounting to a mounting frame of the present invention.</p>
    <p>In yet a further variation, the mounting frame may include a receiving collar, spline or other suitable mechanical connection, which allows to target coupler to be precisely aligned to the mounting frame. In this manner, an opening in the mounting plate is not necessarily required.</p>
    <p>The embodiments described above provide a number of significant advantages. For example, because the propulsion system consists of the motor, pinion sprocket, clutch, target sprocket, and target wheel, this invention holds the entire propulsion system within the same reference frame mandated by the mounting plate, thereby constraining the propulsion system tolerances within the propulsion system. These tolerances are determined by the manufacturing tolerances of the propulsion system components as designed independent of the vehicle manufacturing tolerances. This allows the propulsion system to be applied to any vehicle, while maintaining the performance of the propulsion system.</p>
    <p>This reference mounting frame is formed by the target sprocket or disk with the hollow extension collar and grooved surface conforming a wheel pattern. This disk provides solid mounting attachment with the wheel through the grooved surface mating with the wheel hub and spokes. The disk is held concentric with the wheel hub. The sprocket gear is attached to the reference frame disk through either a free-wheeling clutch or directly attached to the reference frame disk. The motor mounting frame is attached to the reference frame disk through a bearing on the hollow extension collar of the disk. The motor is attached to the motor mounting frame, in such a way as to provide for proper meshing of the pinion and driven (or sprocket) gears, independent of axle and hub bearing tolerances. The pinion sprocket is attached to the motor either directly, or through a one-way roller clutch, depending on whether the driven (or sprocket) gear has a free-wheeling clutch. The motor mounting frame is clamped to the bicycle frame to prevent rotation of the mounting frame. In this manner, the drive and target elements are properly aligned to a single reference frame. This unitary or integrated feature of the propulsion system being self-contained can be demonstrated by holding the entire assembly by hand and running it. It should be noted that this invention avoids the axle assembly of the wheel, and as a result avoids the tolerance problems associated with the axle and bearing. This is a significant, important aspect of this invention, and separates it from other drive systems.</p>
    <p>Another important advantage of the invention includes the fact that the tolerances of the propulsion system are independent of the vehicle. The pinion sprocket is held to the driven gear by the tolerances of the propulsion system, rather than the tolerances of the axle or bearing of bicycle frame. The axis of the pinion sprocket and motor are held parallel with the wheel and target sprocket by the tolerances of the propulsion system, specifically the mounting frame and reference target sprocket. In the case of using gears, the meshing of the pinion sprocket (or pinion) and target sprocket gears are held to the tolerances of the propulsion system. Thus, the reference frame disk provides the stable attachment of the propulsion assembly to the wheel.</p>
    <p>Of course, it should be understood that a wide range of changes and modifications can be made to the preferred embodiment described above. It is therefore intended that the foregoing detailed description be understood that it is the following claims, including all equivalents, which are intended to define the scope of this invention.</p>
