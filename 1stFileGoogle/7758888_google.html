The microcapsules have a diameter of approximately 0.1 to 100 micron. The core of each microcapsule includes at least one active ingredient and is encapsulated within a microcapsular shell. The shell is comprised of at least one inorganic polymer obtained by a sol-gel process, and the shell protects the active ingredient before topical application and is designed to release the active ingredient from the microcapsules following application. The composition is useful in encapsulating active ingredients, such as benzoyl peroxide, that are unstable in other formulation, or are irritating to the skin."><meta name="DC.date"

    <p num="p-0002">This application is a continuation-in-part of PCT/IL01/00370, filed Apr. 20, 2001, which claims the benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/198,749, filed Apr. 21, 2000.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0003">The present invention relates to a composition for topical application, which comprises therapeutic, cosmetic, or cosmeceutic active ingredients encapsulated in sol-gel microcapsules and which is designed to stabilize and deliver the encapsulated active ingredients. More particularly, the composition of the present invention is designed to protect ingredients that decompose when in contact with oxygen, water or with other ingredients of the topical formulation, thus enhancing the stability of these sensitive ingredients in the formulation, and is further designed to release the encapsulated ingredients following a topical application, through a pre-designed release mechanism, thus acting as a delivery system.</p>
    <p num="p-0004">The present invention further relates to a process for preparing the microcapsules of the present invention; to methods of delivering the active ingredients from the composition of the present invention, and to uses of the composition of the present invention in the treatment of conditions, diseases and disorders such as, but not limited to, acne, psoriasis, infections and inflammatory processes.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0005">Many active ingredients which are recognized as beneficial for improving skin or hair condition and feeling, for reducing signs of aging and photoaging or for the treatment of skin disorders such as acne, psoriasis, seborrhea and infections, are difficult to formulate in cosmetic compositions or in pharmaceutical preparations. Often these active ingredients decompose when in contact with water, oxygen, oxidants, trace amounts of metallic ions, or with components commonly used in cosmetic or dermatological compositions. Consequently, the shelf life of products containing these ingredients is reduced. Another prevalent problem is that while being effective in treating the skin, many of these active ingredients cause skin irritation. A delivery system for sustained release can contribute to decreasing such irritation by reducing the concentration of active ingredients that are in contact with the skin or hair, at any given moment. In addition, sustained release can extend the duration of activity of the ingredient.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">Perfumes are an example of an ingredient that is frequently added to pharmaceutical, cosmetic or cosmeceutic compositions. Perfumes, while having no therapeutic action, often cause skin irritation. Entrapment of perfumes may serve to decrease skin sensitivity to perfumes, while extending their period of effectiveness through the mechanism of sustained release. Colors and dyes can also benefit from entrapment, since they are often incompatible with other formulation ingredients.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">Various formulations have been developed to address these problems. Improved emulsions of water-in-oil or oil-in-water have been developed, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,171,600, which discloses use of a double emulsion. U.S. Pat. No. 5,851,538 discloses a protection system based on the adsorption of the active ingredient in pores that are present in an organic polymer in a sponge form. U.S. Pat. No. 3,957,971 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,874,105 utilize liposomes as a delivery system.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">U.S. Pat. No. 6,103,267 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,146,664 show that sensitive active ingredients, such as Vitamin A and Vitamin C, can be stabilized as dispersions in a non-solvent and still be active when applied on the skin. A similar approach was used in U.S. Pat. No. 6,077,522, for stabilizing biologically active compounds for various uses.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">FR 2780901, WO 99/03450, FR 2703927, WO 94/04260 and WO 94/04261 disclose microparticles and nanoparticles for encapsulation of cosmetics, pharmaceutics and food compositions, which include cell walls that are formed by cross-linking of organic and bio-organic polymers.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">All the formulations described hereinabove employ organic or bio-organic matrices for stabilizing the active ingredients prior to their use. Organic polymers are inherently more susceptible to chemical and photochemical damage as compared with inorganic polymers. In addition, organic and bio-organic matrices are highly sensitive to shear forces, osmotic pressure, heat, etc., and therefore, tend to release substantially the entire content of active ingredients contained therein immediately following application, hence fan to provide controlled stabilization and delivery.</p>
    <p num="p-0011">Another ingredient that is frequently added to pharmaceutical, cosmetic or cosmeceutic compositions, particularly to anti-acne and dental compositions, is benzoyl peroxide. Such compositions often include a combination of benzoyl peroxide, as a dispersion, and other active ingredients, such as retinoids and antibiotics, which typically exert a synergistic effect in the treatment of acne and other skin or dental conditions, diseases and disorders. However, the preparation and use of these compositions is limited since benzoyl peroxide is a highly reactive oxidation agent and therefore oxidizes the additional active ingredients. Therefore, the presently known formulations that include benzoyl peroxide are typically characterized by limited stability and short shelf life, hence, separate containers are often used for each of the active ingredients.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">U.S. Pat. No. 6,013,637 discloses an anti-acne composition which includes benzoyl peroxide and lycomycin. The disclosed composition is stable for one month, Indeed, this patent further discloses an end product which includes separate kits for the benzoyl peroxide and the antibiotic agent U.S. Pat. No. 4,350,681 discloses a method of stabilizing benzoyl peroxide in a dispersion and a method of treating acne using a benzoyl peroxide composition and a retinoic acid composition. Indeed, the method disclosed in this patent comprises separate topical application of the compositions at a time interval of 10 minutes.</p>
    <p num="p-0013">Hence, the prior at fails to teach a delivery system that provides protection of naive active ingredients from benzoyl peroxide and/or other harsh substances prior to their application. The prior art also fails to disclose a stabilizing system designed to release the active ingredients upon topical application.</p>
    <p num="p-0014">Another media for controlled delivery of drugs, which can be utilized to protect sensitive ingredients, is doping within sol-gel matrices. In this method, monoliths, particles or other forms (such as thin layers, or fibers) are prepared, and the active ingredient is immobilized in the pores of the sol-gel matrix. The sol-gel matrix is doped with small amounts of the active ingredient. This method is utilized in U.S. Pat. No. 5,591,453, WO 97/45367, U.S. Pat. No. 4,169,069, DE 19811900, WO 00/47236, U.S. Pat. No. 4,988,744, JP 07173452, WO 01/12221, JP 09110463 WO 01/13924 and EP 281034, and is further disclosed in Goto et al., Nanoparticles Res. 1 (1999), 205 and in Vallet-Regi et al., Chem. Mater. 13(2001), 308.</p>
    <p num="p-0015">However, sol-gel doped matrices cannot support high loading (of up to 95% wt.) of the active ingredient. In order to obtain high loading, it is essential to form a core-shell structure, where most of the weight of the capsule is the weight of the encapsulated active ingredient (core), and where the thin shell protects the core effectively. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/372,176 discloses a method for the preparation of silica microcapsules containing organic compounds for various uses. This method was utilized in the development of encapsulated sunscreen active ingredients, disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,238,650; where active ingredients are highly retained within the silica capsules, minimizing exposure of the skin to the active ingredient. Sol-gel microcapsules of silica, when formed according to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/372,176, are chemically and photochemically stable, inert and safe for use. When incorporated in cosmetic or pharmaceutical compositions they afford a transparent, cosmetically pleasing product. The hydrophobic/hydrophilic character of the capsules is tailored to suit the purpose, by selecting appropriate sol-gel precursors and reaction conditions. Selection of the makeup of the microcapsule precursors, determines the character of the microcapsular shell surrounding the active ingredient. Thus, for instance, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity can be controlled, so that water-soluble actives and oil-soluble actives can both be present in the same formulation, by encapsulation of one or the other. It is possible to encapsulate hydrophobic materials, that would have required the presence of large quantities of oils in the formulation, in silica, which has a hydrophilic external surface, allowing easy incorporation into aqueous phases. Generally, water based products or emulsions such as oil-in-water emulsions with external water phase are considered to afford improved feel on the skin, and are therefore preferred in many cases over oil-based products (ointments) or water-in-oil emulsions. For that reason it is desirable to have a delivery system that is water dispersible, to allow easy incorporation in the water phase.</p>
    <p num="p-0016">Thus, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/372,176 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,238,650 (both incorporated herein by reference) disclose microcapsule formulations specifically designed to prevent an encapsulated active ingredient from leaving the microcapsule. This is desirable when the active ingredient is an irritant to the body tissue to which it is applied. It is also is desired when the active ingredient acts by interaction with light, such as sunlight.</p>
    <p num="p-0017">Thus, a system that is capable of both holding and protecting the sensitive active ingredient in the formulation and of releasing and hence delivering the active ingredient upon application is not disclosed by the prior art. Such a system can serve to shield and protect active ingredients from undesired decomposition, thus extending the shelf life of the composition and may also serve to segregate incompatible agents present in the same composition during storage. Furthermore, the activity of the active ingredients can be optimized as a result of sustained release, while skin irritation can be reduced, since there is a significant reduction in the concentration of active ingredient in direct contact with the skin, at any given time.</p>
    <p num="p-0018">There is thus a widely recognized need for, and it would be highly advantageous to have compositions for topical application that include therapeutic, cosmetic or cosmeceutic active ingredients encapsulated in sol-gel microcapsules, which are designed to stabilize and deliver the active ingredients encapsulated therein.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0019">While evaluating the potential use of sol-gel microcapsules it was surprisingly discovered that sol-gel microcapsules could be designed to achieve triggered release of their content upon application in a sustained or an immediate manner. It was discovered that compositions comprising pre-designed sol-gel microcapsules are capable of protecting sensitive and/or incompatible active ingredients, such as an antibiotics and benzoyl peroxide, prior to topical application, and are thus characterized by increased stability and extended shelf life. It was further discovered that these compositions could be designed to release the active ingredients following topical application, and therefore function as a delivery system of the encapsulated ingredients.</p>

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0115">The present invention is of sol-gel microcapsules that encapsulate therapeutic, cosmetic or cosmeceutic active ingredients, systems for topical application and compositions containing the active ingredients, methods of releasing, thereby delivering the active ingredients from the composition, methods of preparing the sol-gel microcapsules and a method for treating various conditions, diseases and disorders, such as acne, psoriasis and infections using the compositions. Specifically, the microcapsules and/or compositions of the present invention are designed to stabilize the encapsulated active ingredients prior to topical application and/or to release the active ingredients after topical application and thus serve as a system for enhancing the stability of the active ingredient and/or as a delivery system.</p>
    <p num="p-0116">The principles and operation of the compositions, systems and methods of the present invention may be better understood with reference to the drawings and accompanying descriptions.</p>
    <p num="p-0117">Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description or exemplified by the examples. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.</p>
    <p num="p-0118">According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a therapeutic, cosmetic or cosmeceutic composition for topical application. The composition of the present invention comprises a plurality of microcapsules that have a core-shell structure. The microcapsular core is encapsulated within the microcapsular shell and includes one or more active ingredient(s). The microcapsular shell includes one or more inorganic polymer(s) obtained by a sol-gel process.</p>
    <p num="p-0119">As used herein, the phrase “active ingredient” refers to an ingredient having a therapeutic, cosmetic or cosmeceutic effect,</p>
    <p num="p-0120">As used herein, the phrase “topical application” refers to an application on the skin, hair, ears, mucous membranes, rectal application, and nasal application, as well as dental or gum application within the oral cavity.</p>
    <p num="p-0121">The compositon of the present invention is designed to stabilize the active ingredient(s) prior to the topical application and/or to release the active ingredient(s) from the microcapsules following the topical application.</p>
    <p num="p-0122">These unique properties of the composition of the present invention are highly advategeous as described hereinabove and are derived from the unique structure of the microcapsules in the composition.</p>
    <p num="p-0123">While conventional microcapsules are prepared by coating the core material with organic polymers, in the present invention the core material is coated with inorganic polymers. This imparts unique properties to the microcapsule wall, such as rigidity and hence sensitivity to friction, which result in disintegration of the capsules and release of their contents, during or after topical application by various mechanisms as is further delineated hereinafter. The use of inorganic polymers for the microcapsular wall further grants the ability to control the pore size of the microcapsular shell and eliminates sensitivity of the shell to both organic solvents in the formulation and to components in the treated area.</p>
    <p num="p-0124">The microcapsules of the present invention are further advantageous since they can be easily incorporated into therapeutic, cosmetic or cosmeceutical compositions. Microcapsules that have a hydrophilic external surface can be dispersed in water phases, while microcapsules which have a hydrophobic external surface can be dispersed in oil phases. In both instances, simple mixing is sufficient to achieve effective dispersion.</p>
    <p num="p-0125">For some applications, the microcapsules of the present invention can be designed as heat insensitive, and unless the encapsulated active ingredient is heat sensitive, they may be heated to temperatures normally used in formulation of cosmetic compositions, as is accepted in the art (for instance, up to a maximum temperature of 80° C., for up to 2 hours).</p>
    <p num="p-0126">The microcapsules of the present invention are further advantageously characterized by high loading capacity of the active ingredient(s) therein.</p>
    <p num="p-0127">Preferably, the load of active ingredient(s) in the microcapsules is between about 0.001% and 95% by weight of the microcapsules and, more preferably, between about 5% and 80% by weight of the microcapsules.</p>
    <p num="p-0128">The character of the microcapsular core may be controlled by the process of microcapsule preparation, the percentage of active ingredient present In the core and the solubility of the active ingredient in the core. For example, a higher percentage of a solid active ingredient in the core will result in a core which is more viscous.</p>
    <p num="p-0129">According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the microcapsular core is in the form of an emulsion, preferably an oil-in-water emulsion. An oil-in-water emulsion is highly advantageous when used in compositions for topical application since it enables the use of compositions with external water phase, which are considered to afford improved feel on the skin, and is therefore preferred in many cases over water-in-oil emulsions.</p>
    <p num="p-0130">However, the microcapsular core of the present invention can be further prepared in a form of a solid, an oil solution, an aqueous solution and a dispersion.</p>
    <p num="p-0131">The microcapsules of the present invention are prepared by a sol-gel process, as is further detailed hereinbelow. The sol-gel process is adaptable to different encapsulating materials such as, but not limited for, pure silica, organically-modified silica, titania, silizane, zirconia, alumina, and others, as well as combinations of the above.</p>
    <p num="p-0132">Hence, the inorganic polymer in the microcapsular shell is prepared by a sol-gel process from a sol-gel precursor such as, but not limited to, metal alkoxide monomer, a semi-metal alkoxide monomer, a metal ester monomer, a semi-metal ester monomer, a silazane monomer, a monomer of the formula M(R)<sub>n</sub>(P)<sub>m</sub>, wherein M is a metallic or a semi metallic element, R is a hydrolyzable substituent, n is an integer from 2 to 6, P is a non polymerizable substituent and m is and integer from 0 to 6, a partially hydrolyzed and partially condensed polymer thereof and mixtures thereof.</p>
    <p num="p-0133">According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the inorganic polymer includes an organically-modified inorganic polymer.</p>
    <p num="p-0134">As used herein, the phrase “organically-modified inorganic polymer” refers to a polymer prepared from a sol-gel precursor of the formula M(R)<sub>n</sub>(P)<sub>m</sub>, wherein “M” is a metallic or semi-metallic element, “R” is a hydrolyzable substituent, “n” is an integer from 2 to 5, “T” is a non polymerizable substituent and “m” is an integer from 1 to 6.</p>
    <p num="p-0135">The character of the microcapsular shell of the microcapsules of the present invention depends on the sol-gel precursors used in the preparation of the inorganic polymer and can therefore be modified to suit the needs of a specific application, as further described herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0136">The microcapsules of the present invention have an average diameter of between 0.1 micron and 100 microns. Preferably, the average diameter of the microcapsules is between 3 microns and 50 microns and, most preferably, between 8 microns and 50 microns.</p>
    <p num="p-0137">In a presently preferred embodiment of the present invention, the size of the microcapsules is pre-determined in a controlled manner, as is further detailed hereinbelow. This feature has not been described in the prior art, and is of immense technical importance both in general and in the context of the present invention in particular, as is further detailed hereinbelow.</p>
    <p num="p-0138">The microcapsules of the present invention are cosmetically and pharmaceutically acceptable, being smooth and optionally transparent, and large enough so that they cannot penetrate the epidermis. Furthermore, the microcapsules of the present invention are characterized, upon experiments, as non-scratching, when applied, also following disintegration thereof.</p>
    <p num="p-0139">The therapeutic, cosmetic and cosmeceutic composition of the present invention comprises the microcapsules and may further comprise a pharmaceutically, cosmetically or cosmeceutically acceptable carrier.</p>
    <p num="p-0140">As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically, cosmetically or cosmeceutically acceptable carrier” refers to a carrier or a diluent that does not cause significant irritation to an organism and does not abrogate the biological activity and properties of the applied active ingredient.</p>
    <p num="p-0141">Examples of acceptable carriers that are useful in the context of the present invention include, without limitation, emulsions, creams, aqueous solutions, oils, ointments, pastes, gels, lotions, milks, foams, suspensions and powders.</p>
    <p num="p-0142">The acceptable carrier of the present invention may include, for example, a thickener, an emollient, an emulsifier, a humectant, a surfactant, a suspending agent, a film forming agent, a foam building agent, a preservative, an antifoaming agent, a fragrance, a lower monoalcoholic polyol, a high boiling point solvent, a propellant, a colorant, a pigment or mixtures thereof.</p>
    <p num="p-0143">Therefore, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the final composition may be in the form of an oil, a gel, a solid stick, a lotion, a cream, a milk, an aerosol, a spray, a powder, a foam, a shampoo, a hair conditioner, a lacquer or a make-up.</p>
    <p num="p-0144">The nature of the microcapsules of the present invention and the ability to control his nature, as described hereinabove, enable to design compositions for topical application which stabilize the active ingredient prior to topical application and/or release the active ingredient during or after topical application.</p>
    <p num="p-0145">Hence, according to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a system for enhancing a stability of one or more active ingredient(s) in the therapeutic, cosmetic or cosmeceutic composition for topical application of the present invention. The system comprises the microcapsules of the present invention and is designed to stabilize the active ingredient(s) prior to the topical application.</p>
    <p num="p-0146">According to the present invention, the enhanced stability of the active ingredient is achieved by its encapsulation within the sol-gel microcapsules of the present invention. The encapsulation protects the active ingredient from other ingredients in the formulation and from the environment and thus extends the shelf life of the end product.</p>
    <p num="p-0147">The active ingredient may be encapsulated alone or with other ingredients within the same microcapsule. Co-encapsulation of compounds that enhance stability of the sensitive ingredient is beneficial. For example, anti-oxidants can be co-encapsulated with oxygen-sensitive or oxidant-sensitive ingredients, to give “localized protection”. Similarly, base-sensitive actives may be co-encapsulated with proton donating compounds that can act as a local buffer source. Acid-sensitive active ingredients can be co-encapsulated with proton acceptors, in order to protect them. Water-sensitive actives may show improved stability by encapsulation as solutes in a hydrophobic, water repelling oil. Co-encapsulating with sunscreen active ingredients, can protect light sensitive compounds. Co-encapsulation of a sensitive ingredient and a protective ingredient in one microcapsule, augments the efficacy of the protecting ingredient as both ingredients are encased together in the capsule. Moreover, by constructing such an organized system, the overall concentration of protecting ingredient, which is present in the composition, can be reduced significantly.</p>
    <p num="p-0148">Since the encapsulation creates micro-domains within the entire formulation, one active ingredient can be encapsulated while a second active ingredient can be present in the carrier that surrounds the microcapsules as a non-encapsulated active ingredient. This is advantageous when the ingredients acts synergistically together, yet one is chemically reactive with the other. For example, benzoyl peroxide, retinoids and certain antibiotics are all beneficial for the treatment of acne, yet cannot be formulated together since the peroxide would oxidize the other active ingredients. Therefore, benzoyl peroxide or any other strong oxidant may be encapsulated within sol-gel microcapsules and other active ingredient(s) which are sensitive to oxidation can be present in the pharmaceutical carrier.</p>
    <p num="p-0149">Alternatively, the composition or system of the present invention can include different types of microcapsules, each type encapsulating a different active ingredient. For example, one active ingredient ca be encapsulated in one type of microcapsules while the other active ingredient is encapsulated in other microcapsules. The different types of microcapsules can differ only in the active ingredient encapsulated therein, to achieve enhanced stabilization of a composition that comprises active ingredients that are chemically reactive with one another. Optionally, the different types of microcapsules can differ in other characters thereof, such as their average diameter or the nature of their microcapsular shell, which can further effect the rate of releasing the active ingredients therefrom. This feature of the present invention is of immense importance, as is further discussed hereinbelow.</p>
    <p num="p-0150">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a system for releasing/delivering one or more active ingredient(s) from the therapeutic, cosmetic or cosmeceutic composition for topical application. The system comprises a plurality of microcapsules as described hereinabove and is designed to release the active ingredient(s) from the microcapsules following the topical application.</p>
    <p num="p-0151">According to preferred embodiments of the present invention, the release of the active ingredient(s) is effected by disintegrating the microcapsules or by extracting the active ingredient(s) from the microcapsules, as is further detailed hereinbelow.</p>
    <p num="p-0152">Accordingly, there are provided methods of delivering an active ingredient from the therapeutic, cosmetic or cosmeceutic composition of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="p-0153">In one method, the release/delivery of the active ingredient is effected by disintegration of the microcapsules upon topical application thereof via for example shear forces applied by a spreading action commonly used to spread creams, gels or ointments. Hence, according to a preferred embodiment of this method of present invention, the disintegration is effected by a rubbing or spreading action during or following the topical application.</p>
    <p num="p-0154">In this embodiment of the present invention, the microcapsules are designed to break upon application to the skin, hair or other treated area, due to their relatively large size, e.g., 3-50 microns in diameter, which imparts a structural weakness. Friction formed upon application to the skin, is sufficient to shatter their relatively fragile shell wall. In a preferred embodiment, the thickness of the shell wall is selected to be of approximately 100 nm, which is not relatively thin; whereas the fragility of the microcapsules is due, rather, to the large diameter of the capsules.</p>
    <p num="p-0155">According to another preferred embodiment of this method of the present invention, the disintegration of the microcapsules is effected by drying and/or by electrostatic interactions. Drying can be effected by heating the microcapsules, preferably at a moderate temperature such as, but not limited for, 40° C., which results in their disintegration.</p>
    <p num="p-0156">Alternatively, the microcapsules of the present invention are designed to disintegrate upon application due to the nature of the carrier that surrounds them. In an example, the composition comprises the microcapsules and a water-based acceptable carrier, which has a water content of 80-99%. After topical application, drying of the microcapsules is effected by the evaporation of the water, which leaves the capsules exposed to the environment and thus triggers their disintegration.</p>
    <p num="p-0157">Further alternatively, additives that are capable of maintaining humidity and moisture can be added during the preparation of the microcapsules to control the drying process. Such additives may be entrapped in the sol-gel pores or may be covalently attached to the sol-gel precursors through a non-hydrolyzable residue. Examples of such additives include polymers, fatty acids, fatty acid derivatives, surfactants, polysaccharides, proteins, polypeptides, amino acids and mixtures thereof.</p>
    <p num="p-0158">Additives such as organic polymers and/or surfactants may be added during the sol-gel process to control the surface nature of the sol-gel matrix and the rate of diffusion through the pores present therein. Since the microcapsular shell may be composed of primary sol sub-micron particles, the effective pore size of the shell may be controlled by electrolytes through electrostatic interactions, This may be a trigger for release of the active ingredients.</p>
    <p num="p-0159">In another method, the release/delivery of the active ingredient is effected by extraction of the active ingredient from the microcapsules upon the topical application.</p>
    <p num="p-0160">In one example, the extraction is effected by contacting the composition with moisture or electrolytes, The moisture or electrolytes used in this method are present, for example, in body fluids within the skin, sweat or sebum, The extraction can be also effected by contacting the composition with a surfactant, a buffering agent or mixtures thereof.</p>
    <p num="p-0161">Alternatively, the extraction is effected by contacting the composition of the present invention with an additional composition. This additional composition comprises an auxiliary vehicle such as, but not limited for, moisture, electrolyte, surfactant, buffering agent or mixtures thereof, and is added to the composition prior to the topical application, to trigger the release of the active ingredients by extraction.</p>
    <p num="p-0162">According to another preferred embodiment of this aspect of the present invention, the composition is designed such that it comprises a carrier that contains an auxiliary agent which triggers the release of the active ingredient. Examples of auxiliary agents that are useful in this context of the present invention include surfactants, electrolytes, buffering agents, high boiling point solvents and mixtures thereof.</p>
    <p num="p-0163">In one example, the carrier contains high water content and a solvent having a high boiling point, in an amount of about 10% by weight of the carrier content. In this design, the release of the active ingredient is effected by the evaporation of the water upon application, which is followed by the penetration of the solvent into the microcapsular shell. The solvent dissolves and extracts the active ingredient from within the microcapsules.</p>
    <p num="p-0164">The versatile mechanism of the release/delivery of the active ingredient(s), described hereinabove, provides for a pre-determineable delivery system. The timing of the release of the active ingredient(s) following application can be pre-tailored and hence a diversified release profile can be obtained.</p>
    <p num="p-0165">In one example, the composition includes microcapsules of different sizes, thicknesses and/or shell material and construction, such that the encapsulated active ingredient is released therefrom over a period of time according to any of the above described release mechanisms Hence, the release of the active ingredient from the microcapsules can be designed to be immediate or sustained, by controlling and varying the composition and size of the microcapsular shell and/or the composition of the acceptable carrier surrounding the microcapsules.</p>
    <p num="p-0166">In another example, the composition is designed such that it includes two or more different types of microcapsules, each containing a different active ingredient. Each of the active ingredients is released from the microcapsules at a different time-point following topical application, thus giving a richer therapeutic or cosmetic effect. The release of the different active ingredients in such a composition occurs at different rates or as a result of a different action.</p>
    <p num="p-0167">The therapeutic, cosmetic or cosmeceutic composition of the present invention is therefore highly beneficial for topical application of active ingredients, by being designed to stabilize and/or release the active ingredient encapsulated therein.</p>
    <p num="p-0168">Particularly, the composition of the present invention is highly beneficial in cases where the active ingredients are sensitive to oxygen or other environmental components and in cases where the active ingredients are chemically reactive with one another or with other components present in the composition. The composition is further beneficial in cases where the active ingredients are skin irritating, since the encapsulation thereof accompanied by sustained release, for example, limits the concentration and is time period they contact the skin, while maintaining efficacy.</p>
    <p num="p-0169">Examples of active ingredients that are useful for topical application and can be beneficially encapsulated in the microcapsules of the present invention include vitamins, anti-inflammatory agents, analgesics, anti-fungal agents, antibiotics, anti-viral agents, anti-parasitic agents, anti-acne agents, humectants, dermatological agents, enzymes and co-enzymes, insect repellents, perfumes, aromatic oils, colors, dyes, skin whitening agents, flavoring agents or dental agents.</p>
    <p num="p-0170">As used herein, the term “vitamins” refers to any acceptable vitamin, a derivative thereof and a salt thereof. Non-limiting examples of vitamins include vitamin A and its analogs and derivatives: retinol, retinal, retinyl palmitate, retinoic acid, tretinoin, iso-tretinoin (known collectively as retinoids), vitamin E (tocopherol and its derivatives), vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid and its esters and other derivatives), vitamin B3 (niacinamide and its derivatives), alpha hydroxy acids (such as glycolic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, citric acid, etc.) and beta hydroxy acids (such as salicylic acid and the like).</p>
    <p num="p-0171">The phrase “dental agent” refers to a tooth whitener, a cleanser, a flavor for a toothpaste or mouthwash, a vitamin or other substance having a therapeutic effect on the teeth or oral cavity. Non-limiting examples of dental agents include bleaching agents such as urea peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, sodium perborate and sodium percarbonate.</p>

These ingredients often cause complications, when formulated in such compositions.</p>
    <p num="p-0186">For example, fragrances have no therapeutic action, yet they often cause skin irritation. Entrapment of fragrances may thus serve to decrease skin sensitivity to fragrances, while extending their effectiveness period through sustained release.</p>
    <p num="p-0187">Colors and dyes are also typically incompatible with formulation ingredients. Thus, using the compositions and methods of the present invention, they can be protected by encapsulation and released upon application.</p>
    <p num="p-0188">Examples of flavoring agents are methyl salicylate and peppermint oil, which can be formulated, for example, within a composition useful for dental application.</p>

    <p num="p-0190">According to preferred embodiments of the present invention, the therapeutic, cosmetic or cosmeceutic composition further comprises an adjuvant.</p>
    <p num="p-0191">As used herein, the term “adjuvant” refers to a material used in conjunction with the active ingredient to preserve the stability of the active ingredient within the composition.</p>
    <p num="p-0192">The adjuvant can be encapsulated with the active ingredient within the microcapsular core, as described hereinabove, or be present in the acceptable carrier that surrounds the microcapsules. The adjuvant may further serve to preserve the stability of non-encapsulated active ingredients within the carrier.</p>
    <p num="p-0193">Typical adjuvants according to the present invention include, for example, anti-oxidants, metal sequestering agents, buffering agents and mixtures thereof.</p>
    <p num="p-0194">In one example, a metal sequestering agent is used as an adjuvant encapsulated together with vitamin C.</p>

    <p num="p-0198">As used herein, the term “BHA” refers to butylated hydroxy anisole.</p>
    <p num="p-0199">As the composition of the present invention is beneficial for topical application of a wide variety of active ingredients, it can be efficiently used in the treatment of various disorders and conditions.</p>
    <p num="p-0200">Thus, according another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of treating a skin, hair, ear, mucosal membrane, rectal, nasal or dental condition in a subject in need thereof. The method is effected by topically applying the composition of the present invention onto the area to be treated.</p>
    <p num="p-0201">Non-limiting examples of the conditions, diseases or disorders that are treatable by the method of the present invention include, for example, acne, psoriasis, seborrea, bacteria, virus or fungus infections, inflammatory process, aging signs, dandruff and cavity.</p>
    <p num="p-0202">In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the therapeutic, cosmetic or cosmeceutical composition employed includes a peroxide such as, but not limited to, benzoyl peroxide as the encapsulated active ingredient.</p>
    <p num="p-0203">As used herein, the term “peroxide” refers to an organic compound containing an oxygen-oxygen bond capable of cleaving and forming oxygen free-radicals. The peroxides include peroxyacids of carboxylic acids, peroxyesters of carboxylic acids and the dimeric product of carboxylic peroxyacids. Exemplary peroxides include t-butyl peroxyesters of straight and branched chain aliphatic carboxylic acids, and dimeric peroxides such as lauroyl peroxide and benzoyl peroxide.</p>
    <p num="p-0204">As described hereinabove, benzoyl peroxide is a highly reactive active ingredient which is presently used mainly as an antibacterial and antimicrobial agent in the treatment of acne or as an antibacterial and bleaching agent in toothpaste and other compositions designed for oral cavity/dental applications. In most of the presently known formulations for topical application, the benzoyl peroxide serves as an active ingredient that reacts synergistically with other active ingredients such as antibiotics and retinoids. However, those other active ingredients are easily oxidized by the benzoyl peroxide and therefore the production, storage and use of the formulations containing these ingredients is limited. Furthermore, since benzoyl peroxide is highly reactive per se, and therefore unstable and tends to cleave exothermically even at room temperature, the formulations thereof often include ingredients designed to stabilize the peroxide prior to its application.</p>
    <p num="p-0205">Enhanced stability of benzoyl peroxide, according to the present invention, is obtained by its encapsulation within the microcapsules of the present invention. The benzoyl peroxide is present in the microcapsular core, preferably as an oil-in-water emulsion or as a solid-in-oil-in-water emulsion, and is encapsulated by the microcapsular shell. The microcapsular shell protects the benzoyl peroxide from contacting the environment and thus reduces its reactivity and/or sensitivity. The microcapsular shell fiber protects the benzoyl peroxide from reacting with other active ingredients in the composition, as described hereinabove.</p>
    <p num="p-0206">The release or delivery of the benzoyl peroxide from the microcapsules is effected by the systems and methods described hereinabove, Since the systems and methods of the present invention are designable for controlled release of the active ingredients, they enable, if so required, a controlled, sustained release of the benzoyl peroxide from the microcapsules. This, in turn, is beneficial because benzoyl peroxide is a very reactive chemical.</p>
    <p num="p-0207">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of treating a skin or dental condition in a subject in need thereof, which is effected by topically applying the benzoyl peroxide containing composition of the present invention onto the area to be treated, which can be used in the treatment of a variety of skin conditions, such as acne, psoriasis, seborrea, bacteria, virus or fungus infection and inflammatory process and in the treatment of dental conditions such as cavities or as a bleaching agent.</p>

The active ingredients that are useful in the present invention are typically oil-soluble, and therefore they are first dissolved in the sol-gel precursor(s) and optionally in one or more oil(s), to form a hydrophobic solution. Alternatively, active ingredients that do not dissolve in a hydrophobic liquid may be encapsulated as a dispersion, by first dispersing in a suitable oil, which is miscible with the sol-gel precursor, prior to dissolving in the sol-gel precursor.</p>

    <p num="p-0214">According to one approach, the hydrophobic dispersion is prepared by first wetting and mixing a solid ingredient to be encapsulated with one or more additive(s) such as, but not limited to, liquids, wetting agents or a combination thereof. The wetted solid obtained is then micronized by grinding, milling or optionally ultrasound, to obtain a dispersion of the solid within the additive(s). The micronizing is effected by employing, for example, a roller mill, a ball mill, a colloid mill a high-pressure mill or a high-shear mill. The milling or grinding is continued, until a dispersion of the active ingredient at the desired particle size is obtained within the liquid phase.</p>

The dispersing phase may be added during each of the steps employed, e.g., during the wetting, during the micronizing or both. The dispersion phase may include, for example, an oil, a sol-gel precursor or a combination When the process employs high concentrations of the solid active ingredient, so as to obtain a high load of the active ingredient in the microcapsules, the amount of oil used in the wetting stage is sufficient and no additional quantity of oil is desired at any later stage, to form the final dispersion. In this case, the dispersion formed in the wetting step is a highly concentrated slurry.</p>

Therefore, each system was followed at its respective λ<sub>max</sub>.</p>
    <p num="p-0264">As is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, systems containing free or solubilized benzoyl peroxide revealed effective oxidation of CR, with much of de CR depleted from the solution. The percent of remaining CR in solution after 20 minutes in systems 2, 4 and 5 were 35%, 15% and 5%, respectively, as compared to 100% for both blanks (systems 3 and 6). Encapsulated BPO, however, revealed low depletion, i.e., 82% remaining CR. These results indicate that benzoyl peroxide can be effectively encapsulated in sol-gel microcapsules such that the microcapsule shell behaves as an isolation barrier from co-formulated oxidation-sensitive compounds. It is also concluded that BPO preserves its activity in the encapsulated state as its release via extraction nevertheless shows oxidative capacity, as seen in system 5 (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
    <heading>Example 8</heading> <heading>Release of Encapsulated Material via Capsule Drying</heading> <p num="p-0265">An encapsulated sunscreen compound, octylmethoxy cinnamate (OMC), prepared as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,238,650 was used as a model in this example. In order to simulate physiological conditions of the epidermis, passage of OMC released from silica capsules through a polysulfone membrane into a glass cell was followed as a function of time.</p>
    <p num="p-0266">Hydrophobic Tuffryn® membranes were preheated with isopropyl myristate and each membrane was placed over the opening of a glass cell (a horizontal Franz-type cell). The area of each membrane was 1.3 cm<sup>2</sup>. The upper side of the membrane was exposed to the air. A suspension of silica-encapsulated OMC was applied to the upper side of the membrane. The underside of the membrane faced the contents of the glass cell, which held approximately 3.5 ml of a 4% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, at pH 7.4, at a temperature of 35° C. The PBS-BSA solution was continuously stirred with Teflon-coated magnets.</p>
    <p num="p-0267">A suspension of microcapsules containing 8.8% OMC (octylmethoxy cinnamate) was gently applied over each membrane and spread evenly on its upper surface. One membrane was loaded with 0.4 ml/cm<sup>2 </sup>OMC suspension, while the second membrane was loaded with 0.005 ml/cm<sup>2 </sup>of OMC suspension.</p>
    <p num="p-0268">At several time points over a period of 22 hours, a sample of 200 μl was removed from the solution in the cell and analyzed using HPLC to determine the amount of OMC that was released from the microcapsules and passed trough the membrane into the glass cell. After each sample removal, an equal volume (i.e., 200 μl) of fresh solution was returned to the cell.</p>
    <p num="p-0269">Cumulative receptor concentration-time profiles were then plotted and used to compare the effect of concentration on passage through the membrane.</p>
    <p num="p-0270">Tables 1 and 2 below show the amount of OMC present in a sample taken from the cell below the membrane after passage through a membrane loaded with 0.005 ml/cm<sup>2 </sup>(Table 1) and trough a membrane loaded with i s 0.4 ml/cm<sup>2 </sup>(Table 2), as measured by HPLC in units of μg/cell.</p>
    <p num="p-0271">The obtained results are further presented in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which plots the results in graph format, and highlighted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which shows the first six hours of the experiment (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> represents an enlargement of the gray area in the lower left-hand corner of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
    <p num="p-0272">As was detected in the withdrawn samples, after 1.5 hours, the OMC was released at significantly increasing amounts through the membrane loaded with 0.005 ml/cm<sup>2 </sup>of OMC, while no significant amount of OMC was detected throughout all time-points of the experiment for samples withdrawn from the cell underneath the membrane loaded with the higher dose of 0.4 ml/cm<sup>2</sup>. These results indicate that no appreciable release of OMC through the membrane occurred. This is contrary to the expectation, as the higher dose of 0.4 ml/cm<sup>2 </sup>contains about 80 times more OMC as compared to the lower dose of 0.005 ml/cm<sup>2</sup>. These paradoxical results can be understood, if the release of OMC from within the microcapsules is triggered by total evaporation of the water content, from the silica suspension. In the case of 0.005 ml/cm<sup>2</sup>, the amount of water is minimal, and the suspension is highly exposed to the air above the membrane, and thus, subject to evaporation. The total evaporation of water leads to drying of the silica pores, which results in release of the encapsulated matter. This drying does not occur in the higher dose of 0.4 ml/cm<sup>2</sup>, therefore the capsules retain their contents, and no OMC is passed through the membrane. Tailoring of the formulation of the carrier surrounding the microcapsules, to induce certain drying rates can therefore be used as a mechanism of controlled release of the encapsulated material.</p>
