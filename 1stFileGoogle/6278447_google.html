    <p>The present application is a continuation of U.S. Ser. No. 08/872,578 filed Jun. 10, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,933,137.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention relates generally to an image capture unit and more particularly to a method and system for accelerating a user interface in such a unit.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Modern digital cameras for taking pictures of scenes and the like typically include an imaging device which is controlled by a computer running a single threaded process. When an image is captured, the imaging device is exposed to light and generates raw image data representing the image. The raw image data is typically stored in a single image buffer where it is then processed and compressed by the processor. Many types of compression schemes are used to compress the image data, with the joint photographic expert group (JPEG) standard being the most popular. After the processor processes and compresses the raw image data into JPEG image files, the processor stores the JPEG image files into an internal memory or on an external memory card.</p>
    <p>Some digital cameras are also equipped with a liquid-crystal display (LCD) or other type of display screen on the back of the camera. Through the use of the LCD, the processor can cause digital camera to operate in one of two modes, record and play, although some cameras only have a record mode. In record mode, the LCD is used as a viewfinder in which the user may view an object or scene before taking a picture. In play mode, the LCD is used a playback screen for allowing the user to review previously captured images either individually or in arrays of four, nine, or sixteen images.</p>
    <p>Besides the LCD, digital camera user interfaces also include a number of buttons or switches for setting the camera into one of the two modes and for navigating between images in play mode. For example, most digital cameras include two buttons labeled “−” and “+” that enable a user to navigate or scroll through captured images. For example, if the user is reviewing images individually, meaning that single images are displayed full-sized in the LCD, pressing one of navigation buttons causes the currently displayed image to be replaced by the next image.</p>
    <p>To display a captured image in play mode, the processor must first access the JPEG image file corresponding to the captured image from memory, decompress the image data sixteen horizontal lines at time, and then send the decompressed data to the LCD. When the user presses the navigation button to see the next image, the user sees the next image slowly replace the previously displayed image from top to bottom. Due to the amount of processing involved, the display of the entire image may take several seconds in some cameras. Not only is the image decompression time slow, but conventional digital cameras also do not allow other camera operations while the JPEG image is being decompressed, which means that the user cannot abort the decompression process. Thus, if the user decides halfway through reviewing a current image that another image is preferred, the camera will not recognize the next action until the current image is fully displayed.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, a user interface of this type appears to the user as being slow and non-responsive when attempting to access multiple images on a digital camera. Speed of access to these images has become increasingly important as these types of cameras have become more widely available.</p>
    <p>There is a need, therefore, to provide images on a display device which allows the user to review multiple captured images, while simultaneously providing a display and a readout for a particular image in an efficient and straightforward manner. It is similarly important to be able to rapidly identify a recognizable representation of the image. Finally, the system and method should be more responsive to the user than previously known systems. For example, in a plurality of captured images, it would be useful to quickly identify two or more particular images quickly, with a minimum of effort. It is also important to provide more efficient ways to quickly navigate through a series of images. The system should be implementable in a simple and cost effective fashion and should be easily handled by a user. The present invention addresses such a need.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>A method and system for accelerating a user interface on a display of an image capture unit is disclosed. The image capture unit includes a plurality of image files for providing a plurality of images, the image capture unit further includes controls for allowing an image to be viewed on the display and for allowing navigation between the plurality of images. In a first aspect a method and system in accordance with the present invention comprises providing a low resolution image, medium resolution image and high resolution image within each image file and allowing the medium resolution image to be viewed on the display.</p>
    <p>In a second aspect a method for accelerating a user interface on a display of an image capture unit in accordance with the present invention includes a plurality of image files for providing a plurality of images, each image file includes a high resolution image therein. The image capture unit includes controls for allowing an image to be viewed on the display and for allowing navigation between the plurality of images. The method and system in accordance with the present invention comprises providing a low resolution image within each image file, the low resolution image being associated with the high resolution image within a particular image file, allowing the low resolution image to be viewed on the display and causing the high resolution image related to low resolution image to be displayed on top of the low resolution image dependent upon the quality of the low resolution image. The method and system also includes allowing for navigation between low resolution images based upon user interaction.</p>
    <p>Through the present invention the user interface allows a user to quickly review images in an image capture unit such as a digital camera or the like.</p>

That is, any image capture device which displays images, icons and/or other items, could incorporate the features described hereinbelow and that device would be within the spirit and scope of the present invention. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiment shown but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features described herein.</p>
    <p>The present invention is a method and system for accelerating a graphical user interface of an image capture unit using expanded image files that allow for the rapid display of captured images.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 1, a block diagram of a digital camera <b>110</b> is shown for use in accordance with the present invention. Camera <b>110</b> preferably comprises an imaging device <b>114</b>, a system bus <b>116</b> and a computer <b>118</b>. Imaging device <b>114</b> is optically coupled to an object <b>112</b> and electrically coupled via system bus <b>116</b> to computer <b>118</b>. Once a photographer has focused imaging device <b>114</b> on object <b>112</b> and, using a capture button or some other means, instructed camera <b>110</b> to capture an image of object <b>112</b>, computer <b>118</b> commands imaging device <b>114</b> via system bus <b>116</b> to capture raw image data representing object <b>112</b>.

System bus <b>116</b> also passes various status and control signals between imaging device <b>114</b> and computer <b>118</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 2, a block diagram of one preferred embodiment of imaging device <b>114</b> is shown. Imaging device <b>114</b> typically comprises a lens <b>220</b> having an iris, a filter <b>222</b>, an image sensor <b>224</b>, a timing generator <b>226</b>, an analog signal processor (ASP) <b>228</b>, an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter <b>230</b>, an interface <b>232</b>, and one or more motors <b>234</b>.</p>
    <p>In operation, imaging device <b>114</b> captures an image of object <b>112</b> via reflected light impacting image sensor <b>224</b> along optical path <b>236</b>. Image sensor <b>224</b>, which is typically a charged coupled device (CCD), responsively generates a set of raw image data in CCD format representing the captured image <b>112</b>. The raw image data is then routed through ASP <b>228</b>, A/ID converter <b>230</b> and interface <b>232</b>. Interface <b>232</b> has outputs for controlling ASP <b>228</b>, motors <b>234</b> and timing generator <b>226</b>. From interface <b>232</b>, the raw image data passes over system bus <b>116</b> to computer <b>118</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 3, a block diagram of one preferred embodiment for computer <b>118</b> is shown. System bus <b>116</b> provides connection paths between imaging device <b>114</b>, an optional power manager <b>342</b>, central processing unit (CPU) <b>344</b>, dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) <b>346</b>, input/output interface (<b>110</b>) <b>348</b>, non-volatile memory <b>350</b>, and buffers/connector <b>352</b>. Removable memory <b>354</b> connects to system bus <b>116</b> via buffers/connector <b>352</b>. Alternately, camera <b>110</b> may be implemented without removable memory <b>354</b> or buffers/connector <b>352</b>.</p>
    <p>Power manager <b>342</b> communicates via line <b>366</b> with power supply <b>356</b> and coordinates power management operations for camera <b>110</b>. CPU <b>344</b> typically includes a conventional processor device for controlling the operation of camera <b>110</b>. In the preferred embodiment, CPU <b>344</b> is capable of concurrently running multiple software routines to control the various processes of camera <b>110</b> within a multithreaded environment DRAM <b>346</b> is a contiguous block of dynamic memory which may be selectively allocated to various storage functions. LCD controller <b>390</b> accesses DRAM <b>346</b> and transfers processed image data to LCD screen <b>402</b> for display.</p>
    <p>I/O <b>348</b> is an interface device allowing communications to and from computer <b>118</b>. For example, I/O <b>348</b> permits an external host computer (not shown) to connect to and communicate with computer <b>118</b>. I/O <b>348</b> also interfaces with a plurality of buttons and/or dials <b>404</b>, and an optional status LCD <b>406</b>, which in addition to the LCD screen <b>402</b>, are the hardware elements of the camera's user interface <b>408</b>.</p>
    <p>Non-volatile memory <b>350</b>, which may typically comprise a conventional read-only memory or flash memory, stores a set of computer-readable program instructions to control the operation of camera <b>110</b>. Removable memory <b>354</b> serves as an additional image data storage area and is preferably a non-volatile device, readily removable and replaceable by a camera <b>110</b> user via buffers/connector <b>352</b>. Thus, a user who possesses several removable memories <b>354</b> may replace a full removable memory <b>354</b> with an empty removable memory <b>354</b> to effectively expand the picture-taking capacity of camera <b>110</b>. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, removable memory <b>354</b> is typically implemented using a flash disk. Power supply <b>356</b> supplies operating power to the various components of camera <b>110</b>. In the preferred embodiment, power supply <b>356</b> provides operating power to a main power bus <b>362</b> and also to a secondary power bus <b>364</b>. The main power bus <b>362</b> provides power to imaging device <b>114</b>, I/O <b>348</b>, non-volatile memory <b>350</b> and removable memory <b>354</b>. The secondary power bus <b>364</b> provides power to power manager <b>342</b>, CPU <b>344</b> and DRAM <b>346</b>.</p>
    <p>Power supply <b>356</b> is connected to main batteries <b>358</b> and also to backup batteries <b>360</b>. In the preferred embodiment, a camera <b>110</b> user may also connect power supply <b>356</b> to an external power source. During normal operation of power supply <b>356</b>, the main batteries <b>358</b> provide operating power to power supply <b>356</b> which then provides the operating power to camera <b>110</b> via both main power bus <b>362</b> and secondary power bus <b>364</b>. During a power failure mode in which the main batteries <b>358</b> have failed (when their output voltage has fallen below a minimum operational voltage level) the backup batteries <b>360</b> provide operating power to power supply <b>356</b> which then provides the operating power only to the secondary power bus <b>364</b> of camera <b>110</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 4A, a memory map showing one embodiment of dynamic random-access-memory (DRAM) <b>346</b> is shown. In the preferred embodiment, DRAM <b>346</b> includes RAM disk <b>532</b>, a system area <b>534</b>, and working memory <b>530</b>.</p>
    <p>RAM disk <b>532</b> is a memory area used for storing raw and compressed image data and typically is organized in a “sectored” format similar to that of conventional hard disk drives. In the preferred embodiment, RAM disk <b>532</b> uses a well-known and standardized file system to permit external host computer systems, via I/O <b>348</b>, to readily recognize and access the data stored on RAM disk <b>532</b>. System area <b>534</b> typically stores data regarding system errors (for example, why a system shutdown occurred) for use by CPU <b>344</b> upon a restart of computer <b>118</b>.</p>
    <p>Working memory <b>530</b> includes various stacks, data structures and variables used by CPU <b>344</b> while executing the software routines used within computer <b>118</b>. Working memory <b>530</b> also includes several input buffers <b>538</b> for temporarily storing sets of raw image data received from imaging device <b>114</b>, and a frame buffer <b>536</b> for storing data for display on the LCD screen <b>402</b>. In a preferred embodiment, each input buffer <b>538</b> and the frame buffer <b>536</b> are split into two separate buffers, called ping-pong buffers (shown by the dashed lines), to improve the display speed of the digital camera and to prevent the tearing of the image in the display <b>402</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 4B, the contents of one of the input buffers <b>538</b> and the contents of the frame buffer <b>536</b> are illustrated. As shown, each input buffer <b>538</b> includes an input buffer A and an input buffer B, and the frame buffer <b>536</b> includes a frame buffer A and a frame buffer B. The input buffers A and B alternate between an input cycle and a processing cycle. During the input cycle, the input buffers <b>538</b> are filled with raw image data from the image device <b>114</b>, and during the processing cycle, CPU <b>344</b> processes the raw data and transmits the processed data to the frame buffers <b>536</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 7, in a preferred embodiment, the processing is performed by a live view generation process <b>612</b>, which is stored in non-volatile memory <b>350</b> and executed on CPU <b>344</b>. However, the image processing can also be implemented using hardware. During the execution of the live view generation process <b>612</b>, the CPU <b>344</b> takes the raw image data from the input buffers <b>538</b>, typically in CCD format, and performs color space conversion on the data. The conversion process performs gamma correction and converts the raw CCD data into either a RGB or YCC color format which is compatible with the LCD screen <b>402</b>. (RGB is an abbreviation for Red, Green, Blue, and YCC is an abbreviation for Luminance, Chrominance-red and Chrominance-blue). After converting the data to YCC, the YCC image data is stored in the frame buffer <b>536</b>. The LCD controller <b>390</b> then transfers the processed image data from the frame buffers to the LCD screen <b>402</b> for display.</p>
    <p>The resolution of the LCD screen <b>402</b> may vary; however, the LCD screen resolution is usually much less than the resolution of the image data that's produced by imaging device <b>114</b> when the user captures an image at full resolution. Typically, the resolution of LCD is ¼ the video resolution of a full resolution image. The size of the input buffers <b>538</b> may also vary, but in a preferred embodiment, two of the input buffers <b>538</b> are required to contain a full resolution image. One input buffer <b>538</b> can therefore contain one image captured at ½ resolution. Since the LCD is capable of displaying images at ¼ resolution, the images generated during the live view process are also ¼ resolution and are therefore be stored in one-half, or in one of the ping-pong buffers of an input buffer <b>538</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring again to FIG. 4B, the ping-pong buffers are utilized during live view mode as follows. While input buffer A is filled with image data, the data from input buffer B is processed and transmitted to frame buffer B. At the same time, previously processed data in frame buffer A is output to the LCD screen <b>402</b> for display. While input buffer B is filled with image data, the data from input buffer A is processed and transmitted to frame buffer A. At the same time, previously processed data in frame buffer B is output to the LCD screen <b>402</b> for display.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 5A and 5B are diagrams depicting the preferred hardware components of the camera's <b>110</b> user interface <b>408</b>. FIG. 5A is back view of the camera <b>110</b> showing the LCD screen <b>402</b>, a four-way navigation control button <b>409</b>, an overlay button <b>412</b>, a menu button <b>414</b>, and a set of programmable soft keys <b>416</b>. FIG. 5B is a top view of the camera <b>110</b> showing a shutter button <b>418</b>, and a mode dial <b>420</b>. The camera may optionally include status LCD <b>406</b>, status LCD scroll and select buttons <b>422</b> and <b>424</b>, a sound record button <b>426</b>, and zoom-in, zoom-out buttons <b>426</b> <i>a </i>and <b>426</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
    <p>Accordingly, the user interface <b>408</b> of the digital camera can be accelerated when accessing captured images through a combination of various features of the present invention. The features include multiple operating modes for the digital camera, the use of multiple thumbnail images for supporting the rapid display of images by eliminating the need to decompress image data in certain operating modes, and speculative decompression of compressed image data for supporting the rapid display of full-sized images in other operating modes. The use of thumbnails and speculative decompression enables the images to be reviewed and navigated more rapidly via representations which can be displayed quickly. Through the present invention the interaction rate and responsiveness to the user is increased significantly over conventional navigation systems.</p>
    <p>As stated above, in one aspect of the present invention, the digital camera is provided with several different operating modes for supporting various camera functions. Although the digital camera includes multiple operating mode, the modes relevant to this description are capture (record), review, and play mode. In capture mode, the camera <b>100</b> supports the actions of preparing to capture an image, and capturing an image through the use of either the LCD screen <b>402</b> alone or the status LCD <b>406</b> with the aid of an optional optical viewfinder (not shown). In review mode, the camera <b>100</b> supports the actions of reviewing camera contents, editing and sorting images, and printing and transferring images. In play mode, the camera <b>100</b> allows the user to view screen-sized images in the LCD screen <b>402</b> in the orientation that the image was captured. Play mode also allows the user to hear recorded sound associated to a displayed image, and to play back sequential groupings of images, which may comprise time lapse, slide show, and burst image images. The user preferably switches between the capture, review, and play modes, using the mode dial <b>420</b>. When the camera is placed into a particular mode, that mode's default screen appears in the LCD screen <b>402</b> in which a set of mode-specific items, such as images, icons, and text, are displayed. Through the use of multiple operating modes, the camera functions and features can be categorized, which allows for faster access to those features and functions than would be possible by nesting all the features in one play mode as in conventional digital cameras.</p>
    <p>Another aspect of the present invention that allows for the acceleration of the user interface <b>408</b> is the use of multiple thumbnails associated with each captured image, which are smaller, reduced-resolution versions of the higher-resolution compressed image data. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, two types of thumbnail images are associated with each captured image and are included in the image's data file.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 6, a block diagram of an enhanced format of still image file in accordance with the present invention is shown. The image file <b>600</b> includes a header <b>602</b>, compressed image data <b>604</b>, a thumbnail image <b>606</b>, a screennail <b>608</b>, and an image tag field <b>610</b>. The image file <b>600</b> may also include a sound file (not shown) if a sound clip has been attached to the particular image.</p>
    <p>The header <b>602</b> includes information identifying the particular image file and the image represented by the image data <b>604</b>. The image data <b>604</b> is the actual data comprising the full-sized captured image in compressed form, preferably in JPEG format. Although the user can typically choose the resolution mode in which images are captured, once an image is processed and compressed, the compressed image data <b>604</b> is the high-resolution representation of the image compared to the thumbnail <b>606</b> and screennail <b>608</b>. If the image is captured at a resolution of 640×480 pixels, for example, then the compressed image data <b>604</b> is typically fifty-to-sixty kilobytes in size.</p>
    <p>The thumbnail image <b>606</b> is a small, uncompressed low-resolution version of the image. In a preferred embodiment, the pixel size of thumbnail image <b>606</b> is less than the display size of the LCD screen <b>402</b> (e.g., 80×60 pixels), and has a storage size of approximately ten kilobytes.</p>
    <p>The screennail image <b>608</b> is a medium-resolution version of the image and in a preferred embodiment is also compressed, although compressing the screennail <b>608</b> is optional. Unlike the thumbnail image <b>606</b>, the screennail image <b>608</b> is display-sized and fills the visible area of the LCD screen <b>402</b> when displayed. In a preferred embodiment, the pixel size of a compressed screennail image <b>608</b> is preferably 288×216 and requires approximately fifteen kilobytes to store.</p>
    <p>The image tag field <b>610</b> includes information, preferably in the form of tags, regarding the image represented by the image data <b>604</b>. Media type tags, for instance, indicate all the media types associated with the image, such as whether the image is a single image or a panorama image, for example. In certain operating modes, the media type tags are used to select the type of icon that is displayed in the LCD <b>402</b> along side the thumbnail image <b>606</b>. Besides media tags, the image tag field <b>610</b> may also include other types of tags for storing additional information regarding the image and/or the camera <b>110</b> itself. For example, a tag could be used to indicate the settings of the camera <b>110</b> at the time the image was captured, or indicate the identity of the camera manufacturer, for instance. The information in these tags may be accessed through the buttons on the camera interface <b>400</b>. The additional information may then be displayed either as text in the LCD <b>402</b>.</p>
    <p>The enhanced image file <b>600</b> of the present invention is created for each image as the user takes pictures while the camera is in capture mode. The enhanced image file <b>600</b> is then used to accelerate the user interface of the digital camera in the review and play mode as follows. When the camera is placed into review mode, the thumbnail images <b>606</b> contained in the image files <b>600</b> are directly displayed on the LCD <b>402</b> as representations of captured images, which eliminates the need to process and decompress the compressed image data <b>604</b>. And when the camera is placed into play mode, the screennail image <b>608</b> contained in the image file <b>600</b> is first decompressed and displayed on the LCD <b>402</b> and then optionally updated with the higher-resolution compressed image data <b>604</b> as the image data <b>604</b> is being decompressed. This feature enables the digital camera to quickly display a full-sized version of the captured image in the LCD <b>402</b> without the delay incurred by first decompressing the higher-resolution JPEG image and resizing it to fit on the LCD <b>402</b>. Whether or not to decompress and display the compressed image data <b>604</b> depends on the resolution of the display and the resolution of the screennail images <b>608</b>, which is explained further below.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 7, a block diagram is shown of the image file generation process, which begins when the camera is in capture mode and the user presses the shutter button <b>418</b> to capture an image. As described above, before the user captures an image in capture mode, frames of raw image data are sequentially captured by the imaging device <b>114</b> at a reduced resolution suitable for LCD screen <b>402</b>, and each of the frame of the raw image data are stored in the ping-pong buffers (FIG. 4B) of an input buffer <b>538</b>. The live view generation process <b>612</b> performs gamma correction and color conversion on the raw image data to convert the data into the YCC format of the LCD screen <b>402</b>, typically YCC <b>222</b> format, and then transfers the YCC <b>222</b> data for each frame to the frame buffers <b>536</b> for display. The raw image data placed into the input buffers <b>538</b> is also processed for extracting exposure, focus, and white balance settings.</p>
    <p>Once the user presses the shutter button <b>418</b> to capture an image, the raw image data is captured by the image device <b>114</b> at a resolution set by the user and the raw image data is stored into an appropriate number of input buffers <b>538</b>.</p>
    <p>The raw image data is then used to generate an enhanced image file <b>600</b> for the captured image including the compressed image data <b>604</b>, the thumbnail <b>606</b>, and the screennail <b>608</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>6</b>.</p>
    <p>When generating the thumbnail and screennail images <b>606</b> and <b>608</b>, the present invention takes advantage of the fact that the YCC data in the frame buffers <b>536</b> has already been processed by the live view generation process <b>612</b> and stored at the reduced resolution of the LCD screen <b>402</b>. Since the thumbnail and screennail images <b>606</b> and <b>608</b> are also intended to be lower-resolution representations of the captured image, the previously processed YCC data in the frame buffers <b>536</b> is used to generate the thumbnail <b>606</b> and screennail <b>608</b> directly, rather than using the raw image data stored in the input buffers <b>538</b>.</p>
    <p>To generate the screennail image <b>608</b>, the YCC data in the frame buffers <b>536</b> is converted from YCC <b>222</b> format into YCC <b>422</b> format and compressed by a conversion and compression process <b>614</b>. To generate the thumbnail image <b>606</b>, the YCC data in the frame buffers <b>536</b> is converted from the YCC <b>222</b> format into YCC <b>422</b> format and then resized by a conversion and resizing process <b>616</b>. During the conversion and resizing process <b>616</b>, the thumbnail image <b>606</b> may be resized by averaging in which a block of pixel values from the YCC <b>422</b> data are averaged to represent one pixel value of the thumbnail image <b>606</b>, and/or by sub-sampling the YCC <b>422</b> data in which only a certain number pixels in a block are used to represent one pixel in the thumbnail image <b>606</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIGS. 4A, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>, after the thumbnail image <b>606</b> and the screennail <b>608</b> are generated, they are stored in working memory <b>530</b> until the compressed image data <b>604</b> is generated. The compressed image data <b>604</b> may be generated either before or after the thumbnail and screennail images <b>606</b> and <b>608</b>. However, in a preferred embodiment, the compressed image data <b>604</b> is generated after the thumbnail and screennail images <b>606</b> and <b>608</b> are generated using a background spooling process <b>618</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the thumbnail image <b>606</b> and the screennail <b>608</b> may be generated by the background spooling process <b>618</b> along with the compressed image data <b>604</b>.</p>
    <p>In another preferred embodiment, the thumbnail image <b>606</b> and the screennail <b>608</b> may be generated using a two-stage live view generator <b>612</b>. In the first stage, the live view generator <b>612</b> provides images to the frame buffer <b>536</b> for display as described above. When the user captures an image, the raw image data from the imaging device is compressed due to higher quality before being stored in the input buffers <b>538</b>, and the live view generator <b>612</b> switches to the second stage. In this stage, the live view generator <b>612</b> decompresses the compressed raw image data and processes the data into both YCC <b>222</b> data and YCC <b>422</b> data. The live view generator <b>612</b> may then transfer the YCC <b>422</b> data to the frame buffer <b>536</b> for display, and generate the thumbnail image <b>606</b> and the screennail <b>608</b> from the YCC <b>422</b> data.</p>
    <p>The background spooling process <b>618</b> preferably includes RAM spoolers <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> (<b>620</b>), removable memory spoolers <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> (<b>624</b>), and an image processing and compression process (IPC) <b>622</b>. Processes <b>620</b>, <b>622</b> and <b>624</b> are preferably implemented as background processes on CPU <b>344</b> and may therefore run in parallel with other processes. As used herein, a spooler is a process that transfers data from one process or device to a second process or device. The primary purpose of the background spooling process <b>618</b> is to move data out of the input buffers <b>538</b> as fast as possible in order to free the input buffers <b>538</b> to capture another image. After the data is moved, the data is processed in the background. This allows the next image to be captured before the previous image is processed and compressed, which increases the capture rate of the digital camera.</p>
    <p>In operation, after the user has captured an image, control of the raw image data in the input buffers <b>538</b> is transferred to RAM spooler <b>1</b> (<b>620</b>) if the RAM disk <b>532</b> is not full If the RAM spooler <b>1</b> (<b>620</b>) obtains control of the raw image data, then the RAM spooler <b>1</b> (<b>620</b>) transfers the raw image data to the RAM disk <b>532</b>. Alternatively, if the RAM disk <b>532</b> is full, then control of the raw image data is transferred to the IPC <b>622</b> where the data is processed and compressed to generate the compressed image data <b>604</b> (FIG. <b>6</b>).</p>
    <p>In the case where the raw image data has been transferred to the RAM disk <b>532</b>, the removable memory spooler <b>1</b> (<b>624</b>) may then access the raw image data from the RAM disk <b>532</b> and transfer it to the removable memory <b>354</b>. Once the raw image data is transferred to the removable memory <b>354</b>, the IPC <b>622</b> accesses the raw image data and processes the raw image data to generate the compressed image data <b>604</b>. Alternatively, if the removable memory <b>354</b> is full or is not present, then the removable memory spooler <b>1</b> (<b>624</b>) may provide the raw image data directly to the IPC <b>622</b> for generation of the compressed image data <b>604</b>.</p>
    <p>After the compressed image data <b>604</b> is generated, the IPC <b>622</b> may provide the compressed image data <b>604</b> to the RAM spooler <b>2</b> (<b>620</b>). The compressed image data <b>604</b> is then combined with the thumbnail <b>606</b> and the screennail <b>608</b> to generate the enhanced image data file (FIG. <b>6</b>), and the RAM spooler <b>2</b> (<b>620</b>) transfers the compressed image data file <b>600</b> to the RAM disk <b>532</b>. Once the image data file <b>600</b> is written to RAM disk <b>532</b>, the removable memory spooler <b>2</b> (<b>624</b>) may then access the image data file <b>600</b> and write the image data file <b>600</b> onto the removable memory <b>354</b>. If the removable memory <b>354</b> is not inserted, the image data file <b>600</b> remains on the RAM disk <b>532</b>. It should be noted that in an alternative embodiment, the digital camera may be implemented without a RAM disk <b>532</b>, in which case the image data would be spooled to and from the removable memory <b>354</b>.</p>
    <p>The preferred use of the enhanced image data file <b>600</b> of the present invention to accelerate the user interface of the review mode and the play mode of the digital camera are described below.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 8, a diagram illustrating the operation and appearance of the accelerated user interface during review mode is shown in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Moving the mode dial <b>420</b> (FIG. 5B) or other such button to access the review mode enables the user to view all the images in the camera along with specific attributes associated with of each of the images. In a preferred embodiment, the review screen layout displays four small thumbnails <b>700</b> at a time and is based on a filmstrip metaphor which allows users to quickly move forward and backward among pictures chronologically according to date and time.</p>
    <p>The user may navigate through the series of small thumbnails <b>700</b> in the LCD screen <b>402</b> using the four-way navigation control button <b>409</b>. When the user depresses or holds down the left/right buttons <b>410</b>, the small thumbnails <b>700</b> are scrolled-off the LCD screen <b>402</b> and replaced by new small thumbnails <b>700</b> representing other captured images to provide for fast browsing of the camera contents. A stationary selection arrow line <b>702</b> is used as both a navigational aid and to indicate which small thumbnail <b>700</b> is the currently selected image. As the user presses the navigation buttons <b>410</b> and the small thumbnails <b>700</b> scroll across the LCD screen <b>402</b>, the small thumbnail <b>700</b> that is positioned over a selection indication in the selection arrow line <b>702</b> is considered the currently selected image. In an alternative embodiment, the selection indication is stationary except when positioned near the beginning and the end of the image list.</p>
    <p>In a preferred embodiment, when no captured images are available in the camera, the LCD <b>702</b> displays a message indicating this to be the case. When only one image is available, then the small thumbnail <b>700</b> representing that image is displayed above the selection indication in the selection arrow line <b>702</b>. And when there are more than four images in the camera, the selection arrow line <b>702</b> displays arrow heads to indicate movement in that direction is possible with the left/right navigation buttons <b>410</b>.</p>
    <p>After a small thumbnail <b>700</b> becomes the currently selected image, additional information corresponding to that image is automatically displayed in the LCD screen <b>402</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the additional information includes a resized thumbnail <b>704</b> showing a larger view (120×90 pixels) of the currently selected image, and image information comprising an icon bar <b>706</b> and text <b>708</b>. The icon bar may display several icons indicating the media types associated with the active image, such as whether the image is a still, a time lapse, or a burst image, whether sound is attached to the image, and a category for the image. The displayed text <b>708</b> may include a specification of the name or number of the image, and the date and time the image was captured.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 9, a flow chart illustrating the process of accelerating the user interface of the digital camera when in review mode is shown in accordance with the present invention. The process begins once review mode is invoked in step <b>720</b>. Referring now to FIGS. 3, <b>6</b>, <b>8</b>, and <b>9</b>, after review mode is invoked, each of the thumbnail images <b>606</b> to be displayed in the current screen are fetched from the corresponding image data files <b>600</b> stored on the removable memory <b>354</b> (or a host computer if connected) in step <b>722</b>.</p>
    <p>To further increase the display speed of the user interface, one of the frame buffers <b>536</b> shown in FIG. 4B is used as a dedicated draw buffer and the other as a dedicated display buffer in a preferred embodiment of the present invention. When displaying a given review mode screen, all the screen elements are first drawn in the draw buffer and then moved to the display buffer where the data is then output to the LCD <b>402</b> for display.</p>
    <p>After a thumbnail image <b>606</b> is fetched and placed into working memory <b>530</b>, the thumbnail image <b>606</b> is cropped to generate a small thumbnail <b>700</b>, and the small thumbnail <b>700</b> is written into the draw buffer in step <b>724</b>. In one preferred embodiment, the small thumbnails <b>700</b> are generated by cropping the center of thumbnail image <b>606</b> to a square size (50×50 pixels) irrespective of image orientation before being displayed. This is done because the small thumbnails <b>700</b> are intended to serve as navigational aides rather than accurate representations of their images and the square size reduces the amount of space in the LCD <b>402</b> that would be required to support the display of both landscape and portrait thumbnail images. In an alternate embodiment, the thumbnails <b>700</b> may be displayed in the LCD <b>402</b> in their true orientation and aspect ratio (portrait or landscape). In another embodiment, the thumbnails may also be displayed in landscape format and may be cropped or uncropped to resemble images laid out on a conventional wet film negative.</p>
    <p>After all the small thumbnail images <b>700</b> are written into the draw buffer, the thumbnail image <b>606</b> associated with the currently selected image is resized to generate the larger resized thumbnail <b>704</b> and the resized thumbnail <b>704</b> is written into the draw buffer in step <b>726</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the resized thumbnail <b>704</b> is generated by multiplying the thumbnail image <b>606</b> by a multiplication factor, such as 1.5, which effectively increases the image size by 2.25. Rather than expanding the thumbnail image <b>606</b>, the resized thumbnail <b>704</b> could also be generated by expanding the small thumbnail <b>700</b>. Since the small thumbnail <b>700</b> is cropped to a square size, however, expanding the original thumbnail image <b>606</b> provides a better representational view of the selected image as it indicates the true orientation of the image.</p>
    <p>After the resized thumbnail <b>704</b> is written, additional information regarding to the selected image is written into the draw buffer in step <b>728</b>. The additional information is displayed by accessing the image tags <b>610</b> from the image file <b>600</b> corresponding to the selected image. After the draw buffer contains all the necessary screen elements, the contents of the draw buffer are moved to the display buffer and then output to the LCD <b>402</b> in step <b>730</b>.</p>
    <p>As the user scrolls through the small thumbnails in the LCD <b>402</b> in step <b>730</b>, then the next thumbnail image <b>606</b> to be displayed is fetched from its image data file <b>600</b> and placed into working memory <b>530</b> as described with reference to step <b>722</b> and the process repeats. In one preferred embodiment, if the user holds down the left/right navigation button <b>410</b>, the resized thumbnail <b>704</b> is updated as the selected image changes, and the small thumbnails <b>700</b> scroll only as fast as the resized thumbnail <b>704</b> can be updated. In another preferred embodiment, the resized thumbnail <b>704</b> is not updated with each new selected image, and the small thumbnails <b>700</b> rapidly move across the screen at a predefined rate in a smooth scroll, rather than in incremental jumps. In this embodiment, the resized thumbnail <b>704</b> is updated once the user releases the left/right navigation button <b>410</b> to stop scrolling.</p>
    <p>In accordance with the present invention, both small and large thumbnail <b>700</b> and <b>704</b> are displayed in the review mode using the thumbnail image data <b>606</b>. Since no JPEG decompression is necessary to display the thumbnails <b>700</b> and <b>704</b>, image display time and responsiveness of the user interface is significantly increased. And since the resized thumbnail <b>704</b> is displayed along with the small thumbnails <b>700</b>, the user can easily identify a given image while maintaining the ability to scroll through the images.</p>
    <p>In alternative embodiments, if the speed of the removable media is a hindrance, then the above process could be implemented by caching a set of thumbnail images <b>606</b> into working memory. The process could also be implemented without partitioning the frame buffers <b>536</b> into a draw and display buffer, and could be implemented instead by swapping ping-pong buffers. However, it is believed the preferred embodiment will result in performance gains because only elements of the screen that change are redrawn in the draw buffer, while the background and other screen elements that remain constant and are not redrawn, which saves time and frees processing cycles for other tasks.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 10, a diagram illustrating the operation and appearance of the accelerated user interface during play mode is shown in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Moving the mode dial <b>420</b> (FIG. 5B) or other such button to access the play mode enables the user to view full-sized images and to play-back various media types associated with the images. In a preferred embodiment, the play screen layout displays one full-sized image at a time in the orientation that the image was captured. As in the review mode, the user may chronologically navigate through the full-sized images in the LCD screen <b>402</b> using the left/right buttons <b>410</b> on four-way navigation control button <b>409</b>. Users can also play back various media types, such as time lapse, bursts and slide show images according to either default or user defined play back rates.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 11A a flow chart illustrating the process of accelerating the user interface of the digital camera when in play mode is shown in accordance with the present invention. The process begins once play mode is invoked in step <b>800</b>. Referring now to FIGS. 3, <b>6</b>, and <b>10</b>, after play mode is invoked, the screennail image <b>608</b> corresponding to the selected image is fetched from the image data file <b>600</b> stored on the removable memory <b>354</b> (or a host computer if connected) in step <b>802</b>. The screennail image <b>608</b> is then decompressed and displayed in the LCD screen <b>402</b> in step <b>804</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 11B illustrates an example of a screennail <b>809</b> displayed on the LCD screen <b>402</b>. Because the screennail <b>809</b> is only medium-resolution, the image is not quite clear, but is adequate for a user to tell what image it represents. Referring again to FIG. 11A, if the user presses and holds down the left/right buttons <b>410</b> in step <b>806</b>, then a series of screennail images <b>608</b> are continually decompressed and displayed in the LCD screen <b>402</b> in step <b>808</b> until the user releases the button.</p>
    <p>After the button is released, whichever image is currently being displayed becomes the selected image, and the compressed image data <b>604</b> corresponding to the selected image is fetched from the image file <b>600</b> and decompressed and resized to fit the display in step <b>810</b>. In a preferred embodiment, as the compressed image <b>604</b> is being decompressed, the screennail image <b>608</b> in the LCD screen <b>402</b> is updated with decompressed image block by block in step <b>812</b>.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 11C and 11D illustrate an example of a higher-resolution compressed image <b>811</b> replacing the screennail <b>809</b> on the LCD screen <b>402</b> from top to bottom as the compressed image <b>604</b> is decompressed and resized. In an alternative embodiment, the compressed image <b>604</b> may be decompressed and resized in its entirety first and then displayed to replace the screennail image <b>608</b> in one step.</p>
    <p>In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the play mode user interface may be further accelerated by optionally displaying the compressed image data <b>604</b>. That is, if the screennail quality is such that its display on the LCD screen <b>402</b> is indistinguishable from the display of the compressed image data <b>604</b>, then there is no reason to spend the time decompressing and displaying the compressed image data <b>604</b>. Whether or not to display the compressed image data <b>604</b> depends on two factors: the resolution of the screennail image <b>608</b>, which is determined by the compression factor used to compress the screennail <b>608</b>, and the resolution of the LCD screen <b>402</b>. If the resolution of the screennail <b>608</b> matches or surpasses the resolution of the LCD screen <b>402</b>, then only the screennail <b>608</b> is displayed in play mode. In this case, the camera can be programmed to monitor whether it is attached to a higher resolution device, such as a PC monitor or television, via the camera's video jack. If so, then the compressed image data <b>608</b> is also decompressed and displayed on higher resolution device, as in step <b>812</b>.</p>
    <p>Continuing with the FIG. 11A, if the user presses one of the navigation buttons <b>410</b> in step <b>814</b>, then the decompressing process is interrupted (if not yet complete) in step <b>816</b> and the next screennail image <b>608</b> is decompressed and displayed in step <b>808</b>. It should also be understood that the process of decompressing the compressed image is also interrupted if the user changes modes.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, by displaying screennail images only when the user holds down a navigation button, the user may scroll through full-sized images more quickly than in conventional digital cameras since decompressing the low resolution screennails is faster than decompressing full-sized compressed images. In addition, since the CPU responds to interrupts caused by position and mode changes, the user may abort the decompression and display of an unwanted compressed image and quickly forward to the next image. That is, since the buttons of the user interface are not frozen while an image is being displayed as in conventional digital cameras, the camera responds to user input immediately and the responsiveness of the digital camera user interface is greatly increased.</p>
    <p>In another aspect of the present invention, the compressed screennail image <b>606</b> are speculatively decompressed in the review and play modes to further accelerate the user interface of the digital camera. Referring again to FIG. 4A, recall that in the capture mode, the input buffers <b>538</b> are used as capture buffers to capture incoming image data. When the camera is placed into review and play modes, however, the input buffers <b>538</b> are typically unused. According to the present invention, these unused input buffers <b>538</b> are reallocated as working memory <b>530</b> when the camera is placed into the review and play modes.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 12, a memory map of the DRAM is shown illustrating the reallocation of the input buffers as speculation buffers in accordance with the present invention. The DRAM <b>346</b> is shown as including (N) speculation buffers <b>850</b>, which are used by a background process to speculatively decompress image data corresponding to images the user may potentially scroll to. By using part of the DRAM <b>346</b> as input buffers <b>358</b> to capture input data in one mode, and then using that same part of DRAM <b>346</b> as speculation buffers <b>850</b> to decompress image data in other modes the present invention provides for the multiple use of memory.</p>
    <p>During the speculative decompression of the present invention, the speculation buffers <b>850</b> are used to decompress screennail images <b>608</b> and compressed images <b>604</b> in the background during review and play modes. If the user is currently in review mode and switches to play mode, or selects the next image while in play mode, the screennail for the selected image is displayed immediately since it has already been decompressed. As the user begins to scroll from image to image, the screennails that have already been decompressed are similarly displayed. If the user maintains position on the currently selected image long enough, then once all the speculation buffers <b>850</b> have been filled with decompressed screennails, the process begins to replace the screennail images in the speculation buffers <b>850</b> by decompressing their respective compressed image data <b>604</b>. This way when the user switches to play mode or selects the next image while in play mode, the higher-resolution image is instantaneously displayed since it has already been decompressed. When this occurs, the step of displaying the screennail is skipped.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 13, a flow chart depicting the speculative decompression process is shown in a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The process begins when either the review or play modes are invoked in step <b>900</b>. Once this occurs, it is determined how many speculation buffers <b>850</b> are available for use in step <b>902</b>. Given the number of speculation buffers <b>850</b> available, a speculation buffer organization is assigned around the currently selected image based on the scrolling method employed by the user in step <b>904</b>. For example, the user may automatically advance through the images by holding down the left/right navigation button <b>410</b> or by pressing a “play” button in which case the images are advanced at a preset rate. The user may also manually advance through the images by repeatedly pressing either the left or right navigation buttons <b>410</b> <i>a </i>and <b>410</b> <i>b. </i>The buffer organization that is assigned in response to the scrolling method predicts which images will be displayed next and determines the order of screennail decompression accordingly.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 14A, the buffer organization that is assigned to the images in response to an automatic scrolling method is shown. Given M speculation buffers <b>850</b>, the speculation buffers <b>850</b> are assigned such that the currently selected image N in a sequence of images is decompressed first. Thereafter, the order of screennail decompression extends from the selected image N to image N+1, image N+2, image N+3, image N+4, and so on. This order ensures that as the user continues to scroll in the same direction, the screennails <b>608</b> for the images ahead of the current image will be decompressed ahead of time and may be displayed without delay when they become the selected image.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 14B, the buffer organization that is assigned to the images in response to the manual scrolling method is shown. Given M speculation buffers <b>850</b> and a currently selected image N in a sequence of images, the speculation buffers <b>850</b> are assigned such that the currently selected image N in a sequence of images is decompressed first. Thereafter, the order of screennail <b>608</b> decompression alternates around the selected image N as follows: image N+1, image N−1, image N+2, image N−2, and so on. By speculatively decompressing the screennails <b>608</b> for the images neighboring the selected image, the screennails <b>608</b> may be displayed without delay whether the user advances to the next or the previous image.</p>
    <p>Referring again to FIG. 13, after the buffer organization is assigned, the process gets (N), the number of the currently selected image, in step <b>906</b>. It should be noted that at this point it must be determined whether the selected image is the first or last captured image, since speculative decompression cannot occur beyond the first or last image. If in review mode, then after getting (N) the process must also fetch the screennail <b>608</b> for the selected image (N) from the image's image data file <b>600</b>.</p>
    <p>After getting (N) in step <b>906</b>, it is determined whether a screennail update of any of the speculation buffers <b>850</b> is required in nearest neighbor order according to the assigned buffer organization in step <b>908</b>. If an update necessary, then the it is determined whether a speculation buffer <b>850</b> is free in step <b>910</b>. If a speculation buffer <b>850</b> is not free, then the speculation buffer <b>850</b> used to decompress the screennail for the image farthest away from the current image (N) and opposite to the current direction of scrolling is freed in step <b>912</b>. The freed speculation buffer <b>850</b> is then given to the speculation process in step <b>914</b> and is used to decompress the screennail <b>608</b> for the image that needs updating in step <b>916</b>.</p>
    <p>Referring again to step <b>908</b>, if after getting (N) it is determined that a screennail update of the speculation buffers <b>850</b> is not required, meaning that all speculation buffers contain a decompressed screennail in accordance with the assigned buffer organization, then it is determined whether a compressed image data update of the speculation buffers <b>850</b> is required in step <b>917</b>. In no compressed image data update of the speculation buffers <b>850</b> is required, then all the speculation buffers <b>850</b> contain decompressed image data and the process waits until the current image (N) changes in step <b>906</b>. If a compressed image data update of the speculation buffers <b>850</b> is required in step <b>917</b>, the compressed image data for the image needing updating is decompressed and resized in step <b>919</b>.</p>
    <p>After either the screennail or the compressed image data has been decompressed, it is determined whether review or play mode has been terminated in step <b>918</b>. If so, the speculative decompression process ends in step <b>920</b>. If the review or play mode has not been terminated, then it is determined whether the number of available speculation buffers <b>850</b> has changed in step <b>922</b>. This could occur for example when a previously used input buffer <b>538</b> becomes free and is reallocated as a new speculation buffer <b>850</b>.</p>
    <p>If the number of available speculation buffers <b>850</b> has changed, then the process continues by determining how many speculation buffers <b>850</b> are available for use in step <b>902</b>. If the number of available speculation buffers <b>850</b> has not changed, then it is determined whether the user 's scrolling method has changed in step <b>924</b>. If the user's scrolling method has changed, then the process continues by assigning a speculation buffer organization accordingly, as described in step <b>904</b>. If the user's scrolling method has not changed, then the screennail <b>608</b> for the currently selected image is fetched from its image data file <b>600</b>, as described in step <b>906</b> and the process continues.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIG. 15, a flow chart illustrating the process of accelerating the user interface of play mode using the speculative decompression process is shown. As described in FIG. 11A, after play mode is invoked in step <b>930</b>, the screennail image <b>608</b> corresponding to the selected image is fetched in step <b>932</b>, and decompressed and displayed in step <b>934</b>. Thereafter the speculation process is invoked in step <b>936</b>.</p>
    <p>If the user presses and holds down the left/right buttons <b>410</b> in step <b>938</b>, then it is determined whether a decompressed screennail or decompressed high-resolution image for the next image is available from the speculation process in step <b>952</b>. If a decompressed screennail or high-resolution image is available, then it is copied from the speculation buffer <b>850</b> to the frame buffer <b>536</b> for display in step <b>956</b>. If a decompressed screennail or high-resolution image is not available in step <b>952</b>, then the next screennail image <b>608</b> is decompressed and displayed in step <b>954</b> and the process continues at step <b>938</b>.</p>
    <p>After the navigation button is released in step <b>938</b>, whichever image is currently being displayed becomes the selected image. It is then determined whether a decompressed high-resolution image is available for the selected image from the speculation process in step <b>940</b>. If a decompressed high-resolution image is available, then it is copied from the speculation buffer <b>850</b> to the frame buffer <b>536</b> for display in step <b>942</b>.</p>
    <p>If a decompressed high-resolution image is not available in step <b>940</b>, then the compressed image data <b>604</b> corresponding to the selected image is fetched from the image file <b>600</b> and decompressed and resized to fit the display in step <b>944</b>. In a preferred embodiment, as the compressed image <b>604</b> is being decompressed, the screennail image <b>608</b> in the LCD screen <b>402</b> is updated with decompressed image block by block in step <b>946</b>. If the user presses one of the navigation buttons <b>410</b> in step <b>948</b>, then the decompressing process is interrupted (if not yet complete) in step <b>950</b>. It is then determined whether a decompressed screennail or decompressed high-resolution image for the next image is available from the speculation process in step <b>952</b>, and the process continues.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, by speculatively decompressing the screennail images <b>608</b>, the captured images can be more quickly accessed and reviewed in play mode, thereby facilitating user interaction.</p>
    <p>A method and system for accelerating the user interface of an image capture device has been disclosed. Through the present invention, the user interface is accelerated when accessing captured images through interaction of various features. In a first enhancement, as has been described above, an enhance image file is created for each image that contains a combination of a thumbnail, a screennail, and a full resolution compressed image. Through the use of the enhanced image file, the user interface in review mode is accelerated because the thumbnails can be displayed quickly; and the user may easily recognize images by providing a larger resized thumbnail on the display. In a another enhancement of the present invention, the user interface in play mode is accelerated by displaying the reduced resolution screennail image first and then updating it with higher resolution compressed image so that the user can quickly view an image without waiting for the compressed image to be decompressed. In a further enhancement of the present invention, the input buffers are reallocated to allow for the speculative decompression of such images. In so doing, the images can be navigated more rapidly via representations which can be seen quickly. Through the present invention the interaction rate and responsiveness to the user is increased significantly over conventional digital camera navigation systems.</p>
    <p>Although the present invention has been described in accordance with the embodiments shown, one of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that there could be variations to the embodiments and those variations would be within the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, the accelerated user interface also applies to cameras having only two modes, but that have multiple navigation screens within the “play mode” Accordingly, many modifications may be made by one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims.</p>
