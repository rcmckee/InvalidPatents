In one embodiment, the connector assembly comprises a single port pair with a single substrate disposed in the rear portion of the housing. In another embodiment, the assembly comprises a multi-port “row-and-column” housing with multiple substrates (one per port) received within the rear of the housing, each substrate having signal conditioning electronics which condition the input signal received from the corresponding modular plug before egress from the connector assembly. In yet another embodiment, the connector assembly comprises an indicator assembly having a plurality of optically transmissive conduits, the assembly being disposed largely outside the external noise shield of the connector and removable therefrom. Methods for manufacturing the aforementioned embodiments are also disclosed.</div>

    <p num="p-0006">Existing modular jack/connector technology commonly utilizes individual discrete components such as choke coils, filters, resistors, capacitors, transformers, and LEDs disposed within the connector to provide the desired functionality. The use of the discrete components causes considerable difficulty in arranging a layout within the connector, especially when considering electrical performance criteria also required by the device. Often, one or more miniature printed circuit boards (PCBs) are used to arrange the components and provide for electrical interconnection there between. Such PCBs consume a significant amount of space in the connector, and hence must be disposed in the connector housing in an efficient fashion which does not compromise electrical performance, and which helps minimize the manufacturing cost of the connector. This is true in both single and multi-row connector configurations.</p>
    <p num="p-0007">U.S. Pat. No. 5,759,067 entitled “Shielded Connector” to Scheer (hereinafter “Scheer”) exemplifies a common prior art approach. In this configuration, one or more PCBs are disposed within the connector housing in a vertical planar orientation such that an inner face of the PCB is directed toward an interior of the assembly and an outer face directed toward an exterior of the assembly. This is best shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 of Scheer. The arrangement of Scheer, however, is not optimal from space usage and electrical performance standpoints, in that when the components are disposed on the PCBs on the inner face (see FIG. 6 of Scheer), they are in close proximity to the majority of run of the jack (and to some degree modular plug) conductors, thereby allowing for significant cross-talk and EMI opportunity there between.</p>
    <p num="p-0008">Alternatively, if all or the preponderance of the components are disposed on the external or outward side of the vertical PCB (see, e.g., FIG. 4 of Scheer), significant space is wasted in the interior volume of the connector, thereby forcing the designer to either utilize smaller and/or fewer components in their design to fit within a prescribed housing profile, and/or utilize a larger housing or thinner walls to generate more interior volume. Stated differently, the ratio of usable volume to total volume within the connector is not optimized.</p>
    <p num="p-0009">Another disability with prior art connector arrangements relates to their visual indication systems. Prior art systems generally use one of two arrangements comprising either LEDs which are directly viewable by the user from the front face of the connector, or optically transmissive conduits (e.g., light pipes) which transfer the light energy from the LED to the front face of the connector. A common problem relates to enclosure of the LED within the connector housing (and hence often the external noise shield). This arrangement increases the level of radiated noise within the housing, and therefore the level of noise and cross-talk present in the signal. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 6,368,159 issued Apr. 9, 2002 to Hess, et al. Various schemes have been utilized to place the comparatively “noisy” LEDs outside the external noise shield, but many of these are unwieldy and are not well suited to multi-port connector arrangements. Many prior art solutions also require the LEDs or light sources to be disposed on or near the parent substrate (PCB). See for example U.S. Pat. No. 5,876,239 issued Mar. 2, 1999 to Morin, et al. Furthermore, many arrangements treat each LED individually, thereby necessitating significant amounts of labor in manufacture.</p>
    <p num="p-0010">Based on the foregoing, it would be most desirable to provide an improved connector apparatus and method of manufacturing the same. Such improved apparatus would ideally be highly efficient at using the interior volume of the connector as compared to prior art solutions, mitigate cross-talk and EMI to a high degree, and allow for the use of a variety of different components (including light sources) with the connector assembly at once, thereby reducing labor cost. Furthermore, such improved connector apparatus would have an indication arrangement which facilitates low radiated noise and cross-talk, yet is cost-effective to manufacture.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0011">In a first aspect of the invention, an improved connector assembly for use on, inter alia, a printed circuit board or other device is disclosed. The connector includes at least one substrate (e.g., circuit board) disposed in substantially vertical and orthogonal orientation to the front face of the connector. In one exemplary embodiment, the assembly comprises a connector housing having a single port pair (i.e., two modular plug recesses), a plurality of conductors disposed within the recesses for contact with the terminals of the modular plug, and at least one component substrate disposed in the rear portion of the housing, the component substrates having at least one electronic component disposed thereon and in the electrical pathway between the conductors and the corresponding circuit board leads. The substantially orthogonal orientation of the board(s) allows maximum space efficiency with minimal noise and cross-talk.</p>
    <p num="p-0012">In a second exemplary embodiment, the assembly comprises a connector housing having a plurality of connector recesses arranged in port pairs, the recesses arranged in over-under and side-by-side orientation. A plurality of substrates arranged within each of the respective rear portions associated with each connector recess are also provided. The conductors associated with a first recess are disposed at their termination point on a first of the plurality of substrates, while the conductors associated with a second recess formed immediately over (or under) the first are disposed at their termination point on a second of the plurality of substrates, thereby allowing each of the respective recesses to have its own discrete substrate (optionally with electronic components thereon), and providing enhanced electrical separation, use of space within the connector, and ease of connector assembly.</p>
    <p num="p-0013">In a second aspect of the invention, the connector assembly further includes a plurality of light sources (e.g., light-emitting diodes, or LEDs) adapted for viewing by an operator during operation. The light sources advantageously permit the operator to determine the status of each of the individual connectors simply by viewing the front of the assembly. In one exemplary embodiment, the connector assembly comprises a single recess (port) having two LEDs disposed relative to the recess and adjacent to the modular plug latch formed therein, such that the LEDs are readily viewable from the front of the connector assembly. The LED conductors (two per LED) are mated with the substrate(s) within the rear of the housing, and ultimately to the circuit board or other external device to which the connector assembly is mounted. In another embodiment, the LED conductors comprise continuous electrodes which terminate directly to the printed circuit board/external device. A multi-port embodiment having a plurality of modular plug recesses arranged in row-and-column fashion, and a pair of LEDs per recess, is also disclosed.</p>
    <p num="p-0014">In another exemplary embodiment, the light sources comprise a “light pipe” arrangement wherein an optically conductive medium is used to transmit light of the desired wavelength(s) from a remote light source (e.g., LED) to the desired viewing location on the connector. In one variant, the light source comprises an LED which is disposed substantially on the substrate or device upon which the connector assembly is ultimately mounted, the location of the LED corresponding to a recess formed in the bottom portion of the connector, wherein the optically conductive medium receives light energy directly from the LED. In another exemplary variant, the light pipe arrangement comprises a plurality of light pipes adapted for use in a multi-port connector, the light pipes being aggregated or ganged into a unitary assembly along with the light sources. The assembly is optionally made installable/removable as a whole, and with the exception of portions of the distal portions of the light pipes, is disposed completely outside of the external connector noise shield. In another embodiment, the light sources are removable as a unit from the light pipe assembly while the latter is installed on the connector.</p>
    <p num="p-0015">In a third aspect of the invention, an improved electronic assembly utilizing the aforementioned connector assembly is disclosed. In one exemplary embodiment, the electronic assembly comprises the foregoing connector assembly which is mounted to a printed circuit board (PCB) substrate having a plurality of conductive traces formed thereon, and bonded thereto using a soldering process, thereby forming a conductive pathway from the traces through the conductors of the respective connectors of the package. In another embodiment, the connector assembly is mounted on an intermediary substrate, the latter being mounted to a PCB or other component using a reduced footprint terminal array. An external noise shield is also optionally applied to mitigate external EMI.</p>
    <p num="p-0016">In a fourth aspect of the invention, an improved method of manufacturing the connector assembly of the present invention is disclosed. The method generally comprises the steps of forming an assembly housing having at least one modular plug receiving recess and a rear cavity disposed therein; providing a plurality of conductors comprising a first set adapted for use within the recess of the housing element so as to mate with corresponding conductors of a modular plug; providing at least one substrate having at least one electrical pathway formed thereon, and adapted for receipt within the rear cavity; terminating one end of the conductors of the set to the substrate; providing a second set of conductors adapted for termination to the substrate and to the external device (e.g., circuit board) to which the connector will be mated; terminating the second set of conductors to the substrate, thereby forming an electrical pathway from the modular plug (when inserted in the recess) through at least one of the conductors of the first set to the distal end of at least one of the conductors of the second set; and inserting the assembled first conductors, substrate, and second conductors into the cavity within the housing. In another embodiment of the method, one or more electronic components are mounted on the substrate(s), thereby providing an electrical pathway from the modular plug terminals through the electronic component(s) to the distal ends of the second terminals.</p>
    <p num="p-0017">In a fifth aspect of the invention, an improved method of manufacturing an indicator assembly is disclosed. The method generally comprises: forming a unitary assembly having a plurality of individual conduits, a frame, and a light source recess; forming a light source carrier adapted to receive a plurality of light sources, and fit within the recess; providing a plurality of light sources; inserting the light sources within the carrier; and inserting the carrier within the recess, thereby forming the light conduit assembly. In one exemplary embodiment, the method further comprises forming the carrier from an optically opaque material, and the act of inserting comprises sliding the conductors of the light sources into grooves formed in the frame, and then rotating the carrier into the recess. In another exemplary embodiment, the method comprises mating two substantially identical assemblies in side-by-side fashion so as to form a single unitary indicator assembly.</p>
    <p num="p-0018">In a sixth aspect of the invention, an improved method of manufacturing a connector with integral indicator assembly is disclosed. The method generally comprises: forming a multi-port connector assembly having a housing, conductors, and at least one internal substrate; providing an external noise shield adapted to fit over at least portions of the housing; installing the noise shield over the housing; forming a unitary assembly having a plurality of individual conduits, a frame, and a light source recess; forming a light source carrier adapted to receive a plurality of light sources, and fit within the recess; providing a plurality of light sources; inserting the light sources within the carrier; inserting the carrier within the recess; and mating the indicator assembly with the connector housing.</p>

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading> <p num="p-0046">Reference is now made to the drawings wherein like numerals refer to like parts throughout.</p>
    <p num="p-0047">It is noted that while the following description is cast primarily in terms of a plurality of RJ-type connectors and associated modular plugs of the type well known in the art, the present invention may be used in conjunction with any number of different connector types. Accordingly, the following discussion of the RJ connectors and plugs is merely exemplary of the broader concepts.</p>
    <p num="p-0048">As used herein, the terms “electrical component” and “electronic component” are used interchangeably and refer to components adapted to provide some electrical function, including without limitation inductive reactors (“choke coils”), transformers, filters, gapped core toroids, inductors, capacitors, resistors, operational amplifiers, and diodes, whether discrete components or integrated circuits, whether alone or in combination, as well as more sophisticated integrated circuits such as SoC devices, ASICs, FPGAs, DSPs, etc. For example, the improved toroidal device disclosed in Assignee's co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/661,628 entitled “Advanced Electronic Microminiature Coil and Method of Manufacturing” filed Sep. 13, 2000, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, may be used in conjunction with the invention disclosed herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0049">As used herein, the term “signal conditioning” or “conditioning” shall be understood to include, but not be limited to, signal voltage transformation, filtering, current limiting, sampling, processing, and time delay.</p>
    <p num="p-0050">As used herein, the term “port pair” refers to an upper and lower modular connector (port) which are in a substantially over-under arrangement; i.e., one port disposed substantially atop the other port.</p>
    <p num="h-0006">Single Port Pair Embodiment</p>
    <p num="p-0051">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref> <i>a</i>-<b>1</b> <i>c</i>, a first embodiment of the connector assembly of the present invention is described. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref> <i>a</i>-<b>1</b> <i>c</i>, the assembly <b>100</b> generally comprises a connector housing element <b>102</b> having two modular plug-receiving connectors <b>104</b> formed therein. The front wall <b>106</b> <i>a </i>of the connectors <b>104</b> is further disposed generally perpendicular or orthogonal to the PCB surface (or other device) to which the connector assembly <b>100</b> is mounted, with the latch mechanism located away from the PCB, such that modular plugs may be inserted into the plug recesses <b>112</b> formed in the connectors <b>104</b> without physical interference with the PCB. The plug recesses <b>112</b> are adapted to each receive one modular plug (not shown) having a plurality of electrical conductors disposed therein in a predetermined array, the array being so adapted to mate with respective conductors <b>120</b> <i>a </i>present in the recesses <b>112</b> thereby forming an electrical connection between the plug conductors and connector conductors <b>120</b> <i>a</i>, as described in greater detail below. The connector housing element <b>102</b> is in the illustrated embodiment electrically non-conductive and is formed from a thermoplastic (e.g. PCT Thermex, IR compatible, UL94V-0), although it will recognized that other materials, polymer or otherwise, may conceivably be used. An injection molding process is used to form the housing element <b>102</b>, although other processes may be used, depending on the material chosen. The selection and manufacture of the housing element is well understood in the art, and accordingly will not be described further herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0052">Also formed generally within each recess <b>112</b> in the housing element <b>102</b> are a plurality of grooves <b>122</b> which are disposed generally parallel and oriented substantially horizontally within the housing <b>102</b>. The grooves <b>122</b> are spaced and adapted to guide and receive the aforementioned conductors <b>120</b> used to mate with the conductors of the respective modular plug. The conductors <b>120</b> are formed in a predetermined shape and held within an electronic component substrate assembly <b>130</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> <i>c</i>), the latter also mating with the housing element <b>102</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> <i>b</i>. Specifically, the housing element <b>102</b> includes a cavity <b>134</b> formed in the back of the connector <b>104</b> generally adjacent to the rear wall, the cavity <b>134</b> being adapted to receive the component substrate assemblies <b>130</b> in a substantially vertical orientation, with the plane of the primary substrate <b>131</b> being substantially parallel with the direction of run of the primary conductors <b>120</b> <i>a </i>(i.e., front-to-back). The cavity <b>134</b> is also sized in depth by approximately the width of the primary substrate <b>131</b> such that the substrate assembly sits somewhat off-center. The first conductors <b>120</b> <i>a </i>of the substrate/component assembly <b>130</b> are deformed such that when the assembly <b>130</b> is inserted into its cavity <b>134</b>, the upper conductors <b>120</b> <i>a </i>are received within the grooves <b>122</b>, maintained in position to mate with the conductors of the modular plug when the latter is received within the plug recess <b>112</b>. Second conductors <b>120</b> <i>b </i>are also provided formatting to the PCB. The offset position of the substrate <b>131</b> allows any electrical components disposed thereon to fit entirely within the cavity <b>134</b>, thereby allowing for a “standard” connector housing profile, and further allows the simultaneous placement of two assemblies <b>130</b> within the housing at the same time (including the electrical components associated with each, if provided), one for the upper connector, and one for the lower connector. Note, however, that electrical components may be disposed on either or both sides of the primary substrates <b>131</b> if desired, consistent with available room in the housing cavity (see, e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref> <i>d</i>-<b>2</b> <i>f</i>). For example, in one exemplary embodiment, the electrical components mounted on each primary substrate are divided into two general groups for purposes of electrical isolation; e.g., resistors and capacitors are disposed on one side of the primary substrate, while the magnetics (e.g., choke coils, toroid core transformers, etc) are disposed on the other side of the primary substrate. The electrical components are further encapsulated in silicon or similar encapsulant for both mechanical stability and electrical isolation.</p>
    <p num="p-0053">One advantageous feature of the arrangement of the first conductors <b>120</b> <i>a </i>of the respective substrates is that a significant portion of each first conductor is not in proximity and does not “overlap” with the corresponding first conductor of the other substrate in the port pair, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> <i>d</i>. Specifically, when viewed from directly above, significant portions of each conductor's run does not overlap with that of its corresponding conductor on the other substrate <b>131</b>. This pattern as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> <i>d </i>provides enhanced electrical separation, especially since it helps to avoid almost completely parallel straight runs of conductors as in Scheer previously described herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0054">It will be recognized that while the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref> <i>a</i>-<b>1</b> <i>c </i>includes a single port pair (i.e., two modular jacks), the invention may be practiced if desired with only one modular port, and one associated set of first and second conductors, primary substrate, etc. In such case, a single primary substrate and components disposed thereon would be disposed within the connector cavity, the primary substrate being offset from the fore-to-aft centerline of the port so as to accommodate the maximum amount of components possible. Such a single-port device may be used, for example, where a large amount (volumetrically) of signal conditioning electronics is required in support of a single port, or where the modular plug recess must be substantially elevated above the PCB or other device to which the connector assembly is mounted. Typically, however, it is anticipated that the port paired embodiments (such as those of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref> <i>a</i>-<b>1</b> <i>c </i>and <b>2</b> <i>a</i>-<b>2</b> <i>g</i>) will be utilized.</p>

    <p num="p-0055">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref> <i>a</i>-<b>2</b> <i>c</i>, a second embodiment of the connector assembly of the present invention is described. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref> <i>a</i>-<b>2</b> <i>c</i>, the assembly <b>200</b> generally comprises a connector housing element <b>202</b> having a plurality of individual connectors <b>204</b> formed therein. Specifically, the connectors <b>204</b> are arranged in the illustrated embodiment in side-by-side row fashion within the housing <b>202</b> such that two rows <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> of connectors <b>204</b> are formed, one disposed atop the other (“row-and-column”). The front walls <b>206</b> <i>a </i>of each individual connector <b>204</b> are further disposed parallel to one another and generally coplanar, such that modular plugs (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> <i>a</i>) may be inserted into the plug recesses <b>212</b> formed in each connector <b>204</b> simultaneously without physical interference. The plug recesses <b>212</b> are each adapted to receive one modular plug (not shown) having a plurality of electrical conductors disposed therein in a predetermined array, the array being so adapted to mate with respective conductors <b>220</b> <i>a </i>present in each of the recesses <b>212</b> thereby forming an electrical connection between the plug conductors and connector conductors <b>220</b> <i>a</i>, as described in greater detail below.</p>
    <p num="p-0056">As in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref> <i>a</i>-<b>1</b> <i>c </i>above, a plurality of grooves <b>222</b> which are disposed generally parallel and oriented vertically within the housing <b>202</b> are formed generally within the recess <b>212</b> of each connector <b>204</b> in the housing element <b>202</b>. The grooves <b>222</b> are spaced and adapted to guide and receive the aforementioned conductors <b>220</b> used to mate with the conductors <b>216</b> of the modular plug. The conductors <b>220</b> are formed in a predetermined shape and held within one of a plurality (e.g., two) of electronic component substrate assemblies <b>230</b>, <b>232</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> <i>c</i>), the latter also mating with the housing element <b>202</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> <i>b</i>. Specifically, the housing element <b>202</b> includes a plurality of cavities <b>234</b> formed in the back of respective connectors <b>204</b> generally adjacent to the rear wall of each connector <b>204</b>, each cavity <b>234</b> being adapted to receive the component substrate assemblies <b>230</b>, <b>232</b> in tandem, complementary fashion. The cavities <b>234</b> are also sized in depth by approximately the width of the two primary substrates <b>231</b> such that the substrate assemblies sit in side-by-side arrangement, the left-hand assembly <b>232</b> (as viewed from the rear of the connector assembly housing <b>202</b>) providing the first conductors <b>220</b> <i>a </i>to the upper row port, and the right-hand assembly <b>230</b> providing the first conductors to bottom row port for the same port pair. The first conductors <b>220</b> <i>a </i>of the substrate/component assemblies <b>230</b>, <b>232</b> are deformed such that when the assemblies <b>230</b>, <b>232</b> is inserted into its respective cavity <b>234</b>, the upper conductors <b>220</b> <i>a </i>are received within the grooves <b>222</b>, maintained in position to mate with the conductors of the modular plug when the latter is received within the plug recess <b>212</b>, and also maintained in electrical separation by the separators <b>223</b> disposed between and defining the grooves <b>222</b>. When installed, the respective primary substrates are in a substantially vertical alignment, and are oriented “face to face” such that the components on each respective substrate are disposed within the cavity for that port pair (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> <i>b</i>).</p>
    <p num="p-0057">The substrate assemblies <b>230</b>, <b>232</b> are retained within their cavities <b>234</b> substantially by way of friction with the housing element <b>202</b> and the capture of the second (lower) conductors <b>220</b> <i>b </i>by the secondary substrate (described below), although other methods and arrangements may be substituted with equal success. The illustrated approach allows for easy insertion of the completed substrate assemblies <b>230</b>, <b>232</b> into the housing <b>202</b>, and subsequent selective removal if desired.</p>
    <p num="p-0058">It will also be recognized that positioning or retaining elements (e.g., “contour” elements, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,116,963 entitled “Two Piece Microelectronic Connector and Method” issued Sep. 12, 2000, assigned to the Assignee hereof), and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, may optionally be utilized as part of the housing element <b>202</b> of the present invention. These positioning or retaining elements are used, inter alia, to position the individual first conductors <b>220</b> <i>a </i>with respect to the modular plug(s) received within the recess(es), and thereby provide a mechanical pivot point or fulcrum for the first conductors <b>220</b> <i>a</i>. Additionally or in the alternative, these elements may act as retaining devices for the conductors <b>220</b> <i>a </i>and its associated primary substrate <b>231</b> thereby providing a frictional retaining force which opposes removal of the substrate <b>231</b> and conductors from the housing <b>202</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> <i>h </i>illustrates the use of such contour elements within an exemplary connector body. The construction of such elements is well known in the art, and accordingly not described further herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0059">In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref> <i>a</i>-<b>2</b> <i>c</i>, the two rows of connectors <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> are disposed relative to one another such that the upper conductors <b>220</b> <i>a </i>of the packages <b>230</b> associated with the top row <b>208</b> are slightly different in shape and length than those associated with the packages <b>232</b> for the bottom row <b>210</b>. This difference in shape and length is largely an artifact of having the distal ends <b>229</b> of the upper conductors <b>220</b> <i>a </i>mate with equivalent locations on the tandem substrate assemblies <b>230</b>, <b>232</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0060">Also in the illustrated embodiment, the first (upper) conductors <b>220</b> <i>a </i>of each substrate assembly <b>230</b>, <b>232</b> are displaced away from each other after egress from the separator element <b>223</b> to minimize electrical coupling and “cross-talk” there between. Specifically, as the length of the upper conductors <b>220</b> <i>a </i>grows longer, the associated capacitance also increases, and hence the opportunity for cross-talk. The displacement of the first conductors <b>220</b> <i>a </i>from each other in the present invention adds more distance between the conductors of that port pair, thereby reducing the field strength and accordingly the cross-talk there between.</p>
    <p num="p-0061">In another variant of the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref> <i>a</i>-<b>2</b> <i>c </i>(not shown), the upper conductors <b>220</b> <i>a </i>are fashioned such that at least a portion of the conductors (e.g., two of the eight total in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref> <i>a</i>-<b>2</b> <i>c</i>) are displaced in the vertical direction for at least a portion of their run, thereby minimizing “crosstalk” as is well known in the electrical arts. Such displaced conductors may be contiguous (e.g., the two adjacent conductors at either edge <b>270</b> of the conductor set), or non-contiguous (e.g., one conductor at either edge, one conductor at one edge, and one non-edge conductor, etc.) as required by the particular application.</p>
    <p num="p-0062">It is further noted that while the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref> <i>a</i>-<b>2</b> <i>c </i>comprises two rows <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> of six connectors <b>204</b> each (thereby forming a 2 by 6 array of connectors), other array configurations may be used. For example, a 2 by 2 array comprising two rows of two connectors each could be substituted. Alternatively, a 2 by 8 arrangement could be used. As another alternative, three rows of four connectors per row (i.e., 3 by 4) may be used. As yet another alternative, an asymmetric arrangement may be used, such as by having two rows with an unequal number of connectors in each row (e.g., two connectors in the top row, and four connectors in the bottom row). The modular plug recesses <b>212</b> (and front faces <b>206</b> <i>a</i>) of each connector also need not necessarily be coplanar as in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref> <i>a</i>-<b>2</b> <i>c</i>. Furthermore, certain connectors in the array need not have primary substrates/electronic components, or alternatively may have components disposed on the primary substrates different than those for other connectors in the same array.</p>
    <p num="p-0063">As yet another alternative, the connector configurations within the connector housing may be heterogeneous or hybridized. For example, one or more of the upper/lower row port pairs may utilize configurations which are different, such as the use of the substantially vertical complementary primary substrate pairs as described above with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for some port pairs, and the use of the component package (e.g., interlock base) configuration described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,193,560 entitled “Connector Assembly with Side-by-Side Terminal Arrays” issued Feb. 27, 2001, co-owed by the Assignee hereof and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, for other port pairs.</p>
    <p num="p-0064">Many other permutations are possible consistent with the invention; hence, the embodiments shown herein are merely illustrative of the broader concept.</p>
    <p num="p-0065">The rows <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> of the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref> <i>a</i>-<b>1</b> <i>c </i>and <b>2</b> <i>a</i>-<b>2</b> <i>c </i>are oriented in mirror-image fashion, such that the latching mechanism <b>250</b> for each connector <b>204</b> in the top row <b>208</b> is reversed or mirror-imaged from that of its corresponding connector in the bottom row <b>210</b>. This approach allows the user to access the latching mechanism <b>250</b> (in this case, a flexible tab and recess arrangement of the type commonly used on RJ modular jacks, although other types may be substituted) of both rows <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> with the minimal degree of physical interference. It will be recognized, however, that the connectors within the top and bottom rows <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> may be oriented identically with respect to their latching mechanisms <b>250</b>, such as having all the latches of both rows of connectors disposed at the top of the plug recess <b>212</b>, if desired.</p>
    <p num="p-0066">The connector assembly <b>200</b> of the invention further comprises a single secondary substrate <b>260</b> which is disposed in the illustrated embodiment on the bottom face of the connector assembly <b>200</b> adjacent to the PCB or external device to which the assembly <b>100</b> is ultimately mounted (FIG. <b>4</b>). The substrate comprises, in the illustrated embodiment, at least one layer of fiberglass <b>262</b>, although other arrangements and materials may be used. The substrate <b>260</b> further includes a plurality of conductor perforation arrays <b>268</b> formed at predetermined locations on the substrate <b>260</b> with respect to the second (lower) conductors <b>220</b> <i>b </i>of each primary substrate assembly <b>230</b> such that when the connector assembly <b>100</b> is fully assembled, the second conductors <b>220</b> <i>b </i>penetrate the substrate <b>260</b> via respective ones of the aperture arrays <b>268</b>. This arrangement advantageously provides mechanical stability and registration for the lower conductors <b>220</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0067"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref> <i>d</i>-<b>2</b> <i>f </i>illustrates various aspects of the connector of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref> <i>a</i>-<b>2</b> <i>c</i>, as assembled in a working device.</p>
    <p num="p-0068">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> <i>g</i>, one exemplary embodiment of a conductor carrier device optionally used with the connector assemblies of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref> <i>g </i>above is described. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> <i>g</i>, the carrier <b>280</b> comprises a molded (e.g., polymer) “clip” which has a plurality of substantially aligned grooves <b>282</b> formed on one side thereof. The grooves <b>282</b> are sized and spaced so as to generally coincide with that portion of the first or upper conductors <b>220</b> <i>a </i>for the insert assembly with which the carrier <b>280</b> is associated, the conductors <b>220</b> <i>a </i>being received in respective ones of said grooves <b>282</b>. In one variant, each of the conductors <b>220</b> <i>a </i>is frictionally received within its respective groove, thereby maintaining the relative positions of the conductors and the carrier <b>280</b>, although it will be recognized that the adhesives or other means may be used to retain at least a portion of the conductors within their respective grooves. In another variant, the carrier assembly is comprised of two half-pieces which fit together (e.g., snap-fit) around the conductors. It will be recognized that yet other approaches may be used, such as for example molding of the carrier onto the conductors after the latter have been formed to the desired shape and/or installed in the desired orientation within the insert assembly, or alternatively molding the carrier assembly, and routing the conductors through apertures formed in the carrier, thereby deforming them at least in part.</p>
    <p num="p-0069">The carrier of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> <i>g </i>is generally planar in profile such that it receives conductors in generally side-by-side fashion, yet does not significantly increase the effective height <b>286</b> of the combined conductors and carrier. This “low profile” of the carrier <b>280</b> reduces the space required thereby within the cavity of the connector housing, thereby allowing more room for other components, as well as providing electrical separation between (i) the individual conductors <b>220</b> <i>a </i>in a given set, and (ii) the conductors <b>220</b> <i>a </i>of the two sets associated with each of the connectors in a port pair. It also allows the thickness of the carrier to be adjusted to help maintain a desired vertical spacing between the first conductors of the two connectors in a port pair. The carrier <b>280</b> is also ideally shaped such that it accommodates the desired portion <b>288</b> of the conductors <b>220</b> <i>a </i>without requiring significant additional area; i.e., its shape is substantially conformal to that of the conductors <b>220</b> <i>a </i>as a whole.</p>
    <p num="p-0070">It will be further recognized that the substantially planar configuration of the carrier <b>280</b> lends itself to being received within corresponding recesses or apertures (not shown) formed within the housing element <b>202</b>. For example, a recess or aperture may be formed in the housing and shaped to receive the carrier <b>280</b> when the latter is clipped onto the first conductors <b>220</b> <i>a</i>, thereby adding additional rigidity.</p>
    <p num="p-0071">Lastly, it will be recognized that while the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref> <i>a</i>-<b>2</b> <i>c </i>are so-called “latch-up/down” variants, with the modular plug latch for the top row of connectors disposed at the top of the connector housing <b>202</b>, and latch for the bottom row of connectors at the bottom of the housing <b>202</b>, thereby avoiding mutual interference of the latches when the user attempts to operate them, the invention may alternatively be embodied with other configurations, such as (i) both latches “down”; (ii) both latches up, or (iii)a “latch-down/up” configuration. The modifications to the embodiments previously shown herein to effect such alternate configurations are within the skill of the ordinary artisan, and accordingly are not described further herein.</p>
    <p num="h-0008">Connector Assembly with Light Sources</p>
    <p num="p-0072">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref> <i>a</i>-<b>3</b> <i>c</i>, yet another embodiment of the connector assembly of the present invention is described. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref> <i>a</i>-<b>3</b> <i>c</i>, the connector assembly <b>300</b> further comprises a plurality of light sources <b>303</b>, presently in the form of light emitting diodes LEDs of the type well known in the art. The light sources <b>303</b> are used to indicate the status of the electrical connection within each connector, as is well understood. The LEDs <b>303</b> of the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref> <i>a</i>-<b>3</b> <i>c </i>are disposed at the bottom edge <b>309</b> of the bottom row <b>310</b> and the top edge <b>314</b> of the top row <b>308</b>, two LEDs per connector adjacent to and on either side of the modular plug latch mechanism <b>350</b>, so as to be visible from the front face of the connector assembly <b>300</b>. The individual LEDs <b>303</b> are, in the present embodiment, received within recesses <b>344</b> formed in the front face of the housing element <b>302</b>. The LEDs each include two conductors <b>311</b> which run from the rear of the LED to the rear portion of the connector housing element <b>302</b> generally in a horizontal direction within lead channels <b>347</b> formed in the housing element <b>302</b>. The LED conductors <b>311</b> are sized and deformed at such an angle towards their distal ends <b>317</b> such that they can either (i) mate with respective apertures formed on the primary substrate(s) associated with each modular plug port, the conductors then being in electrical communication with respective second conductors disposed at the other end of the primary substrate, (ii) run uninterrupted to the secondary substrate (i.e., one continuous conductor), and penetrate therethrough and emerge from corresponding apertures <b>319</b> formed in the secondary substrate <b>360</b>, generally parallel to the second conductors <b>220</b> <i>b </i>held within the lower end of the primary substrate, or (iii) run directly from the LED to the PCB/external device without regard to or interaction with the secondary substrate. These three alternatives are illustrates in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref> <i>b </i>and <b>3</b> <i>c</i>. It will be recognized that while <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref> <i>b </i>and <b>3</b> <i>c </i>show various alternatives for LED conductor routing, only one option will be used in any given connector assembly, although it is feasible to mix the various approaches within one device. The LED conductors <b>311</b> may also optionally be frictionally received in complementary horizontal or vertical grooves <b>397</b> formed in the connector housing, such that the LED conductors are more positively registered with respect to the second conductors <b>220</b> <i>b</i>, thereby facilitating insertion through the secondary substrate and/or PCB/external device.</p>
    <p num="p-0073">Similarly, a set of complementary grooves (not shown) may be formed if desired, such grooves terminating on the bottom face of the housing <b>302</b> coincident with the conductors <b>311</b> for the LEDs of the bottom row of connectors. These allow the LED conductors to be received within their respective recesses <b>344</b>, and upon emergence from the rear end of the recess <b>344</b>, be deformed downward to be frictionally received within their respective grooves.</p>
    <p num="p-0074">The recesses <b>344</b> formed within the housing element <b>302</b> each encompass their respective LED when the latter is inserted therein, and securely hold the LED in place via friction between the LED <b>303</b> and the inner walls of the recess (not shown). Alternatively, a looser fit and adhesive may be used, or both friction and adhesive.</p>
    <p num="p-0075">As yet another alternative, the recess <b>344</b> may comprise only two walls, with the LEDs being retained in place primarily by their conductors <b>311</b>, which are frictionally received within grooves formed in the adjacent surfaces of the connector housing. This latter arrangement is illustrated most clearly in U.S. Pat. No. 6,325,664 entitled “Shielded Microelectronic Connector with Indicators and Method of Manufacturing” issued Dec. 4, 2001, and assigned to the Assignee hereof, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref> <i>d </i>and <b>3</b> <i>e </i>show an exemplary embodiment of a single port connector composed of, inter alia, a connector body <b>12</b> and indicating devices <b>14</b> <i>a-b</i>. The body <b>12</b> of the present embodiment further includes two channels <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> formed generally on the bottom comers <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> of the body <b>12</b>. The channels <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> are configured to receive indicating devices <b>14</b> <i>a-b</i>. In one embodiment, the indicating devices <b>14</b> <i>a-b </i>are light emitting diodes (LEDs) having a generally rectangular box-like shape. Two pairs of lead grooves <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> and a land <b>39</b> are formed on the exterior of the bottom wall <b>18</b>. The grooves <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> are in communication with their respective channels <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> and are of a size so as to frictionally receive the leads <b>40</b> of the LEDs <b>14</b>. The frictional fit of the leads <b>40</b> in the grooves <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> permits the LEDs to be retained within their respective channels without the need for other retaining devices or adhesives. It will be appreciated, however, that such additional retaining devices or adhesives may be desirable to add additional mechanical stability to the LEDs when installed or to replace the grooves altogether. Additionally, the lead <b>40</b> which lies in the groove <b>36</b> can be heat staked. The outer edge of each land <b>39</b> further optionally includes a recess <b>41</b> for retaining the outer LED lead <b>43</b> if a noise shield is installed around the connector body <b>12</b>. The aforementioned location of the channels <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, grooves <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, and lands <b>39</b> allows the leads <b>40</b> of the LEDs to be deformed downward at any desired angle or orientation such that they may be readily and directly mated with the circuit board <b>50</b> or other devices (not shown) while minimizing total lead length. Reduced lead length is desirable from both cost and radiated noise perspectives. The placement of the LEDs in the grooves <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> and channels <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> further permits the outer profile of the connector to be minimized, thereby economizing on space within the interior of any parent device in which the connector <b>10</b> is used.</p>
    <p num="p-0076">It will be noted that while channels <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, grooves <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, and lands <b>39</b> are described above, other types of forms and/or retaining devices, as well as locations therefore, may be used with the present invention. For example, the aforementioned indicating devices <b>14</b> can be mounted on the bottom surface of the connector using only adhesive and the grooves <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> to retain the leads <b>40</b> and align the devices <b>14</b>. Alternatively, the channels and grooves can be placed laterally across the bottom surface of the connector body <b>12</b> such that the indicating devices <b>14</b> are visible primarily from the side of the connector, or from the top of the connector. Many such permutations are possible and considered to be within the scope of the invention described herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0077">As yet another alternative, the external shield element <b>272</b> may be used to provide support and retention of the LEDs within the recesses <b>344</b>, the latter comprising three-sided channels into which the LEDs <b>303</b> fit. Many other configurations for locating and retaining the LEDs in position with respect to the housing element <b>302</b> may be used, such configurations being well known in the relevant art.</p>
    <p num="p-0078">The two LEDs <b>303</b> used for each connector <b>304</b> radiate visible light of the desired wavelength(s), such as green light from one LED and red light from the other, although multi-chromatic devices (such as a “white light” LED), or even other types of light sources, may be substituted if desired. For example, a light pipe arrangement such as that using an optical fiber or pipe to transmit light from a remote source to the front face of the connector assembly <b>300</b> may be employed. Many other alternatives such as incandescent lights or even liquid crystal (LCD) or thin film transistor (TFT) devices are possible, all being well known in the electronic arts.</p>
    <p num="p-0079">The connector assembly <b>300</b> with LEDs <b>303</b> may further be configured to include noise shielding for the individual LEDs if desired. Note that in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref> <i>a</i>-<b>3</b> <i>c</i>, the LEDs <b>303</b> are positioned inside of (i.e., on the connector housing side) of the external noise shield <b>272</b>. If it is desired to shield the individual connectors <b>304</b> and their associated conductors and component packages from noise radiated by the LEDs, such shielding may be included within the connector assembly <b>300</b> in any number of different ways. In one embodiment, the LED shielding is accomplished by forming a thin metallic (e.g., copper, nickel, or copper-zinc alloy) layer on the interior walls of the LED recesses <b>344</b> (or even over the non-conductive portions of LED itself) prior to insertion of each LED. In a second embodiment, a discrete shield element (not shown) which is separable from the connector housing <b>302</b> can be used, each shield element being formed so as to accommodate it's respective LED and also fit within its respective recess <b>344</b>. In yet another embodiment, the external noise shield <b>272</b> may be fabricated and deformed within the recesses <b>344</b> so as to accommodate the LEDs <b>303</b> on the outer surface of the shield, thereby providing noise separation between the LEDs and the individual connectors <b>304</b>. This latter approach is also described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6,325,664 entitled “Shielded Microelectronic Connector with Indicators and Method of Manufacturing” previously incorporated herein. Myriad other approaches for shielding the connectors <b>304</b> from the LEDs may be used as well if desired, with the only constraint being sufficient electrical separation between the LED conductors and other metallic components on the connector assembly to avoid electrical shorting.</p>
    <p num="p-0080"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates yet another embodiment of the connector assembly of the invention, wherein the light sources comprises a light pipe arrangement. Light pipes are generally known in the art; however, the arrangement of the present invention adapts the light pipe to the connector configurations otherwise disclosed herein. Specifically, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the illustrated embodiment comprises a two-row connector assembly (i.e., at least one upper row connector and at least one lower row connector) having one or more light pipe assemblies <b>410</b> associated therewith. For the upper row connector <b>402</b>, the light pipe assembly <b>410</b> <i>a </i>comprises an optically conductive medium <b>404</b> adapted to transmit the desired wavelength(s) of light energy from a light source <b>412</b>, in this case an LED. The LED <b>412</b> is disposed on the substrate to which the connector assembly is mounted, e.g., a PCB or other device. The LED <b>412</b> fits within a recess <b>414</b> formed within the bottom surface of the connector assembly which is adapted and sized to receive the LED. The recess <b>414</b> may also be coated internally with a reflective coating of the type well known in the art to enhance the reflection of light energy radiated by the LED during operation into the interior face <b>416</b> of the optical medium <b>404</b>. The optically conductive medium may comprise a single unitary light path from the interior face <b>416</b> to the viewing face <b>418</b>, or alternatively a plurality of abutted or joined optically transmissive segments. As yet another approach, one or more “ganged” optical fibers (e.g., single mode or multimode fibers of the type well known in the optical networking arts) may be used as the optical medium. As yet another alternative, a substantially prismatic device may be used as the optical medium <b>404</b>, especially if substantial chromatic dispersion is desired. The optical medium may be removably retained within the connector assembly housing <b>406</b>, or alternatively fixed in place (such as by being molded within the housing, or retained using an adhesive or friction), or any combination of the foregoing as desired.</p>
    <p num="p-0081">Similarly, while the light sources <b>412</b> of the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are disposed on the PCB or other device to which the connector assembly is mounted, it will be recognized that the light sources may be retained either fixedly or removably within the connector housing, such that the light sources are installed on the PCB/parent device simultaneously with the connector.</p>
    <p num="p-0082">The second light pipe assembly <b>410</b> <i>b </i>is disposed within the upper portion of the connector housing within a channel formed therein. It will be noted that due to the longer optical “run” and greater optical losses associated with this second optical medium <b>405</b>, the size/intensity of the LED <b>413</b>, and/or the optical properties or dimensions of the medium <b>405</b>, may optionally be adjusted so as to produce a luminosity substantially equivalent to that associated with the first light pipe assembly <b>410</b> <i>a </i>if desired.</p>
    <p num="p-0083">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the viewing faces <b>418</b> of the respective light pipe assemblies <b>410</b> <i>a</i>, <b>410</b> <i>b </i>are disposed at the bottom and top portions of the front face <b>425</b> of the connector housing <b>406</b>, generally adjacent to the latching mechanism <b>430</b> for the modular plug (not shown). It will be recognized, however, that all or portions of the light pipe assemblies may be disposed in other locations in the connector assembly <b>400</b>. For example, if desired, the optical media may be routed such that the viewing faces <b>418</b> associated with each light pipe are disposed centrally in the housing; i.e., generally at the intersection <b>432</b> of the bottom and top row connectors, regardless of whether a “latch apart” arrangement (i.e., latches disposed generally at opposite faces of the connector housing ) such as that of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is used or not.</p>
    <p num="p-0084">Similarly, it will be recognized that the placement of the light sources within the connector housing <b>406</b> may be varied. For example, the LEDs could be placed in a more central location on the bottom face <b>440</b> of the connector (not shown), in tandem or front-back arrangement, with the respective optical media being routed to the desired viewing face location. As yet another alternative, the top (rear) light sources could be placed remote from the PCB/parent device, such that it is disposed within the top rear wall area <b>442</b> of the connector housing, thereby allowing the use of a “straight run” of optical medium (not shown).</p>
    <p num="p-0085">It can also be appreciated that while the foregoing embodiment is described in terms of a two-row connector device, the light pipe assemblies of the invention may also be implemented in devices having greater or lesser numbers of rows.</p>
    <p num="p-0086">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref> <i>a</i>-<b>4</b> <i>g</i>, yet another embodiment of the improved connector assembly of the present invention is described. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> <i>a</i>, the fully assembled connector assembly <b>450</b> includes an optional external noise shield <b>452</b> disposed around the connector housing <b>453</b>, the latter being a 2×N arrangement (here, 2×4 for 8 total ports). The connector <b>450</b> further includes two visual indicator assemblies <b>454</b> disposed generally on the rear portion <b>455</b> of the connector housing, and largely external to the noise shield <b>452</b>. As best shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref> <i>b</i>-<b>4</b> <i>e</i>, the indicator assemblies <b>454</b> each comprise a plurality of individual optically transmissive conduits or “pipes” <b>456</b> disposed in a generally front-to-rear orientation, such that the conduits <b>456</b> are substantially parallel. The conduits <b>456</b> run over top of the internal connector primary substrates <b>231</b>, and are in the illustrated embodiment associated or disposed for viewing only with the top row of ports, although other configurations may be used. The indicator assemblies <b>454</b> are mated in dove-tailed, side-by-side fashion along the rear portion <b>455</b> of the connector, such that they generally form a contiguous plane along the back face <b>459</b> of the connector housing <b>453</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0087">The indicator assemblies <b>454</b> are comprised of the aforementioned conduits <b>456</b> and a frame element <b>460</b>, all of which in the present embodiment are collectively joined into a unitary component <b>461</b> through molding as one common piece, although other approaches (i.e., multi-part assemblies, and/or use of other formation processes) may be used. The unitary molded arrangement of the present embodiment advantageously reduces the cost of manufacturing the connector due to (i) low cost of injection or transfer molding processes, and (ii) obviating hand or machine labor associated with assembling a plurality of components. This arrangement also provides the assembly <b>454</b> with substantial rigidity and alignment for both the assembly <b>454</b> as a whole and the internal components of the assembly <b>454</b> (including the optical isolator/carrier and light sources), described in greater detail subsequently herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0088">The unitary component <b>461</b> is fabricated from a polymer which is substantially transmissive to light (i.e., transparent), at least in the desired direction of light flow from the terminal end of the conduit <b>456</b> to the distal end thereof. This mitigates optical losses resulting from the light propagation in the material, and helps maintain the maximal luminosity at the distal end (connector mating face) for ease of user recognition. It will be recognized, however, that other optically transmissive media (such as single- or multi-mode optical fiber and the like) may be used to provide optical transmission of light energy from the source <b>470</b> to the distal face. Molded transparent polymer has the distinct benefit of low cost and ease of manufacturing, however.</p>
    <p num="p-0089">The unitary light pipe/frame component <b>461</b> of the illustrated embodiment further includes a recess <b>462</b> adapted to receive a plurality of light sources <b>470</b> disposed within a light source carrier <b>468</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> <i>e</i>). The carrier <b>468</b> is received within the frame portion of the unitary component <b>461</b>, and is shaped so as to cooperate with the recess <b>462</b> to securely yet removably maintain the position of the carrier <b>468</b> (and enclosed light sources <b>470</b>). A plurality of substantially vertical conductor guides <b>472</b> are also provided within the frame <b>460</b>, which align and guide the conductors <b>471</b> of the light sources <b>470</b> when the latter are inserted into the frame <b>460</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the light sources <b>470</b> comprise three-wire LEDs of the type well known in the art, although other types of LEDs and light sources may be substituted.</p>
    <p num="p-0090">Referring now specifically to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> <i>e</i>, the exemplary carrier (and optical isolator) <b>468</b> of the illustrated embodiment is described in detail. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> <i>e</i>, the carrier <b>468</b> is generally longitudinal in shape, with a plurality of juxtaposed light source recesses <b>469</b> formed therein in a vertical orientation, such that when the head portion <b>473</b> of the light source <b>470</b> is received within a corresponding one of the recesses <b>469</b>, and the carrier <b>468</b> received in the frame <b>460</b>, the light source is vertically oriented with respect to the connector housing <b>453</b>. The carrier recesses <b>469</b> frictionally receive the LEDs; however, it will be recognized that other methods may be used to either removably or permanently retain the LEDs <b>470</b> in their recesses <b>469</b> as desired, including without limitation adhesives, heat staking, “snap” fit arrangements, etc.</p>
    <p num="p-0091">The carrier <b>468</b> is in the present embodiment also formed from an opaque material (in contrast to the substantially transparent material of the conduits/frame) so as to optically isolate the light from one LED <b>470</b> from an adjacent conduit <b>456</b>. Specifically, it is undesirable to have the light from one LED bleed into an adjacent light conduit, since this may either provide an erroneous indication to the user at the face of the connector, and/or generate constructive or destructive interference with the light generated by the LED associated with that adjacent conduit, thereby providing unpredictable and potentially deleterious effects. As another alternative, the interior and/or exterior surfaces of the carrier <b>468</b> may be coated with an optically opaque material (such as paint) to prevent light transmission. The side surfaces of the LED <b>470</b> may also be coated in this manner so as to permit light transmission only from the forward face <b>475</b> of the LED during operation. Myriad different ways of optically isolating the light sources <b>470</b> from unwanted transmission into adjacent conduits <b>456</b> may be used consistent with the invention as recognized by those of ordinary skill.</p>
    <p num="p-0092">The carrier <b>468</b> of the present embodiment is also advantageously configured to permit easy assembly and removal with respect to the frame <b>460</b>. Specifically, the assembly process involves simply inserting the head portion of each light source into it's respective recess <b>469</b> of the carrier <b>468</b>, and then inserting the carrier with light sources into its recess within the frame <b>460</b> as a unit such that the LED conductors are routed through the guides <b>472</b> within the frame. Alternatively, the LED conductors can be routed into their guides <b>472</b> by hand, and then the carrier fitted over top of the LED head portions and then subsequently rotated as an assembly into the frame <b>460</b>. Several possible methods of assembly are possible. It is noted that the carrier <b>468</b> of the illustrated embodiment is configured such that it can rotate and/or translate out of the plane of the indicator assembly frame <b>460</b> away from the back of the connector, thereby allowing installation/removal of the carrier while the indicator assembly <b>454</b> is mounted onto the back of the connector (assuming the LED leads are not tightly registered in the secondary or horizontal substrate <b>260</b>). Note that use of registration of the LED conductors within the secondary substrate <b>260</b> aids in alignment of these conductors during PCB mating, but is in no means necessary to practice the invention, and may be undesirable in circumstances where the easy removability of the indicator assembly is desired.</p>
    <p num="p-0093">As indicated above, the indicator assemblies <b>454</b> are in the illustrated embodiment dove-tailed or contoured to each other such that two adjacent assemblies <b>454</b> can mate to one another in side-by-side configuration and in a space-efficient manner. The indicator assemblies <b>454</b> (including light sources and light conduits) are aggregated in groups of four per assembly <b>454</b>, thereby allowing the user to add light sources/conduits in groups of four, such as in the case of a 2×8 connector, wherein four (2) assemblies <b>454</b> (with four light sources each would be used to provide one indicator for each port of the connector. It will be recognized, however, that the indicator assemblies of the present invention may be configured with any number of light sources. For example, in a 2×2 connector, a single indicator assembly having four light sources and conduits could be used, or alternatively two assemblies each having only two sources and conduits (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> <i>f</i>) could be used. Furthermore, not all the light source recesses <b>469</b> in a given assembly <b>454</b> or carrier <b>468</b> need be utilized.</p>
    <p num="p-0094">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> <i>g</i>, one exemplary embodiment of the connector housing <b>453</b> used in conjunction with the indicator assemblies <b>454</b> of the present invention is described. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> <i>g</i>, the housing <b>453</b> generally comprises a plurality of modular ports <b>480</b> disposed on its front face and an open back cavity <b>482</b> adapted to receive the substrates <b>231</b> and other internal components of the connector assembly. The housing further includes a plurality of risers or features <b>484</b> which are formed integral with the housing and have a rear surface <b>483</b> which is roughly co-planar with the rear face of the connector housing <b>453</b>. These risers <b>484</b> contain apertures <b>486</b> formed in their rear surfaces <b>483</b> adapted to receive corresponding ones of pins <b>487</b> formed on the indicator light assemblies <b>454</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref> <i>c </i>and <b>4</b> <i>d</i>). These apertures <b>486</b> correspond with apertures (not shown) formed in the external noise shield <b>452</b>. Hence, when the connector assembly is being assembled, the noise shield <b>452</b> is advantageously mounted onto the connector housing <b>453</b> before the indicator assembly <b>454</b> is mated to the housing <b>453</b> via the pins <b>487</b>, thereby maintaining the light sources and their conductors completely outside the shielded volume. Channels <b>488</b> formed in the upper portion <b>489</b> of the housing <b>453</b> receive corresponding ones of the distal and central portions of the conduits <b>456</b>, these channels <b>488</b> also having corresponding apertures formed in the external noise shield <b>452</b> to allow subsequent insertion/removal thereof. This underscores two major advantages of the present invention, namely (i) that the “noisy” light sources and conductors associated therewith are kept effectively outside the shielded volume (or at minimum further away from the signal path components if no external shield is used); and (ii) the indicator assembly(ies) <b>454</b> are attachable and removable after the connector is assembled and the noise shield <b>452</b> is attached.</p>
    <p num="p-0095">Furthermore, the disposition of the distal portions of the conduits <b>456</b> along one row (e.g., top) of ports in the illustrated embodiment provides significant space efficiency, since the connector housing dimensions may be accordingly reduced to avoid the additional thickness need for an additional row of indicators as is common with prior art multi-port, multi-row modular connectors. Hence, it will be appreciated that the embodiment of the housing <b>453</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> <i>g </i>is somewhat asymmetric, in that it has indicator apertures (and light pipes) disposed only atop the top row, and no others.</p>
    <p num="p-0096">Similarly, it will be recognized that the arrangement of conduits <b>456</b> in the indicator assembly <b>454</b> can optionally be made such that adjacent ones of the conduits are mated or “ganged” together at their distal ends. This approach allows the connector housing <b>453</b> to be formed with a fewer number of separate channels <b>488</b>, since two mated conduits <b>456</b> can share one channel. Based on the design of the conduits <b>456</b> (including the shape and materials chosen), optical cross-talk or contamination between the two mated conduits is effectively non-existent, unlike electrical analogs (e.g., electrical signal-carrying conductors running in parallel).</p>
    <p num="p-0097">It will be appreciated that while the illustrated embodiment utilizes a pin/aperture arrangement for frictional coupling of the indicator frame <b>460</b> to the housing <b>453</b>, other means of attachment between the two components, whether moveable or permanent, may be used. For example, if no subsequent removal of the indicator assembly <b>454</b> is required, permanent connections such as heat-stakes or adhesive joints may be used to affix the indicator assembly <b>454</b> to the housing. Alternatively, snap-fit frictional couplings may be used if it is desired to be able to remove the indicator assembly <b>454</b> from the housing one or more times.</p>
    <p num="p-0098">Additionally, in an alternate embodiment (not shown), the indicator assembly <b>454</b> may be mated to the internal substrates <b>231</b>, <b>260</b> of the connector assembly and/or the insert assembly <b>494</b> so as to make the inserts <b>494</b>, substrates <b>231</b>, <b>260</b>, and indicator assembly <b>454</b> into one unitary assembly. This approach is useful where no external noise shield (or alternatively one which does not impede insertion of the foregoing unitary insert/indicator assembly into the housing) is used.</p>
    <p num="p-0099"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> <i>h </i>is a front perspective view of the connector of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> <i>a</i>, illustrating the configuration of the exemplary insert element <b>494</b>. This insert element <b>494</b> aligns the primary conductors of the two ports of each port pair (i.e., each over-under pair of connectors) when the connector is assembled using a plurality of grooves <b>495</b> formed therein, thereby placing the primary conductors in position for mating with the corresponding terminals of the modular plug (not shown). In the illustrated embodiment (also shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> <i>b</i>), these insert elements <b>494</b> are molded from a polymer and heat-staked into the housing <b>453</b> as is well known in the art. They are also adapted to cooperate with the primary substrates <b>231</b> disposed laterally on either side thereof, so as to add rigidity to the internal assembly of the connector. Corresponding features within the sidewalls of the housing <b>453</b> are also optionally used to align and restrain the inserts <b>494</b> when the latter are inserted into the former.</p>
    <p num="p-0100">It will be recognized that while described primarily in the context of the multi-port connector assembly of the present disclosure, the indicator assemblies <b>454</b> described herein may be used with other configurations of multi-port connector. Stated differently, the disposition and orientation of components internal to the connector (e.g., the vertical substrates <b>231</b>, etc.) are not determinative of the use of the indicator assembly, the latter being able to be adapted to many different connector configurations given the present disclosure and the skill of the ordinary artisan.</p>
    <p num="p-0101"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the connector assembly of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref> <i>a</i>-<b>1</b> <i>c </i>mounted to an external substrate, in this case a PCB. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the connector assembly <b>100</b> is mounted such that the lower conductors <b>120</b> penetrate through respective apertures <b>502</b> formed in the PCB <b>506</b>. The lower conductors are soldered to the conductive traces <b>508</b> immediately surrounding the apertures <b>502</b>, thereby forming a permanent electrical contact there between. Note that while a conductor/aperture approach is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, other mounting techniques and configurations may be used. For example, the lower conductors <b>120</b> may be formed in such a configuration so as to permit surface mounting of the connector assembly <b>100</b> to the PCB <b>506</b>, thereby obviating the need for apertures <b>502</b>. As another alternative, the connector assembly <b>100</b> may be mounted to an intermediary substrate (not shown), the intermediary substrate being mounted to the PCB <b>506</b> via a surface mount terminal array such as a ball grid array (BGA), pin grid array (PGA), or other non-surface mount technique. The footprint of the terminal array is reduced with respect to that of the connector assembly <b>100</b>, and the vertical spacing between the PCB <b>506</b> and the intermediary substrate adjusted such that other components may be mounted to the PCB <b>506</b> outside of the footprint of the intermediary substrate terminal array but within the footprint of the connector assembly <b>100</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0102">It will be further noted that each of the foregoing embodiments of the connector assembly of the invention may be outfitted with one or more internal noise/EMI shields in order to provide enhanced electrical separation and reduced noise between conductors and electronic components. For example, the shielding arrangement(s) described in applicants co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/732,098 entitled “Shielded Microelectronic Connector Assembly and Method of Manufacturing”, filed Dec. 6, 2000, and assigned to the Assignee hereof, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, may be used, whether alone or in conjunction with other such shielding methods.</p>
    <p num="p-0103"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> <i>a </i>illustrates one such exemplary embodiment of a shielded connector assembly, wherein a “top-to-bottom” shield element <b>550</b> disposed between the first conductors of the upper and lower connector ports of each port pair is used. Additionally, transverse shield elements <b>554</b> (i.e., having a substantially similar orientation as the substrates) may be used, both (i) between the substrates <b>231</b> of a given pore pair to help mitigate cross-talk and EMI between the components on the two substrates; and (ii) between adjacent substrates of two contiguous port pairs, thereby mitigating “cross-port pair” cross-talk and radiated EMI. Furthermore, a substrate shield <b>556</b> such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> <i>a</i>, can be used with the connector assembly, thereby mitigating noise primarily in directions normal to the parent PCB or device to which the connector assembly is mounted.</p>
    <p num="p-0104">It is noted that the terms “top-to-bottom” and “transverse” as used herein are also meant to include orientations which are not purely horizontal or vertical, respectively, with reference to the plane of the connector assembly. For example, one embodiment of the connector assembly of the invention (not shown) may comprise a plurality of individual connectors arranged in an array which is curved or non-linear with reference to a planar surface, such that the top-to-bottom noise shield would also be curved or non-linear to provide shielding between successive rows of connectors. Similarly, the transverse shield elements could be disposed in an orientation which is angled with respect to the vertical. Hence, the foregoing terms are in no way limiting of the orientations and/or shapes which the disclosed shield elements <b>550</b>, <b>554</b>, <b>556</b> may take.</p>
    <p num="p-0105">Similarly, while such shield elements are described herein in terms of a single, unitary component, it will be appreciated that the shield elements may comprise two or more sub-components that may be physically separable from each other. Hence, the present invention anticipates the use of “multi-part” shields.</p>
    <p num="p-0106">The top-to-bottom shield element <b>550</b> in the illustrated embodiment (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> <i>a</i>) is formed from a copper zinc alloy (260), temper H04, which is approximately 0.008 in. thick and plated with a bright 93%/7% tin-lead alloy (approximately 0.00008-0.00015 inch thick) over a matte nickel underplate (approximately 0.00005-0.00012 inch thick). However, other materials, constructions, and thickness values may be substituted depending on the particular application. The shield element <b>305</b> further includes two joints <b>558</b> disposed at either end of the element <b>550</b>, which cooperate with two lateral slots in the external shield (not shown) to couple the top-to-bottom shield element <b>550</b> to the external shield after the connector assembly has been fully assembled. The joints <b>558</b> are optionally soldered or otherwise in contact with the edges of the lateral slots in the external shield, thereby forming an electrically conductive path if desired. The shield element (or portions thereof) may also optionally be provided with a dielectric overcoat, such as a layer of Kapton™ polyimide tape.</p>
    <p num="p-0107">The top-to-bottom shield element <b>550</b> is in one embodiment received within a groove or slot (not shown) formed in the front face of the connector housing element <b>202</b> to a depth such that shielding between the top row of first conductors <b>220</b> <i>a </i>and bottom row of first conductors is accomplished. In the illustrated embodiment, the shield element <b>550</b> includes a retainer tab <b>560</b> which is formed by bending the outward edge of the shield element <b>550</b> at an angle with respect to the plane of the shield element <b>550</b> at the desired location. This arrangement allows the shield element <b>550</b> to be inserted within the slot to a predetermined depth, thereby reducing the potential for variation in the depth to which the shield element penetrates from assembly to assembly during manufacturing. It will be recognized, however, that other arrangements for positioning the top-to-bottom shield element <b>550</b> may be utilized, such as pins, detents, adhesives, etc., all of which are well known in the art.</p>
    <p num="p-0108">The connector assembly <b>200</b> of the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> <i>a </i>comprises a shield substrate <b>556</b> which is disposed in the illustrated embodiment on the bottom face of the connector assembly <b>200</b> adjacent to the PCB or substrate to which the assembly <b>200</b> is ultimately mounted. The shield substrate comprises, in the illustrated embodiment, at least one layer of fiberglass upon which a layer of tin-plated copper or other metallic shielding material is disposed. The exposed portions of both the fiberglass and metallic shield may also be optionally coated with a polymer for added stability and dielectric strength. The substrate <b>556</b> further includes a plurality of terminal pin perforation arrays <b>570</b> formed at predetermined locations on the substrate <b>556</b> with respect to the lower conductors <b>220</b> <i>b </i>of each primary substrate <b>231</b> such that when the connector assembly <b>200</b> is fully assembled, the lower conductors <b>220</b> <i>b </i>penetrate the substrate <b>556</b> via respective ones of the terminal pin arrays <b>570</b>. Provision for a pin or other element (not shown) connecting the metallic shield to the external noise shield (if so equipped) is also provided. In this manner, the shield elements are electrically coupled and ultimately grounded so as to avoid accumulation of electrostatic potential or other potentially deleterious effects.</p>
    <p num="p-0109">In the illustrated embodiment, the metallic shield layer <b>556</b> is etched or removed from the area <b>572</b> immediately adjacent and surrounding the terminal pin arrays <b>570</b>, thereby removing any potential for undesirable electrical shorting or conductance in that area. Hence, the lower conductors <b>220</b> <i>b </i>of each connector penetrate the substrate and only contact the non-conductive fiberglass layer of the substrate <b>556</b>, the latter advantageously providing mechanical support and positional registration for the lower conductors <b>220</b> <i>b</i>. It will be recognized that other constructions of the substrate shield <b>556</b> may be used, however, such as two layers of fiberglass with the metallic shield layer “sandwiched” between, or even other approaches.</p>
    <p num="p-0110">The metallic shield layer of the substrate <b>556</b> acts to shield the bottom face of the connector assembly <b>200</b> against electronic noise transmission. This obviates the need for an external metallic shield encompassing this portion of the connector assembly <b>200</b>, which can be very difficult to execute from a practical standpoint since the conductors <b>220</b> <i>b </i>occupy this region as well. Rather, the substrate <b>556</b> of the present invention provides shielding of the bottom portion of the connector assembly <b>200</b> with no risk of shorting from the lower conductors <b>220</b> <i>b </i>to an external shield, while also providing mechanical stability and registration for the lower conductors <b>220</b> <i>b. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0111">In an alternate embodiment, the shielded substrate <b>556</b> may comprise a single layer of metallic shielding material (such as copper alloy; approximately 0.005 in. thick), which has been formed to cover substantially all of the bottom surface of the connector assembly. As with the shield substrate previously described, the portion of the single metallic layer immediately adjacent the lower conductors <b>220</b> <i>b </i>has been removed to eliminate the possibility of electrical shorting to the shield. The shield of this alternative embodiment is also soldered or otherwise conductively joined to the external noise shield (if provided) to provide grounding for the former. This alternative embodiment has the advantage of simplicity of construction and lower manufacturing cost, since the fabrication of the single layer metallic is much simpler than its multi-layer counterpart of the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> <i>a. </i> </p>
    <p num="h-0009">Method of Manufacture</p>
    <p num="p-0112">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the method <b>600</b> of manufacturing the aforementioned connector assembly <b>100</b> is described in detail. It is noted that while the following description of the method <b>600</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is cast in terms of the single port pair connector assembly, the broader method of the invention is equally applicable to other configurations (e.g., the “row-and-column” embodiment of FIG. <b>2</b>).</p>
    <p num="p-0113">In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the method <b>600</b> generally comprises first forming the assembly housing element <b>102</b> in step <b>602</b>. The housing is formed using an injection molding process of the type well known in the art, although other processes may be used. The injection molding process is chosen for its ability to accurately replicate small details of the mold, low cost, and ease of processing.</p>
    <p num="p-0114">Next, two conductor sets are provided in step <b>604</b>. As previously described, the conductor sets comprise metallic (e.g., copper or aluminum alloy) strips having a substantially square or rectangular cross-section and sized to fit within the slots of the connectors in the housing <b>102</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0115">In step <b>606</b>, the conductors are partitioned into sets; a first set <b>120</b> <i>a </i>for use with the connector recess (i.e., within the housing <b>102</b>, and mating with the modular plug terminals), and a second set <b>120</b> <i>b </i>for mating with the PCB or other external device to which the connector assembly is mated. The conductors are formed to the desired shape(s) using a forming die or machine of the type well known in the art. Specifically, for the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the first conductor set <b>120</b> <i>a </i>is deformed so as to produce the juxtaposed, coplanar “90-degree turn” as previously described. The second conductor <b>120</b> <i>b </i>set is deformed to produce the desired juxtaposed, non-coplanar array which is used to mate with the PCB/external device.</p>
    <p num="p-0116">Note also that either or both of the aforementioned conductor sets may also be notched (not shown) at their distal ends such that electrical leads associated with the electronic components (e.g., fine-gauge wire wrapped around the magnetic toroid element) may be wrapped around the distal end notch to provide a secure electrical connection.</p>
    <p num="p-0117">Next, the primary substrate is formed and perforated through its thickness with a number of apertures of predetermined size in step <b>608</b>. Methods for forming substrates are well known in the electronic arts, and accordingly are not described further herein. Any conductive traces on the substrate required by the particular design are also added, such that necessary ones of the conductors, when received within the apertures, are in electrical communication with the traces.</p>
    <p num="p-0118">The apertures within the primary substrate are arranged in two arrays of juxtaposed perforations, one at each end of the substrate, and with spacing (i.e., pitch) such that their position corresponds to the desired pattern, although other arrangements may be used. Any number of different methods of perforating the substrate may be used, including a rotating drill bit, punch, heated probe, or even laser energy. Alternatively, the apertures may be formed at the time of formation of the substrate itself, thereby obviating a separate manufacturing step.</p>
    <p num="p-0119">Next, the secondary substrate formed and is perforated through its thickness with a number of apertures of predetermined size in step <b>610</b>. The apertures are arranged in an array of bi-planar perforations which receive corresponding ones of the second conductors <b>120</b> <i>b </i>therein, the apertures of the second substrate acting to register and add mechanical stability to the second set of conductors. Alternatively, the apertures may be formed at the time of formation of the substrate itself.</p>
    <p num="p-0120">In step <b>612</b>, one or more electronic components, such as the aforementioned toroidal coils and surface mount devices, are next formed and prepared (if used in the design). The manufacture and preparation of such electronic components is well known in the art, and accordingly is not described further herein. The electronic components are then mated to the primary substrate in step <b>613</b>. Note that if no components are used, the conductive traces formed on/within the primary substrate will form the conductive pathway between the first set of conductors and respective ones of the second set of conductors. The components may optionally be (i) received within corresponding apertures designed to receive portions of the component (e.g., for mechanical stability), (ii) bonded to the substrate such as through the use of an adhesive or encapsulant, (iii) mounted in “free space” (i.e., held in place through tension generated on the electrical leads of the component when the latter are terminated to the substrate conductive traces and/or conductor distal ends, or (iv) maintained in position by other means. In one embodiment, the surface mount components are first positioned on the primary substrate, and the magnetics (e.g., toroids) positioned thereafter, although other sequences may be used. The components are electrically coupled to the PCB using a eutectic solder re-flow process as is well known in the art. The assembled primary substrate with electronic components is then optionally secured with a silicon encapsulant (step <b>614</b>), although other materials may be used.</p>
    <p num="p-0121">In step <b>616</b>, the assembled primary substrate with SMT/magnetics is electrically tested to ensure proper operation.</p>
    <p num="p-0122">The first and second sets of conductors are next disposed within respective ones of the apertures in the primary substrate such that two arrays of conductors, each terminated generally to one end of the substrate, are formed (step <b>618</b>). As previously described, the first set of conductors <b>120</b> <i>a </i>forms a co-planar juxtaposed array for mating with the terminals of the modular plug, while the second set of conductors forms a juxtaposed, bi-planar terminal array which is received within, for example, the PCB to which the assembly is ultimately mated. The conductor ends are sunk within the apertures to the desired depth within the primary substrate, and optionally bonded thereto (such as by using eutectic solder bonded to the conductor and surrounding substrate terminal pad, or adhesive) in addition to being frictionally received within their respective apertures, the latter being slightly undersized so as to create the aforementioned frictional relationship. As yet another alternative, the distal ends of the conductors may be tapered such that a progressive frictional fit occurs, the taper adjusted to allow the conductor penetration within the board to the extent (e.g., depth) desired.</p>
    <p num="p-0123">As yet another alternative to the foregoing, the conductors of each set may be “molded” within the primary substrate at the desired location at the time of formation of the latter. This approach has the advantage of obviating subsequent steps of insertion/bonding of the conductors, but also somewhat complicates the substrate manufacturing process.</p>
    <p num="p-0124">The finished insert assembly is then inserted into the housing element <b>102</b> in step <b>620</b>, such that the assembly is received into the cavity <b>134</b>, and the first conductors received into respective ones of the grooves <b>122</b> formed in the assembly housing <b>102</b>.</p>
    <p num="p-0125">Next, in step <b>622</b>, the secondary substrate is mated to the primary substrate such that the second set of conductors protrude through the bi-planar aperture array, the former ultimately being terminated to the target PCB/external device. The secondary substrate may by simply fitted onto the second set of conductors and held in place by friction between the two components, or alternatively physically bonded to the primary substrate and/or second conductors if desired, such as using eutectic solder. Other means of positioning/engagement may also be used, such as attachment of the secondary substrate to the walls of the housing element alone. This step <b>622</b> completes the formation of the connector assembly.</p>
    <p num="p-0126">With respect to the other embodiments described herein (i.e., multi-port “row and column” connector housing, connector assembly with LEDs, etc.), the foregoing method may be modified as necessary to accommodate the additional components. For example, where a multi-port connector is used, a single common secondary substrate may be fabricated, and the second conductors of the respective primary electronic component assemblies inserted into the common secondary substrate to produce a single assembly for the connector as a whole. Such modifications and alterations will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill, given the disclosure provided herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0127">It will be recognized that while certain aspects of the invention are described in terms of a specific sequence of steps of a method, these descriptions are only illustrative of the broader methods of the invention, and may be modified as required by the particular application. Certain steps may be rendered unnecessary or optional under certain circumstances. Additionally, certain steps or functionality may be added to the disclosed embodiments, or the order of performance of two or more steps permuted. All such variations are considered to be encompassed within the invention disclosed and claimed herein.</p>
    <p num="p-0128">While the above detailed description has shown, described, and pointed out novel features of the invention as applied to various embodiments, it will be understood that various omissions, substitutions, and changes in the form and details of the device or process illustrated may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the invention. The foregoing description is of the best mode presently contemplated of carrying out the invention. This description is in no way meant to be limiting, but rather should be taken as illustrative of the general principles of the invention. The scope of the invention should be determined with reference to the claims.</p>
