    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>This invention relates generally to fluorescent dye compounds useful as molecular probes. More specifically, this invention relates to aromatic-substituted xanthene dyes useful as fluorescent labeling reagents.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading> <p>The non-radioactive detection of biological analytes utilizing fluorescent labels is an important technology in modem analytical biotechnology. By eliminating the need for radioactive labels, safety is enhanced and the environmental impact of reagent disposal is greatly reduced. Examples of methods utilizing such fluorescent detection methods include DNA sequencing, oligonucleotide probe methods, detection of polymerase-chain-reaction products, immunoassays, and the like.</p>
    <p>In many important applications the independent detection of multiple spatially overlapping analytes in a mixture is required, e.g., single-tube multiplex DNA probe assays, immuno assays, multicolor DNA sequencing methods, and the like. In the case of multi-loci DNA probe assays, by employing spectrally distinguishable fluorescent labels, the number of reaction tubes may be reduced thereby simplifying experimental protocols and facilitating the manufacturing of application-specific kits. In the case of automated DNA sequencing, multicolor fluorescent labeling allows for the analysis of multiple bases in a single lane thereby increasing throughput over single-color methods and reducing uncertainties associated with inter-lane electrophoretic mobility variations.</p>
    <p>Multi-color fluorescent detection imposes five severe constraints on the selection of dye labels, particularly for applications requiring a single excitation light source, an electrophoretic separation, and/or treatment with enzymes, e.g., automated fluorescence-based DNA sequencing. First, it is difficult to find a set of dyes whose emission spectra are spectrally resolved, since the typical emission band half-width for organic fluorescent dyes is about 40-80 nanometers (nm) and the width of available spectrum is limited by the excitation light source. Second, even if dyes with non-overlapping emission spectra are found, the set may still not be suitable if the respective fluorescent efficiencies are too low. Third, when several fluorescent dyes are used concurrently, simultaneous excitation becomes difficult because the absorption bands of the dyes are widely separated. Fourth, the charge, molecular size, and conformation of the dyes must not adversely affect the electrophoretic mobilities of the analyte. Fifth, the fluorescent dyes must be compatible with the chemistry used to create or manipulate the analyte, e.g., DNA synthesis solvents and reagents, buffers, polymerase enzymes, ligase enzymes, and the like.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY</heading> <p>The present invention relates to the discovery of a class of aromatic-substituted xanthene dye compounds suitable for the creation of sets of spectrally-resolvable fluorescent labels useful for multi-color fluorescent detection. The invention achieves one or more of the following objects depending upon the particular aspect and embodiment employed.</p>
    <p>It is an object of the invention to provide a class of aromatic-substituted xanthene dye compounds having red-shifted emission spectra, e.g., emission maxima at a wavelength greater than about 540 nm.</p>
    <p>It is a further object of the invention to provide a class of aromatic-substituted xanthene dye compounds suitable for applications requiring multi-color fluorescent detection using a single excitation light source, an electrophoretic separation, and/or treatment with enzymes, e.g., automated fluorescence-based DNA sequencing.</p>
    <p>It is another object of the present invention to provide a class of aromatic-substituted xanthene dye compounds wherein the emission spectra of the dyes can be modulated by minor variations in the type of aromatic substituents employed.</p>
    <p>It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a class of aromatic-substituted xanthene dye compounds which are substantially brighter than non-aromatic-substituted xanthene dyes.</p>
    <p>In a first aspect, the foregoing and other objects of the invention are achieved by an aromatic-substituted xanthene dye compound having the formula ##STR1## wherein the composition of the variable substituents is as follows. Y<sub>1</sub> and Y<sub>2</sub> taken separately are selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, oxygen, imminium, linking group and amine, or Y<sub>1</sub> taken together with R<sub>2</sub> is cyclic amine, or Y<sub>2</sub> taken together with R<sub>3</sub> is cyclic imine. R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>, R<sub>5</sub>, and R<sub>7</sub> taken separately are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, lower alkyl, lower alkene, lower alkyne, sulfonate, sulfone, amino, imminium, amido, nitrile, lower alkoxy, phenyl, and linking group. R<sub>1</sub> taken separately is selected from the group consisting of phenyl, substituted phenyl, polycyclic aromatic, substituted polycyclic aromatic, linking group and electron-rich heterocycle, or when taken together with R<sub>7</sub> is selected from the group consisting of electron-rich heterocycle and indene. R<sub>4</sub> taken separately is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, lower alkyl, lower alkene, lower alkyne, sulfonate, sulfone, amino, imminium, amido, nitrile, lower alkoxy, phenyl, linking group, phenyl, substituted phenyl, polycyclic aromatic, substituted polycyclic aromatic, indene, and electron-rich heterocycle, or when taken together with R<sub>5</sub> is selected from the group consisting of phenyl, substituted phenyl, polycyclic aromatic, substituted polycyclic aromatic, indene, and electron-rich heterocycle. In the above structure, at least one of R<sub>4</sub> and R<sub>1</sub> is not linking group. R<sub>6</sub> is selected from the group consisting of acetylene, lower alkyl, lower alkene, cyano, phenyl, heterocyclic aromatic, and substituted phenyl having the structure ##STR2## wherein X<sub>1</sub> -X<sub>5</sub> taken separately are hydrogen, chlorine, fluorine, lower alkyl, carboxylic acid, sulfonic acid, --CH<sub>2</sub> OH, or linking group.</p>
    <p>In a second aspect, the invention includes an energy transfer dye comprising a donor dye, and acceptor dye and a linker linking the donor and acceptor dyes. The donor dye is capable of absorbing light at a first wavelength and emitting excitation energy in response, and the acceptor dye is capable of absorbing the excitation energy emitted by the donor dye and fluorescing at a second wavelength in response. The linker serves to facilitate the efficient transfer of energy between the donor dye and the acceptor dye. According to the invention, at least one of the donor dye and acceptor dye is an aromatic-substituted xanthene dye having the structure set forth above.</p>
    <p>In a third aspect, the present invention includes a labeled nucleoside/tide having the structure</p>
    <p>

B<sub>1</sub> is a phosphite ester protecting group; B<sub>2</sub>, and B<sub>3</sub> taken separately are selected from the group consisting of lower alkyl, lower alkene, aryl, and cycloalkyl containing up to 10 carbon atoms; B<sub>5</sub> is an acid-cleavable hydroxyl protecting group; B is a nucleoside/tide base, and D is a dye compound having the structure set forth above. According to the invention, when B is purine or 7-deazapurine, the sugar moiety is attached at the N<sup>9</sup> -position of the purine or 7-deazapurine, and when B is pyrimidine, the sugar moiety is attached at the N<sup>1</sup> -position of the pyrimidine. B and D are linked through a linkage attached to D at one of positions R<sub>1</sub> -R<sub>6</sub>. If B is a purine, the linkage is attached to the 8-position of the purine, if B is 7-deazapurine, the linkage is attached to the 7-position of the 7-deazapurine, and if B is pyrimidine, the linkage is attached to the 5-position of the pyrimidine.</p>
    <p>In a sixth aspect, the invention includes a method of fragment analysis comprising forming labeled polynucleotide fragments labeled with an aromatic-substituted xanthene dye having the structure set forth above, subjecting the labeled polynucleotide fragments to a size-dependent separation process, e.g., electrophoresis, and detecting the labeled polynucleotide fragments subsequent to the separation process.</p>

    <p>II. Aromatic-substituted Xanthene Dye Compounds</p>
    <p>A. Structure</p>
    <p>In a first aspect, the present invention comprises a novel class of aromatic-substituted xanthene dye compounds having the general structure shown in Formula I immediately below. (Note that any molecular structures provided herein are intended to encompass not only the exact electronic structure presented, but also include all resonant structures and protonation states thereof.) ##STR6##</p>
    <p>Referring to Formula I, Y<sub>1</sub> and Y<sub>2</sub> are either individually hydroxyl, oxygen, amine, imminium or linking group. When Y<sub>1</sub> is hydroxyl and Y<sub>2</sub> is oxygen, the compound is analogous to fluorescein, while when Y<sub>1</sub> is amine and Y<sub>2</sub> is imminium, the compound is analogous to rhodamine. Preferably Y<sub>1</sub> is hydroxyl and Y<sub>2</sub> is oxygen.</p>
    <p>Moieties R<sub>1</sub> -R<sub>6</sub> are substituents used to modulate various properties of the dyes by modifying the electronic structure of the ground and excited states of the molecule. In particular, varying moieties R<sub>1</sub> -R<sub>6</sub> affects the spectral characteristics, chemical stability, and photostability of the compounds. For example, it has been observed that if R<sub>6</sub> is substituted phenyl, making particular substituents X<sub>2</sub> and X<sub>5</sub> chlorine leads to narrower emission bands. (See below for the definition of substituents X<sub>2</sub> and X<sub>5</sub>.) Particularly important substituents in the context of the present invention are R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>4</sub>, R<sub>5</sub>, and R<sub>7</sub>, especially R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>4</sub>, where such substituents are aromatic or substituted aromatic groups.</p>
    <p>Preferably, substituents R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>, R<sub>5</sub> and R<sub>7</sub> are hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, lower alkyl, lower alkene, lower alkyne, sulfonate, sulfone, amino, immininium, amido, nitrile, aryl, lower alkoxy, or linking group. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, R<sub>2</sub> and/or R<sub>3</sub> are hydrogen, chlorine or fluorine.</p>
    <p>The nature of substituents R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>4</sub>, R<sub>5</sub> and R<sub>7</sub> is particularly important to the present invention as it is these substituent positions at which the most relevant aromatic substitutions are made. In particular, substituent R<sub>1</sub> taken separately may be phenyl, substituted phenyl, polycyclic aromatic, substituted polycyclic aromatic, and electron-rich heterocycle. Alternatively, when taken together with R<sub>7</sub>, the R<sub>1</sub> /R<sub>7</sub> combination may be electron-rich heterocycle or indene. Substituent R<sub>4</sub> taken separately is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, lower alkyl, lower alkene, lower alkyne, sulfonate, sulfone, amino, imminium, amido, nitrile, lower alkoxy, phenyl, linking group, amine, phenyl, substituted phenyl, polycyclic aromatic, substituted polycyclic aromatic, indene, and electron-rich heterocycle, or when taken together with R<sub>5</sub> is selected from the group consisting of phenyl, substituted phenyl, polycyclic aromatic, substituted polycyclic aromatic, indene, and electron-rich heterocycle;</p>
    <p>Substituent R<sub>6</sub> may be acetylene, lower alkyl, lower alkene, cyano, phenyl, heterocyclic aromatic, or substituted phenyl having the structure: ##STR7## wherein X<sub>1</sub> -X<sub>5</sub> taken separately are hydrogen, chlorine, fluorine, lower alkyl, carboxylic acid, sulfonic acid, --CH<sub>2</sub> OH, or linking group.</p>
    <p>In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention in which the mission spectra of the dye is substantially narrower than otherwise substituted dyes, R<sub>6</sub> is substituted phenyl, e.g., Menchen et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,188,934. Preferably, the substituted phenyl is substituted such that X<sub>1</sub> is carboxylic acid, sulfonic acid, or --CH<sub>2</sub> OH; X<sub>2</sub> and X<sub>5</sub> taken separately are hydrogen, chlorine, fluorine, or lower alkyl; and X<sub>3</sub> and X<sub>4</sub> taken separately are hydrogen, chlorine, fluorine, lower alkyl, carboxylic acid, sulfonic acid, or linking group. More preferably, X<sub>2</sub> and X<sub>5</sub> are chlorine. In an additional preferred embodiment, one of X<sub>3</sub> or X<sub>4</sub> is linking group. Preferably, X, is carboxylic acid. In an additional preferred embodiment particularly suited to forming phosphoramidite compounds including the dye compounds of the invention, one of X<sub>1</sub> or X<sub>5</sub> is a moiety which is capable of forming a cyclic ester or cyclic ether, e.g., carboxylic acid, sulfonic acid, --CH<sub>2</sub> OH, or any other group that will form a spirocyclic system, i.e., bicyclic compounds having one carbon atom common to both rings, e.g., spiro[4.5]decane.</p>
    <p>Several exemplary aromatic-substituted xanthene dye structures are shown in FIG. 1. In compound 26, R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>4</sub> are phenyl; in compound 28, R<sub>1</sub> taken together with R<sub>7</sub> is an electron-rich heterocycle, and R<sub>4</sub> taken together with R<sub>5</sub> is an electron-rich heterocycle, more specifically both combinations are benzofuran having 2 and 3 positions fused to the xanthene ring; in compound 29, R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>4</sub> taken separately are each polycyclic aromatic, more specifically naphthalene; in compound 25 R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>4</sub> taken separately are each naphthalene and R<sub>2</sub> and R<sub>3</sub> taken separately are fluorine; and in compound 35, R<sub>1</sub> taken together with R<sub>7</sub> is benzofuran having 2 and 3 positions fused to the xanthene ring, R<sub>3</sub> is fluorine, and R<sub>4</sub> taken together with R<sub>5</sub> is phenyl.</p>
    <p>B. Synthetic Methods</p>
    <p>Generally, the aromatic-substituted xanthene dyes of the invention are prepared as follows. See FIGS. 2A-B.</p>
    <p>First, one or more functionalized phenol intermediates are prepared by metallating a halogenated phenyl precursor 1, e.g., with an alkyl lithium salt, to form a metallized intermediate 2. The metalated intermediate is then reacted with trimethyl borate followed by hydrolysis to yield the boronic acid 3. The boronic acid 3 then undergos a palladium-catalyzed coupling with bromophenol methyl ether 4 to yield a methylated substituted phenol ether that is subsequently demethylated with boron tribromide to yield the substituted phenol 5. Alternatively, compound 4 may be metallated and converted to its boronic acid, followed by a palladium catalyzed coupling with 1 to ultimately yield 5. The bromide intermediates may also be converted to other intermediates that react with bromides or iodides with palladium catalysis, such as replacing the boronic acid with alkyl tin derivatives.</p>
    <p>Unsymmetrical dyes are most readily prepared by first performing a condensation of a first functionalized phenol intermediate 5 with reagent 6 that contains an activated acid such as an acid chloride. The condensation can be performed using a Friedel-Crafts catalyst, such as aluminum chloride, and yields the aromatic ketone 7. Aromatic ketone 7 is then condensed with a second functionalized phenol 8 at elevated temperature, e.g., above 80° C., in the presence of a strong acid, e.g., sulfuric acid, to yield the unsymmetrical aromatic-substituted xanthene dye 9.</p>
    <p>Symmetrical aromatic-substituted xanthene dyes are most easily prepared by condensing two equivalents of a substituted phenol intermediate 5 with one equivalent of a reagent 6 that contains an activated acid, e.g., an acid chloride or anhydride, at elevated temperature, e.g., above 80° C., in the presence of a strong acid, e.g., sulfuric acid.</p>
    <p>II. Energy Transfer Dyes Incorporating Dye Compounds</p>
    <p>In another aspect, the present invention comprises energy transfer dye compounds incorporating the aromatic-substituted xanthene dye compounds of Formula I. Generally, the energy transfer dyes of the present invention include a donor dye which absorbs light at a first wavelength and emits excitation energy in response, an acceptor dye which is capable of absorbing the excitation energy emitted by the donor dye and fluorescing at a second wavelength in response, and a linker which attaches the donor dye to the acceptor dye, the linker being effective to facilitate efficient energy transfer between the donor and acceptor dyes. A through discussion of the structure, synthesis and use of such energy transfer dyes is provided by Lee et al., U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/726,462, and Mathies et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,654,419.</p>
    <p>One linker according to the present invention for linking a donor dye to an acceptor dye in an energy transfer fluorescent dye has the general structure ##STR8## where R<sub>2</sub>, is a lower alkyl attached to the donor dye, Z<sub>1</sub> is either NH, sulfur or oxygen, R<sub>22</sub> is a substituent which includes an alkene, diene, alkyne, a five and six membered ring having at least one unsaturated bond or a fused ring structure which is attached to the carbonyl carbon, and R<sub>28</sub> includes a functional group which attaches the linker to the acceptor dye.</p>
    <p>In one embodiment of this linker, illustrated below, the linker has the general structure ##STR9## where R<sub>21</sub> and R<sub>22</sub> are as detailed above, Z<sub>1</sub> and Z<sub>2</sub> are each independently either NH, sulfur or oxygen, R<sub>29</sub> is a lower alkyl, and the terminal carbonyl group is attached to a ring structure of the acceptor dye. In the variation where Z<sub>2</sub> is nitrogen, the C(O)R<sub>22</sub> R<sub>29</sub> Z<sub>2</sub> subunit forms an amino acid subunit. Particular examples of five or six membered rings which may be used as R<sub>22</sub> in the linker include, but are not limited to cyclopentene, cyclohexene, cyclopentadiene, cyclohexadiene, furan, thiofuran, pyrrole, isopyrole, isoazole, pyrazole, isoimidazole, pyran, pyrone, benzene, pyridine, pyridazine, pyrimidine, pyrazine and oxazine. Examples of fused ring structures include, but are not limited to indene, benzofuran, thionaphthene, indole and naphthalene. A preferred embodiment of this linker is where R<sub>21</sub> and R<sub>29</sub> are methylene, Z<sub>1</sub> and Z<sub>2</sub> are NH, and R<sub>22</sub> is benzene, as shown below. ##STR10##</p>
    <p>In another preferred embodiment of the energy-transfer-dye aspect of the present invention, the linker attaches to the aromatic-substituted xanthene dye component of the energy transfer dye at the R<sub>3</sub> substituent position. In an alternative preferred embodiment, R<sub>6</sub> of the aromatic-substituted xanthene dye component of the energy transfer dye is substituted phenyl and the linker attaches to the aromatic-substituted xanthene dye at one of the X<sub>3</sub> or X<sub>4</sub> substituent positions.</p>
    <p>In yet another preferred embodiment of the energy-transfer-dye aspect of the present invention, the first member the dye pair is aromatic-substituted xanthene, and the second member of the dye pair is cyanine, phthalocyanine, squaraine, or aromatic-substituted xanthene having different substitutions than the first member.</p>
    <p>III. Reagents Incorporating Dye Compounds</p>
    <p>In another aspect, the present invention comprises reagents labeled with the aromatic-substituted xanthene dye compounds of Formula I. Reagents of the invention can be virtually anything to which the dyes of the invention can be attached. Preferably, the dyes are covalently attached to the reagent. Reagents may include but are not limited to proteins, polypeptides, polysaccharides, nucleotides, nucleosides, polynucleotides, lipids, solid supports, organic and inorganic polymers, and combinations and assemblages thereof, such as chromosomes, nuclei, living cells, such as bacteria or other microorganisms, mammalian cells, tissues, and the like.</p>
    <p>A. Nucleoside/tide Reagents</p>
    <p>A preferred class of labeled reagents comprise nucleoside/tides that incorporate the aromatic-substituted xanthene dyes of the invention. Such nucleoside/tide reagents are particularly useful in the context of labeling polynucleotides formed by enzymatic synthesis, e.g., nucleotide triphosphates used in the context of PCR amplification, Sanger-type polynucleotide sequencing, and nick-translation reactions.</p>
    <p>Generally, the structure of the labeled nucleoside/tide reagent is</p>
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation">NUC-DYE</pre>
    
    <heading>FORMULA II</heading> <p>where NUC is a nucleoside/tide or nucleoside/tide analog and DYE is an aromatic-substituted dye compound of Formula I.</p>
    <p>The linkage linking the nucleoside/tide and the dye may be attached to the dye at any one of positions R<sub>1</sub> -R<sub>7</sub>. Preferably, the dye and nucleotide are attached through the R<sub>6</sub> position of the dye. When the dyes of the invention are synthesized from trimelletic anhydride, R<sub>6</sub> is preferably substituted phenyl and the linkage is attached to the dye at one of the X<sub>3</sub> or X<sub>4</sub> positions of the substituted phenyl, the other position being a hydrogen atom.</p>
    <p>When NUC includes a purine base, the linkage between NUC and DYE is attached to the N<sup>8</sup> -position of the purine, when NUC includes a 7-deazapurine base, the linkage is attached to the N<sup>7</sup> -position of the 7-deazapurine, and when NUC includes a pyrimidine base, the linkage is attached to the N<sup>5</sup> -position of the pyrimidine.</p>
    <p>Nucleoside labeling can be accomplished using any one of a large number of known nucleoside/tide labeling techniques employing known linkages, linking groups, and associated complementary functionalities. Generally, the linkage linking the dye and nucleoside should (i) be stable to oligonucleotide synthesis conditions, (ii) not interfere with oligonucleotide-target hybridization, (iii) be compatible with relevant enzymes, e.g., polymerases, ligases, and the like, and (iv) not adversely affect the fluorescence properties of the dye. Exemplary base labeling procedures suitable for use in connection with the present invention include the following: Gibson et al, Nucleic Acids Research, 15:6455-6467 (1987); Gebeyehu et al, Nucleic Acids Research, 15: 4513-4535 (1987); Haralambidis et al, Nucleic Acids Research, 15: 4856-4876 (1987); Nelson et al., Nucleosides and Nucleotides, 5(3): 233-241 (1986); Bergstrom, et al., JACS, 111: 374-375 (1989); U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,855,225, 5,231,191, and 5,449,767.</p>
    <p>Preferably, the linkages are acetylenic amido or alkenic amido linkages, the linkage between the dye and the nucleoside/tide base being formed by reacting an activated N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester of the dye with an alkynylamino- or alkenylamino-derivatized base of a nucleoside/tide. More preferably, the resulting linkage is 3-(carboxy)amino-1-propyn-1-yl having the structure ##STR11## Alternative preferred linkages include substituted propargylethoxyamido linkages having the structure</p>
    <p>
      </p> <pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation">--C.tbd.C--CH<sub>2</sub> OCH<sub>2</sub> CH<sub>2</sub> NR<sub>3</sub> X--</pre>
    
    <p>wherein X is selected from the group consisting of ##STR12## where n ranges from 1 to 5, ##STR13## where n ranges from 1 to 5, ##STR14## R<sub>1</sub> is selected from the group consisting of --H, lower alkyl and protecting group; and R<sub>3</sub> is selected from the group consisting of --H and lower alkyl. See Khan et al., U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/833,854 filed Apr. 10, 1997.</p>
    <p>The synthesis of alkynylamino-derivatized nucleosides is taught by Hobbs et al. in European Patent Application No. 87305844.0, and Hobbs et al., J Org Chem., 54: 3420 (1989). Briefly, the alkynylamino-derivatized nucleotides are formed by placing the appropriate halodideoxynucleoside (usually 5-iodopyrimidine and 7-iodo-7-deazapurine dideoxynucleosides as taught by Hobbs et al. (cited above)) and Cu(I) in a flask, flushing with argon to remove air, adding dry DMF, followed by addition of an alkynylamine, triethyl-amine and Pd(0). The reaction mixture is stirred for several hours, or until thin layer chromatography indicates consumption of the halodideoxynucleoside. When an unprotected alkynylamine is used, the alkynylamino-nucleoside can be isolated by concentrating the reaction mixture and chromatographing on silica gel using an eluting solvent which contains ammonium hydroxide to neutralize the hydrohalide generated in the coupling reaction. When a protected alkynylamine is used, methanol/methylene chloride can be added to the reaction mixture, followed by the bicarbonate form of a strongly basic anion exchange resin. The slurry can then be stirred for about 45 minutes, filtered, and the resin rinsed with additional methanol/methylene chloride. The combined filtrates can be concentrated and purified by flash-chromatography on silica gel using a methanol-methylene chloride gradient. The triphosphates are obtained by standard techniques.</p>

In a second particularly preferred embodiment, the nucleotides of the present invention are deoxynucleotide triphosphates having the structure shown in Formula IV.2 below, including associated counterions if present. ##STR17## Labeled deoxynucleotides such as that shown in Formula IV.2 find particular application as means for labeling polymerase extension products, e.g., in the polymerase chain reaction or nick-translation.</p>
    <p>C. Phosphoramidite Reagents</p>
    <p>Another preferred class of reagents comprise phosphoramidite compounds which incorporate the aromatic-substituted xanthene dyes of the invention. Such phosphoramidite reagents are particularly useful for the automated chemical synthesis of polynucleotides labeled with the aromatic-substituted xanthene dyes of the invention. Such phosphoramidite compounds when reacted with a 5'-hydroxyl group of a nucleotide or polynucleotide form a phosphite ester linkage which, in turn, is oxidized to give a phosphate ester linkage, e.g., Caruthers et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,458,066 and 4,415,732.</p>
    <p>1. Non-nucleotide Phosphoramidite Reagents: Generally, in one aspect, the phosphoramidite reagents of the invention have the structure of Formula V immediately below, ##STR18## where X is a spacer arm; D is an aromatic-substituted xanthene dye of Formula I or a protected derivative thereof; Y is a linkage formed with a linking group on the dye; B<sub>1</sub> is a phosphite ester protecting group, and B<sub>2</sub> and B<sub>3</sub> taken separately are lower alkyl, lower alkene, lower aryl having between 1 and 8 carbon atoms, aralkyl, or cycloalkyl containing up to 10 carbon atoms. Spacer X and linkage Y may take a variety of forms, however, the structure X-Y must be such that (i) it is stable to DNA synthesis conditions, (ii) does not substantially interfere with oligonucleotide-target hybridization, and (iii) does not quench the fluorescence of the dye to which it is attached, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,231,191, 5,258,538, and 4,757,141 and 5,212,304.</p>
    <p>Preferably X is linear or cyclic lower alkyl, linear or cyclic substituted lower alkyl, polyethlene oxide, lower aryl having between 1 and 8 carbon atoms, peptide, or polyether. Preferably the linkage Y is amido, sulfonamido, urea, urethane, or thourea. In one particularly preferred embodiment, the linkage Y is amido and the spacer X is linear alkyl having the structure shown below in Formula V.1 ##STR19## where n ranges from 2 to 30, preferably from 2 to 10, and more preferably from 2 to 6. In a second particularly preferred embodiment, the linkage Y is amido and the spacer X is linear polyethylene oxide having the structure shown below in Formula V.2 ##STR20## where n is from 2 to 30, preferably from 2 to 10, and more preferably from 2 to 6.</p>
    <p>Preferably, B<sub>2</sub> and B<sub>3</sub> taken together form an alkyl chain containing up to 5 carbon atoms in the principle chain and a total of up to 10 carbon atoms with both terminal valence bonds of said chains being attached to the nitrogen atom. Alternatively, B<sub>2</sub> and B<sub>3</sub> taken together with the nitrogen atom form a saturated nitrogen heterocycle which contains one or more heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. Preferably, B<sub>2</sub> and B<sub>3</sub> taken separately are isopropyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, or sec-butyl, and B<sub>2</sub> and B<sub>3</sub> taken together is morphollino.</p>
    <p>B<sub>1</sub> is a phosphite ester protecting group which prevents unwanted extension of the polynucleotide to which the phosphoramidite is attached. B<sub>1</sub> is stable to polynucleotide synthesis conditions yet is able to be removed from the polynucleotide product with a reagent that does not adversely affect the integrity of the polynucleotide or the dye. Preferably, B<sub>1</sub> is methyl, β-cyanoethyl, or 4-nitrophenylethyl.</p>
    <p>The linkage linking Y and D is attached to D at one of positions R<sub>1</sub> -R<sub>7</sub>. When the dyes of the invention are synthesized from trimelletic anhydride, R<sub>6</sub> is preferably substituted phenyl and the linkage is attached to the dye at one of the X<sub>3</sub> or X<sub>4</sub> positions of the substituted phenyl.</p>
    <p>Such phosphoramidite compounds may be synthesized by a variety of known methods. Generally, the synthesis proceeds as follows. Phenolic hydroxyls of the dye are protected with dye-protecting groups that can be removed with a DNA synthesis deprotection agent, e.g., ammonia, ethanolamine, methylamine/ammonium hydroxide mixtures, and mixtures of t-butylamine/water/methanol (1:2:1), e.g., see U.S. Pat. No. 5,231,191. Dyes so protected are referred to herein as "protected derivatives" of the dye. Preferred protecting groups include esters of benzoic acid or pivalic acid. The linking group of the protected dye, e.g., carboxylic acid, is then activated, e.g., with carbodiimide, and reacted with an alcohol linker derivative, e.g., an amino alcohol, e.g., ethanolamine, hexanol amine, or the like, in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), or another like aprotic solvent to yield a protected dye with a free alcohol functionality, e.g., alcohol-amide derivative. The free alcohol is then reacted with a phosphitylating agent using standard procedures, e.g., di-(N,N-diisopropylamino)methoxyphosphine in acetonitrile containing catalytic amounts of tetrazole diisopropylamine, to yield the phosphoramidite, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,231,191.</p>
    <p>Non-nucleotidic phosphoramidites as shown in Formula V are particularly well suited for labeling the 5'-end of a chemically-synthesized polynucleotide through the sugar-portion of the nucleotide.</p>
    <p>2. Nucleotidic Phosphoramidite Reagents: In a second preferred embodiment, the phosphoramidite reagents of the invention have the structure of Formula VI immediately below, ##STR21## where B<sub>1</sub> -B<sub>3</sub> are as described above, B<sub>5</sub> is hydrogen or a hydroxyl protecting group, B is a nucleotide base, and D is an aromatic-substituted xanthene dye of Formula I, or a protected derivative thereof.</p>
    <p>When B is purine or 7-deazapurine, the sugar moiety is attached at the N<sup>9</sup> -position of the purine or deazapurine. Alternatively, when B is pyrimidine, the sugar moiety is attached at the N<sup>1</sup> -position of the pyrimidine. B and D are linked through a linkage formed by the reaction of a linking group and its complementary functionality as described in detail above. If B is purine, the linkage is attached to the 8-position of the purine, while if B is 7-deazapurine, the linkage is attached to the 7-position of the 7-deazapurine. If B is pyrimidine, the linkage is attached to the 5-position of the pyrimidine.</p>
    <p>B<sub>5</sub> refers generally to hydrogen or an acid-cleavable hydroxyl protecting group. Preferably, B<sub>5</sub> is triphenylmethyl radical and its electron-donating-substituted derivatives, where, as used herein, the term "electron-donating" denotes the tendency of a substituent to release valence electrons to neighboring atoms in the molecule of which it is a part, i.e., it is electropositive with respect to neighboring atoms. Preferably, electron-donating substituents include amino, lower alkyl, lower aryl having between 1 and 8 carbon atoms, lower alkoxy, and the like. More preferably, the electron-donating substituents are methoxy. Exemplary trityls include 4,4'-dimethoxytrityl, i.e. bis(p-anisyl)phenylmethyl, monomethoxytrityl, α-naphthyldiphenylmethyl, tri(p-methoxyphenyl)methyl, and the like. Attachment and cleavage conditions for these and other trityls can be found in Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd Edition (John Wiley, New York, 1991).</p>
    <p>Generally, the nucleotide phosphoramidites of the invention may be synthesized as follows. A nucleoside bearing a hydroxyl protecting group on the 5'-hydroxyl and a protected complementary functionality on the base is selectively deprotected to expose only the complementary functionality. Next, a protected dye (as described above) is activated by converting a linking group into its reactive form. The activated linking group of the dye is then reacted with the complementary functionality of the nucleoside to form the dye labeled nucleoside that bears protecting groups on the 5'-hydroxyl (and on the 2'-hydroxyl for the case of RNA) and on the phenolic groups of the dye. The dye labeled nucleoside is then reacted with a phosphitylating agent as described above to produce the nucleotide phosphoramidite.</p>
    <p>In a preferred method where the complementary functionality is amine and the linking group is carboxyl, the synthesis proceeds as follows. A protected nucleoside bearing a hydroxyl protecting group on the 5'-hydroxl, e.g., a trityl group, and a protected amino-nitrogen complementary functionality on the base, is selectively deprotected to expose the amine, such selective deprotection serving to deprotect only the amine functionality without deprotecting the protected 5'-hydroxyl moiety. A protected dye (as described above) is activated by converting a carboxy linking group into its NHS ester with dicyclohexyl carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide. The NHS ester is reacted with the amino group of the nucleoside to form the dye labeled nucleoside that bears protecting groups on the 5'-hydroxyl (and on the 2'-hydroxyl for the case of RNA) and on the phenolic groups of the dye. The dye labeled nucleoside is then reacted with a phosphitylating agent as described above.</p>
    <p>Labeled nucleotide phosphoramidites such as shown in Formula VI are particularly well suited for the internal labeling of chemically-synthesized polynucleotides.</p>
    <p>D. Polynucleotide Reagents</p>
    <p>Yet another preferred class of reagents of the present invention comprise polynucleotides labeled with the aromatic-substituted xanthene dyes of the invention. Such labeled polynucleotides are useful in a number of important contexts including as DNA sequencing primers, PCR primers, oligonucleotide hybridization probes, oligonucleotide ligation probes, and the like.</p>
    <p>In one preferred embodiment, the labeled polynucleotides of the present invention include multiple dyes located such that fluorescence energy transfer takes place between a donor dye and an acceptor dye. Such multi-dye energy-transfer polynucleotides find application as spectrally-tunable sequencing primers, e.g., Ju et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92: 4347-4351 (1995), and as hybridization probes, e.g., Lee et al. Nucleic Acids Research, 21: 3761-3766 (1993).</p>
    <p>Labeled polynucleotides may be synthesized either enzymatically, e.g., using a DNA polymerase or ligase, e.g., Stryer, Biochemistry, Chapter 24, W.H. Freeman and Company (1981), or by chemical synthesis, e.g., by the phosphoramidite method, the phosphite-triester method, and the like, e.g., Gait, Oligonucleotide Synthesis, IRL Press (1990). Labels may be introduced during enzymatic synthesis utilizing labeled nucleotide triphosphate monomers as described above, or introduced during chemical synthesis using labeled non-nucleotide or nucleotide phosphoramidites as described above, or may be introduced subsequent to synthesis.</p>
    <p>Generally, if the labeled polynucleotide is made using enzymatic synthesis, the following procedure may be used. A template DNA is denatured and an oligonucleotide primer is annealed to the template DNA. A mixture of deoxynucleotide triphosphates is added to the mixture including dGTP, dATP, dCTP, and dTTP where at least a fraction of the deoxynucleotides is labeled with a dye compound of the invention as described above. Next, a polymerase enzyme is added under conditions where the polymerase enzyme is active. A labeled polynucleotide is formed by the incorporation of the labeled deoxynucleotides during polymerase-mediated strand synthesis. In an alternative enzymatic synthesis method, two primers are used instead of one, one primer complementary to the + strand and the other complementary to the - strand of the target, the polymerase is a thermostable polymerase, and the reaction temperature is cycled between a denaturation temperature and an extension temperature, thereby exponentially synthesizing a labeled complement to the target sequence by PCR, e.g., PCR Protocols, Innis et al. eds., Academic Press (1990).</p>
    <p>Labeled polynucleotides may be chemically synthesized using the phosphoramidite method. Detailed descriptions of the chemistry used to form polynucleotides by the phosphoramidite method are provided elsewhere, e.g., Caruthers et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,458,066 and 4,415,732; Caruthers et al., Genetic Engineering, 4: 1-17 (1982); Users Manual Model 392 and 394 Polynucleotide Synthesizers, pages 6-1 through 6-22, Applied Biosystems, Part No. 901237 (1991).</p>
    <p>The phosphoramidite method of polynucleotide synthesis is the preferred method because of its efficient and rapid coupling and the stability of the starting materials. The synthesis is performed with the growing polynucleotide chain attached to a solid support, so that excess reagents, which are in the liquid phase, can be easily removed by filtration, thereby eliminating the need for purification steps between synthesis cycles.</p>
    <p>The following briefly describes the steps of a typical polynucleotide synthesis cycle using the phosphoramidite method. First, a solid support including a protected nucleotide monomer is treated with acid, e.g., trichloroacetic acid, to remove a 5'-hydroxyl protecting group, freeing the hydroxyl for a subsequent coupling reaction. An activated intermediate is then formed by simultaneously adding a protected phosphoramidite nucleoside monomer and a weak acid, e.g., tetrazole, to the reaction. The weak acid protonates the nitrogen of the phosphoramidite forming a reactive intermediate. Nucleoside addition is complete within 30 s. Next, a capping step is performed which terminates any polynucleotide chains that did not undergo nucleoside addition. Capping is preferably done with acetic anhydride and 1-methylimidazole. The internucleotide linkage is then converted from the phosphite to the more stable phosphotriester by oxidation using iodine as the preferred oxidizing agent and water as the oxygen donor. After oxidation, the hydroxyl protecting group is removed with a protic acid, e.g., trichloroacetic acid or dichloroacetic acid, and the cycle is repeated until chain elongation is complete. After synthesis, the polynucleotide chain is cleaved from the support using a base, e.g., ammonium hydroxide or t-butyl amine. The cleavage reaction also removes any phosphate protecting groups, e.g., cyanoethyl. Finally, the protecting groups on the exocyclic amines of the bases and the hydroxyl protecting groups on the dyes are removed by treating the polynucleotide solution in base at an elevated temperature, e.g., 55° C.</p>
    <p>Any of the phosphoramidite nucleoside monomers may be dye-labeled phosphoramidites as described above. If the 5'-terminal position of the nucleotide is labeled, a labeled non-nucleotidic phosphoramidite of the invention may be used during the final condensation step. If an internal position of the oligonucleotide is labeled, a labeled nucleotidic phosphoramidite of the invention may be used during any of the condensation steps.</p>
    <p>Subsequent to synthesis, the polynucleotide may be labeled at a number of positions including the 5'-terminus, e.g., Oligonucleotides and Analogs, Eckstein ed., Chapter 8, IRL Press (1991) and Orgel et al., Nucleic Acids Research 11(18): 6513 (1983); U.S. Pat. No. 5,118,800; the phosphodiester backbone, e.g., ibid., Chapter 9; or at the 3'-terminus, e.g., Nelson, Nucleic Acids Research 20(23): 6253-6259, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,401,837 and 5,141,813. For a through review of oligonucleotide labeling procedures see R. Haugland in Excited States of Biopolymers, Steiner ed., Plenum Press, NY (1983).</p>
    <p>In one preferred post-synthesis chemical labeling method an oligonuleotide is labeled as follows. A dye including a carboxy linking group is converted to the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester by reacting with approximately 1 equivalent of 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and approximately 3 equivalents of N-hydroxysuccinimide in dry ethyl acetate for 3 hours at room temperature. The reaction mixture is washed with 5% HCl, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to a solid which is resuspended in DMSO. The DMSO dye stock is then added in excess (10-20×) to an aminohexyl derivatized oligonucleotide in 0.25 M bicarbonate/carbonate buffer at pH 9.4 and allowed to react for 6 hours, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,757,141. The dye labeled oligonucleotide is separated from unreacted dye by passage through a size-exclusion chromatography column eluting with buffer, e.g., 0.1 molar triethylamine acetate (TEAA).</p>
    <p>The fraction containing the crude labeled oligonucleotide is further purified by reverse phase HPLC employing gradient elution.</p>
    <p>IV. Methods Utilizing the Compounds/Reagents of the Invention</p>
    <p>The dyes and reagents of the present invention are well suited to any method utilizing fluorescent detection, particularly methods requiring the simultaneous detection of multiple spatially-overlapping analytes. Dyes and reagents of the invention are particularly well suited for identifying classes of polynucleotides that have been subjected to a biochemical separation procedure, such as electrophoresis, or that have been distributed among locations in a spatially-addressable hybridization array.</p>
    <p>In a preferred category of methods referred to herein as "fragment analysis" or "genetic analysis" methods, labeled polynucleotide fragments are generated through template-directed enzymatic synthesis using labeled primers or nucleotides, e.g., by ligation or polymerase-directed primer extension; the fragments are subjected to a size-dependent separation process, e.g., electrophoresis or chromatography; and, the separated fragments are detected subsequent to the separation, e.g., by laser-induced fluorescence. In a particularly preferred embodiment, multiple classes of polynucleotides are separated simultaneously and the different classes are distinguished by spectrally resolvable labels.</p>
    <p>One such fragment analysis method known as amplified fragment length polymorphisim detection (AmpFLP) is based on amplified fragment length polymorphisms, i.e., restriction fragment length polymorphisms that are amplified by PCR. These amplified fragments of varying size serve as linked markers for following mutant genes through families. The closer the amplified fragment is to the mutant gene on the chromosome, the higher the linkage correlation. Because genes for many genetic disorders have not been identified, these linkage markers serve to help evaluate disease risk or paternity. In the AmpFLPs technique, the polynucleotides may be labeled by using a labeled polynucleotide PCR primer, or by utilizing labeled nucleotide triphosphates in the PCR.</p>
    <p>In another such fragment analysis method known as nick translation, a reaction is used to replace unlabeled nucleoside triphosphates in a double-stranded DNA molecule with labeled ones. Free 3'-hydroxyl groups are created within the unlabeled DNA by "nicks" caused by deoxyribonuclease I (DNAase I) treatment. DNA polymerase I then catalyzes the addition of a labeled nucleotide to the 3'-hydroxyl terminus of the nick. At the same time, the 5' to 3'-exonuclease activity of this enzyme eliminates the nucleotide unit from the 5'-phosphoryl terminus of the nick. A new nucleotide with a free 3'-OH group is incorporated at the position of the original excised nucleotide, and the nick is shifted along by one nucleotide unit in the 3' direction. This 3' shift will result in the sequential addition of new labeled nucleotides to the DNA with the removal of existing unlabeled nucleotides. The nick-translated polynucleotide is then analyzed using a separation process, e.g., electrophoresis.</p>
    <p>Another exemplary fragment analysis method is based on variable number of tandem repeats, or VNTRs. VNTRs are regions of double-stranded DNA that contain adjacent multiple copies of a particular sequence, with the number of repeating units being variable. Examples of VNTR loci are pYNZ22, pMCT118, and Apo B. A subset of VNTR methods are those methods based on the detection of microsatellite repeats, or short tandem repeats (STRs), i.e., tandem repeats of DNA characterized by a short (2-4 bases) repeated sequence. One of the most abundant interspersed repetitive DNA families in humans is the (dC-dA)n-(dG-dT)n dinucleotide repeat family (also called the (CA)n dinucleotide repeat family). There are thought to be as many as 50,000 to 100,000 (CA)n repeat regions in the human genome, typically with 15-30 repeats per block. Many of these repeat regions are polymorphic in length and can therefore serve as useful genetic markers. Preferably, in VNTR or STR methods, label is introduced into the polynucleotide fragments by using a dye-labeled PCR primer.</p>
    <p>In a particularly preferred fragment analysis method, classes identified in accordance with the invention are defined in terms of terminal nucleotides so that a correspondence is established between the four possible terminal bases and the members of a set of spectrally resolvable dyes. Such sets are readily assembled from the dyes of the invention by measuring emission and absorption bandwidths with commercially available spectrophotometers. More preferably, the classes arise in the context of the chemical or chain termination methods of DNA sequencing, and most preferably the classes arise in the context of the chain termination methods, i.e., dideoxy DNA sequencing, or Sanger-type sequencing. Sanger-type sequencing involves the synthesis of a DNA strand by a DNA polymerase in vitro using a single-stranded or double-stranded DNA template whose sequence is to be determined. Synthesis is initiated at a defined site based on where an oligonucleotide primer anneals to the template. The synthesis reaction is terminated by incorporation of a nucleotide analog that will not support continued DNA elongation. Exemplary chain-terminating nucleotide analogs include the 2',3'-dideoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphates (ddNTPs) which lack the 3'-OH group necessary for 3' to 5' DNA chain elongation. When proper proportions of dNTPs (2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphates) and one of the four ddNTPs are used, enzyme-catalyzed polymerization will be terminated in a fraction of the population of chains at each site where the ddNTP is incorporated. If labeled primers or labeled ddNTPs are used for each reaction, the sequence information can be detected by fluorescence after separation by high-resolution electrophoresis. In the chain termination method, dyes of the invention can be attached to either sequencing primers or dideoxynucleotides. Dyes can be linked to a complementary functionality on the 5'-end of the primer, e.g. following the teaching in Fung et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,757,141; on the base of a primer; or on the base of a dideoxynucleotide, e.g. via the alkynylamino linking groups disclosed by Hobbs et al, supra.</p>
    <p>In each of the above fragment analysis methods labeled polynucleotides are preferably separated by electrophoretic procedures, e.g. Gould and Matthews, cited above; Rickwood and Hames, Eds., Gel Electrophoresis of Nucleic Acids: A Practical Approach, IRL Press Limited, London, 1981; Osterman, Methods of Protein and Nucleic Acid Research, Vol. 1 Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1984; or U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,374,527, 5,624,800 and/or 5,552,028. Preferably the type of electrophoretic matrix is crosslinked or uncrosslinked polyacrylamide having a concentration (weight to volume) of between about 2-20 weight percent. More preferably, the polyacrylamide concentration is between about 4-8 percent. Preferably in the context of DNA sequencing in particular, the electrophoresis matrix includes a denaturing agent, e.g., urea, formamide, and the like. Detailed procedures for constructing such matrices are given by Maniatis et al., "Fractionation of Low Molecular Weight DNA and RNA in Polyacrylamide Gels Containing 98% Formamide or 7 M Urea," in Methods in Enzymology, 65: 299-305 (1980); Maniatis et al., "Chain Length Determination of Small Double- and Single-Stranded DNA Molecules by Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis," Biochemistry, 14: 3787-3794 (1975); Maniatis et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York, pgs. 179-185 (1982); and ABI PRISM™ 377 DNA Sequencer User's Manual, Rev. A, January 1995, Chapter 2 (p/n 903433, The Perkin-Elmer Corporation, Foster City, Calif.). The optimal electrophoresis conditions, e.g., polymer concentration, pH, temperature, concentration of denaturing agent, employed in a particular separation depends on many factors, including the size range of the nucleic acids to be separated, their base compositions, whether they are single stranded or double stranded, and the nature of the classes for which information is sought by electrophoresis. Accordingly application of the invention may require standard preliminary testing to optimize conditions for particular separations.</p>
    <p>Subsequent to electrophoretic separation, the dye-polynucleotide conjugates are detected by measuring the fluorescence emission from the dye labeled polynucleotides. To perform such detection, the labeled polynucleotides are illuminated by standard means, e.g. high intensity mercury vapor lamps, lasers, or the like. Preferably the illumination means is a laser having an illumination beam at a wavelength between 488 and 550 nm. More preferably, the dye-polynucleotides are illuminated by laser light generated by an argon ion laser, particularly the 488 and 514 nm emission lines of an argon ion laser, or an the 532 emission line of a neodymium solid-state YAG laser. Several argon ion lasers are available commercially which lase simultaneously at these lines, e.g. Cyonics, Ltd. (Sunnyvale, Calif.) Model 2001, or the like. The fluorescence is then detected by a light-sensitive detector, e.g., a photomultiplier tube, a charged coupled device, or the like. Exemplary electrophoresis detection systems are described elsewhere, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,543,026; 5,274,240; 4,879,012; 5,091,652 and 4,811,218.</p>

The dye was crystallized from chloroform to yield 450 mg (81%) of pure dye.</p>
    <heading>Example 16</heading> <heading>Synthesis of Aromatic-Substituted Xanthene Dye (35)</heading> <p>Dibenzofuran-1,3-diol (prepared according to Carvalho, C. F. et. Al. supra) (200 mg, 1 mmoL), 2-fluoronaphthalene-1,3-diol 34 (178 mg, 1 mmol, AB part #361828 ), and 2,5-dichloro trimellitic anhydride (260 mg, 1 mmoL, AB part# 361892) were mixed in methanesulfonic acid (10 mL) and stirred at 130-135° C. for 2 hrs. The reaction mixture was cooled and mixed with ice water (100 mL). The precipitated dye was extracted with ethyl acetate (100 mL), and the organic layer was washed with water (50 mL×2) and brine (50 mL×1), dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and the solvent was removed to yield the crude dye as an isomeric mixture. Isomers were separated by preparative thin-layer chromatography, yielding 80 mg (13%) of dye.</p>
    <heading>Example 17</heading> <heading>Synthesis of Aromatic-Substituted Xanthene Dye (36)</heading> <p>Napthyl-fluoro-resorcinol ketone 24 from Example 8 (206 mg, 0.4 mmol), and 2-fluoronaphthalene-1,3-diol 34 (72 mg, 0.4 mmol, AB part # 361828) were mixed with methane sulfonic acid (4 mL) and stirred at 120-130° C. for 2 hrs. The solution was cooled to room temperature and then poured into ice-water (100 mL). The precipitated dye was extracted with ethyl acetate (100 mL), and the organic layer was washed with water (50 mL×2) and brine (50 mL×1), dried with sodium sulfate, filtered, and the solvent was removed to yield the crude dye, which was further purified by crystallization from chloroform to yield 120mg (45%) of pure dye.</p>
    <heading>Example 18</heading> <heading>Synthesis of a PCR Primer Labeled with Aromatic-Substituted Xanthene Dye (33)</heading> <p>Aromatic-substituted xanthene dye (33) from Example 15 was converted to the N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester by reacting with 1.2 equivalents of 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride and 1.5 equivalents of N-hydroxysuccinimide in dry DMF for 3 hrs at room temperature. The reaction mixture was mixed with 5% HCl and extracted in ethyl acetate. The extract was washed with water, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to a solid. The solid was dissolved in DMSO (6 mg/66 mL DMSO) forming a dye stock solution. The DMSO dye stock (5-6 mL) was added in excess (10-20×) to an aminohexyl derivatized oligonucleotide PCR primer (1×10<sup>-3</sup> M) in 0.25 M bicarbonate/carbonate buffer (pH 9.4) and allowed to react for 1 hour, where the amino hexyl derivatized primer was prepared using an automated DNA synthesizer where Aminolink-2 reagent was used in the last synthesis cycle (AB p/n 400808). The dye labeled oilgonucleotide was separated from unreacted dye by passing through a Sephadex G-25 size exclusion column eluting with 0.1 molar triethylamine acetate. The fraction containing the crude labeled oligonucleotide was purified by reverse phase HPLC employing gradient elution from 8% acetonitrile in 0.1 M TEAA to 25% over 25 minutes using an RP-18 chromatography column. The pure dye labeled oligonucleotide was lyophilized to a solid. The concentration of the dye labeled oligonucleotide was determined by UV absorption at 260 nm.</p>
    <heading>Example 19</heading> <heading>Evaluation of Relative Fluorescence Intensities of HEX and JEB Labeled PCR Primers</heading> <p>PCR primers D19S221 and D22S423 labeled with aromatic-substituted xanthene dye (33) (JEB) according to Example 18 were compared with the same primers labeled with HEX dye using DNA from CEPH family 884, individual 15 (AM200). The target DNA was amplified according to the standard protocol for the Linkage Mapping Set, published in ABI PRISM™ Linkage Mapping Set User's Manual (AB p/n 903477 ), and evaluated for relative fluorescence intensity on an ABI PRISM™ 377 DNA Sequencer following recommended procedures. The results are summarized below in Table 1.</p>
