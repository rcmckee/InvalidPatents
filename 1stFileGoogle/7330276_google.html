    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p num="p-0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="p-0003">The present invention relates to target detecting apparatuses and target detecting processes which can detect various targets such as pathogens, biological substances and toxic substances without using a costly measuring apparatus, which can detect these targets with a low measurement error, high efficiency, simplicity, speed and sensitivity, and which can make a quantitative detection thereof. The present invention also relates to target detection substrates and optical interference substrates which can suitably be used in such apparatuses and processes.</p>
    <p num="p-0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="p-0005">In the related art, various kinds of processes have been considered for detecting targets such as pathogens, biological substances and toxic substances, for example, enzyme immunoassay methods such as ELISA. However, in these processes, there was the problem of having to use expensive fluorescent labels or dangerous radiation markers.</p>
    <p num="p-0006">Recently, apparatuses and processes have been proposed which detect targets by detecting an interference color change of interference light by a detection layer without using a fluorescence label or a radiation marker. For example, an apparatus has been proposed which measures a thickness change of a nonspecific protein layer as an interference color change using an ellipsometer or the like (e.g., JP-A No. 2002-122603 and JP-A No. 2002-116208). In other proposals, a thickness change is detected as an interference color change in a light reflecting surface by a nucleic acid chain (e.g., Japanese Patent Application Publication (JP-B) No. 07-32720, JP-A No. 10-288616 and JP-A No. 2001-235473). Apparatuses have been proposed wherein light emitted from a light source is irradiated onto a sample surface via a polarizer, the reflected light is reflected by a polarization modulator, and then detected via a polarizer (e.g., JP-A No. 61-34442, JP-A No. 04-78122, JP-B No. 62-57936 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,332,476). Moreover, an apparatus has been proposed which measures a thickness change of a nonspecific protein layer as an interference color change using an ellipsometer or the like, and detects this interference light via a polarizer (e.g., JP-A No. 2002-122603).</p>
    <p num="p-0007">However, in these proposals, specific wavelength peaks are measured using an interference filter, a multi-layered structure of optical interference substrates made of silicon nitride, silica, titania, or the like. These proposals therefore have low manufacturing efficiency and high cost. In addition, simple and quick measurement cannot be performed, and there are problems in that the apparatus easily picks up measurement noise, the measurement error is large, measurement sensitivity is poor and a quantitative measurement cannot be made. Thus, there are currently no target detecting apparatuses and target detecting processes which can detect various targets such as pathogens, biological substances and toxic substances without using a costly measuring apparatus, which can detect these targets with a low measurement error, high efficiency, simplicity, speed and sensitivity, and which can make a quantitative detection thereof. Also, there are no target detection substrates and optical interference substrates which can suitably be used in such apparatuses and processes.</p>

    </description-of-drawings> <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading> <p num="h-0006">Target Detecting Apparatus</p>
    <p num="p-0062">The target detecting apparatus of the present invention comprises an optical irradiation unit, an optical interference unit, a wavelength change detecting unit and other unit which may be suitably selected as necessary.</p>
    <p num="h-0007">Optical Irradiation Unit</p>
    <p num="p-0063">The optical irradiation unit is not particularly limited provided that it irradiates light, and may be selected according to the purpose from light sources known in the art such as for example a halogen lamp (e.g., xenon lamp) or a laser light irradiation device.</p>
    <p num="p-0064">Among these, a laser light irradiation device is preferred as it can irradiate a linear luminous flux. In this case, it is easy to control the incidence angle of the light irradiated from this optical irradiation unit to the optical interference unit. Other advantages are that the area of the light-receiving surface in the optical interference unit irradiated by light from the optical irradiation unit can be designed small; that the light-receiving surface of the wavelength change detecting unit which detects the wavelength change of the interference light due to the optical interference unit, can be designed small; that measurement noise can be controlled; and that measurement errors can be reduced.</p>
    <p num="p-0065">In the present invention, when a spectrophotometer is used as the wavelength change detecting unit, a light source built into this spectrophotometer can be used as the optical irradiation unit.</p>
    <p num="h-0008">Optical Interference Unit</p>
    <p num="p-0066">The optical interference unit can change the wavelength of interference light of the light irradiated by the optical light irradiation unit through interaction with targets and wavelength changers. The optical interference unit includes a target detection substrate of the present invention and may further include other members if necessary. The target detection substrate includes, on the optical interference substrate of the present invention, a target interaction part capable of interacting at least with the targets.</p>
    <p num="h-0009">Optical Interference Substrate</p>
    <p num="p-0067">The optical interference substrate according to the present invention includes a substrate and a different refractive index film having a different refractive index from that of the substrate disposed on the substrate, and interferes irradiated light to radiate it as interference light where the total number of peak tops and peak bottoms in a graph of transmittance against wavelength of the interference light is from 1 to 20 in an arbitrary wavelength range of 100 nm.</p>
    <p num="p-0068">The optical interference substrate is not particularly limited and may be selected suitably according to the purpose provided that the total number of peak tops and peak bottoms in a graph of transmittance against wavelength of the interference light is from 1 to 20 in an arbitrary wavelength range of 100 nm. However, the total number is preferably from 1 to 15, and more preferably from 1 to 10.</p>
    <p num="p-0069">When the total number of peak tops and peak bottoms exceeds 20 in an arbitrary wavelength range of 100 nm, the change of spectrum (peak shift) due to the detection reaction (interaction) may become indistinguishable, and therefore is not preferable.</p>
    <p num="p-0070">Preferably, in the optical interference substrate, the difference of transmittance of a peak top and that of an adjacent peak bottom in a graph of transmittance against wavelength of the interference light within a wavelength range of from 300 nm to 800 nm is 40% or less, more preferably 35% or less, and particularly preferably 30% or less.</p>
    <p num="p-0071">When the difference of transmittances is 40% or less, ripples can be observed in a graph of transmittance against wavelength where the differences of peak tops and peak bottoms are substantially constant. To form a peak as a main wavelength where the difference of transmittances of a peak top and that of an adjacent peak bottom exceeds 40%, it generally requires an interference filter having a substrate and multiple layers with different refractive indices provided thereon. Whereas interference filters are low in manufacturing efficiency and high in cost, the optical interference substrate according to the present invention can be manufactured efficiently at low cost and is advantageous in that it includes at least one layer of a different refractive index film on the surface of the substrate. Moreover, by applying the optical interference substrate to a target detection substrate and a target detection apparatus, the target detection substrate and the target detection apparatus will in turn become advantageous in that they can be manufactured efficiently at low cost.</p>
    <p num="p-0072">The substrate is not particularly limited and may suitably be selected according to the purpose provided that a different refractive index film can be deposited on the surface. Suitable examples of the substrate include articles formed from semiconductors, ceramics, metal, glass, silica glass, plastics, and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0073">The shape of the substrate is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected according to the purpose, but a tabular shape is preferable.</p>
    <p num="p-0074">The different refractive index film is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected according to the purpose provided that it has a refractive index different from that of the substrate. Examples include a film containing an oxygen-containing compound.</p>
    <p num="p-0075">The oxygen-containing compound is not particularly limited and can be suitably selected from among oxygen-containing compounds known in the art. Examples include metal oxides, non-metal oxides, and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0076">The metal oxide is not particularly limited and can be suitably selected from among metal oxides known in the art. Examples include Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub>, and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0077">The non-metal oxide is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected from among non-metal oxides known in the art.</p>
    <p num="p-0078">The thickness of the different refractive index film (physical film thickness) is not particularly limited, and may be suitably selected according to the purpose. However, it is preferably 0.01 μm to 100 μm, and more preferably 0.01 μm to 10 μm, and particularly preferably 0.01 μm to 5.0 μm. When the thickness is less than 0.01 μm, the ripples may not appear, and when it is more than 100 μm, too many ripples may be formed, both of which cases are not preferable.</p>
    <p num="p-0079">The density of the different refractive index film is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected according to the purpose. However, it is preferably from 1.0 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>to 3.0 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, more preferably from 1.2 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>to 2.6 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, and particularly preferably from 1.4 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>to 2.6 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. When the density is less than 1.0 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, the different refractive index film will become brittle, leading to inferior resistance of the optical interference substrate. When the density is more than 3.0 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, the number of occurring ripples may be inappropriate. Therefore, both cases are not preferable.</p>
    <p num="p-0080">The process for providing a different refractive index film on the surface of the substrate is not particularly limited and may be provided according to a film-forming technique known in the art. Suitable examples include EB (electron beam) vapor deposition, ion assisted deposition, ion plating, and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0081">The optical interference substrate according to the present invention has a different refractive index film provided on a substrate so that it interferes irradiated light to radiate it as interference light even if the different refractive index film is formed of one layer; forms ripples in a graph of transmittance against wavelength of the interference light; may be suitably used in various target detection substrates, target detection apparatuses, and the like based on wavelength change using ripples; and, in particular, may be suitably used in target detection substrates, target detection apparatuses, and target detection processes according to the present invention described below.</p>
    <p num="h-0010">Target Interaction Part</p>
    <p num="p-0082">The target interaction part is not particularly limited provided that it can interact with the target, and may be suitably selected according to the purpose, but it is preferred that it can interact with the target by at least one of physical adsorption and chemical adsorption. More preferably, the target interaction part is a target acceptor which can capture the target.</p>
    <p num="p-0083">The position where the target interaction part is provided is not particularly limited. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a target acceptor <b>20</b> <i>a </i>as the target interaction part may be directly provided on a different refractive index film <b>22</b>, or, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, may be provided in a film-like material <b>50</b> on an optical interference substrate <b>20</b> <i>c. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0084">The process by which the target acceptor is directly provided on the optical interference substrate is not particularly limited and any process known in the art may be used. Examples include a process in which the optical interference substrate is immersed in a buffer solution containing the target acceptor so that the target acceptor is supported by the substrate.</p>
    <p num="h-0011">Film-like Material</p>
    <p num="p-0085">In case where the target interaction part is provided on the optical interference substrate via the film-like material, the film-like material is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected according to the purpose, for example it may be formed from the rod-shaped material.</p>
    <p num="p-0086">The thickness of the film-like material may be suitably selected according to the wavelength of the interference light before and after wavelength change, the refractive index of the substrate, etc., but for example, it is preferably 50 nm to 1 μm.</p>
    <p num="p-0087">In the present invention, one or more films may be further provided on the surface of the film-like material. This film is not particularly limited and may be selected according to the purpose, but it is preferred that the film has a refractive index which is substantially equivalent to the refractive index of the substrate surface in contact with the film-like material. In this case, interference light having a sharp spectral curve can be radiated, and even if the wavelength change (wavelength shift) of this interference light is very small, it can be detected simply, reliably, rapidly and with high sensitivity.</p>
    <p num="p-0088">The film is not particularly limited and a suitably selected film may be used, but a dielectric film may for example be mentioned. The dielectric film may be formed on the surface of the film-like material according to, for example, a known process. Specifically, gold, silver, platinum, platinum/palladium, or the like may be selected as materials for the dielectric film, and a thin layer of these materials may be formed by ion coater or the like on the surface of the film-like material. The material of the dielectric is not limited to the above, and may also be an oxide such as silicon oxide.</p>
    <p num="p-0089">In an aspect where the target detection substrate comprises the dielectric film on the surface of the film-like material, the whole optical interference unit or whole target detection substrate functions as the interference filter. In this case, it is advantageous in that it can be manufactured efficiently at low cost, as opposed to general interference filters.</p>
    <p num="p-0090">In addition to the target detecting apparatus or the target detection process of the present invention, this target detection substrate may also be used in fields such as colorimeter, flame photometer, monochromator, laser, optical communications and optical recording.</p>
    <p num="h-0012">Rod-shaped Material</p>
    <p num="p-0091">The rod material is not particularly limited and can be suitably selected according to the purpose, for example a rod-shaped inorganic molecule or a rod-shaped organic molecule.</p>
    <p num="p-0092">One of these may be used alone, or two or more may be used together. Among these, a rod-shaped organic molecule is preferred from the viewpoints that it easily interacts with the target, molecular treatment is easy, formation of the film-like material is easy, and even if the surface quality of the undersurface of the film-like material is not smooth, the surface on the opposite side can easily be maintained smooth.</p>
    <p num="p-0093">The rod-shaped organic molecule is not particularly limited and can be suitably selected according to the purpose, e.g., a biopolymer or a polysaccharide.</p>
    <p num="p-0094">Examples of the biopolymer include a fibrous protein, an α-helix polypeptide, and a nucleic acid (DNA, RNA). Examples of this fibrous protein include those having an α-helix structure such as α-keratin, myosin, epidermin, fibrinogen, tropomycin and silk fibroin.</p>
    <p num="p-0095">The polysaccharide may for example be amylose or the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0096">From the viewpoint of stably maintaining the rod-shape of the organic molecule, a helical molecule wherein the molecule has a helical structure is preferred. In this case, even if the surface quality (e.g., the surface quality of the optical interference substrate) of the undersurface of the film-like material is not smooth, the surface (upper surface) (surface on which light is incident from the optical irradiation unit) on the opposite side can easily be maintained smooth, and measurement errors of wavelength variation produced when the surface is not smooth, can be reduced.</p>
    <p num="p-0097">Among those mentioned above, the spiral molecule may be an α-helix polypeptide, DNA, amylose, etc.</p>
    <p num="h-0013">α-helix Polypeptide</p>
    <p num="p-0098">The α-helix polypeptide is one of the secondary structures of a polypeptide. It is rotated once (forms one spiral) every 3.6 amino acid residues, forms substantially parallel hydrogen bonds with the spiral axis between the imido group (—NH—) and carbonyl group (—CO—) every fourth amino acid, and has a structure which is stable energywise due to the repetition of 7 amino acids as one unit.</p>
    <p num="p-0099">The direction of the helix of the α-helix polypeptide is not particularly limited, and may be right-handed or left-handed. Due to stability factors, only α-helix polypeptides having a right-handed helix are found in nature.</p>
    <p num="p-0100">The amino acid which forms the α-helix polypeptide is not particularly limited and may be selected according to the purpose if it can form an α-helix structure. Amino acids which can easily form this α-helix structure are preferred, examples of such amino acids being aspartic acid (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu), arginine (Arg), lysine (Lys), histidine (His), asparagine (Asn), glutamine (Gln), serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), alanine (Ala), valine (Val), leucine (Leu), isoleucine (Ile), cysteine (Cys), methionine (Met), thyrosin (Tyr), phenylalanine (Phe) and tryptophan (Trp). One of these may be used alone, or two or more may be used together.</p>
    <p num="p-0101">By suitably selecting the amino acid, the α-helix polypeptide can be designed to have hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity or amphiphilicity. If hydrophilicity is conferred, the amino acid may for example be serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), aspartic acid (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu), arginine (Arg), lysine (Lys), asparagine (Asn) or glutamine (Gln). If hydrophibicity is to be conferred, the amino acid may for example be phenylalanine (Phe), tryptophan (Trp), isoleucine (Ile), thyrosin (Tyr), methionine (Met), leucine (Leu) or valine (Val).</p>
    <p num="p-0102">The amino acid forming the α-helix polypeptide is not particularly limited, and may for example be a L-amino acid or D-amino acid, or a derivative thereof wherein the side chains are modified.</p>
    <p num="p-0103">In the α-helix polypeptide, by esterifying the carboxyl group in the amino acid which forms this α-helix which does not form a peptide linkage, hydrophobicity can be conferred. Moreover, hydrophilicity can be conferred by hydrolyzing this esterified carboxyl group.</p>
    <p num="p-0104">The number of linkages (polymerization degree) of the amino acid in the α-helix polypeptide is not particularly limited and can be suitably selected according to the purpose, but it is preferably 10 to 5000.</p>
    <p num="p-0105">If the number of linkages (polymerization degree) is less than 10, the polyamino acid may not be able to form a stable α-helix, and if the number of linkages (polymerization degree) is more than 5000, it may become difficult to orient it in a perpendicular direction.</p>

    <p num="p-0110">The synthesis of the α-helix polypeptide is not limited to the above, and can also be achieved by genetic engineering. For example, a host cell is transformed by an expression vector incorporating DNA which codes for the polypeptide, and this transformant is then cultured.</p>
    <p num="p-0111">Examples of this expression vector are a plasmid vector, a phage vector, or the chimera vector of a plasmid and phage.</p>
    <p num="p-0112">Examples of the host cell are prokaryon microorganisms such as <i>Escherichia coli </i>and <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, eukaryon microorganisms such as yeast fungus, and animal cells.</p>

    <p num="h-0014">DNA</p>
    <p num="p-0114">The DNA may be single-stranded DNA, but from the viewpoint of stabilizing the rod shape, it is preferred that it is double-stranded DNA.</p>
    <p num="p-0115">The double-stranded DNA has a double helix structure wherein two right-handed helical polynucleotide chains are positioned so that they extend in mutually opposite directions around one central axis.</p>
    <p num="p-0116">The polynucleotide chain is formed by four kinds of nucleic acid bases, i.e., adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) and cytosine (C). In the polynucleotide chain, the nucleic acid bases mutually project inside a plane perpendicular to the central axis, forming the so-called Watson-Crick base pairs wherein thymine is specifically hydrogen-bonded to adenine, and cytosine is specifically hydrogen-bonded to guanine, respectively. As a result, in the double-stranded DNA, two polypeptide chains are joined together complementarily.</p>
    <p num="p-0117">The DNA can be prepared by the PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) method, the LCR (Ligase Chain Reaction) method, the 3SR (Self-sustained Sequence Replication) method, the SDA (Strand Displacement Amplification) method, and other methods known in the art, but among these, the PCR method is preferred.</p>
    <p num="p-0118">The DNA may be directly cut out enzymatically with a restriction enzyme from a natural gene, prepared by a gene cloning method, or prepared by a chemosynthesis method.</p>
    <p num="p-0119">In the case of the gene cloning method, the DNA can be prepared in large amounts by incorporating the product of amplifying a normal nucleic acid into a vector selected from a plasmid vector, a phage vector or the chimera vector of a plasmid and phage, and introducing it into an arbitrary host capable of multiplication selected from a prokaryon microorganism such as <i>Escherichia coli </i>or <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, eukaryon microorganism such as yeast fungus, or animal cells.</p>
    <p num="p-0120">The chemosynthesis method may be a liquid phase process such as the triester method and phosphorous acid method, or a solid phase synthetic process using an insoluble carrier. In the case of the chemosynthesis method, after preparing single-stranded DNA in large amount using an automatic synthesis machine known in the art, double-stranded DNA can be prepared by performing annealing.</p>

    <p num="p-0127">The rod-shaped organic molecule may be completely lipophilic (hydrophobic), hydrophilic, or amphiphilic wherein part is lipophilic (hydrophobic) or hydrophilic, and the other part has the opposite affinity to this part.</p>
    <p num="p-0128">The wavelength of the interference light due to the optical interference unit may or may not be in the visible light region. The former case is preferred as the wavelength of the interference light can be detected visually, and it is more preferred that the wavelength of the interference light be in the visible light region after wavelength change. In this case, this interference light can be observed as an interference color, the principle whereby this interference color is observed being based on so-called structural color formation.</p>
    <p num="h-0016">Structural Color Formation</p>
    <p num="p-0129">Reflection of the incident light as the colored interference light is a color formation (color of interference light) in which, when an external stimulus, such as an electric field, a magnetic field, heat, light (e.g., natural light, infrared light, ultraviolet light), or the like, is applied to the film, light of a specific wavelength is reflected in accordance with the thickness of the film and the refractive index thereof, on the basis of the multilayer thin-film interference theory which is the basic principle of color formation of the scaly powder of the wings of a Morpho butterfly. As a result, color formation (colored interference light) occurs at the surface of the film. In the structural color formation, a dye or pigment is unnecessary.</p>

    <p num="p-0135">By suitably changing the thickness, the color (wavelength) of the structural color can be changed.</p>
    <p num="p-0136">The film-like material may be a monomolecular film of the rod material, a laminated film of this monomolecular film, a self-assembled film, a graft polymer film, or the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0137">The process for forming the film-like material is not particularly limited and an appropriate film-forming process known in the art may be used. Examples include coating, Langmuir-Blodgett method (LB method), self-assembly, graft copolymerization, and the like. In the case where the film-like material is formed by Langmuir-Blodgett method (LB method), an LB film-forming apparatus known in the art (e.g., NL-LB400 NK-MWC, Japan Laser &amp; Electronics Laboratories) can be used.</p>
    <p num="p-0138">The monomolecular film-like material can be formed on the optical interference substrate <b>20</b> <i>c </i>using an extrusion member <b>60</b>, for example in the state where lipophilic (hydrophobic) or amphiphilic rod-shaped organic molecules are floating on a water surface (aqueous phase), or the state where hydrophilic or amphiphilic rod-shaped organic molecules are floating on an oil surface (oil phase), i.e., a state wherein the rod-shaped organic molecules <b>30</b> are oriented as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. By repeating this operation, a laminated film comprising a desired number of monomolecular films can be formed on the optical interference substrate <b>20</b> <i>c. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0139">At this time, it is preferred to give the surface of the optical interference substrate <b>20</b> <i>c </i>a surface treatment for the purpose of making the rod-shaped organic molecules <b>30</b> adhere or bond, for example if the rod-shaped organic molecule <b>30</b> (e.g., an α-helix polypeptide) is hydrophilic, it is preferred to first perform a surface treatment beforehand, such as hydrophilization treatment using octadecyl trimethylsiloxane or the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0140">When the monomolecular film of amphiphilic rod-shaped organic molecules <b>30</b> is formed, the state wherein the rod-shaped organic molecules <b>30</b> float on the oil phase or aqueous phase is such that the lipophilic parts (hydrophobic parts) <b>30</b> <i>a </i>are oriented adjacent to each other, and the hydrophilic parts <b>30</b> <i>b </i>are oriented adjacent to each other in the rod-shaped organic molecules <b>30</b> on the aqueous phase or oil phase, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
    <p num="p-0141">Described above is an example of a monomolecular film wherein the rod-shaped organic molecules are oriented in the plane direction of the monomolecular film (laid horizontally) or a laminated film comprising monomolecular films. A monomolecular film wherein the rod-shaped organic molecules are oriented in the thickness direction of the monomolecular film (standing state) can be formed for example as described below. Specifically, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A</figref> and B, first, the pH of the water (aqueous phase) is adjusted to an alkalinity of about 12 with the amphiphilic rod-shaped organic molecules <b>30</b> (α-helix polypeptide) floating on the water surface (aqueous phase). As a result, the hydrophilic parts <b>30</b> <i>b </i>of the rod-shaped organic molecules <b>30</b> (α-helix polypeptide) lose the α-helix structure and take up a random configuration. At this time, the lipophilic parts (hydrophobic parts) <b>30</b> <i>a </i>of the rod-shaped organic molecules <b>30</b> (α-helix polypeptide) retain their α-helix structure. Next, the pH of the water (aqueous phase) is adjusted to an acidity of about 5. As a result, the hydrophilic parts <b>30</b> <i>b </i>of the rod-shaped organic molecules <b>30</b> (α-helix polypeptide) again take up an α-helix structure. At this time, a pressure member brought into contact with the rod-shaped organic molecules <b>30</b> (α-helix polypeptide) presses the rod-shaped organic molecules <b>30</b> (α-helix polypeptide) by air pressure from the side in the direction indicated by the arrows, and the rod-shaped organic molecules <b>30</b> remain standing on the water (aqueous phase) and the hydrophilic parts <b>30</b> <i>b </i>become oriented effectively perpendicular to the water surface in the aqueous phase to take up an α-helix structure. Hence, as described above referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a monomolecular film can be formed on an optical interference substrate <b>20</b> <i>c </i>by extruding on the optical interference substrate <b>20</b> <i>c </i>using a pressure member <b>60</b> with the rod-shaped organic molecules <b>30</b> (α-helix polypeptide) aligned in an orderly manner. By repeating this operation, a laminated film comprising a desired number of monomolecular films can be formed on the optical interference substrate <b>20</b> <i>c. </i> </p>
    <p num="p-0142">The method of bonding the target acceptor to the rod-shaped organic molecules (rod-shaped object) is not particularly limited and can be suitably selected according to the type of target acceptor and rod-shaped organic molecules. Examples include the method of using covalent bonds such as ester bonds or amide bonds; the method wherein avidin is bonded to a protein, which is then bonded to a biotin-modified capturing acceptor; the method wherein a protein is labeled with streptavidin, and bonded to a biotin-modified capturing structure; and the like.</p>
    <p num="p-0143">In the target detection apparatus according to the present invention, due to the use of these methods, any desired target acceptor can easily be bonded to the rod-shaped organic molecules, so unlike the case where this target acceptor is directly bonded to the substrate, the target acceptor or target can be freely selected over a wide range, the target detection apparatus can be used for a wide range of applications regardless of the detection purpose or type of target, and as the surface of the target acceptor can be kept smooth, wavelength variation unevenness of the interference light and measurement errors are small, so detection can be performed with high sensitivity.</p>
    <p num="p-0144">Examples of using covalent bonds are the peptide method, diazo method, alkylation, cyanogen bromide activation, bonding by crosslinking agent, the fixing method using the Ugi reaction, the fixing method using a thiol disulfide exchange reaction, the Schiff base-forming method, the chelate bond method, the tosyl chloride method and biochemical-specific bonding, but to obtain more stable bonds such as covalent bonds, methods using the reaction of a thiol group with a maleimide group, the reaction of a pyridyl disulfide group with a thiol group and the reaction of an amino group with an aldehyde group are preferred, and the method of using a chemical binder or crosslinking agent is more preferred.</p>
    <p num="p-0145">Examples of such chemical binders and crosslinking agents are carbodiimides, isocyanates, diazo compounds, benzoquinones, aldehydes, periodic acids, maleimido compounds and pyrydyl disulfide compounds. Specific examples thereof are glutaraldehyde, hexamethylene diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisothiocyanate, N,N′-polymethylene bis-iodine acetamide, N,N′-ethylene bis-maleimide, ethylene glycol bis-succinimidyl succinate, bis-diazobenzidine, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl amino propyl) carbodiimide, succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP), N-succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimido methyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC), N-sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimido methyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, N-succinimidyl (4-iodine acetyl)aminobenzoate, N-succinimidyl 4-(1-maleimidophenyl) butyrate, iminothioran, S-acetyl mercaptosuccinic acid anhydride, methyl-3-(4′-dithiopyrydyl)propionimidate, methyl-4-mercaptobutylylimidate, methyl-3-mercapto propionimidate and N-succinimidyl-S-acetyl mercaptoacetate.</p>
    <p num="p-0146">In this case, the target acceptor is not directly bonded to the optical interference substrate, but the target acceptor is bonded to the rod-shaped material, and the rod-shaped material is bonded to the optical interference substrate, so for example if the target acceptor is an organic substance, instead of bonding this directly to the optical interference substrate which is an inorganic substance, it is easier to arrange it on the optical interference substrate via a bond with the rod-shaped material which is also an organic substance, and the target acceptor is also thereby stabilized. Further, even if the optical interference substrate surface is not smooth, the target acceptor can be laid flat, so the light-receiving surface irradiated by the optical irradiation unit can be smoothed, and measurement errors in the wavelength change of the interference light due to the fact that the light-receiving surface is not smooth, can be reduced.</p>

    <p num="h-0018">Wavelength Change Detecting Unit</p>
    <p num="p-0202">The wavelength change detecting unit is provided in the path of the interference light and has a function to detect wavelength change using ripples or the main wavelength in a graph of transmittance against wavelength of the interference light which is irradiated from the optical interference unit.</p>

Preferable examples include, (1) one that only allows light having a specific wavelength to pass through and that can detect this light having the specific wavelength; and (2) one that measures a spectrum before wavelength change of the interference light and a spectrum after wavelength change of the interference light so as to determine and measure the differential spectrum of the two spectra.</p>
    <p num="p-0204">Among these, in the case of the (1), it is possible to detect easily, quickly, and with high sensitivity by prohibiting transmittance of interference light before the target interaction part of the optical interference unit (target detection substrate), target, and wavelength changer interact and form a complex, but by allowing transmittance of interference light having a specific wavelength after the target interaction part of the optical interference unit (target detection substrate), target, and wavelength changer interact and form a complex, changing the wavelength of the interference light to the specific wavelength. Alternatively, by allowing transmittance of interference light having specific wavelength before the target interaction part of the optical interference unit (target detection substrate), target, and wavelength changer interact and form a complex, but by prohibiting transmittance of interference light after the target interaction part of the optical interference unit (target detection substrate), target, and wavelength changer interact and form a complex, changing the wavelength of the interference light. In this way, even if it is very difficult to detect a slight change, i.e., if there is only a slight wavelength change (wavelength shift) by simply measuring the ordinary spectral curve, or even if no peak of main wavelength is formed in the graph of transmittance of the interference light, this can be easily and reliably detected. As the wavelength change detection unit detects the transmission of this interference light, the wavelength change of the interference light can be detected, and the interaction of the target with the optical interference unit, i.e., the presence of this target in the sample, can be detected easily, rapidly and with high sensitivity.</p>
    <p num="p-0205">Further, from the magnitude of the transmitted light (transmitted light intensity), quantitative measurement of the target can be performed. Specifically, a calibration curve is first drawn showing the relation between the transmitted light amount of the interference light (transmitted light intensity) and the target capture amount due to the optical interference unit (target detection substrate). Hence, when the target content is measured for the sample containing the target, if the transmitted light amount of the interference light (transmitted light intensity) is measured, the target amount captured by the optical interference unit (target detection substrate) can be quantitatively measured from this calibration curve.</p>
    <p num="p-0206">Alternatively, in the case of the (2), the spectral difference before and after the wavelength of the interference light has changed, i.e., the differential spectrum, is measured by the wavelength change detecting unit, so even if the change is so slight that it is very difficult to measure by measuring only the ordinary spectral curve, i.e., when there is only a very small wavelength change (wavelength shift), or even if no peak of main wavelength is formed in the graph of transmittance of the interference light, this can be detected with ease and reliability, the wavelength change can be transformed into a spectral intensity, and this can be amplified as desired. As a result, even if the wavelength change is very small of no peak of main wavelength is formed in the graph of transmittance of the interference light, it can be detected as an amplified spectral intensity, and can be detected with high sensitivity by a simple, rapid and highly sensitive detection.</p>
    <p num="p-0207">Further, by measuring the spectral intensity, a quantitative measurement of the target can be performed. Specifically, a calibration curve is first drawn showing the relation between the transmitted light amount of the interference light (transmitted light intensity) and the wavelength intensity in the differential spectrum of the wavelength change (peak shift) of the interference light due to the optical interference unit (target detection substrate), or, a calibration curve is first drawn showing the relation between the wavelength intensity of the differential spectrum and the target amount captured by the optical interference unit (detection target substrate), and when the target content is measured for a sample containing the target, by measuring the wavelength intensity of the differential spectrum of the wavelength change (peak shift) of the interference light, the target amount captured by the interference unit (target detection substrate) can be quantitatively measured from this calibration curve.</p>
    <p num="p-0208">A specific example of (1) is a combination of an interference filter with an optical detection sensor which can detect transmitted light which has passed through the interference filter.

As a result, even if there is only a very slight wavelength change, or even if no peak of main wavelength is formed in the graph of transmittance of the interference light, the optical detection sensor can detect the transmitted interference light, and with high sensitivity. Also, whether the interference filter transmits interference light of a specific wavelength after the target interaction part of the optical interference unit (target detection substrate), target, and wavelength changer interact and form a complex, or whether it transmits interference light of a specific wavelength before the target interaction part of the optical interference unit (target detection substrate), target, and wavelength changer interact and form a complex, if the optical detection sensor measures the transmission amount of interference light, a quantitative measurement of the target can be performed.</p>

    <p num="p-0231">As an example of a substance having wavelength dependency, the wavelength dependency of gold particles will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Since gold particles have high extinction coefficients (the right-hand vertical axis in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) in the lower wavelength range as shown by the curve represented by filled triangles in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, they absorb light irradiated from the optical irradiation unit in the lower wavelength range, particularly from 400 nm to 500 nm, to thereby yield interference light having wavelength dependency.

For example, it is possible to detect easily, quickly, and with high sensitivity by prohibiting transmittance of interference light before the target interaction part of the optical interference unit (target detection substrate), target, and wavelength changer interact and form a complex, but by allowing transmittance of interference light having a specific wavelength after the target interaction part of the optical interference unit (target detection substrate), target, and wavelength changer interact and form a complex, changing the wavelength of the interference light to the specific wavelength. Alternatively, by allowing transmittance of interference light having specific wavelength before the target interaction part of the optical interference unit (target detection substrate), target, and wavelength changer interact and form a complex, but by prohibiting transmittance of interference light after the target interaction part of the optical interference unit (target detection substrate), target, and wavelength changer interact and form a complex, changing the wavelength of the interference light. In this way, even if it is very difficult to detect a slight change, i.e., if there is only a slight wavelength change (wavelength shift) by simply measuring the ordinary spectral curve, or even if no peak of main wavelength is formed in the graph of transmittance of the interference light, this can be easily and reliably detected. As the wavelength change detection unit detects the transmission of this interference light, the wavelength change of the interference light can be detected, and the formation of a complex through the interaction of the target interaction part of the optical interference unit (target detection substrate), the target, and the wavelength changer, i.e., the presence of this target in the sample, can be detected easily, rapidly and with high sensitivity.</p>
    <p num="p-0236">Further, from the magnitude of the transmitted light (transmitted light intensity), quantitative measurement of the target can be performed. Specifically, a calibration curve is first drawn showing the relation between the transmitted light amount of the interference light (transmitted light intensity) and the target capture amount due to the optical interference unit (target detection substrate). Hence, when the target content is measured for the sample containing the target, if the transmitted light amount of the interference light (transmitted light intensity) is measured, the target amount captured by the optical interference unit (target detection substrate) can be quantitatively measured from this calibration curve.</p>
    <p num="p-0237">Alternatively, for example, by measuring the spectral difference before and after the wavelength of the interference light has changed, i.e., the differential spectrum, with the wavelength change detection unit, the detection of wavelength change (wavelength shift) is possible with ease and reliability even if the change is so slight that it is very difficult to measure by measuring only the ordinary spectral curve, i.e., when there is only a very small wavelength change (wavelength shift), or even if no peak of main wavelength is formed in the graph of transmittance of the interference light. In this case, the wavelength change can be transformed into a spectral intensity, and this can be amplified as desired. As a result, even a very small wavelength change can be detected as an amplified spectral intensity, and can be detected with high sensitivity by a simple, rapid and highly sensitive detection.</p>
    <p num="p-0238">Further, by measuring the spectral intensity, a quantitative measurement of the target can be performed. Specifically, a calibration curve is first drawn showing the relation between the transmitted light amount of the interference light (transmitted light intensity) and the wavelength intensity in the differential spectrum of the wavelength change (peak shift) of the interference light due to the optical interference unit (target detection substrate), or, a calibration curve is first drawn showing the relation between the wavelength intensity of the differential spectrum and the target amount captured by the optical interference unit (detection target substrate), and when the target content is measured for a sample containing the target, by measuring the wavelength intensity of the differential spectrum of the wavelength change (peak shift) of the interference light, the target amount captured by the interference unit (target detection substrate) can be quantitatively measured from this calibration curve.</p>
    <p num="p-0239">Hereinbefore described is the step of detecting wavelength change of the process for detecting a target according to the present invention. The step of detecting wavelength change is a step in which the wavelength change of the interference light is detected.</p>
    <p num="p-0240">In the process for detecting a target according to the present invention, by using the target detection substrate as the optical interference unit, it is possible to radiate interference light having a sharp spectral curve, and it is advantageous in that wavelength change (wavelength shift) of the interference light can be simply, reliably and rapidly detected with high sensitivity even if there is only a very slight wavelength change and even if a peak as the main wavelength is not formed in the graph of transmittance of the interference light. Moreover, the process for detection a target according to the present invention may be used in various fields, as it permits detection of various targets such as pathogens, biological substances and toxic substances with efficiency, reliability and ease. Further, these measurements may be performed quantitatively, and it can be conveniently used as a diagnostic process, analysis process, or quantitative measurement process.</p>
    <p num="p-0241">Hereafter, the present invention will be described by means of examples, but it will be understood that the invention should not be construed as being limited thereby.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE 1</heading> <p num="h-0022">Preparation of Optical Interference Substrate</p>
    <p num="p-0242">As the substrate, a glass substrate of 50 mm×50 mm (SCHOTT DESAG AG, B270-SUPERWITE (white plate glass)) was provided. Using Ta2O5 as a target, a layer of Ta2O5 was deposited on the glass substrate by ion assisted deposition to thereby produce an optical interference substrate.</p>
    <p num="p-0243">Light was irradiated from the optical irradiation unit to the optical interference substrate as produced, and a sharp wavelength spectrum having ripples such as the one shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> was observed. Within the wavelength spectrum, the total number of peak tops and peak bottoms in an arbitrary range of 100 nm was from 3 to 6, and the difference of transmittance between a peak top and an adjacent peak bottom was 22% or less.</p>
    <p num="p-0244">The thickness (physical film thickness) and density of the Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>layer were measured, and the thickness was 1.0 μm and the density was 2.45 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
    <p num="p-0245">The optical interference substrate could be prepared by providing one layer of Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>on the glass substrate, and therefore the cost was low and efficiency was high.</p>
    <p num="h-0023">Preparation of Target Detection Substrate</p>
    <p num="p-0246">The optical interference substrate prepared as above was then immersed in a buffer solution (1.5 μM) of biotin, which serves as the target acceptor, for 0.5 hour according to a process known in the art to produce a target detection substrate in which the optical interference substrate supports biotin. The target detection substrate prepared in this manner was taken out of the biotin buffer solution and washed with pure water to remove biotin not supported by the optical interference substrate.</p>
    <p num="p-0247">The preparation was such that the surface area of the target detection substrate was 1.5×10<sup>14 </sup>nm<sup>2 </sup>(10 mm×15 mm).</p>
    <p num="p-0248">The target detection substrate was prepared using the optical interference substrate, and therefore the cost was low and efficiency was high.</p>
    <p num="h-0024">Preparation of Wavelength Changer</p>
    <p num="p-0249">Gold nanoparticles (diameter: 5 nm) as the wavelength changers were deposited on biotin which serves as the target capturing body, and thus wavelength changers were prepared.</p>
    <p num="p-0250">The gold nanoparticles were mixed and reacted with thiolated biotin so as to be supported by the target capturing body.</p>
    <p num="h-0025">Interaction Between Optical Interference Unit, Target, and Wavelength Changer</p>
    <p num="p-0251">The optical interference unit, namely the target detection substrate, was immersed in an aqueous solution (1.5 μM) of avidin, which serves as the target, for 0.5 hour to allow avidin to interact with (reactively adsorb on) biotin, the target acceptor of the optical interference unit. Then, an aqueous solution containing the wavelength changer prepared as above was added dropwise to allow the target acceptor biotin of the optical interference unit, the target avidin, and the target capturing body biotin of the wavelength changer to interact (adsorb).</p>
    <p num="p-0252">The cross-sectional surface area of avidin was a little less than about 30 nm<sup>2 </sup>(3 nm×3 nm×3.14).</p>
    <p num="h-0026">Wavelength Change Detection</p>
    <p num="p-0253">As the optical irradiation unit, the light source of a spectrophotometer (Jasco Corp., V560) was used. Light (xenon lamp light) was irradiated by this optical irradiation unit so that the incidence angle on the optical interference unit was 10°.</p>
    <p num="p-0254">The light-receiving unit of the spectrophotometer (Jasco Corp., V560) was positioned in the path of the reflected light (interference light) from the optical interference unit, the light originating from the optical irradiation unit, to measure the spectral wavelengths of this reflected light (interference light). As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a sharp spectral curve having ripples was observed when only the optical interference substrate was present.</p>
    <p num="p-0255">Then, biotin as the target acceptor of the optical interference unit, avidin as the target, and biotin as the target capturing body of the wavelength changer were interacted (adsorbed), after which interference light of the light irradiated from the optical irradiation unit was measured. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a peak shift of about 12 nm was observed for the peak bottom near 650 nm compared with the peak bottom before the formation of the complex.</p>
    <p num="p-0256">Accordingly, the formation of the complex through interaction (adsorption) of biotin as the target acceptor of the optical interference unit, avidin as the target, and biotin as the target capturing body of the wavelength changer, that is, the existence of avidin as the target was detected.</p>
    <p num="p-0257">In the spectral curve of the interference light, no peak as the main wavelength was formed and only the ripples were obtained. By using the gold nanoparticles as the wavelength changer, light absorption occurs, particularly in the wavelength range of from 400 nm to 500 nm as described above, and a wavelength-dependent spectral curve having ripples was observed. Accordingly, although no peak as the main wavelength was formed, it was possible to detect a peak shift with ease and certainty.</p>
    <p num="h-0027">Calculation of Avidin Adsorption Amount</p>
    <p num="p-0258">The number of avidin adsorptions on the target detection substrate can be calculated by dividing the surface area of the substrate by cross-sectional area of one avidin molecule, and was found to be 1.5×10<sup>14</sup>/3×10<sup>1</sup>=5×10<sup>12 </sup>molecules. Next, the number of adsorbed avidin on this substrate in moles can be calculated by dividing this number of adsorptions by Avogadro's number, and was found to be 5×10<sup>12</sup>/6×10<sup>23</sup>=8.3×10<sup>−12 </sup>M=8.3 pM.</p>
    <p num="p-0259">Therefore, it was found that the avidin adsorption amount for a wavelength shift in the interference light of 12 nm is 8.3 pM.</p>
    <p num="p-0260">Further, when the surface area of the target detection substrate was approximately 5 mm<sup>2</sup>, the wavelength shift (peak bottom shift) of the interference light for an avidin adsorption amount of 1.4 pM, was of the order of 12 nm. Converting this to a weight of avidin, and assuming that the molecular weight of avidin is approximately 68,000, we obtain 1.4×10<sup>−12 </sup>M×68,000=9.5×10<sup>−8 </sup>g (95 ng), which corresponds to an adsorption amount of 7.9 ng for a peak shift (wavelength shift) of 1 nm (7.9 ng/nm).</p>
    <p num="h-0028">&lt;Detection of Wavelength Change by Differential Spectrum Measurement and Quantitative Measurement of Target&gt;</p>
    <p num="p-0261">In some cases, after measuring a spectrum of the interference light of the optical interference substrate and a spectrum of the interference light upon formation of the complex, it may turn out to be difficult to detect wavelength shift of the interference light from the spectrum curve data because no peak as the main wavelength is formed in the spectral curves and wavelength shift is very small. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, when the gold particles having a diameter of 5 nm were replaced with gold particles with a diameter of 0.3 nm, the spectral curve of the 0.3 nm-diameter gold particles and the spectral curve where an organic substance layer was formed on the Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>layer of the optical interference substrate were almost identical to each other, and therefore it was difficult to detect wavelength shift of the interference light from the spectral curve data when the 0.3 nm-diameter gold particles were used as the wavelength changing material. Here, the organic substance layer contained biotin as the target acceptor, avidin as the target, and biotin interacting with each other. However, when the differential spectrum of the two spectral data was taken by the spectrophotometer, the result was as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, and the wavelength difference of the two spectra, which was very difficult to detect in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, could be shown as a large wavelength difference. Therefore, by detecting the differential spectrum, the wavelength difference of the interference light can be detected without measurement error, and with simplicity, rapidity and high sensitivity. This differential spectrum can be obtained as a spectral intensity, and may therefore be amplified as desired by the spectrophotometer. In other words, even if the spectral intensity is very small, it can be detected with high sensitivity by amplification.</p>
    <p num="p-0262">If the procedure below is followed, by measuring the spectral intensity, a quantitative measurement of the target can be performed. Specifically, a calibration curve is first drawn showing the relation between the transmitted light amount of the interference light (transmitted light intensity) and the wavelength intensity in the differential spectrum of the wavelength change (peak shift) of the interference light due to the optical interference unit (target detection substrate), or, a calibration curve is first drawn showing the relation between the wavelength intensity of the differential spectrum and the target amount captured by the optical interference unit (detection target substrate), and when the target content is measured for a sample containing the target, by measuring the wavelength intensity of the differential spectrum of the wavelength change (peak shift) of the interference light, the target amount captured by the interference unit (target detection substrate) can be quantitatively measured from this calibration curve.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE 3</heading> <p num="p-0263">The spectral change (peak shift) of interference light was measured in the same manner as in Example 1 except that the gold particles as the wavelength changing material in Example 1 were replaced with alkanethiolated gold represented by the following Formula (1).</p>
    <p num="p-0264">The alkanethiolated gold was mixed and reacted with thiolated biotin so as to be supported by the target capturing body.</p>

    <p num="p-0266">As a result for the measurement, a spectral curve having ripples similar to the spectral curve of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> where 0.3 nm-diameter gold nanoparticles were used was obtained, and at the peak bottom near 650 nm, a peak shift of about 3 nm compared with the peak bottom before the formation of the complex was observed.</p>
