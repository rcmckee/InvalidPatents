    <p>This application is a division of Ser. No. 08/807,792, filed Feb. 28, 1997.</p>
    <heading>MICROFICHE APPENDIX</heading> <p>A microfiche appendix is submitted with this application having 252 pages and 3 sheets. The microfiche appendix includes a listing or database of images showing a preferred embodiment of practicing the present invention. These images depict one-hundred and five non-limiting examples of preferred treatment modalities according to the invention, but do not exhaust all possibilities for treatment modalities. These images also include four pages of symptom pattern diagrams permitting a selection of treatment modalities according to the present invention.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p>The present invention relates to the field of medical treatments for reducing the size and effect of various adhesions or lesions in soft tissues, such as muscles, tendons, blood vessels, fascia, and nerves. More specifically, medical treatments according to the invention utilize an expert system for directing the non-surgical manual manipulation of soft tissues to identify and treat soft tissue adhesions that cause numbness, pain, and restricted range of motion.</p>
    <p>2. Statement of the Problem</p>
    <p>Unnecessary surgeries are sometimes performed because the medical profession lacks a unified and comprehensive training program for the non-surgical treatment of all types of soft tissue lesions. Prior treatments and training have focused on specific disorders, which results in an ad hoc overall level of expertise in the medical profession and a preference for surgical intervention. Medical practitioners are often unaware of non-surgical treatments offering higher success rates and less trauma to their patients than can be obtained from surgical pr. There is a need for an expert system to guide medical doctors, chiropractors, physical therapists, and occupational therapists in implementing protocols for the non-surgical treatment of all types of soft tissue lesions. This expert system would prevent unnecessary surgeries.</p>
    <p>Historically, a preferred treatment modality has been the surgical excision of lesions, if possible, once they become problematic. These surgeries may not be needed even though they may be commonplace. By way of example, surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome can be performed to divide the transverse carpal ligament in a manner that relieves pressure on the median nerve. U.S. Pat. No. 5,501,657 to Feero reports that surgical techniques intended to relieve the syndrome have a failure rate ranging from 50% to 75%. The '657 patent teaches a non-surgical technique for the relief of pain associated with carpal tunnel syndrome. The massage technique includes stretching muscles of the forearm and hand combined with longitudinal manipulation of the forearm muscles to improve circulation. Even though the '657 patent does not identify a success rate for the technique that it teaches, the technique is said to be more successful than prior surgical techniques.</p>
    <p>Surgical techniques for soft tissue injuries have low success rates because surgery cannot address all of the potential problem areas. Additionally, surgery itself produces trauma. Leahy in <i>New Treatment of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, </i>Chiropractic Sports Medicine (1992) proposed a non-surgical technique for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. Leahy recognized that carpal tunnel syndrome may involve lesions of the carpal canal, the median nerve, the radial nerve, the posterior interosseus nerve, the axilla, the anterior interosseous nerve, and the ulnar nerve. Thus, the blanket designation of ‘carpal tunnel syndrome’ is inadequate to describe the afflicted anatomy with particularity.</p>
    <p>Cumulative Injury Disorders</p>
    <p>Cumulative injury disorders involve the soft tissues, and are now perhaps the most significant injury problem in the United States. Federal injury statistics indicate that cumulative injury disorders have worsened by six hundred and seventy percent in the last five years. A variety of injuries including carpal tunnel syndrome may be classified under the broad heading of cumulative trauma disorders or cumulative injury disorders. These disorders include a group of injuries to the muscles, tendons, bones, blood vessels, fascia, and nerves. The term ‘cumulative injury disorder’ is preferred because actual trauma is not necessarily required to bring about the injury.</p>
    <p>The three basic injury types include acute injuries, repetitive motion injuries, and constant pressure or tension injuries. Acute injuries result from the tearing of muscle and fascia, and are most often associated with immediate inflammation. Acute injuries trigger biological processes involving white blood cells, the production of fibrinogen, and the growth of adhesions. Adhesions also result from the other types of injuries.</p>
    <p>Cumulative injuries result from the law of repetitive motion and the cumulative injury cycle. The law of repetitive motion may be modeled as:</p>
    <p>
      <maths> <formula-text> <i>I=NF/AR, </i>  (1) </formula-text> </maths> </p>
    <p>wherein I is a relative quantity denoting an insult to the tissues; N is a number of repetitions; F is the force or tension of each repetition as a percent of maximum muscle strength; A is the amplitude of each repetition; and R is the relaxation time between each repetition. For example, a jackhammer operator is daily exposed to vibrations wherein N is high, A is low, and R is low. Thus, I is high. Formula (1) above shows that injuries may derive from constant pressure or tension that is without apparent or immediate trauma to soft tissues. Furthermore, cumulative injuries may result from isometric muscle contractions and poor posture with consequences including cellular calcium retention, poor cellular repair, and altered function.</p>
    <p>The Cumulative Injury Cycle</p>
    <p>The three basic injury types may all contribute to a cumulative injury cycle <b>100</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>1</b>. Repetitive motion injuries result in weak and tense tissues <b>102</b>. Tissues that are adjacent to these weak and tense tissues may also be drawn tight. Weak and tense tissues produce corresponding internal forces <b>104</b> including friction and pressure. An acute injury <b>106</b>, such as tearing or crushing on a microscopic or macroscopic level, can result from these internal forces. An isolated acute injury <b>106</b> can also commence cycle <b>100</b>. Inflammation <b>108</b> results from the acute injury <b>106</b>, and exacerbates the total problem by enhancing the weakness and tenseness of the injured tissues. Internal forces <b>104</b> also induce decreased circulation or edema <b>108</b>. The effect of these internal forces is usually a decrease in circulation. The acute injury <b>106</b> and inflammation <b>108</b> contribute to cellular hypoxia from restricted circulation. This cellular hypoxia causes fibrosis and adhesions <b>110</b> to occur in and between tissues. Acute injury <b>106</b> and inflammation <b>108</b> combine to form an inflammation cycle <b>112</b> leading to adhesion and fibrosis <b>110</b>. A chronic cycle <b>114</b> also leads towards adhesion and fibrosis <b>110</b>. Chronic cycle <b>114</b> includes the effects of decreased circulation and edema <b>116</b>. As indicated above, internal forces <b>104</b> lead to a decrease in circulation and an increase in internal pressure. The decrease in circulation may be enhanced by the continued application of external pressure, e.g., as from an elastic garment. Pressure applied over a low-pressure lymphatic channel causes swelling or edema, which also leads to adhesion and fibrosis <b>110</b>.</p>
    <p>Certain persons are predisposed to be more affected than others by injuries on the cumulative injury cycle <b>100</b>. For example, smokers and diabetics have relatively poor circulation, which helps perpetuate the cycle. Thyroid deficits and hormonal changes increase musculature tension, and enhance the degree of weakness and tightness in the affected tissues.</p>
    <p>The cumulative injury cycle <b>100</b> perpetuates itself, and afflicted persons find themselves in a downward spiral until the symptoms and syndromes of cumulative injury disorder are prevalent. Examples of cumulative injury disorders include carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, epicondylitis, tenosynovitis, myofascitis, bursitis, peripheral nerve entrapment, thoracic outlet syndrome, De Quervain's disease, and others.</p>
    <p>Conventional Treatment Methodology</p>
    <p>Conventional training disposes those in the medical profession to a sequential protocol involving the treatment of patients, namely, history, evaluation, diagnosis and then treatment. The patient's history is taken to determine what symptoms the patient has experienced and for how long, what treatments have been applied, and what has been the effect of those treatments. In the evaluation stage, the patient may be subjected to testing that confirms symptoms or conditions that are to be expected in conjunction with respective diagnostic options. A diagnosis is made based upon the results of the history and evaluation stages. Only then is there adopted a treatment modality addressing the diagnosed problem.</p>
    <p>The conventional approach is problematic in the diagnosis and treatment of soft tissue disorders because the evaluation is often flawed due to the ad hoc level of expertise in the medical profession. The physician selects a particular treatment based upon this diagnosis; however, the treatment may be flawed because it neglects some of the affected areas. The physician may also be bombarded with conflicting or incomplete reports of existing treatment modalities. For example, stretching and bending of the forearm according to Feero in U.S. Pat. No. 5,501,657 does not affect all of the nerves noted by Leahy. In another example, a physical examination or evaluation designed to detect carpal tunnel syndrome may lead to a diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome because a physician expects to see this disorder and has conducted the physical examination to confirm it. Surgery may subsequently be performed to relieve pressure on the median nerve, but symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome may occur even when the median nerve is not compressed at the carpal tunnel.</p>
    <p>There remains a true need for an expert system in diagnosing and treating soft tissue lesions. The expert system would avoid misdiagnosis and provide non-surgical treatment modalities having a greater chance of success than that which surgical techniques offer.</p>
    <heading>Solution</heading> <p>The present invention overcomes the aforementioned problems by providing an expert system for diagnosing and treating soft tissue lesions. Clinical experience has shown that the success rate in treating soft tissue adhesions according to the non-surgical protocols set forth below is approximately ninety four percent. This phenomenal success rate far exceeds that which is obtainable from surgical methods and exists, in part, because the expert system works in a nontraditional manner permitting health care providers to implement a treatment that combines diagnosis and evaluation. The expert system avoids the traditional need for diagnosis and evaluation prior to beginning treatment by mapping visual images of symptom patterns to specially designed treatment protocols. This new method of beginning treatment prior to diagnosis and evaluation is very different from prior treatment methods, which follow the sequential steps of history, evaluation, diagnosis, and then treatment.</p>
    <p>The broadest concept of the invention includes an expert system for medical practitioners to use in the non-surgical treatment of soft tissue lesions. The medical practitioner and a patient study a plurality of indicia representing symptom pattern images or charts. Each symptom pattern image provides an association between an anatomical image showing a portion of the human body and an expert-derived symptom pattern that is superposed on the anatomical image. The expert-derived symptom pattern depicts an anatomical area where a medical expert has determined that soft tissue lesions produce symptoms, such as numbness, tingling, pain, ache, burning, weakness, atrophy, circulatory changes, hypersensitivity, restricted motion, and combinations of these symptoms. An identifier is used to associate each of the respective symptom pattern images with one or more corresponding expert treatment protocols. Both the symptom pattern images and the treatment protocols include a cross-reference list of related treatment protocols. This cross-reference list is useful because very different soft tissue lesions may produce similar or identical symptoms. Thus, an effective treatment may be implemented from a battery of diagrams without a confirmed diagnosis ever having been made.</p>
    <p>The expert system avoids problems that are inherent to traditional medical treatment methods because it permits treatment to begin even before the medical practitioner has made a diagnosis or completed an evaluation. A patient is interviewed to identify the anatomical area or areas on his or her person where the patient is experiencing the symptoms from the list of symptoms identified above, e.g., numbness or tingling sensations. This anatomical area is referred to herein as the patient's symptom pattern. The locus of the patient's symptom pattern is matched with a selected symptom pattern image. The selected symptom pattern image is selected from a plurality of such images, which may be displayed to the patient from a book, computer database, or wall chart. Thus, matching of the patient's symptom pattern with a symptom pattern image preferably occurs by asking the patient to select a symptom pattern chart that shows an expert-derived symptom pattern corresponding to the locus of the patient's symptoms. The medical practitioner who implements the treatment may assist the patient's selection of an appropriate symptom pattern chart by suggesting selected symptom pattern charts and recalling them from storage to present them for the patient's review.</p>
    <p>The selected symptom pattern chart is preferably associated by an identifier with one or more expert treatment protocols. For example, this identifier can be the number of a corresponding expert treatment protocol, and the number can be found as indicia on the symptom pattern chart. The expert treatment protocol is used to diagnose and treat a soft tissue lesion in the patient. If the selected treatment fails to reproduce the symptoms that the patient has been experiencing or the medical practitioner cannot feel the adhesion in the correct spot, then another treatment protocol may be selected and implemented from the cross-reference list of related treatment protocols. The shared identifier is used to match the symptom pattern image with an a corresponding treatment protocol for appropriate recall on demand whether the symptom pattern images are found in a book, computer image database, or chart.</p>
    <p>As indicated above, the treatment protocols include specific techniques for manually manipulating the patient's body to effect treatment of the patient's soft tissue lesions. This manual manipulation occurs proximate the locus of the expert-derived symptom pattern and the patient's symptom pattern as directed by the expert treatment protocol. It is essential to the high success rate of the expert system treatment that the manual manipulation of the patient's body include moving the patient's symptom pattern area while holding a portion of the patient's anatomy including the patient's symptom pattern area in tension at a contact point. This movement under tension causes soft tissues underlying the contact point to pass longitudinally beneath the contact point with respect to fibers in the tissues. This movement is preferably done actively by the patient, but may also be done passively by the medical practitioner if the patient is incapable or does not want to perform the motion. The expert treatment protocols facilitate this manipulation by providing an anatomical diagram showing the location of subcutaneous tissues involved in active motion.</p>
    <p>Use of the expert system permits medical practitioners to implement treatment before they have conducted an evaluation and diagnosis. The medical practitioner confirms an expert diagnosis found in the expert treatment protocol by feeling for the presence of a soft tissue lesion during the prescribed treatment. The diagnosis is further confirmed if he or she can reproduce the soft tissue adhesion symptoms during treatment. Thus, the treatment can be selected and its application can be started without the medical practitioner ever having to perform an evaluation and diagnosis; the treatment becomes the evaluation. This aspect of using the expert system avoids misdiagnosis with the associated consequence of improperly administered treatments.</p>
    <p>Apparatus for use in connection with this treatment includes means for storing the symptom pattern charts and for associating each of the charts with one or more corresponding expert treatment protocols. This associating means preferably includes an identifier, e.g., a number, that is shared between the respective symptom pattern charts their corresponding expert treatment protocols. This apparatus can be in the form of a computer database that performs or assists in the function of displaying a selected treatment protocol for use, or it can be in the form of a book including cross indexed symptom pattern charts and treatment protocols.</p>
    <p>The apparatus is especially useful as an aid in training others to treat patients according to the claimed invention. Medical practitioners can learn to use method and apparatus according to the invention in seminars or classes where actual or simulated patients are treated or through the use of visual displays, e.g., overhead transparencies, computer displays, or audio visual presentations, showing pictures of actual or simulated treatment in progress.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading> <p>Introductory Principles of Longitudinal Manipulation of Soft Tissues</p>
    <p>The expert system of the present invention is designed to provide non-surgical treatments for soft tissue lesions or adhesions. Thus, the treatment can eliminate or reduce the size of soft tissue adhesions that cause symptoms including numbness, tingling, pain, ache, burning, weakness, atrophy, circulatory changes, hypersensitivity, and restricted motion. The treatment also alleviates or eliminates these symptoms.</p>
    <p>A key principle of the invention is that soft tissue adhesions can be treated by longitudinal manipulation of soft tissues in cooperation with active or passive motion of the patient's body. Active patient motion is most preferred. It is most desirable to implement treatment by manually contacting the exterior skin of a patient at a contact point that is selected to place subcutaneous tissues of a patient in tension. The subcutaneous tissues include muscles, nerves, ligaments, or tendons. The patient is then moved or moves to slide the subcutaneous tissues longitudinally beneath the contact point. This technique is distinct from traditional massage techniques, which typically do not require patient motion and also move laterally, as opposed to longitudinally, across the respective muscles, nerves, ligaments, or tendons. Thus, the techniques described herein are referred to as manipulation, not massage. The working examples set forth below provide numerous implementations of this soft tissue manipulation technique including longitudinal sliding motion under tension beneath a contact point.</p>
    <p>FIG. 2 demonstrates these principles of soft tissue manipulation in action on an extensor carpi ulnaris <b>200</b>, which includes muscles <b>202</b> and tendons <b>204</b> located beneath the skin on the posterior portion of the wrist. A normal extensor carpi ulnaris <b>200</b> is normally used to extend the wrist, but in this case motion is restricted because a cumulative injury disorder has caused the growth of an adhesion <b>206</b> binding extensor carpi ulnaris <b>200</b> with synovial sheath <b>208</b> and extensor retinaculum <b>210</b>. Extensor carpi ulnaris <b>200</b> presents a longitudinal axis <b>212</b>. Contractions of muscles in extensor carpi ulnaris <b>200</b> naturally cause a shortening of extensor carpi ulnaris <b>200</b> along longitudinal axis <b>212</b>. The interior structure of extensor carpi ulnaris <b>200</b> includes a plurality of fibers (not depicted) each having a substantially parallel orientation with respect to longitudinal axis <b>212</b>. A medical practitioner is exerting external pressure P at contact point <b>214</b> on the posterior surface of the wrist.</p>
    <p>The patient is asked to raise his or her wrist and fingers. The patient, accordingly, contracts muscles <b>202</b> to shorten extensor carpi ulnaris <b>200</b>. Similarly, the patient is asked to lower his or her little finger and responsively contracts other muscles causing adhesion <b>214</b> to slide in longitudinal motion beneath contact point <b>214</b> in the direction of arrow <b>218</b>. In this second motion, the extensor carpi ulnaris <b>200</b> is placed in tension by the pressure P at contact point <b>206</b>. The medical practitioner may passively provide this motion if the patient is unable to do so, but it is preferred for that the patient provide active or voluntary motion whenever possible.</p>
    <p>The above discussion referencing FIG. 2 describes what should be done during soft tissue manipulation techniques according to the present invention. In a preferred sense, it is also important that other manipulations not be performed. It is most preferred that the soft tissue manipulation techniques are conducted essentially without lateral motion across the longitudinal axis <b>212</b>, i.e., avoiding manipulation in the directions of double-headed arrow <b>220</b>. Furthermore, it is preferred to maintain steady pressure P at contact point <b>214</b> and let the patient do essentially all of the movement. Thus, it is preferred that the medical practitioner remain still while exerting pressure P so as not to perform longitudinal sliding motion along longitudinal axis <b>212</b>. The medical practitioner may also slide contact point <b>214</b> along axis <b>212</b>, but it is necessary, in a preferred sense, that this sliding motion be conducted in a direction that is essentially parallel to axis <b>212</b>.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 3-5 depict an example of the soft tissue manipulation techniques of the present invention. FIG. 3 is an anatomical diagram of the subcutaneous tissues of the wrist including extensor tendons with retinaculum. A contact point or contact area <b>300</b> exists across the posterior wrist over the extensor retinaculum, synovial sheaths, and extensor carpi ulnaris, which are identified by corresponding indicia <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, and <b>306</b>. Extensor carpi ulnaris <b>200</b> (see also FIG. 2) is shown operably attached in relationship to other anatomical features.</p>
    <p>In FIG. 4, the hands <b>400</b>, <b>402</b> of a medical practitioner implementing treatment are placed over contact point <b>300</b> of a patient's wrist <b>404</b>. The patient has actively moved his wrist in an upward direction to provide sliding longitudinal motion beneath contact point <b>300</b> in the underlying extensor retinaculum, synovial sheaths, and extensor carpi ulnaris. This motion tensions the portions of the patient's extensor retinaculum, synovial sheaths, and extensor carpi ulnaris, between the patient's elbow and contact point <b>300</b>. Similarly, FIG. 5 depicts the patient;'s wrist after downward motion in the direction of arrow <b>500</b>. This downward motion tensions the portions of the patient's extensor retinaculum, synovial sheaths, and extensor carpi ulnaris, between the patient's fingers and contact point <b>300</b>.</p>
    <p>In a typical treatment session, the up and down motions of FIGS. 4 and 5 are repeated from three to eight times to induce corresponding longitudinal sliding motion in the subcutaneous tissues. Analogous contact points for the inducement of similar longitudinal sliding motions exist for virtually every soft tissue in the human or animal body. Repetitions are adjusted as needed to assure patient comfort, and are stopped when the patient experiences undue discomfort or pain. Nevertheless, it is to be expected that the patient will experience a small amount of discomfort when undergoing these repetitions.</p>
    <p>Overview of the treatment process</p>
    <p>FIG. 6 depicts a generalized diagram of process P<b>600</b> for use in treating patients according to the present invention. A significant advantage of process P<b>600</b> is that it does not require surgery. Soft tissues are manipulated from outside the body to provide therapeutic benefit. Depending upon the needs of individual patients, process P<b>600</b> can also be used in combination with surgery; however, the surgery falls outside the scope of and is considered distinct from the present invention.</p>
    <p>Step P<b>602</b> includes displaying a plurality of symptom pattern images, such as symptom pattern images <b>700</b>, <b>702</b>, and <b>704</b> shown in FIG. <b>7</b>. These symptom pattern images and other symptom pattern images are displayed to a patient in need of treatment. At the same time as the symptom pattern images are being displayed to the patient, they are also preferably displayed to a practitioner who will implement treatment. Thus, the medical practitioner can suggest appropriate symptom pattern images to the patient. Suitable means for displaying these images include a book, photographic slide projector or, preferably, a computerized image storage and retrieval system driven by conventional object-oriented code.</p>
    <p>In FIG. 7, each symptom pattern image <b>700</b>, <b>702</b>, and <b>704</b> includes a corresponding anatomical base image <b>706</b>, <b>708</b>, or <b>710</b>, depicting an exterior view of the anterior shoulder in a male patient. An identifier <b>712</b>, <b>714</b>, or <b>716</b> is associated with each symptom pattern image. The identifier functions as a means for associating a selected symptom pattern image with a corresponding treatment protocol (not depicted in FIG. <b>7</b>). As in the case of symptom pattern image <b>718</b>, a single symptom pattern image may be associated with a plurality of identifiers corresponding to a plurality of treatment protocols in a relationship comprising one image to many protocols. A darkened area representing a corresponding expert-derived symptom pattern <b>722</b>, <b>724</b>, or <b>726</b>, is superposed on each anatomical base image. The respective expert-derived symptom patterns <b>722</b>, <b>724</b>, and <b>726</b>, each cover different localized anatomical areas with respect to the underlying base anatomical image. For example, expert-derived symptom pattern <b>722</b> is located on the neck of anatomical image <b>700</b>, while symptom pattern <b>726</b> is located on the chest of anatomical image <b>704</b>. Similarly, expert-derived symptom pattern <b>724</b> occupies a smaller area than does expert-derived symptom pattern <b>726</b>.</p>
    <p>The locations of the expert-derived symptom patterns <b>722</b>, <b>724</b>, and <b>726</b> are selected by medical practitioners who have extensive experience in diagnosing and treating soft tissue lesions or adhesions. The symptom patterns identify the respective locations of symptoms including numbness, tingling, pain, ache, burning, weakness, atrophy, circulatory changes, hypersensitivity, restricted motion, and combinations of these symptoms, which are associated with specific types of soft tissue lesions. Expert medical practitioners who are qualified to identify the location of these symptom patterns include medical doctors, chiropractors, and others who are involved in treating soft tissue lesions.</p>
    <p>Returning now to FIG. 6, step P<b>604</b> includes selecting a symptom pattern image having an expert-derived symptom pattern that most closely covers or resembles the areal extent of symptoms that the patient is experiencing. Ultimately, the patient has to decide which symptom pattern image best corresponds to his or her symptoms. It is recommended that the medical practitioner who intends to implement treatment suggest various symptom pattern images for the patient to review, in order to facilitate the patient making the best selection.</p>
    <p>Step P<b>606</b> includes associating the symptom pattern image with a corresponding treatment protocol. This association is made by use of the identifiers <b>712</b>, <b>714</b>, <b>716</b>, and <b>720</b> (see FIG. <b>7</b>), which correspond to the selected symptom pattern image. For example, symptom pattern image <b>700</b> is associated with an identifier indicia <b>712</b> comprising the number ‘68.’</p>
    <p>FIG. 8 depicts a treatment protocol <b>800</b>, which is associated with symptom pattern image <b>700</b> of FIG. 7 because it shares the identifier <b>712</b> comprising the number ‘68.’ As shown in FIG. 8, treatment protocol <b>800</b> includes everything that a skilled medical practitioner requires to implement treatment for soft tissue lesions in the scalenes, according to the longitudinal soft tissue manipulation principles described in FIGS. 2-5. Treatment protocol <b>800</b> includes a title <b>802</b> providing a general location of the anatomical area where treatment is to be implemented, and a Symptom Patterns section <b>804</b> describing the nature of the symptoms involved. Where the symptom pattern image is associated with many identifiers, it is recommended that the medical practitioner read the Symptom pattern section <b>804</b> before implementing treatment. It is possible that one or more treatment protocols may be eliminated if the Symptom Pattern <b>804</b> description does not correspond to the patient's symptoms.</p>
    <p>Treatment protocol <b>800</b> also includes a Functional Anatomy section <b>806</b> describing in greater detail the anatomical location of the soft tissues where treatment is to be implemented, suggested methods for working or manipulating the anatomical location, a diagnosis <b>808</b> corresponding to the selected symptom pattern image <b>700</b>, and a cross-reference list <b>810</b> of related treatment protocols. Treatment protocol <b>800</b> also includes Treatment section <b>812</b>, which provides additional detail with respect to how treatment should be implemented. Subsections of Treatment section <b>812</b> include a Contact subsection <b>814</b> describing the parts of the provider's hand used to contact the patient. A Pressure Tension subsection <b>816</b> provides a relative index of how much pressure and tension are required to effect treatment at the contact point. A Contact Motion subsection <b>818</b> describes what type of internal and external motion should be associated with manipulation of the patient at the contact point. A Patient Motion subsection <b>820</b> describes whether the patient should move actively or passively. An Instructions subsection <b>822</b> provides details of how the medical practitioner should manipulate the patient. A Notes subsection <b>824</b> provides special comments and considerations to assure that treatment is being properly implemented.</p>
    <p>FIG. 9 depicts additional preferred aspects of treatment protocol <b>800</b> including sequentially accessed illustrations <b>900</b> of the treatment protocol <b>800</b> being implemented on an actual patient. These illustrations <b>900</b> include anatomical diagram <b>901</b> which, in the case of treatment protocol <b>800</b> corresponding to identifier <b>712</b> depicts an anterior view of the scalenes <b>902</b> annotated with informational indicia <b>903</b>. Furthermore, a series of photographs <b>904</b>, <b>906</b>, <b>908</b>, and <b>910</b>, depict the implementation of treatment subsection <b>812</b> (see FIG. <b>8</b>). Photograph <b>904</b> shows the left hand <b>912</b> of a medical practitioner with the thumb <b>916</b> exerting low tension and low compression over contact point <b>916</b> on patient <b>918</b>. Photograph <b>906</b> shows the head <b>920</b> of patient <b>918</b> being passively moved towards the right hand side of patient <b>918</b> by the action of the medical practitioner's right hand <b>922</b>. This motion of head <b>920</b> internally slides the scalenes <b>903</b> in longitudinal tensile motion beneath contact point <b>916</b>.</p>
    <p>Photographs <b>908</b> and <b>910</b> show an alternative treatment modality in which the medical practitioner's middle finger <b>924</b> and index finger <b>926</b> are placed on contact point <b>916</b> to effect a treatment that is, otherwise, substantially identical to that shown in photographs <b>904</b> and <b>906</b>. The provision of anatomical diagram <b>902</b> together with photographs <b>904</b>-<b>910</b> improves treatment by providing the medical practitioner who implements treatment with a better understanding of the longitudinal orientation of the muscle groups being treated. Thus, the medical practitioner is better able to select a contact point <b>916</b> to suit the anatomy of a given patient.</p>
    <p>Returning now to FIG. 6, step P<b>608</b> includes consulting the selected treatment protocol (e.g., protocol <b>800</b>) and manipulating soft tissues of the patient to implement treatment in accord with the selected protocol. Simultaneously with implementation of the treatment protocol, in step P<b>610</b>, the medical practitioner feels for altered tension, texture and movement that constitute soft tissue lesions in the symptom pattern area being treated beneath the contact point. The medical practitioner makes the diagnosis by actually feeling the adhesion. This diagnosis should correspond to the expert diagnosis mentioned in the treatment protocol, e.g., diagnosis <b>808</b> of FIG. <b>8</b>. It is not necessary that there be actual correspondence or confirmation of the expert diagnosis; however, it is recommended to seek other available treatment protocols if the lesion cannot be confirmed where expected by feel, especially if alleviation of the patient's symptoms does not progress.</p>
    <p>In step P<b>612</b>, the medical practitioner confirms the diagnosis by interviewing the patient to determine whether the selected treatment protocol has reproduced the symptoms of numbness, tingling, pain, ache, burning, weakness, atrophy, circulatory changes, hypersensitivity, or restricted motion, that the patient has been experiencing. The treatment should reproduce some or all of these symptoms.</p>
    <p>Step P<b>614</b> includes the use of related treatment protocols. It is often advisable for the medical practitioner to further treatment by the additional use of related treatment protocols, such as those mentioned in the Related Treatment Protocol section <b>810</b> of FIG. <b>8</b>. These separate protocols are optionally implemented by a repetition of steps P<b>608</b>-P<b>612</b> using the new modalities that are associated with each new protocol. The use of additional treatment protocols is strongly recommended when the medical practitioner has been unable, even after treatment, to make a diagnosis because the medical practitioner has been unable to feel a soft tissue lesion or adhesion. Other circumstances where it is recommended to consult additional treatment protocols include instances where the treatment has failed to reproduce symptoms of numbness, tingling, pain, ache, burning, weakness, atrophy, circulatory changes, hypersensitivity, or restricted motion in the patient.</p>
    <p>Step P<b>616</b> includes repeating treatment of the patient at successive time intervals. These time intervals are preferably two or more days apart. Noticeable improvement is often apparent after the very first treatment session. Treatments are concluded at step P<b>618</b> when, in the judgment of the medical practitioner and the patient, the patient's symptoms have improved sufficiently to justify cessation of treatment. Treatments are most preferably stopped when the patient is experiencing no more symptoms, and the medical practitioner can no longer feel the soft tissue lesion or adhesion.</p>
    <p>Working Examples</p>
    <p>The following non-limiting examples set forth preferred materials and methods for use in practicing the present invention. These examples are representative portions of a larger database of treatment modalities found in the accompanying Microfiche Appendix, which provides a comprehensive program for soft tissues of the upper extremity. These working examples show numerous applications of the principles of soft tissue manipulation seeking therapeutic benefit from longitudinal sliding motions under tension beneath as contact point, as described above with respect to FIGS. 2-5.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE 1</heading> <heading>Treatment of the Hand Adhesions in the Palmar Fascia</heading> <p>Adhesions of the palmar fascia can cause contractures, such as those which result from Dupuytren's contracture (a fibrosis of the palmar fascia). FIG. 10 depicts a plurality of symptom pattern images, e.g., images <b>1000</b> and <b>1002</b>, including darkened areas comprising expert-derived symptom patterns superposed on base anatomical images of the anterior hand. These symptom pattern images and others are displayed to a patient who complains about a restricted range of hand motion. A patient having Dupuytren's contracture would most likely select symptom pattern image <b>1000</b>, which includes indicia <b>1004</b> associating symptom pattern image <b>1000</b> with treatment protocols ‘4, 6 and 8.’</p>
    <p>The medical practitioner who administers treatment optionally selects treatment protocol 8 as the first treatment protocol to be administered. FIGS. 11 and 12 depict treatment protocol 8. The features of FIG. 11 are numbered in like manner with respect to features that are described above with respect to FIG. 8, except the features of FIG. 11 are provided with an “a” postscript to show that the corresponding indicia to which the features of FIG. 11 apply have been adapted to provide a treatment protocol for adhesions of the palmar fascia.</p>
    <p>FIG. 12 depicts indicia <b>1200</b> including an anatomical image <b>1201</b>, as well as two photographs <b>1202</b> and <b>1204</b> showing soft tissue manipulation techniques for the features of anatomical image <b>1201</b>. Anatomical image <b>1201</b> shows an anterior view of the palmar fascia with annotations <b>1206</b> and <b>1208</b> indicating the locations and longitudinal orientation of the superficial transverse metacarpal ligament and the transverse fasciculi.</p>
    <p>Photographs <b>1202</b> and <b>1204</b> show the implementation of treatment protocol <b>812</b> <i>a </i>(see FIG. <b>11</b>). In photograph <b>1202</b>, a medical practitioner's left hand <b>1210</b> is grasping the flexed fingers of a patient's hand <b>1212</b>. Fingers of the medical practitioner's right hand <b>1214</b> are contacting the patient's palm to provide contact point <b>1216</b> at the back of the wrist above the palmar fascia shown in anatomical diagram <b>1201</b>. The medical practitioner exerts passive motion on the patient's hand to extend the patient's fingers to the position shown in photograph <b>1204</b>. The extension is done slowly over about five or more seconds. Tension on the palmar fascia is forced by the medical practitioner placing his or her thenar pads on the back of the wrist below the thumb.</p>
    <p>The contact point <b>1216</b> described herein is preferably stationary, but if the practitioner feels extensive adhesions running the length of the superficial transverse metacarpal ligament, it is recommended to use a sliding contact during extension. This sliding contact runs in the direction of arrow <b>1218</b> from the knuckles towards the position of hand <b>1214</b> shown in photograph <b>1204</b>. If median-nerve compression symptoms of numbness and tingling are duplicated, the medical practitioner stops treatment and begins again with a new grip att the back of the wrist with slightly less tension.</p>
    <p>Patients usually experience significant improvements in just three or four visits spaced two days apart.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE 2</heading> <heading>Treatment of the Wrist Adhesions of the Transverse Carpal Ligament</heading> <p>FIG. 10 shows symptom pattern image <b>1006</b> associated with indicator indicia <b>1008</b> referencing treatment protocols ‘3 and 19.’ These treatment protocols are most likely to be selected by a patient having carpal tunnel symptoms brought on by carpal ligament entrapment of the median nerve. FIGS. 13 and 14 depict a treatment protocol ‘19’ corresponding to indicator indicia <b>1008</b>. The features of FIG. 13 are numbered in like manner with respect to features that are described above with respect to FIG. 8, except the features of FIG. 13 are provided with a “b” postscript to show that the corresponding indicia to which the features of FIG. 13 apply have been adapted to provide a treatment protocol for adhesions involving the carpal ligament.</p>
    <p>FIG. 14 depicts indicia <b>1400</b> including an anatomical image <b>1401</b>, as well as two photographs <b>1402</b> and <b>1404</b> showing soft tissue manipulation techniques for the features of anatomical image <b>1401</b>. Anatomical image <b>1401</b> shows an anterior view of the transverse carpal ligament with annotations <b>1406</b>, <b>1408</b>, <b>1410</b>, and <b>1412</b> indicating the respective locations and longitudinal orientations of the transverse carpal ligament, thenar muscles, pisiform, and hypothenar muscles.</p>
    <p>Photograph <b>1402</b> shows a patient's wrist <b>1412</b> in a neutral position. This neutral wrist position is maintained throughout treatment. The medical practitioner's hands <b>1414</b> and <b>1416</b> are placed with their respective thenar pads at the back of the patient's wrist <b>1412</b> to exert contact at each end of the transverse carpal ligament. Hand <b>1416</b> grasps the patient's thumb. The medical practitioner's thenar pads are used as levers to exert as much tension as the patient permits at contact points <b>1418</b> and <b>1420</b>. Photograph <b>1404</b> shows the ensuing extension motion with the fingers of hand <b>1414</b> contacting the area above the transverse carpal ligament and holding the same in tension with the posterior motion of the patient's thumb in hand <b>1416</b>. This motion produces an internal stretch/sliding motion of the transverse carpal ligament, which is tensioned beneath contact points <b>1418</b> and <b>1420</b>.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE 3</heading> <heading>Treatment of the Shoulder Adhesions of the Subscapularis</heading> <p>FIG. 7 shows symptom pattern image <b>718</b> and indicator indicia <b>720</b> referencing treatment protocols ‘48, 50, 51, 52, 54, 56, and 65.’ Symptom pattern image <b>718</b> is most likely to be selected by people who routinely exert heavy pushing motions and competitive swimmers having instability of the rotator cuff and impingement syndrome.

    <p>Photograph <b>1902</b> shows a prone patient <b>1916</b>. The patient's humerus <b>1922</b> is aducted. A medical practitioner's hands <b>1918</b> and <b>1920</b> are grasping the patient's shoulder to place the practitioner's thumbs in over contact point <b>1924</b>, which lies just over the inferior edge of the patient's posterior deltoid. The contact point is moved as much as possible towards the teres minor, in order to draw tension medially. In photograph <b>1904</b>, the patient has moved humerus <b>1922</b> to reach overhead, also in order to draw tension medially. This motion induces longitudinal sliding motion of the deltoid under tension beneath contact point <b>1924</b>.</p>
    <p>Photograph <b>1906</b> shows a supine patient <b>1916</b> who is about to undergo treatment of the infraspinatus under deltoid after the procedures of photographs <b>1902</b> and <b>1904</b> have been performed about three to five times. The patient's humerus <b>1922</b> is flexed forward and externally rotated in an upwards direction. The medical practitioner's thumb is placed on contact point <b>1926</b> over the patient's deltoid at a location just anterior to the infraspinatus to traction the deltoid posterior along the fibers of the infraspinatus. The patient is requested to actively rotate the humerus between upward and downward positions. Photograph <b>1908</b> shows rotation to a downward position.</p>

    <p>Photograph <b>2202</b> shows a supine patient <b>2210</b>. A medical practitioner's hand <b>2212</b> is grasping the patient's humerus <b>2214</b> to slightly abduct humerus <b>2214</b> to an extended side position that relieves tension on the patient's subscapularis with the patient's elbow bent ninety degrees or more. The thumb of medical practitioner's hand <b>2216</b> has palpitated past the latissimus dorsi and teres major to the anterior surface of the scapula of patient <b>2210</b>, then moved superior to the brachial chords. Hand <b>2216</b> provides a contact point <b>2218</b> inferior to the lesion by grasping as shown in photograph <b>2202</b>. This grasping motion draws the skin and lose tissue of patient <b>2210</b> to a point between the muscle and nerve tissue and exerts tension along the nerve/muscle junction. Photograph <b>2204</b> shows the position of patient <b>2210</b> after abduction of the humerus <b>2214</b> to an overhead position with the elbow <b>2220</b> of patient <b>2210</b> placed in as far a posterior position as the patient will allow. During abduction of the humerus <b>2214</b>, it is preferred to maintain contact point <b>2218</b> in a stationary position until the medical practitioner feels tension developing beneath contact point <b>2218</b>. After this tension develops, it is preferred that the medical practitioner slide hand <b>2216</b> and contact point <b>2218</b> in the downward direction of arrow <b>2222</b> to optimize tension. This motion produces longitudinal sliding motion of the neurovascular sleeve and brachial chords beneath contact point <b>2218</b>.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE 6</heading> <heading>Treatment of the Shoulder Adhesions of the Dorsal Scapular Nerve at the Serratus Posterior Superior</heading> <p>FIG. 23 shows a plurality of nerve symptom pattern images <b>2300</b> including symptom pattern image <b>2302</b> showing that the patient's central back is affected by pain, numbness or tingling sensations.

    <p>Photograph <b>2502</b> shows a supine patient <b>2510</b> with neck <b>2512</b> inclined laterally toward the left, i.e., toward the side where symptoms are felt. The patient's humerus <b>2514</b> is abducted <b>900</b>. A medical practitioner's hand <b>2516</b> is grasping patient <b>2512</b> at a contact point <b>2518</b> over the patient's levator scapulae muscles. Tension is drawn at the contact point by tractioning hand <b>2512</b> and contact point <b>2516</b> inferiorly along the side of the patient's spinous processes until the medical practitioner feels an adhesion in the serratus posterior superior muscle. As shown in photograph <b>2504</b>, patient <b>2510</b> is then requested to move humerus in a motion as though the patent is reaching for the opposite (right) hip. At the same time, the medical practitioner draws contact point <b>2518</b> and hand <b>2512</b> laterally along the serratus posterior superior muscle. Hand <b>2520</b> passively moves the patient's head to the right as shown in photograph <b>2504</b>. These movements pull on the patient's rhomboid muscle. The patient is requested to slow down the last twelve inches of arm motion towards the opposite hip because the serratus muscle tension increases rapidly in this range of motion. This last twelve inches of motion is also the range in which the treatment is most likely to duplicate the patient's symptoms. The motion is made with high tension and low compression provided beneath contact point <b>2518</b> by the fingers and thumb of hand <b>2512</b>. The motion causes simultaneous longitudinal sliding motion under tension of the dorsal scapular nerve and the serratus posterior superior muscle with respect to contact point <b>2518</b>.</p>

The patient is requested to slowly extend the elbow and supinate to the position shown in photograph <b>2706</b>. The medical practitioner feels for the median nerve in the area shown as contact point <b>2728</b> in photograph <b>2706</b> where the pronator teres separates into an ulnar head and a humeral head. The patient's bending motion produces high tension and low compression beneath contact points <b>2718</b>. The elbow is then pronated and bent to the position of photograph <b>2704</b>, and the motion to the position of photograph <b>2706</b> is repeated. it is recommended that the first few passes be made with passive motion on the patient;'s part because it is difficult for the patient to learn the correct motion between photographs <b>2704</b> and <b>2706</b>. The motion causes tensile longitudinal sliding motion of the median nerve and pronator teres with respect to contact point <b>2718</b>.</p>

Medical practitioner's thumbs <b>3318</b> and <b>3320</b> are placed one over the other to provide contact point <b>3322</b> on either side of the ulnar nerve at the proximal limit of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. Contact point <b>3322</b> and thumbs <b>3318</b> and <b>3320</b> are moved from proximal to distal while the patient extends wrist <b>3324</b> and flexes elbow <b>3316</b> to the position shown in photograph <b>3304</b>. The patient's movement internally causes a longitudinal sliding motion of the ulnar nerve and the flexor carpi ulnaris with respect to contact point <b>3322</b>. The movement of contact pont <b>3322</b> also occurs longitudinally with respect to the ulnar nerve and the flexor carpi ulnaris.</p>
    <p>Photographs <b>3306</b> and <b>3308</b> show an alternative way of accomplishing the same longitudinal sliding motions produced by the contact and motions of photographs <b>3302</b> and <b>3304</b>. Photograph <b>3306</b> shows the medical practitioner's fingers <b>3326</b> positioned to provide contact point <b>3326</b> and medical practitioner's hand <b>3328</b> positioned to assist flexion of patient's wrist <b>3324</b>. The method of photographs <b>3306</b> and <b>3308</b> are better suited to passive flexion of elbow <b>3316</b>, while the method of photographs <b>3302</b> and <b>3304</b> is better suited to active motion by patient <b>3314</b>.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE 11</heading> <heading>Results on Actual Patients</heading> <p>An expert medical practitioner diagnosed soft tissue adhesions in a total of 447 patients. The expert medical practitioner consulted anatomical diagrams to determine the best manner of performing the longitudinal massage techniques described with reference to FIG. 2 on each type of adhesion. The massage techniques significantly improved the symptoms of pain, burning, and tingling in fully 418 or 93.5% of these patients. The treatment protocols failed to produce significant improvement in 29 or 6.5% of these patients. An additional 10 patients were examined who required different therapy because their symptoms could not be treated with the massage techniques. An additional 18 patients could not be helped because they refused to comply with requests for them to assist with active motion in therapy.</p>
    <p>The 418 successful treatments required an average of 6.2 office visits spaced at least two days apart. The 29 unsuccessful treatments required an average of 6.0 treatments before it was concluded that the treatments would not produce success. There appears to be no statistical significance based upon the treatment modality that was selected for use. That is, the statistics given above apply equally well to all treatment modalities or treatment protocols.</p>
