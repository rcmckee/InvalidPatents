The sulfur atom in the cephem ring may be oxido-type. The carboxyl group at 4-position of the cephem ring may be free type, or salts with nontoxic cation such as sodium, potassium or the like; a basic amino acid such as arginine, ornithine, lysine, histidine or the like; or a polyhydroxyalkylamine such as N-methylglucamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, trishydroxymethylaminomethane or the like.

    <p>Thus, the preferable examples of the present cephem compounds [I] may be the compounds that the group --CH<sub>2</sub> R<sup>4</sup> means methyl, acetoxymethyl, (1-methyl-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl, (1,2,3-triazol-5-yl)thiomethyl, (2-methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-5-yl)thiomethyl, etc. These compounds [I] are all novel and useful as antibiotics. Like the known cephalosporins or penicillins, the contemplated compounds [I] of this invention can each be administered in the forms of injection, capsules, tablets, granules, solutions, suspensions, solid forms, if necessary, with a physiologically acceptable carrier or excipient in accordance with the established pharmaceutical procedure. The contemplated compounds of this invention, such as sodium 7α-methoxy-7β-(2-aminothiazol-4-ylglycylamido)-3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-ylthiomethyl)-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid may be injected intramuscularly at a daily dose level of about 5 to 20 mg./kg. human body weight in 3 to 4 divided dose per day and are effective against respiratory-organ infections, urinary-tract infections, etc. And, the compounds [I] show strong antibiotic properties against a wide variety of microorganisms including gram-positive or negative bacteria, even by oral administration.</p>
    <p>The cephem compounds [I] of the present invention can be prepared by e.g. the following processes:</p>
    <p>(a) Reaction of Compounds [V] and [VI]</p>
    <p>The carboxyl group of the starting compounds [VI] of this reaction may be used as a salt form with alkali metals, organic amines such as sodium, potassium, triethylamine, etc., or as an ester form which can be easily converted into free carboxyl group by mild treatment with an acid or alkali, or by reduction, the ester being exemplified by e.g. with β-methylsulfonyl ethyl, trimethylsilyl, dimethylsilenyl, benzhydryl, β,β,β-trichloroethyl, phenacyl, p-methoxybenzyl, p-nitrobenzyl, methoxymethyl, etc. As the reactive derivatives of the other starting compounds [V], there may be employed acid halide, acid anhydride, mixed acid anhydride, cyclic carboxy-anhydride, active amide, ester, etc., thereof.</p>
    <p>This reaction can be conducted advantageously and smoothly in the presence of a solvent. As said solvent, use may be made of the common solvents and their mixtures unless such solvents do not interfere with the present reaction. There may be mentioned, therefore, such solvents as water, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, acetonitrile, chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethylene, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, dimethylsulfoxide, etc. This reaction may proceed more advantageously when to the solvent there is added a base such as pyridine, triethylamine, N,N-dimethylaniline, sodium hydrogen carbonate, etc. The quantity of the base to be added is 100-300%, desirably 100-200% of that of the starting compounds [V]. While the reaction temperature is virtually optional, the reaction usually is carried out under cooling or at room temperature. The reaction is generally completed within several minutes to several hours.</p>
    <p>If necessary, thus obtained compounds are subjected to removal of the protective group and/or conversion of the convertible group. The removal of the protective group of amino group may be conducted, for example, by acid treatment for t-butoxycarbonyl, etc., by a treatment with zinc and an acid for β,β,β-trichloroethoxycarbonyl, etc. by catalytic reduction for p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, etc. The protective groups of hydroxyl group are removed, for example, by potassium hydrogen carbonate in aqueous methanol for formyl or trifluoroacetyl, etc., by diluted hydrochloric acid treatment, for tetrahydropyranyl, etc., by zinc and an acid treatment for β,β,β-trichloroethoxycarbonyl, etc. The ester residues of the carboxylic acids are removed, for example, by acid treatment for benzhydryl, p-methoxybenzyl, etc., by alkali treatment for β-methylsulfonylethyl, etc., by aqueous treatment for trimethylsilyl, dimethylsilenyl, etc., by zinc--an acid treatment for β,β,β-trichloroethyl, etc., by reduction for p-nitrobenzyl, etc. The methylthio or methylseleno group etc. may be converted into methoxy group by e.g. reacting methanol in the presence of metal compounds including silver, mercury, lead, thallium, etc. The removal of the protective groups or the conversion of the groups may be performed at the same time if possible, or any of them may be removed or converted in accordance with the sort of the groups and/or the reaction condition of the next step.</p>
    <p>While the starting carboxylic acids [V] may occur as D- and L-isomers with respect to the α-carbon, whichever of these isomers, as well as their mixture, can be successfully employed for the purposes of this invention. It is known that generally, of cephalosporins or penicillins having a center of asymmetry at α-position, D-isomers are more antibiotic than the L-isomers.</p>
    <p>The compounds [V] employed as the starting materials in this reaction may be prepared by, e.g. the processes (6) to (9) mentioned above, and are used in that condition obtained by these processes or after removal of the protecting groups and/or conversion of the groups.</p>
    <p>The similar conditions as above are applied also to the reaction between the compounds [VI] and the compounds [IV].</p>
    <p>(b) Reduction of the Compounds [VII]</p>
    <p>In the starting compounds [VII], the symbols other than R<sup>5</sup> have the same meanings as defined above, and symbol R<sup>5</sup> means hydroxyl group which may be protected. As the protective groups of hydroxyl group, any of the conventional ones may be used so far as they do not disturb the reactions of this invention and there may be generally employed a lower alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, etc., an aryl group such as phenyl, thienyl, etc., an acyl group such as acetyl, benzoyl, etc.</p>
    <p>The reduction condition employed in the present reaction may be selected from the known reduction methods so far as the compounds [VII] can be reduced into the compounds [VIII], and preferable ones are the catalytic reduction employing catalysts such as Raney nickel, platinum oxide, palladium-carbon, ruthenium-carbon, rhodium-carbon, copper-chromium oxide, etc., reduction means employing nascent hydrogen obtained by the co-existence of metals such as sodium, sodium amalgam, aluminum amalgam etc. and water, alcohols, etc. reduction means employing metallic hydride complexes such as lithium aluminum hydride, diethyl aluminum hydride, sodium aluminum hydride, sodium borohydride, etc., reduction means treating with metals such as zinc, iron, etc. in solvents such as acetic anhydride, formic acid, or aqueous mixture thereof, etc., electroreduction, etc. The reaction conditions such as reaction temperature, pressure, sort of the solvents, reaction time, and others are selected suitably according to the sort of starting materials, reduction means, etc. After the reduction reaction, the reaction mixture may be, if necessary, subjected to removal reaction of the protective group directly or after separation of the objective compounds [VIII]. The removal of the protective group is conducted in accordance with the conventional removing methods employed for the removal of each protective group.</p>
    <p>(c) Reaction of the Compounds [IX] with a Nucleophilic Compounds</p>
    <p>In the compounds [IX], the symbol R<sup>6</sup> represents carbamoyloxy, an acyloxy such as acetyloxy, propionyloxy, 3-oxobutyryloxy, 3-carboxypropionyloxy, 2-carboxybenzoyloxy, 4-carboxybutyryloxy, mandelyloxy, 2-(carboethoxycarbamoyl)benzoyloxy, 2-(carboethoxysulfamoyl)benzoyloxy, 3-ethoxycarbamoylpropionyloxy, etc., a halogen such as bromine, chlorine, etc. and among them the acyloxy groups are generally employed. The nucleophilic compounds correspond to the compounds having the symbol R<sup>4</sup> of the compounds [I] mentioned above. Among the nucleophilic compounds, the mercapto compounds are reacted each in such forms as the free compound or a salt with an alkali metal such as sodium, potassium or the like. This reaction is desirably conducted in a solvent. For example, use can be made of water, heavy water or organic solvents readily miscible with water and inert to the starting compounds, such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, dioxane, acetone, alcohol, acetonitrile, dimethylsulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran, etc. The reaction temperature and time depend, among other factors, upon the starting compounds, solvent, etc. to be employed but generally the reaction is carried out at a selected temperature within the range of 0° to 100° C. for a selected time of a few hours to several days. The reaction is desirably conducted in the neighborhood of neutrality or between pH 2 and 8 and, for better results, between pH 5 and 8. The reaction often proceeds more smoothly by the addition of a quaternary ammonium salt having surface active effect (e.g. trimethylbenzylammonium bromide, triethylbenzylammonium bromide, triethylbenzylammonium hydroxide, etc.) to the reaction system. To prevent oxidation of the mercapto compounds, it is advantageous to carry out the reaction in an inert gaseous atmosphere, e.g. nitrogen gas.</p>
    <p>The cephem compounds [I] obtained by the processes illustrated hereinbefore, can be purified by such procedures as column chromatography, extraction, precipitation, recrystallization, etc. The compounds [I], if desired, are further converted to contemplated salt or ester, etc. by a per se known process.</p>
    <p>When R<sup>2</sup> represents a group of the formula; ═NR<sup>5</sup>, the compound [IX] may be represented by the formula; ##STR26## which may be reacted with nucleophilic compounds under a similar conditions mentioned above.</p>
    <p>Each starting compound employed in the above mentioned processes for preparing the cephem compounds [I] can be prepared for example by the following processes.</p>
    <p>(d) Reduction of the Compounds [IV]</p>
    <p>Similar reduction conditions as mentioned in above (b) are employed in this reaction. The carboxyl group of the starting compounds [IV] may be protected with a protective group removable under mild conditions which will not interfere with the thiazole ring, for example by acid or alkaline condition, reduction, etc. Therefore, such protective groups may be selected from those of carboxyl group generally employed in the peptide synthesis and are exemplified by alkali metals such as sodium, potassium, etc. alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, etc., substituted alkyl such as β-methylsulfonylethyl, trichloroethyl, diphenylmethyl, etc., aryl such as phenyl, tolyl, etc., substituted aryl such as p-tert-butylphenyl, p-nitrophenyl, etc., aralkyl such as benzyl, phenethyl, tolubenzyl, etc., substituted aralkyl such as p-methoxybenzyl, p-nitrobenzyl, etc. In the present reaction, it seems that the starting compound [IV] wherein R<sup>5</sup> is protected hydroxyl, gives better result. The contemplated compounds [V] may be purified by a per se known purification method such as solvent extraction, pH adjustment, crystallization, recrystallization, distillation, chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, etc. The isolated compound [V] is DL-mixture and may be resolved into D-form and L-form respectively by introducing it to suitable optical-active-crystal-forming salt, e.g. salt with tartaric acid, mandelic acid, malic acid, camphor-sulfonic acid, etc.</p>
    <p>(e) Reaction of the Compounds [XII] with [XIII]</p>
    <p>In the starting compounds [XII], the symbol X means halogen such as chlorine, bromine, iodine, fluorine, etc. When Y represents hydrogen, Z means amino group which may be protected, such group being exemplified above. Alternatively, Y and Z together represent a group of the formula; ═NR<sup>5</sup>, such group being also illustrated above. The carboxyl group of the compounds [XII] may be protected in a similar manner to that mentioned in respect of the compounds [IV]. In the present reaction, it is desirable to react substantially equivalent mole of both the starting compounds [XII] and [XIII]. The reaction is generally conducted in the solvent and such solvent may be selected from the organic solvent which will not disturb the contemplated reaction. Thus, methanol, ethanol, propanol, tetrahydrofuran, for example, are suitably employed. The reaction is carried out smoothly at room temperature or under reflux condition. The reaction is generally completed within one to several hours. The reaction may be carried out more smoothly by adding base such as dimethylaniline triethylamine, etc. to the reaction system. After the reaction is completed, the removal of the protecting group may be conducted directly to the reaction mixture or after isolation of the compounds [XIV], if desired. The purification of the compounds [XIV] may be carried out by the similar means as mentioned above (d). When the starting compounds [XIII] wherein R<sup>12</sup> represents a lower alkoxy group are employed, there is obtained a contemplated compound [XIV] wherein R<sup>1</sup> is hydroxyl according to the present reaction.</p>
    <p>(f) Diazotization of the Compounds [XV]</p>
    <p>The carboxylic group of the starting compounds [XV] employed in this reaction may be protected by the similar manner as mentioned in the above compounds [IV]. The reaction is generally conducted in a solvent, for example, water of a mixture of water and organic solvents which are readily miscible with water and do not disturb the present reaction such as alcohols e.g. methanol, ethanol, etc., ethers e.g. tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, etc. As the diazotization reagents, nitrous acids, alkyl nitrites, nitrogen dioxide, nitrosyl chloride, etc. are conveniently employed and, among them, sodium nitrite, amyl nitrite, etc. are generally used. The reaction is generally conducted in the presence of an acid at a selected temperature within the range of 0° to 50° C. for a selected time of one to several hours. The acid employed in the reaction is exemplified by hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, formic acid, acetic acid, etc.</p>
    <p>While α-oximino-2-substituted-thiazol-4-ylacetic acid derivatives involved in these compounds [XIV] and [XVI] may occur theoretically as syn- and anti-isomer with respect to oximino group, each of the both isomers can be used, similarly for the present reaction.</p>
    <p>(g) Reaction of the Compounds [XVII] and Trihalogenoacetone</p>
    <p>The symbol R<sup>14</sup> represents such amino group which may be protected as illustrated hereinbefore and, therefore, the compounds (XVII) are exemplified by N-(trichloroethoxycarbonyl)thiourea, N-(t-butoxycarbonyl)thiourea, N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)thiourea, etc. As the trihalogenoacetone, there are generally used, for example, 1,1,3-trichloroacetone, 1,1,3-tribromoacetone, etc.</p>
    <p>The reaction may be carried out advantageously in the solvent. Any solvent which can dissolve both starting materials may be employed so far as it does not disturb the reaction, and more preferably one is exemplified by alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, etc., ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, etc., ethers such as ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxan, etc., or mixture thereof. The present reaction proceeds more smoothly in the presence of base such as pyridine, picoline, quinoline, isoquinoline, triethylamine, tributylamine, N-methylpiperidine, N-methylmorpholine, N,N-dimethylaniline, N,N-diethylaniline, etc. The reaction may proceed under room temperature and is accelerated by heating. Therefore, it is convenient to heat at about boiling point of the solvent employed. When a suitable conditions is selected in the present reaction, an intermediate i.e. 4-bromomethylthiazole may be obtained in some cases.</p>
    <p>Thus obtained compounds [XVIII] are subjected to addition reaction of hydrogen cyanide to give so-called cyanhydrin compounds. For this purpose, cyanides such as sodium cyanide, potassium cyanide, etc. are generally reacted with the compounds [XVIII]. The cyanhydrin compounds can be isolated as stable acyl derivatives by protecting with a suitable protective group e.g. formyl, acetyl, etc. Example of the desirable procedure is to react acetic anhydride with the cyanhydrin compounds in pyridine. The reaction to obtain the cyanhydrin compounds or their derivatives is preferably conducted in the solvent in the presence of base. The solvent is desired to dissolve both of the starting compounds and base, and water or a mixture of water and organic solvent miscible with water (e.g. methanol, ethanol, acetone, dimethylformamide, etc.) are generally employed. As the base employed, there may be conveniently used, for example, such weak base as potassium dihydrogen phosphate, sodium hydrogen sulfite, triethylamine, etc. The reaction is carried out advantageously under cooling or at the neighborhood of room temperature to avoid undesirable side reaction. The reaction to obtain the cyanhydrin compounds as α-acetoxy-acetonitrile derivatives is usually conducted by reacting acetic anhydride with the former compounds in the solvent under the presence of base. In this reaction, any of solvent so far as it does not disturb the reaction may be employed and there may be generally used, for example, aprotic solvent such as chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, tetrahydrofuran, pyridine, dimethylformamide, etc., or mixture thereof. Any base so far as it does not disturb the present reaction can be employed and preferable ones are organic tertiary base such as pyridine, quinoline, isoquinoline, triethylamine, N,N-dimethylaniline, etc. Among them, pyridine is most preferable because it also works as solvent. Acetic anhydride mentioned above is most preferable as the acylating agent, but other acylating agent including acetyl chloride may be also employed. The reaction proceeds smoothly under cooling, but, if desired, it may be conducted in the neighborhood of room temperature.</p>
    <p>Thus obtained cyanhydrin compounds containing their acyl derivatives are subjected to hydrolysis to give the contemplated compounds [XIX]. The hydrolysis is carried out in the solvent under the presence of acid or base. As the solvent, methanol or ethanol are generally used. The reaction is conducted advantageously under cooling to in the neighborhood of room temperature to avoid the undesirable side reaction. In the reaction, inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, etc. is preferably employed as acid and sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, etc. is used as base.</p>
    <p>While thus obtained α-hydroxyacetic acid derivatives [XIX] is racemic mixture, it can be resolved into optical active isomers i.e. D-form and L-form by per se known processes, for example, by introducing them into a suitable diasteromer.</p>
