Each screen is configured as a drawer supported within an enclosure for insertion and removal, at will. Clean lint discharged from the first cleaning stage passes through an air gap and into a duct connected to an aspirating nozzle for further separation of particulate material. A linear belt conveyor receives particulate material and fine lint from the first cleaning stage for discharge to a second cleaning stage also comprising a series of rotary drum beaters. Separating screens associated with each beater of the second cleaning stage are also configured to be inserted in and removed from an enclosure, at will. A third cleaning stage comprises a vibrating screen. Lint discharged from the second and third stages is inducted by an pneumatic conveying system, including an aspirating or induction nozzle. Spaced apart tubular air jet manifolds are disposed below the screens of at least the first cleaning stage and are supported on the apparatus frame for movement between working and nonworking positions of respective rows of jet nozzle ports in the manifolds by pneumatic actuators whereby the manifolds may be moved to a position to prevent clogging of the nozzle ports by particulate material falling through the screens.</div>

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention pertains to a multistage cleaning apparatus, including plural rotary beater stages, a vibratory separator stage, and a linear conveyor between beater stages for cleaning cotton lint to remove seed hulls, field trash and other contaminants which are carried over with the lint from a cottonseed delinting operation, for example.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading> <p>In the processing of cottonseed, it is desirable to remove as much lint as possible from the seed hull in order to improve the seed processing operation and the yield of quality cottonseed oil. For many years, it has been recognized that the fine cotton lint removed from cottonseed in delinting equipment has commercial value. Clean cotton lint is essentially 100% cellulose and has well established commercial applications, such as use as a binder in manufactured paper, as hygienic cotton for medical and personal use, in the manufacture of munitions and essentially any commercial application which requires a cellulose based material. However, essentially all of the above-mentioned commercial applications of fine cotton lint requires a clean lint product.</p>
    <p>The production of high quality, substantially clean cotton lint has experienced longstanding problems. Removal of all foreign matter, such as seed hulls, plant particles, field dirt and similar trash or "pepper" from the fine gauzy lint is difficult since the lint is of such low mass and many of the aforementioned fine particulates are also of such low mass as to make separation from the lint a vexatious problem. Lint cleaning apparatus have been developed which require multiple stages of cleaning with a rotary drum type beating operation, typically used as the first stage, followed by conveying the partially cleaned lint to second and third stages using auger-type conveyors. The second and third stage cleaning mechanisms have also been characterized somewhat as auger flight type structures with spiral shaped members which include small paddles or beater portions formed on the peripheral edge of the auger flight.</p>
    <p>It has been determined, in pursuing the development of lint cleaning apparatus to provide ever greater purities in a range of 75% to 80% clean lint, that the auger or stationary basket-type cleaning stages, as well as the auger conveyors used in transporting the lint between stages, tend to compact the lint to defy or reduce the ability to rid the lint of seed hulls, motes, and other particulate contaminants trapped in the gauzy lint material. Accordingly, further improvements have been sought in lint cleaning apparatus which will minimize compacting of the lint during the cleaning process, provide a final cleaned lint product having a greater purity than heretofore obtainable with prior art apparatus, provide for cleaning lint from different cotton-producing regions, climates or from cotton picked under different weather conditions and using various types of equipment, be capable of cleaning cotton lint of different varieties, be capable of being easily cleaned itself and provide a combination of cleaning stages which meet all of the desiderata stated above. It is to these ends that the present invention has been developed.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>The present invention provides an improved lint cleaning apparatus, particularly adapted for cleaning cotton lint which has been produced in a cottonseed delinting operation.</p>
    <p>In accordance with one aspect of the present invention a multi-stage lint cleaning apparatus is provided which minimizes compacting of lint being processed by the apparatus, produces lint having a higher degree of cleanliness than is provided by prior art apparatus and accomplishes the cleaning operation in substantially three cleaning stages. In particular, the first cleaning stage comprises a multiple rotary drum beater stage, the second cleaning stage also comprises a multiple rotary drum beater stage and the third stage comprises a vibrating screen or so-called shale shaker stage. Clean lint is drawn off after each stage by a pneumatic conveying flue system and lint cleaned in the second and third stages is recycled back through the apparatus.</p>
    <p>In accordance with another aspect of the present invention a multiple rotary drum beater type lint-cleaning apparatus is provided wherein separator screens associated with each drum-type beater may be easily removed for heavy cleaning or replaced with screens having different porosity or sieve size to accommodate different lint characteristics, expected types of contaminants or the like. In particular, each rotary drum beater is provided with a screen which is mounted on a removable drawer disposed in the beater cabinet whereby each drawer may be easily inserted in a working position of the screen or removed from the cabinet for cleaning or replacement of the screen.</p>
    <p>In accordance with another aspect of the present invention a multi-stage lint cleaning apparatus is provided wherein lint and contaminant materials passing from a first stage to a second stage are conveyed by a linear, generally planar conveyor, such as endless belt-type conveyor to minimize compacting of the lint and to allow the lint to reside, generally widely dispersed and fluffed so that further separation of seed hulls, shale and other contaminants may be carried out in the second stage.</p>
    <p>In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention a lint cleaning apparatus is provided wherein separating screens which are adapted to separate clean lint from contaminants and fine lint entrained with the contaminants are easily cleaned in situ and at will by an arrangement of multiple air jet discharge manifolds which are disposed in proximity to the lint separator screens for cleaning the screens to remove clogged screen ports or openings. The manifolds are preferably characterized as elongated tubular members which are supported for rotation between a working position and a position which orients air jet nozzles in the manifolds in such a way as to substantially minimize clogging the nozzles with lint or trash material flowing through the screens and impinging on the manifolds.</p>
    <p>The present invention still further provides an improved arrangement of multiple lint cleaning stages, including a vibrating screen or shale shaker type final cleaning stage, to prevent compacting of the lint as it is being cleaned as well as while being transported between stages. The lint cleaning apparatus advantageously utilizes two multiple rotary drum beater cleaning stages which are operated to rotate drum-type beaters in such a way as to optimize the cleaning and separating effect of the beaters as the lint is moved progressively from one rotary drum beater to the next in each stage.</p>
    <p>Those skilled in the art will further appreciate the above-mentioned advantages and features of the invention together with other important aspects thereof upon reading the detailed description which follows in conjunction with the drawing.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading> <p>In the description which follows like parts are marked throughout the specification and drawing with the same reference numerals, respectively. The drawing figures are not necessarily to scale and certain features may be shown in generalized or somewhat schematic form in the interest of clarity and conciseness.</p>
    <p>Referring to FIG. 1 there is illustrated an improved lint cleaning apparatus in accordance with the invention and generally designated by the numeral 20. The lint cleaning apparatus 20 comprises a frame 22, generally characterized by four spaced apart upstanding corner post members 22a, two shown in FIG. 1, supported on a subframe 22b which is a generally rectangular skeletal box. Longitudinal frame members 22c and 22d interconnect the post members 22a to form a second generally rectangular skeletal boxlike frame disposed on top of subframe 22b. The apparatus 20 is advantageously characterized by a first lint cleaning stage, generally designated by numeral 24, which comprises a plurality of series arranged rotary drum beaters to be described in further detail herein. The aforedescribed beaters are disposed in adjacent, generally rectangular box-like cabinets or enclosures 26 and 28. The enclosures 26 and 28 include removable top cover members 26a and 28a, respectively, and cover 26a includes a dirty lint inlet port 26a'. Enclosure 28 has a clean lint discharge port formed by a duct 29 which discharges lint into an air gap 30 adjacent the inlet of an aspirating nozzle 31 suitably mounted on and adjacent enclosure 28 for entraining clean lint. A trash discharge duct 32 is disposed below the air gap 30 and includes an inlet hopper portion 33 for receiving particulate material trash which is separated from clean lint being discharged from the first stage outlet duct 29 as it is inducted into nozzle 31. Trash separated from clean lint in the air gap 30 flows to a suitable receptacle 34 mounted on the subframe 22b.</p>
    <p>The apparatus 20 includes a second lint cleaning stage, generally designated by numeral 36, and comprising a generally boxlike cabinet or enclosure 38 in which a plurality of side-by-side rotary drum beater devices are mounted and are similar in construction to the aforementioned beater devices in cleaning stage 24. Relatively fine lint and particulate material which is not carried over to discharge duct 29 is conveyed to cleaning stage 36 by a linear, generally planar endless belt-type conveyor 40 having an inlet comprising an elongated depending duct 42 disposed below the cleaning stage 24 and a discharge duct 44 which is in communication with the interior of the enclosure 38 for conveying lint and particulate material to the second cleaning stage 36. Lint cleaned by cleaning stage 36 is discharged from enclosure 38 through a discharge duct 46 and is inducted into a pneumatic aspirating nozzle 48 in communication with a common air conduit transition part 50. A second aspirating nozzle 52 is connected to an inlet plenum 52a and to air conduit transition part 50. Plenum 52a is disposed for entraining clean lint at the discharge end of a third lint cleaner stage comprising a vibrating screen separator and conveyor assembly 54. Particulate material and lint which is not carried over to discharge duct 46 from cleaning stage 36 descends through a discharge duct 58 to the vibrating screen separator and conveyor 54 for a final separation of particulate material from lint.</p>
    <p>Referring further to FIG. 1, the lint cleaning apparatus 20 is in circuit with a system comprising a motor driven centrifugal fan or blower, 60 which is operable to convey lint contaminated with particulate material, such as seed hulls, plant particles, field dirt and similar particulate materials which typically are found in cotton lint taken from a seed delinting operation. This contaminated lint is conveyed to the motor driven blower or fan 60 by way of a suitable conduit 62 from a source, not shown, and is conveyed through the blower in a conventional manner to a cyclone separator 64 wherein the conveying air is separated from the lint and lint is then conveyed primarily by gravity and some conveying air by way of a conduit 66 to the inlet port 26a' of rotary drum beater stage 24. A second motor driven centrifugal blower or vacuum pump 70 is connected to a conduit 72 which is connected to air aspirating nozzle 31 for entraining lint cleaned by the cleaning stage 24 for discharge through the pump 70 to a clean lint discharge conduit 74. As shown in FIG. 1, the air conduit transition part 50 is adapted to be connected to either the conduit 72 or to the conduit 62 for recirculating lint entrained by the transition part 50 from the air aspirating nozzles 48 and 52. Blower or fan 60 may have sufficient capacity to cause sufficient flow of air through inlet aspirating nozzles 48 and 52 and air transition part 50 even if the transition part 50 is connected to conduit 62 by way of a connecting conduit 67, as shown. Alternatively, nozzle 31 and air transition part 50 may be characterized as air-lint eductor nozzles energized by a source of motive air in a conventional manner. In all events, positive flow of clean lint may be obtained with the system shown in either arrangement of the discharge flow path for material leaving aspirating nozzle 31 and air transition part 50.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIGS. 2, 3 and 4, and FIG. 2 in particular, the apparatus 20 is shown in further detail wherein, for example, the first lint cleaning stage 24, as illustrated, comprises eight, side by side, rotatable drum beaters 80 which are mounted for rotation in a counterclockwise direction, viewing FIG. 2, within the enclosures 26 and 28, respectively, as shown. The beaters 80 are mounted adjacent respective, generally arcuate, separator screens 82 supported adjacent to and below each of the rotary beaters 80. Plural spaced apart partitions 84 depend within the enclosures 26 and 28 from the covers 26a and 28 a, respectively, between each of the beaters 80 for controlling the flow of lint through the cleaning stage 24. Particulate laden lint enters the enclosure 26 through the port 26a' and is beaten or agitated severely while being conveyed by the rotating beaters 80 from one to the other serially toward the discharge duct 29 attached to an endwall 28b of enclosure 28. As shown in FIGS. 2 and 6, enclosure 26 includes opposed sidewalls 26b and 26c and an endwall 26d, FIG. 2. Enclosure 28 is similarly constructed and the ends of enclosures 26 and 28 which abut each other are open. Of course, the bottom side of each of the enclosures 26, 28 and 38 is open also. Substantially dirt free lint is discharged from the duct 29 through the air gap 30 and is inducted into the aspirating nozzle 31 for final discharge from the apparatus 20 by way of the vacuum pump-blower 70 and discharge conduit 74.</p>
    <p>Lint and particulate material which passes through the respective screens 82 is discharged via the duct 42 onto the surface of an endless belt 86, FIGS. 2 and 6, disposed within a generally rectangular boxlike enclosure 41 of the conveyor 40. Belt 86 includes an upper generally planar material conveying run 86a and is trained over respective rollers 88 and 90 at opposite ends of enclosure 41 for the conveyor 40. Adjustable guide or idler rollers 89 are also supported by the enclosure 41 adjacent the respective conveyor rollers 88 and 90, as shown, for tensioning the belt along its return run 86b. Conveyor roller 90 is suitably rotatably driven by a motor and gear reduction drive unit 91, FIG. 2, which is drivably connected to the roller 90 for traversing the endless belt 86 in the direction of arrow 86c as shown in the cut away portion of the duct 42 and the enclosure 41 in FIG. 2.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, short fiber lint and particulate material which has been separated in the beater type cleaning stage 24 falls onto the conveyor belt 86 and is traversed in the direction of arrow 86c to discharge duct 44 whereupon this material drops into enclosure 38 of cleaning stage 36 by way of an inlet port 37a. formed in a removable top cover 37 of the enclosure 38. The enclosure 38 supports a plurality of spaced apart rotatable drum-type beater members 92 arranged in a side-by-side series flow arrangement for the lint and particulate material entering the enclosure 38 through the port 37a. The beaters 92 are supported for rotation in the same counterclockwise direction, viewing FIG. 2, by the enclosure 38 and are drivenly connected to drive means to be described in further detail herein. Each beater 92 also includes an arcuate separator screen 94 disposed under and adjacent thereto and similar to the screens 82. Screens 94 are disposed for separating lint and particulate material from lint which is beat or agitated and carried over from each beater 92 to the next so that substantially clean lint progresses from inlet port 37a to discharge duct 46 for transfer to air aspirating nozzle 48 by entraining air flowing into the nozzle at an air gap 47, FIG. 2.</p>
    <p>Lint and particulate material which falls through the separator screens 94 is guided by the duct 58 onto a generally planar perforated screen 99 of the vibrating screen separator stage 54. Particulate material separated from clean lint in the air gap 47 also falls onto the perforated screen 99. The screen 99 is supported on a generally rectangular open top, shallow pan 100 having a generally planar bottom plate 102 spaced below the screen. The pan 100 is canted at a moderate angle from the horizon so that a discharge end 103 of the pan is disposed lower than an upper or inlet end 104. The discharge end 103 of the pan 100 is devoid of an endwall to allow particulate material to descend along the plate 102 and fall into the receptacle 34. A suitable auger conveyor 34a is disposed in receptacle 34 for conveying particulate material away from the apparatus 20 for disposal. As previously discussed, lint deposited on the screen. 99 moves progressively along the screen toward the discharge end 103 of the pan 100 until it is directly under inlet port 52b of plenum 52a whereupon air inducted through the port into the air transition part 50 will entrain clean lint from screen 99 into and through the aspirating nozzle 52 to the air transition part 50 for further conveyance as described above and shown in FIG. 1.</p>
    <p>The vibrating screen cleaning or separator stage 54 is further characterized by flexible support structure for the pan 100 and its associated screen 99 and bottom plate 102. In particular, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 6, the pan 100 is supported by four upstanding leaf spring members 106 and 108 which are spaced apart from each other on opposite sides of the pan 100 and suitably thereto by brackets 107, respectively. Elongated reciprocating rods 110, one shown in FIG. 2, are each connected to the pan 100 by a suitable connector 112 at one end thereof. The opposite ends of the respective rods 110 are connected to crank throws 114, one shown, of an eccentric drive comprising a crankshaft 116 supported for rotation on frame 22 b and drivenly connected to a drive motor 118 through suitable drive means including an endless belt 120. Accordingly, rotation of the crankshaft 116 causes relatively rapid reciprocation of the rods 110 and the pan 100 to vibrate the screen 99 to effect separation of particulate material from lint deposited on the screen and to progressively move the lint toward the inlet port 52b of the air aspirating nozzle 52.</p>
    <p>Those skilled in the art will appreciate from the foregoing description of the progression of lint and particulate material through the apparatus 20, that the rotary drum beaters 80 and 92 effectively separate particulate material from lint progressing through the respective cleaning and separating stages 24 and 36. Lint which falls through the separator screens 82 and 94 is also maintained in a noncompacted condition thanks to the arrangement of the endless belt conveyor 40 and the vibrating screen or shale shaker type separating and cleaning stage 54, respectively. In this way cleaned lint which is recovered by the transition duct or part 50, in particular, has not been compacted as a result of the cleaning operation.</p>
    <p>Referring further to FIGS. 2, 3, 4 and 6, each of the rotary drum beaters 80 is characterized by a shaft 80a, see FIG. 6, supported for rotation on spaced apart bearings 122 which are, respectively, supported on sidewalls 26b and 26c of the enclosure 26, for example. The beaters 80 disposed in enclosure 28 are supported in a similar manner to that described and shown in FIG. 6. One end of shaft 80a is provided with spaced apart drive pulleys 124 and 126 supported on the shaft 80a for rotation therewith. Spaced apart cylindrical hub members 80b are supported on the shaft 80a and support a cylindrical cover part 80c of beater 80 and on which circumferentially spaced apart rows of radially outward projecting beater pins 80d are mounted, as shown in FIG. 6. Further clarification of the arrangement of the beater pins 80d may be obtained from viewing FIG. 7 also.</p>
    <p>The sidewall 26b of enclosure 26 includes suitable spaced apart openings 26b', one shown in FIG. 6, through which each screen 82 may be inserted in the enclosure and removed therefrom, at will. Enclosure 28 is also provided with such openings for insertion and removal of screens 82 with respect thereto. Referring briefly to FIG. 5, one of the screens 82 is shown in further detail as being characterized by a partial arcuate plate having longitudinally extending and circumferentially spaced rows of slots 130 formed therein of a suitable pattern and opening size to provide for separation of particulate material and short lint fibers from lint passing through the separator or cleaning stage 24. Each screen 82 includes opposed transverse end plate members 132 and 134 and longitudinal reinforcing members 136 and 138 extending therebetween as shown. A drawer plate member 140 may be removably connected to screen support plate 134 by conventional mechanical fasteners, not shown, and is provided with a suitable handle means 142 thereon. Each screen 82 may be inserted in enclosure 26 or 28 to a working position, such as through a suitable opening 26b' in sidewall 26b, for example, to the position shown in FIG. 6. Each screen 82 may be selectively removed from its working position by merely sliding the screen out of the enclosure 26 or 28, when desired. In this way each of the screens 82 may be removed and replaced by a screen having a different size of its respective slots 130 to accommodate different lint sources, types of lint and so forth to provide more effective cleaning and separation of particulate material therefrom. Accordingly, by merely inserting or removing the drawer-like screen or screens 82, with respect to the enclosure 26 or 28 each screen may be interchanged, at will. As shown in FIG. 7, the screens 82 are suitably supported by transverse narrow cross section beam members 146 and 148, two shown in FIG. 7, which are spaced apart from each other and extend between the frame members 22d below the respective screens.</p>
    <p>Referring now to FIGS. 3 and 4, the rotary drum beaters 80 are each rotatably driven by a drive train including a suitable drive motor 150 supported on a bracket 151 secured to enclosure 26. Motor 150 is drivably connected to the first beater 80 adjacent the port 26a ' through an endless belt 152 trained over a drive pulley 154 mounted on shaft 80a of the first beater. The shaft 80a of the first beater 80 which is disposed adjacent to the port 26a' also supports a drive pulley 124 which is drivably connected to a drive pulley 124 of the second beater 80 by an endless drive belt 156. The shaft 80a of the second beater 80 also supports a drive pulley 126 which is drivably connected to a second drive belt 156. Each successive stage of the eight stages of beaters 80, except the last stage, support drive pulleys 124 and 126 on their respective shafts 80a and which are connected to each other through respective sets of drive belts 156, as shown in FIG. 4, so that all of the beaters 80 are driven in the same direction at substantially the same rotative speed and may be driven in timed relationship to each other. For example, the pulleys 124 and 126 may have suitable cogs formed thereon and the belts 156 may also be cog belts or otherwise adapted for driving the beaters 80 in timed relationship to each other, if desired. Other conventional drive means such as endless chains, gear trains or the like may be used in place of the drive belt arrangement shown in FIGS. 3 and 4. The pulleys 124 and 126 may also be replaced by pulleys of larger or smaller effective diameter so that the speeds of the respective beaters 80 may be varied, if desired.</p>
    <p>Referring again to FIG. 6, one of the beaters 92 is illustrated supported between opposed side plates 38b and 38c of the enclosure 38. Each beater 92 includes a shaft 92a mounted for rotation on spaced apart bearings 160 suitably supported on the side walls 38b and 38c of the enclosure 38. Each beater 92 also includes circumferentially spaced apart axially extending rows of beater pins 92d which are supported on and project radially outwardly from a hub portion 92b of shaft 92a.</p>
    <p>Sidewall 38b also includes spaced apart openings 38b', one shown, formed therein for insertion of and removal of the separator screens 94 from the lint cleaning stage 36 in the same manner that the screens 82 may be inserted in and removed from the enclosures 26 or 28 of the cleaning stage 24. Each arcuate screen 94 may, for example, have opposed transverse end plate members 94a and 94b, FIG. 6, and wherein end plate 94b is secured to a planar drawer plate member 162 shown contiguous with sidewall 38b in the working position of screen 94 in FIG. 6. The screens 94 are thus constructed substantially like the screens 82 and are insertable in and removable from the enclosure 38 in the same manner that the screens 82 are insertable in and removable from the enclosures 26 and 28.</p>
    <p>The beaters 92 are rotatably driven by drive means, also comprising a drive motor 170, FIG. 3, drivably connected to an endless belt 172 which is trained around a pulley 174 supported on shaft 92a of the first beater stage of the cleaning stage 36. A second drive pulley 176 is also mounted on shaft 92a of the first beater stage and is drivably connected to the second beater stage shaft 92a by way of a belt 178 trained around a second pulley 176. The second through the seventh beater stages of the cleaning stage 36 are also provided with dual drive pulleys 176 and 177 arranged in the same manner as the pulleys 124 and 126 for the beaters of cleaning stage 24, as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4. However, successive beaters 92 arranged seriatim downstream from each other in the cleaning stage 36 may have drive pulleys mounted on the respective shafts 92a of slightly different diameter in order to provide progressively increasing linear tip speeds of the pins 92d of these successive beater stages to facilitate a lint beating and cleaning process in accordance with the invention. Higher beater pin tip speeds are desirable to adequately beat or clean the shorter lint fibers processed by the cleaning stage 36. The fourth beater stage of the cleaning stage 36, as shown in FIG. 6, for example, includes an outboard drive pulley 176 and an inboard drive pulley 177, the inboard drive pulley 177 being of a slightly smaller effective diameter than the pulley 176. By suitable arrangement of the drive pulleys 176 and 177 on the shafts 92a the rotational speeds of the respective beaters 92 may be varied as desired and thus the tip speeds of the pins 92d of each beater stage will be varied in accordance with the rotational speeds of the rotor shafts on which these pins are mounted.</p>
    <p>Referring again to FIGS. 2, 6 and 7, the cleaning apparatus 20 advantageously includes a pressure air jet or air blast systems for cleaning the respective screens 82 of cleaning stage 24. As shown in FIGS. 2 and 6, each of the beaters 80 forming a beater stage is provided with two spaced apart elongated air jet manifolds 182 disposed below the screens 82 and spaced apart from each other between the respective elongated support members 136 for each screen 82. The manifolds 182 are characterized as elongated cylindrical tubes extending between the frame members 22d and supported thereby for limited rotation by mechanism described hereinbelow. Each manifold 182 includes a plurality of spaced apart air jet nozzles or ports 184 formed therein and generally axially aligned with each other. Each manifold 182 is closed at one end by a suitable closure member 188 which is also operable to retain the manifold on the frame 22 for the limited rotation mentioned above. The opposite end of each manifold 182 is also journaled by a suitable bushing 189, FIG. 6, mounted on the manifold adjacent a frame member 22d. Each manifold 182 projects through suitable bearing bores in the frame members 22d and is supported by the frame members for limited rotation thereon so that the ports 184 may be moved between working positions directed generally upwardly toward the screens 82 and non-working positions projecting generally downwardly to prevent material passing through the screens 82 from falling into and clogging the respective ports. Two spaced apart manifolds 182 are disposed below each of the screens 82, as indicated in FIG. 2.</p>
    <p>Referring now primarily to FIGS. 7, 8 and 9, each of the manifolds 182 is provided, at one end thereof, with a crank member 190 secured to the manifold and pivotally connected to a link 192 or 194, which links are connected to respective opposite ends of a linear actuator 196 comprising a pressure fluid actuated cylinder and piston type actuator, for example. Link 192 is suitably connected to the distal end of a linearly extensible piston rod 197 and link 194 is suitably connected to the opposite end of a cylinder member 198 of actuator 196. The actuator 196 may be a double acting type having suitable ports to which are connected flexible pressure fluid conduits 200 and 202, respectively. Alternatively, the actuator 196 may be pressure fluid. actuated in one direction and operated by a spring mechanism to return to a predetermined position when deenergized. Each pair of manifolds 182 associated with a beater 80 and screen 82 is connected to an actuator 196, as shown, for example, for the beaters in enclosure 26, FIG. 11.</p>
    <p>In the position of the actuator 196 shown in FIG. 7, the manifolds 182 are rotated to position their nozzles or ports 184 generally downwardly so that particulate material and fine or short lint fibers passing through the screen 82 will not clog the ports as such material falls from the enclosures 26 or 28 onto the conveyor belt 86 by way of the duct 42. However, when it is desired to clean and unclog the slots 130 of screens 82, for example, the actuator 196 is moved from the position shown in FIG. 7 to the position shown in FIG. 8 wherein the ports 184 of each manifold 182 are oriented to eject pressure fluid, such as compressed air, toward the screen 82 to dislodge any material which may be clogging the slots 130. As the actuators 196 for each of the screens 82 are extended further to a working position as indicated in FIG. 9, the manifolds 182 are rotated so that the ports 184 sweep across the underside of the screens 82 to dislodge any material which may be clogging any of the slots 130. The range of coverage of the air jet action which is provided by the manifolds 182 is indicated by lines 184a, 184b in FIG. 7, for each of the manifolds. Accordingly, as the manifolds 182 are rotated to the position of FIG. 8 pressure air may be supplied to the manifolds to begin the air jet cleaning action and as the manifolds are further rotated to the position of FIG. 9 the ports 184 are rotated between the lines 184a and 184b to sweep an air jet curtain across the screens 82 between the respective sets of lines 184a and 184b to substantially cover the entire working area of the screens 82 and to dislodge any material which has clogged any of the slots 130. When the cleaning action has been completed, the actuator 196 for each of the screens 82 is returned to the position shown in FIG. 7.</p>
    <p>Referring now to the schematic diagram of FIG. 10, each of the manifolds 182 is operable to be supplied with pressure air from a reservoir or accumulator tank 210 which is preferably adapted to be mounted on and adjacent to one of the frame members 22d on spaced apart brackets 211, as shown in FIGS. 3 and 6. The reservoir 210 is adapted to be supplied with pressure air from a source, not shown, by way of a conduit 212, FIG. 10, connected to one end of the reservoir. A branch conduit 214 is also connected to the above-mentioned source of pressure air and to an elongated supply conduit 216 for respective control valves 218 for each of the actuators 196, as indicated schematically in FIG. 10. Each of the valves 218 may be a solenoid actuated reversible valve operable to move an actuator 196 connected thereto between the position shown in FIG. 7 and the positions shown in FIGS. 8 and 9. A pressure regulator 215 is interposed in conduit 214 and a suitable solenoid actuated blowdown valve 217 is also connected to reservoir 210.</p>
    <p>Each set of manifolds 182 is supplied with pressure air from the reservoir 210 by way of a solenoid actuated valve 222, which is connected to a discharge conduit 224 having respective branch portions 224a and 224b. Each of the conduits 224a and 224b may be connected to a suitable swivel type coupling 226 suitably connected to each of the manifolds 182 so that the manifolds may rotate relative to the conduits 224a and 224b, respectively. A suitable control circuit, not shown, may be provided for energizing each of the valves 218 and 222 at selected time intervals and in timed relationship with respect to each other to rotate the manifolds 182 and supply pressure air thereto, respectively. For example, each successive beater stage having a beater 80 disposed therein may have its screen 82 cleaned sequentially if the apparatus 20 is momentarily shut down or lint inflow is terminated, for example. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the beater stages of cleaning stage 36 may also be provided with an array of air jet cleaning manifolds, such as the manifolds 182, arranged in a substantially similar manner and supported below each screen 94 for providing air jet blast cleaning of the slots or openings in the screens 94 to unclog same, when desired.</p>
    <p>The construction and operation of the cleaning apparatus 20 is believed to be within the purview of one of ordinary skill in the art from the foregoing description. However, briefly, the proportions of the beaters 80 and 92 have been determined to be such that, in a preferred embodiment, the diameter of the cylindrical cover 80c of each of the beaters 80 may be approximately 14.0 inches and the length of each beater 80 may be approximately 48.0 inches. The radial height of each of the pins 80d may be approximately 2.0 inches. The pins 80d are spaced along the length of the cylindrical cover 80c such that about twenty pins per row are provided and twelve rows of pins are circumferentially spaced about the axis of rotation of each shaft 80a. The beaters 80 are preferably rotated at a speed of about 200 rpm to 240 rpm. It has been determined that a tip speed of the pins 80d in the range of about 1130 feet per minute (plus or minus 5%) is an optimal speed to prevent damaging cotton lint fibers while also removing a substantial amount of particulate material trapped in the lint. The proportions of the slots 130 for the screens 82 may be somewhat elongated or oval shaped and range from 0.31 inches width by 1.0 inches length to 0.12 inches width by 0.63 inches length, depending on the characteristics of the lint being processed. Lint (and particulate material) which drops through the screens 82 onto the conveyor beltrun 86a is not compacted due to the large generally planar area of the belt which is presented to the material as it falls through the duct 42 onto the belt generally planar surface. The proportions of the conveyor 40 are such that the width of the belt 86 is at least about seventy five percent of the length of the beaters 80 so that minimal compacting or piling of the lint material occurs as some lint slides along sloped sidewalls of duct 42 during transfer from the cleaning stage 24 to the conveyor 40.</p>
    <p>Since the lint fibers which are introduced to the cleaning stage 36 are shorter, as a result of being separated from the longer fibers in cleaning stage 24, the configuration of the beaters 92 is somewhat different. For example, the overall radial height or length of the pins 92d is in the range of about 2.0 inches to 3.50 inches, and the overall diameter of the beater 92 is about 8.0 inches to 11.0 inches. Preferably, six rows of beater pins 92d are spaced apart circumferentially about the shaft hub 92b and the pins are spaced apart about 1.125 inches, giving an overall number of forty-two pins per row. The first stage beater 92 is rotated at a speed of about 200 rpm and each successive stage is rotated at a speed about 5% higher than the previous stage by an appropriate proportioning of the drive pulleys 176 and 177 for each shaft 92a. The slots formed in screens 94 may be elongated or oval and range from dimensions of about 0.12 inches width by 1.0 inch length to about 0.38 inches width to 0.62 inches length, again depending on the characteristics of the lint being cleaned.</p>
    <p>The vibrating screen separator or cleaning stage 54 may be arranged such that the pan 100 is oriented at a slope of about 7.50 degrees off of the horizon toward the receptacle 34. The crankshaft 116 and crank linkage 114 and 110 may be proportioned such as to give a linear travel of about 0.75 inches for the pan 100. Screen 99 may have perforations of about 0.125 inches in diameter to about 0.187 inches in diameter, depending on the material being processed.</p>
    <p>The construction and operation of the apparatus 20, as mentioned previously, is believed to be within the purview of the skilled artisan in lint cleaning apparatus based on the foregoing description. Conventional materials used for lint cleaning apparatus may be used in apparatus 20. However, those skilled in the art will further appreciate that various substitutions and modifications may be made to the embodiment disclosed herein without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as recited in the appended claims.</p>
