The volume of steam from a flash tank which flashes black liquor from a pulp digester may be increased (e.g. at least about 10%), while the volume and temperature of the liquor discharged from the flash tank are decreased and its concentration increased, by operatively connecting the jet ejector to the steam discharge from a flash tank. The jet ejector is supplied with higher pressure steam from another source which can result in a low pressure or partial vacuum condition in the flash tank. The flash tank may be a single flash tank or one of a series of flash tanks, and an ejector can be associated with at least another flash tank in the series. The hot spent cooking liquor from the digester can be cooled in a heat exchanger (for example in indirect heat exchange relationship with a fresh cooking liquor) prior to introduction in to the flash tank or series of flash tanks. Alternatively a jet ejector may be used to increase the pressure of a low pressure steam flow in a pulp mill to make it suitable for alternative uses.</div>

    <heading>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>In the pulp and paper art it is highly desirable to improve the steam economy of the flash tanks utilized (which flash tanks are, for example, shown per se in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,172,867, 4,551,198, and 5,700,355, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein). It may be possible to get such improved economy by decreasing chip bin or flash tank pressure to be able to get more flash steam from the flash tank. [Though the term “flash tank” is used throughout this discussion and is a term of the art, it is to be understood by those familiar with the art that this term includes any apparatus in which a hot pressurized liquid is exposed to a lower pressure and allowed to evaporate, typically violently, in an enclosed container to produce a source of steam and liquid at a lower temperature and pressure.] Black liquor could be directly flashed for example to a temperature 90° C. instead of 107° C. Then there would not be need for additional cooling of black liquor and also evaporation loading would slightly decrease. For example, the sub-atmospheric pressure in a flash tank could be maintained by a vacuum pump, such as shown in patent publication WO 97/29236.</p>
    <p>However, there is a better solution. One can get more flashed steam from a flash tank by using a steam jet ejector. For example in some continuous digesters it is normal to use much low pressure (LP) steam for steaming even in the summer time. By using some LP steam in a steam jet ejector one can produce more flashed steam and the total LP steam consumption would decrease. A steam jet ejector is a very simple device without any moving parts. The lower LP steam consumption utilizing a steam ejector may give hundreds of thousands of dollars of savings per year for continuous digesters. The investment cost of the ejector should be less than 20% of that and there are essentially no additional operating costs.</p>
    <p>There are also some other ways to use a steam jet ejector to improve energy efficiency in the digester area. For example LP steam pressure could be increased by medium pressure (MP) steam to be able to use the LP steam in digester heaters or a digester steam phase.</p>
    <p>A steam jet ejector (as seen in FIG. 1) is a venturi jet device that uses the energy available in steam to either a) create a vacuum, b) boost the pressure of a gas, or c) a combination of a) and b). Single stage ejectors can be used to create vacuum levels of about 75 torr (1.5 psia), when discharging to atmosphere. Steam ejectors per se in the pulp and paper art are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,139,620 and 4,692,214. In co-pending application 09/195,444 filed on Nov. 18, 1998 [attorney. ref. 10-1268] a jet ejector is used to increase the efficiency of a spent cooking chemical heat recovery system having reboilers.</p>
    <p>Black liquor is normally flashed in one or several stages against atmospheric pressure. Flashed steam is typically used to heat and expel air from the chips arriving to the process. This can be done for example in an atmospheric steaming vessel such as a DIAMONDBACK® chip bin (available from Ahistrom Machinery Inc. of Glens Falls, N.Y.), or in a conventional pressurized steaming vessel. Typically flashed steam is not enough to completely steam the chips and fresh low pressure steam is needed to complete steaming. Due to some friction losses and increased boiling point, black liquor temperature is typically about 107° C. after flashing. Before sending the flashed black liquor to an evaporation plant, the black liquor is typically cooled in a heat exchanger by water to temperature of about 90° C.</p>
    <p>By using a conventional steam jet ejector (see FIG. 1 herein) to enhance the use of flash steam in an atmospheric steaming vessel, the flash tank pressure could be decreased to a pressure of about 0.5-1.1 bar absolute (abs.) pressure, preferably about 0.7-1.0 bar abs., and the black liquor would then be flashed to a temperature of about 80-102° C., preferably about 90-100° C. This way the total amount of usable flashed steam would increase and the use of valuable fresh steam could be decreased. The “high pressure” steam utilized as a motive fluid of the steam jet ejector could be low pressure fresh steam, or flashed steam at a higher pressure from one or more previous flashing stages, or high pressure fresh steam. Additional benefits are that there is no longer a need to cool the black liquor going to the evaporation plant and the amount of black liquor to be evaporated would be slightly lower.</p>
    <p>A steam jet ejector could also be used in other environments in a Kraft (or other chemical pulping) cooking plant:</p>
    <p>Flashed steam pressure could be increased to be able to use it in a pressurized steaming vessel.</p>
    <p>Flash tank pressure could be decreased to get more steam to a flashed steam condenser to produce more hot water.</p>
    <p>Flashed or fresh low pressure steam pressure could be increased by higher pressure steam to be able to use it in the liquor heaters of a continuous digester.</p>
    <p>Flashed or fresh low pressure steam pressure could be increased by higher pressure steam to be able to use it in the steam phase of a continuous digester.</p>
    <p>Low pressure steam pressure could be increased by higher pressure steam to be able to use it in the direct or indirect liquor heaters of a batch digester.</p>
    <p>The broadest embodiment of the invention comprises a method of treating hot spent cooking liquor, having a first pressure and a first temperature, using a flash tank, having a high-pressure liquid inlet, a low-pressure liquid outlet, and a steam outlet; and an ejector, having a high-pressure gas inlet, a low-pressure gas inlet, and a gas discharge, to recover energy from the liquor, consisting of or comprising: (a) introducing the hot spent cooking liquor at the first pressure into the high-pressure liquid inlet of the flash tank; (b) exposing the liquor in the flash tank to a second pressure, lower than the first pressure, so that at least some of the liquor evaporates to form steam and a cooler liquid at about the second pressure and at about a second temperature, lower than the first temperature; (c) removing at least some of the steam from the flash tank in a first gaseous stream; (d) introducing the first gaseous stream to the low-pressure inlet of the ejector; (e) introducing a second gaseous stream having a third pressure, greater than the second pressure, to the high-pressure inlet of the ejector; and (f) discharging a third gaseous stream at a fourth pressure, higher than the second pressure, from the discharge outlet of the ejector; and wherein (a)-(f) are practiced so that the second pressure in the flash tank is lower (e.g. by at least about 0.1 bar abs) than the pressure that would be present in the flash tank without the presence of the ejector under otherwise substantially identical conditions. The present invention also includes practicing (a)-(f) so that the second pressure and the second temperature are lower than the pressure and temperature would be in the prior art without the presence of the ejector under otherwise substantially identical conditions.</p>
    <p>The method as recited above may further comprise (h) discharging concentrated hot spent cooking liquor from the flash tank at a temperature at least 2° C. lower than would be present without the utilization of the ejector under otherwise substantially identical conditions.</p>
    <p>The hot liquor is preferably hot spent extraction liquor removed from a kraft pulping process, for example, a continuous or batch pulping process. The liquor typically has a temperature of between about 100° C. to 180° C., preferably between about 110° and 160° C., that is, about the temperature of the pulping process, and a pressure ranging from about 5 to 15 bar gage (that is, 6 to 16 bar abs.)</p>
    <p>The present invention may also further include, prior to (a), (g) cooling the liquor from the first temperature to a third temperature, lower than the first temperature (e.g. by at least about 5° C.). The cooling process (g) is preferably practiced by passing the hot liquor in heat exchange relationship with a process liquid associated with the cooking process, for example, cooking chemical, such as kraft white, green, or black liquor, or dilution liquor or filtrate (for example, cold blow filtrate, washer filtrate or bleach plant filtrate). This cooler liquid typically has a temperature of less than 130° C. and is typically at between about 60 and 120° C., preferably between about 80 and 100° C.</p>
    <p>The second pressure in the flash tank is typically less than 4 bar absolute, for example, between about 0.1 to 2 bar abs., preferably between about 0.5 to 1.5 bar abs. The second temperature in the flash tank typically corresponds to the saturation temperature of the gas (typically “dirty” steam) generated by the exposure of the hot liquor to the second pressure. For example, when the second pressure is between about 0.5 to 1.5 bar abs., the second temperature is between about 80 and 110° C. The second gaseous stream, having a third pressure higher than the second pressure, introduced to the high-pressure inlet of the ejector is typically any available gas stream that will induce a lower pressure in the low-pressure inlet of the ejector. This second gaseous stream is preferably any flow of steam that is readily available in the pulp mill having any available third pressure. For example, the second gaseous stream may be “low-pressure steam” in which the third pressure may range from about 3.5 to 4.5 bar gage (that is, about 4.5 to 5.5 bar abs. or about 50 to 65 psig) or “medium-pressure steam” in which the third pressure may range from about 10 to 12 bar page (that is, 11 to 13 bar abs. or about 145 to 175 psig) or even “high pressure steam” in which the third pressure may range from 13 to 100 bar gage (that is, 14 to 101 bar abs. or about 200 to 1500 psig). The temperature of the second gaseous stream may be between about 100° to 250° C., but is typically, between about 140° to 160° C. Though the second gaseous stream is preferably “clean” steam, for example, steam having little or no sulfur compounds, according to the invention, the second gaseous stream may also be “dirty” steam. This steam may also be “fresh” steam.</p>
    <p>The fourth pressure of the third gaseous stream discharged from the ejector during (f), which according to the present invention is greater than the second pressure and lower than the third pressure, is typically a function of the magnitude of the second pressure and the third pressure. The fourth pressure may typically vary from about 0.5 to 5 bar abs., but is preferably between about 0.8 to 3 bar abs. This fourth pressure, according to the present invention, is typically about the same as or less than the pressure of the gas stream released from a prior art flash tank without the use of an ejector, although in some circumstances the fourth pressure may also be greater than the pressure of the gas stream released from a prior art flash tank under otherwise substantially identical conditions.</p>
    <p>According to the present invention, the use of the ejector to reduce the pressure inside a flash tank and then raise the pressure supplied to other equipment or processes, typically allows the flash evaporation of hot liquors to produce steam having lower temperatures and greater volumes than the prior art. The lower pressure also permits the lowering of the temperature of the cooled liquor sent, for example, to evaporation. For example, the temperature of the steam and liquid in the flash tank according to the present invention may be lowered at least about 2° C., typically at least about 5° C., preferably at least 10° C. compared to the prior art. At the same time, the volume of gas (steam) produced may typically be increased by at least about 10%, preferably at least 20%, sometimes even more than 40% compared to the prior art.</p>
    <p>The present invention may further include (h) discharging the cooler liquid formed at (b) from the low-pressure liquid outlet of the flash tank. The liquid discharged from the low-pressure outlet of the flash tank will typically have a temperature about equal to the second temperature and a pressure about equal to the second pressure. The temperature of this cooler liquid may be below 135° C., typically, below 110° C., preferably below 100° C. This liquid is may pass through two or more additional flash tanks, with or without ejectors according to the invention, and is typically forwarded to the recovery process. This cooler liquid may also be returned to the pulping process for treating the cellulose material prior to or during the pulping process.</p>
    <p>The present invention also includes a method of treating hot spent cooking liquor having a plurality of flash tanks having one or more ejectors wherein (a) through (f) are practiced in association with one or more of the flash tanks, preferably, with at least the last or final flash tank. The present invention may also include a plurality of flash tanks, one or more jet ejectors, and one or more heat exchangers wherein (a) through (f) are practiced in one or more flash tanks and (g) is practiced at least before the first flash tank.</p>
    <p>Another embodiment of this invention comprises a method of treating a first gaseous stream having a first pressure in a pulp mill to produce a second gaseous stream at a second pressure, higher than the first pressure, using a jet ejector having a high-pressure inlet, a low-pressure inlet, and a discharge outlet, consisting or comprising: (a) introducing the first gaseous stream having the first pressure to the high-pressure inlet of the jet ejector; (b) introducing the second gaseous stream to the low-pressure inlet of the jet ejector; and (c) discharging a mixture of the two gaseous streams to form a third gaseous stream which is discharged from the discharge outlet at a third pressure, greater than the second pressure. The first gaseous stream is preferably a medium pressure (MP) or a high-pressure (HP) steam having a pressure greater than 5.0 bar gage, typically greater than 10 bar gage. The second gaseous stream is preferably low-pressure (LP) steam at a pressure of about 2.5 to 5.0 bar gage (that is, about 3.5 to 6 bar abs. or about 35 to 75 psig). The third pressure is a function of the first and second pressures and is typically between about 3 and 10 bar gage, preferably between about 4 and 9 bar gage, most preferably between 5 and 8 bar gage.</p>
    <p>A preferred embodiment further includes (d) monitoring the third pressure and controlling the first pressure in response to the monitoring of the third pressure. This is typically practiced using a conventional automated control loop.</p>
    <p>The third gaseous stream at the third pressure may be forwarded to other processes in the pulp mill as needed, including, to heat exchangers for heating other fluids, to a steam-phase digester as the source of steam, to a condenser to improve the efficiency of the evaporators, to one or more batch digesters for heating,</p>
    <p>Another embodiment of the present invention comprises a system for treating hot spent cooking chemical to recover energy comprising: A source of hot spent cooking liquor. A flash tank having a hot liquid inlet operatively connected to the source of hot spent cooking liquor, a cooled liquid outlet, and a steam outlet. A jet ejector having a high-pressure inlet, a low-pressure inlet operatively connected to the steam outlet of the flash tank, and a discharge for mixed steam. A source of pressurized fluid operatively connected to the high-pressure inlet of the jet ejector. And, means for using the mixed steam discharged from the jet ejector operatively connected to the discharge of the jet ejector.</p>
    <p>The source of spent cooking chemical is preferably a chemical digestion process as described above. The flash tank is preferably a conventional flash tank as described in the above reference patents and provided by Ahistrom Machinery Inc. of Glens Falls, N.Y. The jet ejector is preferably a conventional ejector or “thermocompressor” which can handle the temperatures, pressures described above. One preferred thermocompressor is a Graham Thermocompressor manufactured by Graham Manufacturing of Batavia, N.Y., though comparable thermocompressors, eductors, or jet ejectors may be used. The thermocompressor is preferably made from steel, preferably stainless steel, for example, 300-series stainless steel or its equivalent.</p>
    <p>The source of pressurized fluid is any source typically available in a pulp mill, for example, low-pressure steam, medium-pressure steam, or high-pressure steam as described above. This steam may be “fresh” steam and/or “clean” steam.</p>
    <p>The means for using the mixed steam discharged from the jet ejector may be any steam utilization device or process available in the pulp or paper mill. Some preferred uses include for steaming of wood chips and the like in chip bins or steaming vessels; heating in direct or indirect heat exchangers, for example, in cooking circulation associated with a digester; in steam-phase digesters as the source of steam; or the like.</p>
    <p>The system may also include means for cooling the hot liquor positioned between the source of hot liquor and the flash tank for cooling the hot liquor prior to introducing it into the flash tank. The cooling means may be one or more direct or indirect heat exchangers, or any other conventional equipment capable of performing the cooling function. One preferred heat exchanger is an Extraction Liquor Cooler provided by Ahistrom Machinery Inc. (though any conventional heat exchanger can be used), which heat exchanger is typically provided with a source of cooling medium, for example, liquors related to the cooking process as described above.</p>
    <p>The present invention may also include two or more flash tanks having high-pressure liquid inlets, low-pressure liquid outlets, and steam outlets. A jet ejector may be positioned in one or more of the steam outlets of the flash tanks. In a preferred embodiment, the invention includes a plurality of flash tanks and the jet ejector is positioned in the steam outlet of the last or final flash tank. When a plurality of jet ejectors are used with a plurality of flash tanks one or more sources of steam may be used as the motive fluid in the one or more jet ejectors. For example, medium-pressure steam (e.g. about 12 bar abs.) may be used as the motive fluid in a first ejector and low-pressure steam (e.g. about 4.5 bar abs.) may be used for another second ejector. The mixed higher-pressure steam discharged from the first ejector may be forwarded to means for using the steam (e.g., a digester feed system steaming vessel), and the mixed lower-pressure steam from the second ejector may be forwarded to another means for using the steam (e.g., the chip bin of a digester feed system). The two or more ejectors may be provided with the same source of motive fluid (e.g., medium-pressure steam at 12 bar abs. or low pressure steam at about 5 bar abs.) The steam provided may be “fresh” steam and/or “clean” steam. Also, the steam discharged from the steam outlet of one flash tank may also provide the motive fluid introduced to the high-pressure inlet of one of the one or more jet ejectors. The present invention may also include one or more heat exchangers located upstream of each of the plurality of flash tanks.</p>
    <p>It is the primary object of the present invention to enhance the amount of steam produced from flash tanks in a conventional chemical pulping process and/or decrease the amount and temperature of spent cooking liquor discharged from a flash tank, and/or increase the concentration of the black liquor discharged from a flash tank in a chemical pulping system, and/or to increase the pressure of a low pressure steam flow in a pulp mill, all in a simple yet effective manner. This and other objects of the invention will become clear from an inspection of the detailed description of the invention and from the appended claims.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading> <p>FIG. 1 illustrates a cross-section of a typical jet ejector that can be used to implementing the present invention. A jet ejector is often also referred to as a “thermocompressor”, but the term “ejector” will be used throughout this discussion. The ejector <b>10</b> typically comprises or consists of a substantially cylindrical housing <b>11</b> having a high-pressure inlet (or motive fluid inlet) <b>12</b>, a low-pressure inlet (or suction inlet) <b>13</b>, and a discharge (or mixed fluid outlet) <b>14</b>. As is typical, the high pressure inlet <b>12</b> passes the high pressure fluid (for example, steam) to a venturi nozzle <b>15</b> which increases the velocity of the fluid while, due to the principles of Bernoulli, reducing its pressure. The reduced pressure draws the low pressure fluid into the low pressure inlet <b>13</b> so that the low pressure fluid is mixed with the high pressure fluid as they pass through the venturi nozzle <b>15</b>. The mixed fluid of intermediate pressure is discharged from the discharge or outlet <b>14</b>.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 2 and 3 schematically show representative examples how the steam jet ejector of FIG. 1 could be utilized to produce more flashed steam, or increase low pressure (LP) steam pressure, in a chemical pulp mill. FIG. 2 illustrates the simplest embodiment <b>20</b> of the present invention in which an ejector <b>21</b> is used to increase the output of steam from a conventional flash tank <b>22</b>. As is conventional, spent cooking liquor <b>23</b> containing dissolved products of the pulping reaction and spent cooking chemical is removed from a cooking vessel, or digester, either a continuous or batch digester, and treated to recover energy before regenerating the cooking chemical via recausticization. The spent cooking chemical, or “kraft black liquor” as it is known in the art, typically is pressurized at a pressure ranging from about 5 to 15 bar abs. and at a temperature reflective of the cooking treatment temperature, that is, between about 110 to 180° C. The black liquor <b>23</b> may undergo some cooling, for example, by passing it through a heat exchanger prior to being introduced to the flash tank <b>22</b>.</p>
    <p>The flash tank <b>22</b> is of substantially conventional construction having an inlet <b>24</b> for hot, pressurized black liquor <b>23</b>, a flashed steam outlet <b>25</b>, and a cooled, reduced pressure black liquor outlet <b>26</b>. Flash tanks are typically operated at a pressure lower than the pressure of the black liquor <b>23</b> introduced to the flash tank, typically between about 1 to 4 bar abs. Flash tanks are specially-designed vessels which permit the depressurization of hot, pressurized black liquor which causes rapid evaporation (or “flashing”) of the liquid, typically water, to steam so that the concentration of the resulting spent cooking chemical and products of the digestion reaction (that is, the “dissolves solids content”) of the liquid is increased. The steam produced by this rapid evaporation is discharged from steam outlet <b>25</b> into a conduit <b>27</b>, at the prevailing pressure of the tank <b>22</b>, for example between about 1 to 4 bar abs., at the saturation temperature corresponding to the prevailing pressure, for example, between about 100° to 140° C. In the conventional art, this steam, which is typically not “clean” steam since it was flashed from “unclean” liquid, is typically forwarded to the feed system of the digester to provide the source of steam for steaming of wood chips to be treated in the digester. The residual liquid remaining after flashing, also typically at a temperature of between about 100° and 140° C., settles to the bottom of the tank <b>22</b> and is discharged from outlet <b>26</b> into a conduit <b>28</b>. This residual liquid is typically passed to an evaporator system, with or without passing through one or more further flash tanks, to recover further energy and produce further steam. As disclosed in co-pending application Ser. No. 08/420,730 filed on Apr. 10, 1995 (attorney docket 10-1054), the hot liquor in conduit <b>27</b> may also be passed in heat exchange relationship with “clean” water in a reboiler to generate “clean” steam containing little or no sulfur-bearing compounds that can be used elsewhere as needed. Typical flash tank constructions are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,551,198 and 5,669,948.</p>
    <p>In the preferred embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 2, the steam in conduit <b>27</b> is passed via conduit <b>29</b> into the low-pressure inlet <b>30</b> of jet ejector <b>21</b>. At the same time steam <b>31</b> is introduced to the high-pressure inlet <b>32</b> of ejector <b>21</b>. The two sources of steam are mixed in the ejector <b>21</b> and the mixture is discharged from the outlet <b>33</b> into conduit <b>34</b> at a higher pressure than the pressure of the steam discharged from flash tank <b>22</b>. The steam in conduit <b>34</b> is passed to conduit <b>35</b> and used as needed, for example, for the steaming of incoming wood chips. The pressure required in the steam in conduit <b>35</b> is typically dictated by the pressure requirements of the eventual use of the steam in conduit <b>35</b>, for example, for chip steaming. However, according to the present invention, increasing the pressure of the steam in conduit <b>27</b> (by using the ejector <b>21</b>) to the pressure of the steam in conduit <b>35</b> (the desired pressure) permits the steam in conduit <b>27</b> (that is, the steam produced by the flash tank) to be generated at a lower pressure. Thus, the flash tank <b>22</b> may be operated at a lower pressure which, according to the invention, permits the flash tank to produce more <b>3</b>team while reducing the temperature of the steam and reducing the temperature of the residual spent liquor discharged from the flash tank into conduit <b>28</b>. Further details of the specific steam temperatures and pressures that can be generated using the invention of FIG. 2 will be discussed below.</p>
    <p>As also shown in FIG. 2, the flow of steam, for example, low pressure (LP) steam (though any available steam source may be used), may be regulated by valve <b>36</b> which in turn is controlled by a Pressure-indicator-controller (PIC) <b>37</b>. PIC <b>37</b> typically receives a control signal <b>38</b> from pressure sensor <b>39</b> located on flash tank <b>22</b>. The pressure of the steam in tank <b>22</b> is also typically the pressure of the steam introduced to the low pressure inlet <b>30</b> of ejector <b>21</b>. The flow of steam through valve <b>36</b> and to the high-pressure inlet <b>32</b> of ejector <b>21</b> is regulated depending upon the pressure of the steam introduced to the low pressure inlet <b>30</b>. As the pressure to the low-pressure inlet <b>30</b> decreases, the flow of steam to the high pressure inlet <b>32</b> is decreased to maintain a desired pressure in flash tank <b>22</b>.</p>
    <p>The flow of higher pressure steam from conduit <b>35</b> to conduit <b>27</b> may be regulated by valve <b>40</b> in conduit <b>41</b>. This feedback of high pressure gas to the low-pressure inlet of ejector <b>21</b> can sometimes be used to optimize the performance and efficiency of the ejector. Valve <b>40</b> may also be opened to bypass the ejector <b>21</b>. However, valve <b>40</b> is typically closed.</p>
    <p>FIG. 3 illustrates another embodiment of a system <b>50</b> according to the present invention. In this embodiment, a jet ejector <b>51</b> is used to raise the pressure of lower pressure gas, typically steam, in conduit <b>52</b> with the pressure of a higher pressure gas, again, typically steam, in conduit <b>53</b>. As shown in FIG. 3, the lower pressure gas (e.g. steam) in conduit <b>52</b> (e.g. from a flash tank, or another source) is introduced to the low-pressure inlet <b>67</b> of ejector <b>51</b> and the higher pressure gas in conduit <b>53</b> is introduced to the high-pressure inlet <b>54</b> of ejector <b>51</b>. The resulting gas, again, typically steam, at an intermediate pressure, (having a pressure higher than the pressure of the gas in conduit <b>52</b>) is discharged from outlet <b>55</b> of ejector <b>51</b> into conduit <b>56</b>. The gas in conduit <b>56</b> may be used wherever needed in the pulp mill, for example, as a source of steam in a heat exchanger, or as a source of steam for chip steaming, or as a source of steam for steam-phase treatment in a digester, among others.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 3, the flow of steam, for example, high-pressure (HP) steam, though any available steam source may be used, may be regulated by valve <b>57</b> which may be regulated by a conventional Pressure-indicator-controller (PIC) <b>58</b>. PIC <b>58</b> typically receives a control signal <b>59</b> from pressure sensor <b>181</b> located on conduit <b>56</b>. The flow of steam through valve <b>57</b> and to the high-pressure inlet <b>54</b> of ejector <b>51</b> is regulated depending upon the pressure of the steam discharged from the outlet <b>55</b>. As the pressure in the discharge conduit <b>56</b> decreases, the flow of steam to the high pressure inlet <b>54</b> is increased to maintain a desired discharge pressure in conduit <b>56</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 4 is a schematic representation of a typical prior art system <b>60</b> having a flash tank <b>61</b> used for flashing one or more conventional extractions <b>62</b> from a digester <b>65</b> at a typical temperature (about 150° C.) to produce more flash steam <b>63</b> and black liquor <b>64</b> at a lower temperature. For example, the hot, pressurized extraction liquor <b>62</b> at a temperature of about 150° C. and a pressure of about 1.5 to 15 bar abs. is introduced to flash tank <b>61</b> operated at about 1.2 bar abs. The resulting steam discharged to conduit <b>63</b> has a temperature of about 107° C. and a pressure of about 1.2 bar abs. and is forwarded to steaming of wood chips in the feed system of the digester. The resulting cooled, concentrated, black liquor in conduit <b>64</b> also has a temperature of about 107° C. and a pressure of about 1.2 bar abs. and is typically forwarded to the black liquor recovery system, typically including evaporators.</p>
    <p>FIG. 5 is a schematic representation of a conventional prior art system <b>70</b> having a flash tank <b>71</b> like that of FIG. 4 only utilizing a conventional extraction liquor cooler (ELC) <b>72</b>, which comprises a heat exchanger that reduces the temperature of the extraction in conduit <b>73</b> from the digester (such as a continuous kraft digester) while simultaneously heating cool liquids in conduit <b>74</b> that are to be supplied to the digester, and also schematically illustrating that the flash steam in conduit <b>75</b> for steaming is combined with fresh steam in conduit <b>76</b> to steam the chips, or other comminuted cellulosic fibrous material, such as in a steaming vessel or chip bin (not shown). In this case the hot extraction liquor in conduit <b>73</b> at about 150° C. and about 1.5 to 20 bar abs. (typically 8 to 16 bar abs.) is cooled by ELC <b>72</b> to about 120° C. with little or no loss in pressure and discharged to conduit <b>77</b>. The cooling medium in conduit <b>74</b>, typically, cooking chemical, such as kraft white, green, or black liquor, or dilution liquor or filtrate (for example, cold blow filtrate, washer filtrate or bleach plant filtrate) at about 80° C. is heated in the ELC <b>72</b> to about 135° C. and discharged to conduit <b>78</b>. This heated liquid in conduit <b>78</b> can be used as needed in the digester, for example, for cooking chemical in a cooking circulation or as dilution in circulation where Lo-Solids® cooking is practiced, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,489,363; 5,536,366; 5,547,012; 5,575,890; 5,620,562; 5,662,775; 5,824,188; 5,849,150; 5,849,151; and others.</p>
    <p>In the prior art embodiment of FIG. 5, the cooler extraction liquor in conduit <b>77</b> is flashed in flash tank <b>71</b> to produce steam in conduit <b>75</b> and cooled liquid in conduit <b>79</b> at a pressure of about 1.2 bar and a temperature of about 107° C. The liquor in conduit <b>79</b> is forwarded onto recovery, for example, via further flash tanks and evaporators. The flashed steam in conduit <b>75</b> is forwarded to chip steaming or other substantially conventional uses. The steam in conduit <b>75</b> may typically be supplemented by fresh steam introduced via conduit <b>76</b> at a temperature of about 155° C. and a pressure of about 4.5 bar.</p>
    <p>FIG. 6 is a schematic illustration of the system <b>80</b> similar to the system <b>70</b> of FIG. 5 only utilizing a steam ejector <b>81</b> according to the present invention to increase the temperature and pressure of the flash steam produced. The system <b>80</b> shown in FIG. 6 includes the essentially identical extraction liquor cooler <b>72</b>, having the same extraction liquor with the same temperature (i.e., about 150° C.) at the same pressure (i.e., about 1.5-10 bar abs.) in conduit <b>73</b>, the same cooling medium at the same temperature (i.e., about 80° C.) in conduit <b>74</b>, the same heated liquid at the same temperature (i.e., about 135° C.) in conduit <b>78</b>, the same cooler black liquor at the same temperature (i.e., about 120° C.) in conduit <b>77</b>, and essentially the same flash tank <b>71</b> shown in FIG. <b>5</b>. The system of FIG. 6 also includes the same source of fresh steam in conduit <b>76</b> as was shown in FIG. 5 having essentially the same temperature (i.e., about 155° C.) and pressure (i.e., about 4.5 bar abs.) as the system shown in FIG. <b>5</b>.</p>
    <p>The system of FIG. 6 is distinct from that of FIG. 5 in that the steam in conduit <b>76</b> (which may not be fresh steam, but any source of available steam) is directed to the high pressure inlet of conventional ejector <b>81</b> (as in FIG. 1) and the steam outlet from flash tank <b>71</b> communicates with the low-pressure inlet of ejector <b>81</b> via conduit <b>82</b>, the steam in conduit <b>82</b> for this example at a temperature of about 95° C. and a pressure of about 0.8 bar abs. The mixture of steam discharged from the ejector <b>81</b> into conduit <b>83</b> has a temperature of about 102° C. and a pressure of about 1.1 bar abs. As a result, the ejector <b>81</b> under the motive pressure of the steam in conduit <b>76</b> induces a pressure reduction in the low-pressure outlet of ejector <b>81</b> such that a vacuum is produced in conduit <b>82</b> and in flash tank <b>71</b> specifically, a subatmospheric pressure of about 0.8 bar abs. At this lower pressure, that is, lower than the prior art flash tank pressure of about 1.2 bar abs. as shown in FIG. 5, the hot liquor introduced to flash tank <b>71</b> via conduit <b>77</b> (at about 120° C. and greater than 1.5 bar abs.) flashes to a lower temperature and produces more steam and a cooler liquor in the flash tank <b>71</b>. In the example shown in FIG. 6, at a pressure of about 0.8 bar abs., the liquor in conduit <b>77</b> flashes to about 95° C. and the cooler liquor discharged from the flash tank <b>71</b> into conduit <b>84</b> is cooled to about 95° C. (compared with the about 107° C. shown in the prior art of FIG. <b>5</b>). Furthermore, compared to the prior art system shown in FIG. 5, more flashed steam is produced by flash tank <b>71</b> in FIG. 6 than flash tank <b>71</b> in FIG. 5, typically, at least about 10% more steam, possibly as much as about 20-40% more steam. As a result, the present invention using the same source of black liquor <b>73</b> and the same supply of steam <b>76</b> produces more steam in conduit <b>83</b> and cooler liquor in conduit <b>84</b> than the prior art.</p>
    <p>FIG. 7 is a view like that of FIG. 4 only showing a system <b>90</b> using a steam ejector <b>91</b> to decrease the temperature and pressure of the flashed steam in conduit <b>92</b>.</p>
    <p>The system <b>90</b> of FIG. 7 of the present invention does not include an ELC <b>72</b> as shown in FIG. <b>6</b>. The flash tank <b>61</b> of the system <b>90</b> in FIG. 7 receives an essentially identical supply of hot extraction liquor from a digester in conduit <b>62</b> at essentially the same temperature (i.e., about 150° C.) and pressure (i.e., 8-15 bar abs.) as the flash tank <b>61</b> of FIG. <b>4</b>. However, according to the present invention, the steam discharge conduit <b>92</b> of FIG. 4 communicates directly with the low-pressure inlet of jet ejector <b>91</b>. The high-pressure inlet of ejector <b>91</b> also receives a supply of higher pressure steam via conduit <b>95</b> at about 155° C. and about 4.5 bar abs. The mixture of gases is discharged from the ejector <b>91</b> to conduit <b>93</b> at a temperature of about 103° C. and a pressure of about 1.1 bar abs. Similar to the system shown in FIG. 6, the ejector <b>91</b> of FIG. 7 produces a pressure in conduit <b>92</b> and in flash tank <b>61</b> of about 1.0 bar abs. (that is, a pressure lower than the about 1.2 bar abs. of the prior art system shown in FIG. <b>4</b>). As a result, the hot liquor in conduit <b>62</b> introduced to flash tank <b>61</b> flashes to produce more steam at a temperature of about 102° C. (in conduit <b>92</b>) and the resulting cooler liquor discharged from the flash tank <b>61</b> via conduit <b>94</b> has a lower temperature of 102° C. (that is, again, lower than the 107° C. temperature of the liquid produced in conduit <b>64</b> if the prior art system shown in FIG. <b>4</b>). Again, clearly, even without an extraction liquor cooler (ELC), the present invention produces more steam and a cooler liquor than the prior art.</p>
    <p>FIG. 8 is a schematic view of an exemplary prior art system <b>100</b> where a plurality of flash tanks <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b> are used in association with the extraction from a digester in conduit <b>104</b> (e.g. at a temperature of about 160°). As is typical of the prior art, FIG. 8 illustrates a step-wise progression of pressure relief and steam generation. For example, for the system shown, hot extraction liquor in conduit <b>104</b> from a digester is first expanded at 3.5 bar abs. in flash tank <b>101</b> to produce steam in conduit <b>105</b> at about 140° C. and about 3.5 bar abs. and liquor in conduit <b>106</b> at about 140° C. The steam in conduit <b>105</b> is used where needed, for example, in a heat exchanger for heating a liquid or to the steam treatment of chips. The cooler liquor in conduit <b>106</b> is forwarded to flash tank <b>102</b> where it is again flashed but to a pressure of 2.4 bar abs. This produces a steam flow in conduit <b>107</b> at about 128° C. and about 2.4 bar and a liquor flow in conduit <b>108</b> at about 128° C. and about 2.4 bar. Again, the steam in conduit <b>107</b> is used as needed, for example, for the steaming of wood chips in a steaming vessel. The cooler liquor in conduit <b>108</b> is again flashed but to a pressure of about 1.2 bar and a temperature of about 107° C. in flash tank <b>103</b>, those conditions prevailing in conduit <b>109</b>. The steam in conduit <b>109</b> is again used and forwarded as needed, for example, to chip steaming in a chip bin or steaming vessel, or passed to a steam condenser for recovery of the condensate. The coolest liquor in conduit <b>110</b>, unless flashed further, is forwarded to the black liquor recovery operation. As a result, the system of FIG. 8 produces three sources of steam (in conduits <b>105</b>, <b>107</b>, <b>109</b>) at varying pressure and a cooler liquor (in conduit <b>110</b>) at about 107° C. from an initial supply of spent cooking liquor (in conduit <b>104</b>) at about 160° C.</p>
    <p>FIG. 9 is a schematic illustration of a system <b>120</b> like the system <b>100</b> of FIG. 8 but having a jet ejector <b>121</b> and utilizing an extraction liquor cooler (ELC, an indirect heat exchanger) <b>122</b> before the extraction liquor in conduit <b>123</b> from the digester is flashed, and utilizing the steam ejector <b>121</b> to increase the temperature and pressure of the flash steam from the last (<b>133</b>) of the series of flash tanks. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 9, the spent digester extraction liquor in conduit <b>123</b>, at about 160° C. and a pressure of between about 1.5 to 10 bar abs., is optionally first passed in indirect heat-exchange relationship in ELC <b>122</b> with a cooler (e.g. about 80° C.) liquid in conduit <b>124</b> to produce a heated liquid in conduit <b>125</b>. The cooler liquid in conduit <b>124</b> is typically cooking chemical, such as kraft white, green, or black liquor, or dilution liquor or filtrate (for example, cold blow filtrate, washer filtrate or bleach plant filtrate) at about 80° C. This cooler liquid in conduit <b>124</b> is heated in the ELC <b>122</b> to about 140° C. and discharged to conduit <b>125</b>. The heated liquid in conduit <b>125</b> can be used as needed in the pulp mill, for example, for cooking chemical in a cooking circulation or as dilution in a circulation where Lo-Solids® cooking is practiced, as described in the U.S. patents listed above. The cooled extraction liquid is discharged from ELC <b>122</b> with little or no pressure loss to conduit <b>126</b> at a temperature of about 135° C.</p>
    <p>The liquid in conduit <b>126</b> is introduced to the first flash tank <b>127</b> which, in the embodiment shown, operates at a pressure of about 2.4 bar abs. The resulting flashed steam in conduit <b>128</b> and cooled liquor in conduit <b>129</b> have a temperature of about 128° C. The steam in conduit <b>128</b> (at a pressure of about 2.4 bar abs) may be used as needed in the pulp mill, for example, for steaming wood chips in a steaming vessel or chip bin or for heating other fluids. The liquid in conduit <b>129</b> is forwarded to the second flash tank <b>130</b>, which, in this embodiment, operates at about 1.2 bar abs. and produces steam in conduit <b>131</b> and liquid in conduit <b>132</b> at about 107° C. The steam in conduit <b>131</b> (at a pressure of about 1.2 bar abs) may be used as needed in the pulp mill, for example, for steaming wood chips in a steaming vessel or chip bin or for heating other fluids. The liquid in conduit <b>132</b> is forwarded to the third (and in this embodiment last) flash tank <b>133</b>.</p>
    <p>According to the present invention, flash tank <b>133</b> is operated at a reduced pressure and temperature, for example, 0.7 bar abs. and 92° C., since the steam outlet of flash tank <b>133</b> communicates with the low-pressure steam inlet of ejector <b>121</b> via conduit <b>134</b>. The steam in conduit <b>134</b> is also at about 92° C. and 0.7 bar. Jet ejector <b>121</b> receives its motive fluid via conduit <b>136</b>. In the embodiment shown, the motive fluid in line <b>136</b> is fresh steam at about 155° C. and about 4.5 bar, though other sources of steam may be used, including “unclean” steam. The steam mixed in ejector <b>121</b> is discharged at a temperature of about 102° C. and a pressure of about 1.1 bar abs. into conduit <b>137</b>. The liquor discharged from flash tank <b>133</b> to conduit <b>135</b> is also at a temperature of about 92° C. Thus, compared to the prior art system <b>100</b> shown in FIG. 8, the system <b>120</b> of the present invention shown in FIG. 9 produces more steam at a lower temperature and pressure in conduit <b>137</b> and less (and more concentrated) liquor at a cooler temperature in conduit <b>135</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 10 is a schematic illustration of an embodiment <b>140</b> like that of FIG. 9 only utilizing a steam ejector <b>141</b> for the second flash tank <b>130</b> also. Since most of the structures shown in FIG. 10 are identical to those shown in FIG. 9, the same identifying reference numbers are used in FIG. 10 as were used in FIG. <b>9</b>. Where the temperatures or pressures differ from those in FIG. 9, they are shown.</p>
    <p>FIG. 11 is a schematic illustration of another embodiment <b>150</b> according to the invention in which two flash tanks are used and an ejector <b>153</b> is associated with the second flash tank <b>152</b>. System <b>150</b> includes a first flash tank <b>151</b>, a second flash tank <b>152</b> and a jet ejector <b>153</b>. Similar to the earlier embodiments, a stream of hot digester extraction liquor (e.g., at about 160° C.) is introduced to the high-pressure liquid inlet of flash tank <b>151</b> via conduit <b>154</b>. (A cooling heat exchanger may be located in this conduit as described above.) In this embodiment, flash tank <b>151</b> is operated at a pressure of about 2.4 bar abs. and a temperature of about 128° C. As a result, the hot black liquor in conduit <b>154</b> flashes to produce steam at about this temperature and pressure in line <b>155</b>, and a cooler liquor at about this temperature and pressure in line <b>156</b>. The steam generated is discharged from the steam outlet of flash tank <b>151</b> into conduit <b>155</b>. The steam in conduit <b>155</b> is forwarded to, for example, a steaming vessel to steam chips prior to digestion. The cooled liquor in flash tank <b>151</b> is discharged from the low-pressure liquor outlet into conduit <b>156</b>.</p>
    <p>The liquor in conduit <b>156</b>, at about 2.4 bar abs. and about 128° C., is forwarded to the high-pressure inlet of the second flash tank <b>152</b>. Flash tank <b>152</b> is operated at a pressure of about 0.9 bar and a temperature of about 98° C. Again, according to this invention, flash tank <b>152</b> can operate at this subatmospheric pressure due to the vacuum created by ejector <b>153</b> operatively connected thereto. The steam flashed from the liquor in conduit <b>156</b> is discharged from flash tank <b>152</b> via conduit <b>157</b> and is drawn into the low-pressure inlet of ejector <b>153</b>. The cooled black liquor in flash tank <b>152</b> is discharged from the low-pressure outlet into conduit <b>158</b>. Though the liquor in conduit <b>158</b> (at about 98° C.) may be treated further, for example, further flashing or cooling, the liquor in conduit <b>158</b> is preferably forwarded to the evaporators of the black liquor recovery system.</p>
    <p>The steam in conduit <b>157</b> at about 0.9 bar abs and about 98° C. is mixed in ejector <b>153</b> with higher pressure steam supplied to the high-pressure inlet of ejector <b>153</b> via conduit <b>159</b>. In the embodiment shown the higher pressure steam in conduit <b>159</b> is “low-pressure” fresh steam having a pressure of about 4.5 bar abs. and a temperature of about 155° C. The mixed gases are discharged from the ejector <b>153</b> at a pressure of about 1.1 bar (again, greater than the pressure in conduit <b>157</b>) and about 102° C. into conduit <b>160</b>. In this embodiment, the steam in conduit <b>160</b> is forwarded to a chip bin for steaming wood chips or the like, though the steam in conduit <b>160</b> may be used in other conventional ways, for example, in a heat exchanger.</p>
    <p>The present inventions illustrated in FIGS. <b>6</b>,<b>7</b>, <b>9</b>-<b>11</b> may typically include automatic controls such as the P-I-C controller <b>37</b> shown in FIG. <b>2</b>.</p>
    <p>It is to be understood that in the above description the temperatures are indicated as approximate, and that there typically will be a range of at least 4-5° C. above or below each of the temperatures, and that the pressures are also approximate and there will typically be a range of at least 0.2 bar abs±the pressures indicated, and that the invention contemplates all narrower ranges within these broad ranges. The invention is particularly suited for the situation where an extraction liquor cooler is utilized with a digester, enhancing the economics of the use of a jet steam ejector. Flash tank pressure increased by a jet steam ejector is most beneficial when the total amount of flash steam is small but when it is necessary to use a large amount of steam for steaming.</p>
    <p>For all of the ranges given in the application, all smaller ranges within the broad range are specifically provided. For example, and example only, a temperature of 60-100 degrees means 75-90, 88-91, 60-93, and all other smaller ranges within the broad range.</p>
    <p>While the invention has been described in connection with what is presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the disclosed embodiment, but on the contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. The invention is to be accorded the broadest w interpretation possible consistent with the prior art.</p>
