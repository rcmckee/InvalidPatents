The reclosable bags <b>2001 </b>are made from base web material that has transversely applied fastener tape segments thereon. The web material is used in a vertical form, fill and seal bag forming method. The method includes the steps of supplying a continuous strip of tape, having male and female fasteners profiler across the web for sealing thereon. In one embodiment a continuous strip of barrier material, and a continuous strip of fastener having first and second interlocked fastener profile strips are positioned on the continuous strip of tape; and secured thereon, the barrier tape is folded to obtain a fold and two opposing barrier tape fastener strip connecting portions; and, the fold is slit to form two separate continuous strips of barrier material strips and two continuous strips of tape. In another embodiment a coating is applied to the tape itself to prevent sealing of the folded slit tape to itself. The resulting tape and fastener are cut <b>220 </b>and portioned properly on the web by the unique vacuum belt system of the present invention and by the interconnected tape drive, web drive and the connection to the form fill seal machine.</div>

    <p>This application claims priority from Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/022,353 filed Jul. 24, 1996; U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/036,186 filed Jan. 18, 1997, and U.S. Provisional Patents Application Ser. No. 60/035,051 filed Jan. 22, 1997 all invented by the present inventor, James R. Johnson.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>This invention relates generally to reclosable plastic bags and in particular to tape used in the manufacture of reclosable plastic bags, the web that the bags are made from, methods related to their manufacture, and an apparatus for manufacturing reclosable bags that is more efficient and economical than conventional methods and devices.</p>
    <p>While most packaging is done with polyethylene sheeting, or a polyethylene sealant layer if barrier sheeting is used, there are problems of sealing the intended sealant layer of the bag wall to reclosable profiles due to profile thicknesses, or due to the thicknesses of flange material that may be integral with the profile, even if the surfaces to be sealed are both polyethylene and compatible.</p>
    <p>There are even more complex problems when the sealant layer of the bag walls is something other than polyethylene, as the inside bag wall layer of oriented polypropylene sealant layer of potato chip bags. Sealing reclosable materials to this wall means using materials that are compatible. This invention gives a practical means to accomplish these results.</p>
    <p>U.S. Pat. No. 4,909,017, McMahon discloses the delivery of a pair of interlocked, profiled fasteners transversely across a web of film used in forming a plurality of bags. However, the system of McMahon is non-enabling in that fastener strips cannot be delivered as described therein.</p>
    <p>There is no attempt in the written description to describe how the narrow fastener strip can be fed, held and sealed onto the base web. The strip material would be unstable for sealing due to the rib and groove design, which would rock on center. The strip material is naturally curled from extrusion and distorted from being wound onto a spool. The difficulty of feeding this unstable strip cross web, remove curls and twists, stretch straight and hold for heat and pressure application between a seal bar and anvil makes this method chaotic and impractical.</p>
    <p>There are at least two other major shortcomings of the McMahon '017 patent. The first shortcoming involves the impossibility of making commercially acceptable seals of the bag walls to the backside of each fastener half in the bagger sealing jaws. The second shortcoming involves the window of registration required to seal the backside of the fastener to a finished bag wall during bagger cross sealing and the inability of known form fill seal and equipment to repeat the bagger film draw with the required accuracy.</p>
    <p>Specifically, the McMahon '017 patent describes a pressure bar seal in the bagger sealing jaws that seals the outer bag material precisely to the backside of the fastener profile. Yet, it has been discovered, as described in Applicant's specification, that a pressure bar seal requires a stable and flat surface to properly seal. The irregular shape of the fastener profile makes this impossible. One requires heat, dwell time, and pressure to effect a commercially acceptable seal and due to the irregular shape of the profile, it is impossible to get enough stable pressure to accomplish a commercially acceptable seal. The surface moves and gives unpredictably. If enough heat and pressure are applied for a sufficient dwell time to mash the base of the profile flat enough to seal, the profile hooks are softened and deformed, making it impossible to repeatedly use the completed bag for opening and reclosing.</p>
    <p>The McMahon '017 patent has an additional shortcoming related to sealing the seamed side of the bag to the opposite side of the fastener. Based on Applicant's knowledge and experience, this cannot be done to produce a commercially acceptable product. The fact is that no bagger can draw with the accuracy the McMahon '017 patent requires, to place the second seal, in register, on the back side of the fastener profiles.</p>
    <p>Another illustrative patent is U.S. Pat. No. 5,461,845 to Yeager. There are at least two definitive shortcomings therein. The first shortcoming relates to the problem of having to open the zipper completely from the front panel of the finished bag. Users of reclosable bags and packaging are accustomed to opening the profiled fastener from the “top” of the package, and not from the front panel of the package. Hence, the user will have to become accustomed to a method with which he may not be familiar or comfortable.</p>
    <p>The second shortcoming is more serious, and relates to the requirement of opening the package from the front panel thereof. If the package is to be opened from the front panel, a cut or perforation must be made before the fastener is applied. This cut, or perforation, is generally shaped like an “oval” with opening “tabs” for gaining access to the fastener. Since the fastener, most likely, is not closed at the ends of the fastener, the possibility of contamination exists.</p>
    <p>The most expedient and economical way to make the package is to create the cut, or perforation, in one operation, just upstream of the fastener strip application. This operation, in its simplest form, will leave openings for potential contamination to pass through the cut or perforated, front panel opening. To overcome this contamination potential, users of this method add a great deal more cost and complexity to create a sealed, sealable “patch”, or some other means of eliminating this contamination risk. The same problem occurs, if the package must be hermetically sealed.</p>
    <p>There is also a serious drawback of coextroding a flanged zipper having ribs on the inside of the flanges so that it is unsealable, when heat is applied to each bag wall side. The drawback is that a unitary extruded flanged zipper has a limitation as to thinness of the flanges that can be integrally extruded with reclosable profile. Further, use of co-extruded ribs to make the inside of the flanges not seal together increases the thickness of the flange area even more.</p>
    <p>This contrast in thickness of the 4 layers of material which includes the 2 bag walls and the 2 zipper flanges will make it virtually impossible to blend the cross seals through the 4 thickness area and into the 2 thickness area of the bag walls only. For example, if a 3 millimeter: i.e., “mils” wall bag is being made, the coextruded flange with ribs, will be 16 mils per side or 32 mils total. This would require a blending of 38 mils to 6 mils and would most likely eliminate the possibility of closing off openings in the folds of any bag made on a vertical FFS machine.</p>
    <p>Thus, there exists a need to solve the problems in the art that are articulated above.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to overcome the shortcomings of the prior art by providing a large skirt (tape) area which a second seal can be easily registered. The skirt (tape) height of the area could be changed, depending upon the bagger design, condition, and the variation in draw height of the bagger.</p>
    <p>It is another object of this invention to overcome the shortcomings of the art by using fastener profile mounted on tape in the bag forming process, and requiring that the operations involved sealing two flat, substantially parallel thin surfaces. Thus, there is no irregular surface that is sealed to attach the fastener to the front panel, or to carry the fastener through the bagger and down the form, fill and seal tube or to seal the back-seamed side of the package. It is also an object of the present invention to allow the customer/user of the package to open the package from the top, as he or she is accustomed.</p>
    <p>It is an additional object of the invention to treat the inside surface of the skirt (tape) area to prevent area from being sealed together in the process described below, to allow zipper and bag opening from this area.</p>
    <p>It is an additional, object of the invention to solve the shortcomings of the art through the use of fastener tape as described below, to provide a thin substantially flat, fastener appendage which is sealed to the bag wall(s) and to treat the inside layers of the fastener opening tabs, above the fastener.</p>
    <p>It is a further object of the invention to provide an automatic contamination-free package by sealing the fastener completely inside the package. In this variant, the top seal of the package must be cut off to allow the customer/user to get to the opening tabs of the fastener.</p>
    <p>It is a further object of the invention to provide improved control of web dispensing by using driven, dancered unwinding of the base web and indexing of the base web for zipper application positioning. The zipper application includes a servo motor and computerized motor controls.</p>
    <p>It is an additional object of the invention to provide unwinding, tensioning, guiding and indexing of the fastener tape materials in the attachment thereof to a web, linked to the indexing of web but independent thereof.</p>
    <p>It is a further object of the invention to obtain a balance of tensions between the fastener strip and tape material by providing a driven, dancered web for feeding folded and lightly-tensioned tape material to a fastener sealing device.</p>
    <p>It is yet a further object of the invention to obtain a flatter, straighter, curl-less fastener tape from the fastener tape operation by more accurately controlling the relative tensions of the webless fastener and the tape material during application of the fastener material to the tape.</p>
    <p>It is another object of the present invention to solve these and other problems in the art, and to serve a market that demands hundreds of millions of reclosable plastic bags annually. The objects and features of the present invention, other than those specifically set forth above, will become apparent in the detailed description of the invention set forth below and in the drawings.</p>
    <p>The invention also provides a method of making a reclosable bag having a body with top and bottom ends and opposing walls in a vertical, form, fill and seal machine that includes the steps of forming the bag walls from web material having a longitudinal back seal extending between the top and bottom ends of the bag body, and transversely securing across the longitudinal back seal a flange of a flanged, interlocked fastener strip. The flange is substantially wider than the width of the interlocked fastener strip attached to the flange. As such, it is appreciated that the sealer bars do not contact or deform the interlocked fastener strip during the sealing process. It is further appreciated that the method allows for a commercially acceptable seal to be made across the longitudinal back seal while providing greater tolerance for deviations in bagger web draw.</p>
    <p>The flange or tape is sized and dimensioned to provide a larger window of registration than that required to seal the backside of a conventional fastener onto a finished bag wall whether it is a back or front panel wall, directly onto the backside of the fastener during bagger cross sealing. The flange or tape is also sized and dimensioned to provide repeatable sealing of the tape or flange to the bag wall during the transverse bagger cross sealing process while allowing for variances and deviations in bagger web draw.</p>
    <p>The invention further includes an improved vertical, form, fill and seal process that includes transversely sealing a non-profiled, stable and substantially flat surfaced appendage or flange having a profiled, interlocked, reclosable fastener strip connected thereto across the longitudinally extending back seal of a bag during bagger cross sealing. It is appreciated that the transverse sealing across the non-profiled, stable and substantially flat surfaced appendage permits one to seal the appendage to bag material with an effective heat, dwell time, and pressure to effect a commercially acceptable seal without the surface moving and giving unpredictably. It is also appreciated that greater, pressure and dwell can be applied to mash the shape flat enough to seal, while simultaneously preventing the profiled fastener from softening and deforming making it possible to repeatedly use the completed bag for opening and reclosing.</p>
    <p>In a variant, as described above the invention provides a two piece tape or flange comprising a very thin, substantially flat, tape or flange portion connected to the zipper profiles to obtain a commercially acceptable flanged zipper. The very thin, substantially flat, tape or flange portion is preferably construct from web material of about 0.003″ in thickness that is very flexible. It is also possible to use tape materials in the range of about 0.003″ inches in thickness to as thin as 0.001″ in thickness. The preferred loop is a high loop of about 1.25″. By using a high loop it is possible to obtain enough stiffness in the combination tape/flange fastener profile assembly to push the assembly at the start of the transverse application process, and then attach the thin, flexible, wide loop quickly to a vacuum belt, so that it can be carried across the base web for positioning. Holding and transporting the flexible loop (or flange if the loop is split open) across the web is readily accomplished using a modest amount of vacuum. A printed barrier can be applied to the inside loop area to make it non-sealable, while adding very little to the thickness of the loop.</p>
    <p>The system method, and (tape or flange) assembly described above is extremely versatile. The tape or flange is substantially thin allowing its use with a greater variety of bag walls materials, regardless of the base web thickness. The tape or flange, since it is ribless and thin, blends the cross seals better, from tape plus bag wall thickness to bag wall thickness only, and results in continuous seals, sealed in the bagger sealing jaws.</p>
    <p>Further, the assembly described above is constructed to be readily, transversely “pulled” across a web of material, and the assembly method, and system can be used with any appropriate tape base material. As described above, the invention described above can be used on laminate bag wall base web material, e.g. snack food bag wall and base web material where a user does not want to change their present structure/bag wall material which would not seal to LDPE material. The preferred non-sealable treatment of the tape or flange is to provide a printed food grade nitro cellulose coating into the loop (flap) area. As such, the invention provides a two-piece fastener profile having each respective profile connected to a loop portion of a tape or flange in which the inside loop portion of the tape or flange is treated to be non-sealable, e.g. has a non-sealing inside surface.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading> <p>FIG. 1 is a schematic representation of system <b>120</b> of the present invention for sealing tape <b>100</b> to web <b>110</b>. The proper feeding, locating and sealing tape <b>100</b> at predetermined locations on base web <b>110</b> are important aspects of system <b>120</b>. System <b>120</b> is reliable and capable of repeatedly performing steps with high throughput and with low cycle times. The manner in which tape <b>100</b> is fed, and positioned for sealing onto base web <b>110</b> is critical to achieving accurate secure sealing of tape <b>100</b> to web <b>110</b>. To this end, base web <b>110</b> is indexed at indexing station <b>130</b>, via servo motor <b>140</b>. Servo motor <b>140</b> has control over acceleration, speed and deceleration of web <b>110</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 4, in an alternative embodiment, the movement of web <b>110</b> in the direction of the arrow <b>112</b> in FIG. 1 creates air movement over web <b>110</b> affecting anything that is attempted to be passed over it, such as tape <b>100</b>. The tendency is to pull the leading edge of tape <b>100</b> in the direction of the movement of base web <b>110</b>. Tape <b>100</b>, which is generally about 1Δ to 2¾″ wide, effectively floats on current of air (not shown). At the end of the tape delivery <b>190</b>, tape <b>100</b> is in a stretched position <b>320</b> across web <b>110</b>, assuring squareness for positioning onto base web <b>110</b>. By “pinning” or staking tape <b>100</b> at a stretched corner, then pinning or staking it at a corner at the opposite end of tape <b>100</b>, sealing can be accomplished with tape <b>100</b> square and in register with base web <b>110</b>. Seal <b>280</b> is transverse to web <b>110</b> and parallel to the fastener that is attached to tape <b>100</b>.</p>
    <p>In the alternative embodiment, it has been determined that the following sequence of steps rapidly and accurately feeds, positions and seals tape <b>100</b> onto web <b>110</b>:</p>
    <p>1. Driving tape <b>100</b> forward using a set of zipper grooved rubber nip rollers <b>150</b> connected to stepping motor <b>160</b> at stepping station <b>170</b>.</p>
    <p>2. Carrying tape <b>100</b> transversely across web <b>110</b> with a curtain or stream <b>180</b> of air directed above and below tape <b>100</b> material from air supply <b>105</b>, so as to eliminate the influence of base web <b>110</b>, which is moving concurrently beneath tape <b>100</b> and at a right angle thereto.</p>
    <p>3. Stopping the air current or curtain of air <b>180</b> at delivery end station <b>190</b>, and concurrently pinning loop side corner <b>200</b> of tape <b>100</b> to base web <b>110</b> (FIG. 1) before the tape <b>100</b> is chopped or cutoff at cutting station <b>210</b>.</p>
    <p>4. Pinning the tape <b>100</b> material at opposite end <b>230</b> (FIG. 4) at cut <b>220</b> is being made and, holding the tape <b>100</b> material in position to be sealed at positioning station <b>240</b> with pinning devices <b>260</b>.</p>
    <p>5. Sealing single lip <b>250</b> to base web <b>110</b> with a sealing device, (e.g. fastener segment attachment assembly <b>2101</b>), while pinning deices <b>260</b> continue to hold severed tape piece <b>270</b> (FIGS. 1 and 4) in position, substantially square with base web <b>110</b>.</p>
    <p>6. Continuing to hold the tape with pinning devices <b>260</b> while the seal bar lifts away from the sealing position, effectively allowing the sealing bar to strip away from the seal.</p>
    <p>7. Releasing pinning devices <b>260</b> (Pinning devices <b>260</b> include pneumatically operated rubber boots <b>310</b>, which are generally about 1″ square).</p>
    <p>It has been determined that the following sequence of steps rapidly and accurately feeds, locates, cuts and seals tape <b>100</b> onto web <b>110</b>.</p>
    <p>1. Controlled by the level of take up dancer arm <b>520</b>, a signal to index base web <b>110</b> and index tape <b>100</b> is given.</p>
    <p>2. A servomotor <b>469</b> drives the tape <b>100</b> forward via the nip drive <b>470</b> of Tape Drive Assembly D-23587. (<b>2107</b>)</p>
    <p>3. The leading edge of the tape <b>100</b> is driven into the vacuum belt <b>2132</b> in Vacuum Drive Assembly D-23625 (<b>2167</b>). Vacuum openings <b>2049</b>A in the belt <b>2132</b> attach to the skirt area above the zipper <b>980</b> tape <b>100</b>. The Vacuum belt <b>2132</b> is driven slightly faster than nip drive <b>470</b> roller surfaces <b>2113</b>-<b>17</b> and carries the leading edge of the tape <b>100</b> to its farthermost position in a stretched manner.</p>
    <p>4. After driving the tape <b>100</b> the distance desired, the Tape Cutter Assembly C-23695 (<b>2109</b>) is activated to clamp and cut tape <b>100</b>.</p>
    <p>5. As the cutter <b>2109</b> clears to return to its uppermost position, the leading edge of the next piece of tape <b>100</b>, is lifted clear of the cutting slot <b>2129</b>A to avoid a potential jam on the next feed cycle and so as to be aimed properly for transference to the vacuum belt <b>2132</b>. Concurrently the cutting ledge moves clear to allow the trailing edge of the tape piece just cut to lay flat for sealing.</p>
    <p>6. The tape <b>100</b> is sealed to the base web <b>110</b> via the sealing bar which is part of Assembly D-23625. (<b>2167</b>) The sealing bar <b>2159</b> clears and the cycle is ready to be repeated. The trailing edge of the piece of tape <b>100</b> just attached to the base web <b>110</b> does not interfere with the lifted leading edge of the tape on next feed cycle due to the leading edge feeding over the trailing edge being pulled away in a transverse direction.</p>
    <p>7. Vacuum remains on and seal bond strength of tape <b>100</b> to base web <b>110</b> allows separation of the tape skirt (flange) <b>1070</b> from vacuum belt <b>2132</b> when the base web <b>2032</b>, <b>2154</b> indexes. This allows vacuum belt <b>2132</b> holding strength to remain constant continuously and prevents time delays to build up vacuum strength after being shut down.</p>
    <p>The invention also provides an apparatus <b>1140</b> and method for forming and driving web <b>340</b> (web <b>110</b> having tape <b>100</b> sealed thereto) downwardly along the outside of tube <b>350</b> (which is part of a vertical form, fill and seal machine), making back seal <b>360</b> and making cross seals <b>370</b>, <b>380</b>. Each end <b>230</b>, <b>235</b> of the severed tape piece <b>270</b> must be sealed in some manner, or the severed tape piece <b>270</b> will, simply, separate at its first opening and realignment will be very difficult. To solve this problem, the ends <b>230</b>, <b>235</b> of our zipper tape piece are “staked” ultrasonically.</p>
    <p>The invention further provides a device <b>400</b> for coordinating bagger <b>410</b> and tape applicator <b>420</b>. It is important to coordinate the operations of bagger <b>410</b> and the operations of tape applicator <b>420</b>, because uniform web tension must be maintained between these operations, or web tracking will be lost.</p>
    <p>As partially illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, assembly <b>430</b> is responsive to device <b>400</b> in one variant and delivers uniformly tensioned web <b>440</b> to bagger <b>410</b> and takes up the material being fed by the tape applicator <b>420</b>, while simultaneously maintaining good tension all the while. The three sections of assembly <b>430</b> are a spring loaded three loop dancer <b>490</b> with a photo sensor <b>460</b> which reads the position of the dancer <b>490</b> and, when ready, starts the cycle of tape <b>100</b> application; a nip drive <b>470</b>, for feeding the tape <b>100</b> (FIG. 29) and, a second three loop dancer <b>2136</b> (as shown in FIG. 29) between the nip drive <b>470</b> and the bagger <b>410</b> (FIG. 1) which controls the nip drive <b>470</b>.</p>
    <p>Indexing of the bagger <b>410</b> and indexing of the tape applicator <b>420</b> are independent. Bagger <b>410</b> indexes, causing the three loop dancer <b>490</b> to rise. A proximity switch (not shown) and a cam causes nip drive <b>470</b> to pull material <b>440</b>, thereby lowering arm <b>520</b> on the dancer <b>490</b>. When additional material <b>440</b> is pulled through the nip <b>470</b>, the upstream dancer arm <b>520</b> rises causing coils <b>510</b> in springs <b>521</b> to stretch, under tension. Photo sensor <b>460</b> then sees flag <b>570</b> on arm <b>550</b> of the dancer <b>490</b> , which causes tape applicator <b>420</b> to index. The coils <b>521</b> under tension pull arm <b>520</b> down to receive material <b>340</b> being indexed into three loop assembly <b>490</b>. The process is then continually repeated. As a light a tension as possible is used on the spring so that little resistance to the movement of the tape is applied, thereby reducing the tension on the tape and resistance to the inertia of the tape moving forward. As a result positioning of the tape is more accurate throughout the system.</p>
    <p>FIG. 3 illustrates a tape applicator program <b>580</b> that executes the following steps of the routine: <b>102</b>—Base web <b>110</b> indexes to eye spot <b>590</b>, via servo motor <b>140</b>; <b>202</b>—Tape <b>100</b> is fed, via stepping motor; <b>303</b>—vacuum belt <b>2132</b> carries tape <b>100</b> for positioning <b>404</b>—Tape <b>100</b> is cut, and sealed to base web <b>2032</b>, <b>2154</b>. <b>505</b>—Actuate seal <b>280</b> to seal tape <b>100</b> to base web <b>110</b>.</p>
    <p>Another aspect of the invention provides for an attachment of tape applicator <b>420</b> to a winder <b>600</b> (not shown). This allows bagger <b>410</b> to function with pre-applied tape. There exists substantial demand for zippered roll stock <b>630</b> with tape <b>100</b> already sealed onto base web <b>2154</b> to be run on separate baggers. This approach to zippered packaging is not a replacement for in-line capability, but can be used as another option.</p>
    <p>System <b>120</b> described above optionally feeds a winder (not shown), as well as bagger <b>410</b> with, practically, no modifications. In these cases, the packer or the converter could be the user of the equipment. This approach allows any converter to provide a customer-packer with preapplied zippered roll stock <b>630</b> enabling the converter to obtain base web business he would not ordinarily get. The packer runs preapplied zippered roll stock <b>630</b> for multiple baggers without having to provide tape applicator <b>420</b>.</p>
    <p>The invention also provides for methods of treating the internal loop or flap area <b>1060</b> of tape <b>100</b> to create a non-sealing characteristic thereof as illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 7. The inside surface of the loop or flap area <b>1060</b> of the tape <b>100</b> material is treated to make it not seal in bagger <b>410</b> during the jaw sealing process <b>1260</b>. In one variant, the inside loop area <b>1060</b> is treated to be non-sealable or, in another variant, the inside flap areas <b>1060</b> are treated to be non-sealable.</p>
    <p>There are several ways in which this is accomplished, including electronic surface (corona-style) treatment, non-sealable printing materials application, laminated, or sealed barrier (non-sealable) strip application onto tape <b>100</b> material between zipper halves, <b>720</b>, <b>730</b> and insertion of barrier (non-sealable) strip <b>740</b> into loop (flap) area <b>1060</b> (FIG. <b>8</b>).</p>
    <p>In one variant, as seen in FIG. 9, the invention includes frangible opening <b>750</b>, used when the product packaged does not require hermetic seals, such as IQF (instant quick freeze) vegetables and/or fruits. For items not requiring hermetic seals, such as IQF vegetables, where holes are punched to get air out of the bag and release CO<sub>2</sub>, frangible opening <b>750</b> is desirable as opposed to cutting a top seal <b>830</b> off with scissors.</p>
    <p>As illustrated in FIGS. 9-11, opening is created during tape <b>100</b> manufacturing. Top end <b>760</b> is slit open during manufacturing. The tape material <b>100</b> is constructed from a single-layer of polyethylene with additives such as ethylene vinyl acetate to facilitate sealing. The application of tape <b>100</b> results in a finished package <b>1</b> as depicted in FIG. <b>10</b>. The perforating operation to create frangible opening <b>750</b> is incorporated into the sealing jaws <b>1260</b> of the bagger <b>410</b>, which also seals the cross web tape loop <b>880</b> the top seal <b>830</b> and bottom seal (not shown) of the bag <b>1</b>.</p>
    <p>As illustrated in FIGS. 9-13, flanges <b>770</b>, <b>780</b> having fastener profiles <b>720</b>, <b>730</b> thereon are sealed to the inside walls <b>810</b>, <b>820</b>. Flanges <b>770</b>, <b>780</b> are sealed to walls <b>930</b>, <b>940</b> below top seal <b>830</b> at seals <b>790</b>, <b>800</b>. Frangible opening <b>750</b> is disposed below top seal <b>830</b> and above flange <b>780</b> (FIG. <b>10</b>).</p>
    <p>The invention further includes a process to make pre-applied zippered tape roll stock <b>630</b> (FIG. <b>5</b>). The tape <b>100</b> material is optionally applied in-line with the bagger operation. Preapplied zippered roll stock <b>630</b> is also provided by adding a winder, to the tape applicator <b>420</b> system <b>120</b>.</p>
    <p>The invention also includes variants for “chip” industry applications. The invention includes an “easy opening” feature for plastic bags. As shown in FIG. 12, chip bag <b>840</b> carries very thin sealant layer <b>850</b>, commonly about {fraction (2/10)} of a millimeter in thickness. Chip bag <b>840</b> includes a reclosable strip <b>860</b> just below separable opening portion <b>870</b>. Separation of the walls of opening portion <b>870</b> exposes reclosable opening flanges <b>770</b>, <b>780</b>, to the environment if the tape loop <b>760</b> (FIG. 9) is slit apart during its manufacture. FIG. 12 also illustrates the location of sealing bars <b>2159</b>. Sealing bars <b>2159</b> seal at least a flat, unprofiled portion of flanges <b>770</b>, <b>780</b> to the bag <b>840</b> walls.</p>
    <p>In a preferred embodiment, tape loop <b>880</b> is slit open during manufacturing. Inside surfaces <b>890</b>, <b>900</b> on flanges <b>770</b>, <b>780</b> (FIG. 13) are treated to be unsealable.</p>
    <p>Chip bag <b>840</b> is manufactured using the following steps: Outside surfaces <b>910</b>, <b>920</b> on flanges <b>770</b>, <b>780</b> include laminate surface sealant compatible with chip bag inside bag surfaces <b>930</b>, <b>940</b> (FIG. <b>13</b>).</p>
    <p>As depicted in FIG. 10, outside surfaces <b>910</b>, <b>920</b> of tape assembly <b>950</b> are sealed to chip bag inside wall surfaces <b>930</b>, <b>940</b>, respectively. Profiled reclosable strip <b>860</b> (FIG. 12) having zipper halves <b>720</b>, <b>730</b> are between flanges <b>770</b>, <b>780</b> in an interlocked arrangement. Top seal <b>830</b>FIG. 10 is formed from material used to make easy open chip bag <b>840</b> seals (FIG.<b>12</b>). Bottomseal (not shown) is formed concurrently.</p>
    <p>In the case where packaging material <b>960</b>, e.g. web stock, has a “different” sealant layer <b>970</b> from zipper <b>980</b>, a coextruded or laminate, tape material <b>1010</b> is applied to material <b>960</b> (FIGS. <b>14</b>-<b>15</b>). The fastener side <b>1005</b> contains compatible LDPE (low density polyethylene) surface <b>1000</b> and the opposite side <b>1020</b> is layered with material <b>1030</b> that is compatible with the sealant layer <b>970</b> of the packaging material <b>960</b>, such as a potato chip bag <b>840</b>. Opposite side <b>1020</b> is compatible with sealant layer <b>970</b> of packaging material <b>960</b>. Inside surface <b>1000</b> is constructed easy sealing to zipper <b>980</b>. The inside loop area <b>1060</b> is treated after zipper <b>980</b> is sealed in and cannot be sealed to itself. The outside surface <b>1030</b> remains sealable and compatible with the inside surface of packages, to effect the desired seal to the package. “Cut here” instructions or other indicia are provided so that the user can expose fastener <b>980</b> upon severance along the indicated lines (FIG. <b>15</b>).</p>
    <p>In yet another aspect, the invention provides an apparatus to make reclosable tape <b>1010</b> (FIG. 14) or flange zipper material <b>950</b> (FIG. 13) and wind it into rolls. In one variant, tape <b>1010</b> has tape portion <b>1090</b> of about ¾″ of an inch in length and tape portion <b>1100</b> about 1¼″ in length is treated to be non-sealable. Tape <b>1010</b> is formed from about 3 millimeter stock. In another variant, flange <b>1110</b> is manufactured (FIG. <b>9</b>). Flange <b>1110</b> has flange portion <b>1120</b> which is about ¾″ in length, and flange portion <b>1125</b> that is about 1¼″ in length. The inside high flange area portion <b>1130</b> is treated to be non-sealable. Either tape <b>1010</b> or flange <b>1110</b> are affixed to fastener profiles and processed as described herein.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 1 Apparatus <b>420</b> is provided, for indexing sealing tape <b>100</b> or flange <b>1110</b> to web <b>110</b>. Apparatus <b>420</b> is located behind (or upstream) of form, fill, seal bagger <b>410</b>. Apparatus <b>420</b> unwinds reclosable tape <b>100</b> or flange material <b>1110</b>, indexes, punch holes, and indexes tape <b>100</b> again to a location centered above the backside of the intended front panel <b>1170</b> of base web material <b>2154</b> (cross web) and cuts tape <b>100</b> or flange <b>1110</b> to a length that is just shy of the width W of front panel <b>1170</b> of the intended bag <b>1</b> (FIG. <b>1</b>).</p>
    <p>Concurrent with the steps described above, the apparatus feeds (indexes) base web <b>110</b> to a position that allows registration of the tape <b>100</b> or flange <b>1110</b> to just below the intended top portion <b>1090</b>FIG. 14 of the finished bag <b>1</b>. The next step of the method involves sealing as much of the lower flange area <b>1200</b> (FIGS. 6 and 7) and the side of the loop <b>1202</b> adjacent to the inside surface of the front panel area <b>1170</b> to the inside surface of web <b>110</b> as is practical. Step three of the method is to provide web <b>110</b>, now called web <b>340</b> to bagger <b>410</b>. In bagger <b>410</b>, in addition to making the normal cross sealing and cutting operations, the sealing bars <b>2159</b> are modified to seal the opposite side of the loop (or flange) areas <b>770</b>, (optionally <b>780</b>), to bag wall <b>2004</b> and <b>2028</b> having longitudinal seal <b>1267</b> thereon (FIG. <b>1</b>). It is appreciated that the width of tape <b>1010</b> or flange <b>770</b> permits wall sections <b>775</b> and <b>785</b> to be sealed to front panel <b>1170</b> and back panel <b>1265</b> of bag <b>1</b> relatively effortlessly, since substantially smooth, parallel, and unprofiled wall sections <b>775</b> and <b>785</b>, and front panel <b>1170</b> and back panel <b>1265</b> are sealed together as illustrated in FIG. 16 utilizing sealing means <b>1260</b>.</p>
    <p>As illustrated in FIGS. 14 and 15, the invention includes a tape <b>1010</b> for attachment to a web. The tape <b>1010</b> includes a zipper compatible inside portion <b>1000</b> for connection of zipper <b>980</b> to the zipper compatible, inside portion <b>1000</b>, and an outside portion <b>1030</b> compatible with sealant layer <b>970</b> of packaging material <b>960</b> for connection of outside portion <b>1030</b> to sealant layer <b>970</b>. In one variant the zipper compatible inside portion <b>1000</b> and the outside portion <b>1030</b> are incompatible. The zipper compatible inside portion <b>1000</b> is compatible with low density polyethylene compatible. The inside loop surface <b>1060</b> is treated so as to be incompatible, i.e. virtually non-sealable during the sealing process.</p>
    <p>In a variant, a simplified method of manufacturing the tape <b>1010</b> described above is provided that includes the step of coextruding a first base tape material to obtain zipper compatible inside surface portion <b>1000</b> and a second base tape <b>2210</b> material to obtain outside surface portion <b>1030</b>. Optionally, the method includes the step of fusing the zipper compatible inside portion <b>1000</b> to the outside portion <b>1030</b> to obtain a laminate structure (FIG. <b>14</b>). As shown in FIG. 5, the invention includes a web <b>440</b> for making reclosable bags <b>2001</b> comprising the tape <b>1010</b> on flange described hereto.</p>

Reclosable bag <b>2001</b> optionally includes indicia <b>2054</b> indicating where bag <b>2001</b> should be cut to provide a user access to interlocked fastener strip assembly <b>2048</b>. It is appreciated that bag <b>2001</b> can be used in many applications including, but not limited to, snack bag applications.</p>
    <p>Fastener tape segment (<b>2047</b>) has an interlocked fastener strip assembly <b>2048</b> including fastener profile strips <b>2012</b> and <b>2022</b>. Strips <b>2012</b> and <b>2022</b> are not sealed to confronting bag walls <b>2004</b> and <b>2028</b>. Fastener strip <b>2012</b> is sealed to film strip <b>2006</b> at continuous seal <b>2010</b>, and complimentary strip <b>2022</b> is sealed to film strip <b>2026</b> at continuous seal <b>2024</b>. Film strip <b>2006</b> is sealed to bag wall <b>2004</b> at continuous seal <b>2002</b>, and film strip <b>2026</b> is sealed to bag wall <b>2028</b> at seals continuous seals <b>2008</b>, and <b>2030</b>. Barrier material strips <b>2014</b>, <b>2020</b> are interposed between film strips <b>2006</b>, <b>2026</b>. It is appreciated that, as shown in FIG. 16, fastener <b>2012</b> is sealed to wall <b>2004</b> only at seal <b>2002</b> and sealed to strip <b>2026</b> at seals <b>2038</b>, <b>2044</b>. Thus, a portion of strip <b>2006</b> and fastener <b>2012</b> are free to move relative to wall <b>2004</b>. Barrier material strip <b>2014</b> is sealed to film strip <b>2006</b> at seals <b>2016</b>, <b>2050</b>. Barrier material strip <b>2020</b> is sealed to film strip <b>2026</b> at continuous seals <b>2018</b> and <b>2052</b>. Barrier material strips <b>2014</b>, <b>2020</b> are made from material that is not capable of sealing to itself at temperatures at which film strips <b>2006</b>, <b>2026</b> would seal to bag walls <b>2004</b> and <b>2028</b>. It is appreciated that seals <b>2002</b>, <b>2008</b>, <b>2010</b>, <b>2016</b>, <b>2018</b>, <b>2024</b>, <b>2030</b> can be made by conventional methods known in the art.</p>
    <p>It is understood that reclosable bag <b>2001</b> is generally formed in a form, fill and seal machine (as shown in FIG. <b>1</b>), in which walls <b>2004</b>, and <b>2028</b> are formed from a base web <b>2032</b> having a longitudinal direction of flow in the bag formation process as indicated by arrow <b>2045</b>′ (FIG. <b>17</b>). Base web <b>2032</b> is joined to itself at back seal <b>2062</b> (FIG. 19) that extends between bag top end <b>2058</b>A and bottom end <b>2059</b>A along one side of bag body <b>2003</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 18, fastener strips <b>2012</b> and <b>2022</b> are formed from continuous one-piece extruded resiliently flexible plastic profiled reclosable fastener strip material. Fastener strips <b>2012</b> and <b>2022</b> are also sealed one to another at seals <b>2038</b>, and <b>2044</b> (FIG. 17) so that the strips are in alignment with one another and interlocked together. It is appreciated that provision of seals <b>2038</b>, <b>2044</b>, in combination with the other seals herein, provide a hermetic seal so that the only access to the interior of bag <b>2001</b> is provided upon releaseably disengaging fasteners <b>2012</b>, <b>2022</b>. FIG. 17 illustrates base web <b>2032</b> for making a, plurality of reclosable bags <b>2001</b>. Base web <b>2032</b> is formed from conventional materials used in the snack bag and plastic bag industries such as polyethylene, paper/poly/foil/poly laminates, propylene, and other laminated and coated material. The base web <b>2032</b>, is utilized in the method and apparatus described herein, and in FIGS. 20-33. Base web <b>2032</b> is an elongated roll of film having a longitudinal direction of formation indicated by arrow <b>2045</b>′. Base web <b>2032</b> has secured thereto a fastener tape segment <b>2047</b> at transverse fastener tape segment seal <b>2036</b>. In a preferred embodiment, seal <b>2036</b> extends continuously from fastener tape segment end <b>2043</b> to fastener tape segment end <b>2045</b>. In an alternate embodiment, seal <b>2036</b> includes a plurality of spot seals for securing strip portion <b>2046</b> of fastener tape segment <b>2047</b> to base web <b>2032</b>. It is appreciated that securing strip portion <b>2046</b> is sized and dimensioned to provide a large vertical sealing area in which transverse fastener tape segment seal <b>2036</b> can be disposed. Seal <b>2036</b> can be placed at any location in portion <b>2046</b>. Seal <b>2036</b> can also include spot seals at any location in the sealing area. Hence, optional film lip <b>2034</b> (FIGS. 16-18) located below transverse fastener tape segment seal <b>2036</b> can be of varying height, but is preferably about an eight of an inch in height. In another variant, optional film lip <b>2034</b> is omitted.</p>
    <p>Non-barrier containing upper portion <b>2040</b> (FIG. 17) of film strips <b>2006</b> and <b>2026</b> (FIG. 16) has an optional gap between the bottom edges <b>2041</b> and <b>2041</b> of barrier material <b>2014</b> and <b>2020</b> and fasteners <b>2012</b> and <b>2022</b>. Barrier containing upper portion <b>2042</b> (FIG. 17) includes the portions of film strips <b>2006</b> and <b>2026</b> upon which barrier material <b>2014</b> and <b>2020</b> are disposed.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 17, secured to web material <b>2032</b> at bag length intervals L are a plurality of fastener tape segments <b>2047</b>, sealed along the length of web <b>2032</b> and extending lengthwise across about less than half the width of web <b>2032</b>. The fastener tape segments <b>2047</b> are oriented substantially perpendicularly to the direction of formation of the bag <b>2001</b>, and are located near the ends of the bags into which web material <b>2032</b> is formed.</p>
    <p>It is appreciated that fastener tape segment <b>2047</b> and the securing thereof to web <b>2032</b> prior to the formation of bag body <b>2003</b> in a form fill seal machine <b>2138</b> has a number of benefits. First, it is not necessary to directly seal the narrow individual fasteners <b>2012</b> and <b>2022</b> to the web. Sealing bars <b>2159</b> of sealing bar assembly <b>2167</b> (FIG. 20) seal securing strip portion <b>2046</b> to web material <b>2032</b> at seal <b>2036</b> FIG. <b>18</b>. Further, as the web material <b>2032</b> (having fastener tape segment <b>2047</b> thereon), travels in the direction of arrow <b>2045</b>′ onto the forming collar <b>2140</b> of a form fill seal machine <b>2138</b> (FIGS. <b>30</b>-<b>31</b>), there is a minimal risk that fasteners <b>2012</b> and <b>2022</b> (FIG. 18) will come apart when the web material is being processed. Further, seals <b>2038</b> and <b>2044</b>FIG. 17 secure fasteners <b>2012</b> and <b>2022</b> to each other, to prevent undesirable movement of one fastener in relation to another. Seals <b>2038</b> and <b>2044</b> also improve overall rigidity of segment <b>2047</b> and maintain fasteners <b>2012</b> and <b>2022</b> in alignment with one another during the bag formation process. It is appreciated that fastener tape segment <b>2047</b> may also function as an air foil as the current of air flows over the tape segment <b>100</b>A in a direction opposite that indicated by arrow <b>2045</b>′. Various types of barrier material can be used herein. However, the barrier material strips <b>2014</b> and <b>2020</b> do not seal one to another during the bag formation process, but readily seal to film strips <b>2006</b> and <b>2026</b> (FIG. <b>16</b>).</p>
    <p>FIGS. 20-33 shown an apparatus for manufacturing and sealing tape segments <b>2047</b> to base web <b>2179</b> and then using a form fill seal machine <b>2138</b> for making bag <b>2001</b> of the present invention. The form fill seal machine <b>2138</b> includes a zipper tape feed <b>2199</b> portion as shown in FIGS. 20-24. The zipper tape feed portion <b>2199</b> includes tension arm <b>2100</b> (FIGS. 20-24) for tensioning finished fastener tape <b>2240</b> (from which segments <b>2047</b> are formed) and for signaling fastener spool drive <b>2114</b> (FIG. 20-24) to rotate spool <b>2108</b>. Fastener tape <b>2240</b> unwinds from zipper spool <b>2108</b> (FIGS. 20-24) and advances over roller <b>2070</b> and under a roller on floating arm <b>2106</b> (FIGS. 20, <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>23</b>) connected to film synchronizer <b>2112</b> (FIG. <b>20</b>), and over roller <b>2174</b>. Fastener tape <b>2240</b> then passes under ultrasonic sealing horn <b>2102</b> (FIGS. 20, <b>20</b>A, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, and <b>24</b>) where seals <b>2038</b>, and <b>2044</b> are formed, through tape registration assembly <b>2105</b>, and into tape drive assembly <b>2107</b>. Tape registration assembly <b>2105</b>, in combination with tape drive assembly <b>2107</b> advances tape <b>100</b> sequentially into tape cutter assembly <b>2109</b>. Proper tension is maintained by rollers <b>2111</b>, <b>2113</b> and <b>2115</b> (FIG. 20A) in tape registration assembly <b>2105</b>, which adjusts tension based on the position of three loop dancer <b>490</b>, and activation by photo sensor <b>460</b> (FIG. <b>1</b>). Tape drive assembly <b>2107</b> includes nip drive <b>470</b> for feeding tape <b>100</b>, as required into tape cutter assembly <b>2109</b>. Nip drive assembly <b>470</b> includes rollers <b>2111</b>A, <b>2113</b>A and <b>2115</b>A for advancing tape <b>100</b>. When cutting die plate actuator <b>2117</b> pushes die plate <b>2119</b> forward under tape <b>100</b>. Cutter blade <b>2121</b> then cuts downwardly through tape <b>100</b> by means of an air piston <b>2123</b> and shaft <b>2125</b> having blade <b>2121</b> attached to the distal end <b>2127</b> thereof. After full extension of shaft <b>2125</b>, cutter blade <b>2121</b> is retracted, as is die plate <b>2119</b>. A stripper <b>2129</b> helps strip tape <b>100</b> from blade <b>2121</b> and in fact urges tape segment <b>100</b>A into tape sealer vacuum assembly <b>2131</b>. Thus, fastener tape <b>2240</b> is cut into predetermined sections the length of segment <b>2047</b>. It is preferred that segments <b>2047</b> be about less than half of the width of base web <b>2179</b>. The control synchronizer <b>2110</b> (FIG. 23) synchronizes the feeding of fastener tape <b>2240</b> with the feeding of base web <b>2179</b> (FIG. 25) so that segments <b>2047</b> can be properly processed as described and sealed to base web <b>2179</b>. The various operations are actuated by air pressure controls <b>2104</b> (FIGS. 20, <b>21</b>, and <b>22</b>).</p>
    <p>Segment <b>2047</b> is next fed into fastener segment attachment assembly <b>2101</b> (FIG. <b>28</b>). Fastener segment attachment assembly <b>2101</b> secures segment <b>2047</b> to base web <b>2179</b> and forms seal <b>2036</b>. Base web <b>2179</b> advances into machine <b>2138</b> under the control of film speed quantity control <b>2116</b> (FIGS. <b>25</b> and <b>26</b>). Base web <b>2179</b> is mounted on web spool drive <b>2118</b> (FIG. 25) that includes positioning shaft <b>2120</b> (FIG. <b>26</b>). Base web <b>2179</b> travels through dancer rollers <b>2126</b> (FIG. <b>26</b>) prior to arrival at fastener segment attachment assembly <b>2101</b> at the rear <b>2122</b> thereof.</p>
    <p>Segment <b>2047</b> is properly positioned and sealed on base web <b>2179</b> with a vacuum belt and sealing bar assembly <b>2131</b> (FIGS. 20-B, <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>) having a front portion <b>2124</b> and rear portion <b>2122</b>. The sealing bar <b>2131</b> assembly forms seal <b>2036</b> and positions segment <b>2047</b> on base web <b>2179</b> at an appropriate location. FIG. 26 illustrates the rear portion <b>2122</b> of vacuum belt <b>2132</b> and sealing bar assembly <b>2131</b>. FIG. 27 illustrates that front portion <b>2124</b> of vacuum belt <b>2132</b> and sealing bar assembly. FIG. 28 illustrates vacuum belt <b>2132</b> and sealing bar assembly front portion <b>2124</b> including a belt drive <b>2169</b> for vacuum belt <b>2132</b> (FIG. 28) and vacuum belt <b>2132</b> (FIG. 28) which advances segment <b>2047</b> and properly positions segment <b>2047</b> on base web <b>2179</b>. Four vacuum zones <b>2049</b>-<b>2051</b>, <b>2053</b> and <b>2055</b> in vacuum manifold <b>2056</b> maintain tight control of segment <b>2047</b>, and then in turn reverse air pressure and force segment <b>2047</b> fixedly against web <b>2179</b>. Vacuum belt <b>2132</b> and sealing bar assembly <b>2131</b> include a horizontal sealing bar <b>2059</b>, a tape support shelf <b>2161</b> and a sealing bed <b>2162</b>. Sealing bar <b>2059</b> includes a heating element <b>2165</b>, and is mounted on a sealing bar press assembly <b>2167</b> which forces sealing bar <b>2059</b> downward against tape segment <b>100</b>A for sealing to base web <b>2047</b>. Vacuum belt assembly <b>2131</b> also includes a belt drive <b>2169</b> which advances tape segment <b>100</b>A (<b>2047</b>) into the desired position over base web <b>2179</b>. Prior to sealing, tight control of positioning of tape segment <b>100</b>A is maintained by manifolds <b>2049</b>, <b>2051</b>, <b>2053</b> and <b>2055</b>, as is the vacuum belt <b>2132</b> is advanced, controlled by tape registration assembly <b>2105</b> and tape drive assembly <b>2107</b>.</p>
    <p>As shown in FIG. 20-A, a roller drive <b>2130</b> for vacuum belts <b>2132</b> is shown. Roller drive <b>2130</b> comprises a servo motor <b>469</b> contained in container <b>2130</b>A having a drive shaft <b>2130</b>B. Shaft <b>2130</b>B has a sprocket at <b>2130</b>C on the distal end thereof. A rubber belt <b>2130</b>D is disposed around sprocket <b>2130</b>C and extends to a hub <b>2115</b>A on nip roller <b>2115</b>. Hub <b>2115</b>A has a similar sprocket <b>2115</b>B so that as shaft <b>2130</b>B rotates it causes rotation of shaft <b>2130</b>B. When rubber belt <b>2130</b>D is driven it causes rotation of nip roller <b>2115</b>. At the same time nip roller <b>2115</b> has a double hub <b>2115</b>C so that a second belt <b>2130</b>E extends therefrom over idle roller <b>2130</b>F and drive roller <b>2130</b>G on vacuum belt assembly <b>2131</b>. It should be noted in this regard that idle roller <b>2130</b>F could be a drive roller for use in a mechanically powered cutter assembly (not shown), replacing air piston <b>2123</b> (FIG. <b>20</b>-A), if desired. Belts <b>2130</b>E are again driven by hub <b>2115</b>A, which drives belt <b>2130</b>E which is mounted on sprocket <b>2130</b>H, thereby causing rotation of drive roller <b>2130</b>G. Thus, tape <b>100</b> is advanced by nip rollers <b>2113</b> and <b>2115</b>, incrementally under cutter blades <b>2121</b>, then stopped at the appropriate distance. Cutter blade <b>2121</b> then is pushed downwardly by air piston <b>2123</b> as is clamp <b>2121</b> A. Clamp <b>2121</b> A also forces spring loaded stripper <b>2109</b>A downwardly and out of the way of cutting blade <b>2121</b>. After cutting blade <b>2121</b> has cut tape segment <b>270</b>, air piston <b>2123</b> is reversed so that shaft <b>2125</b> is pulled upwardly, thereby releasing Clamp <b>2121</b>A and spring loaded stripper <b>2109</b>A. Servo motor <b>469</b> than is actuated causing rotation of driver roller and hub <b>2215</b>A <b>2130</b>G, and <b>2130</b>B so as to cause advancement of nip roller <b>2115</b> and vacuum belt <b>2132</b>. Vacuum belt <b>2132</b> then picks up the leading edge of cut tape segment <b>270</b> and advances it over web <b>110</b>, (FIG. 1) where heat sealing is applied as shown in figure <b>20</b>A. It should be noted that the spring loaded stripper <b>2109</b>A, when it moves upwardly causes the leading edge of tape segment <b>270</b> to spring upward against vacuum belt <b>2132</b> so as to facilitate advancement of tape segment <b>270</b> and prevent jamming of the segment <b>270</b> in the slot <b>2109</b>B in retractable die plate <b>2119</b> (FIG. <b>20</b>A). Further shown in (FIG. 20A) is a ledge <b>2171</b> for which prevents the movement of web <b>110</b> below vacuum belt <b>2132</b> from causing displacement of tape segment <b>270</b> on vacuum belt <b>2132</b>, as advancing tape segment <b>100</b>A into position over web <b>110</b>. The ledge <b>2171</b> is constructed of DELRIN brand thermoplastic elastomer so as to provide a slick surface and to eliminate static electricity created by the movement of web <b>110</b> approximate thereto. Alternatively, other materials such TEFLON (polyethylene-terephthalate) could be used.</p>
    <p>After the segment <b>2047</b> is sealed to base web <b>2179</b> rubber nip roller <b>2128</b> (FIGS. 27 and 28) advances the base web <b>2179</b> having segment <b>2047</b> forward. The base web <b>2179</b> having segment <b>2047</b> is then fed through form fill seal machine <b>2138</b> dancer rolls <b>2136</b> (FIG. 29) into the form fill seal portion of machine <b>2138</b> (FIG. <b>32</b>). The base web <b>2179</b> having segment <b>2047</b> sealed thereon is fed over forming collar <b>2140</b> (FIG. 32) and filling tube <b>2142</b> (FIGS. 30-31) by the belts <b>2181</b> and <b>2183</b> shown in FIGS. <b>32</b>. Back seal <b>2062</b> is formed. Sealing bar <b>2159</b> and cutting knife assembly <b>2144</b> (FIG. 33) form seals <b>2056</b>, <b>2058</b>, and <b>2060</b> simultaneously and sever the finished bag. Sealing bar <b>2159</b> includes first set of sealing bars (not shown) and second set of sealing bars <b>2058</b>′. The first set of sealing bars (not shown) forms seal <b>2056</b>. The second set of sealing bars <b>2058</b>′ forms seal <b>2058</b>. Seal bar <b>2058</b>′ forms seal <b>2058</b>. Seal bar <b>2060</b>′ forms seal <b>2060</b>. Knife <b>2144</b> cuts the partially formed bag between seal bars <b>2058</b>′ and <b>2060</b>′. It is appreciated that this method of forming seals <b>2058</b> and <b>2060</b> with sealing jaws <b>2058</b>′ and <b>2060</b>′ provides a benefit. Seal <b>2058</b> having a width W at top portion <b>2000</b> is generally narrower than seal <b>2060</b> having a width W. This facilitates opening of the top end of bag <b>2001</b> by providing a weaker seal at the top end of bag <b>2001</b> than at the bottom end of the bag while simultaneously providing a hermetic seal of the top end of the bag and a stronger lower seal at the lower end of the bag. Hence, it is appreciated that the invention provides for a bag <b>2001</b> that requires a differential opening force to open the top end of the bag versus the bottom end of the bag.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 35-38 illustrate a bag and method of forming a bag in a horizontal form fill seal machine <b>2138</b>. A web of thermoplastic material which is preferably about 1 mil thick and is a laminate material is formed and wound on standard 3 or 6 inch cores to be used as interior end cap <b>2146</b>. Interior end cap <b>2146</b> goes through an operation in which perforations <b>2150</b> are formed thereon as indicated in FIG. <b>34</b>. The laminate material from which interior end cap <b>2146</b> is formed is a non-stretchy base thermoplastic material such as polypropylene with a thin sealant layer <b>2562</b> on one side thereof, or on each side thereof. The preferred width of the finished roll of interior end cap <b>2146</b> is about three and one half inches or less. The web material is perforated in the web direction as shown in FIG. <b>34</b>.</p>
    <p>A modified AMI-RD (reduced size applicator for connecting fastener and interior cap <b>2148</b> to web) applicator system <b>120</b> is used for the application of interior cap <b>2146</b> and webless fastener <b>2152</b> (FIGS. 37-39) to base web <b>2154</b> (FIGS. 36-38) for the manufacture of bags. The method of making the bags includes the steps of sealing interior cap <b>2146</b> onto base web <b>2154</b> to obtain interior cap/web assembly <b>2148</b>, center folding the interior cap/web assembly <b>2148</b> to obtain folded base web <b>2156</b> (FIGS. <b>36</b>-<b>38</b>), introducing webless fastener <b>2226</b>, <b>2152</b> between the opposing walls <b>2567</b> of the folded base web <b>2156</b> (FIGS. <b>36</b>-<b>38</b>), and sealing fastener <b>2152</b> to opposing walls <b>2567</b>. Fastener <b>2152</b> and header <b>3014</b> (FIG. 39) are sealed at the same RD station. In lieu of opening the web, as an RD system <b>120</b> ordinarily does, the folded base web <b>2156</b> is turned and delivered to a horizontal “shred” machine (not shown), in line and at the height desired. As shown in FIGS. 37 and 38, fastener <b>2152</b> can be sealed at the ends of interior cap <b>2158</b> (FIG. 37) or to a sealant layer of base web <b>2156</b> (FIGS. 35 and 37) at fastener seals <b>2162</b>, <b>2164</b> (FIG. <b>39</b>). Header seals <b>2166</b> (FIG. 39) and fastener seals <b>2162</b> and <b>2164</b> can be formed simultaneously or at different stations. The web is delivered, in-line and upright, to a horizontal machine.</p>
    <p>The finished package is substantially flat and neat, improving package appearance, and the overall improving quality of the package. The function of opening the package is improved since the package is opened via the tear notch, (perforations <b>2150</b>), and along the perforations <b>2150</b>. Then, when header <b>3014</b> is completely torn off by the user, the opening tabs are completely intact and parallel. Since the package is more uniform, opening and reclosing the bag is made easier using the reclosable fastener <b>2152</b>. The machinery for making the above referenced invention includes continuous moving operations that require less maintenance and result in more reliable operation.</p>
    <p>Optionally, base web <b>2156</b> includes perforations <b>2151</b> that are complementary to and aligned with perforations <b>2150</b> of interior cap <b>2146</b>. It is appreciated that perforations <b>2150</b> and <b>2151</b>FIG. 39A allow a user to readily open the bag formed with these elements, and easily access the bag formed utilizing these elements. Perforations <b>2150</b>, <b>2151</b> are preferably located between centerfold <b>2269</b> and fastener assembly <b>2152</b>. In an alternate embodiment, perforations <b>2150</b> are omitted.</p>
    <p>FIG. 39<i>a </i>is a top plan view of a reclosable bag <b>3060</b> made from the web of FIG. <b>35</b>. Bag <b>3060</b> includes a header <b>3014</b>, a bottom seal <b>3100</b>, and side seals <b>3070</b>, and <b>3080</b> forming bag body. Fastener assembly <b>2152</b> is positioned below perforations <b>2150</b> and <b>2151</b> so that when header <b>3014</b> is removed, a tear forms along perforations <b>2150</b> and <b>2151</b> providing access to reclosable fastener assembly <b>2152</b>.</p>
    <p>FIG. 40 illustrates a variant of the top portion of bag <b>2001</b> that includes means for easy access to fasteners <b>2012</b>, <b>2022</b>. The top end of bag <b>2001</b> includes adhesive layer <b>2168</b> (FIG. 40) above fastener segment <b>2047</b> but below bag wall ends <b>3042</b>, <b>3044</b>. This adhesive layer <b>2168</b> is applied using conventional adhesives that are readily separated by the mechanical opening force generated by a user's fingers. This adhesive layer <b>2168</b> hermetically holds together and seals walls <b>2004</b> and <b>2028</b> during shipment and storage of bag <b>2001</b>. Adhesive layer <b>2168</b> can be applied to web <b>2032</b> before the web moves onto the forming collar <b>2140</b>. Opening of the bag <b>2001</b> to access interlocked fasteners <b>2012</b>, <b>2022</b> is facilitated by provision of bag wall pull flanges <b>2170</b> and <b>2172</b> (FIG. 40) which are formed from bag walls, <b>2004</b> and <b>2028</b>. It is also contemplated that the inside and/or outside surfaces <b>3046</b>, <b>3048</b>, <b>3050</b>, <b>3052</b> of bag wall pull flanges <b>2170</b> and <b>2172</b> can be textured, ribbed or grooved so that gripping thereof by a user and opening of the bag top can be facilitated.</p>
    <p>FIG. 41 illustrates an apparatus <b>2200</b> for forming fastener tape <b>2240</b>. Apparatus is used to make fastener tape <b>2240</b> described herein using the methods described herein. Base tape <b>2206</b> is fed from roll of tape material <b>2202</b> onto dancer rollers <b>2208</b>. Barrier material <b>2210</b> is fed from roll of barrier material <b>2204</b> onto dancer rollers <b>2212</b>. Barrier material <b>2210</b> and base tape <b>2206</b> are aligned, and positioned with respect to each other. In one variant the center of barrier material <b>2210</b> is aligned with the center of base tape <b>2206</b>. In another variant, the barrier material <b>2210</b> is positioned on base tape <b>2206</b> to provide for portion <b>2046</b>. Barrier material <b>2210</b> and base tape <b>2206</b> are sealed to each other and advanced by belts <b>2214</b> and <b>2216</b>. Sealing bars <b>2218</b> and <b>2220</b> seal barrier material <b>2210</b> to base tape <b>2206</b> at seals <b>2016</b>, <b>2050</b>, <b>2018</b> and <b>2052</b> to obtain a sealed barrier/base material assembly <b>3017</b>. The seals may be continuous or periodic. Sealed barrier/base material assembly <b>3017</b> is next folded at fold station <b>2222</b>. The barrier material <b>2210</b> is directed to the inside of the assembly <b>3017</b> and the base tape <b>2206</b>, material is directed to the outside of the assembly <b>3017</b>. Webless fastener <b>2226</b> is fed from roll of webless fastener <b>2228</b> and aligned and positioned between the base tape <b>2206</b> material as shown in the figures herein. Optionally base tape material <b>2206</b> may be fed by roller <b>2224</b>. Belts <b>2230</b> and <b>2232</b> advance the materials and sealing bars <b>2234</b>, <b>2236</b> seal the webless fastener <b>2226</b> (interlocked profiles <b>2012</b>, <b>2022</b>) to assembly <b>3017</b>. The fold formed at fold station <b>2222</b> is slit at slitting station <b>2238</b> to provide the finished fastener tape <b>2240</b>, which may then be rolled into a roll of finished fastener tape <b>2242</b>, or used immediately. Preferably, the base tape material <b>2206</b> is about 3.5 inches wide while the barrier material strip <b>2210</b> is about 2 inches wide.</p>
    <p>A method of making tape <b>2240</b> having reclosable fasteners <b>2226</b> thereon is provided. The method comprises the steps of supplying a continuous strip of tape <b>2206</b>, a continuous strip of barrier material <b>2210</b>, and a continuous strip of fastener <b>2226</b> having first and second interlocked fastener profile strips <b>2012</b>, <b>2022</b>; positioning continuous strip of barrier material <b>2210</b> on continuous strip of tape <b>2206</b>; securing continuous strip of barrier material <b>2210</b> to continuous strip of tape <b>2206</b> to obtain a continuous strip of barrier tape <b>3017</b>; folding, (off-center, or center folding) barrier tape to obtain a fold and two opposing barrier tape fastener strip connecting portions; positioning fasteners <b>2226</b> having first and second interlocked fastener profile strips <b>2012</b>, <b>2022</b> between the two opposing barrier tape fastener strip connecting portions; securing the first interlocked fastener profile strip <b>2012</b> to one of said opposing barrier tape fastener strip connecting portions; securing the second interlocked fastener profile strip <b>2022</b> to the other barrier tape fastener strip connecting portion; and, slitting the fold to form two separate continuous strips of barrier material <b>2210</b> (strips <b>2014</b>, <b>2020</b>), and slitting the base web <b>2032</b>, <b>2154</b> to separate the base web <b>2032</b>, <b>2154</b> into strips of thermoplastic material.</p>
    <p>The invention described herein which secures the segment <b>2047</b> to a base film is independent of the form fill seal apparatus <b>2138</b> ultimately used to form fill and seal bag <b>2001</b>. Two sets of dancers <b>2134</b> and <b>2136</b> (FIG. 29) are used so that any bagger apparatus <b>2138</b> can be retrofitted. Barrier material <b>2210</b> is polypropylene on the inside and polyethylene on the outside so that seals <b>2018</b>, <b>2052</b>, <b>2016</b>, and <b>2050</b> can be formed while the inside surfaces <b>3073</b> are non-sealable one to another. In a preferred embodiment, the sealing side of barrier material <b>2210</b> has blended therein metalasine. The materials described herein are commercially available from Curwood Co., 220 Badger Ave., Oshkosh, Wis., Atlanta Film in the State of Atlanta, and Print Pak, Inc.</p>
    <p>In yet a further embodiment, it is possible to eliminate barrier material <b>2210</b>. In this embodiment shown in FIG. 42, a substantially pure, food grade, nitrocellulose coating <b>3990</b> is applied to base tape material <b>2206</b> as shown in FIG. <b>42</b>. The other method steps described above are performed to obtain the final fastener tape. Application of coating <b>3990</b> makes strips <b>2026</b> and <b>2006</b> (FIG. 16) non-sealable to one another in the inside loop area which is ultimately slit. It is further contemplated that other food grade coatings may be used to render strips <b>2026</b> and <b>2006</b> non-sealable one to another.</p>
    <p>FIG. 43 illustrates the top portion of a mono-polymer package <b>5003</b>, as for IQF (instant quick freeze) vegetables. In this variant, the embodiment of fastener tape as processed in FIG. 41 is used such that the tape has the substantially pure, food grade, nitrocellulose coating <b>3990</b> illustrated in FIG. <b>42</b>. Web <b>2206</b> is folded onto itself so that fasteners <b>2012</b> and <b>2022</b> interlock. Web <b>2206</b> is then slit as described above to obtain tape <b>2240</b> but without the barrier material strips. Suitable inks can also be used to make the strips non-sealable to one another.</p>
    <p>Seal <b>5000</b> is made with a bagger sealing jaw (not shown) in the shape of the seal illustrated in FIG. <b>43</b>. Seal <b>5000</b> is disposed approximately ¾″ below top seal <b>5002</b> in a preferred embodiment. Seal <b>5000</b> is similar to top seal <b>2058</b> and bottom seal <b>2060</b> in the other figures, but in this variant top seal <b>5002</b> and bottom seal <b>2060</b> (not shown) can be of the same size. The extra layers of strips <b>2006</b> and <b>2026</b> (FIG. 16) that are sealed to bag walls <b>2028</b> and <b>2004</b>, while they do create some extra thickness, do not create a thickness of material that is beyond the capability of the sealing jaw to properly seal, even when the bagger sealing jaw is in the same plane as the sealing jaws that create the top and bottom seals <b>2058</b>, <b>2060</b>. Due to the lack of thickness of the strips <b>2006</b>, <b>2026</b>, seal <b>5000</b> readily blends from four thicknesses to about two thicknesses. Hence, seal <b>5000</b> is continuous with no break in seal quality even though it comprises a step down from the four thicknesses to the two thicknesses.</p>
    <p>In some application such as IQF that do not require the bag to be hermetically sealed, there is no need to seal off the ends of the fastener strip. Seal <b>5000</b> extends to and through the side fold of bag <b>5003</b>, as top seal <b>5002</b> and bottom seal <b>2060</b> (not shown) do. This allows seal <b>5000</b> to be made with the same seal bars, regardless of bag width. The finished package <b>5003</b> can be filled with its contents above the zipper profile line <b>5004</b>. The fastener strip is sealed to the front panel of bag <b>5003</b> and the product content of the package can be filled above and behind the profiles horizontal location, as the thin strip material will align itself with and be pushed against the front panel when being filled. The extra length of the package is the distance between the bottom of the top seal <b>5005</b> and the bottom of seal <b>5000</b>. This distance is proportional to the accuracy of bagger registration.</p>
    <p>FIGS. 44 and 45 illustrate reclosable plastic bag <b>1</b> of the present invention. Reclosable plastic bag <b>1</b> includes a top end generally indicated by numeral <b>2</b> and a bottom end indicated by numeral <b>16</b>. Bag <b>1</b> has a front wall <b>3</b>, a back wall <b>4</b>, and a seal <b>5</b> at top end <b>2</b> at which interlocking fastener profile lip <b>6</b> is sealed to front wall <b>3</b> and sealed to back wall <b>4</b>. The tri-laminate structure at top end <b>2</b> of walls <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, and lip <b>6</b> increases the strength of top end <b>2</b> producing increased tear resistance at this portion of the bag during the manufacturing process and also when the bag is displayed at a retailer. Top end <b>2</b> optionally contains an aperture <b>14</b> that extends through walls <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, and lip <b>6</b> that is used to hang reclosable plastic bag <b>1</b> on hooks in retail stores. Bag <b>1</b> also has seal <b>2</b>′ at bottom end <b>16</b> at which front wall <b>3</b> and back wall <b>4</b> is connected. Back wall <b>4</b> includes two vertical portions <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> (FIG. 47) having ends <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> thereof that are sealed to create seal <b>24</b>.</p>
    <p>Interlocking fastener lip <b>6</b> is sealed to front wall <b>3</b>, and back wall <b>4</b> at top end <b>2</b> as indicated by seal <b>5</b> at top end <b>2</b>. Sealing of lip <b>6</b> is an important feature of the present invention since the size, shape and location of lip <b>6</b> allow for a single simultaneous sealing step to be used to seal front wall <b>3</b> to lip <b>6</b>, and lip <b>6</b> to back wall <b>4</b>. The seals of the present invention are preferably made by heat sealing as is well known in the art to prevent air or liquids from entering or leaving bag <b>1</b>. However, other forms of sealing can also be utilized herein. It is appreciated that the lip <b>6</b> can, in a variant, be disposed on the sides or bottom of bag <b>1</b> as required.</p>
    <p>Interlocking fastener lip <b>6</b> forms a portion of interlocking fastener strip assembly <b>18</b> that includes first engaging member <b>7</b> and a complimentary engaging member <b>8</b>. As illustrated in FIG. 45, complimentary engaging member <b>8</b> is illustrated as having a male engaging prong that releasably interlocks with engaging member <b>8</b> which is shown as a female receptacle. Male and female portions of members <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> can be readily interchanged. Many types of fastener assemblies are known in the reclosable plastic bag art and can be used with the present invention. Optionally, ends <b>20</b> of interlocking fastener lip <b>6</b> are heat sealed to front wall <b>3</b>.</p>
    <p>Lip <b>6</b> both reinforces top end <b>2</b> to prevent top end <b>2</b> from tearing where walls <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> are sealed to lip <b>6</b>; serves to flexibly attach first engaging member <b>7</b> to bag <b>1</b>, to support first engaging member <b>7</b>, and to align first engaging member <b>7</b> with complimentary engaging member <b>8</b>; and, serves as a fail-safe barrier to prevent or reduce the risk of contamination or release of the contents of bag <b>1</b> in the event of inadvertent or accidental separation of upper portion <b>9</b> from lower portion <b>10</b> of front wall <b>3</b> along optional rupture line <b>11</b> which can be manually manipulated to separate upper portion <b>9</b> from lower portion <b>10</b>. Preferably, score or rupture line <b>11</b> is frangible upon manual manipulation thereof by a user and is located above and substantially parallel to seal <b>12</b> at which complimentary engaging member <b>8</b> is joined to wall <b>3</b>. Score line or rupture line <b>11</b> serves the dual purpose of protecting the contents of the container and providing a safety seal to show that bag <b>1</b> has not yet been opened. Lip <b>6</b> can be formed of any material, but is preferably formed of the same material as the rest of bag <b>1</b>. Lip <b>6</b> can further contain advertising, nutritional or gaming indicia thereon.</p>
    <p>It is appreciated that lip <b>6</b> and front wall <b>3</b> further provide a pouch into which coupons, product samples, and/or other advertising material (not shown) can be placed. As such a consumer first opens front wall <b>3</b> along rupture line <b>11</b> to expose the material in the pouch without opening up the contents of the larger storage volume in bag <b>1</b>. It is further appreciated that this informational material is separated and protected from the contents of the remainder of bag <b>1</b> during the shipping and display process. The pouch of bag <b>1</b> can also contain material that is to be used in conjunction with the contents of the larger storage volume, but that needs to be separated from the larger storage volume material until it is needed.</p>
    <p>Multiple bags <b>1</b> as illustrated in FIGS. 44-46 are manufactured by supplying web material <b>1</b>, whether single ply or laminated to a form, fill and seal machine <b>28</b> as shown in FIG. <b>46</b>. Such machines are known in the art and include a combination bag forming and filling nozzle cylinder <b>29</b> adapted to receive products to be filled into the formed bags from a hopper <b>30</b>. Bag making web <b>31</b> has thereon complementary engaging members <b>8</b> sealed to portions of bag making web <b>31</b> that will become the front walls <b>3</b> of bags <b>1</b> in the manufacturing process. The complementary engaging member is releasably interlocked to engaging member <b>7</b> either before or after member <b>8</b> is sealed to wall <b>3</b> at appropriate intervals. At this juncture, end <b>27</b> of lip <b>6</b> is not joined to wall <b>3</b>. Web <b>31</b> is guided by means of guide roller <b>32</b> to the cylinder outer surface of cylinder <b>29</b>.</p>
    <p>At cylinder <b>29</b>, a folding or wrapping arm device <b>33</b> guides and wraps web <b>31</b> about the cylinder <b>29</b> with the longitudinal margins of web <b>31</b> brought together into a longitudinal assembly which is sealed to form closure seam <b>24</b>. Closure seam <b>24</b> is formed by vertical sealing bars <b>35</b> which move inward as indicated by numeral <b>37</b>. Bars <b>35</b> then separate to release the heat sealed seam <b>24</b> of the closed bag forming tube of web material <b>31</b>. Closed bag forming tube of web material <b>31</b> is advanced by means of a pair of horizontal, parallel bag end sealing bars <b>39</b> that reciprocate to clamp the bag web tube below the end of the cylindrical forming and filling nozzle member <b>29</b> and simultaneously seal the top end <b>2</b> of a filled bag section and the bottom end of a succeeding bag section.</p>
    <p>It is appreciated that sealing bars <b>39</b> simultaneously seal front wall <b>3</b> to end <b>27</b> of lip <b>6</b>, and end <b>27</b> of lip <b>6</b> to back wall <b>4</b> in a single step. Then sealing bars <b>39</b> still gripping the bag web tube move downwardly a bag section length as indicated by directional arrow <b>40</b> to pull and advance the entire bag making tube one bag length. As this step occurs, the next succeeding bag is filled with product dropped down cylinder <b>29</b> from hopper <b>30</b>. As bags are sealed and pulled down, a cut off bar <b>41</b> cuts midway across seals <b>2</b>′ and <b>5</b>, thus releasing the previously filled bags <b>1</b> which are handled as desired. Having completed its downward stroke cut off <b>41</b> returns to its starting position as indicated by arrow <b>43</b>.</p>
    <p>Bag <b>1</b> is airtight prior to the separation of upper portion <b>9</b> of front wall <b>3</b> from lower portion <b>10</b> of front wall <b>3</b> to gain access to recloseable fastener assembly <b>18</b>. Generally, a user will manually separate upper portion <b>9</b> from lower portion <b>10</b> manually at score, rupture line or perforation <b>11</b>. Separation of portions <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> will open up the first storage volume defined by upper portion <b>9</b> and lip <b>6</b>, to the environment. Fastener assembly <b>18</b> is then manipulated to open the second storage volume of bag <b>1</b> to the environment. Optionally upper portion <b>9</b> of wall <b>3</b> is scored to form a flap that includes three score lines, e.g. score line <b>11</b> and two score lines perpendicular thereto that start at score line <b>11</b> and terminate at seal <b>5</b> (not shown). The flap includes upper portion <b>9</b> of wall <b>3</b> and is pivotally connected to bag <b>1</b> at seal <b>5</b>. It is appreciated that provision of this flap allows for ease of access to fastener assembly <b>18</b>.</p>
    <p>The invention further provides a method of making reclosable bags that is more efficient and economical than conventional methods, and requires fewer method steps. Lip <b>6</b> is joined to walls <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> in a single sealing step rather than multiple sealing steps. As such the manufacturing process requires fewer sealing steps as only seals <b>5</b>, <b>2</b>′, <b>12</b>, and <b>24</b> are required to form the storage volume of bag <b>1</b> and also provide for the attachment of fastener assembly <b>18</b>. It is further appreciated that two distinct storage volumes are formed using the same number of sealing steps.</p>
    <p>Interlocking fastener lip <b>6</b> forming a portion of engaging member <b>7</b> is not sealed to walls <b>3</b> or <b>4</b> at this juncture but rather rests against the inside surface of front wall <b>3</b> and is attracted to front wall <b>3</b> by electrostatic forces. The fastener assembly (members <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>) are suitably longitudinally spaced at intervals along web <b>31</b>. Preferably, the width of fastener assembly is less than one half the width of web <b>31</b> so as to enable seal <b>24</b> to be formed. It is appreciated that the speed within which web <b>31</b> is fed into apparatus <b>28</b> is increased due to the consummation of multiple sealing steps simultaneously, and the time required to form, fill and seal a respective bag <b>1</b> is decreased.</p>
    <p>As illustrated in FIG. 47, web <b>50</b> includes a multiplicity of flexible interlocking fastener lips <b>6</b> which are free of connection to web <b>50</b>. That is, lips <b>6</b> simply rest on each respective sheet <b>55</b> of web <b>50</b> at this juncture. Each lip <b>6</b> is permanently connected to a fastener assembly <b>18</b>, is integral therewith, or optionally can be releasably attached thereto. Each fastener assembly <b>18</b> includes an engaging member releasably connected to a complimentary engaging member <b>8</b>. Complimentary engaging member <b>8</b> is connected to front wall portion <b>3</b> of web <b>50</b>. The web or bag film of the present invention is commonly referred to as plastic film and includes polymeric materials as are known in the art. It is appreciated that sealing or connecting only complimentary engaging member <b>8</b> to web <b>50</b> prior to formation of bag <b>1</b> or utilization of web <b>50</b> with apparatus <b>28</b> greatly simplifies and facilitates that manufacturing process. Sealing of lip <b>6</b> to front wall <b>3</b> during the formation of bag <b>1</b> provides numerous advantages in the manufacturing process including, by way of example, faster web feed times and the like.</p>
    <p>FIG. 48 is a side cross-sectional view of optional recloseable tape <b>150</b> used in bag <b>1</b>. Tape <b>150</b> has inside loop surface <b>152</b> that is treated to be non-sealable. Many compositions are known in the art that can make a surface non-sealable. An exemplary such composition is lacquer. In this embodiment, lip <b>6</b> has bend <b>154</b> and opposite wall <b>156</b> and lower flange area <b>158</b>. Both lower flange portion <b>158</b> and opposite wall <b>156</b> are sealed to front wall <b>3</b> of web <b>50</b> (FIG. <b>49</b>). In a preferred embodiment, distance D is about ¾ inches long and distance D′ is about 1¼ inches long. It is appreciated that distance D and distance D′ can be varied as required for the type of bag <b>1</b> manufactured (FIGS. <b>48</b> and <b>51</b>). Preferably, lip <b>6</b>, bend <b>154</b>, opposite wall <b>156</b>, and lower flange area <b>158</b> are formed from one piece of plastic material.</p>
    <p>It is appreciated that fastener or zipper <b>18</b> is completely sealed in the inside storage volume of bag <b>1</b> as illustrated in FIGS. 50 and 53. In this embodiment, bag <b>1</b> is free of tear tabs with perforations or tear strips. Rather, a perforation <b>70</b>′ or other indicia is printed across bag <b>1</b>, below or just below, top seal <b>5</b>. Bag <b>1</b> is opened along dotted line <b>70</b> with scissors or other suitable cutting utensil, and used as a normal recloseable bag <b>1</b> upon severance of bag <b>1</b> along the dotted line <b>70</b>.</p>
    <p>It is appreciated that bi-laminate upper gripping portions <b>72</b> created by sealing front wall <b>3</b> to lower flange area <b>158</b> and opposite wall <b>156</b>, and lip <b>6</b> to back wall <b>4</b> greatly extends the life of the gripping portion <b>72</b> even after multiple continued openings and closings of fastener <b>18</b>, and provides a reinforced base upon which both portions of fastener <b>18</b> are mounted. It is further appreciated that bi-laminate upper gripping portions <b>72</b> are more rigid than either walls <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, lip <b>6</b>, or opposite wall <b>156</b> alone, and facilitate the direct vertical insertion of products back into bag <b>1</b> through mouth <b>78</b> as indicated by arrow <b>74</b>′, after severance of bag <b>1</b> along line <b>72</b> and opening of fastener <b>18</b> (FIG. <b>57</b>). Bag <b>1</b> provides for a bag <b>1</b> having varying degrees of flexibility. These varying degrees of flexibility include more flexibility at front wall portion <b>3</b>′ below lower flange <b>158</b> and at back wall <b>4</b> below fastener <b>18</b> relative to the upper portion of bag <b>1</b> that includes the various tape <b>150</b> or flange <b>60</b> sealed thereto. This feature allows the storage volume <b>76</b>′ to readily adapt to the size and shape of products contained therein while simultaneously providing less flexible upper gripping portions <b>72</b> that facilitate alignment of the fastener <b>18</b> elements one with another, and closure thereof. The arrangement of the elements of the invention as described herein eliminates the risk of outside contamination during the time of storage of bag <b>1</b> or during store display due to the fail-safe recloseable features described herein. Only, when top seal <b>5</b> is cut off bag <b>1</b> does the recloseable fastener <b>18</b> reclosably seal off the bag contents in the bag storage volume without the protection of top seal <b>5</b>. Upper temporary storage volume <b>80</b>′ (FIGS. 50 and 53) optionally retains advertising literature and coupons as described above.</p>
    <p>FIG. 52 is a partial side cross-sectional view of lower flange portion <b>158</b> and opposite wall <b>156</b> of recloseable flange <b>60</b> sealed to a front web wall <b>3</b> of web <b>50</b>. In this variant high flange portions <b>62</b>, <b>63</b> are treated to be non-sealable. It is further appreciated that tape <b>150</b> and flange <b>60</b> can be constructed of materials that are about 3 mils in thickness or less. It is appreciated that the bi-laminte for upper gripping portions <b>72</b> allows for materials of decreased thickness to be used while still retaining the desired properties of bag <b>1</b>. Web <b>50</b> is constructed of materials of standard thickness as used in the construction of disposable bags.</p>
    <p>FIG. 55 is a side cross sectional view of the tape of FIG. 54 in an assembled bag <b>1</b>. Phantom line <b>55</b> of FIG. 54 indicates the location of the cross sectional view of FIG. <b>55</b>. Walls <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> are fusibly sealed one to another at fused seal <b>80</b> through apertures <b>70</b>, <b>71</b> disposed near ends <b>74</b>, <b>76</b>. Fused seal <b>80</b> is juxtaposed around the periphery <b>71</b>′ of aperture <b>72</b>.</p>
    <p>Apparatus (not shown) is provided to make recloseable tape <b>150</b> or flange material <b>60</b> and wind tape <b>150</b> or flange <b>60</b> into rolls <b>245</b> (FIG. <b>56</b>). The apparatus is located upstream of apparatus <b>28</b> and apparatus <b>200</b>. Apparatus <b>200</b> unwinds a roll of tape <b>150</b> or flange <b>60</b>, indexes as appropriate (advancing and indexing device <b>300</b>), and optionally punches holes <b>70</b>, <b>71</b> with hole punching device <b>160</b> near opposite ends <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> of lip <b>6</b>. Preferably holes <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> are in the range of about ⅜ of an inch to about ½ of an inch in diameter (FIG. 54) and are equidistant from ends <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> respectively. Holes <b>70</b>, <b>71</b> are made of a desired size and geometric shape, e.g. circular, oval, square, rectanguler, etc., depending upon the type of fusible seal <b>80</b> that is desired to be created (FIG. <b>55</b>).</p>
    <p>As illustrated in FIG. 56, apparatus <b>200</b> indexes again to a location centered above the backside of the intended front panel <b>3</b> of the basic web material <b>202</b> (cross web) and tape <b>150</b> or flange <b>60</b> is cut to a length that is less than the width of front panel <b>3</b> of bag <b>1</b>. Concurrent with the unwinding step described above, base web <b>202</b> is fed or indexed to a position that allows registration of zipper strip <b>18</b> (cross web) to just below the intended top of the finished bag <b>1</b> (advancing and indexing device <b>400</b>). Lower flange area <b>158</b> and ends <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> of lip <b>6</b>, fold <b>154</b> and opposite wall <b>156</b> adjacent to the inside surface of front panel <b>3</b> are substantially sealed to the inside surface of front panel <b>3</b> (seal bars <b>220</b>). As discussed above, the prepared web <b>50</b> is then fed to apparatus <b>28</b> as described above. Apparatus <b>28</b>, in addition to making the normal cross sealing and cutting operations, utilizes sealing bars that are modified and of a size and shape to seal the opposite side of the loop or flange area.</p>
    <p>While only a few, preferred embodiments of the invention have been described hereinabove, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the embodiment may be modified and altered without departing from the central spirit and scope of the invention. Thus, the preferred embodiment described hereinabove is to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims, rather than by the foregoing description, and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are intended to be embraced herein.</p>
